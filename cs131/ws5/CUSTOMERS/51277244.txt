US	51277244	R1K7UYQMSBR6H5	0060753226	657787398	Buddha Baby	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Strong second half	This is the story of Lindsey Owyang, the Chinese, San Franciscan heroine of Keltner's previous book, The Dim Sum of All Things. Lindsey has two jobs, one at a museum gift shop and the other at the Catholic school she attended as a child. She also has a loving boyfriend named Michael, who spends most of the book at a vegan retreat. He's doing an expose for the magazine he works for, called Vegan Warrior. <br /> <br />While Michael is away, Lindsey finds herself drawn to Dustin Lee, one of the few other Chinese students at her Catholic elementary school. Dustin left the school after sixth grade (one of the nuns had a crush on him and kept pulling him onto her lap), and she hadn't seen him since. Now he's back in town and looking pretty hot, with a motorcycle. Lindsey's suddenly wondering why she's never dated an Asian guy. Dustin, in turn, has only dated white women. <br /> <br />In another subplot, Lindsey starts to wonder about her cranky grandmother's past when she finds some photos in the basement at her school. After some visits with her grandfather and one of the current students at the school, she pieces together some answers. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is a little disjointed. Before Dustin appears on the scene, and Lindsey starts investigating her grandmother's past, there is really no suspense or dramatic question to drive the plot forward, and readers may find themselves putting the book down. But the second half of the book moves right along, as the reader will want to find out whether Lindsey gives in to the temptation of Dustin. <br /> <br />The book also has some interesting observations. Lindsey talks about \\"Angry Asian Men\\" who give her attitude because she dates white men (her boyfriend is a quarter Chinese, but no one can tell from his appearance). However, the book is a little heavy-handed in its treatment of Catholic school; one of the nuns tells Lindsey that the school is much improved, and \\"now only practices mild corporal punishment\\". <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fun, interesting book that picks up considerably in the second half. If you enjoyed The Dim Sum of All Things, you will probably enjoy this book as well.	2005-10-13
US	51277244	R3256SB9ZW2ATD	0060560371	425577436	Confessions of a Serial Dater	Books	4	3	3	N	N	I liked it	A lot of people are saying they didn't like this book as much as Michelle Cunnah's previous winners, 32AA and Call Waiting. I have to disagree. I think if you liked her other books, you'll like this one. <br /> <br />It's true that this book lacks a fun conceit like small-breastedness. Here, the heroine has wide feet and difficulty finding stylish shoes that fit, which is somehow just not as catchy. But the plot and characters make up for this. Rosie, our heroine, is much more capable than the heroine of 32AA and Call Waiting. Rosie is the successful co-owner of a business, Odd Jobs, and she also takes good care of her mother. <br /> <br />The only area where Rosie is not thriving is her love life. However, instead of being incurably single like many chick lit heroines, she has an overabundance of men in her life. At one point in the story, she finds herself at a table where she has slept with every man but one!  <br /> <br />The central man in the story is Luke, or Dr. Love, an obstetrician who catches Rosie's eye at a dull work do. After a romantic night together, Rosie finds out that Dr. Love is married, and she tries to avoid him, though she runs into him and his wife everywhere. Then Rosie's competitive cousin, Elaine, starts to pursue Dr. Love. <br /> <br />Elaine is a masterpiece. She's one of those people who orchestrates situations so that everyone else will feel maximum embarrassment and humiliation. We all know someone like this and Michelle Cunnah brings Elaine to life. <br /> <br />It's somewhat predictable whom Rosie will end up with, but there are so many entertaining twists and turns along the way that I didn't really mind.	2005-10-09
US	51277244	R11P13EEWEUPHA	141650754X	7915263	Cold Feet	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Pretty good collection	This is a pretty good collection of stories about women who are afraid of nuptials -- usually their own, but the last story features a woman who is afraid of someone else's because she's agoraphobic (afraid to go outside). If you like Downtown Press novels, you will probably enjoy this collection, which features all Downtown Press writers. <br /> <br />The first story, \\"Perfect Weather for Driving\\" by Elise Juska, was one of my favorites. Although Elise Juska's writing style is kind of slow and reflective, the plot and characters were engaging. The story is about a woman who is dating a workaholic. They have no plans to get engaged, but they're attending a wedding, and of course this makes them assess their own relationship. The woman is keeping a secret from the man. <br /> <br />The second story, \\"Losing California\\" by Tara McCarthy, was just okay. I didn't really like her novel, \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart,\\" and this story followed the same formula: lots of stuff about the music industry, an overabundance of quick plot turns that leave you jarred, and an unsatisfying ending. If you skip this one you're not really missing anything. <br /> <br />The third story, \\"Sara King Goes Bad\\" by Pamela Ribon, had its good points. It's about a good girl who goes bad, just for one night. I won't give away the details but it seems as if the things she does are too easily forgiven. I know for one my husband would be very upset if I did them.  <br /> <br />The fourth story, \\"The Happiest Day of Your Life\\" by Heather Swain, was very good although something disturbing happened in it. Heather Swain has a gift for creating a warm, cozy family setting that makes you want to read more. In this story, there's a conflict between her mellow Wisconsin family and her Brooklyn lifestyle, more specifically her plans to get married in Brooklyn. <br /> <br />The fifth story, \\"Emily & Jules\\" by Lisa Tucker, is a little weird. I'm not sure I would call it chick lit. Rather than dealing with women'sissues, it's primarily about agoraphobia. Emily and Jules meet online through an agoraphobic group. Then Emily realizes she's not agoraphobic - she can drive around and go outside just fine, no panic attacks - but she feels the need to deceive Jules on this point so he won't feel alone.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is worth checking out if you like chick lit or other Downtown Press books. If you're going to skip any stories, I would skip the second and fifth.	2005-10-07
US	51277244	R1PFYOX78195SG	0345468597	284838546	Mine Are Spectacular!: A Novel	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Light hen lit	I thought from the title of this that it would be about plastic surgery, and I also worried that the co-authors might give the novel a fractured voice. I was wrong on both counts. The \\"Mine are spectacular!\\" reference only pops up once, as an exercise in self-affirmation, and the voice is smooth throughout. Sara does have a friend Kate who's a plastic surgeon, but it's not central to the story. <br /> <br />This is the story of Sara, a 41-year-old divorcee who is navigating her way through middle age in Hadley Farms, a gated community north of New York City - though most of the story takes place in Manhattan. Oddly, Sara's connections with the entertainment world and plastic surgery industry make the setting seem more like L.A. Regis Philbin, Woody Allen, and Billy Crystal all make appearances in the text. <br /> <br />I liked the writing style here, which is full of fun, snappy observations: \\"It used to be that skinny women waltzed through parties nibbling a celery stalk or the occasional carrot stick. Now the bar's higher. To be truly admired, you have to be a size two while still wolfing down everything but the custom drapes.\\" However, others miss the mark: \\"I always think drinking cranberry juice in public takes a brave woman. Either she really can't live without the taste or she has a urinary tract infection.\\" I love cranberry juice, and judging from the popularity of the Cosmo, I'm not alone! <br /> <br />The plot is a little meandering, but it's entertaining as it deals with the sudden reappearance of Sara's ex-husband, who's the father of her child; Kate's affair with a married real estate mogul, who seems to be loosely modeled on Donald Trump; Sara's sometimes rocky relationship with her fianc, Bradford; and Bradford's conniving ex-wife. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this book to fans of light hen lit. It doesn't have much depth, but it's a quick, enjoyable beach read.	2005-09-02
US	51277244	R22DQHFYPG4XB8	1416503218	670063498	Confessions of a Nervous Shiksa	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Not bad	The title of this book was misleading; I thought it would be about a Catholic woman's relationship with a Jewish man and the humorous or bittersweet culture clash. <br /> <br />Instead, Alexis Manning, our protagonist, breaks up with her Jewish boyfriend pretty early into the story. The novel is about how she moves forward from the breakup. The breakup is depicted as a long, gradual process. The author writes, \\"That was the beginning of the end,\\" \\"That was the middle of the end,\\" and \\"That was the end of the end\\" at different  <br />points in the story. <br />  <br />The book suffered from lack of a plot. Nothing much happens, aside from the day-to-day business of Alexis' job as a Hollywood publicist. This seems to consist mostly of reading lists of phone messages and doing damage control when a celebrity does something unsavory. The other plot thread involves Alexis' cat, who is highly susceptible to infections and is always developing boils that need to be lanced. The author makes a clumsy analogy  <br />between Alexis healing from the breakup and the cat healing from all its ailments. <br />  <br />If you're thinking this doesn't sound like a great book, you're right. However, it has its moments. The author clearly knows her movies, and Hollywood PR. And she has a gift for describing characters in a quick, memorable fashion: \\"Sara-Anne said 'Y'all' and 'I'm fixin' to' and had an IQ of 163. She inhaled chitterlings, fudge and foie gras and weighed 105  <br />pounds. When she needed a shower, she said, 'Damn, I am gamey.'\\"  <br /> <br />In short, if you want to read about the life of a Hollywood publicist, or you're going through a breakup, this may be the book for you.	2005-08-21
US	51277244	R1TDXE1YJ7T1PI	141650558X	675859957	Younger	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Excellent, engaging book	I read Pamela Redmond Satran's \\"Babes in Captivity,\\" and enjoyed it, but I thought this was even better. For one thing, the plot was much tighter, and filled with fun twists and surprises. <br /> <br />This is the story of Alice Green, a dowdy, 44-year-old housewife in  suburban Homewood, New Jersey. Alice has always looked young for her age, though she hasn't bothered with her appearance for a long time. She's married to a dentist, who leaves her for his hygienist. Then Alice's daughter leaves for Africa, leaving Alice alone. <br /> <br />In the year following her husband's departure, Alice whips herself into shape by working out for a couple of hours a day. When she tries to re-enter the workforce, she is less successful. She tries to get a job at the publishing house where she worked before she had a child, but they dismiss her as dried-up and middle-aged.  <br /> <br />After Alice tells a gypsy that she wants to be \\"younger,\\" Alice's best friend gives her a makeover. With her gray hair dyed blonde and her newly fit body on display in tighter, more fashionable clothes, Alice decides to give the work thing another try. She returns to Gentility after taking all the dates off her resume and omitting the years she spent as a stay-at-home mom. She also goes to a bar and meets a young man named Josh. <br /> <br />What makes the novel work is not only the riveting plot, but Satran's careful look at the ups and downs of being young and old. She doesn't portray youth as a perfect haven, but instead shows how the \\"young\\" Alice must deal with an overbearing boss who doesn't take her seriously. She shows the pressure that the young women at the publishing company feel to get married and have kids before they're 35.  <br /> <br />Alice's relationship with Josh is a little less plausible. After he sees her naked, he still thinks she's 29, and can't tell that she had a kid! It's hard to believe that after having a child she wouldn't have stretch marks or something.  <br /> <br/>However, Satran follows Alice's deception mostly smoothly from beginning to end, and it makes for very engaging reading.	2005-08-17
US	51277244	R3UPR5JD9KGCR7	1400031087	641692200	A Million Little Pieces	Books	5	2	3	N	N	One of the best books I've read this year	At first I shied away from this book, thinking it would be too depressing. Then I tried it out when I couldn't get through John Irving's new book, and I was riveted right away. <br /> <br />This is a first-person, nonfiction account of James Frey's time in a rehab institution in Minnesota after he got so drunk and high that he fell down a fire escape on his face. It recounts his growing friendship with the other inmates, his stubborn refusal to learn about AA or work the Twelve Steps, his root canals without anesthesia, his forbidden relationship with a girl in rehab, his coming to terms with his parents, and his unstinting look at his own past. It's a no-holds-barred account and it's written beautifully. <br /> <br />I have already put the sequel on hold at the library.	2005-08-15
US	51277244	R1KOCAWNPOWT5O	1573223026	929884077	A Long Way Down	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Not as good as his other books	I have to say I liked High Fidelity and About a Boy much better than this novel. It felt a little bit as if Hornby were going through the motions. He does his usual stream-of-consciousness thing with the characters' internal monologues, but it comes across as each of the characters being much more analytical than they would otherwise seem. <br /> <br />The fracturing of the narrative across four viewpoints was also a problem. The book jacket touted them as \\"four distinct voices,\\" but at first, they really weren't. About halfway through the book, they became distinct. Before that, the changes felt jarring. <br /> <br />Also, I don't think he handled the topic as well as he could have. It came across as kind of glib with a manufactured sunny ending. I don't think it was a realistic depiction of how suicidal people feel, with the possible exception of Martin, who had loads of self-loathing but was not very likable. <br /> <br />That said, if you like Hornby, you should probably read this. Just check it out of the library, as I did, rather than buying it in hardcover. Or wait for the paperback.	2005-08-15
US	51277244	RZDAODU88RBLD	0670034118	289140196	The Wonder Spot	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Enjoyable, though sad	This is another novel-in-stories from Bank, following the life of Sophie Applebaum from age 13 to her 30s or 40s. Her age is not specified in the last story. <br /> <br />The first story tells of Sophie's hatred for and failure in Hebrew school, and the next stories follow a similar pattern: failure in her career as an editorial assistant, her hatred for advertising, failure with men, failure with female friendships, and so forth. <br /> <br />With all this failure, you would expect the story to be pretty depressing, but Bank redeems it with her wry humor. The dialogue is punchy and fun to read. Sophie does undergo growth and change, but somehow it feels forced, as though Bank felt obligated to tack on a happy ending. <br /> <br />I also found the gaps in sequence annoying. For example, Sophie is with one boyfriend for a number of the stories, and then he just disappears. We never find out what happened, because he's simply not mentioned in the next story. <br /> <br />Bank does have a great ability to come up with catchy phrases and one-liners, and the book has an engaging, Judy Blume-esque feel. So if you enjoyed The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing, you will probably enjoy this.	2005-08-13

I've read one other - \\"Ripped at the Seams\\" - and was pleased with that as well. <br /> <br />This is the story of Jo O'Connor, a girl who never gets to stay at the same school for long. She's used to moving several times a year, and the midnight phone calls her father makes just before a move. <br /> <br />Except after they move to Seattle, she wants to stay put. She meets a BMOC named Alex who seems to be interested in her, despite her best efforts to fade into the surroundings (a survival technique for the \\"new kid\\"). It turns out her father witnessed a murder some years ago, is under danger from the murderer, and they HAVE to move. <br /> <br />To fool the murderer, Jo and her father stage their own deaths and she takes on a new identity at a nearby high school.  <br /> <br />The plot thickens when students at her old school see her \\"ghost.\\" Things get out of hand and before she knows it, her \\"ghost\\" has been nominated for the slot of prom queen. <br /> <br />This is a fast-paced, fun read with plenty of plot twists to keep the \\"reluctant reader\\" engaged. I read it in a few hours. I recommend it to anyone who likes a light, original tale.	2005-07-30
US	51277244	R5YHHV9ZSXAAV	0385338686	188590881	The Undomestic Goddess	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Lots of fun	I'm a big fan of the Shopaholic series, and was slightly disappointed by Can You Keep a Secret? I loved this book, however. <br /> <br />Part of the reason may be because I was a lawyer too, in the past, and Kinsella really hits the nail on the head with her description of how awful being a lawyer is.  <br /> <br />Samantha Sweeting is a whip-smart attorney at London's most prestigious firm...until she makes an egregious mistake that loses the firm 50 million pounds. The firm's insurers cover the cost, but one of the partners advises her to stay away while they decide Samantha's fate. She's fired. <br /> <br />Samantha absconds on the train to the English countryside and knocks on the door of a large house, looking for water and aspirin. The lady of the house assumes that Samantha was sent by a housekeeping agency she had called, and the comedy of errors begins. <br /> <br />Like Kinsella's other books, there is a lot of humor (and a little panic) arising from misunderstandings and miscommunications. And deliberate deceptions. Samantha becomes friends with Nathaniel, the gardener, and entrusts him with her secret...that she can't cook or clean. With some domestic training under her belt, she's happy as a housekeeper...until she learns something startling. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this fun, yet meaningful book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Kinsella's other novels.	2005-07-26

However, it was fun. <br /> <br />This is the story of Sophie Katz, a woman who is half-black, half-Jewish. Her skin is the color of a double latte, hence the title. (There's no sex in the book, though there's plenty of murder.) Sophie is a writer of murder mysteries, who gets freaked out when a string of incidents from her novels are re-enacted in her city, San Francisco. <br /> <br />The author does a good job bringing out a parade of possible suspects, and no, I didn't guess who the killer was, though I'm new to mysteries, so it may be easy for others to figure it out. The dialogue is snappy and the plot is pretty engaging.  <br /> <br />All in all, this was an interesting, fun mystery with some memorable, freaky characters (including a lad who wants to be a vampire).	2005-07-25

In fact, it may have surpassed the prequel. <br /> <br />Something Blue picks up where Something Borrowed left off. Darcy has discovered her best friend and her fiance together, and storms off in a huff. When her relationship with her ex-fiance's roommate peters out, she finds herself pregnant and alone, with no real friends. <br /> <br />Determined to make a fresh start, Darcy cajoles Ethan (her fifth-grade boyfriend) into letting her stay with him in London. He is reluctant, but agrees. <br /> <br />What follows is a personal journey, bumpy and engaging, as Darcy evolves from an extremely self-centered person into someone who can take part in a real relationship. The book, like its predecessor, is deeper than the pink and blue covers imply. <br /> <br />Strongly recommended.	2005-07-19

It's told entirely in the format of instant messages. <br /> <br />Even though I graduated high school 12 years ago (eek!) and have never instant-messaged (I prefer email), I totally related to this story. The three girls are Maddie, who's kind of a rebel; Zoe, a \\"people-pleasing straight-A student\\"; and Angela, a flower-child romantic. <br /> <br />The fluctuations and in-fights in the girls' relationship are very real, as is the affection they show for each other. Their travails with boys are lovingly detailed. Angela has to get over a boy who cruelly dumps her, while Maddie is rejected by a \\"popular\\" friend outside their circle. Zoe has to fend off a young teacher's advances, but she likes him back...or does she? <br /> <br />Read TTYL, you won't regret it.	2005-07-15
US	51277244	R1LJEXJX3IIMD9	0425202631	780805589	The Yoga Mamas	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Fun, frothy read	Since I'm a yoga fan living in New York, this book was an obvious choice for me. But I'm confident that most chick lit fans would enjoy it.  <br /> <br />The main characters are Lisa (our narrator), Isla (a six-foot-tall Spanish model), Susan (the gentle, spacey wife of a wealthy Wall Street businessman), Gigi (the tough-talking Queens native) and Margaret (a humorless lawyer). I liked Margaret the least, until she started showing her soft side. All the other characters are enjoyable and interesting. <br /> <br />They might seem to have nothing in common, but they're all pregnant and all enrolled in yoga class at Hasharama, a trendy (fictitious) SoHo studio. Each woman has a secret, except the narrator.  <br /> <br />This is a fun read about the ups and downs of pregnancy, raising a baby, immersing yourself in yoga, friendship and men. The plot stretches credulity toward the end (I won't spoil the surprise) but this bubbly, crisply-written book is the perfect summer read.	2005-07-05
US	51277244	R3Q7BYI7X4BONY	0316776963	491689172	Me Talk Pretty One Day	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A little disappointed	Before I read this book, I read \\"Naked\\" and \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,\\" also by David Sedaris. I liked those much better. <br /> <br />\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" often seems forced, with situations that fall flat on their face - Sedaris watching young men get injured by angry cows, Sedaris watching a girl almost fall off a halted amusement park ride, Sedaris flubbing an IQ test in French, etc. The opening essay, about seeing a speech therapist in high school and Sedaris's ability to avoid the letter s (which would reveal his lisp), isn't very funny.  <br /> <br />Also, oddly, the book reads as a tribute to Sedaris's father, which is strange considering Sedaris's light mockery of him in other books. \\"Naked\\" is more of a tribute to Sedaris's mother, and that felt more natural somehow. I know from his other books that there was a lot of tension between Sedaris and his father on account of Sedaris's sexuality, and that tension seemed to be missing between Sedaris and his mother. <br /> <br />The book also suffers from a dearth of Paul, Sedaris's funniest sibling in my opinion. \\"Corduroy and Denim\\" features lots of Paul and is all the better for it. <br /> <br />Probably the best essay in the book is the one based on the title, which documents Sedaris's struggle to learn French. He can't keep track of which nouns are masculine and which are feminine, and he recounts the butchered language in which he and his classmates comfort each other. Touching and funny at the same time. An essay about his sister Amy and how she wears the lower half of a \\"fat suit\\" home for the holidays is also very funny.	2005-07-04

Her life is planned out to the millisecond. <br /> <br />Enter sexy James from Common Grounds, the coffee shop where she works, and her niece, V...who's only a year younger than Mara is. (Mara has a much older sister.) Mara's sister jets off to Costa Rica, forcing V to stay with Mara and her parents. <br /> <br />During this time, Mara's life is turned upside down, forcing her to reexamine her priorities. <br /> <br />The plot line is somewhat predictable, as some of the other reviewers said. However, Mackler's writing is so strong and her dialogue so lively, and her characters so engaging, that a little predictability doesn't hurt the story much.	2005-07-03

I enjoyed the character of Steve very much (he changes his name to Danny so he doesn't have so much to live up to). The male point of view is convincing and his friends and bandmates, Vince and Matty, are vividly drawn. <br /> <br />The plot revolves around Danny's girlfriend's ultimatum. It's not quite as described on the back cover. Instead of saying she'll dump him if he doesn't break into the music scene in the next 6 months, she says, \\"I want you to have a real job or a record contract in the next 6 months. Otherwise, we'll see.\\" <br /> <br />Danny's girlfriend is a real pill, and the way she's described as a complete beauty goddess will not endear her to female readers. When he does well at a gig, she tells him he wasn't that good and his record contract won't come to anything anyway. Why does he stay with her, and let her run his life??? <br /> <br />The girlfriend was a real deal-breaker for me. I kept hoping they would break up. <br /> <br />Aside from that, the book was humorously written and I enjoyed it.	2005-07-02

Readers will relate to Sammie, the story's likable, hippie protagonist. Sammie finds herself having to be mature and strong when her father and her mother separate and she follows her mother, who is an emotional wreck, from Ithaca, NY to Manhattan. <br /> <br />The story tracks the changes in Sammie's life over the course of a summer in the city. She makes new friends, gets to know a boy she's attracted to, and gradually makes her peace with her mother. <br /> <br />There are no big, dramatic plot developments here, just an authentic voice, likable characters and Mackler's sure way with words. The dialogue is especially good and true-to-life.	2005-06-30

Both feature sweet, self-doubting protagonists and crisp writing. <br /> <br />In The Frog Prince, Holly Bishop finds herself abandoned by Jean-Marc, her husband who told her on their honeymoon that he didn't love her. He files for divorce. She moves to San Francisco to start a new life as an event planner, but it isn't easy for her to make friends, until her mother forces her hand. Her co-workers force her to start dating again, which is disastrous at first. <br /> <br />Holly also works with a real witch who ends up teaching her to do \\"what's right.\\" There is no moralizing, however. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book a lot. Perhaps it is on the simplistic side, but I found that it was written from the heart, and the prose moved at a refreshing clip. Again, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Alison Pace's book, or anyone who likes quirky tales, or anyone who likes San Francisco.	2005-06-26
US	51277244	R2Q8JA5JCV8TJJ	1594480419	792196957	Someone I Loved (Je l'aimais) (English and French Edition)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Beautifully written, unsatisfying ending	This is the story of a woman who's just been abandoned by her husband, and you think it will be about that betrayal, but no. She ends up taking a trip with her father-in-law and her own daughter (who is young, and only appears once or twice) and they have a long, fascinating conversation about all the father-in-law's buried emotion for a woman he fell in love with while he was married to someone else. <br /> <br />The book is mostly dialogue, without tags, which sometimes bothers me, but didn't here. I loved Gavalda's short story collection, \\"I Wish Someone Were Waiting For Me Somewhere,\\" and this novel displays the same gifts. She cuts to the emotional heart of the matter without sentimentality, and paints beautiful word-pictures. <br /> <br />That said, I thought the book ended on a flat note. After thinking about it, I knew what Gavalda was trying to express, but it just wasn't satisfying. It didn't resolve anything and it didn't make as vivid an impression as the other images and emotions in the book.  <br /> <br />Still, it is worth reading, especially if you liked her short-story collection.	2005-06-22

This leaves Georgia on the \\"rack of love,\\" but she's not sad for long because the Stiff Dylans have found a new head singer to replace Robbie. His name is Masimo and all the girls in town have a crush on him, including Wet Lindsay, Georgia's rival from the past. Georgia also seeks advice from her mate Dave (self-avowed  \\"Horn Master\\") on how to get Masimo's attention. Although it's hard, when she's trying to keep her new kitten in line and keep her little sister from putting a dress on her Jesus figure... <br /> <br />This book has the same zany humor, Georgia-isms and hilarious perspective on adolescence as the earlier books. The boys are getting a little more pushy for sex, which seems more realistic (the ones in the earlier books seemed content with kissing all the time). Georgia's take on books such as Heidi and Wuthering Heights (aka \\"Blithering Heights\\") is really funny. She also delves into her father's James Bond book and her mother's \\"How to Make Any Man Fall in Love with You,\\" with hilarious results. <br /> <br />Good for at least one laugh out loud. I can't wait to read the next one.	2005-06-22

She and her husband have not had sex in ages. He criticizes her for being disorganized, not preparing dinner, etc. and starts spending more and more time at the office, where he is working on a drug called \\"Biosensual.\\" It has similar effects as Viagra, can be taken by men and women, but if you take a few milligrams too much, you lose all higher brain function. Delilah inadvertently sends her husband's notes on the drug to the TV studio she writes soap opera scripts for. They love it and incorporate it into their plot line.  <br /> <br />Suddenly, cars are trying to run Del over, bricks fall off of buildings and almost hit her on the head, and she learns that a list of people want her dead. <br /> <br />Without giving away too much of the plot, the story is completely implausible. Every character, including the blond-wigged Orthodox Jewish woman upstairs, the plumber, and Del's husband, has a huge secret concerning his or her identity. All these enormous secrets strain credibility. Although Kwitney avoids the cliches of the bored-housewife genre, she goes overboard and makes the story so removed from the ordinary that it's unbelievable. <br /> <br />That said, Kwitney has created a likable, smart and quirky protagonist. Delilah is a great character; you care about what happens to her. The day-to-day details of her life with her daughter, Sadie, are recounted convincingly. Kwitney also has a nice touch with setting. <br /> <br />If you like Kwitney's other books, you may want to read this one, but keep your expectations low on the plausibility front. I still think her best book is \\"The Dominant Blonde.\\"	2005-06-21

At her therapist's request, Emily recalls each of her boyfriends starting in her twenties, and works her way up to the present. Dr. D, her therapist, tells her to come up with ten reasons she shouldn't date each man. <br /> <br />A chapter is given to each boyfriend, except for one man who gets two chapters; and each chapter is interspersed with reasons (Reason #1, Reason #2, and so forth). Therefore, you already know the relationships aren't going to work, so there isn't much in the way of suspense or dramatic tension to propel the narrative. <br /> <br />What does keep the novel going? Gerlach has a fresh and funny, though not sophisticated voice, occasionally marred by lapses in grammar. The most compelling of the boyfriends is Reese, a pro baseball player who worms his way under Emily's skin, and \\"pushes all her little girl buttons,\\" says her therapist. Most female readers will relate to the way Emily falls in love with the idea of Reese, and how when he pushes her away, not knowing what he's thinking \\"drives her batty.\\" She even hires a PI to find out if he's cheating, only to find that he's eating pizza and watching Caddyshack alone. Hence, the guy she's obsessed with is not even that interesting. <br /> <br />Overall, the occasional nugget of insight, and the snappy prose, make this book worth reading.	2005-06-20
US	51277244	RCF1BV41VJXT3	0316777730	1192464	Naked	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Witty and entertaining	The first two essays in this book are awful - skip 'em! - but after that the book made me laugh out loud several times. Sedaris' personality - jagged around the edges, unabashedly self-centered, and intellectually snobby yet winning in its intelligence - pervades the collection. <br /> <br />Some of the highlights: In \\"The Incomplete Quad,\\" Sedaris recalls how he thought his first college, a state school in North Carolina, was a government experiment to monitor the effects of loud Pink Floyd songs on a group of students who think they can drive to Europe. He transferred to Kent State despite the shootings; \\"at least they weren't dying of boredom,\\" he says. At Kent State, the state would pay your tuition if you lived with a quadriplegic, so he set his quadriplegic roommate on the toilet, clipped his toenails, etc. He also forged a friendship with an \\"incomplete quad\\" named Peg, and the ending of this essay is unexpectedly poignant. <br /> <br />In \\"C.O.G.,\\" he is also hilarious when recounting his experiences at low-level jobs: apple picking, making jade clocks and boxes, and paint stripping for a bigoted woman and a crafty African-American man.   <br /> <br />The last story in the collection, \\"Naked,\\" discusses his stint in a nudist colony: the insistence that you bring your own towels, the fact that most nudists are the last people you'd want to see naked, etc. <br /> <br />One chilling essay is about hitchhiking and the insane people who picked him up. One of them made Sedaris wash his car so he could see what it was like to be a \\"giver.\\" <br /> <br />One of the essays touches upon his Greek grandmother, who called Sedaris' mother \\"the girl\\" and how she ended up in a nursing home with a surly roommate all the children loved. <br /> <br />Funny as the essays are, they have dark or serious undertones. It's as if Sedaris is adept at seeing the humorous surfaces of life, but also the depth below.	2005-06-18

Daniel is away skiing, and Billy is using his apartment while he does IRS investigations on a woman in the same building. Billy and Nina meet cute when he startles her in the bathtub, and they keep running into each other afterward. It must mean something! (If the plot already strikes you as hokey, read no further). <br /> <br />I think this book works best for people who are uncynical and love dogs. The dogs in the book are better developed than most of the characters, with the exception of the woman (Constance Chandler) who is under investigation by the IRS. Surprisingly, she is one of the most interesting characters, though she is peripheral to the plot. <br /> <br />Anyone could predict how this book will end. The real fun to be had here is in the dogs' company and their quirks. For example, Nina has to make sure certain dogs walk next to each other when she hits the streets with her charges. Otherwise there is havoc.  <br /> <br />Schnur is not an especially skilled writer; the dialogue is usually not witty, so it strikes a false note when the characters laugh at the \\"jokes.\\" Most of the characters are flat enough to be summarized in a sentence (Daniel, ladies' man; Billy, insecure   brother; etc.) Again, this is best recommended to people who like dogs and very light reads.	2005-06-18
US	51277244	R11B16OVPTZZ8K	0060083298	429568377	Dominant Blonde, The	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good book, but too much violence	As a brunette, I was turned off by the title. I pictured one of those smug blondes who thinks she's got it going on. Well, the title is misleading. The protagonist of \\"The Dominant Blonde\\" is a person others think is weak, someone who is trying to figure out  <br />her life. She's easy to root for because she goes into everything with an open heart, and you want things to work out for her. <br /> <br />This is the story of how Lydia, our protagonist, goes to the Caribbean with her boyfriend, Abe. This time, she tells herself, she's finally with someone who likes her more than she likes him. She's down two dress sizes and ready to take on the world. Only, Abe disappears in a diving incident, and $3 million disappears from her father's business account at the same time.   <br /> <br />To the rescue: Liam, an Irish diving guide and ladies' man. He and Lydia embark on a steamy romance with many plot-enhancing but  mostly believable setbacks. The secondary characters are Fish, Liam's business partner, and Martin, a cool, clipped British type who owns most of the island's diving boats. There is also Kira, Abe's \\"sister\\", and a Russian mobster, both of whom want to get their hands on the ring Abe bought with the stolen money. <br /> <br />I loved the humor in this book, and thought the writing style was more sophisticated than the title and cover imply. This is not a silly book about being blonde. However, the Russian mobster  is way too violent. His behavior leaves the reader with a bad taste in her mouth after an otherwise pleasant, enjoyable caper.	2005-06-16
US	51277244	R1J5L7DR38N54M	0060586125	54425207	Three Wishes	Books	4	7	10	N	N	Good book, disappointing ending	This book starts with a scene where 3 triplets are eating birthday cake in a restaurant. One of the women is pregnant and the other throws a fork at her stomach. The scene is told from a bystander's point of view so we don't know the sisters by name yet. The novel then works backward so we can see how they got to this point. <br /> <br />For me, the middle of the book was best, because it focused on Gemma's story. Gemma is the flaky, endearing, yet smart sister who is scarred by a past relationship. Her fiance died, but no one in her family knew that he was abusive. Because of his behavior, she finds herself bowing out of relationships if the new boyfriend reminds her of the fiance even slightly. For example, one of them asks her to wash the sand from her feet at the beach before getting in the car, and this reminds her of her fiance's wrath when she got sand in his car, so she breaks up with the boyfriend. Gemma is a charming, troubled person and you root for her to conquer her troubles. <br /> <br />One of the other sisters, Cat, is harder to care about. Cat is one of the glass-half-empty people with an enormous sense of entitlement and an equally marked lack of empathy. She feels like she deserves everything in life and takes it out on others when things go wrong. Unfortunately, the last part of the book focuses on Cat. <br /> <br />The third sister, Lyn, is not as well-drawn as the other two. She's a workaholic who has trouble delegating, and her husband presses her to get an assistant to help her with her on-the-go breakfast business (Brekkie Bus). <br /> <br />I also had trouble with something that happened to the girls' grandmother near the end. It seemed completely unnecessary and irrelevant to the plot, on top of being disturbing.  <br /> <br />Overall, Moriarty's breezy and clever style, as well as her way with dialogue, makes this book worth reading. But I do wish she had chosen to keep the focus on Gemma and given the grandmother a break.	2005-06-15

I loved it. It's the story of Georgia Nicolson, a snarky but endearing 14-year-old Brit, and her friends.  <br /> <br />The plot revolves around Georgia's attempts to snare Robbie, lead singer of the Stiff Dylans and bona fide \\"Sex God\\". However, Robbie is 17 and not thrilled that Georgia is 3 years younger. Meanwhile, Georgia contends with \\"whelk boy,\\" who gives her sloppy kisses; her 2-year-old sister Libby, who insists on crawling into Georgia's bed at night and brings her Scuba-Diving Barbie along; and her father's sudden departure to New Zealand in search of a job. <br /> <br />Part of what makes the book so memorable is Georgia's unique vocabulary. She has a nickname for everything: blodge for biology, Froggers for French, nuddy-pants (translation: going without underwear). A truly enjoyable read. I recommend the sequels as well.	2005-06-12

In this community, any Jew who has improper relations with a Gentile, business or otherwise, may find himself called before the Ma'amad, a council with the power to excommunicate. <br /> <br />The characters are linked together in webs: Miguel lives in his brother Daniel's basement, but there's no love lost between them. Daniel's pregnant wife, Hannah, has a crush on Miguel. Miguel is sleeping with their servant girl, Annetje, who has a streak of cruelty. When the novel begins, Miguel is entering into the coffee business with Gertruid, a shrewd and comely widow.  <br /> <br />As the novel progresses, Miguel suspects that Parido, a member of the Ma'amad, is out to get him because of Miguel's former, unhappily ended involvement with Parido's daughter. Miguel is also hounded by Joachim, a beggar who feels that Miguel has done him wrong. Rounding out the cast of schemers is Hendricks, Gertruid's personal servant, who will beat up anyone for a fee.  <br /> <br />The novel is extremely plot-driven, although Hannah and Miguel are well-developed. Some of the twists and turns are not believable; Joachim, for example, undergoes a drastic transformation. <br /> <br />The end of the book is haunting, with a final twist. The author seems to be making the point that what goes around, comes around;  Miguel suffers the blows of a karmic payback. I would have preferred if the ending was entirely happy, but perhaps the book is more resonant this way. <br /> <br />If you don't generally like historical novels because the language can be stiff and pompous, try this one anyway. The dialogue is clear and not ornate, and Liss's prose is extremely concise.	2005-06-05

I think it is a pity she is not more well-known because I really enjoyed her stories. Taken together, her stories have a breathless, colloquial quality that makes you feel like a friend is talking to you. Most of the stories have a fun, quirky premise, but without being shallow, and her observations are very funny. <br /> <br />Highlights for me were:  <br /> <br />The Super Fantastic New Zealand Triangle: this story is about a woman who constructs an elaborate fantasy about an actor living in New Zealand and their relationship. <br /> <br />Josie and Hyman Differ in Their Use of the Word F***: This is the story of a young woman who dates an older man who doesn't take her seriously because she's beautiful. He's obsessed with his SAT scores and likes to act edgy. <br /> <br />Year-at-a-Glance: This story is a kind of log kept by a woman whose mother died, and tracks the woman's grieving process over a year. <br /> <br />The Daves: One of the best stories in the collection. The protagonist keeps meeting men named Dave, even if they claim to be named something else, and she finds out that all women (even herself) are named Jennifer. Interesting musings on whether everyone is alike or not. <br /> <br />Christina: This is about a woman whose apartment is haunted by the ghost of a baby. They become good friends and dance together, and the baby imparts wisdom to her about how she isn't different from everybody else (though she feels that she is). <br /> <br />An Intervention: This is a story about a woman who joins AA even though she isn't an alcoholic, because it makes her feel \\"a part of\\" (AA-speak for a sense of belonging). <br /> <br />Good For You!: This is about a woman who sends out a holiday card with a picture of herself and gets some unexpected responses. <br /> <br />All in all, these were very creative, well-written stories that were fun to read and illuminating as well. Recommended.	2005-06-03

She has trouble juggling all these people, all of whom appeal to a different side of her. She's protective of Joel, an androgynous would-be dancer; feels sorry for Jonny, a once-pretty boy who lost his looks in a motorcycle accident; loves solid Richard's little girl, Dotty; is amused by Stef, but worried about his con schemes; and is attracted to Amy and the novelty of a relationship with a woman.  <br /> <br />The story traces the arc of each of these relationships. When Kathryn gets to know one of her fares, a guy named Craig Summer, each of her other relationships is affected in unexpected ways.  <br /> <br />Kathryn is an interesting though hard-nosed character, and the book subtly explains why she is the way she is. What makes the book interesting is the dynamic plot (something intriguing is always happening) and the memorable cast of characters. Rounding out the group is Winnie, a taxi driver who gives Kathryn \\"bits of wisdom.\\"  <br /> <br />One drawback of the book is the way the author switches quickly and without warning from one scene to another. It can leave the reader feeling disoriented.  <br /> <br />Also, the book is a bit darker than most chick lit, although it is marketed as such. Some of the chracters have real problems, which means it is not entirely a light, fluffy read.	2005-05-31

Here are my favorite stories from \\"In One Year and Out the Other\\", in no particular order: <br /> <br />Beth Kendrick, \\"The Bad Breakup Regime\\": This is a fun story about  a man and a woman who seclude themselves and eat Doritos while watching bad television, after the woman's boyfriend leaves her for the man's girlfriend. After sulking for a few months, they whip themselves into the best shape possible so they can hold their heads high at the company New Year's Eve party. Both women work there and all four of the main characters show up at the party, with some surprising results.  <br /> <br />Cara Lockwood, \\"Resolved: A New Year's Resolution List\\": this story is about Megan, who was dating a married man until recently, and has now drawn up a 600-item resolution list to \\"improve herself.\\" This story has surprising emotional depth, but is still funny, as Megan deals with group therapy (\\"this is a safe space\\") and new love. <br /> <br />Pamela Redmond Satran, \\"How To Start the New Year Like a Guy\\": this is about a married woman who decides to act more like a guy in a number of ways. Maybe not surprisingly, she gets her husband to act more like a girl. <br /> <br />Diane Stingley, \\"Expecting a Call\\": this was a good story about a  woman who's waiting to hear from a guy who got her number at a party. He never calls, but the woman does receive visits from 3 ghosts who give her surprising insight into herself. Sort of a modern-day Scrooge tale about New Year's Eve instead of Christmas.	2005-05-24

There's Genevieve, a girl from a trashy town in Alabama who's remade herself into a hotshot Ph.D. who complains when hotels aren't up to her standards; her husband, who feels inadequate because she's frigid; and Genevieve's younger, uninhibited sister, Kenya. When the husband accompanies Genevieve to her hometown for a funeral, he learns a whole lot about what she came from, and falls under Kenya's spell. <br /> <br />Parts of the book were unbelievable - how could a wife hide so much from her husband? would he really dive into an affair with his wife's sister just like that? - but EJD works his usual magic with vivid descriptions and compelling characters. Another page-turner.	2005-05-24

And it was honest about being nonfiction. <br /> <br />\\"Notes From the Underbelly\\" is the story of a woman who is a college admissions counselor at a private school, was a corporate finance attorney before that, attended U Penn, has a dog and is pregnant. The author was a college admissions counselor, a corporate finance attorney before that, attended U Penn, has a dog and 2 children. <br /> <br />Like Rebecca Eckler, the protagonist in this novel chooses to have a C-section, has a hard time seeing the sex of her baby at first because the baby holds its legs together during the ultrasound, and so forth. <br /> <br />The difference? The heroine in this book is not really likable. She has two friends, a hyper-driven entertainment lawyer with no sense of humor and a chip on her shoulder the size of California, and a perky, materialistic stay-at-home mom. The book is divided about evenly between the protagonist's job and the protagonist complaining about her friends or being pregnant. <br /> <br />The book was good on a plot level - you wanted to know if the protagonist's charges at school would get into their top colleges, and how the pregnancy would go - but I found it hard to like or care about the characters. The ending of the novel just kind of fizzled out without any major character transformation or insight of any kind.  <br /> <br />But if you like reading about selfish, shallow people who occasionally make funny jokes, you might like this book.	2005-05-23

It begins with fifteen-year-old Sara's trip to the hospital to deliver her illegitimate baby. Sara arranges an open adoption with an older couple named Eva and George. Open adoption means they can visit each other as often as they want, but it's enforceable only in Oregon, and the adoption is arranged in Massachusetts. <br /> <br />After the baby is born, Eva and George are less interested in seeing Sara and they start to push her away, discouraging her from visiting their house, even though they said before, \\"Our house is your house.\\" \\"That was never really true,\\" George comments after the baby is born. And after Sara tries to kidnap the baby, heading to Omaha on a Greyhound bus, Eva and George get a restraining order and eventually skip town.  <br /> <br />The story is told from the point of view of all the key players: Sara, her child Anne, Anne's father Danny, Eva, and George. It is especially satisfying because you get to see the story unfold over many years. The author traces the long-term effects of the adoption on everyone. When Sara finally tracks down Anne in her new home of Boca Raton, it's hard to put the book down.	2005-05-20

For some reason, I always like heroines without self-confidence. You root for them, and want them to succeed. <br /> <br />Anna is the \\"dogsbody\\" for Kitty, a \\"wasp-waisted woman of a certain age, with a great plastic surgeon, so no one can tell what that age is\\". Anna's responsible for finding scripts. When Anna does spot a great one, Kitty takes the credit - but Anna catches the eye of Mark Swan, a (fictitious) big-deal UK director. He insists on working with her instead of the other people at Winning Productions. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Anna is reluctantly pulled into a romance with Charles, a member of the landed gentry. Anna's friend fixed them up. While Anna is not attracted to him, and he \\"doesn't fancy her\\", they do forge a friendship of sorts, and he supports her in her dream of screenwriting. Meanwhile, Mark insists that she rewrite the script she's been working on, and stops pulling strings for her.  <br /> <br />The subplot involves Anna's two model flatmates - one a young blonde, the other a 28-year-old brunette who is being forced into catalogue work because of her \\"old age.\\" The blonde is rather one-note, but the brunette and Anna become friends, and Anna does her an enormous favor in the end. <br /> <br />One note: the plot description on the back of the book promises a \\"madcap scheme\\" whereby Anna gets what she wants, but there really was no such scheme - on behalf of herself, anyway. I found Anna to be a genuine, kind, funny character. She made the 372 pages worth reading. And yes, she gets some confidence by the end.	2005-05-18

Berg brings her usual sensitivity and insight to exploring a number of interesting situations. Berg's writing is lucid, readable and highly enjoyable. <br /> <br />In \\"Ordinary Life: A Love Story,\\" Berg writes about Mavis, a wife in her seventies who locks herself in the bathroom for a few days, as a way of coping with changes in her life.  <br /> <br />\\"Departure from Normal\\" is the story of a woman and her pet parrot. Both have cancer. <br /> <br />\\"Things We Used to Believe\\" is about a man and a woman who have an almost-affair. <br /> <br />\\"Caretaking,\\" told partly in the past and then in the present, is about a woman whose mother has Alzheimer's. <br /> <br />\\"Sweet Refuge,\\" one of the most powerful stories in the collection, is about a nurse who willingly seeks out the most difficult terminal patients, and the rewards and complications of her behavior. <br /> <br />\\"Take This Quiz\\" is about a wife enamored of magazine quizzes who tries to get her husband to open up. <br /> <br />\\"Martin's Letter to Nan\\" is a husband's letter to his wife who just ran away.  <br /> <br />\\"What Stays,\\" one of my favorites, is about a little girl with a vivacious and unusual mother. <br /> <br />\\"White Dwarf,\\" my least favorite, is about a woman who has had an affair because her husband won't talk to her. They address the affair indirectly, while driving in their car. <br /> <br />\\"The Matchmaker\\" is a fun story about an eleven-year-old who tries to fix up a German woman with a widower in her neighborhood. She gives English lessons to the woman.  <br /> <br />\\"One Time at Christmas, in My Sister's Bathroom\\" is about a woman coming to terms with her difficult father at a family gathering. This one will resonate with anyone who has a difficult in-law or relative. <br /> <br />\\"Regrets Only\\" is a fun, quirky story about a married woman and her gay male friend. <br /> <br />\\"The Thief\\" is an unusual and interesting story about a man who intends to steal valuables from a woman's house. <br /> <br />\\"Today's Special\\" is kind of an undeveloped story about eating in a diner and what it can do for you. I wasn't surprised to find that it was one of Berg's earliest stories, because it wasn't up to the level of the other tales. <br /> <br />Overall, though, this was one of the best short story collections I've ever read. I loved all but two of the stories. Highly recommended.	2005-05-11

Which is perhaps to be expected, because she started out by writing essays and articles for women's magazines. <br /> <br />Throughout the guide, Berg dispenses many tips, such as: show a man is old by describing the dime-size age spots, rather than saying he's old; mood can be reflected in description; go to a restaurant and write down everything someone does for 10 minutes; crash someone's funeral, if there's a tasteful way to do it; and keep it simple when sending query letters to agents (i.e., no perfumed paper or candy boxes).  <br /> <br />She also includes interesting tidbits such as a discussion on how to deal with success, and the envy one's friends might begin to harbor. Her friend Phyllis contributed 5 pages to the book concerning the jealousy she felt when Berg made it to the New York Times bestseller list. She also includes tips on how to handle rejection (in the scheme of things, it's not a big deal) and choose a writing class (be wary of teachers who don't write). <br /> <br />Perhaps most valuable are the thirty pages of writing exercises, intended to unleash your creativity. She goes for variety, breadth and depth by giving you sentences to complete, scenes to write, and gender-bending exercises (for example, if you're a woman, write about what it feels like to find out you impregnated someone).  <br /> <br />Another great thing about the book is how encouraging she is. She devotes a whole chapter to debunking myths about writing, and insists that she started out without contacts or an agent.  <br /> <br />Definitely worth your time if you're at all interested in writing.	2005-05-11
US	51277244	R1VBQR778GVENG	0452285895	310377016	The Wives of Bath	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Just OK	I really enjoyed Wendy Holden's first three books (Simply Divine, Bad Heir Day, and Farm Fatale) for their witty language and sharp plot twists, but I couldn't get into Azur Like It. The Wives of Bath, while readable, does not measure up to Holden's earlier works. <br /> <br />It feels as if Holden is going through the motions here. This is the story of two couples who each have a baby: Alice, a downtrodden lawyer, and Jake, her environmentalist husband; Hugo, a dashing real estate agent, and his domineering wife, Amanda. The two couples are part of the same prenatal class at the hospital.  <br /> <br />Hugo and Alice are well-developed as characters, but their spouses are empty types. Jake is obsessed with recycling, to the point that he gets all his clothes from the local dump, uses colanders for lamp shades and \\"loos\\" for garden planters. Amanda is a self-obsessed \\"career woman\\" who complains about balancing her work life and home life, although Hugo is the only one who takes care of their baby.  <br /> <br />The ending is completely predictable. A four-year-old could correctly forecast which two people will end up together. <br /> <br />Holden does make some observations about the difficulty a man has raising a child alone, in terms of juggling work, daycare and social expectations, but that's really nothing new...the subject was addressed in the movie \\"Mr. Mom\\" back in the '80s. <br /> <br />	2005-05-07
US	51277244	R2F790JI4VNUM3	0743499425	464986154	Dixieland Sushi	Books	4	11	12	N	N	I loved this book	While \\"Dixieland Sushi\\" is not deep or serious, I really enjoyed it and thought it explored some issues that are not typically touched upon in chick lit. <br /> <br />The story follows 28-year-old Jen, the child of a Japanese woman and an blond Arkansan nicknamed Bubba who has a \\"room of death\\" filled with fish that he caught, etc. One of the fish is called \\"Bud\\" because he caught it with a can of beer.   <br /> <br />Jen's beauty-queen cousin, Lucy (on the Caucasian side of the family) is marrying Jen's childhood crush. The story is told through a series of flashbacks that bring the reader back to the roller-skating birthday parties and Valentine's Day in the classroom of Jen's childhood, when she carefully selected a Garfield valentine for her crush, only to watch him throw it away. <br /> <br />Back in the present, Jen has a demanding job as a TV producer with an irascible boss and crazy news anchors whom she has to keep in line. The irrepressible Riley, a British co-worker whom she thinks of as \\"Colins\\" (because of his resemblance to both Colin Farrell and Colin Firth), is a great love interest. But when Jen sees her crush again, what will happen? <br /> <br />I thought this story was great because it was laugh-out-loud funny and also delved into growing up in the '80s in Arkansas as a biracial teenager. Identity issues continue to rear their head even when Jen is an adult. For example, one guy with whom she had no sparks is suddenly interested in another date when he finds out she's half-Japanese. She concludes he has the AO blood type (Asian Obsessed). <br /> <br />Definitely worth reading.	2005-05-05

He examines the influence of incentive, heredity, the neighborhood you grew up in, etc. <br /> <br />Some of his conclusions are less than earth-shattering. For example, African-American names (DeShawn, Latanya) don't influence African-American test performance. As a second example, Levitt compiled data regarding online dating websites and concluded that bald men and overweight women fared badly. Not rocket science. <br /> <br />However, Levitt livens up the book with some controversial discussions. He believes that the dramatic drop in crime in the 1990s can be traced to Roe v. Wade. He thinks that the children who would have committed crimes (due to being brought up by impoverished, teenage, single mothers) are simply not being born as often. <br /> <br />He also writes about the man who more or less singlehandedly contributed to the KKK's demise by infiltrating their group and leaking their secret passwords and rituals to the people behind the Superman comic book (Superman needed a new enemy).  <br /> <br />Interestingly, he also discusses how overbearing parents don't contribute to a child's success. For example, having a lot of books in the house has a positive influence on children's test scores, but reading to a child a lot has no effect. Highly educated parents are also a plus, while limiting children's television time is irrelevant. Similarly, political candidates who have a lot of money to finance their campaigns are still out of luck if no one likes them. <br /> <br />In the chapter entitled \\"Why Drug Dealers Live With Their Mothers,\\" Levitt explores the economics of drug dealing. An Indian, Harvard-affiliated scholar decided to get up close and personal with crack gangs and got some notebooks documenting their finances. Levitt concludes that drug dealers' empires are a lot like McDonald's or the publishing industry in Manhattan - only the people on the very top of the pyramid do well financially, while the burger flippers, editorial assistants, and low-level drug runners don't (indeed, some of them work for free, or in return for protection!) <br /> <br />Overall, this is a lively read, with some obvious conclusions and some not so obvious.	2005-04-30

Both novels are about a woman who starts a new life after losing her husband, but \\"Open House\\" was about divorce and \\"Pleasures\\" is about being a widow. <br /> <br />Financially comfortable Betta Nolan (her parents couldn't decide between \\"Betty\\" and \\"Anna\\") sells her Beacon Hill townhouse for $9 million and decides to buy a house in the midwest, not too far from Chicago. She immediately falls in with an intriguing cast of characters - the boy next door who is ten and leaves a written note volunteering to do chores for her; the chatty real estate agent who is also a widow; an offbeat radio show host; a sort-of boyfriend; and a young man in his twenties who rents her a room in his place when she can't sleep at night. The young man has a male Brazilian roommate, Jovani, who says many truly hilarious and also endearing things. When he and Betta watch Friends reruns, Jovani says, \\"This is us, Betta.\\" <br /> <br />Although the plot is loosely structured, I thought it was cohesive because there was a unifying thread: a woman learning how to approach life in a new way and deal with the curveballs that were thrown at her. Overall, I liked it much better than \\"The Art of Mending\\" and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed \\"Open House.\\"	2005-04-30
US	51277244	RAFE2ZNE1INDK	1400042267	59870239	Lost in the Forest	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Interesting characters, intelligent writing	This is the story of Eva, her ex-husband Mark, and their daughter Daisy. (They have another daughter, Emily, but her point of view is never explored.) The story starts when Eva's new husband, John, is killed in a car accident as he's walking.  <br /> <br />We learn that Mark is still in love with Eva, while Eva is still stung by his betrayal (an affair during their marriage), and Daisy is resentful of her petite, popular sister. Then Daisy puts on a dominatrix outfit at a charades party and catches the eye of her mother's friend's creepy husband.  <br /> <br />The main characters here are spectacular. Miller plumbs their inner depths, so you feel like you know them and their innermost desires. The supporting characters (big, blowzy Gracie and her limping, somewhat sinister husband, Duncan, as well as Eva and John's toddler son, Theo) are also memorable. <br /> <br />Miller's writing has its usual intelligence. Although it is sometimes hard to believe that ALL her characters are this articulate, their dialogue is a pleasure to read. <br /> <br />My one complaint has to do with the plot. The main strands of the plot (Daisy's affair with an older married man who is a friend of Eva's, Mark's continuing feelings for Eva) trail off, without any real resolution. This gives the novel an unfinished feeling.	2005-04-27
US	51277244	RTAKMWP7WTZBI	0446694843	975506815	Good Grief	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Great book	This is the story of a woman getting over her husband's death, from cancer, but it's lively, not depressing. We follow Sophie as she is given a LOA (leave of absence) from work (Loser Out of A Job, she calls it) and ends up moving from Silicon Valley (too expensive for an unemployed English major) to Ashland, Oregon, where her college friend Ruth lives with her four-year-old daughter. <br /> <br />In the year after Ethan's death, Sophie evolves from someone who wears her bathrobe and rabbit slippers to work to a woman who runs her own business, takes an increasingly important role in a difficult teenager's life, and negotiates a new relationship with an imperfect local Shakespeare festival actor. The story is rounded out by an excellent cast of supporting characters, including Ruth (who makes up swears such as \\"Fruit salad\\" to avoid cursing in front of her 4-year-old daughter), a can collector who lives at a homeless shelter, a narcissistic actress, a picky food critic, and so on.  <br /> <br />Lolly Winston is a very talented writer, in an un-showoffy way. She writes in a lively, humorous, present-tense style. <br /> <br />Recommended.	2005-04-25

They spent one night talking, ate dinner at an airport the next day, and she hasn't seen him since. On the day of her wedding to Ed, her sister, a professional \\"feng-shuier\\" with many American clients, tells Honey that Ed is in L.A. Honey and Ed live in Britain.<br /><br />Honey rips up Alex's address, but then Alex and his new wife are having their honeymoon next door at the same New York hotel. When Honey and Ed have a fight, and Ed throws his wedding ring on the bed and stalks out, things start to get interesting.<br /><br />Jenkins writes with a wonderful dry British humor and many witticisms about friendship (she and her friend Della have a Cold War, which ends with the Wardour Pact, when they run into each other on Wardour Street in London and are happy to see each other). The plot is excellent. Readers will keep going, wanting to see whom she ends up with.<br /><br />The main problem with the book is that Honey is not always likable. As a character, she is often selfish and shallow, and this may diminish a reader's affinity with her. Also, the book is marred by poor editing. At one point, a certain couple goes to Mexico, but the author can't seem to make up her mind whether the couple is in Mexico or the Caribbean.	2005-04-19
US	51277244	R3RC4DFG4XJEE6	0060195347	380627902	Ya-Yas in Bloom	Books	3	5	8	N	N	Don't bother unless you love the Ya-Ya's	This isn't really a novel, per se. Rather, it's a \\"family album format\\" where the point of view shifts frequently and there is no unifying theme or plot. There is an attempt at a plot concerning the kidnapping of a Tres Petit Ya-Ya (translation: grandchild of the Ya-Ya), but this only takes up about twenty-five pages. As if uncertain what to do next, Wells goes back and retells the kidnapping incident from another character's point of view. <br /> <br />So there is no overarching dramatic question, no lasting suspense or mystery to  keep you reading. What might keep you reading is if you love the Ya-Ya's and enjoy their company. This book probably works best if you approach it like a night with friends around the fire: cozy, relaxing, with the different friends telling stories, but it's not a novel.	2005-04-18

Sally and Mike used to date, but are still close friends and near-flatmates; Jude lives nearby as well. The three of them are inseparable until Mike starts dating the latest in his \\"parade of brunettes,\\" a younger woman named Katie. Sally, who still has submerged feelings for her ex, predicts that Katie won't last, but when Katie gets pregnant, no one can predict what the outcome will be.  <br /> <br />Henderson does a great job with plot twists and turns, and very engaging characters. Sally, Jude and Mike are so fully described that you can see what they look like and practically picture them in your living room. Henderson has a particular talent for warts-and-all description, where the reader becomes intimately familiar with every character's insecurities, Schadenfreude and sense of rivalry with the other characters. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that the plot twists toward the end of the book become increasingly difficult to believe, and this detracted from the story's \\"realness.\\" Also, at the very end the story was predictable (although not until then, which was impressive).	2005-04-14

Both live in England, and struggle with surprisingly similar issues. <br /> <br />Barbara is married to a former fighter pilot who still has nightmares about the war. They have two children. Enter Alexander, the young, handsome, Freud scholar and new boarder at her friend Bunty's house. Suddenly Barbara is questioning everything it took her years to build. <br /> <br />Siena is a career woman, a successful fashion consultant who overhauls people's wardrobes and self-esteem. Her husband, a legal aid lawyer, badly wants children. But Siena has seen too many women, in particular her friend Manda, beaten down by running after toddlers. <br /> <br />Although these are not the most original issues, they are timeless, and you really feel for the characters. They seem like real people. As in \\"Revenge,\\" Buchan's writing is smooth, delicate, and poetic. The ending is understated but poignant. The intertwining of past and present reminded me of A.S. Byatt's \\"Possession,\\" but more readable. <br /> <br />A pleasure to read.	2005-04-13

It's about three female friends and their fear of commitment.  <br /> <br />The problem is, the characters are not entirely believable. Juliet, the protagonist, is a successful businesswoman who is nonetheless almost entirely cowed by her shrewish mother and taken advantage of by her brother on welfare, who is trying to become a musician. Juliet is hung up on her ex-boyfriend, Bart. To avoid a repeat of the hurt caused by their breakup, she embarks on a series of one-night stands. Suddenly, this routine starts to feel old. <br /> <br />Juliet's overweight friend Gill is trapped in a sexless marriage. Then she leaves her husband for another man. Juliet's other friend, Mel, is a rubber-corset-wearing dominatrix who works in a fetish club. <br /> <br />These characters felt like caricatures to me...Mel's consistent coldness to her \\"slaves\\" is hard to believe, and Gill in reality would have tried to discuss her problems with her husband, especially since they had such a nice relationship otherwise. <br /> <br />In Henderson's favor, she knows how to manipulate a plot. Although it was clear that she was making up the plot as she went along (she admits it in the back of the book), you couldn't predict with certainty whom any of the women would end up with in the end. There are some fun twists along the way. <br /> <br />Overall, if you are a Henderson fan, you may want to check out this book. But I have a feeling her next novel - \\"Don't Even Think About It\\" - is better.	2005-04-12

Unless you count 25-year-old Vladimir Girshkin, who came to the U.S. from Leningrad as a young boy.<br /><br />The story follows Vladimir from the suburbs of Westchester, NY to the fictional Eastern European city of Prava, where Vladimir starts a pyramid scheme to hoodwink American investors and falls in with a group of Russian gangsters and young American expatriates.<br /><br />The plot is wildly improbable as it follows Vladimir's international exploits and the different identities he adopts in chameleon-like fashion. Much of the book's humor arises from incongruous comparisons; the Russian  gangsters have \\"the singlemindedness of first-year law students,\\" and Vladimir's girlfriend from Ohio is shocked by the eccentric, freewheeling gangsters.<br /><br />Although the prose is very funny, it could be more readable. Phrases such as \\"her cauliflower of an ear\\" or \\"her radish of a nose\\" are clunky. Overall, however, this is a unique, entertaining, sometimes dark look at one man's attempt to assimilate, and the dislocation he feels. <br />	2005-04-07

Although I couldn't put the book down after page 250 or so, and read straight through to the end (389 pages), a lot of it was extremely predictable. <br /> <br />Meet Ellie. Her alcoholic mother died years ago, and her absentee father has left her longing for a \\"real\\" family. So she's excited at the chance to meet her fiance Dan's parents and sister. Turns out his mother is a nightmare. She calls twice a day, offers to pay for their wedding then ends up micro-managing every detail of it, and tells her afterward, \\"That was my wedding. Someday you'll have a daughter and then you can have your wedding.\\" <br /> <br />Ellie's mother-in-law is irritating, true, but Ellie is too ready to let her push her buttons. One of her friends says the key is acceptance, but Ellie is always looking for a reason to be mad at her mother-in-law. It is only when Ellie finds out that her mother-in-law is a victim of sorts that Ellie comes to see her as human. <br /> <br />I could see what was going to happen to the mother-in-law from a mile away. It was a completely obvious plot development, which I will not give away here. The book then rushed to a pat conclusion. <br /> <br />Overall, I would say this is worth reading if you're a Jane Green fan, but don't start here if you're new to her. Read \\"Bookends\\" instead - that's more of a character study, less of  a cheap soap opera.	2005-03-27

This is the story of a woman who is pregnant, told to her unborn child. The child's name is Pablo Finnamore Friedman. <br /> <br />Along the way, the author advises the baby on how to treat women, fills him in on family history, and memorializes her eating habits - carrot cake, Stouffer's macaroni and cheese, the saltier and fattier, the better. On a more serious note she talks about how pregnancy purges her of cynicism, makes her feel new and childlike again.  <br /> <br />Finnamore is a very funny, talented writer who doesn't shy away from awkward truths.

Here, the characters seem less real, but the circus of a plot is distracting enough that it doesn't matter too much, especially with Kendrick's snappy dialogue (\\"Somebody call the whaaambulance,\\" one character says about a whiny villain). <br /> <br />Gwen Traynor, recently jilted at the altar, is the main character. She's getting her doctorate in psychology and sees patients at an L.A. clinic. She meets cute with Alex Coughlin, then finds out that he was once dating one of her patients, a soap-opera knockout who is a devout follower of Synchrona (a \\"cult\\" that seems to be loosely based on Scientology). Unbeknownst to Alex, he and the soap-opera star fathered a son. The actress, whose name is Harmony St. John, insists that Gwen be present when Harmony calls him with the news. And we're off and running. <br /> <br />It annoyed me that Gwen dyed her hair blonde when she felt she was in need of a life change, but at least she dyes it back by the end of the book.  <br /> <br />All in all, this was an enjoyable book, although the characters weren't as compelling as the ones in Kendrick's previous novel, and I'll be reading her new book when it comes out next year.	2005-03-24

It's a fun book. Like most \\"chick lit,\\" it's not deeply serious, but it has characters you can root for, a fast pace, and fun humor. <br /> <br />The central character is Faith Geary, a Lindbrook, Minnesota native who moved to L.A. to do travel writing after an explosion with her boyfriend, Flynn, which ended their relationship. After years of desultory dating and  flying to Italy to do articles on gelato (she has terrible jet lag), her helpless blonde sister, Skye, summons Faith back to Lindbrook to help. Skye is pregnant, her husband left her for another woman, and the bar that she and Faith started with their own investment, Roof Rat, is struggling. <br /> <br />Faith begrudgingly comes back to the small Midwestern town she thought she'd seen the last of. The setting is one of the charms of the book. So few books that I read take place in Minnesota; I was interested to see what life there is like. In this town, there's a mixture of bowtied professors and hockey players. There's also a memorable bar contest. <br /> <br />The thorn in Faith's side is the fact that she must work with Flynn, her ex, whom she left to run off with a bass player to L.A. so many years ago. Faith and Flynn have great chemistry. It's interesting to see how they deal with their history. <br /> <br />Recommended.	2005-03-23

He dies in a car accident, with another woman in the car. As she comes to terms with his infidelity, she develops a close friendship with the neighborhood mailman, Lucky, a friend of her husband's, whose wife is in rehab.  <br /> <br />Although Bena and her five children face a whole soap opera's worth of catastrophes and disasters, the tone of the book is almost never sentimental. Instead, it is told in a distinctive voice, sharp and intelligent, with characters you won't forget.  <br /> <br />One of the nicest things about this book, although it's subtle and you're not beaten over the head with it, is how Bena welcomes almost everyone into her house, even if it's under duress at first, and the characters as a whole are very forgiving about each other's imperfections. It makes you feel as if the characters form one great big family that you, as the reader, feel lucky to be a part of. <br />	2005-03-22

Eve, the 36-year-old narrator, has finally got her 44-year-old boyfriend Mike (an \\"MAJM\\" or middle-aged Jewish man; she is a \\"shiksa\\") to propose. When she tells her mother, she thinks, \\"We both rejoiced. We sold the Edsel.\\" <br /> <br />Eve loves Michael, but some of his neurotic habits drive her crazy. She imagines going to a clerk, explaining that she wanted caring and nurturing when she bought an MAJM, but not the neuroses. The clerk explains, \\"It comes with.\\" Eve also reflects that the \\"being with a black man window is closed\\", and laments on a plane to L.A. when she realizes that none of the attractive young actors (\\"They all looked like Matt LeBlanc\\") are available to her. Her love for Michael has real depth, however; when she is away from him she feels his absence as a pointed loss.  <br /> <br />Eve also has a friend whom we never meet who coins funny phrases (\\"Grand Klong\\" for a major embarrassment, \\"Petit Klong\\" for a smaller), and two great, non-stereotypical male gay friends who round out the cast.  <br /> <br />Recommended.	2005-03-20
US	51277244	R2WJDTYA471Y7N	0743464885	330178978	Luscious Lemon	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Funny at first, and then sad	\\"Luscious Lemon\\" starts out with a lot of punchy humor as the story of an Italian girl from Brooklyn, nicknamed Lemon, running an acclaimed restaurant of the same name. She harasses her staff and her friend, Franny, harasses her back. She and Franny once went through Europe together and were into the same guys and now there is unresolved tension between them.     Lemon has a boyfriend, Eddie, who is sweet to her and dying to get married. Although Lemon is an orphan, she has a grandmother and a legion of aunts and cousins who are all too happy to provide company. Suddenly, Lemon finds herself pregnant. (There's a section at the end of some of the chapters from the baby's point of view, which is interesting.)    Then the plot takes a detour when Lemon loses her baby. Nothing really holds any interest for her anymore. The author, Heather Swain, apparently also had a miscarriage and felt that not enough books dealt with this issue that affects so many women. Lemon gets through it, with the help of her family, friends, Eddie's mother (unexpectedly), and a kind-hearted Japanese dessert maker, Makiko.    I loved a lot of things about this book: the humorous exchanges between Lemon and Eddie at the doctor's office (you can see why they are a couple), the hard-earned wisdom of Lemon's grandmother, Lemon's crazy aunt Livinia who lives in her grandmother's basement, the food descriptions, and the emotions Lemon goes through.    For me, a flat spot in the narrative was the friendship between Lemon and Franny. It's just not believable. These two are always fighting, never looking out for each other. Although there are unfortunately some \\"friendships\\" between women that are like this, they are not usually this bad. Plus, it's not clear why they became friends in the first place. Franny's company is not enjoyable, even in a book.	2005-03-19

It has a somewhat slow pace that is relaxing, and folds you into the world of the book. <br /> <br />Each chapter starts with a fun Andy Warhol quote, and each chapter contains an interesting idea. In fact, the chapters could almost stand on their own as short stories. <br /> <br />Jane Laine, the main character, is smart, funny and a little uncertain of herself, while Ian Rhys-Fitzsimmons is a kind artist who doesn't let his celebrity inflate his ego. Jane Laine's boss, Dick Reese, steals many scenes as the jerk we've all worked for or worked with. Jane's mother's obsession with her schnauzers is funny. <br /> <br />I read in one of the other reviews that this book leaves a smile on your face, and it's true; it does.	2005-03-16

In this case, Flora's parents go back in time with her, and only people who love Flora recognize her in her 16-year-old body.  <br /> <br />Much of the book is shallow and lacks an emotional core, but toward the end, Flora makes a connection with a boy her \\"age\\" and makes peace with her issues in a believable way. She also manages to make things better for the people she loves as a result of her time travel.  <br /> <br />Overall, though Colgan's prose is glib without a lot of depth for much of the book, the ending is very satisfying and makes the book as a whole worth reading.	2005-03-15

A former stripper, Coco now teaches classes on how to be sexy. Ginger has to break up with one boyfriend who seems to be more into Coco than Ginger. Ginger is also a cooking student, and her teacher insults her abilities. <br /> <br />On a deeper level, this novel explores a lot of issues that are familiar to a lot of women: feeling uncomfortable in your own body, wondering if you're attractive enough, jealousy, faith in your talents. I walked away from it feeling as if I had learned something, about how you don't really need validation. <br /> <br />Also, the details are wonderful. Lehmann did her research on the sex industry, and it shows. The cooking school is also brought to loving life. <br /> <br />Recommended.	2005-03-12

Davidson has a lot of fun with the vampire idea and comes up with a lot of cute quotes: \\"I had never smelled a mixed emotion before; it was kind of like chocolate pudding on fire\\" that capture what it feels like to be a vampire.    Betsy is, of course, no ordinary vampire, but the Queen of Vampires, which means that she is immune to garlic, crosses and holy water, but not Sinclair. In terms of Sinclair's interactions with Betsy and his harem, it's pretty sexy - but not women's lib! It's all done with a light hand, though.     There are a few coincidences that are hard to believe (someone in Sinclair's camp turns out to be loyal to Sinclair's enemy, Nostro) and it is also annoying that all the \\"good\\" characters are blonde while the baddies are brunette.     Nevertheless, I'll probably be reading the sequel, Undead and Unemployed. Davidson is a good storyteller who knows how to pull you in, though it's not a sophisticated tale.	2005-03-09
US	51277244	RUT6WGXD82JH	076791676X	924240183	Tori Amos:  Piece by Piece	Books	4	9	13	N	N	Engrossing, lucid book	At first I was hesitant to buy this book. I thought that the magic of her songs just wouldn't translate to the page. But this book is such a vivid and interesting exploration of creativity and Tori's life that any ear-with-feet will be immediately hooked. The book includes \\"song canvases\\" that encapsulate her thoughts about writing different songs, such as  \\"Jamaica Inn.\\" My favorite song canvas: \\"Take to the Sky.\\" <br /> <br />The different parts of the book are as follows: <br /> <br />Introduction, \\"The Soul's Dance\\": Tori explores what it means to be an artist, and Ann Powers comments that it requires talent but mostly curiosity. <br /> <br />Chapter One, \\"Corn Mother: Genealogies\\": Tori uses a Cherokee myth about the corn mother, whom people must learn to cultivate. This is an ongoing theme throughout the book, how Tori channels different goddesses in order to be creative, and insists that she herself is not the source. This chapter is a little too Southern-fried for me with her grandfather's dialect, but there are some fascinating stories about her mother's Cherokee mother, as well as her strict, religious paternal grandmother, who is Scotch-Irish. She also describes how she learned song structure from Joni Mitchell and the Beatles, and how she chose the name Tori. <br /> <br />Chapter Two, \\"Mary Magdalene: The Erotic Muse\\": I found this chapter more commercial than any of the others, due to its emphasis on sexuality. But this is also an undeniable focus of Tori's. This chapter explores Tori's need to \\"marry the two Marys,\\" that is, the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene, who was excluded from the Bible. More broadly, it's about her need to unite the profane and the sacred. She also discusses the breakup of her relationship with Eric Rosse, how she and her husband Mark Hawley began their relationship, and her visit to Hawaii to commune with the volcano goddess, Pele. <br /> <br />Chapter Three, \\"Saraswati: The Art of Composition\\": This is about how Tori composes her songs. Basically, she sits at the piano, riffs for hours, tapes what she plays and makes a song map so she can reference what she needs in the tapes. Most of these riffs are never used. Some songs are written in one sitting, such as \\"Marianne,\\" but this is rare. The chapter also explores her collaborative relationship with her drummer and bassist. <br /> <br />Chapter Four, \\"Demeter: The Journey into Motherhood\\": This chapter describes Tori's struggle to have a child, which was truly harrowing. She had three miscarriages. Tori's sister, who is a doctor, explores the medical issues in readable language.  <br /> <br />Chapter Five, \\"Dionysus: Bringing the Music Forth\\": This chapter is about how Tori accesses her whole pantheon of goddesses in order to put on a captivating performance that connects with the audience. <br /> <br />Chapter Six, \\"Sane Satyrs and Balanced Bacchantes: The Touring Life's Gypsy Caravan\\": I felt I could have done without this chapter, especially since concerts were discussed in the previous chapter. However, it was interesting to know that Tash accompanies Tori on all her tours, and Tori chooses tour cities based on their amenability to children, availability of parks, etc. Her chef even talks about what she eats on tour. <br /> <br />Chapter Seven, \\"Venus: Creating a Public Image\\": This chapter is about how Tori presents herself to the public in a thoughtful yet striking way. It talks about her stylist, Karen Binns, and the different styles that Tori has adopted during her career. While I feel that image has never been a central concern of Tori's - she is much more about the content - there are still interesting parts in this chapter. <br /> <br />Chapter Eight, \\"The Lioness: Surviving the Music Business\\": Unexpectedly, this was one of my favorite chapters. It talks about Tori's struggles with her first label, Atlantic, and the Record Company Cheeses (her name for the music executives). It also explains why she put out Strange Little Girls, which was an album of covers instead of original songs. The conflict between Tori and Atlantic is dramatically described. She gives important advice to other musicians about contractual pitfalls to avoid. Also, this chapter includes my favorite song canvas, \\"Take to the Sky.\\" <br /> <br />Conclusion, \\"Quan Yin: The Art of Compassion\\": This chapter is about an Asian goddess who personifies kindness and compassion. Tori discusses aging in this chapter, how she feels that the life experience of older women is valuable. She ends the book on a great thought: \\"I'm trying to get back to a sense of what it means to be an artist in a community. The storyteller brings forth what is hidden, and what is being erased.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great read. When I finished it, I felt like I knew Tori better and had a deeper understanding of her songs.	2005-03-08

Apparently the author was suffering from insomnia around the time she started the book, and that inspired the title. <br /> <br />The book focuses on the relationship between a mother and her daughter, Emily, a pierced Wesleyan graduate who is dating a black man. This has the effect of tilting her mother's world slightly. However, her mother comes to love the boyfriend as a son, and the rest of the book is a poignant portrait of Emily's life choices and her boyfriend's strength of character.  <br /> <br />The book, though it deals with some dramatic events, never feels melodramatic, due to the author's light touch. However, the book is not shallow; the author deals with the divorced mother's loneliness and attachment to her daughter very convincingly and thoroughly.	2005-03-04

I am definitely interested in seeing what she writes next, as well as checking out her previous novels. <br /> <br />This is the story of Berry, a girl growing up in small-town Pinetta, Florida. Although the book starts slowly, by page 100 or so it was difficult to put down. The plot kicks in when the town of Pinetta is torn up by a hurricane. The school is destroyed, roofs are ripped off of houses, and a chain gang of convicts comes into town to help repair the roads. <br /> <br />Kincaid is extremely gifted at creating memorable characters. Berry feels  unattractive and invisible until one of the convicts starts calling her \\"Prettygirl\\". Meanwhile, her observations of the adults around her are so shrewd and intelligent that she comes off as much older than 13. Berry's father is the principal of their school, and he's not all he seems. Her mother is an attractive woman who is in love with the town pastor at the beginning of the story.  <br /> <br />Berry feels very close to her handsome brother, Sowell, who finds himself in a dramatic love triangle. \\"Our yellow cat,\\" though unnamed, is a real character in the story as well. <br /> <br />I agree with the Amazon reviewer that it was difficult to say goodbye to these characters. The one false note in the book is the ending. Starting around p. 330, the coincidences and melodramas are piled sky high, which strains the reader's credulity. The ending also doesn't resolve much. Perhaps this is realistic, however. <br /> <br />At any rate, I would have given this book 5 stars were it not for the flawed ending. It is definitely still worth reading.	2005-03-02

In conversations between Smithy and Norma, there are a lot of \\"ums\\" and their thoughts tend to jump around. Therefore, it is difficult to follow the thread of their conversations.  <br /> <br />It also seemed to be one of those improbable stories where everyone is quite damaged: Smithy is obese, lonely, and alcoholic; Bethany (his sister) was psychotic; Smithy's friend Norma is in a wheelchair, and so on. It is also never explained why Norma is in a wheelchair, or at what point she began to need one. She's a major character so it would have been nice to know about these things. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, Smithy is memorable as a sweet, fat, bashful guy who harbors loving, perhaps even romantic, feelings for his sister Bethany. Her mental illness manifests itself in a \\"voice\\" that frequently tells her to take all her clothes off and freeze her body into a stationery pose. Although she dies early in the story, the novel is told in a series of flashbacks that illuminate her life. <br /> <br />A strong point in the novel is Smithy's bicycle journey across country, which ends up at a morgue in L.A., where he views Bethany's corpse. Along the way, he meets many interesting people (including a demoted priest, a man with AIDs, a crazed homeless artist in Washington Square Park, a young woman who is attracted to him, and so forth). He also loses a lot of weight (at the beginning, he is 279 pounds), starts to like himself more and starts to resolve his issues with the past. <br />	2005-03-02
US	51277244	RLUODDICU9UDY	0743496957	636177397	American Girls About Town	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Uneven collection	Some of these stories are good, while others I skipped over. I like a lot of chick lit, but also some more serious lit, so I am probably a good barometer. For me, the highlights of the collection were: <br /> <br />Claire LaZebnik, \\"Leaving a Light On\\": Claire wrote \\"Same as It Never Was,\\" a novel I read last summer and loved. I highly recommend it. Anyway, \\"Leaving a Light On\\" showcases her same clever but easy-to-read style and absorbing, instantly relatable characters. This story is about a woman who puts on a little black dress and heads out for a night at a bar and picks up a married guy...but the reader is in for a big surprise about both of them. <br /> <br />Lauren Henderson, \\"Yoga Babe\\": I love yoga so I may be a bit biased, but I thought Lauren really created a memorable character here. It's about a princess type who's befuddled by the fact that a stocky girl with hairs on the back of her thighs can beat her at yoga. <br /> <br />Cindy Chupack, \\"Moving Day\\": This was written by the same woman who wrote the scripts for \\"Sex and the City.\\" There was a little too much telling as opposed to showing in her story, but all the same, it's a funny story about a girl who finds out her husband is gay and starts over. <br /> <br />Jennifer Weiner, \\"The Truth About Nigel\\": This story is set in London for some reason, and Weiner uses some British-isms like \\"crisps\\" but at other times the dialogue sounds totally American. So that was a drawback. But the plot, about an office worker who falls in love with an impostor, is interesting enough. <br /> <br />Melissa Senate, \\"Voodoo Dolls, C-Cups and Eminem\\": This is about a woman who is getting married to a man she's only known for six weeks. Her family  is opposed, and her sister expresses her feelings in an unexpected way! <br /> <br />Chris Manby, \\"Bad Manners\\": This is about a girl who dates a member of the British royalty, who is totally rude! <br /> <br />Jill Smolinski, \\"Forty Days\\": This one drags a bit but is a nice example of \\"older\\" chick lit, like Claire Cook's novels (Must Love Dogs, Multiple Choice). Smolinski herself wrote Flip-Flopped, an okay book. Anyway, Forty Days is about a woman approaching 40 who decides to do something she's never done before on each of the forty days before birthday. <br /> <br />Gretchen Laskas, \\"Small Worlds\\": While this story is a little creepier and darker than the rest, it is memorable for its vivid characterizations. It's about a woman who's unhappy because she and her husband can't have a child, and I don't want to  give away the rest. <br /> <br />Lauren Weisberger, \\"The Bamboo Confessions\\": I'm not sure how great a writer Weisberger is, but when she has an interesting situation, she can write a good story. Here the focus is on a girl who goes to Vietnam by herself, meets some new friends and gains some insight into her boyfriend back home. <br /> <br />Julianna Baggott, \\"Five\\": This is an unusual story about a woman who just left her fourth husband and is looking for her fifth, while staying with her sister and her sister's husband. <br /> <br />The other stories - by Adriana Trigiani, Laura Wolf, Judy Hendricks, Sarah Mlynowski, Quinn Dalton, Nancy Sparling, and Lynda Curnyn - just didn't hold my attention, even though I'm an avid reader. I thought they were dull and plodding. But the stories I described above were enjoyable. It might be a good bet to take this one out of the library. <br /> <br />	2005-02-28

It's a story about women who are adjusting to having or not having kids. One of the characters is referred to as \\"Yoga Barbie\\" because of her blonde hair and perfect body, but she is struggling with her unemployed husband. Another woman is trying to get over the loss of her own baby, who died.  <br /> <br />The most memorable character is Becky, who is probably modeled on Weiner herself - a spunky, overweight woman who meets life head-on and has an answer for everything. Becky's accounts of meeting her husband, the early days of their relationship, and their sexual problems in the beginning, are tragicomic. Her skirmishes with her mother-in-law are also entertaining and the outcome is enlightening.	2005-02-28

Clare and Henry are the couple that the book follows. They are destined to be each other's great love, but they cannot always be together because Henry is jostled back and forth in time.<br /><br />Therefore, they meet up at different points in time. The difference in their ages does not even remain stable. Sometimes Henry is 45 and Clare is 28; other times Clare is 7 and Henry is 36; sometimes, though not often, Clare is older than Henry.<br /><br />In this way, the book is startling and original. Henry is briefly involved with another woman when he cannot be with Clare, but he does not love the other woman. She shows up eventually to exact her revenge.<br /><br />I admired the author's ability to execute this striking and original idea, but sometimes I wanted the story to linger in one time frame so it could focus more on the characters and less on the concept.	2005-02-28

But the book is good anyway (and I LOVE dogs). The main character, Christopher, is autistic and feels very close to animals. That's why he takes it upon himself to find out who killed the dog. He starts out by going door to door and interviewing people in his neighborhood. <br /> <br />The mystery is eventually solved (although not by the above method), but along the way we get to know Christopher, who likes the number 2, loves math, and is perplexed by the way most people's minds wander. The author does a great job of getting inside this unusual character's head and making us sympathize with him. The ending is uplifting.	2005-02-28

This is not \\"deep literature,\\" but it is a lot of fun, and touches on issues such as finding a career, leaving relationships that are bad for you, facing up to your limitations and being proud of your strengths.  <br /> <br />McCouch's primary gift as an author is creating a full fictional world (the professional kitchen in Girl Cook). Here, it's the ski slope. McCouch packs the novel with details about ski instructing and skiing itself that make this world full and believable. <br /> <br />Mountain Betty is about a girl named Elizabeth who went to a small liberal arts college, got fired, and then moved to Jackson Hole, Wyoming with her married-but-separated boyfriend to live the skiing life: free lift passes, teaching lessons, and working as a cocktail waitress at the Mangy Moose. She is growing tired of working so hard just to make ends meet (barely), especially when her boyfriend is a little too fond of recreational drugs and women.  <br /> <br />This is a lively, fun narrative written with a deft touch. McCouch has an MFA from Columbia and is definitely talented. Recommend.	2005-02-28

It is as if Curtis Sittenfeld held up a microscope to her high school experience and committed it all to sometimes horrifying memory. Parts of the book are so poignant that I had to stop and let them settle in before continuing. One of the most powerful aspects of the book is the central character, Lee. It's one of the most warts-and-all portrayals I've ever read. Lee's sexual insecurity, lack of self-worth, crush on Cross Sugarman, latent racism, and constant awareness of her relative poverty at the fictitious, prestigious, money-loaded Ault School are bravely and fully on display. The book is told with excruciating detail, including authentic prep-school kid dialogue and close observations. For example, Lee is fully aware of the difference between her bubbly self growing up (she won a pie contest in her hometown) and her quiet, watchful self at prep school, constantly monitoring her own behavior and observing others. The difficulty of balancing these two selves makes Parents' Weekend an especially wrenching experience for her.	2005-02-27

I cared just enough about the characters to see what was going to happen to them. &lt;Spoiler alert> Every character is a cliche - the codependent, needy wife; the husband who wants to abdicate his responsibilities and takes up with a prostitute; an anorexic girl; and a girl who cuts herself with razors and Swiss army knives. Marquit's jaded, in-your-face style, with liberal use of profanity and a Darwinian view of high school, is one-sided. Her characters are GOOD or BAD, not multi-dimensional. As far as the plot goes, I got the sense that most of this stuff had never happened to her, and she was going for shock value rather than authenticity. For a high school experience that is rendered in living, breathing, convincing color, I would recommend Curtis Sittenfeld's PREP instead.	2005-02-25

On the plus side, this is ambitious, creative, original writing.<br />On the negative side, the narrative is often incoherent, and sometimes so emotionally shattering that one longs for it to end. It is also marred by a persistent &quot;Aren't I clever?&quot; whispering around the edges of the text.<br />Overall, it is worth reading if you have some spare time, but seriously flawed.	2003-05-27
US	51277244	R1RMTDQ971OJ65	0671042572	835489451	Jewel	Books	3	3	4	N	N	great content, horrible writing	First of all, let me say that I really admire Bret Lott for writing about a child with Down Syndrome and the child's relationship with her mother. I also admired the mother and child for their indomitable spirit. However,  Mr. Lott's style is painful to read...meandering, graceless and filled with  quotations from the Bible, which is a great and sacred source, but the  numerousness of the quotations suggested that Mr. Lott was not comfortable  with his own writing (which could definitely use improvement).	2000-07-27

Although it had some flaws (the author did dwell on Ruth's chest way too much, for no apparent reason), most of the book was so gratifying that I am still thinking about the  issues it raised. For anyone who is interested in writing, it is fantastic  to see how Irving balances so many perspectives and how he creates  stories-within-stories, since many of the characters in Irving's novel are  also writers. While this might make people shake their heads and think,  &quot;Oh no, it's a writer writing about writers again,&quot; don't let  this dissuade you from reading the book. Irving has such a feel for  character development and a virtuosity with different styles that the book  was a pleasure to read. He also is one of the few authors around today who  is equally fascinated with love/romance and sex; most authors seem to focus  on one or the other.	2000-07-27

However, the protagonist Kathryn makes discoveries about her late husband Jack that are very hard to believe, so there is a strain on the reader's credulity in a  tale that otherwise tries very hard to be authentic -- for example, Ms.  Shreve examines the nature of grief with excellent insight, pointing out  that it is often harder for children and teenagers than it is for adults to  accept the death of a loved one. I found insights like these to be thought  provoking and true. But Kathryn's obliviousness to her husband's activities  while he was alive, and the magnitude and extent of her husband's  activities, induce skepticism in the reader even though the rest of the  book is so strong and believable.	2000-07-27
US	51277244	R30IYE8ZT5FYGV	0399145990	217600181	The River King	Books	4	6	9	N	N	carefully crafted and intriguing	This book takes a little while to get going, because there is a lot of description and not as much action in the beginning, but it is worth it because Ms. Hoffman creates her setting so painstakingly and convincingly.  The book deals with the cruelties and class rifts that occur in a private  school and the working-class town where the school is located. The book has  riveting images and strong, believable characters. It will probably give  some parents second thoughts about sending their children to private  school, especially since some of the hazing rituals probably had some  grounding in reality.	2000-07-27
US	51277244	R42W5HBY470JC	0060925000	832364601	A Suitable Boy	Books	5	0	0	N	N	one of my favorite books	Mr. Seth is a wonderful writer with tremendous scope and vision. If you enjoy Dickensian novels with huge casts of characters and social conscience, read this. On one level, it is a fun and enjoyable tale of one  girl's mother and her search for a marriageable boy for her daughter; on  another level, it is an examination of arranged marriage, independence,  individualism, love, family, poverty, politics, prostitution and Indian  culture. I can't recommend this enough.	2000-07-21

His lover also faces a problem that may compromise her  career in music. If you can overlook the central character's behavior, the  book is quite enjoyable.	2000-07-21
US	51277244	R2TONFCDESU5H6	0609604074	330040046	Trans-Sister Radio	Books	4	6	6	N	N	interesting; jarring	I'm not quite sure how to react to this novel, although I liked it. Mr. Bohjalian has yet again written a daring and gripping novel about people who are at once easy to relate to and difficult to fathom. Some parts of  the book were painful to read (the surgery section is not for the  squeamish). However, Mr. Bohjalian brings great insight to the intersection  of the personal and political, and writes about a usually forbidden topic  with understanding and kindness. This is not a topic I would have been  interested in if Mr. Bohjalian didn't write it, but since he was the  author, I enjoyed it almost as much as &quot;Midwives&quot; and &quot;The  Law of Similars.&quot;	2000-06-08
US	51277244	RQISY2ATNHSZJ	0671510053	357229344	The Shipping News	Books	4	3	3	N	N	worth reading	Ms. Proulx's style takes some getting used to -- her writing is episodic, with abrupt changes of subject, and she doesn't seem terribly interested in the psychology of her characters. However, as you read on, you find that  she expresses her characters' natures through their actions. The story is  absorbing even though it is set in a cold, isolated place where everyone  seems interested mainly in shipping and knots. The characters are among the  quirkiest you'll encounter. Like Postcards, which I actually liked a little  better, The Shipping News has some sharply delineated images which will  linger in your mind for a while.	2000-06-08
US	51277244	R2LHWHWS051UQA	0375704248	340816337	Falling Slowly	Books	3	3	5	N	N	ugh	The first three quarters of this novel were difficult to endure. Ms. Brookner writes with a sort of quiet despair that permeates every page with little or no comic relief. However, the novel picked up near the end, and  it was nice to see Ms. Brookner analyze a different emotion and infuse her  characters with some life. At any rate, though, I'm in no rush to read  another of her novels.	2000-06-08
US	51277244	R2BI0IJZKCNYIG	0060928557	137095710	Heat Wave: A Novel	Books	5	7	8	N	N	chilling	This book is very well written. The characters come fully to life and Ms. Lively examines the emotion of jealousy with a thoroughness that I haven't come across before. Most people who have ever been jealous or insecure in a  relationship will be able to relate to Ms. Lively's characters who suffer  from jealousy, but Ms. Lively takes the plot a step further and introduces  an observer - the mother - who cannot stand to see her daughter cheated on,  in part because the mother went through the same agony. This book isn't  bashing men or relationships, though; Ms. Lively includes loyal men and  healthy relationships in the novel. You wonder, though: is Ms. Lively  intellectually compelled by the notion of jealousy, or has she felt it  herself to this extent? The novel is balanced between careful observation  and heated emotion.	2000-05-24
US	51277244	R2S03F8X9YUTVI	0802135331	373377229	Moon Tiger	Books	4	5	7	N	N	great book	This was an excellent book but I thought the writing was a little self-conscious. The narrator kept explaining, &quot;I am writing a history of my life,&quot; &quot;I am writing about different periods of my life and  splicing them together into one narrative,&quot; &quot;I am interested in  history,&quot; etc. Aside from this flaw, the book was very entertaining  and an excellent character study. The narrator, Claudia, is feisty and  memorable; she is a colorful, competitive person. Her usual toughness and  snide sense of humor makes the core of the book -- an affair that drew her  deepest emotions to the surface and made her vulnerable --even more  striking.	2000-05-24
