Because of the author's cold calculation that his opening of the book - consisting of a masturbatory scene - would intrigue and tittilate the reader. Maybe if one is wrting to make a buck, this kind of thing is understandable. But that will never make it right. There are other Les Standiford novels on the bookshelves.

And because he has a great reputation he can get junk like this published. It is supposed to be amusing and/or droll, but it reads like a complete waste of time. It may be possible that there is some great message or point to be made here and I am just too stupid to see it. But, failing that, someone would have to point out to me what value there is in this rambling tale of sexual misadventures and attempts to transplant a hand.

He uses his talent to construct a novel like July 4th fireworks that are beautiful and exciting. At the conclusion, however, the reader is left with ashes and an empty sky. I don't always need a happy ending but I also do not like hopeless ones or endings that are depressing. One is left with the impression that the author was very clever, leads one down a garden path, and then ultimately leaves one gutted. Lehane ought to use his talent to better effect than to simply dazzle us, let us taste everything, and then abandon us with our stomachs upset.	2003-06-05

Many writers write just about the same book every time. This novel is a real gem in the detective/thriller genre. I don't think I've ever read one as good. The characters, the dialogue, the plot, and EVERYTHING come together in a superbly well crafted tale. I defy anyone to figure out whodunnit before the final pages. Yet it makes perfect sense.

This book is touted as a sequel to his \\"The General's Daughter\\" (that became a John Travolta movie) but only the only evidence of that is using the same name of the hero. Not much action here; mostly recollections of old battles and how the old battlefields look 30 years after the war. DeMille writes very well but has a habit of not finishing his novels. In this one, the reader wants to know - So what happened to the hero? - to the girl? - to the Vice President? Etc. He did this in his \\"The Lion's Game\\" also and even more shamefully. This is cheating the reader. In real like we take these hits, but as readers we trust the writer to give us the full story and the neat endings we are denied in life.	2003-04-27

In this novel, however, he is out of his millieu. The \\"hero\\" is a golfer/crime-solver. This character and others in the book are irritating. Bernhardt is no humorist and his attempts at humor are pathetic. This novel is so sophmoric that it is difficult to believe that the same man wrote this book AND his many other novels that I admire.

In this book about life-and-basketball, Conroy brings us up-to-date on his life and teaches us valuable lessons about every life.

You have to ask yourself why anyone would write a book about characters that no one would never want to spend a moment with, let alone read about...in a so-called plot that is depressing and irrelevant to most ordinary readers. This sad, dull book is replete with a lot of flashbacks of earlier years in the lives of the first-person \\"writer\\" and his sister, who is mentally and emotionally [messed] up.

This is probably more true-to-life than most of us (who opt for more action and contrived situations) like in this genre. Not a bad read but it is ambivalent and, with two authors, one understands why. If you like books about the military and WWII,, you'll like this book.

It is difficult to believe that the brilliant scholarship that is so evidently displayed in the beginning can denigrate into such an ineffective, rambling narrative.

The British seem to turn out these spy novels with too many characters to keep track of, all muddled up in incomprehensible comings, goings, and way too much gawd-awful talk. I read for pleasure and it is just too much work to try and understand what the hell is going on, who said what and why, etc. These Brit spy novels also have the unhappy habit of no-emphasis on conversations and events, thus a murder equates with buttering a piece of bread as far as the text is concerned.

Although this novel is well-written, the charaters solid, and the tale holds interest, this author will have to do better plot-wise to become a force in this genre.

Am I confusing you? You betcha! And this novel will do the same. I dislike stories that take place in asylums, as much of this novel does. There was no one to admire or identify with unless you have a yen to be a nut. Read one of Maxim's other books; this one was a bad idea poorly executed.	2002-05-10

You are supposed to believe that the \\"good killers\\" are better than the \\"bad killers.\\" The author never even suspects that killing (in and of itself) is evil. No, it is just that the good guys kill better than the baddies. In Maxim's world, as we find it in this book, maiming and killing are okay because the evil doers have asked for it. I'll normally go along with the author and try to \\"believe\\" but this story was way too much of a stretch. Try one of Maxim's other books.	2002-05-08

Although this novel is a &quot;thriller&quot; by definition, the parts of Maxim's writing that I enjoy most are not the action parts of a book. It is the character deveopment, the location descriptions, and the love story that I really like. The author does an excellent job with those things in this novel. Just the right length too; not stretched out nor too thin. You will enjoy Maxim's other books if you like this one. I did and do.	2002-05-06

A good plot, interesting characters, and well-written. My only reason for not giving this five stars was that it becomes a bit overlong. This book could have said and done all it had and still been had 80% less verbose. The author is recommended to all readers.

It takes a whole novel to tell you this: A young lady lies and says an ex-Texas Ranger had insulted her. Her boyfriend is incensed and, egged on by his manic father, shoots the ranger dead in a gunfight. The rest of the book and characters are nothing but filler.

This is an engaging read; I've never read anything quite like it. My only reason for not giving this book five stars is that I don't think the author mined enough gold from the rich lode he discovered.

He does not write &quot;mysteries&quot; in the classic sense; he writes police-procedural novels. You get the salty cop dialogue, an authentic inside look at what a cop's life is like, and all of the political, criminal, and hectic details - since the author is a former NYPD lieutenant. If you want a read &quot;with the bark off&quot; and enjoy hearing what a cop's life is REALLY like, you will enjoy this book immensely.

You recognize it as fact; he's been there. His other books tell stories from the police side of things. This one tells about the narcotic trade from the inside as the reader follows the dangerous life of a detective who goes undercover. There is a crushing anaconda, a mysterious feminine killer, and much more. Novelists are able to deduct travel from their income tax which is why we see so many exotic locations in these books and this one is no exception. Some authors end up sounding like travel writers but Caunitz makes it work. Other thriller writers have achieved more fame but no one makes police/detective stories LIVE the way this author does. Try it, you'll like it.	2002-04-28

Nevertheless it snaps and crackles with the dialogue and insider information that only Caunitz (a 30-year cop) could provide. You can read all of the police novels you want but you will NEVER find an author that gives you as much of the inside scoop on police work, language, and character. His plots are fascinating, his characters different yet utterly believable, and his mastery of giving a lot of information in a few words is unmatched. Caunitz was, quite simply, the best of them all at this kind of a novel. Rest In Peace, William J. Caunitz...I'll be re-reading your books from time to time until (hopefully) we meet in the beyond.	2002-04-28

His inside knowlege of police procedures, interactions of the characters, squad room banter, and all-around details of the world of law enforcement, contribute to a fascinating read. Nothing is spared here; the plot gives all the details of gory murder, sexual perversion, double lives led by some police, and political intrigue.

A wronged young woman steals a cache of stories written by a famous writer and begins to destroy the stories piece by piece as the detective searches for her and for the writings. The novel reads like a local Sarasota travelogue (Sarasota is where author Kaminsky resides) and the story is recounted in the first person by &quot;hero&quot; Lew Fonesca. He tells the story in an unadorned no-frills fashion, simply recounting facts. The unfortunate result of this technique is that we simply don't care who wins, loses, is guilty, or innocent, or WHY! &quot;Folk-siness&quot; only takes an author so far. He/she also has to give you REASONS TO CARE. Kaminsky doesn't.	2002-04-09

Neither the murder case nor the suspect were interesting enough for me; I found no reason to care. The parts of the book having to do with a homosexual relationahip were distasteful to me and unnecessary to the story. I found the plot hard to believe; I want to \\"go along\\" with the author and his premise but it was too much of a stretch in this novel.

The characters are largely those of his other books, which is a treat in itself. I'd just like to say that the plot is inventive, suspenseful, and ingenious. The payoff and wind-up very satisfying.

Readers are asked to believe that detective hero Devlin would accompany his paramour to Cuba, placing her, his friend, and himself in mortal danger - in order to seek out the dismembered corpse of his lover's aunt and give the body a &quot;proper burial.&quot; Poor character definition, poor plot, and a lot of mumbo-jumbo history of Cuban voodoo.

Good characters, good plot, superior writing; Pearson has it all. Unfortunately he wrote a novel here that is too long for the plot. It gets tedious because the author STRETCHED the plot and spent much too much verbiage on a non-essential sub-plot of a troubled child.

Maybe this is a more true-to-life story than most I've read since the hero's girlfriend is seduced by the villian and the end of the story tells you that the bad guy may well get away with his depredations - BUT - I get enough of that kind of disillusion in real life.

I liked the different plot, the characters, and the whole &quot;feel&quot; of the book. It is different and very clever. I read it in one day. The sole criticism of the novel for me is that I could not get a real clear picture of the hero, Tyler. Whether that is the fault of the author or it is mine as the reader is unclear to me. I'd like to have known Tyler better, is my complaint. But this is a compelling, fascinating thriller.	2002-03-22

Suffice to say that, if you like cop/thief/Mafia type stories this is one of the most intelligent, realistic thrillers of the genre. The &quot;hero&quot; is a thief; a consumate pro. Once the ending is known, it seems inevitable but you can't see it coming anyway.

There is no point to this tale, no hero, no heroine, nothing to teach. There is certainly no satisfaction in the story nor in its end. Much of the novel tells of gruesome medical practices and unpleasant people doing money-grubbing business.<br />It will always be a mystery to me WHY people of such admirable gifts as the author possesses, do not use these gifts to either depict people, places, and customs that we might admire and emulate - or - show us people that we might despise or scorn, but who might teach us something about life that is worth knowing. Perhpas it is the author's age (29) and the fact that he has not lived long enough to think upon these things that are responsible for his lack of insight. Except for the author's undeniable skill this lamentable tale limps along to a most unsatisfactory end. What are we to make of this, Mister Griffin?	2002-02-13

This is the second novel in a series featuring Conrad Voort, the richest detective in New York. It is about a female serial killer who hates men. What makes this novel (and the other books in the series) so enjoyable is that it mixes police work with the personal (romantic/sexual) life of hero Voort - and that life is a fascinating, well-written one. I read this genre all the time but I found Ethan Black's novels more enjoyable than most. My problem is that he doesn't write them fast enough and so far there are only three published.	2001-11-07

Fresh, original, imaginative, well-written...these words and other superlatives can be applied to the three murder mysteries written by Ethan Black. In this novel the members of 'The Broken Hearts Club' kill the women who &quot;done them wrong.&quot; Conrad Voort, the richest detective on the NYC force, is in hot pursuit. What also makes for good reading is the private life of Voort whose family history and romantic/sexual adventures are woven seamlessly into the story. If you read one Ethan Black novel, you'll read them all. This is the first in the series.	2001-11-07

The plot details his activities in investigating a series of accidents that have been deliberately staged in order to collect insurance. The bad guys are big monied people from the USA in business with the Russian Mafia. The author tells some fascinating tales of how accidents are analyzed, even to the mathematical formulae used. This is an unusual story because it uses so many different areas of typical thrillers; military, civilian, and police. This is my first Dan Simmons book; it won't be my last.	2001-11-01

The problem I had with this book is that, plot-wise, almost all of it has been done before. The time of the novel is just after the second world war and the action takes place in Germany. The bad guy is a dedicated SS officer who escapes from prison. He plans to assasinate one of the big three (Truman, Churchill, Stalin) in order to shape the political/economic future of Germany. The hero of the piece is an American officer (former policeman/lawyer) whose priest/brother was killed in cold blood by the Nazi. He pursues the bad guy. My interest flagged three-quarters of the way through. Maybe you'll do better.	2001-11-01

A fascinating and unusual plot; never read anything like it before. Asked by a friend to investigate a list of names, the hero/detective of this novel finds that the people listed are dying - apparently by accident. None of the people are connected to one another. The man who gave the hero the list also dies in an &quot;accident.&quot; You'll never predict the ending of this one. Novelist Ethan Black has a first rate imagination and writes very very well. The personal details of the detective's life are every bit as fascinating as the professional side. One helluva good read!!	2001-11-01

It tells me all about the lives of the greatest songwriters the world has ever known...where they grew up, how they got into songwriting, what they wrote, who they wrote with, the movies and shows they did, and so much more. The era described extends from 1927 to the mid-sixties when rock arrived. During that period the greatest American songs were written. It is doubtful that the world will ever know another such a wonderful period or such songwriters. This is a book to treasure; to be read and reread if you remember the classic songs of that era.	2001-10-02

This villian is a fiend who tortures, mutilates, and kills for fun and profit.

What would the world be like if Ronald Reagan did not become president? One must admire the audacity of the author to write a story with that possibility as a main feature of the plot. I loved the hero going back to the &quot;old&quot; Hollywood, meeting some of the early stars and seeing the inside of the studios that are long gone. The trips through time allow the reader to see how the future changes every time the hero takes another trip to the past.  I found it fascinating and read the book in one day.

According to author Simmons, readers are supposed to like to read about a &quot;hero&quot; who committed a revenge killing, served eleven years, and now comes out of jail to be an unlicensed &quot;investigator&quot; who knocks bad guys out with a sap, breaks legs, and kills without thought or remorse. It's okay, though...these bad guys are all trying to kill him! He is such a &quot;nothing&quot; character that I almost wanted to do him in, myself.

It is wearing, enervating, and annoying. I prefer something that the author has at least predigested for me, with a point of view, and with a main character that I like and can identify with.

But once they reach any age and have read a few really good books, this sort of thing is laughable. The Red Ripper, INDEED! Why not The Chartruse Carver? Why not The Scarlet Skewer?

Dan Mahoney is unique in that he does not write the usual police or detective &quot;thriller.&quot; What he really writes are police-procedure novels.

You are in on their conversations, their thoughts, and their actions. If you want to know how it all works, plus get-to-know a number of fascinating characters, this is your book. I gave it 4 stars, not 5, because I miss Mahoney's usual hero, &quot;McKenna&quot;; this book features one of his other detectives, &quot;Cisco&quot; who was a minor character in other Mahoney books.

Then we get three pages raving about how good this book is- AND IT ISN'T! The cover informs us that the author has won the Edgar Award... well, you can bet it wasn't for this meandering plot. The book reads as if it is written for fans who already know and sympathize with the hero - but I didn't and I don't. This is sloppy writing. It takes way too long to get into the meat of the story and when you do, it is confusing and you don't give a hoot about any of the characters. In fact, I was wishing that the killer - who is almost absent in the book - would kill off the entire cast. Harlan Coben entertains himself, not the reader.	2001-06-29

This is obviously the first of a series of novels (again, like Doc) and we may even see a TV series or a movies for the authors. Not a bad plot; the writing is good too.  But original? Uh-uh.

I believe the author has superlative writing skills but there is no character in this book that a reader can admire, or identify with, or root for.  The plot is like a bad dream wherein the same stupid things keep happening or almost happening over and over.  This book and his previous book, &quot;The Laws Of Our Fathers&quot; are a depressing waste of a great talent.  I keep hoping that Turow will find a good &quot;leading man&quot; for a decent plot (someone we would enjoy spending time with) - and I am sadly disappointed that he does not.

A fascinating story of people trapped in Nazi occupied France in World War II. The author knows his subject, the terrain, the characters, and all the small details of the time and the situations described.  The sole defect of this book is that the author tells his tale so straight and somehow at-a-distance that the author does not seem to care who wins or loses and thus, neither does the reader.  The author also does unnecessay embellishment; for instance we read pages of background on a priest - a minor character who appears briefly - for no apparent reason.  Robert Daley is a craftsman who does a good job of writing - but he neither varnishes nor polishes his work.  Good while you read it, but soon forgotten when you put it down.	2001-01-19

He writes well, he plots well; but he commits two cardinal sins in his novel.  First, he fails to give us a point-of-view and, because he does not do so, (Secondly) he never makes us give a damn about any character in his scenario.  When an author does this, no matter how fascinating the facts of his plot may be (and in this novel they are not interesting) we &quot;trudge&quot; through the book instead of being swept along by the writer.  Long before the end of the story I was bored and tired of the plot, the people, and of Westermann's inability to make me care, even a little.  On the other hand, if you have insomnia - here's your cure!	2001-01-02

It's always difficult to write a bad review when one realizes the weeks and months that must go into writing a novel.  But this book is just a waste.  The idea for the book is good and it begins well.  A woman is been found dead and the hero recognizes the face of his old love when he sees a reconstruction of the face of the corpse.  But from that point the author does not know where to go.  The plot limps along with a lot of pointless conversations, little action, and badly described emotions.  It is difficult to maintain interest in the characters.  I wish I had not read this book and - if you buy it - you'll be sorry too.	2000-12-27

This is a harsher, more realistic story of a wagon train heading to Oregon and of the hardships encountered.  The characters are interesting and well defined; their situations are basic, difficult, and (at times) horrible.  I suspect that this is what the Old West was really like.  This book definitely held my interest; I only wish it had continued for a few more chapters; there were additional problems in the story that needed (in my opinion) to be resolved.  But I would recommend this book to a friend.  If you like Westerns, you'll like this book.	2000-12-13

It's hard to put this book down until you find out what happens.  An experienced detective and a forensic pathologist pursue domestic terrorists who are bent on blowing up the president of the United States and scores of bystanders.  The plot is an ingenious one with enough unexpected twists and turns to surprise even those of us who generally sniff out the ending of a mystery novel half-way through the story.

And, it is a useful book for anyone who ever has to be interviewed for any reason, anywhere, anytime.

The plot hinges on two of the &quot;suckees&quot; - deepsea divers - acting like oversexed Neanderthals who become rapacious killers in a Utopia that knows no violence.  The characters in this book are so unreal, their actions so inexplicable and &quot;far out,&quot; that the novel becomes laughable.  The premise, the plot, and the characters are so cartoon-like that the reader weeps for Robin Cook; to think that a well-known author's gift is revealed as so thin and fragile.

I gave this novel two stars because the author writes beautifully and there is no doubt he is a writer of talent and power.  Unfortunately he uses his gift to tell a story of monsterously deformed human beings who are treated with cruelty. Why any reader would want to put such images into his/her mind (which is the equivalent of eating sewage) is anyone's guess.  I did not know what I was getting into when I bought this book and I sure wish I had not read it.  Is it a &quot;horror novel?&quot;  Yes, but not the kind of story or descriptions that you would ever want to read.  How terribly sad that an author with such possibility chose to depict monsters rather than to show us beauty.  I will never read another James Herbert novel.	2000-11-21

Naturally, men wanted to photograph women in the nude and &quot;in the act.&quot; I say it is &quot;strange&quot; because many of the women are ugly or dowdy with bodies that are undesirable, to say the least.  Few knew how to pose at the time and many of the ladies seem almost pathetic in their lack of artifice.  One cannot escape the idea that the viewer may be looking at an ancestor and - also a jarring thought - the vast majority of the women (and men) in this book are dead.  If you want a haunting reminder of days past and that we are all mortal, buy this book.  If you're looking for erotica, this isn't it.	2000-11-01

You have to laud his research, scholarship, and the imagination that keeps coming up with something new and timely.  Having said all that, this book takes much too long to get started. Also, unless you are interested in ancient history and/or physics you really have to slog through a lot of tedious expository material that the author force-feeds you in order to understand his plot. The characters are not memorable in my opinion. This is a time-travel story.  After the main characters go back to the past, they muck about in uninteresting situations until you are almost begging the author to make an end to it.  By the time the surviving good guys win, you feel as if you have been buffeted about the head with a pig bladder.  Don't buy this book; wait for the movie.  Films have a way of cutting out all the junk and this book needs that.	2000-10-30

Then - chapter after chapter (and city after city) the tale becomes so trite and repetitious that it does the almost-impossible; it makes a book about a serial killer BORING.  What is missing from most of books of this genre - and certainly from this one - is WHY SHOULD WE, THE READERS, CARE about the characters?  The answer is WE DON'T! Go buy a Dick Francis novel (anyone of them) and you'll get a better, less gory, less sensational (but much more intelligent and entertaining) read.	2000-10-22

Well, that is very like this book where all the pieces are in place, everything seems okay, but the lightning never strikes!  It never comes to life; you can never quite believe it.  Good writers lend a kind of grace to their work and you are drawn in, seduced, involved, and you &quot;live along with it.&quot;  These authors are workmanlike, but without that grace.  If I knew how to do it, I'd be writing.  But I know it when I see it and this isn't it.  Nothing wrong with this plot or these characters that Louis L'Amour couldn't fix.  But these authors either didn't and probably can't.  Still - this is a first book; maybe they'll improve.	2000-10-18

This is an excellent writer and the personal details of the hero's life are much more fascinating than the murder mystery.  But all that virtue is buried under such horrifying, stomach-turning descriptions of bodies hacked, sliced, and violated in every way - that THIS reader lost interest.

This one, however, is sterile.  Kellerman only goes through the motions of writing without developing his on-going characters and with scenes and situations that are unpleasant.  I do not want to plod through an institution for the insane, endure the disgusting descriptions of the inmates, and read about gory murders without having some reward... either in the writing, the characters, a visit to somewhere pleasant - SOMETHING!  This book is an unrelieved nightmare and any possible reader is advised that he/she will only put garbage into the mind without any reward or insight when the book is finished.

It is a  unique, disturbing, and edifying experience.  Told in the first person by  &quot;Henry,&quot; who looks back on tragic events of long ago, the story  moves slowly, agonizingly, with gathering shadows and dark portents.  There  are certain stories - books and movies - that seem to define the  reader/viewer.  I have, for instance, asked many people what the movie  &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; was about and I have never had anywhere near  the same definition twice.  This book is like that.  It plumbs the minds,  spirits, and emotions of its characters, evokes tingling suspense, and  fulfills its haunting promise with an ending that you will never forget.   Not for &quot;action&quot; readers, but so very very rewarding for those of  us who look for excellent writing, plotting, and &quot;something  different.&quot;  It will leave and indelible mark in your reading-mind.	2000-08-21

A good  tension-packed read wherein you cannot wait to see what happens next.

Because I read three or four books a week, it is rare that I find a book thoroughly engaging in both substance and style.  The style is unusual and fascinating; the author does not &quot;write&quot; in the usual sense.   Klempner CONFIDES.  It is as if you were sitting in a chair across from  this author as he tells you the story, complete with &quot;inside  information&quot; and amusing asides.  In fact, the first paragraph of the  book begins this process and I was captivated by the author's intimacy with  the reader.  The plot is not very original but it is solid.  The ending is  a heart-tugger, completely in line with the aauthor's style.  I will  definitely read anything Klempner writes; reading his book has made me a  fan and a friend of his.	2000-06-06

The ending is so ridiculous and so morally  repugnant that it offends us in every area of our humanity: physical,  mental, emotional, and spiritual.

Jack Finney is probably best known for his story &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot; which was made into a movie and for his time travel adventure &quot;Time And Again&quot; which acquired a cult following.  But, as we can see in &quot;Three By Finney&quot; it is his unique imagination  that gives all of his stories a glow and a charm all their own.  Proof of  his gift is that his books have become movies.  One of the three stories in  this book, &quot;Marion's Wall&quot; was made into a movie called  &quot;Roxie&quot; that starred actress Glenn Close in the title role.   Roxie (&quot;Marion&quot; in the book) is a flapper whose movie career (in  the early days of Hollywood) was aborted by a car accident.  Roxie returns  as a ghost to take up where she left off and causes all kinds of fun and  confusion.  A second story is about time-travel again; &quot;The Woodrow  Wilson Dime&quot; is a tale of a man venturing back and forth in time and  you'll love the varying versions of his life that are caused by his travels  in time.  The last of the three stories is a fanciful account of the  adventures of two married couples who take to the streets of San Francisco  at night to do all kinds of mischief.  This story is so bizarre, funny, and  wild that only Finney could have thought of it.  Amazon lists a number of  books by Jack Finney and every one of them is a good read; naturally some  are better than others.  When you are a person who reads a lot, as I am,  and you find an author as gifted and interesting as Finney, you get the  feeling a prospector must have when he discovers a big pocket of gold.   Some authors - like the two people who wrote (separately) &quot;To Kill A  Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; - only wrote one book.   While you love those books, you are forever disappointed that the authors  never wrote more.  But an author like Finney, who left us with a number of  well-written, imaginative stories, is a mother-lode for those new readers  whohave not yet discovered him.	2000-03-25

Of course, if the aforesaid reporter did so there would be  much less of a book here, so maybe that provides the author with a  rationale for this ridiculous plot.  This author fails to realize that the  reading public not only wants to be entertained but also wants to see  outrageous behavior punished and criminals brought to justice.  That does  not happen in this novel.  Too bad someone cannot plot for this author  since he can write.  But to detail sick, offensive, disgusting crimes and  then to have the &quot;hero&quot; of the novel ignore his responsibility to  act is not only ludicrous; it is offensive.  I wish there was a way to  award &quot;minus stars&quot; to rate this book.	2000-03-23

The prose  is hell to read and the author succeeds in the almost impossible task of  making heinous murder boring. The reader may say to himself, as I did,  &quot;Reading this book is more difficult than ditch-digging,&quot; and I  (unlike most readers) know all the obscure words used.  The constant use of  italics is maddening.  The character of Davey Crockett comes across as a  cartoon.  If you like macabre novels, do yourself a favor and read H.P.

What a blast from the past!  And the price is  miniscule compared to the value.  I would've paid the price of the book for  the lyric to just one or two of the songs in this book.  In most cases each  song has its publishing date with the author(s) name alongside the title.   I was surprised that so many of the songs I've loved were first published  so long ago.

It's easy to see why since it not only has a plausible absorbing  story line, but the text is supplimented with photographs that lend an air  of authenticity to this journey into the past century.  Best of all, there  is a sequel to this book that I also enjoyed.
