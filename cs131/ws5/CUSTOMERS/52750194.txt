While he has an ear for dialogue, I kept getting lost in the plot and the relationship of the characters. I know this was supposed to be a funny book, but the protagonist was too much of a sad sack to invite any identification for the reader and the lines weren't snappy enough to get me laughing. Instead I felt sorry for \\"Lou\\" while not really liking her that much. I kept wanting to stop reading the book as it didn't seem to go anywhere in the plot. The ending confused me, as it did another reviewer. So my recommendation is pass on this one and try another of Wilcox, as the author seems to be quite popular.	2004-09-28

Beautifully written and plotted. What is most intriguing is what she leaves out, in order to circle that material back in, again and again - almost in the way that Faulkner used to circle round a story. She is able to show how the death of an individual continues to haunt and play itself out in the lives of the siblings. A most powerful book. Wonderful characters that I won't forget for a long time. Bravo, Ms. MacDonald for a job well done!	2002-08-10

His vivid descriptions of the jungle, the chaos of the refugees, the personal set against the background of the impersonality of war, and the way he ended the novel - all of it left me feeling very satisfied. He avoided the error of so many first time novelists -of tying everything up into a neat little package at the end. Instead, you are left with the sense that there is more to the journey. Perhaps there will be a sequel?	2002-07-26

At the end of the book, I was thoroughly satisfied because there was no false drama but rather an honesty, an integrity with which the author kept to the story. It's a book that invites you into the world of Scotland and World War II and the uncertainties of a young woman whose life was marked always by her mother's death. The restraint in the writing paralleled Eva's restraint about her contact with the dead. From one writer to another, I say, \\"Bravo, Margot Livesey!\\"	2002-02-24

She loves her characters and that shows. There is a kindness to them, even if they are awkward and socially misfit. She sees the good in people and how the little detail mirrors the big truths. I loved this book without qualification. The writing was excellent.	2002-02-10

At first, a bit difficult to get into, due to the punctuation or rather the lack of it, and then as a reader you let go and tumble into the lyrical flow of her words and images. What she is attempting, the merging of the decades of a woman's life in the end-of-life consciousness that slips from one period to another, works beautifully. It's a powerful, literary novel, one that I will definitely recommend to my writing colleagues.	2001-08-25

The author did a marvelous job of keeping the story fresh and suspenseful and that is not always easy to do with history. Her writing is crisp and her delightful descriptions of people and the times are peppered with a gentle humor. Underlying the whole story of the trainer, the jockey, and the owner is her appreciation of the nobility, competitiveness, and heart of this small, ungainly horse.

The writing is lush, lyrical, and music to my ears. Yes, I know her character of Deanna was probably too stereotypic and that the plot was close to that of the lesser &quot;The Loop&quot; but the real character in this book is the rush and passion of nature, the spring that bursts forth after a harsh winter, the summer lull into an acceptance of ourselves, pregnant now with new possibilities. The book was sheer delight to me.	2001-05-19

As a writer myself, I admire what the author is doing - in terms of time, style, and content. Some of his statements of his characters forced me to stop and think about how one's death is, at one and the same time, the definer of one's life and yet reduces us back into the grasses. He doesn't really intend for you to like, dislike, or empathize with the characters but rather with the moment of passing tenderness, the romantic impulse, because without death, his female protagonist proclaims, there would be no love, no art.	2001-05-19

Most of us are not willing to admit our foolishness but Duncan Sings-Alone understands the wily (and humiliating) nature of Old Man Coyote.

Jeffrey Lent is able to move into those ambiguous spaces between people and weave his words around  the wordlessness of their emotions. I found his stories of the first and  third generations most absorbing, whereas the second generation was a  reactive story - but what a read.

While most of live in the world of symbols, he points us to pay attention to signs and what happens when we  don't distinguish what we need from what we want. His autobiographical  tales, while making us laugh, also resonate with his renderings of the  archetypal stories of old man Coyote. I think Duncan, who also wrote The  Fractured Mirror:Healing Multiple Personality Disorder, is a natural born  teacher of old but forgotten truths.	2000-03-13

Her depiction of the relationship between the two sisters, so  understated in the dialogue, so finely crafted in the nuances, made this  book a real joy to read.

I kept looking for the reason behind the obscure  structure of the book. There are some powerful moments, especially toward  the end, when describing the violence that men have felt towards unfettered  women, but overall I was left disatisfied. This could have been a much more  powerful book if the reader hadn't had to struggle so hard to figure out  the histories of the characters.	2000-02-07

I don't know what I found so compelling about this book - the wonderful descriptions of the dangers of climbing or the awful egocentricity of the man in which he proffers guilt-laden compliments about his wife without  really coming across as knowing her, the rationalizations from which come  the &quot;addicted&quot; part of the title, but clearly here was man driven  by macho competition much to the detriment of his own emotional  development. If this book serves as an apology to his wife and children, it  lacks the insight - but the physical descriptions of climbing are  breath-taking.	1999-06-29

The lyrical power of Thornton's prose gets better and better with each new book. In this book, he follows the trail of the missing &quot;adopted&quot; children and the determined search of the grandmother from the time when so   many people disappeared, either killed  or kidnapped by the Argentinian  military - stories that began in his wonderful, earlier books: Imagining  Argentina and The Naming of the Spirits. There is a truthfulness to his  writing that bypasses logic and goes straight to the heart. I couldn't put  this book down. From one novelist to another, I want to congratulate  Thornton on producing some of the most powerful literature I have read in  the past few years.	1999-05-31

Sometimes it works beautifully and she is able to convey vividly their different perceptions of the Congo,  the missionary zeal, international politics, and the dismantling of a  family. Sometimes, it's hard to believe the point of view of the five year  old, but it's exciting to see the author experiment and bring the story  alive, keep the reader focused and involved, even with the rapid shifting  of viewpoints. All I can say, one novelist to another, is Bravo Barbara!  Well -done!	1999-05-02

This story, while it doesn't have the humor or chacters that shimmer (as in The Runaway), demonstrates the  style of writing for which Terry Kay is admired by other writers. The story  of the kidnaping of a nobody intrigued me most with the descriptions of the  place of imprisonment. The plot was mild but kept my interest. I like it  that Terry Kay is pushing himself into new areas.	1999-02-13
