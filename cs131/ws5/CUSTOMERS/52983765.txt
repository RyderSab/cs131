Suddenly I thought maybe the quality would be mediocre. That this would be some cranked out product just to make a buck. I was wrong. I listened to all 3 CD's (the 4th is a computer demo) and enjoyed the presentation highly.<br />Steve Jones is the person who gives presentation. I believe it is a recorded live process. What I liked about this alot is it covered all of the Franklin Covey time management principles in a very focussed manner (hence the title...??).<br />This CD series serves as an excellent refresher or introduction to the principles of managing your time. They introduce the time quadrants and explain in pretty good detail how to use paper, PDA or computer planners to manage your time. The sessions never bog down in any one area and they move from topic to topic at just about the right pace.<br />Obviously this CD set has some ties to the services and courses offered by Franklin Covey. They'd love it if you registered for the full course or bought a $200 planner/binder. However the course on tape/CD will standalone quite well. The speaker is clear and has a good delivery. I enjoyed this and found the time passed quickly (which doesn't always happen) as I was listening. Buy this - you won't be sorry!	2004-01-25

I was looking forward to this book which I purchased last year. After all it has an endorsement from Tony Robbins prominently displayed across the cover.<br />Unfortunately it proved to be a big let down. I actually threw it in the trash at the Gym this morning after only 107 pages (there are about 200 total).<br />I guess there isn't anything wrong here. Art recounts in some details about his accident which left him a quadriplegic. Most of what he describes has been written about umpteen times before and in bettter detail. He draws upon the old self-help war chestnuts about Thomas Edison and boats flashing each other signals to turn until one figures out the other light is from a lighthouse.<br />The problem with this book is that it didn't catch my interest at all. I was expecting an introduction about Art's accident and recovery - then some concepts and tips about overcoming adversity. Instead there was simply 107 pages of how the doctors treated him. How hard it was to push a wheelchair. How he felt awkward maneuvering his home.<br />Now admittedly - my review would be off target and maybe interpreted as cruel if the book had been titled &quot;How to recover from quadraplegia&quot; --- but this book is billed as self-help and it is anything but. It's bland. Covers the same tired concepts - with very little enthusiasm or flair.<br />Unless you have recently experienced a paralyzing accident - I think you'll be left scratching your head as I did mid-way through the book.	2004-01-22

Dr. Staples does a great job of portraying lots of success concepts without making his book seem one big long drawn out affair. He borrows quotes and tidbits heavily from other authors and I appreciated that. As I read the book I eagerly anticipate the snippits of information he'd insert (all very plainly attributed to the other authors).<br />The book is an easy read and captures most of the essential success concepts. It doesn't break a lot of new ground - and that was perfect. I found it to present some information in a brand new way that had me sitting up and taking notice.<br />As an example, in chapter 11 the author talks about three ways to persuade other people. The first way he mentions is a silly one that probably all of us have tried -- and it is to ignore people &quot;and simply hope they will act in your best interest&quot;. He goes on to elaborate that &quot;..by ignoring people you are giving up any hope of influencing them and thus surrendering yourself to the whims of fate&quot;.<br />It is little powerful bits of information like the above which made me glad I read this book. I'll definitely refer back to sections throughout the year. If you are serious about improving your life I think you'll enjoy this book a lot.	2003-10-13

The concept of letting go of thoughts and emotions is a basic yet powerful one.<br />I just got through reading this book and was delighted to see that it is not merely a transcript of the Sedona Method course. It provides a lot of insights and good solid written material and examples which serve as an excellent compliment to the basic course.<br />It has been very helpful to have some written material to backup that which is in the taped sessions.  While listening to the tapes I just didn't have enough time to be doing the exercises and also taking notes. This book serves perfectly as my notes on the course. It is a great companion and refresher on the concepts of the Sedona Method.<br />Also, if you have been considering attending or buying the Sedona Method course - you should really check out this book as it gives complete and in-depth information about the course. This is not just a teaser book that constantly admonishes you to get to the course to learn more. This gives the actual material that is in the course which costs a couple hundred dollars at least.<br />This has been an exceptionally useful concept to me which I rate as somewhere between meditation and self-help. Well worth a look for anybody seeking to improve their thoughts and actions.	2003-08-31

It's one of the few books that I have been interested enough in to stay with and finish within 2 days. I found myself unable to put it down.<br />Now don't get me wrong - the information here is nothing earth shattering. A lot of it is tried and true principles that have been around for many hundreds of years. What makes this book work is the delivery and writing style. It presents goal setting in a clear, understandable and very useable fashion.<br />If you are into goal setting I think you'll find yourself referring to this book again and again. I know I have and recommend it highly.	2003-08-24

Never much for exercise I picked this book up, lost a bunch of weight and changed my eating and exercising habits forever.<br />I find it very simple to stay within the guidelines of the book -- it does require a 360 degree change in your thinking and how you eat. Out goes the fast food and junk food -- in comes balanced meals.<br />If there is any portion of this program that I have difficulty with it is the weight training -- I seems to have some difficulty finding the correct starting weight so that by the time I've increased my weights and done all the repetitions my arm's aren't hanging to the floor.<br />There is a fantastic companion journal that you will want to get to record all of your planned meals and exercises.<br />Yes, this book does push supplements to some degree. So what. The advice seems to work -- at least it did for me. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to make a change in their life fitness. It really is not as hard as it might seem.	2002-12-14

I've used the Journal that is available through the EAS web site and there are many difference between the two. This journal has inspirational comments and stories for every day. There is space for recording all meals and workouts (both weight and aerobic).<br />The journal definitely needs to be paired with the book unless you are an expert in the exercises and diet recommendations. There is not enough information in this journal for someone who is not knowledgeable about BFL to formulate a plan -- you must have the book or advanced BFL knowledge to use this journal (the EAS journal includes a condensed version of the book and you could use THAT journal almost all by itself).<br />This is an important enough program that you should get both the book and the journal to help in your program. The advice is very common sense and this journal will help you greatly in achieving your goals.	2002-11-30

I think the book reads a little more like a transcription of a seminar that was given. Most of what I took away from the Sedona Method is that you should &quot;Release&quot; and it seems to be completely based on asking if you &quot;Could let it go&quot;.... There is obviously more to this method that just letting go -- however throughout their tape set this is the dominant theme. I applaud the organization for being able to create a whole tape and seminar series around this concept. Probably not an idea for everyone, however I must admit to enjoying listening to the entire Sedona Method seminar on disk - although it seems to work best as a meditation series versus something you can listen to while driving in the car.	2002-11-02

This CD set is nice because there are individual programs on each CD. At least one of the CD's contains a whole program of short sayings and affirmation read by Dr. Dyer.

Then I started to listen to his message and the ideas and concepts sank in. An awful lot of material is common sense and borrowed from other's ideas --- but what success literature isn't?<br />The things that you might find useful about Brian Tracy are:<br />- The ideas are all concise and to the point. These are easy reads and you don't get a lot of extraneous storytelling or religious fanaticism.<br />- His audio tapes mirror his writing. They are concise and contain many powerful yet simple concepts (How about his concept of repeating \\"I am responsible\\" over and over -- simple huh? Could never work, right? Try it!). Some of Brian's simplest concepts work great.<br />This particular book, Create Your Own Future, is almost a transcript of his great tape series - The Luck Factor. This is a great opportunity to get a nice written summary of Brian's ideas after listening to the tapes. I really enjoy that he has broken up the ideas into short manageable bits.<br />Give his books a try. They contain all of the success \\"secrets\\" in an easily readible format. Highly recommended (I have almost all of them).	2002-09-11

This is an interesting book that is laced with recommendations that you may be tempted to initially dismiss. Get up and get into the office early / spend 9-5 in front of the customer and do your paperwork outside of normal working hours. However the writing style is as if you are listening to the author tell his story. It is simle to read and relate to all of his examples concerning his work with the Xerox office that he took from worst to first.<br />Books like this that serve to reinforce the basics are invaluable - especially when they are an entertaining and interesting read. This book is both entertaining and interesting while also giving a healthy dose of solid advice.	2002-08-31

They are essentially the audio portions of his video program.<br />I own a number of Wayne Dyer tape sets and this CD compilation is a bargain. It contains his best material at about 90% off what you could pay to purchase his larger tape sets.<br />One of the attractions of Wayne Dyer to me is not his advice - which borrows heavily from other self-help gurus - but his delivery combined with his own personal stories. He relies heavily on discussion of his personal background from being in an orphanage to being divorced and dealing with the absence of his father since birth.<br />Wayne Dyers books have weathered the passing of time. His popularity may have been greatest in the late 70's - however his message is still crystal clear for anyone who wishes to listen and learn.	2002-08-25

I thought he did a fabulous job. Very entertaining and his message was right on with a lot of entertaining stories.<br />I wish that I could tell you the same thing about his book. I did like that the end of each chapter had a nice summary. Unfortunately most of the text borrows heavily from other success literature. It is a rather dry read with few memorable examples.<br />For someone new to the success area, this does give you a lot of information. However if you've read the popular books that are out there - this will likely serve as a re-hash of their concepts.	2002-06-26

Prior to reading the book, my idea of a balanced meal was a burger, fries and diet coke.<br />Many of the concepts in the book are a little daunting at first. When I started following the ideas I had charts showing me the exact proportion of fat-carb-protein. Too confusing for my simple mind- I soon switched to Sears' recommendation of using one fist sized portion of protein to two fist-sized portions of favorable carbohydrates.<br />I've begun following his advice on Omega 3, although I most admit that I purchased the cheaper Omega 3 which he sells on his zoneperfect site...and it is significantly more convenient to buy online which eliminates frequent searches of the store shelves.<br />I also love the ZonePerfect bars which can be purchased quite cheaply on sale (and at some of the wholesale clubs).<br />The end result of my focus on diet? 30lb weight loss in about 4 months. This was helped along by a regular exercise plan.<br />I strongly recommend this book even if you only use it as a kicking off point for upgrading your diet.	2002-06-05

Each one covers a specific company and has 4 or 5 paragraphs about what went wrong and how silly the concept of the company was to start with. Shipping 50lb bags of dog food and door-to-door delivery of $1 candy bars stand out as two classic \\"what were they thinking\\" company ideas.<br />This is a quick read with short chapters.

He starts off one of his segments by telling a story where he jokingly admits he is a &quot;Quack&quot;.

First I should say that I am not exactly an independent reviewer in respect to this book as I participate in the annual survey that Sheldon Needles does. As a consultant for the MAS90 accounting software package, this is one publication I read cover-to-cover as soon as it is released. It is packed with inside information you may not be able to learn elsewhere.<br />What this book gives me is a glimpse as what other consultants are saying about the products that they represent. The comments in the book are all anonymous with the only identity being the state where the consultant is located. Because Sheldon tallys all the results, you can be certain that the people submitting comments are actual consultants for the products and not competitors with a grudge.<br />The book has comments on about a dozen of the leading software packages. These comments range from the glowing 1 sentence variety to the half page detailed description of what is right or wrong with the accounting package the particular consultant offers.<br />This is a good purchase for anyone involved in looking for a new accounting system. The different packages covered here are really limited to the market leaders like Great Plains, Solomon, MAS90, Navision, Accpac, etc. There is not extensive coverage of smaller packages like QuickBooks or Peachtree --- primarily because not many people use consultants to help with those packages.<br />For the small cost of this survey (which is updated every year) you can gain some very helpful insight into almost all of the major accounting systems.	2001-05-10

The coach goes in and shoots the most basic and fundamental shot in basketball  - the easy layup.  And says -- see that shot --- 99% of games are won on  that shot. Don't ever miss it!<br />That story perfectly sets the stage for  what this book is about. You find yourself using the Sales Bible as a great  reminder about the fundamentals of sales.<br />A solid addition to your sales  library.	1999-02-28
US	52983765	R1G8IUD00FABEW	0965953653	533121432	Successful QuickBooks Software Consulting	Books	5	10	11	N	Y	Great Book For ANY Consultant	Although this book is titled  Successful QuickBooks Consulting, I think the principles in the text are equally appropriate to many other area's of consulting.<br />As someone who does computer consulting for a living - I  especially enjoyed that this is a &quot;no-fluff&quot; book. It doesn't  spend time telling you what you already know. Rather it reads as if it is a  compilation of &quot;best practices&quot; in the computer consulting  industry.<br />One of my all time problems has been end users who call in with  quick &quot;one second&quot; questions. The authors correctly point out  that while the question lasts only one second, the answer seldom does. And  they include a fantastic sample fax that can be used to inform those  looking for free advice that the meter is going to start running.<br />Top  management consultants would charge many times the cost of this book just  to provide you with essentially the same advice on how to setup your  consulting practice.<br />Highly recommended book. It would be especially  useful for any CPA firms looking to set up computer consulting divisions.	1999-02-10

I had just purchased a Palmpilot to replace my Zaurus and was looking for a comprehensive introduction to my new machine.  This book provided everything I was looking for. It contains a top to bottom overview of the Palmpilot (which is about 1/2 the book) and the remaining half fo the book is devoted to providing information on 3rd party applications.  I think you could probably go look in a bunch of different Internet sites and find this info --- but why bother when it is all right here in the book.  I especially liked the fact that there are tons of Internet web site links that are mentioned -- so if you need further information you know where to jump to.  In summary, a great book for the new user of the Palmpilot. Highly recommended.	1998-01-26

The idea about \\"thankyouverymuch\\" changed my whole way of thinking about cold calls -- and instantly raised the number of calls I was able to make. I actually look forward to making these followup calls after having gone through Bill's book. Thankfully this book doesn't go over any of the tired old tips that others may discuss such as how to be pushy on the phone or how to get past gatekeepers. Bill's whole philosophy is that if someone doesn't want to talk to you then you should hit the flash button and be on to the next prospect as soon as possible.	1997-12-11

Books	5	1	2	N	Y	Must have companion to the Personal Power (I/II) Tape Sets	A great summary of everything that is on Robbin's tapes. I found it better than the Success Journal that came with the $200 set of tapes.  It is hard to think that if you followed through (took action) on these ideas that some part of your life wouldn't be permanently changed for the better.<br /><br />This would be a great book for someone thinking about buying the tapes but not quite sure.  Read the book and if you buy into the concepts the tapes are a great way to reinforce.	1997-02-03

First things first is also a good book to get for time management. Only criticism is that Covey's voice doesn't transfer very well to tape -- I have to stick with the book	1997-02-03
