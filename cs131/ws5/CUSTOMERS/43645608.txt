Everything about it is so interesting, and still realistic. Jessica Wakefield falls head-over-heels for Michael McAlley, despite all the warnings everyone has given her. She does something very big in this book, which I won't spoil, but you'll be surprised. Anyway, Mike and her have a very intense relationship, but she catches him with many other women and gets suspicious. Steven and Billie who live upstairs from Mike talk abotu Jessica and Mike's relationship a lot. Steven goes balistic. Elizabeth Wakefield is dealing with fitting in. Her ex-boyfriend, Todd Wilkins recently dumped her, and Tom Watts has a crush on her. But she's worried about her weight. This part in the book was very realistic. I am thin, and don't have weight problems, but while reading it the pain she was going throyugh with not having to eat such delicious food was very well written. It was so well-written I literally felt her pain. Even though I don't have weight issues and am in great shape, while reading I felt like I was worried about eating to much sweets. I totally felt for her. Todd Wilkins and Tom Watts, who are rivals both love Elizabeth. Tom and Liz work on a story for the WSVU news, but it may effect someone close to her. Meanwhile, William White, whom Celine loves is totally into Elizabeth. His obsession with her is way above normal. Anyway, back to Jessica and Mike. Jessica and Mike grow extremely close, and she does soemthing very, very big that will change her life forever. You will enjoy this book and I reccomend it to anyone. This book is great!	2001-07-09

Finn wants to sleep with Elizabeth, but Elizabeth feels she's not ready. Finn puts a lot of pressure on Liz, and makes her confused. Finn becomes a real jerk and does something really, really cruel to Liz. I felt so bad for her. Sam tries to protect Liz, because he knows that Finn dates girls, sleeps with them, then dumps them. Sam wants her to ditch Finn, and tries so many ways to get her to, but she thinks he's lying. ALso, Sam refers to Finn as Huckleberry Finn and Dr. Cool, which gets amusing and funny. This book also speaks about all the risks of sex, and the diseases and stuff. i will not tell you if Liz loses her virginity that night or not, you'll have to find out for yourself. I will not say what cruel thing Finn does, but he does something really, really cruel. Also, Nina Harper dates Xavier, a member of the band Wired. Todd works really hard at his job, but everybody calls him a \\"townie\\". The Neil finding a new love, and Jessica disagreeing with it is barely mentioned though. It's very sad what Finn does to liz, and it's really cruel. But Elizabeth makes the right decision. Her feelings on this are really realistic, but I wish she'd seen through him before. Anyway, this book is great!	2001-07-08

For instance, the SVU books were written before Olivia Davidson died, so Olivia Davidson is at the reuinion, even though she's suppose to be dead, and Liz is talking to her a lot. Also, a few of the memories didn't exist. ANyway, this book is really good. Mike does something really increadible for Jessica, which you'll have to read in order to find out. Todd and Tom have a lot of controversity, but you'll have to read it to find out who wins Elizabeth's heart. Also, Jessica confesses the whole story to her parents. How will they react? Read it to find out! Also, they have a high school reunion, and Olivia Davidson, who's suppose to be dead is in it. It's mildly amusing how some of the people and memories that are mentioned didn't exist. This is a really great book. Even if you've never celebrated Chrismas you'll like it. This book is great!	2001-07-06

It deals with serious issues, and I reccomend it to anyone. Jessica Wakefield, who was assulted by her former boyfriend, James Montgomery, is wondering what she should do about it.

Elizabeth totally supports her, as do Steven and Billie. Also, her former husband, Michael McAllery says a few kind words to her. Anyway, Jessica deals with the fact that James almost raped her, and hopes that people will believe her. Meanwhile, Alexandra Rollins fidns love on the campus hotline, little does she know who he really is. Lila and Bruce fall madly in love and are rescued. Anyway, back to the Jessica/James trial. It was so beautiful! The way Jessica felt confident was so wonderful! And when Maia testified, I was so proud of her. Also, the march was awesome! The way it built up Jessica's confidence was great. The trial was awesome, too. This book deals a lot with date rape and sexual assualt. Jessica and Maia helped save a lot of people. Also, Mike McAllery is so sweet to Jessica.
