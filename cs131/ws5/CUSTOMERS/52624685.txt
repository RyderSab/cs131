Maybe something that would  <br />generate a signal when a player is approaching?  Unfortunately there is  <br />no such device, but all is not lost. Mark Crutcher shares some invaluable  <br />information, and generates some insight on the games men play.   <br />  <br />What Mr. Crutcher does is break down the player's mentality into three  <br />skill levels, and shares the characteristics and the signals of each level.  <br />With short stories, he gives a wide-angle view of the process a player uses.  <br />The book is frank, candid, and at times almost woeful though not really  <br />in a negative sense. While reading, I began to realize  <br />that women do have a built in warning system. We may not get warning <br />bells but, we do get a certain resonance which should produce a strategy  <br />to nullify the game. But too often we fail to heed the warning;  <br />each woman thinks she is the exception not the rule. The points shared  <br />in this book shuld change our perception or at least increase our awareness. <br />He shares the objective of a player and he shares his personal pain when  <br />the woman he loved walked out of his life; without any warning. Since then, <br />he has vowed to never cause another woman the pain that he felt. This  <br />book is the first step in his healing process and possibly a cleansing of  <br />his spirit. <br />  <br />Checkmate: The Games Men Play analyzes a man's psyche from his first  <br />hello and intimates that the game really begins once a man has scored.  <br />I applaud Mr. Crutcher for this enlightening heads up; it is much  <br />appreciated. But I would like to offer this author a suggestion,  <br />if partly in jest. I suggest you keep your head up and an occasional  <br />lookout; for you have shared some valuable trade secrets and an inside view  <br />of a player's mind. Ladies thisis an excellent book to read <br />if you're tired of the games.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-03

Storyline was so good, the fact that they both were nuturing 2 year old emotions made this more realistic.  This book showed how misconceptions can mess things up for you, if we would simply share what we feel regardless of  anything else.  I liked how Trevor felt Corinthians deserved more than what  they initially shared,  now that's a man after my own heart. It was a treat  to visit with the Madaris family again.

She was still wearing scars from an abusive  marriage.  While this didn't sizzle quite  as much as the other books, the  story was just as tender, more so, because Trent and Dominique had to  overcome her trauma. Trent was the right temperment for her.

Quinn's  acceptance of himself was a long time coming.  I liked Nikita and Maxine  and Quinns' relationship with them was an example of what it means to Love  someone and to be In Love with someone.

I'm beginning to like Rosalyn's works, she depicts relaitonships, that women so often base on good sex.  The female characters  appear weak and at first I thought her characers were under developed, but  as I read closer I realized there is too much truism to her characters.   This book makes me think we give up way too much power, it's a little  unnerving. She does not write fairy tales. Read it for yourself. I liked  it.	1999-03-02

I felt a certain tenderness for how Colin expressed the sweet side of manhood, rarely do we get the feel of male emotions.  Fire was a sensitive man, who relied on the  feelings of his soul.  The reading was a little slow in sections, because I  was  not familiar with the dialect and I had to reread.  But, it made the  book more authentic, kinda of how it would be if I were to visit Jamaica,  actually at one point I got the feeling I was there.  Sadly realistic, it  showed the shallowness of relationship when we are afraid to follow our  souls feelings.  Colin, thank you for rekindling the me inside.	1999-02-25

Poignant, warm, forgiving, frustrating, you name it, you felt it.  It was real friendship, no holds barred, and the most understanding love.  Read  this book.	1999-02-19

Being familiar with Misty and Reesy from &quot;Scenes&quot;, this book made them more than characters,  Lolita has outdone herself with this sequel.   The growth of these two was so real and  they acted like REAL friends act, the 'good', the 'bad' and the 'ugly'.   But they were always there for each other, they make this book so  enjoyable.  My hat goes off to Dandre, he was quite a guy, his actions  helped make Reesy faced herself.  It was just Too Good.  A must read.   Lolita this was great.	1999-02-18

Blessings was very entertaining and very real,  the life on any one of the main characters was a story in itself. This book covered so many of the trials of just plain living.  I must admit I was a little surprised at how  things turned out for  Zuma, I understand her decision, and again that's  life, but I was surprised. This my second novel by Ms Jackson, (Li'l Mama's  Rules) but were worth the cost.	1999-02-12

Though Reesy had a rough exterior, that was her defense mechanism, she was indeed a friend.  Because of their different personalites, you wondered about the  two of them being friends.  But, the differences are what made the  freindship so great.  Misty was the stability Reesy needed, she was so  volatile.  But the love they had for each other is what made this book so  good.  I just finished reading 'Getting To The Good Part' so, I had to come  back and do my review of 'Scenes'.  The sequel 'GTTGP' is a must read,  Lolita knows how to do a sequel.  This is so good, Reesy almost out does  herself, with a penmanship spun expertly by Ms Files.	1999-02-09

'GTTGP', was awesome, this is the continuing tale of two of the best friends I've ever read about. Lolita has mastered, in only 2 outings, the art of exposing the full gamut of a warm, genuine, sometimes  strained but very real friendship.  This is just to real, she kept Misty  and Dandre and especially Reesy human, you really believed this story.   Ms  Reesy's, 'hurtful payback' attitude nearly destroys friendship and a  serious love interest.  The dialoge is hilarious, the characters are well  developed, and the story is just great. I would suggest if you can, read  'Scenes from a Sistah' first, it will increase your appreciation for this  book.  For you new writers, if you want to know how to do a sequel,  that's  'ALL THAT' this is the mold.  Jenean, you were right.	1999-02-04
US	52624685	RLPZQKF92O32U	0671872001	831608724	Disappearing Acts	Books	5	0	0	N	N	I liked this book.	Disappearing Acts, is a touching journey to what happens when you let someone in your heart.  Zora, was looking for order and stability, but she stumbled across Franklin.  What do you do when someone rocks your world?   Logic and common sense fight a tough fight.  When you're in control of your  feelings it's so easy to do the proper thing, but when your heart leads  look out. McMillan describes emotions like few others can. Franklin was  quite a character but he knew it and he was struggling to right himself.   This book was real no matter how much it angered you, Zora reacted the way  most women in love do. We see what we want to see, and we're nuturers,  that's just the way it is.  Of all Terry's books,I liked this one best.	1999-02-02

After reading 'Lil Mama's Rules', I thought how often we fail to appreciate an honest man.  Though Madison had serious problems because of her father or lack thereof, she expected something from Chirs, that she  didn't give, perfection.  Chris' action cannot be condonned, but he was  honest, she kicked him to the curb, and then proceeded to believe the lies  almost every other man told her, go figure.  She should have been more  honest with herself.  Her sexual philosophy and her sexual promiscuity were  not realistic.  When you're as reckless as she was, you have to take care  of business.  I like Jackson's writing I will definitely read more of her  works.	1999-02-02

'ITWWM', is the first book of E Lynn Harris, that I've read, I found it to be very thought provoking and quite intense.  The lives of 4 friends and how they shared the harsh realities of life was the bases for this story.    The characters were believable and the storyline was good.  I did not know  Basil from Harris' other works, but I started to understand his dilema as  the book progressed.  And, I felt his suffering more than the other  characters.  Harris allowed us to see people as just human beings, opposed  to 'straight, gay or bisexual' people. I must confess, this book will make  me take a different look at men. Not in a negative or sterotypical way,  just with more scrutiny.  I do like Harris' writing style.	1999-02-02
US	52624685	RNV5Q6RBAVK2N	0684838346	17180593	The Itch	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Paianfully realistic.	'The Itch', was a a candid look at relationships in the 90's.  The main female characters again show how important it is to have a shoulder to lean on.  Little, paints a sad, but realistic picture of life and the pursuit of  that seemingly unreachable love.  What was a little odd was the break up of  the Abra's marriage, had no warning signs, and I couldn't quite figure her  relationship with her producer.  Natasha handled the break up with Miles in  a grande fashion, I was glad she let go with style and class.  Would like  to have known where Miles' head was as he was leaving.  I would recommend  reading this.	1999-02-01

This book covered almost all of todays issues, which didn't allow for  complete development of some issues and characters.  But the main  character(Ava) and the predominant issue(her being HIV+) were touched on in  a surprisinly candid way.  The story is about how she learned to deal with  the consequence of her mis-directed  living.  She regretted never having  experienced love, and her disbelief and fear when she found it was  poignant.  This story made you realize everything has a purpose and that  timing is everything.  The finality of HIV, is what took her home to just  live out her life, but it ultimately gave her her first look at caring for  other people and the reality of love and loving.  I loved the line about  Ava and Eddie growing up.  An extremely good read.	1999-01-29

I loved it again	After recently reading 'Friends and Lovers' and 'Milk in my Coffee', I felt the urge to reread 'Sister,Sister', and I loved it again.  Warm, poignant and so real.  The trails, and expectations of everyday living were  so prevalent, it made me give serious thought to people and how we relate.  Inda had me stomping my feet and laughing, but she was telling it like it  is.  I'm glad Chiquita realized Raymond was a 'Pie Dog' and that she  deserved better.  EJD subtly imports the important role that family or lack  there of, plays in our lives. And in the three books we see positive career  minded brothers and sisters, awesome.  At some point in all of his books he  no longer has characters, but what feels like people, like family or  friends.  And that is where Eric excels, that's part of the mystery of his  penmanship.  I love how the couples he puts together, fit like a puzzle,  they seem to have the same karma. Your descripitons are so vivid, you have  me wanting to go to 5th Street Dicks to lizten to jazz.  I can hardly wait  for July, to see what has happened in everyone's life.  Please keep the  press rolling.       EJD, YOU ARE ALL THAT AND A BAG OF CHIPS.	1999-01-28

No that's not a description of 'MIMC' that's a description of EJD, he's all that .  Now on to 'Milk', this book was just great, the storyline was real and the people true to life.  I  thought the characters were very believable, and again Eric showed in this  his third outing, how screwy our lives get when we fail to COMMUNICATE.   The main characters Jordan and Kimberly, were just looking for someone to  feel and fill the void. And when that void filled, they then had the arduos  task of deciding if they could afford to keep it. It show how unrestrictive  our hearts are and why we still have a long ways to go in the department of  human beings.  This was not my favorite topic, but it was tastefully done,  and by mid book, Kimberly's race was no longer an issue in my head.  The  romance was more sensous than sexual and that's one thing about E's books  that pull you in.   For those who read Friends&amp;Lovers, did you catch  where Kimberlys' husband worked and where Jordan was going to work?  I'll  be in line at the book store in July, to pick up 'Cheaters'.  Eric, Please  keep them coming.	1999-01-21

I was completely in awe at the positivness of Leonard and Tyrel. They were such caring and respectful men, that's what won me over.  They loved the ladies now, but they were nice, decent guys  AND both wanted a one on one relationship.  I think we (females) tend to  think that's not the case sometimes.  About the couples: Leonard and Debra  knew this is what they wanted and weren't afraid to finalize, they were a  little more mature.  Tyrel and Shelby, a lot more physical knew the same  thing, but were both petrified of anything binding they had always had  relationships with escape clauses. Which is what led Shelby to panic, and  react like she did, but in her defense that's all she knew how to do. I  loved the relationship between the two sets of best friends.  After reading  this book I wondered what the characters are doing now.  I had to tell  myself these were not people, just characters, I'm still trying to convice  myself of that.  The male / female perspective, was a rare occurence, I  think Mr. Dickey has hit on something BIG.  It doesn't get better than  this. KEEP THEM COMING.	1999-01-15

I found the relationship between them so true it was comical.  They were so frank and somtimes hard on each  other, but behind all of the differences they cared for each other.  I was  glad to see that the men in the lives of the three sisters, were not  chasing other women and were not abusive.  Kevin and Vernon did not handle  old love interest in the best way, but they were both genuinely honest.   Charmaine needed to kick Clarence to the curb.  The ending was a little  soft.  I would have love to visit again with Vernon and Beverly.  But I  thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I also read and enjoyed 'Big Girls  Don't Cry'.	1999-01-14
