It teaches us with &quot;easy to understand no jargons&quot; language. And to illustrate the ideas better the books use lots of photos. There are lots of tips that are easy to remember, techniques to experiment. Reading the sections on exposure , film, and filters help me improve on my understanding on technical sides of photography. Should be a good starting book before moving on to more advance photography books. <br />I also recommend &quot;Kodak Guide to 35 mm&quot;,&quot;Kodak Guide to Point and Shoot Photography&quot; and &quot;Understanding Exposure&quot;.	2004-05-27

I used to wonder how people play the piano and envy them. Now after reading this book I can play several songs and am able to read music notes. Of course nothing beats a good live piano teacher, but this book gives you a good headstart. I give 4 stars instead of five since there are only ten lessons ( I wish for more).	2002-06-27

Two reasons: low cost, and wealth of information. This book will help any budding amateur astronomer to navigate the sky with skills and confident. One will learn the constellations, the messiers, and how to identify them with confident. I used this book myself, aside from developing skills to identify, I also developed (throughout time) the ability to estimate the star magnitude. I'd recommend this book together with Chet's &quot;Night Sky&quot; and Terrence Dickinson's &quot;Night Watch&quot;. I give this book 4 stars due to: 1) lack of beautiful illustration which might not very helpful if you want to introduce astronomy to young children 2) lack of intellectually stimulating essays (unlike Chet's book)<br />Other than that this book is a very good book for amateur astronomy.	2001-07-02

Each of them highlights what can be seen with the naked eyes throughout the year in the northern hemisphere. Together with the maps Chet includes commentaries and tips on how to identify planets,stars, and constellations.   Unlike few other sky guide books that merely teaches star hopping, Chet tries to stimulate readers imagination; inviting them to journey into the unseen and unperceivable, to marvel at the modern physics and be awed by the ancients wisdom. This book will sustain anyone's interest in astronomy for a long time.	2001-07-02

While in college I was programming on PC using assembly language, C, Pascal on DOS. When I worked I move on to Unix , programming and doing computer animation. After years on Unix, I feel that programming on PC is somewhat alien. So many has changed and a lot has to be re-learned and unlearned.  &quot;The Essence of COM&quot; has filled in the gap, good book for anyone who needs to catch-up with the technology quickly. The reason it does not get a 5 star is that at times the sentences need to be edited by an english teacher (of course he/she must understand COM first).	2001-06-18

I must say that this book does help a lot in making the installation easy. The only thing that one must do extra work is when installing the linux on newer machines (especially with the Windows Me already running). I just wish that Bill McCarty does a little more elaboration on /dev files and troubleshooting.  Anyway it is a good book.	2001-03-08

Nonetheless others with enthusiasm, and willingness to experiment would find that this book is unique and excellent in its approach . What makes this book as an excellent introductory reading, is that it comes with kit. Once you've read about stiquito, you can go ahead and build one for yourself. What kind of stiquito personality you want to build will depend on your creativity and willingness to experiment. It also teaches you how to write program to control simple robot using easy to get resources. Robotic is fun indeed.	2001-03-08

Instead you should read another one on the same subject. This however does not meant that this is not a good book. Instead a better one to learn robotic for everyone regardless of their technical background (some enthusiasm, some thinking, patience, preserverance are needed needless to say).

Before reading this book the only soviet space personalities that I knew were Yuri Gagarin and Valentina Tereshkova. I guess I am not alone on this. Reading this book gives me an understanding that Russian space program went back much earlier than that of American.  A lot of useful information about Russian space science and program, and its aspiration can be gained from this single book. This book talks a lot about Korolev, it also give good exposition on Soviet space program. One may wonder why Korolev has never been a household name like Gagarin, and how come the American is the first one landed on the moon.	2001-03-08

I've never been interested in history before I read this book. This book taught history in such a way that you will realize that past is important to move forward. I read it with the same enthusiasm I always have for good fiction. A must read for anyone who wonder how the USA become a major power broker in the world.	2001-03-08

But the codes are not that reliable. While the authors do provide codes to implement concepts discussed, some of the codes does not even compiled. For those that compiled some of it does not tackle the problem that it should tackle. Further editing and rewriting required.	2001-03-08

Most of the Windows programming books will teach you MFC and maybe a little of system call (which is usually of negligible usefulness). This one exposes the inner working of Windows system. Many of the system calls in this book can also be used for Windows 9x despite the name Windows NT (cool!). The style is easy to follow. Perfect for people with C++ knowledge, and Unix programmers who want to learn Windows system programming.	2001-03-08

No other super computing companies / personalities can rival his achievement (name one that survives more than 3 decades). This book chronicles the life and time of Seymour Cray.

Partly because I am always fascinated by the personality of RPF. After reading the book I can say that I look forward for other works by Gleick.  This is simply the best biography on RPF. It potrays the life and time of RPF, highlighting a lot milestone in the modern science in the process. Believe me , you'd want to know RPF in person once you finish reading this.	2001-03-08

Before Unix became a proprietary OS, its source code was available freely, hence the codes were used by many OS courses in colleges. Then things changed and the source code is no longer free. OS books will only present theories but not enough source code to show the implementation. This book is different. The authors took an extra initiative to create Minix which implements many features of Unix (and Linux) and include it into this book. I believe that this is a very good book to study OS in depth. It is reasonable that some mind stretching is needed as the subject of OS is sophisticated and complex. Highly recommended especially for Linux and Unix devotees.	2001-02-25
