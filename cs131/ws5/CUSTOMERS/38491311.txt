Memoirs of a Rogue<br />Mark Haeuser<br />The name of Brae the Mercenary is legendary. He loves wine, women and adventure - and not necessarily in that order. His skill with the women is just as famous as is his expertise with his sword. He loves all women - and he loves all of them well. But will any one woman ever capture Brae's heart?<br />Memoirs of a Rogue tells the story of Brae's adventures as he travels the known world selling his sword to the highest bidder. Both men and women will love reading this action/adventure romance novel. Every man will fantasize about being Brae. Every woman will fantasize about bedding Brae.<br />The steam literally rises from the pages of Memoirs of a Rogue. The love scenes are written with a sensitivity that I have rarely seen before. This doubly intrigues me due to the fact that a man writes it. It is interesting to read these sex scenes from a man's point of view.<br />I highly recommend Memoirs of a Rogue. The author, Mark Haeuser, has a natural talent for writing ultra-sensual romance. I hope to see many more books of this type from him. I do believe he has found his niche.<br />Reviewed by Kristie Leigh Maguire<br />Author of Desert Heat, Emails from the Edge, and co-author of No Lady and Her Tramp...	2003-07-29

Reviewed by: Kristie Leigh Maguire,<br />I knew that \\"Rough as a Cob\\" was not going to be the normal book from the moment I opened that manila envelope, pulled the book out and saw the outhouse on the cover. Then as I was thumbing through the pages and saw the chapter entitled, Listen, Listen, The Cat is Pissin, my first impression that this was indeed a most unusual book was reinforced.<br /><br />I had a real problem in reading \\"Rough as a Cob\\". Not because it was a bad book. It wasnt. No, my problem in reading it was because it is extremely difficult to read with tears rolling down your face from laughing so hard. My warning to the reader: Do NOT read this book in a library or any other place that requires silence. It will be impossible to read Rough as a Cob without cracking up with laughter. Ed Williams just keeps on rolling out those hilariously funny stories without any relief in sight. This is one of the funniest books that I have ever read.<br /><br />Since I am a romance writer as well as a reviewer, I believe that I enjoyed reading Eds romance chapter, 'Sally the Screamer, the most. As Ed said, A good love story just cant be beat. You will just have to read this chapter to truly appreciate a good love story  Ed Williams style.<br /><br />My next favorite chapter was Snake in the Cobs!. This chapter will fill you in on all you ever wanted to know about bathroom equity  or as Ed says, Bathroom equity can lead to some very serious consequences. Now I know why Ed named this book \\"Rough as a Cob\\".<br /><br />Lewis Grizzard was my all time favorite Southern humorist. Ed Williams has now been added to my very short list of Southern humorists that I admire and enjoy. Who knows? He just may become my favorite if he keeps cranking out books like his first novel, \\"Sex, Dead Dogs and Me\\" and \\"Rough as a Cob\\".	2003-05-17

The only thing that brought her back now was the suicide death of her beloved brother, Josh.<br />Shelly was soon to discover that the brother she thought she knew and had idolized existed only in her mind. After her return to Oak Valley from New Orleans, she began to discover things about him that just could not be true.<br />Old flames die hard.

The setting for In His Corner is during the sixties, an era of change and unrest amongst the youthful population of the United States - even those in a small town in the South.<br />Jane Moss was a young naive Southern girl who yearned for a change, for something different from the small town life where everyone knew everyone else and made it their business to help them stay on the straight and narrow. Shortly after her high school graduation, Jane moved to the big city of Atlanta. Her life was filled with work, shopping and friends - and trying to pretend that she wasn't really the innocent little small town girl that everyone thought she was. Life for Jane in downtown Atlanta was exciting, much different than life in the little town of Overton. Then she literally bumped into Billy Joe Billingsley on the dance floor at Kitten's Korner on Peachtree Street - and her life changed forever.<br />Billy Joe Billingsley was considered a juvenile delinquent amongst the town folk of Overton, Georgia - despite the fact that his family was a prominent one in the area. He had fallen in with the wrong crowd and had gotten caught committing the \\"heinous crime\\" of stealing hubcaps. Since he had just turned eighteen, he was sent to prison. When he was released, he returned home but he just did not fit in anymore. He soon left for greener pastures.<br />Billy Joe was older than Jane and definitely not boyfriend material for such an innocent young girl - but try telling that to Jane. She had met her soul mate and nothing, not even her family disowning her, was going to stop her from seeing Billy Joe. Life with Billy Joe was filled with traveling from one place to another in the South. Jane suspected that something was just not right about the \\"distribution business\\" that Billy Joe was involved in but she closed her eyes to it and pretended everything was on the up and up. After all, they were in love and that made everything all right - didn't it?<br />Joan Moore Lewis has the true Southern knack for telling one heck of a story.

Howard-Johnson is a one of a kind writer and her novels will be remembered long after we are gone. She has a way of turning what would normally be just an ordinary story into a polished gem that we will cherish and take out of our treasure chest to examine again and again.<br />'Harkening' is made up of seventeen stories, each of them excellent and unique. I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite among them. If forced to choose, I would have to go with two of them: Child's Play and Remembering Winter.<br />Child's Play gives us a look at the prejudice in this world against anyone who is different from others in their surroundings - told through the eyes of an innocent child. The hurt and confusion of this innocent child radiates from the pages.<br />Remembering Winter is another look at this same innocent child who just does not fit into the world in which she finds herself. As Howard-Johnson tells it, `There was a child in the central portion of my brain who was new in school. New in town. She had come from a different place, a different background, and a different religion. She did not fit into the frame but there she was.'<br />Be sure to add 'Harkening: A Collection of Stories Remembered' to your list of favorite books - right up there beside Howard-Johnson's first novel, This Is The Place.

MikeAngel the truckers called him on the CB. To Tracie, he indeed looked like the Archangel Michael, come to earth in human form. He was the most handsome guy she had ever laid eyes on. And he treated her like a little sister, which was fine with her, as she trusted no man. But Mike seemed so very different in some way. Somehow she didn't think she wanted Mike to think of her as a sister.<br />Allie McCormack has created a very compelling story in TRUCK STOP. Not only does she give the reader a love story and a happy ending for a young lady who has suffered a lifetime of abuse but she has given us the majestic splendor of Wyoming too. What more can a reader ask for? TRUCK STOP by Allie McCormack has been added to my shelf of favorite books.<br />***<br />Reviewed by Kristie Leigh Maguire, author of Emails from the Edge (The Life of an Expatriate Wife), The Marcie Trilogy (Desert Triangle, Cabin Fever, Ring of Fire); and contributor to Calliope's Mousepad: Women Writers Online...	2002-06-14

On the other hand, I am a big fan of anything to do with the liberation of women, which is why I requested A WOMAN'S LIBERATION for review.<br />`A WOMAN'S LIBERATION: A Choice Of Futures By And About Women' is an anthology featuring some of the finest women science fiction writers out there. Ladies, you have done your jobs as writers extremely well. You have hooked yourselves another fan with this anthology. I was captivated with this book from the very first story. I could scarcely put the book down. I couldn't believe it; I was reading science fiction and enjoying it immensely!<br />A WOMAN'S LIBERATION consists of stories by ten different authors - Nancy Kress, Connie Willis, Sarah Zettel, Pat Murphy, Vonda N. McIntyre, S.N. Dyer, Katherine MacLean, Octavia E. Butler, Anne McCaffrey, and Ursula K. Le Guin. It would be very tough for me to pick a favorite story out of the ten featured in this book; but, if hard pressed, I think it would have to be `Rachel in Love' by Pat Murphy with `Inertia' by Nancy Kress coming in a close second.<br />Fans of the science fiction genre, this is a must read. For all you readers out there who haven't tried the science fiction genre, this a book that you need to read; I think you will become hooked just as I was!...	2002-05-22

Although the events in this novel are fiction, the setting of Lily Dale, New York is very real.  Lily Dale is the largest center in the world for the religion of spiritualism.<br />In The Blink of an Eye is the story of Julia Garrity, a medium who was born and raised in Lily Dale, and Paine Landry and his daughter who came to Lily Dale from California for a funeral, the second one in three years. But this is not only their story; it is the story of all the people who make up the community of Lily Dale.<br />Staub takes the reader on a winding road of mystery, intrigue, romance - and ghostly events that could have actually taken place considering the location of the story - Lily Dale, New York. Staub's style of writing in the present tense took some getting used to but the story line makes for an interesting read...	2002-05-22

The setting for the movie is the majestic estate of Silverbridge. The last thing that Tracie had on her mind when she went to England was falling in love. But from the moment she met Harry Oliver, the Earl of Silverbridge, the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu was too overpowering to ignore. Lord Silverbridge had no intentions in becoming involved with anyone - especially an American movie star. What, then, was this strange and intense attraction he felt towards Tracie?<br />The developing love story between Tracy and Harry in itself is enough to keep one's eyes glued to the book. However, Joan Wolf goes one step further in this novel - she not only throws in a fascinating mystery but also the love story of a long ago English governess, Isabel, and the former Earl of Silverbridge, Charles Oliver, as ghosts from the past. Tracie Collins is the bridge between the past and the present.<br />Joan Wolf ingeniously combines contemporary romance with historical romance in SILVERBRIDGE. The combination of the love story from the present and the love story from the past makes for a very intriguing read...	2002-05-22

Away from the man she was supposed to marry, to spend the rest of her life with. The words that she had over heard right before starting that long walk down the aisle kept echoing in her ears, \\"I just wish I knew if I'm about to watch Bonnie and Clyde getting hitched, or Mary Poppins being tied to Al Capone.\\"<br />Judi saw the horse and rider loom up in front of her as she drove down the lonely Wyoming road. She was going to hit them! She swerved the car off the road and ran smack dab into a tree. As she came to, she slowly opened her eyes. She was staring into the greenest, sexiest eyes she had ever seen. She felt the heat from those eyes clear through her body.<br />Thomas Vance stared down at the girl in the wrecked car. She was slumped over and bloody. She was dead! Then her hazel eyes slowly opened and she looked up at him. Clear through to his soul. He felt himself being pulled into those eyes. But she was an outsider and Thomas knew all about what could happen when you let outsiders into your life.<br />\\"What's your name?\\" Thomas demanded.<br />\\"I don't know-----.\\"<br />Patricia McLinn has created a wonderfully entertaining story in THE RUNAWAY BRIDE. It takes you from the sophisticated world of Lake Forest, Illinois to the rugged life of a ranch in the wilds of Wyoming. There couldn't have been more of a contrast between two people than there was between Judi Monroe and Thomas Vance.

Empty. Broken down on a lonely Montana road as the pitch-black darkness settled around her. There could be all kinds of wild animals out there. But Tess soon discovered that the worst of wild animals didn't come equipped with four legs.<br />Dallas Haynes rode through the night with the light from his motorcycle cutting a swathe through the darkness. Up ahead on the desolate highway, he saw the flashing lights of a vehicle parked by the side of the road just as his headlight picked up the sight of two gigantic elks standing in the middle of the road. He laid down on the brakes, his motorcycle skidding, almost laying over. As he brought his bike under control beside the vehicle, the car door opened and a vision of loveliness stepped from inside.<br />Tess looked up at the biker who had nearly run over the elk. Long dark hair tied back in a ponytail, silver eyes gleaming, a fierce expression on his face as he glared at her. A nightmare come true. Then she saw the headlights and the roars of the other bikes as they came upon them. The nightmare truly began.<br />Is it a thriller or a romance? Lauren Bach does an excellent job in combining both in LONE RIDER. This is a page-turner book if I have ever read one. Lauren Bach is one hot writer - in more ways than one.  Bach has earned herself a place on my most favorite author list and is there to stay. I highly recommend this book not only to romance readers but to fans of the thriller genre as well.<br />***<br />Reviewed by Kristie Leigh Maguire, author of Emails from the Edge (The Life of an Expatriate Wife), Desert Triangle from The Marcie Trilogy, contributor to Calliope's Mousepad: Women Writers Online - and founder of NUW Independent Authors Community&lt;...	2002-05-22

Page had fallen in love with not only the country and its customs but also with one of its citizens - in the form of the handsome and sexy Kenji Tanaka whom she had met in the sento (the communal co-ed bathing house). She had been relaxing in the hot steamy water when she heard a male voice asking could he join her. She looked up to see the naked vision of the most handsome man she had ever seen. How could she deny him access to the sento? After all it was communal and it was co-ed.<br />Deborah Kemp writes a fast paced story filled with not only romance, love and sex but also with intrigue, kidnapping and attempted murder. I was fascinated with Ms. Kemp's knowledge of Japan, its language and its customs. I recommend this book not only for the romance reader but also for the mystery lover and for people who love to read about foreign countries. After having lived in Japan myself, I can verify that it is a very authentic account of Japan and its people.<br />Kristie Leigh Maguire, author of Emails from the Edge: The Life of an Expatriate Wife, The Marcie Trilogy (Desert Triangle, Cabin Fever, Ring of Fire), contributor to Calliope's Mousepad: Women Writers Online ...	2002-04-04
