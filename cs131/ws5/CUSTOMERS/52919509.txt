This book is nothing more than the Pub 17 available for free by downloading from the IRS web site.  It does have some nice notes but the US Gov't should demand that Ernst & Young pay royalties to them...that's us taxpayers.  No wonder the Big Five is now the Big Four and if this is what is out there perhaps soon to be the Big Three.  E&Y has shown us a very poor example of business ethics.	2005-01-18

This book is well done and worth the read. <br /> <br />This book is a waste of time if you are an ordinary person earning less than $150,000 a year.  The examples are around an income of $500,000 per year and the lowest example used $175,000 per year.  That is not most people. <br /> <br />You will learn a lot but this book speaks to those that have tax problems not income problems and most Americans (including me) have income problems.	2005-01-18

This book is not intended to make you a vet but to let you understand enough so you, your vet, and your horse can have intelligent interaction.  To his specific gripe about dewormers I disagree.  Just giving a dewormer without knowing what you are deworming for is wrong.  Even for humans a stool sample is lab tested to know exactly what to treat....you'd do less for your horse?  This book is exceptional in that it talks to you with the minimal of medical jargon and what is used is explained.  I do agree with his review about getting the other book.

The book comes as a package with extras that turn out to be nothing more than a free CPA study guide last updated 9 Aug 03 (almost a year ago and you have to mail in a card that gets answered 6 weeks later by email with a link to down load) which makes it out of date with its competitors for the new computerized exam.  Then there is the Power Web website that you can go to with the password in the book.  Except for the PowerPoint slides and Excel spreadsheets for some homework I found the site useless.  McGraw-Hill would be better selling this book by itself (which when I called them it is no longer available by itself) with out the extras that are not worth the cost or updating its &quot;guide&quot; and including it along with the PowerPoint slides, Excel spreadsheets, and Word check figures on a CD IN the book when you buy it.  This whole thing is nothing more than gouging already cash strapped students.  McGraw-Hill should be ashamed.

Save your money	This book is nothing more than a template or a compilation of numerous other books that deal with marketing, prospecting, and selling.  In fact the title is disingenuous.  The book should be renamed to \\"Building, Marketing and Selling Your Business.\\"  The fact that the word Accounting appears in the title is misleading as this book could and does discuss the things necessary to starting and building any business. <br />The book also includes a glossary of accounting terms which is insulting.  If you are an accountant purchasing this book you should already know them hands down or seek a refund from the institution of higher learning that gave you your education in accounting or ask your state accountancy board to revoke your CPA certificate.<br />This book is full of checklists and numerous discussions of what to do but rarely gets to \\"How\\" as the outside of the back cover states.  While the information is useful it is again generic to any business and not specific to accounting.<br />The author bets to death the value of using Microsoft products (to the exclusion of others) and goes though a litany of the things that Microsoft uses/provides.  I am certified by Microsoft in almost all the things that the author mentions in the beginning of his book and I found the authors marketing plug for Microsoft quite humorous but also very wrong.  The author almost gave the impression that he is \\"in bed\\" with Microsoft and may even be a Microsoft Certified Solution Provider himself but never really states his relationship to Microsoft.  This diatribe should have been in an appendix and not part of the main body of the book.<br />Another grating plug is the constant mention of the Accounting Guild that the author is involved with.  It would have been far more professional to discuss this at length in an appendix rather than constantly marketing it to his readers by repetitive mention of it in the text.  One more grate was his constant mention of the Goldmine software for tracking clients without explaining why he thinks it is the best and what is his involvement with it and more importantly why he mentions no other PIM software when he goes though a many page discussion of the various software packages available.  It makes me very suspicious.<br />Also unless you are a firm with at least two or more accountants, two or more marketing people, two or more sales people and the accompanying support staff you are reading the wrong book. You will also have no life.<br />The author implicating states that unless you are dealing with businesses that are $500,000 to $10,000,000 you are not dealing with a small to medium sized business nor are you one yourself.  What a grave insult to small business in general.<br />I am not attempting to slam the author at a personal level in my review but having read the third edition I am left with the begging question as to what was so wrong with the first two that there is in fact a third edition.  After all I was the one that paid for it and I feel that I was stung and strongly so. <br />This book is basically a written seminar on how to build, market and sell your (any) business accompanied with numerous plugs for the authors products (at least it smells like it).  The author did not follow his own advice....be honest with your clients.<br />I also found his web site for the Accounting Guild inactive and email is not there.<br />If you are looking for a book to help you build your accounting business this is not it unless you have $$$$$$ capital and staff to do so.  The book is definitely not intended for the true small business person.<br />Save your money.	2003-06-13

It did so to a very limited extent.  I compared the table of contents to the features listed by Intuit and only about half were covered and one did not even have a full page covering it.  I don't know if the author just chose not to cover them or if the comparison chart of the various features offered with each version on Intuit's web site are nothing more than pure embellishment. Also this book is very expesive (16 cents per page) for what little it does cover and not even Amazon gets a price break off the price that the author lists it for on her website<br />In fairness I have not found any book that covers Quickbooks Premier Edition, Accountant completely.<br />I have to agree with some of the previous reviews that the book does in fact have a \\"help page\\" look and in some respects is not much better. But I also have to agree that there is useful information in the book.<br />Given what I know now I would not buy the book again.  It does not do what the title of the book says.

However I found many of the discussions did not live up to the title's name.  It was simply a review of basic shotgun handling with a light touch to introductory tactics and addresses the homeowner/civilian and left out the police/military folks.  Also like others he seems to fixate on the Remington 870 to the point of addressing the double feed jam which is highly unlikely (but still possible)in the Mossberg 500 since the shell trays that feed the live round to the bolt operate exactly opposite of each other. Ususally the round on the Mossberg drops to the ground.<br />On page 145 he talks about the StressFire Star and references photo's that you do not see until a few chapters later on page 193/4.<br />On page 158 he addresses two methods of operating the slide pump when wounded but leaves out \\"jacking\\" the firearm up vertically while holding the slide then rapidly moving the slide down and back up using the momentum of the firearm to do the work.<br />There is not much out there on combat/tactical/defensive shotguns.  Overall I enjoyed the book and respect the author and recommend you buy it but be aware that is somewhat dated in what accesories are available.	2001-06-12

It is  nothing more than a rehash of the Visual Basic 6 Interactive Course from  Waite Press, which was bought up by Sams.  In the first 300 pages of the  book I found 203 errors!!!  I am not joking.  The biggest was the annoying  problem of seeing variables named one way in the examples only to be named  differently in the accompanying text.  When I contacted the authors about  it only one responded by email.  I sent examples of what was wrong and  strongly suggested a very serious review and editing of the book.  I never  heard from him again.  Until this is done this book should be relegated to  the trash heap, as it will frustrate beginners to the point of not using  nor learning Visual Basic.

I question whether the authors took the beta exam or the live exam.  This book is so heavy on syntax that it completely misses the mark.  While it is good to know the syntax and how to do things in query analyzer, this is not  what the test is about.  None of the GUI tools are covered.<br />This book  really falls down when it comes to questions given on the live exam from  the perspective of  \\"You're the consultant on site.

I have read this book from cover to cover and performed all the exercises in it.  Found the usual amount of errors: exercises that fail, wrong figures, etc.  It is still better than most. You will learn a great deal  about SQL Server 7. The one error most annoying is the fact the authors  wrote the book with SQL installed on a domain controller, not on a member  server per Microsoft's installation instructions/recommendations.  Once I  figured out what they had done then Chapter 5 and parts of Chapter 8 worked  since my install was on a member server. Remember the SAM on the member  server never receives a copy of the SAM on the PDC so you have to tell the  member server about domain accounts by logging onto the member server  itself and placing them there via user manager. <br />However this book does  not do much for the test.  I have taken both the Beta Exam and the Live  Exam and passed.  The chapter review questions are extremely easy.    Compared to the real exam this book lacks the scenario type questions you  will see that are given to you from the perspective of \\"you're the  consultant on site.  How would you do this...\\".  While this book did cover  traces and replaying them it was a very light run.  It did not cover how to  modify them and then replay them.  Also not covered were issues with NT  that could cause SQL to halt/fail.<br />If you plan on taking the test I  recommend the following strategy:<br />Use this book Use Transcender (I was a  Beta tester and it is excellent)<br />Use Books Online or better yet buy the  actual documentation set.<br />Good Luck<br />Steven C.

Beta Exam beat this to death.<br />Over abundance of fill in  the blank questions in the book.  None of the questions took the format of  the real exam.<br />BCP is so lightly covered as to be laughable.<br />Nothing  about determining space requirements on a Database.<br />Nothing on how to  accomplish tasks that are normally done by wizards without using the  wizard.<br />Nothing about options when you perform these tasks.  Beta Exam  asked a lot about this.<br />I could go on but you get the picture.  Just wish  the authors had taken the Beta Exam so the book would have done a better  job.  If they did take the exam they failed to incorporate lessons  learned.<br />If you buy the book do so knowing it will tell you some good  stuff about SQL Server 7.0 but it will not get you ready for the  exam.<br />Cheers	1999-06-09

While I had hoped that Jennings  would have written an accurate historical book and let the facts lie where  they may I instead found him espousing historical revisionism or the sole  viewpoint of the liberal media (the media's own surveys show that Jennings,  et.al. are 85% white, college educated, liberal, do not attend church, etc;  hardly main stream America).<br />Of particular note was his revisionism of  the 80's.  Whatever one's political viewpoint not one-ounce of credit is  given to the man who won two landslide elections by the American people and  is predominately responsible for ending the Cold War and gave us the  greatest economic expansion is history.<br />I guess Jennings is correct  (along with the rest of the media) that we, the American People, are poor,  uneducated and easy-to-command and we were wrong to have elected Ronald  Reagan to two terms as President of the United States.<br />Regards	1999-05-25

I just received this book today and have spent several hours going thought it.  <br />To the point.  This book is based on a beta version of SQL 7.  I have Beta 3, Release Candidate 1 (RC-1), and the Release To Manufacture  (RTM) of SQL 7.  An example is Figure 9-7, page 292.  The screen capture is  of a Beta version as the left pane DOES NOT match either RC-1 nor the RTM  version.<br />This is but another example of rushing to publish, in order to  be first, a book not yet ready.  I have had RC-1 for six months now. Why  did not the author nor the publisher update the screen captures?  I keep  seeing more and more of this from Osborne.<br />I  took the Beta exam 70-028 and of the 114 questions several were on Roles,  permissions, etc yet this book has but a few pages!!!! covering  this.<br />Leave this book on the shelf.  If neither the author nor publisher  cared enough to use something better than a Beta version to write/publish a  book nor sit for the Beta Exam what do you think your odds are of getting  what you need to pass the exam as the title suggests?????<br />Regards	1999-04-15

I purchased this book based upon the reviews on this web site.  What a mistake!<br />I am at page 115 and have found 34 errors that are not on the errata sheet available on the publishers web site.  I have even found  errors on the errata sheet.  Many errors are the inability of the author to  be consistent in his code examples.  He will define a value as  \\"lblLengthSong1\\" and then immediately in the code example use \\"lblSong1\\" on  the same page within inches of each other.  Sorry these are different and  cause the example to crash when you compile.  I have even found the example  used for the address book in Chapter 3, Lessons 4 and 5 to not only differ  with each other but to differ with the source code provided on the CD- ROM.  I am not talking about the additions put in by the lessons but the  misspellings and misnameing of values and variables. Additionally, some of  these errors in this book where not even corrected from the previous  version of Visual Basic 5 Interactive Course but literally pasted as is  into Visual Basic 6 Interactive Course.  This is sheer laziness.  I won't  be submitting to the publisher all the errors that I have found.  That is  not my job.  Competent editing is their job and I won't do it for free.<br />I  admit that all books have errors and some troubleshooting is always good  experience.  However this book is clearly marked on the outside back cover  as being for beginners to intermediate.  The only thing this book will do  is frustrate the beginner to the point of quitting and forgetting to learn  VB at all or at least to move on to different books.  The author has done  great harm in getting individuals to accept VB as a programming language.   If he is an example of what VB programmers publish who would want one in  their shop?<br />If you are new to Visual Basic PLEASE start with another  book.  When you have some experience and knowledge of VB then perhaps you  can get through this book.<br />I sincerely hope that Waite (now under  MacMillian Publishing) will recall this book and fix it!!<br />Regards	1999-02-05

The first 546 pages are really for SQL Admin while the remaining pages through 925 are for Developers.  Both parts are well worth the read from either perspective.  The Appendices apply to both.<br />Of the eight books currently in print on  SQL Server 7 and on my bookshelf this one ranks at the top.<br />The text  flows in an easy to read manner.  The illustrations are all legible and  placed around the text referencing them.  What a breath of fresh air!  The  CD-ROM actually has useful material on it versus the junk that one usually  receives on an accompanying CD.<br />The book is well organized and presents  SQL Server 7 in a manner that maximizes learning.  I am giving some very  serious thought to using this book as a text for the Masters class that I  teach on Database Servers.<br />Messrs. Otey and Conte have done a superb  write.  While not the panacea or end all you will be hard pressed to find  one single book that accomplishes so very much at an exceptionally  affordable price.<br />Spend the money to buy the book.  It belongs on your  desk at work.  What more can be said?<br />Regards	1999-01-17

I bought this book only to find out for starters that I have been lied to.  The following text is what I have sent to both the publisher and the author:<br />&quot;I have just received this book.  I am not happy.  First the  $225 CBT value is wrong.  It is exactly the same sample available for free  from the Scholars.com web site as a demo of their training.  There is NO  difference.  It fact it is only one of many available from Scholars.com so  it is in NO way a complete course to prepare you for study.  Why was it  advertised as such?<br />Secondly the INTERACTIVE Training Website advertised  in this book appears to be non-existent.  If I am in error then send me the  URL to get to it.  The only Items I saw on your Interactive page where  marketing plugs for the MultiMedia CD-ROM/book sets you have out on C++,  JAVA and VB.<br />To be direct I feel that Prentice Hall and the author are  guilty of blantly misleading advertising and statements.  You put your  names on it&quot;.<br />I realize the axiom &quot;Buyer beware&quot; but at  some point Prentice Hall and the author should care enough about their  reputation to not mislead the consumer. Right now the word  &quot;fabrication&quot; is a good name by which to call both.<br />Leave this  book on the shelf. I doubt it capable of helping you pass the exam since  the Beta Exam isn't even due out until Feb 99. <br />Any enity that knowingly  misleads is not worth your hard earned money.<br />Regards.	1999-01-15

While this book maybe less than what a seasoned DBA maybe looking for it is non the less an excellent book.  The author wrote the book using Beta 3 and I used it against RC-1 of SQL 7.  There were some differences but not  enough to interfere with the authors clear introduction to SQL 7.<br />I believe you will find SQL Server 7 for Dummies to be a  superb introduction to SQL 7 and as only one of two books on the subject in  print at the time of this review it is the least expensive and most  informative.<br />Regards	1998-12-10

The author has the habit (as many of us do) of ssssshhing all her s's.  This is why most studios place the foam over the  mic.  The recordings were obviously done in a non-studio enviornment nor  with the door closed to the room in which she was recording.  You can hear  children in the background playing and in one of the clips the *passing  Train* was so loud that it not only drowns out the audio, it was painful as  well.  Additionally, the author has absolutely no enthusiasm in her  recordings.  There just being read and not well.<br />What could have been an  excellent vehicle to train with (and should be at $100!!) is utterly  destroyed by the audio clips.<br />Until the revised edition (???) comes out  please leave this book/CD-ROM on the shelf and your money in your  pocket.<br />Prentice Hall should recall this product and fix the audio clips.	1998-12-02

While I will not disagree with the comments of other reviews I have given the rating of one star because you can not even begin to use the DB on the CD of you are already not proficient at SQL Server.  Here is what I have  found wrong and what I did to fix it.<br />First Sams does not have any fixes  posted at its web site for this book. Shame on Sams!<br />2nd: pages 6 &amp; 7  of the book use the command line to install the database which is ok but  Sql Server 6.5 is GUI. The instructions/commands given did install the db  structure but would not let the data be put in via bcp commands. Database  was locked because it was loading; loading what??  Also the log file is put  in the data file.  This is a huge no no.  The log file should be seperate  so you can recover the DB.  Once I did that I could move data to the DB  from the Bcp command line.<br />3rd: the pubdata.dmp file is missing so you  cannot install the bigpubs database off the CD.  You must copy the pubs  database to bigpubs to obtain the table structure. This must be done before  using the bcp command line.<br />4th: the names of the tables in pubs do not  align with the names in bigpubs so when using the bcp command line you need  to be aware of this. The cd uses the 8.3 format.<br />5th: the sales file has  168725 rows which is ridiculously large.  It files the log files (at  168000, just 725 rows short) and aborts the install of the sales file.   Finally did the following to get the sales data into the sales table:<br />bcp  bigpubs..sales in sales.bcp -Usa -p -c -b1000<br />This forces commitment at  every 1,000 rows so the darn thing will work. It won't file the log files  either!!!!<br />6th: the note on page 7 refers to pubdata.bmp!! A bitmap??   Think what it should have been .dmp.  Anyway the dmp file is NO Where on  the CD.<br />7th: the book doesn't have a rating on the back cover for novice,  beginner, intermediate, etc.  If you are a beginner you probably did not  understand the fixes I did.You may still obtain a lot out of the book but  pages 6 &amp; 7 will prove difficult.  Hopefully you will have access to  someone who can assist you with the above.<br />Sams usually does a better job  than this.  Since the book has been out since May of 98 it is inexcusable  that there are not any fixes posted to the Sams web site for this  problem.<br />I have emailed Sams and asked them to review this so they can  get the fixes on their web site.<br />Regards and Best Wishes to all.	1998-11-20
US	52919509	R2VZS6NOCEV2X2	0674354117	685981170	Getting Away With Murder: How Politics Is Destroying the Criminal Justice System	Books	1	8	19	N	N	A rhetorical diatribe better suited for a college text!!	This book is filled with numerous questions that are never answered by the  author.  I felt like I was back in graduate school listing to yet another  boring lecture from yet another boring member of academia.<br />The first part  is a diatribe with strong overtones that the current legal mess (and  others) are the fault of white males.  The author throws in just enough  facts and fairness to overshadow this.  The author goes out of her way on  two occassions to mention that she is a victim of rape (&quot;over two  decades ago&quot;) while adding nothing of substance to the overall  discussion.  She additionally uses she thoughout the book instead of a  mixture of he/she.  Perhaps the author is attempting to make up for all  those years she read books using he. This was and is not the time or place  for this.<br />While the points raised are worthy of intellectual discussion  and do need to be addressed by society as a whole the author buried any  hope outside of academia.  This book is a difficult read for the layperson  and should be relegated to the law school book shelf.  If the author was  attempting to reach the masses she has failed completely.  The author never  really addressed the subtitle of her book: &quot;How politics is destroying  the criminal justice system.&quot;  Instead we are left with unanswered  question that we might see on her exams at USC.	1998-09-20

The text reads well and was worth the effort to read  it non-stop in four hours. If you had doubts about the current judical  system this should scare the hell out of you to hear from the bench how  criminals are often the winners in our judical system while law abiding  citizens are the victims.  <br />I wish Judge Rothwax would have given some of  his personal history on how a former legal aid lawyer and card carring  member of the ACLU changed into what most would call a hard nosed  conservative.  This missing part in no way detracts from the book.<br />An  absolute must buy!!!!	1998-09-20

Several of the things mentioned in the book indicate that it was written at least 9 to 12 months ago.  Chapter 7 is so full of errors on IP address assignments that the text is very confusing when trying to follow along with the figures.  Through out the book the text is not aligned with the figures and in one case the figure is outright in error. When looking at the back of the book to see what background the authors have, they should stick to driving tanks and management.  They have definitively proven they can not constuct a nework and shouldn't.  O'Reilly had a good reputation with its Unix books. A damn shame they have destroyed it with this window oriented book.  Perhaps O'Reilly should give up on Windows books since they did not even do a perfuntionary Quality Audit of this one.	1998-03-31
