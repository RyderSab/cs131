From a very young age she has always known she was the Queen-to-be, destined to take her mother's place. Because of the terrible circumstances of her birth, Rain wasn't raised or trained by her mother. In fact the Queen barely even looked at her. She was raised instead by Deborah, the priestess who foretells of another secret destiny in her future. Trained by her warrior cousins Asteria and Astella, she dedicates herself to becoming the best horsewoman and warrior in the tribe. She believes that is the way to gain her mother's acceptance. Her hopes are dashed however when Alina takes on the servant Penthe as her companion. To make matters worse, Penthe's daughter Io wants to be Rain's sister. But a fierce Amazon warrior has no time for sisters.<br /><br />On her first solo journey with her white mare Sky, Rain finds a bear cub. She takes it back to her tribe and names it Usha. Io loves the cub as much as Rain does and together they raise her as their sister. Through this bond, Rain accepts Io as her little sister. When Usha grows up Rain rides her like a horse and imagines one day riding Usha into battle and frightening the warrior men with her power. But Usha is killed in Rain's first battle and she realizes her mistake. She trained Usha to be a horse instead of a bear.<br /><br />Likewise, no matter how hard Rain strives to hate and kill men like all the other fierce warrior women in her tribe she is constantly drawn toward a different path of mercy and peace. Eventually Amazon traditions collide with her vision of the future and she faces the greatest test of her true destiny.<br /><br />\\"The Foretelling\\" is an unusually spellbinding coming-of-age tale. Readers will ride like the wind along with Rain on this fascinating journey into the deeply sensuous tribal life of the Amazon.	2005-09-30

The men, Buford and Al are hungry and desperate. Daisy's a lousy cook and when they get a taste of her runny eggs and uncooked sausage, Coco and Sonja figure they won't stay long. It just so happens that Buford is a great cook so he takes Daisy and the girls shopping and cooks up a meal. Daisy is very young single mom and life in tiny little Whitchit, Oklahoma, lacks the excitement she craves. Instead of turning the convicts in she allows them to stay at her secluded farmhouse. Much to Sonja and Coco's horror, she falls for Buford over their long weekend of captivity.<br /><br />Eventually they let Coco go back home and Daisy makes up a story about why the men are staying with her. For the rest of the summer Coco must deal with her own confusion about the situation. She knows what Daisy is doing is wrong but she has also gotten to know the two men and is no longer scared of them. Mostly she'd like the whole thing to just go away. But it's not about to and she's going to have to deal with it, along with helping Sonja cope with having two convicts living with her.<br /><br />Is it wrong to care about convicted criminals? Are they human beings like the rest of us? Coco struggles with these questions throughout the book. The last thing she ever expected that hot August day was to meet two escaped convicts who would change her life forever. \\"Coco Twain Tells the Truth\\" is a brave and perhaps controversial look at the gray area between right and wrong. Porter's details about life in the late 50s in a sleepy little Oklahoma town add a fascinating richness to this sometimes humorous, sometimes tragic story.	2005-09-29

What with clever carpool conversation to conjure, juicy gossip to track, dirty tricks to plan, and oh so many backs to stab, Alicia has her hands full. Meanwhile Massie gets wind of the ballot box switcheroo, the photo shoot, and the new clique. She plots her revenge. What ensues is no ordinary cat fight because these girls are both ruthless AND rich.

I must confess I cringe a little as I hit the send button whenever I am advising a reader to read a book with \\"dummies\\" in the title. But then, that's the whole point. \\"Writing Children's Books for Dummies\\" has only been out a few months and I'm already recommending it to my readers! Of course it is never my intention to insult anyone, but the truth is, over the years, I've been asked some pretty dumb questions. The great thing is this book has the answers.<br /><br />Much more than a how-to manual, \\"Writing Children's Books for Dummies\\" is comprehensive; covering everything from what motivates you to write for children to genres to the children's book market. Yet readers will find plenty of advice such as, how to craft your story, write nonfiction, find a publisher, and market your book. With the help of the thorough table of contents and index, information on a specific topic is easy to find.<br /><br />As a columnist for children's writers I am particularly impressed with Chapter 2: Children's Book Formats and Genres, and Chapter 3: Understanding the Children's Book Market. The biggest mistake prospective children's writers make is that they simply do not know enough about the age group or market they're writing for. Until now, I lacked a single resource to refer my readers to -- but this is definitely it. Lisa Buccieri is a publishing executive with over 15 years' experience in the business, so readers can take her word for it.<br /><br />But wait -- there's more! Experienced authors will find plenty to sink their teeth into. Authors Buccieri and Economy dish up the real meat of children's writing by including chapters on plot, dialogue, point of view, and the awesome task of editing your own work. Authors will love the chapters on agents, contracts, and Ten Best Ways to Promote Your Story.<br /><br />A reader once wrote to me: \\"I'd like to write for children but I can't think of any story ideas. Where can I find story ideas?\\" Well, guess what -- Chapter 20 offers More than Ten Great Sources for Storylines, which is more like 12 full pages of story ideas. Rich Tennant's \\"The 5th Wave\\" cartoons, plus interviews with authors, editors, and agents generously sprinkled throughout contribute to the excellence of this book and catapults it to the top of my list of recommended reading for children's writers.ote to me: \\"I'd like to write for children but I can't think of any story ideas.

She was born in Kolkata, India. For most of her life that was perfectly okay with her. In fact her nickname, Sunni matched her sunny, cheerful outlook. At the end of her 13th summer, she is on top of the world. She and Michael Morrison are seeing more and more of each other and looking forward to 8th grade. But her carefree American life is shattered when her grandparents arrive from India to spend a year with her family. Her mom takes a leave of absence from her job as a chemistry professor. She starts wearing sarees and cooking Indian food. To make matters worse, she informs Sunni that it's no longer okay to have boys come to visit. On top of all that, her new social studies teacher begins the school year with the topic of cultural diversity, which only makes Sunni even more aware of her differences. Suddenly -- and for all those reasons -- she withdraws from her friends and family. Torn between her desire to be a normal American teen and her love for her Indian family, Sunni struggles to meld the two cultures into her life. In the process she must face up to her own prejudices.<br /><br />Sunni comes across as so genuine that any teen will easily relate to her dilemma. Through her exploration and discovery of her heritage, Perkins offers readers an intimate view of Indian culture. \\"The Not-So-Star-Spangled Life of Sunita Sen\\" is a sensitive and realistic portrayal of the unique pressures facing multi-cultural teens.	2005-07-26

But nothing about 47 is what readers expect. He was raised as Big Mama Flore's \\"babychile\\" and lived in the barn at the Corinthian Plantation in Georgia. At age 14, he is sent to live in the slave quarters. Like all slaves, he is branded with a number. From then on \\"babychile\\" becomes 47. He sinks into the brutality and violence of life as a slave picking cotton in the fields. Until one day a young runaway slave, Tall John shows up on the plantation acting like he's been searching for 47 all his life. He claims to be from the \\"land of Elle on the ocean named Universe.\\" And he believes that 47 is the chosen one to lead an ancient galactic battle taking place on Earth. Ordinarily 47 would laugh at such a fool, but this one has a yellow bag of healing herbs and the ability to transform them both into ethereal beings and astral travel to another time in distant galaxies. Together they embark on a scheme to free the slaves and save the world, but in the process that freedom is won through enormous sacrifice.<br /><br />Loosely based on a mythical spirit, High John the Conqueror whom slaves believed was an African spirit sent to free them, this story transcends the folklore and brings to life an at once heartbreaking and uplifting tale of freedom. 47 is a captivating blend of brutal reality and magical fantasy for all ages.	2005-06-25

On Lord Krishna's birthday, a miracle baby is born into THE prominent Hindu family in Mangalam, a village on the southwest coast of India. The general consensus among family members is that the infant must certainly be the avatar, or reincarnation of Krishna. Except Babli, the logical science student in the family, challenges everyone's leap of faith about her tiny cousin. When she catches a glimpse of his long dark hair and sideburns, she quips that he could just as well be Elvis. Neeli, her older sister and aspiring journalist, writes an article about the miracle baby and includes Babli's \\"Elvis\\" comment. But the school newspaper editor rejects her story. So to show him she gives the article to her cousin Raji's brand new husband who is the computer specialist for the Memphis Tattler. After the wedding he returns to Tennessee, and passes the article to the editor who is always eager to publish anything \\"Elvis\\". The editor changes the article so that it implies that the miracle baby of Mangalam is the reincarnation of Elvis and publishes it. Maggie Duckworth, a filthy rich Elvis fan and certified nut case, reads the article and decides she must go to India, find this child King and return him to his rightful throne at Graceland.<br /><br />When Maggie-the-oil-magnate arrives in Mangalam with Alonzo-the-Tattler-reporter in tow, a collision of culture, politics, religion, and espionage ignites an hilarious group insanity that reverberates all the way up to the Prime Minister in New Delhi, reducing government officials to what they do best -- pulling solutions out of their collective butts.<br /><br /> \\"The Avatar\\" is a movie waiting to be put on film.

For that reason, they don't exactly accept Bex, their new recruit with open arms. It's not her spiked green hair, or body piercings, or even her big attitude that makes them suspicious.

Okay, so Luna's not exactly God, but there is much wisdom to be gained from this encounter. Luna is Liam, Regan's older brother, and, well, sister. Or as Regan says, \\"half brother, half sister,\\" which is hilarious when she says it. Because the thing about Luna the novel is that Peters tells the story of Regan and her transgender (TG) brother, Luna with wry, engaging humor that immediately puts the reader at ease with this unusual situation.<br /><br />Luna/Liam's story is told through the eyes of Regan. Luna is about to come out of her cocoon. Because Regan has lived with and loved her brother all her life, she's grown accustomed to his girlish ways. Through flashbacks she realizes that she's always known that even as a kid, Liam was never comfortable in the role of boy. Her sorrow is that she's losing her brother, Liam. Even though she's the younger sister, Regan's life has revolved around keeping his secret. For that reason she also feels a sense of dread about Luna's emerging strength. Her fear for Luna is that she'll be ridiculed or humiliated. As much as Regan wishes for a life of her own, without Luna, she's never done anything to make that happen, revealing her own dependence on her brother as Luna grows stronger. In this way, their lives are remarkably intertwined and the notion of their inevitable separation is heartbreaking, yet compelling.<br /><br />Regan's humorous outbursts and observations -- especially of their parents -- betray her genuine perplexity with the whole situation, while lending a sense of normalcy to the raw emotions swirling through their lives. Understanding Luna -- and therefore any TG - through Regan's eyes becomes an oddly spiritual journey, challenging readers to think beyond outward appearances and stereotypes, to look deep into the soul of another individual and love the person inside enough to let her go.<br /><br />Copyright (c) 2004 by Peggy Tibbetts	2004-11-29

Jones bounced between foster homes and St. Helen's Home for Girls until she landed in Linden Falls. Her foster mother Susan and her daughter Kelly are nice enough but life as a country girl in \\"Podunk High\\" is a total bore. Luckily Fred, her latest in a string of case workers, gives her a web address for ALTLIVES.com, a mysterious computer game that allows her to peer into the lives of the people in her past, including her real mom. She discovers her mom is married to a wealthy man in nearby Pittsburgh and she becomes obsessed with finding a way to get back into her life.<br /><br />When she finds out Josh Johnson is sure to be elected King of the Fall Dance, Trinity devises a scheme to get him to ask her to the dance. But she knows it'll take more than becoming Fall Queen to get her social climbing mother's attention. Undaunted, Trinity works out another plan. Since Linden High lacks a planning committee or a theme for the dance, she and Kelly take over and convince everyone to make it a charity event to benefit St. Helen's. Trinity uses Kelly's name to trick her mom into donating $2,000 to their school's charity and an invitation to be the star of the show. As plans often do, this one grows larger in its dimension until it blows up in her face. Trinity is forced to decide between the real world and ALTLIVES.<br /><br />Trinity's ability to spy on her real mom through the Internet adds a satisfying element of fantasy to the heart wrenching reality of her life. It seems perfectly fair and reasonable that a foster child should have the right to peer into the life of the parent who abandoned her and make her own judgments. While \\"My Alternate Life\\" is an inside look at the life of a foster teen, McClain skillfully weaves the common issues of self-esteem and self defense for young women into the plot. Teen readers will be drawn to Trinity's rough edges and identify with her independent spirit as she makes the biggest decision of her life.<br /><br />Copyright (c) 2004 by Peggy Tibbetts<br /> <br />Copyright (c) 2004 by Peggy Tibbetts	2004-10-25

When Claire suddenly dumps Jim, the captain of the football team and takes up with the local car mechanic Ray, who wears an earring, the trouble definitely bubbles over.<br /><br />Mrs. Phillips goes ballistic over Claire's newfound rebellion and Lyn is caught in the middle. If it isn't bad enough dealing with her overbearing mother and her sassy, secretive sister, Lyn finds herself with three new friends. Jim, the pining ex-boyfriend wants her to help him get Claire back. Dave is the geeky class valedictorian who tutors her so he can get close enough to Claire to ask her to the Senior Prom. And Ray wins her over with his independent, brotherly nature. The result is a comical triangle of spy vs spy as the boys use Lyn to get to her sister. While everyone dumps on her, she in turn dumps on her friend Toni. She gets so caught up in the turmoil at home that she's oblivious to a more serious problem Toni lives with every day. But Ray points it out to her in the nick of time as Toni's dad becomes increasingly violent putting her and her sister Kathy in danger. The Phillips family is forced to set aside their own problems in order to rescue Toni and Kathy from their abusive father. In the process, Claire confesses a shocking family secret she's been keeping inside.<br /><br />Claire's Curse is an old-fashioned teen romance with a dysfunctional family twist. Readers will delight in guessing, then finally finding out who winds up going to the Prom with whom.<br /><br />Copyright (c) 2004 by Peggy Tibbetts	2004-09-24

And that's just fine with her. She has a secret she won't be able to keep for long. She's the daughter of Richard McGraw -- aka Flesh -- lead singer for the notorious rock band, Crossfire.<br /><br />Desert thinks her name is stupid, but she loves her parents, Matti and Richard. She hates the spotlight and life on the road with the band, touring and recording. All her life she's longed for a normal life -- home and school and real friends who don't like her just because she can get them a backstage pass for her dad's concerts. When the band moves to Miami, she finally gets that home and a regular school to attend. But the friend part is more than she bargained for.<br /><br />Because she grew up as an only child in the shadow of a rock band, with tutors and a swarm of adult friends, she never learned how to think of others, much less make friends. In her new life, Liam and Becca seem like pretty good prospects, but Becca's depressed all the time and way too into Crossfire. And Liam's a hunk but his step-mom's a reporter for a local tabloid that wants a story on the band, so he could be the enemy.<br /><br />In Desert's character, Triana has created a wonderful balance between exasperating and endearing.  Desert is self-absorbed, sarcastic and trusts no one. But she's also funny, a talented writer, and has a very unusual life. When things start to fall apart at home and with her friends, readers really want her to get over herself. Will she be strong enough to avoid meddling in her parents' lives? Will she ever become a compassionate friend?<br /><br />\\"Backstage Pass\\" gives readers a sneak peek inside the personal lives of a rock band without feeling like they're invading anyone's privacy. It has all the zany comedy of the Osbournes minus the mumbling, incoherent Ozzy.	2004-06-04

For Annemarie Zimmer Aldrich both are equally heartbreaking.<br />At age 18, Annemarie oozes with confidence and talent as an equestrian athlete. She and her beloved horse Harry are soaring to the top of the eventing world, and riding a path --  carefully chosen by her overbearing Austrian Pappa -- toward the Olympics. During a final jump at competition, Harry shatters his leg and lands on top of Annemarie, crushing her and their future together. Harry's injuries are too massive to mend and he's put out of his misery on the spot. But Annemarie's misery just begins as she's pieced back together physically, yet remains broken emotionally.<br />She swears off horses and riding, for a life with Roger and their daughter Eva, in Minnesota far from her parents' New Hampshire horse farm. She earns a degree in technical writing and buries herself in a career editing software manuals to avoid the pain of coming to terms with her huge losses.<br />Twenty years after the accident it all comes crashing down. She is laid off at her job. Roger leaves her for a younger woman. Fifteen-year old Eva hates her. And Pappa is dying of ALS. Her life in shambles and harboring a rather self-absorbed sense of obligation to Mutti and Pappa's desperate situation, she drags Eva with her back home to the horse farm.<br />Instead of finding refuge, Annemarie sets off on a collision course with her past, present, and future, which happen to be contained in the body of a horse she names Hurrah -- who's almost identical to her Harry -- and the heart of Dan, the man she abandoned along with her passion in that other life. But she can't have either of them until she comes to terms with the pieces of her own shattered soul. So she smothers herself in failure. She can't deal with Pappa's dying or Mutt's hardened resignation. And she can't stand his nurse, Brian. She can't cope with Eva's growing up. She can't handle the details of her divorce, much less Roger. She can't manage the horse farm for Mutti. She can't understand her relationship with Jean-Claude, the horse trainer. She can't bring herself to ride Hurrah, or figure out the strange mystery surrounding his sudden arrival in her life.<br />A calamity of errors -- pretty much of her own making -- sends her spiraling in a downward tailspin as she pushes everyone away until she's alone and looking like she's lost everyone and everything she ever loved. Because Annemarie is truly her own worst enemy, her journey back to soul's passion is that much more heart wrenching and spell binding.<br />\\"Riding Lessons\\" is the perfect crossover novel for teens. They'll be captured by the mystery of who is Hurrah. They'll root for Eva as she twists herself free of Annemarie's suffocating grasp and discovers her own passion in a horse named Flicka. They'll feel the joy and pain of life and death through the intergenerational conflicts played out so realistically through all the characters. They'll taste the romance between Eva and Luis, the stable boy. And cringe as Annemarie flits from Dan to Jean-Claude until she learns what love really means for her.

This is the gripping tale of the events leading up to that disastrous day.<br />Macy is 18 -- and a serial killer. But he wasn't born to kill. The reader is introduced to an innocent toddler, raised by an abusive mother who left him alone outside in the rain for hours, tied by the ankle to an old swing set. Then she came home drunk. By the end of middle school, he was sent to juvie for stealing. When he got out, he stole a car and was sent back. For Macy, the food, accommodations, and attention at juvie were more than he ever got at home. As a rebellious teen, he bought a gun and killed store clerk, Mohammed Aziz. And got away with it. That's how the killing started. After spending a year in prison for attempted robbery, he steals a car, buys a gun and heads off on a killing spree that winds up in Shiloh.<br />Danny is a disabled 16 year-old who lives with his grandmother. He loves monarch butterflies and Leah, the most beautiful girl in Shiloh. He works at The Store with her younger sister, Sally. Leah's boyfriend, Chad is the star athlete and he hates Danny. The Saturday afternoon Macy drives into town, he sees Leah jogging. He chooses her for his next victim and abducts her. In the search for her, the six teens end up on the hill that Sunday morning. One is a killer, one is a victim, and everyone's life changes forever.<br />Told in a third-person, easy-to-read, almost journalistic style, the narrative flits -- like a monarch -- in and out of the lives of the people who cross paths with Macy, those he victimizes and those who victimize him. \\"Shooting Monarchs\\" is an excellent teaching aid for any class or discussion about justice or social issues. In the end the reader must decide Macy's fate. Does he deserve the death penalty?	2004-03-26

Having just made the Regional Olympic Development Program's soccer team the summer before her senior year, she is on top of the world. Soccer is not only her life, it's the map to her future. But it all comes crashing down when her dad arrives late to pick her up from development camp and tells her the bad news -- he has pancreatic cancer. He has three months to live. He's dying.<br />Up to that point in her seventeen years, their family life has always revolved around Leah and her incredible athletic talent and drive to be the world's best women's soccer player in the world. Her dad has always been her biggest supporter, chauffeuring her to practices, games, and camps. But that summer it all changes. By necessity the family focuses on Dad, helping him cope and finding a way to cope with the cancer that brutally takes over their lives. And to further complicate her life, he wants to die at home. At first Leah feels angry and confused. How could this happen when her goals of a college scholarship and the Olympics are just coming together for her?  She figures no matter what happens, she's going to need a miracle to get through this one.<br />When Leah's student coach Clay, out of genuine concern, gets a little too close, she pushes him away. As her dad's condition deteriorates, Leah gradually pushes everyone and everything away, including soccer. Her discipline and determination to be the best fades. Which is a blessing in a way because, as she soon realizes, dying has a way of taking the life out of, well -- life. She is consumed by helping her mother care for her father as he grows weaker. Yet as she learns about cancer and hospice care, and spends precious hours with her dad reading to him and playing cards, she discovers his faith and courage. Even though she loses her self in the process of her dad's death, she reaches down deep and finds her own soul.<br />While Leah's story is a real kick-in-the-guts and Swanson pulls no punches in the gritty telling, at the same time she offers readers a guide for coping with the suffering and the hope of life after death. This is a beautiful saga of love, loss, and the triumph of the spirit.

But don't mistake this book for a travelogue. Each poem and story is a generous slice of African culture spiced with an emotional punch.<br />While reading the book, I happened to see the movie, \\"Tears of the Sun.\\" As the opening scenes played out, I realized it was also about Africa. Of course I immediately thought about \\"Memories of Sun\\". Because I had read most of, I felt a deeper emotional pull into the film's story. No doubt the director and the publisher never intended for the two to complement one another, but they do.<br />Kurtz's superb editing is the glue that holds this collection together. She divided the book into three sections: Africa; Americans in Africa; and Africans in America. Each section is introduced with a poem carefully selected to set the tone for the stories to come.<br />In Africa, \\"Bagamoya\\" by Nikki Grimes offers the sights and sounds of an ancient African seaport. In the following stories, readers meet Annette who exchanges gifts with a South African Bushman girl; Hedi who learns about art in the Roman ruins of Dougga, Tunisia; Auma Adoch who journeys from the hills of Sudan to Mengo, Uganda, to discover whose child she really is; and Kamau who desperately wants his father to see him run his race on Sports Day in Nairobi.<br />In Americans in Africa, \\"Into the Maghreb\\" by Lindsey Clark takes readers on an enchanting trip to Morocco through a child's eyes. In these stories readers travel to Senegal with Josie and her Ole Ma; to a school in South Africa with the rebellious Lincoln; and to Ruaha, Tanzania, on comical safari with Sarah and her family. \\"Her Mother's Monkey\\" by Amy Bronwen Zemser, about the orphan baby monkey, Angus who comes to live with Francine and her family made me weep.<br />In Africans in America, \\"An African American\\" by Meri Nana-Ama Danquah shows readers how it feels to live with and love two cultures. These storytellers show us Chicago through the eyes of an Ethiopian refugee, and southern California through the eyes of a tough Nigerian child-soldier. In \\"Lying Down with the Lion\\" by Sonia Levitin, Ajang's re-telling of a Sudanese folktale changes his new friend, Terry's life.

Even Stacey has one. Since the start of the school year, she dreads sleep because she's been having nightmares about her roommate, Drea. But that's not her secret. The real reason she performs a ritual with candles and sage before bed is not so much to make the nightmares go away, but to make the bedwetting stop. Yup, that's right. In the midst of these nightmares where she's desperately trying to find Drea, 16-year old Stacey wets the bed. Combine that horribly disgusting secret with the fact that the last time she ignored her nightmares, a little girl wound up dead, and you've got a real sense of urgency within a carefully crafted maze of a plot.<br />You see, Stacey is descended from a long line of witches, or Wiccans -- as in followers of the Wicca religion. She knows card reading, potions, and spells, passed down from her grandmother. And she knows the nightmares and the bedwetting are happening for a reason. Even the cards spell out trouble for Drea, who eventually confesses to getting strange, anonymous emails, phone calls, and messages. So Stacey knows she has to pay attention to her dreams, in spite of the miserable bedwetting. When the same lilies that appear in her nightmares show up in the girls' bathroom, Stacey and Drea know that the stalker's not out there somewhere, but right nearby -- in school. Yet their attempt to find out the stalker's identity with the help of their friends, only leads them in circles. In the middle of it all, another student is murdered. From then on, Stacey's nightmares take on an even greater urgency. And everyone's paying attention. Which is a good thing when it comes to keeping Drea safe, but a bad thing when it comes to the bedwetting.<br />As is the nature of secrets, they are eventually revealed, and it seems like even their closest friends have something to hide when it comes to the unfortunate dead student. Could someone they eat lunch with and gossip with, someone they sit next to in class, actually be capable of murder? Through Stacey's spellbinding race to save Drea's life, she unravels the string of secrets and understands everything -- even the bedwetting.<br />Lovers of the hocus-pocus, Harry Potter style of witchcraft might be disappointed. But lovers of the spiritual side of Wicca will be in heaven. Into this real life mystery, Laurie Stolarz weaves an education about true witchcraft combined with a lesson in dream interpretation. She truly has a gift for lifting witchcraft out of the shadow of the broomstick and into the modern world. \\"Blue is for Nightmares\\" cast a spell on me.sip with, someone they sit next to in class, actually be capable of murder?

But I was wrong-on all counts.<br />Heavy-handed it's not. Ghazy's stream of consciousness prose woven through the narrative (translated from the Italian by Marguerite Shore) is at first distracting, then mesmerizing. As I began to grasp the reality of the characters' lives, I realized their story couldn't be told any other way. Violence, destruction, and grief don't happen in ordered, logical sentences, with proper structure and format. The story follows the intersections of the lives of eight young Palestinians-Ibrahim, Nedal, Riham, Mohammed, Ramy, Gihad, Ahmed, and Ualid. Religion is not the common denominator that draws them together, since one of them is Christian. Instead they share the common experience of having lost family members at the hands of Israeli soldiers. Generations of war have destroyed their families and their heritage. They have every reason to be terrorists, but they are not. They strive-not always successfully-to live lives committed to non-violence and peace. Throughout the novel, the recurring theme of achieving non-violence one person at a time resonates.<br />Manipulative it's not. The seven men and one woman are like orphans in search of a family. This desire for family, to live among human beings who care for each other, is what binds them together. They cope with the unpredictable violence from the Israeli occupation forces by living together and helping each other create some sense of normalcy in their lives. Their bonds of friendship and love for each other give hope and meaning to their lives, under utterly hopeless circumstances. Politics and war represent disruption and devastation in their lives, not the force that drives them.<br />This novel is well written. I could easily dismiss that statement by adding: for a 15-year old. But that's not the case. Each character is so uniquely drawn I couldn't help but wonder if they are based on actual people. Ghazy shows a keen understanding of the lives of young adults, their dreams, fears, and the everyday struggles unique to that stage of life that seems far beyond her years. In contrasting these essences of normal life with the horror of neverending war, she displays real sophistication as a writer.<br />I believe \\"Dreaming of Palestine\\" is an important novel. It's not so much about religion or politics as it is about how war destroys young lives. It should be required reading for all young adults because they are the ones who will ultimately deal with the tragic inheritance of this conflict, and the trauma that will endure well into the future.ach character is so uniquely drawn I couldn't help but wonder if they are based on actual people.
