So, which one is better? Let's see.<br /><br />Both take place in polar enviroments, one in the North the other in the South. Both involve accidental discoveries of \\"something buried in the ice\\" that two or more parties are more than willing to kill for, to either take possession of or destroy. Both sites are adjacent to lairs of mutant, man-eating killer beasts.<br /><br />What follows is an exciting series of chases, gunfights, betrayals, captures and escapes. When it comes to writing combat scenes, the edge has to go to Reilly. Few can write gunfights better,IMHO. What I like about Rollins is that he spreads the action around among several of his characters. This gives the story a little believability, or at least as much as one could manage when reading this type of story. Reilly gives his main character the bulk of the action scenes which even Superman would have a hard time handling. Sure, both books have scenes of their characters making extremely, unlikely and miraculous escapes from certain death situations but with Rollins, at least you're not reading about it happening to the same person over and over again.<br /><br />So who's the winner? You, the reader, are. If you're a fan of this genre, you can't go wrong with either book. My reccomendation is to read them both. Just don't read them back to back.	2005-02-16

James Patterson must have been paid well for his cover blurb praising Ted Bell because he couldn't possibly have read Hawke and made such a ridiculous statement.<br /><br />The concept of the Alex Hawke character is a good one and should have worked but in Bell's hands, he manages to make him the most boring character in the whole story. Others have pointed out the technical errors and the awful dialouge, so I won't go into it here. The subplot involving a hispanic Marine stationed at Gitmo, is the only part of the book that is well written. In fact, the writing is so superior to the rest of the book,it suggests to me that this book was written by committee. I see that Mr. Bell is a big shot ad exec. It must be nice to have friends in high places. I'm sure it helps alot in getting your work published,even if it is sub standard.<br /><br />As far as being hailed as the \\"new Clive Cussler\\", Ted Bell couldn't sharpen CC's pencils.	2004-09-17

Running Blind is a definite step up from TRIPWIRE, which absolutely stunk, but that's still not saying much for this book.<br /><br />Frequent readers of this genre will figure out the motive, the method and the identity of the killer hundreds of pages before Jack Reacher and the entire FBI do. Sure I was momentarily distracted by some of the red herrings Child threw at me, not the ridiculous appearance of an Army chaplain from out of the blue towards the end, that was just lame.<br /><br />KILLING FLOOR and DIE TRYING remain my favorites in this series. The Jack Reacher character is getting annoying by now with his steadfast refusal to own anything that doesn't fit in his pockets. That includes any changes of clothes! Jack just sleeps in the buff and lets his clothes air out to wear day in and day out. I'm about the same size as Jack, six foot five and 260lbs, and believe me, if I didn't change clothes daily there is no way bra-less FBI agents or gorgeous Wall St. lawyers would be throwing themselves at me. Not that they do anyway, but that's another story.<br /><br />I may pick up another Jack Reacher story in the future but only if I can find it in my local library where I found this title.  While these stories are mildly entertaining, they simply aren't worth the money.	2004-09-14

You know when someone is cooking something on the stove and they want you to taste it? You take some off the spoon and it tastes good,but it needs a little something to make it better. Maybe a dash of salt? or pepper?  That's the way I feel about Thomas Perry's books.  He writes interesting characters, I love Jane W.,and his plots are plausible and engaging, but there is just something missing that I can't quite put my finger on.<br /><br />I found the romance with Dr. McKinnon to be rushed and contrived. It's not unusual to develop romantic feelings for a long time friend but it is unusual to propose marriage to her right after making love for the first time. It would have read much more realisticly to let this relationship develop over two or more novels.<br /><br />Dance for the Dead, was my fourth or fifth Perry novel. So far, I haven't been blown away like many other reviewers have. Until Perry finds that dash of something, he'll always be a 3 star writer to me.	2004-09-13

Perhaps because I thoroughly enjoyed NOO, I found this one to be a disappointment.<br />Like the former, MW gives the reader some background about the antagonist, which I enjoyed, however, this time around I feel he leaned way too heavily on the mystical journey stuff.  While I do read fantasy/sci-fi where this is often featured, I didn't see it as necessary for this kind of story.  Maybe it took me by surprise as the previous book had none of this.<br />MW writes men in action very well.  Charley Payne is an interesting character.  The one time CIA shooter tires of a life of violence and becomes a shooter of a different sort, a photographer who occasionally takes crime scene pix for the local police to help pay the rent.<br />Alfie Woodard is an excellent villian.  Abused as a youth because of his Aboriginal heritage, he finds a home in the SAS where he learns the killing arts.  Later he hangs out in the Outback where he studies the dark arts with a witch doctor of sorts.  He combines these skills to become an enforcer for an international drug dealer.<br />The story has several large holes which are difficult to ignore.  While I'm sure drug dealers will sometimes order someone killed in a particularly brutal fashion to send a message to others, I doubt they would approve of their hitman using such a distinctive M.O. time after time.  The killing ritual, which includes cannabilism and wall painting with the victims bodily fluids seems excessively high profile and bound to draw some unwanted attention, which it does.  Charley's current girlfriend just happens to know someone who is an expert in Aboriginal art and folklore.  With little argument, she drops everything and flies halfway around the world with a man she just met to catch a killer with magical psychic powers.<br />The climatic showdown, gets too entangled in the black magic stuff.  Still, for it's flaws, Marcus Wynne knows how to tell a story.  I never once considered not finishing this book.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if it was my first MW book. I look forward to BROTHERS IN ARMS, which I understand teams Charley Payne with the hero of No Other Option.ll, for it's flaws, Marcus Wynne knows how to tell a story.

Though she did seem a little lacking in the personality department, I'm hoping that will change as the series progresses.<br />While in college, Jane helps a fellow Native American, of questionable integrity, escape some bad guys with even less and stumbles on a career.  After performing a string of successful disappearances, Jane is duped into compromising a client's identity.  It takes her quite a long time for her to figure out who the bad guy is, most readers of this genre will figure it out right away, but once she does, she gets right on the trail.  While the methods she employs to do this all make logical sense, they do require gigantic leaps of faith on the part of the reader.  Still, one can't help but to admire her tenacity.  The showdown is exciting and suspenseful.<br />The pacing of the story is a little uneven in places.  This is a flaw I've found in every Perry novel I've read, this is my third. In spite of this, I do find him to be an original and entertaining storyteller and will continue to seek out other titles.	2004-05-31

The plot was stale, the dialouge staged and it just failed to generate any suspense at all.  Maybe it's time for the Sean Dillon series to end, I know there are several more after this.

It takes a lot for me to not finish a book but after forcing myself to read over 200 pages, I just can't go on.  Even the promise of a surprise twist at the end cannot keep me interested.<br />Comparisons to The Godfather are not only unfounded but sacrilegious.  Here is a fair and unbiased opinion.  Double Dealing reads like the first draft of a creative writing student.  No research was done, whatsoever.  The story is supposedly set in 1968, yet the author writes of answering machines, designer jeans, TV shows like All in the Family and M*A*S*H, and movies like The Bad News Bears which are all products of the 70s.  There is no knowledge of police procedure.  The story fails to create even an inkling of suspense.  The characters have all the depth of cardboard cutouts.<br />The editing is terrible.  New paragraphs begin in mid-sentence. The narrative changes haphazardly.  I wanted to like this book and was sure I would when I read the rave reviews but in the end I feel like I got Double Dealt.<br />I know how difficult it is to get something published, that's what the one star is for.	2004-01-17

After reading many positive reviews for his work, I picked up a copy of Death Benefits at my local library.  This tale of insurance fraud and murder was refreshingly original.  I must say, however, that the pace of the story seemed awkward and uneven at times.<br />Walker, the young insurance analyst who is pressed into sevice by the grizzled veteran investigator, seems to take getting attacked in alleys by thugs and shot at right in stride. He follows Stillman, the investigator, around like a puppy,taking everything he says as gospel.  The ending was reminiscent of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, not in the Sci-Fi sense.  You'll understand when you read it.<br />Overall, I wasn't blown away by Mr. Perry but he has sparked my interest and I will check out other titles by him.	2004-01-17

Having read KILLING FLOOR and DIE TRYING, I eagerly picked up a copy of TRIPWIRE.  It is easily the weakest of the three.  The villian, Hook Hobie, is like something out of a Marvel Comic book.  Every time a character meets him, Child describes him all over again in the same terms, from the half burned face, to the J shaped hook where his hand should be.<br />Reacher's relationship with Jodie seems rather strange. Especially when Reacher admits to being attracted to her when she was a child, it sounds downright creepy.  I was,however, glad to see him ready to give up his paranoid, wandering lifestyle.<br />The plot was barely interesting and any avid reader of mystery thrillers will figure it out long before Child tells us.  I was glad that I picked this book up from the library. I would have felt cheated if I actually paid for it.  I hope this isn't the beginning of the end for Mr. Child.	2003-12-06

Most of them are pretty standard fare and follow a basic formula.  The end is almost never in doubt.  But it's not about the destination, it's about the journey and Marcus Wynne takes the reader on a very suspenseful and exciting one with No Other Option.<br />Some may say that the characters lack significant depth and they would be right.  But let's face it, this isn't Pulitzer winning material.  If that's what your looking for look elsewhere.  For me, the characters are as fleshed out as they need to be.<br />I rank Mr. Wynne right up there with my favorites in this genre, most notably Stephen Hunter.

Nelson DeMille has written some of the best novels I have ever read:  Word of Honor, Charm School, Gold Coast. Up Country, I'm sorry to say, doesn't stand up there with my favorites.  The only connection this book has to The General's Daughter is it's hero, Paul Brenner.  Paul is coaxed out of retirement to investigate the murder of an Army officer by another during the Tet Offensive of 1968.  No one, including the reader, believes that this is a simple murder investigation and we have to wait almost 600 pages to have that fact confirmed in what is by then a weak climax.<br />The most interesting moments come when Paul revisits the sites of his former battles when he served with the First Cavalry during the Viet Nam War.  I think that veterans will especially find much of interest in these segments.  I know for me, they gave me a renewed appreciation of what combat conditions were like for the young men who were sent into the maelstrom.  It was facinating to see through Paul's eyes, the irony of these places where he had fought for his very life turned into tourist attractions.<br />The book is least interesting when it delves into the romantic connection between Paul and the beautiful (of course) woman who is assigned to be his guide and interpreter.  Too much time is spent developing this romance that we all know is going to happen the minute she makes her first appearance.  Paul is only mildly conflicted about blowing off his girlfriend from The General's Daughter.  The very same plotline was followed in DeMille's other sequel, The Lion's Game. Doesn't anyone live happily ever after in DeMille's world?  I'm no hopeless romantic myself but it stretches credibility a little to see the hero who is crazy in love with one woman simply toss her aside in the sequel to repeat the process again with another.<br />If you have never read a DeMille book before fear not.  It is not necessary to read The General's Daughter or any of DeMille's previous books before starting Up Country.  In fact, I think it will work in your favor as you will not have a frame of reference to compare it to.  After reading Up Country however, I strongly urge you to read the above mentioned titles.Country.

Being a fan of the film THE MATRIX and the short-lived TV series HARSH REALM I thought I might find it interesting.  I saw a very entertaining episode of THE X-FILES that was penned by William Gibson, so I figured this would be as good a place to start as any.<br />The core of the story is good and some of the central characters are very interesting but what interesting plot points there are become lost amid pages of pretentious, overly technical, poorly written, Zen-like techobabble.  Gibson does a poor job of creating setting or suspense.  It took me several pages to realize that the principal characters were on a space station in Earth's orbit.  I flipped back to see if I missed something only to find that I hadn't.  The overall mission was unclear making it difficult for me to care if they succeeded or not.<br />I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed but I know good writing when I see it.

While SANDS is reminiscient of EAGLE it doesn't hold a candle to the Higgins classic.<br />It took me four weeks to finish this book.  Four weeks!!!  That's how un-suspenseful and un-compelling I found this story.  I read SHOGUN in less time.<br />Meade's 3 main characters are paper thin, unsympathetic and just downright DULL.

DIE TRYING is Lee Child's second novel featuring his tough as nails hero, Jack Reacher.  Once again Jack is caught up in events that don't concern him.  While walking down the street minding his own business, Jack gets scooped up in the kidnapping of a young woman who is more than she seems.  I liked that Child switched the narrative from 1st person, in Killing Floor, to 3rd person.  It gives the reader a chance to see the problem through several perspectives.<br />What can I say about Jack?  He's cool as hell.  He certainly has a heart and a conscience but it doesn't stop him from being ruthlessly brutal when the situation calls for it.  If Jack Reacher tells you he's going to kill you, start digging your grave.  I especially enjoyed the way he dispatched a would be rapist.  While about to kill him with a swift and lethal blow, Jack decides that would be too good for him and suffocates him instead.<br />Child can be overly descriptive when it comes to weaponary and shooting.  I don't need a page and a half explaining the chemical reaction that occurs when a bullet is fired.  That kind of writing is best left to Stephen Hunter, who is a master at it.  Another small criticism is in the ending.  Jack is left standing on the side of the road with his clothes in tatters and presumably without a dime in his pocket.  It made me think of the ending of THE ROAD WARRIOR.  After all that occurs in the story would the FBI simply wave goodbye?  I don't think so.<br />Still, none of these prevented me from reading a thoroughly enjoyable thriller with an extremely intriguing hero.  I look forward to reading more of Jack Reacher's adventures.	2003-04-09

I followed that up with THE MALLOREON and THE ELENIUM neither series matched the magic I found in the original but they were good reads just the same.<br />I know one shouldn't judge a book by its cover but when I saw THE REDEMPTION OF ALTHALUS it looked and sounded like a somewhat darker tale and I was intrigued.  Much to my disappointment it was even lighter than any one of its predecessors.  Althalus is such a lightweight thief, totally devoid of a dark side, so why does he need to be redeemed?<br />It takes a lot for me to put down a book without finishing it but I dropped this one before page 200.

It definitly beats reading out-of-date TIME or NEWSWEEK magazines.	2003-01-11

The tale of a group of Force Recon Marines avenging the savage murders of their comrades should produce many thrills and surprises. Sadly, in the hands of Thomas Muldoon, this book generates none.  The dialouge is staged and wooden, not at all real sounding. ... I never forgot the fact that I was reading a book and a poorly written one at that. ...<br />Muldoon's hero, Joe Craig, is brillant to a fault.  He is prepared for every single cotingency that arises. This succeeds in sucking all the suspense out of the story. I never feared for the heroes safety. True some of them are killed but I never became emotionally invested in them. I didn't care.  Too much telling and not enough showing.<br />The two stars are for a very good plot.	2003-01-11

I loved almost every book that came before this.  Sum of all Fears is a very compelling story but this book could afford to lose about 300 pages.  Does the reader really need to follow the path of a tree being shipped to Japan?  Yes it does play a significant role later in the story but do I need to know the name of the guy who cut it down and how he came to be a lumberjack?  We're given 3 pages of background on a cop who is murdered and never mentioned again.  And the building of the bomb! I skipped many pages when it came to this.  It's by sheer luck that I happened to stumble on the only significant part of the bomb's making.<br />  This book almost put me off Clancy for good.  I haven't and probably won't read DEBT OF HONOR or EXECUTIVE ORDER.  I did read and enjoy the John Clark stories WITHOUT REMORSE and RAINBOW SIX.  Retire Jack Ryan and stick with Clark and Ding Chavez.	2003-01-08
US	38135446	R1R8RK8MM1WIW3	044022179X	710984646	Dirty White Boys	Books	5	113	120	N	N	Great action story that avoids all the tired cliches.	This was the first Stephen Hunter novel I read and it immediately made me go out and get as many of his other books as I could find.  This is a riveting story that thrills and entertains without falling into the usual cliches so many other authors resort to.<br />There is a razor sharp line that divides the good guys from the bad guys.  At times you don't know who to root for.  If you are new to Stephen Hunter, I envy you.  Although his books are good enough to read more than once, there is nothing quite like reading a great book for the first time.<br />Let me give you a bit of advice:  some of Hunter's earlier works were very disappointing.  I guess he was still trying to find his voice.  Avoid TAPESTRY OF SPIES.  THE SECOND SALADIN and THE MASTER SNIPER are good but don't compare to his later work.  The DAY BEFORE MIDNIGHT was very good and I highly reccomend it.  I suggest reading the following in this order:  DIRTY WHITE BOYS, POINT OF IMPACT, BLACK LIGHT, A TIME TO HUNT.  Enjoy!!	2002-11-16
US	38135446	RPMOXET6U1XHY	0671737767	633434475	Stinger: Stinger	Books	5	3	3	N	N	What a blast!!!	STINGER is just a flat out fun book to read. To sum up the plot by calling it a good alien vs bad alien story doesn't begin to cover it.  Sure it's been done before but never better.  Thrilling chases and escapes make this \\"un-put-downable\\" as so many other books claim to be and so seldom are.<br /><br /> ... I wish someone will buy the rights to this book and turn it into the thrilling blockbuster movie that it calls out to be. On second thought, after reading this book for the third time, I now find myself hoping that no one tries to bring this story to the screen.  I just don't think any film maker would be able to do visual justice to RRM's thrilling sci-fi masterpiece.	2002-11-06
US	38135446	R3H2WANY4UA4AW	0380731851	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A thrilling murder mystery with a brain.	Already being a fan of Lehane's Kenzie/Gennaro series I was a little leery about this book.  After about three pages I forgot about Patrick and Angie and became completely engrossed in this story and it's characters.  Lehane is an artist at creating mood and atmosphere. Every character is fully rendered.  You almost feel like you know them or people like them.<br />My only complaint about Lehane is that he doesn't write fast enough.  I have PRAYERS FOR RAIN sitting on a shelf untouched. I'm afraid to read it because it's the only book of his left that I haven't read.  If you're a mystery fan do yourself a favor and discover Dennis Lehane.  You won't be disappointed.	2002-11-06

As mentioned in other reviews some of the coincidences that make up the core of the story are a little hard to swallow.  But it does little to hurt what is otherwise a very intriguing story.  Jack Reacher is a pleasant departure from the usual action hero. He does what he must to get the job done without wrestling his conscience.  When he dispatches a bad guy,and they're very bad, there is no clever little quip, no dramatic showdown. He has no qualms about shooting first without warning or throwing the first punch.  Jack is a very interesting character and I look forward to reading more of his adventures.<br />  There are a few minor details that I hope get cleaned up in future stories.  jack just wanders the country with only the clothes on his back, no shaving kit, no change of socks and underwear, no deodorant.  The notion of the wandering loner is romantic but in reading about Jack I began to think that he must reek!  Obviously he doesn't as Officer Roscoe will attest but for the sake of nit picky jerks like me... give the guy a knapsack or something!  It won't slow him down any.	2002-10-20

US	38135446	R2AEQCFNNCY4WR	0060513608	394086660	THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO TOWN:   9/11 in Gander, Newfoundland	Books	5	55	57	N	Y	Gives you something to feel good about	Living just 5 miles from Ground Zero I haven't felt the urge to read any of the many books chronicling the events of that horrible day.  On a strong recomendation from a friend I picked up THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO TOWN.  Yes this story will bring tears to your eyes but they will quickly be replaced by sheer awe at a community that, without a moment's hesitation, opened its heart and its doors to complete strangers.<br />If this story was written as ficton one would accuse the author of an overactive imagination.  The people of Gander and it's neighboring communities jumped at the chance to render hospitality and comfort to the &quot;plane people&quot;, as they referred to them.  This story takes the reader through the full range of human emotions from tears to laughter.  Yes, laughter.  I want to go to GAnder myself and just hug everyone I see.<br />If you read one September 11th book, make it this one.  It provides a lesson we all could learn about being a good neighbor.	2002-10-06
US	38135446	RUSO0VVHPNJLF	0671743058	14778474	Boy's Life	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Started out a skeptic, ended up a devoted fan	When I first heard that one of my favorite horror/sci-fi authors was going mainstream I was hugely dissappointed. Why depart from the medium that made you a success? I picked up BOYS LIFE prepared to be let down. From the very start I was hooked. This book is a classic. It reads somewhat like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Though the place I grew up in is nothing like Zephyr many aspects of this story are universal to boys and probably girls also. It's filled with many wonderful and colorful characters. I love the way Cory sets the reader up in the beginning to believe whatever parts of the story are true or have been embellished. It captures the joys and dramas and magic that make up a 12 year olds world. READ THIS BOOK!	2002-06-14
US	38135446	R2TK0EQISMKTD3	0446604801	440825646	Jack & Jill (Alex Cross)	Books	2	1	4	N	N	Here we go again	I really enjoyed ALONG CAME A SPIDER. It was original and suspensful and had a great twist at the end. Patterson used this same formula in KISS THE GIRLS to somewhat lesser effect but it was a good book none the less. Now Patterson returns to the well yet again in JACK AND JILL. Enough already. If he can't find new ways to present Alex Cross's cases then he should retire the character. As I read this book I knew perfectly well that the male/female team of killers was not who the author was trying to focus our attention on. Once again the same plot device is used and it just gets weaker and weaker each time. I don't plan on reading any more Alex Cross novels... I've read them already.	2002-06-14
US	38135446	R1U7XKKT8NB0H6	0812579259	606443502	The Keep	Books	3	4	5	N	N	What's the big deal?	After reading rave reviews of THE KEEP I felt compelled to check it out. Then, inside the book, I found there was a website. After checking out the message board filled with adoring fans, I started the book with high expectations. Perhaps that was the problem.  The premise is certainly very original and the new spins on vampire folklore were very creative.  I failed to find the story to be at all scary as I did in books like SALEM'S LOT.  The mysterious \\"hero\\" who spends nearly half of the book racing to get to the keep because time is of the essence,does no more than sit in the bushes and stare at it for several days... I'll give the author one more chance with the next book in this series THE TOMB but I'll be sure to buy it...at a discount.	2002-03-11
US	38135446	R6C7JGCTVKR0G	0312971230	724985102	Ice Station (Scarecrow Series)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	I love escapism but  gimme a break	Matt Reilly has written a very good action story but with a little restraint he could have written a great one. The action jumps off the page.  The initial gunfight is among the best I have ever read and I read a ton, believe me.  Many books are described as &quot;un-put-downable&quot; but so few of them really are.  This one certainly is up to a point. I don't go searching for realism in my entertainment,be it book or movie form,but ICE STATION just gets to a point where you stop and say &quot;What are you kidding me?!?! Reilly's hero is only missing the red cape to be Superman.  The guy is so resilient it's laughable. Still, for all the criticism I'm throwing at it I must admit, ICE STATION was an incredibly fun read.  It won't be the last Matt Reilly novel I'll read. Take this book to the beach with you.	2002-02-26
