US	43079307	RJVFJ0CI2OLQQ	0743434021	313130863	Beautiful Bodies: A Novel	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Ahh, the dynamics of female friendships. . . .	This book took me a while to get into, but once I did, it was worth it.  Beautiful Bodies chronicles the events of one night where 6 late-thirties women, friends since their first days in NY, meet up for a baby shower.  Cunningham chooses to first introduce us to each of the women by writing about their separate journeys to the baby shower, and then observes what happens when the women meet up, one by one.  But the book really doesn't get started until all of them are together.<br />I've read several books about female friendships, and, honestly, this book is one of the most accurate in describing how the relationships among female friends, particularly when there is more than two, can alternate between gentle, strenuous, compassionate, then explosive (not necessarily in that order) all in one evening.  I totally saw myself and my friends in these characters, and loved how Cunningham expertly described the mood shifts as the evening progressed.<br />I'd recommend this to any woman, as long as they are not expecting a standard plot where everything is tied up in a neat bow at the end.  Unlike most of my favorite reads these days, this book isn't perfect as a beach read -- I think it would be best enjoyed on a weekend night by yourself with a great dinner and a glass of wine.	2003-10-14

I'd probably describe it as a family history, a historical analysis, an essay on cultural diplomacy, and at times an epic poem all rolled into one.<br />I won't go into the plot, because plenty of other reviewers will as well, except to say that the first half pretty much goes day by day, while the last rushes through 30 years.  This particular style was appreciated in that it made the book shorter (and the book is a little long) but on the other hand, the latter half left me feeling a little deprived.  I liked the daily adjustments that the young daughters were making to their lives in Africa - Kingsolver's rushing the reader through the later years meant that you didn't get to experience their thoughts and observations in the same intimate manner, and it is during the latter half, when the family goes their separate ways, that the comparisons between them get really interesting, as one returns to western life, and the other two make very different choices in their new adopted home.<br />Much has been said in the other reader's reviews about the emphasis on the differences between the Prices and their African neighbors in the Congo.  But this is also a book about family.  I would imagine that some readers will see a little of their own relationship with their sisters in the relationships between Leah, Adah, Rachel, and Ruth May.  The ways that they communicate to each other, their resentments, jealousies and the common bond between them (basically, their nutty father) set against the Congo background is what, for me, made this a really entertaining novel.<br />A must read if you're a fan of Kingsolver.  If you're new to Kingsolver, you may want to take on a less ambitious work of hers, like The Bean Trees, so that you won't be too surprised at her takes on Western culture and values as compared to those of more land-based, native cultures.  Enjoy!	2002-08-01

I've had this book on my shelf for over a year, hesitant to read it because I've seen the movie (the Gwyneth version) about 100 times.  I was worried that there would be no suspense in the book for me, having memorized the movie characters so well.<br />I needn't have worried.  Books are never the same as movies.  I found even more to love about Emma as I read this book, and grew to like other characters (such as Jane Fairfax) more, and other characters, such as Frank Churchill less.  While this book did not hold the suspense for me that Pride and Prejudice does (still!), it was nonetheless a great read and I can't wait to reread it next summer.	2002-07-11

This book is wonderful.  At first, it ran a little slow, but as the book goes on, and you explore Thomas and Linda's love affair through time, it picks up, to a positively breathtaking finish.  I have not read Shreve's other books, but I will likely pick them up, for this book was well worth the time spent.	2002-06-25

Unfortunately, much of this information I have already received through my subscription to Shape magazine, which has been very helpful in giving tips on how to be healthy without feeling deprived.  However, the author's gripes about the USDA Food Pyramid are worth checking out.  Additionally, there is valuable information about vitamins and minerals which I did not know - such as which ones I likely already get enough in my diet, and which ones it may be smart to take as a supplement.  If you've found that diets don't work and are looking for substantive information about how to eat in order to be healthy (not just to lose weight), I would begin with reading this book.	2002-06-25

Therefore, I was surprised by the serious tone of How  To Be Good.  Yet, after I got over the initial shock, I found that I was enjoying this novel.  It's not as funny as High Fidelity or About A Boy (I can't imagine a movie based on this novel), but as a study in marriage, and in what it truly means to be charitable, it's highly entertaining.  Actually, I can see this book as Rob and Laura (the main characters of High Fidelity), 10 years into their marriage, if Rob were to spontaneously decide to stop being cynical take up spirituality.<br />My one gripe with the book is that Hornby's casual, slightly detached tone is better suited towards a male rather than a female.  I didn't quite believe that the person telling this story was a woman.  But that's my only issue; otherwise, the book was rather good.	2002-06-25

After reading Jemina J and many other single-girl novel, I was a bit weary of this one.  I mean, I love the genre, but they are not exactly original.  This book is not particularly original either, but it stands out because unlike the heroine in Jemina J, she is utterly believable.  This is what girls sound like - Cannie Shapiro is alternately bitter, funny, compassionate, and always likeable.<br />In many ways, this book reminded me of Billie Letts' Where The Heart Is, because like that book, the heroine can never seem to get too comfortable being happy before another one of life's tragedies hits.  And like the heroine of Where The Heart Is, Cannie makes use of a great collection of friends which will make you laugh out loud.	2002-06-25
US	43079307	RRAJ6B9DA25MU	0060977027	725189863	The New Girls	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Enjoyable book	Entertaining read if flawed.  It's chief problem is that it throws it's net too wide - by attempting to cover the formative years of 5 girls in only 347 pages, I finished the novel feeling as though I really didn't know any of them too well.  One example:  One of the girls, Lisa, suffers from anorexia during her first year at the school.  The author goes into adequate detail explaining how Lisa suffered from the disease, but little else.  By the Lisa's second year, she has recovered and is no longer anorexic.  But the author never tells us how Lisa is able to recover.<br />Some storylines are quite lovely; I am particularly fond of one involving one of the girls, Jenny, who has a brief affair with her teacher.  In describing Jenny's feelings, and the teacher's subsequent restraint, the passages are wistful, painful, and wildly romantic.  I also enjoyed the descriptions of beach vacations, social dances, and stealing into the woods for cigarettes that are woven through the book.  On those occasions, it's a lovely portrayal into the upper-class life of boarding school girls during the sixties.  However, if you're looking for a book describing the interplay of the lives of these girls with the outside world at the time (such as the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War) you won't get much of it here.	2002-06-09

I am not disappointed with Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married.  In fact, I like it more.  Keyes' at time monotonous first-person style in Watermelon is under control in Lucy Sullivan, and the characters are more fleshed out.  For example, I did not quite believe that Claire's husband in Watermelon could really exist in real life but the object of Lucy's desire, the incredibly self-centered Gus, was entirely believable (I think I may have dated him myself).  I found Lucy's depression and low self-esteem utterly realistic.  At times I was exasperated with her-I wanted to shake her out of the poor choices she was making.  However, it's been my experience that it's the characters I want to yell at most that I find the most endearing by the end.  Definitely pick up this book this summer.	2002-06-09

I was promised by Amazon reviewers that this book would make me laugh out loud, and that I would not be able to put it down.  And indeed I laughed out loud and was not able to put it down - I read it in 2 days.  Some of the plot lines I found a tad unbelievable (such as Jemina's losing the weight as fast as she did, and especially Brad, the internet guy's secret. . .never mind, you have to read the book or I'll give it away) but overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a light, frothy summer read.	2002-06-09

Claire is a wonderful heroine -- she's been left on the day that she gives birth by her husband and so she goes to her native Dublin to hang out with her (so-hilarious-you-wish-they-were-yours) family.  Her gorgeous, self-involved sister Helen, her other hippie flaky sister Anna, her sweet mother who can't cook, and her concerned yet slightly aloof father, all round out this novel to make a great story.  This is the perfect light beach read, and at 417 pages, the book will last longer than a lot of other light beach reads.	2002-05-17

You spend the bulk of the book waiting for her to dump her ne'er do well boyfriend and also trying to guess what exactly it is her mysterious, painfully shy roommate DOES in her room.  But the book has many laughs, including a hilarious dinner party she throws for her snotty friend/enemy Amanda.  Good for a quick, light read.	2002-03-21

It doesn't.  Much of the book is about Gary and Rosa's meeting, and their relationships with their parents.  In many ways, I thought this book was more about Rosa and her mother than I thought it was about Rosa and Gary.  And that was a bit of a disappointment for me, since I was expecting something else.<br />Nonetheless, I did have much sympathy for Rosa and Gary, and really wanted them to work out their differences.  But then Gary gets ill, and they simply run out of time.  This makes the book very sad, but in the end, quite poignant.<br />I'll continue reading Rita Ciresi's work, particularly since I highly enjoyed Pink Slip.  This too is recommended.	2002-03-19

I mean, what else was Kinsella going to offer us other than more shopping hijinks?  Been there, done that.  But my mind changed about a third into the book.  This time, Rebecca gets into some dire consequences -- and is all the better for it.  Additionally, her love interest, Luke, is a little more fleshed out than he was in the original.  We find out that he's work obsessed, and has a VERY distant mother with whom he shares a complicated relationship.<br />Throughout her ups and downs, and her discovery of Sephora, Rebecca remains charming as ever.  She's sweet and funny, and Kinsella has a great knack for putting Rebecca in some very akward/humiliating situations that would rival many of Bridget Jone's escapades.  Definately a must read if you've read the first, and if you haven't, go ahead and buy this one along with the first -- you'll want to read it.<br />I just can't wait for more \\"Shopaholic\\" adventures.	2002-02-18

Anyone who's seen LA Story and Bowfinger knows this man is really talented at capturing his characters, and the character of L.A.  In fact, those stories, and this novel, essentially capture life in LA in all it's shallow brilliance, the way Sex and the City does the same thing for New York.  If you like stuff like that, you'll enjoy this read.<br />This short book (just 130 easy-reading pages) is specifically about a relationship between a older man and a younger woman, but in capturing this specific relationship, Martin manages to right a little about all relationships.  Martin narrates the story with a kind of sweet detachment, yet dead seriousness that just kinda warms your heart.  It's definitely a pleasant read, and a nice chance to see what else this man is capable of besides always being funny.<br />Recommended.	2002-02-10

I have only had it for a week, and I can tell that it will be an invaluable resource.  I don't see myself agreeing with her always (I like shiny make-up -- and even blue eyeshadow) but if I hadn't read her review of my sunscreen, I would have no way of knowing that it did not contain any of the top 3 ingredients used to block UVA rays.<br />The people who probably don't like her book the most are likely those who love the products she trashes -- or those who really believe Chanel is worth the price it costs.  Me, I see this book as not being the final word on any given product or item, but as a really helpful resource to find out about skin care and make-up before spend the money. I definately recommend it to those make-up junkies everywhere, as it is easy to read, and reviews every single product found in boutiques, department stores, and drugstores alike.	2002-01-22

I'd recommend to anyone before reading this to watch the movie &quot;House of Mirth&quot; (if you've read the book, that'll do).  This will prepare you for what you are about to read.<br />The story is about Florence Collins, a 32 year-old beauty in New York wants the life of the rich Manhattan elite.  She can only do this really by marrying.  Over the course of trying to make her way into this social circle, she has essentially lost all morals and self-respect, not to mention self-esteem. The beginning of the novel finds her at a friend's house in the Hamptons, where her friend's married husband comes on to her.  The fallout of that event leaves Florence in disgrace, yet she seems to be barely fazed by it, just keeps walking on, staying with the marry-rich plan, despite loosing her job and the massive debt she accrues.<br />This is the kind of novel where you essentially hope that the protaganist will be redeemed by something or someone.  I won't say whether that happens, only that after reading it, wherever you are or whatever you're doing, you'll probably feel pretty grateful for the life you have.  I haven't read any other of Janowitz's novels, but after reading this one, I probably will.	2001-12-28

After having read Ralph's Party, I know I'm right.<br />The story of 6 not quite strangers who live and love in an apartment building should have been cheeky and rather like a bad sitcom.  Instead, the story was quite convincing.  Ralph and Smith are roommates/best friends, caught in an early thirties slump, so Smith finds a roommate, Jem, simply to break the monotany of their lives.  Jem, motivated by a dream, is sure that Smith is THE ONE, but Ralph has figured otherwise.  Smith, the most repulsive character of the bunch, has a dream-crush on the perfect, but mean as a snake Cheri.  Karl and Siobhan, who live upstairs, have settled into a domestic life where neither of them are really going anywhere or improving their lives either.<br />Of course, someone has to get together with someone else.  And of course someone is going to end up in the book with their heart broken.  But guessing which one will be which is half the fun.  My gripes about the book:  Cheri is a bit one-dimensional, and I would have liked to have been in Smith's head a little more.  But all in all, good stuff.	2001-12-28

While the book is an easy read, it was heavier than I expected. The book is about Helen Bradshaw, whose father just died. Instead of dealing with her loss right away, she represses those feelings. The rest of the book is kind of a consequence for that. The lives of her friends and family are collapsing around her, and this actually pulls her at times out of her own self-absorbancy, and so does Tom, the gorgeous vet she met (she then promptly, again and again, makes a fool out of herself in front of him). Helen's casual self-deprecating remarks about herself and wry remarks about her flat mates and friends made me smile many, many times. I thouroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. I can't wait to read Running In Heels.	2001-08-25

All of Austen's trademarks are there: her witty commmentary of the British elite, silly men and women who both exasperate and amuse you, and a good love story. Persuasion is about Anne Elliot, who after breaking off an earlier engagement with Captain Wentworth, is suddenly in his company 8 years later, and longing to rekindle the romance. This book wasn't as fun as Pride and Prejudice, mainly because the struggle between Anne and Wentworth doesn't resonate the same way as that between Elizabeth and Darcy. Neither characters are particularly arrogant (though Wentworth is hostile at being rejected before), but it's still interesting to see how the two will find one another among the silliness of the people and situations around them. Jane Austen just has a way of keeping her reader in suspense, no matter if you feel sure you know the ending. The question is always How will they get together rather than if, and the How here will please any romantic reader satisfactorily.	2001-08-24

It took me back to gold chains and earrings, and girls named &quot;Mercedes&quot;. This book will remind you of basement parties and hanging out at the mall, and watching guys play basketball at your neighborhood park. The most impressive thing about this book was that it was written by a man. Omar Tyree shows surprising insight on what it's like to grow up as a girl, when there were images of sex and materialism all around you, while you're just trying to make it among your peers but still cling to being yourself. As Tracy (the main character) grows up, I was right there with her. She reminded me of the girls I used to hate when I was in school (she's the epitome of the light-skinned black beauty), yet I was rooting for her throughtout the story. Definately read this book, particularly if you like April Sinclair and Terri McMillan.	2001-08-24

This is the second in the Dream series (and I recommend all of the titles -- it's my favorite series to date) and it's  my favorite of the Dream series.  Whenever Nora Roberts makes a series, the formula is typically one sibling who is very cautious, who has been hurt before, one sibling who is on the wild side with a voracious sexual appetite, and one is sensible and a tad shy.  This one is about the sibling who is very cautious; smart in business, not so daft with her emotions.  It's this sibling who I always like best.<br />In sum, read the series.  But start with Margo (&quot;Daring to Dream&quot;) so you don't go out of order.	2001-08-22

It tracks 3 women who have to share an inheritance while grudgingly getting to know eachother.  Meanwhile, there's a serial killer on the loose.  The scenes with the killer were gripping, as were the romances each woman experienced.  This is one of my favorite Roberts books because I honestly didn't know the identity of the killer, yet when I found out, it didn't seem as ridiculous as the killer sometimes are.  Also, the passages which takes you into the killer's head actually did kinda scare me.<br />Whether you like romance books or not, this is a good read.	2001-08-22

Sure, there's background characters that question the love affair, and you do get a sense of the reluctance that the main character feels, but it's really only 2 dimensional.  I bought this book to read on an airplane, and really that is all it's good for.  It's not particularly funny, or the characters particularly thought-provoking.

Picture being able to follow Joan Crawford or Bette Davis around, finding out all the secrets they hold about Hollywood actresses, writers and dirctors, their kinky habits and glamourous lives.  That's what Nora Roberts does in this novel -- she creates that world for you.<br />My only gripe with the novel (and reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars) is that I was able to predict the killer, and I'm not fond of how the book ended.  Still, the romance was lovely (as expected from any Roberts book) and the Hollywood backround fabulous!	2001-08-22
US	43079307	RB2BC0CG1MVKI	0684843161	123160711	A RETURN TO MODESTY: Discovering the Lost Virtue	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A good addition to any woman's studies library	This book was written by a young (I've heard) virginal woman, and it's basically her call to modern woman everywhere to  examine the sexual revolution and it's results.  She thoughtfully questions the rush these days for women to explore their sexuality, and also sex education in schools.<br />Some people have called her a prude, because she seems to long for the days when men were considered women's protectors, and society guarded women's chastity with some pretty sexist results.  But that would be altother a too simplistic view of what she has to say.  The book should be read with an open mind.  Shallit makes some very valid points, like how girls today seem more embarassed to admit romantic intentions in the same way they once seemed embarrased to admit to sexual thoughts and feelings.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who interested in women's issues and particulary anyone interested in a critique of our increasingly sexual society.	2001-08-22
US	43079307	RM1F8XEACNIFP	0689829574	719730821	On Fortune's Wheel	Books	5	2	4	N	N	My favorite young adult novel	I've read teen novels by Judy Blume, and I've read adult romances by Nora Roberts, and this is hands-down the one I've kept through the years from either genre.  It's a must as a love story; it's about lords and ladys, inn-keepers and slaves -- it's a magical adventure that young or old can appreciate.  My book is worn out and dog-eared from reading, but I refuse to give it up or away.  It's got all the romance of movies like &quot;Ever After&quot; and &quot;Princess Bride&quot;.  I'd put it in every children's library and I plan on giving it to all my future daughters and nieces.	2001-08-22

Schlesinger explores many things, including inclusiveness in History texts regarding minorities, the use of hyphens when describing ethnicity (African-American, for example) and particularly, the fragmentation of ethnic groups in America.  This book was utterly thought-provoking.  I don't agree with everything Schlesinger says, but I'm rather glad I read it.	2001-08-22
US	43079307	R1BP108ZPDOHJ2	0425162443	139645956	The Rapture of Canaan	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A fantastic read	A powerful, exciting book that I couldn't put down.<br />This is a book about Ninah, raised in the community of her Grandpa Herman, a man who preaches Fire and Brimstone services (in  other words, religion to the extreme).  Ninah is raised in this harsh environment only to find herself attracted to James, her prayer partner.  She does everything she's been taught to fight it, including punishing herself physically, but nonetheless, she ends up succumbing to her feelings.  The consequences are gripping.<br />This is definately a worthwhile read.  Just block out some time for yourself, because you won't be able to put it down.	2001-08-21
US	43079307	RNQIXG4HTB134	037570731X	22798973	The Ladies' Man	Books	3	1	2	N	N	nice read, but not my favorite Lipman	This was an enjoyable read.  The characters are funny, engaging and familiar.  The story is primarily about 3 sisters who have all settled into spinsterhood and live together.  Then this guy, Harvey Nash, a true ladies man, comes back into their lives, supposedly seeking forgiveness from Adele, the sister he'd left at the alter many many years ago.  His presence ripples into their supposed contentment, with intriguing results.  Nothing truly sensational happens, just a series of related events that kind of fold into eachother.<br />This isn't my favorite Lipman, but it's not because it's written any worse or the characters less engaging than those in &quot;The Inn at Lake Divine&quot; or &quot;Isabel's Bed&quot; (my two favorites).  It's because the characters were simply older, and their story less familiar.  Therefore, it was more a glimpse into the lives of others only, rather than something I felt I could immediately relate to.<br />Nevertheless, I definately recommend it.	2001-08-21

Fire is a man with his roots in Jamaica who meets Sylvia, who is cautious to fall for anyone.  The chemistry between them leaps off the page, and I found myself absolutely devouring this book.  Fire is incredibly sexy, and I was completely impatient for Sylvia to fall madly in love with him.<br />It would be easy to write this book off as another dime store romance, but that would really be selling it short.  Colin Channer's writing style is so engrossing and detailed, and just lush that you're wisked away into his world, and you really don't want to leave.  The bulk of the book is set in New York and London, but the best parts (including the fabulous ending) are in Jamaica.<br />Definately give this book a try.  But I warn you, the men around you may soundly seem lacking after you're finished.	2001-08-21

I really liked it, and thought Sinclair showed a lot of courage in allowing Stevie to explore her sexuality in this way.  Stevie's innocence is gone, but she's making choices and figuring things out on her own in much the same way she did in Coffee.  Though this book may seem foreign to anyone who didn't grow up in the 70's, the feminist movement &amp; post-60's San Francisco are so apparent in pop culture and history books that it will feel familiar none the less.	2001-08-21

As she goes through grade school through high school she starts questioning her parents mores, and figuring out how to deal with early encounters with interracial dating....<br />This book is also peppered with great bits of humor, including \\"Growing up reminded me a little bit of Hide and Go Seek. When it was your time to grow up, Nature said \\"Here I come, ready or not.\\" And nature could always find you.\\"  This book will tell (remind?) you what it's like being a tomboy..., or first learning what a virgin is.  Highly recommended.	2001-08-17

After reading this, I felt the same way I feel coming out of a great romantic comedy movie, all warm and fuzzy inside.<br />The book follows Natalie Marx who becomes intrigued/obsessed with an Inn who, when she was a child, did not allow her family to vist because they were Jewish.  Natalie whowever, manages to find a way into the Inn through non-Jewish friends, and her commentary about the Inn and it's visitors, and the family who graciously allows her to vacation with them is hilarious.  (And the gentile hottie Natalie becomes involved with is a pretty cool storyline too).<br />The back of this book contains a quote from the Chicago Tribune calling it a &quot;punchy little comedy of manners. . .Think Jane Austen&quot; and although way too many female authors get compared to &quot;modern-day Jane Austens&quot; this description actually fits.  I highly recommend this book.	2001-08-17

I've read Sinclair's other books, (Coffee will make you black &amp; Ain't gonna be the same fool twice) so I really thought I'd enjoy this one.  But I found the characters unintersting and utterly contrived so that the author could just spout her agenda.  She moralizes everything, from spanking to teenage pregnancy.  Afterwards, I felt as though I'd been cheated out of a good story because the author just wanted to rant about what she didn't like about society today.<br />If you're a April Sinclair fan, don't expect much.  If you're new to this author, read Coffee Will Make You Black.  Sooooo much better.	2001-08-17

MUCH has been written about welfare, but rarely has anything been written regarding how welfare recipients see themselves and the system.  Therefore, this book is a must for anyone who thinks they know everything about how the welfare system operates, or how it should be run.<br />The book starts off with Funiciello's experiences as a welfare recipient, including her decision to go on welfare, and her attempts to find a job which should have been able to break her out of it.  She then talks about her experiences with a welfare rights organization in New York.  She tells stories of women who were trying to navigate their way through the welfare bureaucracy with varying amounts of success.  She then goes on to give her opinions about what is wrong, and why we have yet to come up with a satisfying solution.<br />This book was a breath of fresh air for me, and forced me to reconsider much of what I thought about welfare, it's role in society, and the treatment of its recipients.	2001-08-14

More than just a bi-racial story of a black man and his white mother, this was a book about a women's determination and strength.  McBride's tale of how his mother single-handedly raised him and his siblings through poverty, substandard schools and housing was truly uplifting.  I am deeply grateful that McBride shared his story.	2001-08-14
US	43079307	R21M5N5OI9KK5Y	0385319207	10089389	One True Thing	Books	5	1	1	N	N	made me cry	I personally loved this book.  Ellen was easy to relate to as a woman who long ago left home and returns hesitatingly.  It's not until she goes home that she realizes how little she knew her mother.  But her mother isn't the only important parent in the story -- I felt that Ellen's relationship with her father was particularly poignant as well.  Ellen clearly idealized her father, which she also comes to question in this novel.<br />This is a really good book for exploring that weird, complex mother daughter bond, particularly if you're someone who finds your mother exasperating.  After reading it, you may want to get to know her better.	2001-08-14

I particularly felt akin to Gwen, because she is the character I understood the most.  However, she was the only character I understood.  I<br />I wished I had known more about March and Hollis when they were younger, then maybe I'd understand who they were when the novel begins.  Since I didn't, I felt like I was simply observing these sad, morose creatures completely screw up their lives.  And since I didn't know why, I felt very unsymathetic towards them.  And therefore, I just couldn't enjoy the book.	2001-08-13

Both before and afterwords, I read other books about twenty-something single neurotic women.  Since I actually don't smoke incessantly and am completely non-weight obsessed, many of Bridget's qualities were more annoying than anything.  But you just gotta love Bridget no matter what.  In the movie, this is played out full-force, making Bridget more loveable than she is in the book.  As heroines go, Bridget is adorable, light, and eternally optimistic.  If you're looking for something a little darker, more realistic vision of loneliness, check out In the Drink instead by Kate Christenson.<br />But if you're going to read the book and see the movie, the rule of book first does apply here.  The movie really just picks up on Bridget's sunnier, more laughable qualities.	2001-08-13

I can only say the story of this geisha and her life and love of one man still resonates.  The world Golden places us in, of jealous women and beauty, of selfish men, and undying love is just masterful.  If you're looking for a satisfying romance and a beautiful epic that is both lengthy but easy to read, this is your book.	2001-08-13

You've probably read the first one and are just worried that the second may be monotonous and redundant.  Well, it's a little redudant, but in a thoroughly enjoyable way.

I read the whole thing on a rainy Sunday, even though I really should have been studying.	2001-08-06

I was engrossed immediately into Maximiliano and Delores's love affair, and I too wanted to dance the danzon.

Diana's comments about the men in this town, and the southern power influence over it were right on target, so if you're in the dating scene in DC, you'll especially enjoy it.<br />Otherwise, it's still a great book.  Diana is forced to make that classic decision of security v. passion, but it's not the typical gorgeous/dangerous v. serious/rich plot.  Bartolomeo's characters are more dimensional than that, and Harry (the passion guy) feels like that guy best friend that you want to protect.  And Diana's sisters are hilarious.<br />All in all, a really good read.	2001-08-06

But The Bluest Eye really spoke to me.  This story is hearbreaking and painful, yet I still couldn't put it down.  It's been a long time since I first read it, but the image of a young girl wishing fervently for something so attainable, and the commentary on racism and beauty that Morrison is able to make through the girl is truly breathtaking and demonstrates that Morrison is one of the finest writers of the 20th century.<br />If you want to read Morrison, but was put off by her other works or becasue you never really figured out &quot;Beloved&quot;, read this one.  In my opinion, it's her best.	2001-08-06

It helps to explain why women do strange things like wear high heels or &quot;exfoliate&quot;.  This book won't make many feminists happy, which may be as good a reason as any to read it -- it provides much information to use when contemplating if beauty should be used as a source of power, something feminsts seem to be reluctant to embrace.<br />Read it.
