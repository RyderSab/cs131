But, the plan really does work. However there are many things he neglects to say. For example, it is common to stall for a while after induction while your  body adjusts. Also, many foods have hidden carbs. The diet works, but find  low carb support groups on the Internet to help you fine tune it.	2000-04-22

After the pathetic &quot;Hornet's Nest&quot; and some pretty lame Scarpetta novels, this book is a pleasant return to the forensic heroine. And it was refreshing not to have to listen to the painfully bad Marino dialogue. The storyline is much more focused than previous novels. The ending was abrupt, especially the acceptance of Mark's death. But, all in all, it was pretty good	1997-08-08

I can't imagine more adventure being packed into a single novel. The story is so wild that it strains credibility, but that's part of the fun. It's not great literature, but it's highly entertaining.

I really did laugh at loud at this not-to-perfect heroine. It was refreshing to read about a character with real-life problems such as having to sell odds and ends to pay off bills. The grandmother character is a genuine hoot. I want more. Thanks Janet for a great read	1997-04-09

A Grisham fan, I was very disappointed by this dismal effort. There was no real impetus to root for any character. The book is like a slow ride downhill. You can see the ending, and there is no thrill. I kept waiting for 'the good part'. A nice little twist at the end.....but it's too little, too late	1997-03-15

Joe discovers new evidence in the airline crash that killed his wife and daughters. The book rolls right along, until you find out the secret behind the crash of the plane, and the mysterious survivor of the crash. The answer comes down to vague, new Age mystical mumbo-jumbo.

King transcends his typical 'let's create monsters' formula to pen an epic story of human nature. Is there anyone who hasn't considered what would happen to society after such an appocolyptic event? The character of Nick was beautifully drawn. I still feel the pain over what happens to that character. Read this book. It's not quite like anything else I've read	1997-01-24

I did, however, expect to find a measure of the skill and outstanding writing demonstrated in those books. I had to force myself to finish this book, and I wouldn't have bothered if the author had been anyone else. I got a little confused by all the strange and unconvincing story lines. The only mildly interesting part was when a character gets gangrene after shooting himself in the rear end. That's pretty pathetic	1997-01-24

He could have trimmed about 200 pages from the last third of the book. But, it's worth it--read this one	1997-01-24
