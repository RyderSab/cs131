In the ninth installment of the Vlad Taltos series, Vlad must, again, rescue his friends Morrolan and Aliera.  But this time it is the Jenoine he must rescue them from--the creators of Dragaera!<br />Issola is a good book--and satisfying.  I know many fans were unhappy with recent installments of the Taltos series because they felt Vlad wasn't evolving as a character.  Never fear, my fellow Taltos fans, Vlad does indeed evolve as he faces his most challenging adventure yet.<br />Lady Teldra, Morrolan's &quot;door greeter&quot; at Castle Black, plays a big role in this book.  The interplay between Vlad and Teldra offers fascinating new insights into Vlad's friends including major revelations about Lord Morrolan--revelations that will shock you.  New information is revealed about Sethra Lavode and the Necromancer as well.  Teldra also helps Vlad realize things about himself.  And because of this relationship and the insights Lady Teldra offers, Vlad does indeed evolve.<br />The climatic battle at the end of the book will surprise you.  Something major happens, something that has been hinted about in earlier Taltos novels (Hint: It involves Vlad's magical chain, Spellbreaker).<br />This is one of the best Taltos novels.  There are some big surprises in Issola.  The next step in the evolution of Vlad Taltos is taken.  And it's a big step.	2001-07-31

The Black Company saga continues as Lady, assuming that Croaker has died, becomes Captain of the Black Company.  She assembles legions of cast-offs and wannabes and molds them into a fierce fighting force.  Unfortunately, she unintentionally adds members of a mysterious murder cult to her ranks.  Ultimately, they will betray her and rob her of a most precious gift.<br />Good story and it is fun to finally have a Black Company novel told from someone else's point of view besides Croaker (the Silver Spike did this but is it really a Black Company novel?).  Lady tells the story and author Glen Cook does an excellent job of distinguishing her from Croaker.<br />Be warned: The murder cult portrayed in this novel will give you nightmares.  It did me.<br />Tired of Tolkien-esque epic fantasy?  Does it all read the same after awhile?  Try Glen Cook and the Black Comapny novels.  Good stuff.  Dark fantasy told from the soldiers' point of view.  The first one in the series is titled the Black Company.  Shadows Linger is second followed by the White Rose, the Silver Spike (even though this one doesn't deal with the Black Company directly), Shadow Games and then Dream of Steel.  Bleak Seasons, She is the Darkness, Water Sleeps and Soldiers Live finish off the series--so far.	2001-07-14

If you have just about had it with epic fantasy and it's mockery--it's parody--of J.R.R. Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings, give Glen Cook's The Black Company a shot.<br />This ain't no weenie fantasy novel.  No Gandalf, Frodo and Aragorn clones here (Robert Jordan and Terry Brooks take note!).  This is a novel about realistic characters.  Characters who aren't evil nor good.  They're both.  Like real people.  Like you and me.  They are colored gray, not black or white.<br />The novel follows the misadventures of a group of mercenaries.  The story is told through the eyes of Croaker, the doctor/annalist of the mercenaries.  It's a fascinating little romp--at times, very dark in it's imagery.  But it is realistic.  There are no knights in shining armor riding white horses to save the day.  There is just a bunch of mercenary soldiers trying to make a buck.<br />These are guys like you and me.  Just trying to the best they can--sometimes they fail, sometimes they succeed.<br />If you like fantasy authors Roger Zelazny and Steven Brust, you'll love Glen Cook.	2001-05-09

And I wasn't disappointed at all.  The story is fast-paced and exciting.  The primary character, Prince Corwin, is cocky and irreverent but basically a  good guy.  He struggles against his brothers for control over the one, true  reality: The magical realm of Amber.<br />If you're tired of epic fantasy with  it's too-serious nature and pompousity, I'd recommend Nine Princes in Amber  (the first of ten in the Amber series).  It's good stuff.  If you like  Steven Brust, try Zelazny.  It's clear that Zelazny influenced Brust's  writing.	2000-06-27

We get a look at Vlad from an outsider's point of view.  Some readers haven't liked this different approach but I think  it's a fascinating way at giving us an alternate perspective of Vlad, warts  and all.  Athyra ends up being a strong novel, just as good as any of  author Steven Brust's previous Taltos novels.  I do wonder if, like Vlad,  Steven Brust is having a difficult time deciding on which direction to take  Vlad next.  That's fine, though.  I'm just as happy to read about Vald  Taltos the Wanderer as I am to read about Vlad Taltos the Assassin.  The  progression and growth of this character still fascinates me.  Where will  Vlad end up next?  Who will he end up becoming?  This is a fun  ride!<br />Note: Chronologically, the Vlad Taltos novels go in this order:  Taltos, Dragon, Yendi, Jhereg, Teckla, Phoenix, Athyra, Orca.  I'd start  with Taltos even though Jhereg was written first.	2000-06-27

The main character, Orion, was created by powerful god-like human beings from the far future.  Orion is a tool of these god-like beings, specifically, one that Orion calls the Golden One (aka  Apollo).  Orion is tired of being a pawn, he wants to forge his own destiny  and choose his own life but the Golden One won't stand for it.  It's any  interesting novel as Orion tries to thwart the Golden One's plans of  rewriting history during the Trojan War.  Orion doesn't do this out of a  sense of right or wrong (even though he is a generally good guy) or to fix  the timeline.  Orion does this to hurt the Golden One because Orion is  tired of being used, he wants his freedom.<br />Vengeance of Orion indeed.<br />I  like this book because we see a character resisting fate and destiny.  Even  though this is science fiction, I do get tired of fantasy characters  accepting their fate as they are drawn into a destiny they MUST fulfill.   Vengeance of Orion is refreshing.<br />Note: This is the second in the Orion  series.  Orion was the first novel and Vengeance is followed by Orion in  the Dying Time.  There are five books in this series thus far but, as of  this writing, I've only read the first three.  Good stuff.	2000-06-15

This time, they send Orion on an errand to save mankind before it  is wiped out by the maddened alien pseudo-god Set.  Though Orion hates  being the Creator's lackey, he realizes that if his mission fails, humanity  (which includes himself as well as the Creators) will be erased from the  time-line.  Orion then finds himself battling the minions of Set back in  the time of dinosaurs.  At stake is his very existence.<br />This is a good  sci-fi novel that deals with gods, eternity, time travel and destiny --  something Orion constantly tries to thwart, in one form or the  other.<br />Orion hates being a slave to fate.  Can't say I blame him.	2000-06-15

In Steven Brust's sixth novel of the Vlad Taltos series, our &quot;hero&quot; (Vlad Taltos) attempts to come to terms with his role as an assassin, his &quot;racism&quot; and his job as a crime-lord.  Vlad  begins to realize that, perhaps, what he does for a living is wrong.  He  then confronts his weaknesses head on.  Add to this the fact that everyone  in the book is trying to kill him and you are in for the ride of your  life.<br />If you want to try something new and you are tired of all the  J.R.R. Tolkien clones that make up epic fantasy today, give Steven Brust  and the Vlad Taltos novels a shot.  This is irreverent &quot;epic&quot;  fantasy.  And thank goodness for it.<br />Note: I would start with the first  Vlad Taltos novel, Taltos, and continue with Dragon, Yendi, Jhereg, Teckla,  Phoenix, Athyra and Orca.  That wasn't the order they were written in but  it's the order in which they take place.	2000-06-11

Though not as outrageously funny as the Nitpicker's Guide to Classic Star Trek, this volume had me, a grown man, giggling like a naughty schoolgirl (and that's quite a confession).  All the inconsistencies and plot  oversights are handled by a very sarcastic and wry author (Phil Farrand)  who knows how to make us laugh at a great but sometimes pretentious and  pompous TV show in Star Trek: The Next Generation.<br />I've had this book for  quite sometime and I still go back and read parts of it every now and again  when I need a laugh.<br />This book is for the serious Trekker (or Trekkie)  who can take a joke.	2000-06-11

It helps that two of the novel's three  authors are scientists as well.<br />Fallen Angels focuses on a U.S.  government that has been taken over by socialists and anti-technology  environmentalists (Al Gore anyone?).  Individual rights and freedom of  choice are no longer priorities in this new regime.  It's more important to  get rid of technology that may be (or may not be) harmful to the  environment.  The only problem with this is that when one puts a stop to  the advancement of technology, one also puts a stop to human achievement  and the human spirit.<br />And who are the protagonists of the book?  Science  fiction fans.  Now that is worth the price of the book alone.	2000-06-09

The setting for this wondeful fantasy adventure novel is Dragaera, the same world that the Vlad Taltos novels take place in -- except The Phoenix Guards is set about 1000 years before Vlad Taltos is born.<br />Steven Brust  gives us a fine novel that pays homage to Alexander Dumas and The Three  Musketeers.  Political intrigue, high adventure, friendship and romance are  all woven together to create a fantastic story.  The characters are all  well-realized and each has his or her own unique personality.<br />This book  was fun to read.  This novel, though set in a fantasy world with dragons  and magic aplenty, reads more like an adventure novel, which is just fine.   Steven Brust is an excellent writer and The Phoenix Guards is an excellent  book and Brust breaks those stuffy epic fantasy cliches, thank goodness!	2000-06-07

What we get with Jhereg, Brust's first Vlad Taltos novel but the fourth chronologically, is a story of deceit, politics and assassination -- all with a sarcastic wit.  Brust is a unique fantasy writer with fascinating stories to tell.  Vlad Taltos is a unique fantasy &quot;hero&quot; and you'll love him.<br />What more could a fan of fantasy ask for?<br />There are eight Vlad Taltos novels thus far.  They weren't written in order but I'll list them in chronological order for you because I'm a nice guy: Taltos (I'd start here), Dragon, Yendi, Jhereg, Teckla, Phoenix, Athyra and Orca.<br />I told you I was nice.	2000-05-30

Want something new and different?<br />Put this in your glass and drink it.<br />Vlad Taltos is not your typical fantasy hero.  He ain't no farm boy  with a destiny to fulfill nor is he an apprentice to a mighty wizard blah,  blah, blah.  Vlad Taltos is an assassin and mob boss and most of the Vlad  Taltos novels are told from his point of view.<br />Dragon is the eighth Vlad  Taltos novel (but the second one chronologically).  In this one, Vlad joins  the military, fights in a famous battle and nearly gets killed a few times  -- all in the name of revenge.  There is no destiny here, no prophecy that  must be filled, this novel is about simple revenge, greed and not so  honorable honor.<br />This is epic fantasy turned upside-down and spanked on  it's bottom.  And it is great!  Steven Brust certainly puts the likes of  Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan to shame because Brust presents us with new  and unique fantasy.  It's epic fantasy with a sarcastic wit and very  fallible characters.<br />Hey, Dragon and all the Vlad Taltos novels are good  books.  Pick 'em up.	2000-05-26

He's surrounded by all these mighty warlords and sorcerers and noblemen yet he does not fear  pissing them off with his sarcastic wit and disrespectful comments.  It's  funny as heck!<br />Vlad Taltos is an assassin and a minor mob boss in this  novel.  There are eight Vlad Taltos novels in all and this one (Taltos) is  the best one to start with (even though it was the fourth written).  Good  book -- it turns your typical epic fantasy on it's ear.  Vlad is hired to  steal (he isn't a thief, he's an assassin!) an object for an  &quot;honorable&quot; warlord and a vampire-sorceress.  Somehow, this leads  to Vlad taking a trip to the realm of the dead.  All in a day's work, I  guess.<br />Good novel.  I really enjoy Steven's Brust's work and I think Vlad  Taltos is a most unique fantasy &quot;hero&quot;.	2000-05-26

People either think it is the best of the bunch or the worst of 'em (but they still like it).  Even the author, Steven Brust, has  stated that this is his least favorite of the series (which stands at eight  novels, so far).<br />I loved Yendi and it is one of my favorites of the  entire series.  Are &quot;hero&quot;, the assassin-mobster Vlad Taltos,  gets involved in a mob war with another mob boss who is moving into his  territory.  But, as the mob war escalates, Vlad finds a deeper plot that  could threaten the entire Empire.  Fun ensues!  Assassins and mobsters and  wizards, oh my!  What more could one ask for in a fantasy series?  The Vlad  Taltos novels are great fun and an interesting take on your  &quot;average&quot; epic fantasy.<br />Note: Yendi is the third novel (after  Taltos and Dragon but before Jhereg) if your reading them in chronological  order.  It doesn't REALLY matter what order you read the Vlad Taltos novels  in but, hey, I'm being helpful.	2000-05-26

Robert Jordan does nothing new here with &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; as it applies to epic fantasy.  I've just about given up with epic fantasy because so many authors are pale copycats of the great Tolkien.  But, for  some reason, I liked this book.  No, it wasn't great.  And I'm still  bothered by one thing about epic fantasy: the destiny and fate elements --  and this book includes those.  Why are characters willing slaves to destiny  and fate, the enemies of freedom and individuality?  &quot;The Eye of the  World&quot; is no exception, many of the characters calmly accept destiny  (or enslavement, as I call it) with a shrug of the shoulders and a sigh.   Just once I would love to see a character say &quot;no&quot; to  destiny/fate...<br />But I liked the book anyway.  It was because the  character development was good and Jordan draws a good picture with his  words.  I admit, I had a difficult time starting the book but where I was  slow to start, I finished the novel quickly.  While Jordan is another pale  copycat of Tolkien, he's a good pale copycat.<br />And I'm looking forward to  reading the next book in the series.	2000-05-18

The book focuses on a military lawyer who has to defend a starship commander.  The commander is brought up on murder charges because he killed a fellow officer.  The commander did this because he felt that  the other officer was an alien.  Well, things aren't what they seem.  The  lawyer starts investigating the case and, right away, he realizes that  someone -- or something -- doesn't want the truth to be found.  I won't  tell you the ending but it is clever and quite shocking -- but  intelligent.<br />While this novel may appear like the TV series the X-Files  at first glance (it actually preceded that series by a few years), Resnick  adds his unique sense of wry humor to the novel.  This is refreshing  because it seems that many authors take sci-fi too seriously or not  seriously enough.  Resnick has found the perfect balance.	2000-04-03

I  still give it 4 stars because the first two-thirds of the novel is very  good but, to be honest, I almost gave this book 3 stars because the story  just didn't pay off.	2000-01-04

Cordelia and Geoffrey Gallowglass share the spotlight in this one as Geoffrey tries to  soften Prince Alain's character so that he will be worthy of Cordelia.  It  makes for a fun-filled, romantic adventure.	1999-12-30

Stasheff's Rogue Wizard series is a bit uneven and A Wizard in Chaos is on the ordinary side of the series.  This installment is a sort of amalgam of all the Rogue Wizard novels, we are given nothing new here except Magnus  finally sheds his annoying sidekick, Dirk.  It it a good novel for Stasheff  fans but isn't the author's best work.  All in all, a decent novel but it  could of used a shot of originality.	1999-12-30

The newest installment of the Rogue Wizard finds our hero on the brink of romance and perhaps true love.  This is the book I've been waiting for, a possible love interest for Magnus, yes!  As far as the plot goes, typical  Stasheff, which means it is a nice read.  To me, this is one of the better  Rogue Wizard novels, a series that has been a bit uneven.  I'm a sucker for  Stasheff's more romantic work (I loved M'Lady Witch) and this one delivers.	1999-12-30
