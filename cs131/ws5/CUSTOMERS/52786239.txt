There are many other books out there; from both conservatives and liberals; that analyze how and why things were done, but the book avoids that to just tell the facts.<br />Baker shows a tremendous ability to coherently present all sides fairly and let the reader decide for themselves how the process was.  He shows what happened, how and why it happened, and demonstrated quite clearly how both sides manipulated the public opinion for their own partisan ends.<br />This is an excellent read and well worth buying.	2001-04-18

Gergen; who was in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton administrations; writes about leadership as an insider.  This is not a memoir, a book about dirt, or a biography of any sort.  Gergen looks at the qualities of each President and shows how they exemplified leadership.  His analysis is first-rate and he weaves examples that shows both the positive and negatives of leadership seamlessly.  I do not agree with his politics, but this is a well-written book and well worth buying!	2001-04-18

I have read all four Harry Potter books and find them fascinating and quite fun.  It is an easy read for me; I am 23; but it is also full of all sorts of fun and goodies.

Contrary to what many people here have stated, this is an excellent study of Sino-American Relations.

This is well worth reading and buying.	2001-04-02

Kessler not only praises the FBI when it is warranted, but he also critiques it and exposes some problems.  The book alternates chapters between looking at various field offices; ie Baltimore, Dallas, and others; with a look at the various departments within the agency; ie criminal profiling.  It is informative, easy to read, and fun.  If you want a look inside the FBI, read this book.	2001-03-02

Baker writes a massive book seperated by area of work; ie one chapter on Eastern Europe, one on the Persian Gulf War, etc.; which causes a little confusion in terms of the timeline, but it is easily sorted out.  The one massive flaw is that he makes virtually no mention of Vice President Quayle and some others in the foreign policy process and absolutely lionizes himself.  While I realize that this is a memoir, and as such is meant to build up the author, but this seems to go a bit over the edge.  IF you want to find out how Baker thought and worked, this is an incredible book.  If you are looking for history, read this with many other books.	2001-02-27

However, he gets some facts wrong; especially in the area dealing with Congress. For example, he says that the Majority and Minority Leaders are not elected by the people.  This is a false statement.  The Leaders are elected to the Congress by the people, and are installed in these particular positions by their colleagues.  To make the claim he makes is misleading and false.  He also provides no substantiation for other claims he makes.  He says that there are party workers on the federal payroll.  THis may or may not be true, but he provides no evidence to back up the claim, he merely makes it.  The book has some good ideas, but taken as a whole it is deficient.	2001-02-26

Simpson Case	Books	2	10	20	N	N	Ok....but rather dissapointing	This book is part biography, part critique, and partly the story of a trial.  Dershowitz writes a good book, but it seems to be somewhat flawed.  Since he is writing to justify his defense of OJ Simpson; as is obvious when you read it; he is unfair to the prosecution.  Admittedly, I did not watch the trial, but he excoriates the prosecuting team; and Marcia Clark in particular; while lionizing the defense.  The only time he ever critiques the defense is on Cochran's use of bodyguards from the Nation of Islam; and even then he defends it.<br />Dershowitz also seems to see himself as a person who must single-handedly take on the &quot;powers that be&quot;.  He only uses information that bolsters his position without looking at both sides; as any truly fair book would do.<br />As I said, the book is good, but suffers from several flaws.	2001-02-02

IT is very readable and eminently enjoyable.  Celine talks about her youth in Quebec, her idols, her family, her rise to fame, her chase of Rene, and much, much more.  If you have been a fan for years, it is not much new, but it gives new insight into who Celine is.  If you are not really a fan, read this and see what the buzz is about.	2000-12-03

I first heard of the Heritage Foundation while at college when I read a booklet by analyst Dan Mitchell about the flat tax.  Intrigued, I started reading about Heritage.  When I got my hands on this book, I immediately devoured it. It is an eminently readable history of one the greatest; if not the greatest; conservative think tanks in America.<br />Edwards starts at the beginning when Ed Feulner and others wanted to found a think tank to get ideas and papers out fast and timely.  He follows through the troubled 70s into the triumphent 80s when Reagan became president.  HE looks at the ideas Heritage put forth and how it did not hesitate to criticize Reagan if he went wrong.  He follows through the Bush administration and into the 90s.  This, like Feulner's book about conservative thought is a must read for all conservatives!	2000-11-01

This was the first book I read that had been put out by the Heritage Foundation.  I had been a big doubter of the flat tax, but Mitchells arguments and facts showed me that I was way wrong.  He cogently argues that a flat tax is important for the economic well being of our country.  HE also looks at other tax plans and shows their flaws and merits.

I had previously only played a Malky, so when a friend gave me this book, I was intrigued.  Lots of history, ideas for how to play, and other goodies make this a real treat.  If you wanna have lots of fun in this game, be a Ventrue.  Allow the snob out!	2000-10-06

IN this first few chapters, I counted many, many historical errors.  Buchanan writes a book without a clue about real history and through a vastly distorted lens.  I used to say I would vote for BUchanan, then I read this.  Never again.	2000-10-04

Filled with behind-the-scene stories, photos, and advice, &quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot; is an incredible book.  Mick Foley; aka Mankind, aka Dude Love, aka Cactus Jack; is an incredible wrestler, and the book; though not stylistically the best; absorbs the reader and draws them into the world of pro wrestling.  If you like wrestling, you'll love this book!	2000-10-02

I personally prefer David Eddings, but this is a very well written set of books and worth buying if you are into fantasy.	2000-09-27

However, the author's constant justification of what she was doing and constant putting down of those who disagreed with her hurt the book tremendously.  I understand wanting to look good, but she carries it too far.	2000-09-21

Bob Woodward writes a nicely done book.  He lays out facts and fills in  the gaps with seemingly authentic dialogue.  However, this is another  example of his not allowing us to get over Watergate.  He made his  reputation on Watergate and he apparently will die before he will allow  people stop hearing about Watergate!	2000-09-01
