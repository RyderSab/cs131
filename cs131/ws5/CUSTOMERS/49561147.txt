The purpose is to gain a husband who will not only mind her lack of a dowry but will also secure the fortunes of the rest of her sisters and parents.   <br /> <br />Dominic Elliot is the youngest of five sons.  By day, Dominic will be escorting young Fleur around town, sponsoring her during her first season.  By night, Dominic catches criminals. His latest case involves a kidnappers called \\"The Cat.\\"  The Cat has been kidnapping young women from their families and gaining a ransom to have them returned with their virginity intact.   <br /> <br />This book has several problems:  (1) Dominic and Fleur have absolutely NO chemistry throughout the entire book.  Frankly, I did not see what attracted Fleur to Dominic.  He underminded her every move and doubted her ability to do anything on her own.  Fleur seemed too much of a free spirit for Dominic, and it was hard to see the allure.  This also made for a very boring book.  (2) The secondary characters got confusing as they continued to multiply. (3) I was not sure if I should be routing for the brother, Nathan, to win Fleur's hand or not.  (4) The mystery/kidnapping part of the plot was not fluid and really made me loose interest after a few chapters. <br /> <br />This was the first Stella Cameron book I've ever read.  She apparently does not do Regency much and it shows.  Definitely avoid this book.  It is not worth the time or the money.	2005-04-26

Captured by Robert Barrons and falsely acused and convicted of being a traitor, Captain Markham is hung for his crimes and finds his way to a strange light, after his death. <br /> <br />Lady Arianna Halverson \\"sees dead people.\\"  From a gift inherited through her mother, Lady Arianna is able to counsel recently dead people in order to allow them to cross over the other side.  After dinner with her brother, she first meets Captain Markham, who needs her help in enacting his vengence. <br /> <br />This book was very uneven and very much a first effort by the author.  The story really did not flow at all, from the moment Lady Arianna is \\"forced\\" to marry to the big fight scene towards the end.  As each aspect of the plot is revealed, it is obvious that it has something to do with Captain Markham.  Honestly, this book could have and should have been MUCH better.  I'm not sure if Ms. Labud will last past her first effort, if she does not improve her writing greatly.	2005-04-19

Four years earlier, Raney rejected Creed's offer of marriage because Creed is Indian.  Raney was taught to believe that Creed was not worthy of marrying her because of his ethicity.  As a result, when he offered, he was cruelly rejected by her and her family.<br /><br />Four years later, Creed is chasing down Raney's brother, who has been involved with some local trouble.  Raney follows Creed in order to save her brother from going to jail.  At this point, the attraction between these two reignite and Raney begins to understand Creed better outside of the influence of her father.  It is at this point that heroine stops acting like a child and grows into someone thinking on her own.<br /><br />I found the heroine of this story to be very selfish and had a very difficult time liking her.  She held a prejudice against someone that she has known for most of her life just based on what her father tells her.  I could not understand why the hero, Creed, would not have just moved on to a woman who was more mature and more willing to be a partner.  When Raney does finally stand up to her father, it is within the last 20 pages of the book and by that time, I was too far gone from liking her.<br /><br />I'm still a fan of Ms. Dellin. Her books to this point have always been entertaining and the heroine's strong.  This heroine did discover her strength slowly in the book, but her initial prejudice just turns off the reader from the beginning.  I would recommend the earlier installments of this series(THE LONER and THE LOVER).	2004-11-28

Brock left England two years earlier after a scandal that involved Amara.  Always secretly in love with Amara, Brock returns to England, upon hearing of her possible betrothal to another, in order win her himself.  Amara first sees Brock again in the gardens, while trying to avoid her current suitor.  Amara and Brock's begins again at this point. <br /> <br />This book is very difficult to get into if you have not read the previous installments of this series.  This was the first I read and I really didn't understand all of the characters until half way through the book.  The characters, while engaging to read about if you have read the other books, detracted from Amara and Brock's story.   <br /> <br />Amara and Brock's story does make you want to cheer for them.  The abuse Amara suffers at the hands of her parents is quite difficult to read, at times.  Also, when you learn of the brutality Amara suffered as a younger woman, you want her to find happiness and love with the man she has cared for.   <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend reading the other books in this tale before reading this one.  This one does not really stand alone very well.	2004-10-24
US	49561147	R3BPJDOV1F2Z9I	0843953918	663091895	Luke Ashcroft's Woman	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Disappointing	I picked up this new author based on what looked to be a good tale.  Charloette travels the Oregon Trail in search of a new life and \\"hooks up\\" with Luke Ashcroft along the way.  However, the actual tale is somewhat different.  First, Charloette's character is not easy to like.  She is headstrong to the point of irritating and never truly puts herself in someone else's shoes.  She never seemed to grow up along a trail that would have forced her to do so in reality.  I had a very hard time staying interested in her.  If it had not been for her protecting a slave, I would have written her completely off.   <br /> <br />Second, I really didn't know Luke Ashcroft at all.  We find out that his wife and son died, but not until mid way through the book.  Until then, we are lead to believe that his wife and son are still alive and that he is pursuing the \\"new widow\\" just for fun.  That made him seem sleezy and he could not really be redeemed for that. All of his other actions in the book were selfish as well, including locating Jacob.   <br /> <br />Thirdly, the secondary characters tend to dominate the story.  The most revealing is the material dealing with the slave girl and the interesting way their \\"owners\\" viewed her. It was almost as if the writer wanted to pack more stories into 200+ pages than she really could.  A little more editing of this would have been appropriate. <br /> <br />We missed out on a potentially good love story here.  It is very easy to not care about these characters early on and they never truly redeem themselves in this book.  I would pass on this book, unless you can get it very cheaply.	2004-10-21

He returns with the knowledge that he has inherited the Earldom of Egremont, a grand estate.  However, the Earls of Egremont do not seem to be living very long.

A former childhood friend, she befriends Christian in hopes of keeping her brother alive and to discover if he actually is the boy she vaguely remembers. <br /> <br />There is family intrigue and lots of \\"getting to know\\" you moments in this book.  However, something is missing from the main characters.  To me, there is a lack of passion between the main characters. The kisses were luke warm and the consummation was ho-hum.  I did not feel that this couple felt a burning for each other.  I also did not think that Christian did much to earn Julianne's loyalty so quickly.  This type of love may work for some readers though.  I, however, prefer more passion in my books.  THE RETURN OF THE EARL is my first book by Ms. Layton and will probably be my last.	2004-09-04

Gabby, being the modern woman she is, punches him in the face in order to escape.  The following 200 plus pages are just as fast paced, entertaining and full of spunk. <br /> <br />I literally finished this book in one day.  It was easy to read and easy to follow, even if you have not read the other books in the series.  Adam's story, for those of us who have read the others, has been the one worth waiting for and Gabby is his perfect match.  I highly recommend reading THE IMMORTAL HIGHLANDER.	2004-08-16

While he makes it seem that he is going to search the evidence on both sides of the argument, he does not.  This book only follows the journalist seeking answers from known theologians.  Not once does he seek out the people who contridict each argument, thus giving his book a very clear biasis.   <br /> <br />That being said, the book is very well researched and interesting to read, especially if you are a Christian.  This gives some very clear arguments as to the positive existance of the Son of God and His death for our sins.  I found the chapter on the medical evidence of Christ's death on the cross the most compelling of all of the arguments.   <br /> <br />THE CASE FOR CHRIST is a book you want to get if you are seeking answers about Jesus, however if you are looking for balanced reporting, this is not your book.  You will only find one side of the argument from Mr. Strobel's efforts.	2004-08-15

From that point on, Tessa is in love with Jered and, after two unsuccessful seasons, consents to marry him joyfully. <br /> <br />Once married, Jered flees to London after the wedding night.  Tessa follows him, determined to make their marriage a good one.  However, all Jered wants is a wife to give him an heir and leave him alone.  This begin Jered doing everything he can to make his wife hate him.   <br /> <br />Quite frankly, this tale is very difficult to read.  The heroine has absolutely no respect for herself.  She allows herself to be drawn into Jered's depraved world in order to get closer to him.  I kept wanting the girl to leave because this type of abuse is simply not worth it. Jered, if he feels any remorse about what he does to his wife, does not really show it.  However, he continues to bed her frequently.  Even when the heroine is gravely injured, Jered does not demand his way to his wife, but sits on the sidelines.  I did not think he was very well redeemed in the end, which also was a disappointment. <br /> <br />I hope that Ranney's other novels are better than this.	2004-08-07

All of the books were starting to take the same theme, and  it was hard to admit this to myself because I like Feehan's style so much.  However, DARK DESTINY renewed my interest. <br /> <br />Destiny was converted by a vampire when she was young.

In order to battle the vampire, Nicolae, who cannot find Destiny, teaches her how to kill vampires.....making her a hunter.  Nicolae eventunally finds her in the city of Seattle and the love story begins. <br /> <br />DARK DESTINY is fast based and very interesting.  It is the first time we see a female Carpathian battle the demons within.  It was interesting to see how Nicolae dealt with this unusual female life mate and how he adjusts to her.  Also, on a side note, I'm interested in reading the story of Nicolae's brother.  If you have found your interest in this series waning, please pick up this book.	2004-08-07

Francesa and John share their life with John's cousin, Michael Stirling.  Unbeknownst to both, Michael has secretly been in love with Francesa since he has known her.  He has disguised his love with rakish behavior.  However, one day, John has a headache and goes to lay down.  At the same time, Franscesa and Michael go for a walk, however when they return they find John has died.  Unable to cope with the death of his cousin, the miscarriage Franscesa has soon after and responsibilities of earldom, Michael flees to India.<br />Four years later, Franscesa is ready to remarry.  She longs for a child and makes her way to London a full month early in order to begin a husband search.  While seeking warmth in an unprepared London home, she discovers that Michael has returned.  At this point, the novel begins in truth.  We are taken on Michael and Franscesa's journey of accepting that they are allowed to move on after John's death and accepting that the two of them are perfect for each other.  It is actually Colin Bridgeton that plays an important role in making sure Michael understands that it is alright to move on and to love his sister.  (Nice appearance by one of our favorite Bridgeton!)<br />WHEN HE WAS WICKED is a very good tale for two different reasons.  Franscesa must learn that she may love again and that accepting that love is what her deceased husband would have wanted for her.  Michael needed to learn his own worth and understand that he was worthy of Francesa, even though she was his cousin's wife.  I completely disagree with the review that the book was weighed down with grief.  This was an important element of the book, to understand both characters and how they end up together. This tale is quick moving, with the dialoge that is always a must read in Quinn's novel.  No author does the prose of this time period better!	2004-07-03

Wolf has difficulty understanding why he is drawn to a white woman.  However, the author does a wonderful job in explaining both characters and progressing their story.  Not once did I feel that  love story was forced in any way.  It seemed geniune, up until the end.<br />A LOVE BEYOND TIME was an excellent adventure.  It is obvious that the author put in valuable research time, that definitely pays off in the story.  This book is definitely one of the best I've read of this genre.Even the ending, which can be difficult in a time travel, is without fault and completes the novel well.	2004-06-20

The hero professes to be in and out of love so much that he is weary of falling again.  However, when he does decide that Cassandra is the love of his life, he does not take the risk to secure her affection in return.  Cassandra is very annoying.  The character herself stated that she was shallow, and she was.  She rarely looked beneath the surface of anything she did, including her business of renovation.  <br />I simply have a hard time getting involved in a love story where there is no, well, love.  I did not feel that either party made a connection to the other.  The end of the novel was simply forced and appeared like Ms. Alexander just wanted to end this horrible book.  This was a very poor follow up to LOVE WITH A PROPER HUSBAND and THE LADY IN QUESTION.  Definitely skip this one.	2004-06-18

Wanting to get information out of Carlotta, Blake ties her up to a bed in his home and plans to interrogate her in the morning.  Caroline decides to take this opportunity to wait out her six weeks, and causes herself to become horse.  It is the arrival of James, the Marquis of Riverdale, when Caroline's true idenity is made.<br />Caroline and Blake set forth on their romance.  Caroline must overcome a past love for Blake, who was killed tragically in the line of duty.  Blake feels an overwhelming need to protect Caroline, no matter what.  The result is an entertaining tale, full of fun and an interesting end to the &quot;mystery&quot; part of the tale.<br />The dialogue that ensues between Blake and Caroline is just fast paced and very enjoyable.  This is Julia Quinn's trademark.  While not as good a read as some of her more recent work, this book is definitely worth the time and effort.  Afterall, Quinn's worst is 10 times better than another author's best.  If you read this, I highly recommend HOW TO MARRY A MARQUIS, Marquis Riverdale's tale.	2004-06-14

As a result, Lilith leaves the country, only to return ten years later as the owner of a gambling club called Mallory's.  <br />Gabriel, Lord Anglewood, is the leading crusader in Parliament against gambling.

However, from this point, the story looses the focus of the gambling crusade.  <br />Lilith does not trust Gabriel because of his broken promises in the past.  Gabriel does not trust Lilith because of her leaving.  This distrust follows the couple throughout the entire book.  Even though they have conversations about what happen, and seemed to resolve the issues, one party or the other continues to distrust the other.  This issue with the book weighs it down until the fun from the novel is taken away.  Added to that a side storyline where Lilith is threatened by a rival club owner, and I had a very difficult time keeping my interest in the book.<br />It is obvious from Ms. Smith's latest effort, INTO YOUR ARMS, that her skills as a writer have only improved with the novels she has written.

However, one (or rather) two things stand in his way.  His children.  Born during his \\"youth\\" James has two daughters, one nine-months and the other ten, whom he has taken on to raise.  Society is shocked by his daring.  Eventually, he looses the fiance and his influence.  Shaken, he retreats to his country estate in Yorkshire in order to take command of his children and life.<br />There we meet Phoebe.  Over the last eight years, Phoebe has been raising the illegimate daughter of her sister and taking care of her mother on their farm.  After her mother's passing, Phoebe and Helen (her niece) continue on, until one day, items come up missing.  Eventually, the theif is found to be Clarissa (Izzy) the eldest daughter of James.  Phoebe confronts Izzy in front of James, and thus begins our tale.<br />I had some problems with this book.  Although I admire the hero taking responsibility for his actions, I never really felt I knew who James was.  I understood that he was coming to love his children, but I did not understand why he was attracted to Phoebe.  <br />Phoebe, on the other hand, did not seem to be able to stand up to what she said very well.  Everytime she said no to James, she ended up going back on her word.  She did not seem to have a lot of respect for herself throughout the whole novel.<br />This relationship seemed only glued together by the children in the tale.  The couple essentially fall into bed together, while nursing the youngest child (she had chicken pox).  There did not seem any common goals or interest outside of sex and the children.  Not the ideal courtship to me.<br />I will not have this book turn me off of Ms. Becnel.  All of the previous \\"-maker\\" books have been very enjoyable and entertaining.  Hopefully the next book will be better.	2004-01-06

After finding him the &quot;perfect&quot; match, Meredith discovers that there is a mysterious curse shadowing our hero.  This curse will kill his intended bride two days after they wed.

However, she soon discovers that she falls in love with him herself.  Philip, a historian who would rather travel the world than run his estates, also finds himself drawn to Meredith.

He takes apart the arguments of Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and many other conservatives by challenging their own words.  When Mr. Franken actually confronts these individual about what they said, the usual response is negative.  The trip to Bob Jones University is VERY amusing.  Franken did not even bother to hide who he was during the trip.  <br />The best chapter, in my opinion, was the one on Paul Wellstone.  Very moving and a good send off for one of the most influential Democrats.  <br />Obviously, if you read this book, you are, for the most part, a liberal of some kind.  I challenge conservatives to actually read this book, before making a commentary on it.  Many of the reviews from the conservative camp make is OBVIOUS that you did not read this book.  But, then, that was the work of many of the &quot;liars&quot; in this book.  <br />Thanks, Al!  Can't wait for the next book.	2003-09-12

Literally.  After a long day of London site seeing, Maggie is ready to go home, however there are no cabs in sight.  Along comes a gnome-looking gentleman on a horse-drawn carriage, offering to give her a ride.  Little does she know, this ride is taking her back to Regency England.<br />Alex, after lecturing his sister on obtaining a husband, is bumped by a flying Maggie, who is unconscious from her journey.  After getting her to his home, Alex investigates her &quot;purse&quot; and find all sorts of 20th Century wonders, such as a driver's license, credit cards, and photographs.  When Maggie awakes, her speech and manner are both strange to Alex, and goes about making her fit into society.<br />This is the first time travel book I've read in which the 20th Century woman actually acts likes a 20th Century woman in her new time period.  Maggie is witty, smart, and has a mouth on her that is very helpful in combating Alex's gloomy demeanor.  She does not take the role of &quot;possession&quot; well, and this leads to sparks between her and her &quot;saviour&quot; Alex.  The story between Alex and Maggie is good, although at times a little rushed.  <br />I don't want to give the ending away because I thought it one of the best parts of the book, but what Maggie leaves for her sister is priceless, and made for a wonderful conclusion to the book.<br />I recommend this for a soft, easy read day.	2003-09-08

Patrick was the first to enter the \\"time travel.\\"  As we know from \\"Dance Through Time\\" Patrick went missing from his times prior to Elizabeth's arrival.  We learn, as Jaime does, that Patrick had been in the future, working as a mercenary.  What we did not know, was Patrick's ill-fated marriage.<br />Madelyn is escaping a fiance from hell.  After dumping her, she decides to take the Scottish honeymoon as a vacation.  Little does she know, her ex decides he still wants her, and follows to Scotland.  Once there, the ex causes Madelyn to (1) loose her hotel room, (2) loose her luggage, (3) loose her car, and the final straw (4) loose her violin.  Lucky for Madelyn, Patrick has taken notice, and after a bumpy beginning, looks to help her. GARDEN IN THE RAIN is for the comfort each character is getting from the other, during a stormy part of their lives.<br />The story development between Madelyn and Patrick is strictly character driven.  Outside of some kisses, there is very little sexual play in the book.  This makes you actually learn about the two characters.  Also, it was nice to catch up with Ian and his wife, Jane.  While we've seen more of Jaime since his story, we've had less exposure to Ian and Jane.<br />I HIGHLY recommend this novel.  It is helpful to you to have read Jaime's and Ian's stories prior to reading this book.  It is not necessary, but you will understand what is happening far more if you have these other two books behind you.  (Don't worry, Ian's is short and sweet.)	2003-09-08

Matt returns from England with Dark Champion, a race horse that has  had more than his share of controversy.  Upon his arrival to Diablo, Dark Champion, or DC as Matt calls him, smell the horse of Juliana Haines.  Juliana is the step-daughter of Edward Montgomery and the daughter of Iona Montgomery, who died early in the series.  Juliana has returned to solve the mystery of her mother's death.  She suspects foul-play due to a letter sent by her mother just before she passed on.<br />Throughout this story, we get what finally happened to Elizabeth Hunter, the mother of the clan.  Also, we find out why Jack Hunter went to prison.  I thought that the ulitmate demise of Kane, the hired killer of Edmond Montgomery's, was too easy.  However, the conclusion with Edmond was exciting.<br />The story of Matt and Juliana is good, although I would have liked to have known Matt a little better.  We find out why he has stayed away from the ranch, but we do not really know about his travels, outside of the England trip.  I thought Juliana was a very well written heroine.  She was tireless in finding out about her mother's death.  However, I do not understand why she did not see out Abby Hunter with more aggressiveness.  <br />Overall, this was an exciting end to a great series.  I hope these four authors get together again.  Also, I would like to see a story for the Marshall, who played out in three of the books.  The only complete disappointment in this book was the lack of Abby, when she was the most logical to be sought after by Juliana.	2003-09-05

The focus of \\"COMES THE SPRING\\" is capturing the Blackwater Gang.  We start off with the bank robbery scene, and the identity of the witness is a mystery.  Julie does a very good job in hiding who the witness is, until it is revealed.  <br />We finally get the story of Cole Claybourne, the most \\"rough\\" of the Claybourne brothers.  Cole is made into a U.S. Marshal by Marshal Daniel Ryan, who supposedly stole his compass from Mama Rose.  Little is known about the compass that causes Cole to search for Ryan, and this plot does not follow in the book.<br />I thought Jessica and Grace were very good heroines.  Jessica was really the perfect match for Cole, loving and in need of his care.  The baby, Caleb, was also very adorable throughout the book.  Grace was the exact opposite of Daniel Ryan's first wife, which proved to be a challenge to the Marshall to figure her out.  While I enjoyed the chemistry with Grace and Daniel, I was a little disappointed that Cole did not have a story all to his own.  I thought his character deserved more.<br />Overall \\"COMES THE SPRING\\" is a good end to the series.  I would recommend it to anyone who has followed the Claybournes since \\"FOR THE ROSES.\\"  Mama Rose's speech at the end did not bother me, as it did some reviewers, because we really don't hear a lot from her, but we know she has been behind the meddling.  Definitely read this book, it's worth the time.	2003-08-28

It is best to read &quot;For the Roses&quot; before you read these books, so that you understand the Claybourne family better.<br />&quot;ONE PINK ROSE&quot; is the story of Travis Claybourne.  Travis is sent by Mama Rose to pick up Emily Finnegan, and deliver her to her groom, O'Toole.  Emily is a headstrong girl, who Travis finds difficult to understand, yet intriguing to know more of.  While I enjoyed this first book, I did not feel that I really got to know either Travis or Emily.  Travis was the one brother in &quot;For the Roses&quot; that I never felt got as much attention as the others.  I was hoping for a little more insight into his character, other than his liking of debate and &quot;The Republic,&quot; which was already explored to some extent in &quot;For the Roses.&quot;  Overall, this book rates, in my opinion, a 3/5 stars.<br />&quot;ONE WHITE ROSE&quot; is the story of Douglas Claybourne, the quiet brother.  Douglas bought an Arabian horse six months prior, and finally has time to go collect the animal.  When he arrives at the home of Parker Grant, he finds Isabel Grant, his wife, giving birth.  Soon, Douglas discovers that Parker Grant has died, and Isabel is being harassed by the town bully.  The ultimate reason for the harassment of the bully is a surprise, and I won't give it away here.  By far, Douglas' story was the best of these three.  I felt that Isabel and Douglas got to know each other, and truly fell in love.  It seems that Julie Garwood took an extra liking to Douglas, and focused more on his story.  I give this book a 4/5 stars.<br />Finally, &quot;ONE RED ROSE&quot; the story of Adam Claybourne, the head of the Clayborne family.  This story was a complete disappointment.  I had expected more from this courageous leader, then a story not worth the effort to read.  I knew and respected Adam more when I first met him in &quot;For the Roses.&quot;  I hope one day, Julie revisits this tale, and improves it greatly.  Just skip reading this one.  0/5 stars.<br />If you are a fan of the Claybournes (as most Julie fans are) this series is a must have.  Read tibits of Adams' story.  Douglas' story is worth the effort.	2003-08-26

Johanna, the victim of an abusive relationship, is persuaded by her brother, Nicholas, to wed Scottish Laird MacBain in order to protect her from King John.  At first, Johanna is timid and frightened by her new situation.  She is recovering from a first marriage in which she was repeatedly abused, and taught to be the way she was.  However, when she hears her new husband's first name, she knows she will be safe with him. <br />MacBain has come to the aid of the McClaurian clan, after their Laird perished in a fight with the English.  After the English leave, MacBain becomes Laird of two clans, and must learn how to combine the two.  At this same time, Johanna, his new wife, is a mystery to him.  MacBain is a typical Garwood hero; strong, courageous and loving.  He is the perfect compliment to Johanna's character.<br />Johanna does not remain timid.  She grows under the love and freedom given to her by MacBain.  When she finally confronts her first husband with spuke, you want to appauld her for having the courage to do so.<br />I highly recommend SAVING GRACE.	2003-08-21

She also must protect her sister's children from becoming victims of the uncle, as well.  In order to accomplish this task, her grandmother weds her to Lucas Ross.  Ross is an American, desparate to return to America after obtaining his youngest brother from an English bording school.  He agrees to marry Taylor for the money to get his brother home.<br />Along the way, the story picks up many different characters, and has an added bonus of a side romance story.  Overall, I found this book a delight to read.  The love between Taylor and Ross is believable, and makes for one great story.  I highly recommend PRINCE CHARMING.	2003-08-19

This is only the second book from her that I have not enjoyed the hero.  It would be helpful to you to read &quot;Runaway Princess&quot; before reading this book.  It explains the background of Dominic a little better than this novel.<br />Princess Laurentia is looking for a husband so that she can continue her royal line.  Dominic declares himself first her suitor, and then her bodyguard after a blotched kidnapping attempt.  This book centers around the time of Laurentia's birthday, with most of the story moving within this time frame.  Ultimately, Dominic is after a &quot;secret&quot; from Laurentia in order to gain financial wealth, but ends up falling in love with her in the process.  <br />SOMEDAY MY PRINCE does not have a lot of charm.  I did like the heroine, Princess Laurentia.  She came across in a much more pleasant manner than the hero.  However, it was hard to believe that Laurentia would forgive Dominic so easier for his betrayal.    Ultimately, this book is worth the read, but don't be surprised if you are a longtime Dodd fan, and are slightly disappointed.	2003-08-15

The story begins with the heroine, Judith, attending a Scottish fair when she is five years old.  It is here that she meets her best friend, Mary Kathleen (also five) while battling a bee.  In this friendship is the grounding Judith needs in her tumultous life.  <br />Years later, Judith travels to Mary Kathleen in order to be present for the birth of Mary Kathleen's first child.  To fetch her, Mary Kathleen sends her brotherin-law and laird, Ian, who promptly belives that Judith will have to be taken by force to Scotland.  However, when he arrives, she is packed and ready to go.<br />The love story between Judity and Ian is amazing.  It's sweet and progresses with believable pacing.  The side characters of Brodrick and Ramsey set up another classic of Garwood &quot;Ransom.&quot;  However, it is important to realize that one of the main grounding points of this book is the friendship between the two women.  This is not a topic often discussed or talked about in a romance novel, and provides a nice change of pace.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2003-08-15

However, he redeems himself nicely in this book, as does Dodd herself.<br />Lady Alanna has been missing for four years.  Her guardian, Leslie Fairchild, forced her to hide among her own people so she could escape his plans to marry her.  On the eve of her 21st birthday, Lady Alanna returns to claim her home and heritage.  <br />Ian Fairchild, the son of the guardian Leslie, is looking for a home.  He has grown a lot in the seven years since we last saw him in a &quot;Well Pleasured Lady.&quot;  He still feels the sting of being born on the &quot;other side of the blankets&quot; from his father.  Little does Ian know that in finding Lady Alanna and her heritage, he also finds his own.  <br />Ian and Alanna's story is filled with humor and passion.  It is very obvious that Ian does not understand that he loves Alanna, and Alanna learns to accept that she needs Ian in her life.  The struggle between the two is fun to read.  I would definitely recommend this book to others, but still skip the previous book, &quot;A Well Pleasured Lady.&quot;  You do not need to read that book to understand this one.	2003-08-14

I read everything new she puts out.  I decided to start reading her older books, thinking they would be just as wonderful as her newer stuff.  With &quot;A Well Pleasured Lady&quot; I was disappointed.<br />Mary Fairchild, the heroine, barely stands up for herself against her hero, Sebastian.  This is unusual for Dodd's heroines.  After being forced from her home, after she murders a nobleman when she's a teenager, Mary works as a housekeeper in Scotland.  Sebastian, the godson of her employer, wants to use Mary to inflitrate her family to obtain a stolen diary of his godmother's.  To do this, they pretend to be brothed.  However, from the time they arrive at the Fairchild Manor, the two never pretend to be betrothed.  They act like it in reality. Since the whole premise of them infiltrating the Fairchild Manor was pretense, I would imagine that storyline being kept a little longer than one chapter.<br />The love scenes between the hero and heroine are forced.  Sebastian first forces Mary to kiss him, and ultimately forces her into intercourse on a wall in a jealous moment.  This is not a romance, in my opinion, and GREATLY retracts from the novel.  Once Mary said &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Don't&quot; several time, Dodd should have called her hero off, and redeemed him in the eyes of the reader.  Instead, Sebastian once again forces his heroine into marriage, so that he can ultimately control her.  Not a great hero, in my eyes.<br />Never in this book do I get the feeling that the heroine is truly in love with the hero.  I believed that the hero was obsessed with the heroine, but is that love?  Thw whole point of reading books like this is to escape into a world of two people falling in love.  It is hard to do that in this novel, when the two people do not really show signs of even liking each other.<br />I would discourage anyone from reading A WELL PLEASURED LADY.  If you are reading Dodd for the first time, you might get turned off of her better material, such as the Governess Series.  I will not be keeping this novel in my collection.	2003-08-08

There were too many stories running at once in their minds, and this hurt the main story.  (4)  The story is boring.

What will happen with the curse?  Will he return to his time period without his new love?  Will he die the death of a traitor to the British crown?  Does Susanna love him in return?<br />I love time travel books, however this one was not a pleasant experience.  Besides this book being dull, it is riddled with historical inaccuracies.  The author did not appear to put any actual research into her time periods, which truly detract from the book.  I would not recommend this book to anyone with any working knowledge of the Revoluntary and Post-Civil War eras.	2003-07-24
US	49561147	R2VX9P52QME8LG	0843950285	101707792	Lone Warrior	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Great Book!	Marissa Williams, New Orleans debutante, travels by stage coach to begin her new life with her Uncle George after the death of her father.  At a stage coach way station, Marissa survives a raid by a Comanche camp, however she is taken as captive.  She is given to Wind Ryder as a gift because of a vision the tribes Chief, and also Wind Ryder's adoptive father, because she is to bring peace to the tribe.  The surprise to Marissa is that Wind Ryder is a white man, taken as a captive as a young boy, and raised in the Comanche camp.<br />After denying his white heritage for years, Wind Ryder is surprised by the feelings Marissa (Shining Spirit) brings out in him, including a longing to return to the white world.  After the death of his father, and a battle with his adoptive brother, Wind Ryder takes Marissa and returns her to her Uncle and the white world.<br />Lone Warrior is a great book.  The struggle of Marissa at the Comanche camp and the struggle of Zach when he returns to the white world is written smoothly, with many supporting characters to make the book interesting.  I highly recommend this book.	2003-07-24
US	49561147	R1A76OSV7ICEF5	0505524988	918781493	Wanton Splendor	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Another Masterpiece from Smith	Christopher is a gambler who wins a southern plantation in a card game.  Kathleen (Katie) is a modern woman who feels trapped into going to Louisiana by her father's need to marry her off.  After Christopher hits her brother, Katie charges to her brother's rescue and gives Christopher a black eye.  Thus begins this tale.<br />WANTON PLEASURE is a book full a intrigue and daring.  Set in the pre-civil war Louisiana, the plantation way of life and the color lines are very much on display in this novel.  It is interesting to read Christopher and Katie's story, but it is also interesting the role the Underground Railroad plays.  If you are a fan of Smith, this is a must read.  If you are a newcomer to Smith, read this book.	2003-07-23

After a time, the plight of Adam Trask seems pathetic, and you start to not care about his outcome.  Samuel Hamliton is a strong force in the book, which is lost at his death.  The most interesting characters were, in my opinion, Charles, the brother of Adam Trask, who we do not hear from in the later part of the book, and Cathy/Kate.  Cathy's emotional detachment makes her dangerous and interesting, as she makes a life for herself.  <br />Ultimtely, I am pleased that I stuck with the book, but I would recommend Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men.\\"  Both of these novels are not such a chore to read.	2003-07-15
US	49561147	R39M49S00MK8OV	0425189058	493487073	Lover Beware	Books	3	4	9	N	N	Christine Feehan Saves this Book	I'm sure many people will be purchasing this book because Christine Feehan is on the cover.  Her part of this book is excellent.  Finally, we are beginning the story of the sisters, which she has been hinting at for over two years.  This is the story of Sarah, the eldest sister, and finding her \\"chosen one.\\"  Like all of Christine's books, there is family, humor, and an upcoming sibling book that I can't wait for (Hannah!!).<br />As far as the other three stories, I was disappointed.<br />Katherine Sutcliffe's \\"Hot August Moon\\" is a story with obvious beginnings elsewhere, and no end.  Anna and Jerry have a past, but it is not truly explored.  We know that they were once engaged, the engagement ended so Anna could pursue her career, and she finally returns.  The romantic interaction between these two character is small, as the story is focused on a serial killer.  Since there is no end to their story, I'm assuming there will be a new book that continues the tale.  However, I'm not that interested in the tale of Anna and Jerry to find out.  <br />Fiona Brand's \\"After Midnight\\" is better than Sutcliffe's section however the tale of Jane and Michael was very quick.  Basically, they've had the hots for each other for years, and due to circumstances, they have been unable to get together.  Finally, they get together and solve a rape at the same time.<br />Finally, there is Eileen Wilks \\"Only Human.\\"  By this time in the book, I must admit, I had really lost interest in the new authors, but I decided that I had gone this far.  I did not make it past the third chapter in this book.  The heroine is solving a case with a werewolf.  The plot and love story both bored me to tears!!<br />There is an extra treat, however, for Feehan fans.  There is a section of the upcoming \\"Shadow Game.\\"  This, plus her contribution to the book, is the only reason I purchased this book.  It was also the only good part of the whole book.  For Feehan fans, don't miss Sarah's story.  For the rest,just skip them.	2003-07-06

However, I'm glad I only paid half-price of this.  Outside of the first chapter, the book is boring.  &quot;Freddie&quot; barely stands up for herself.  &quot;Bentley&quot; was by far the best character in the novel, but I had a hard time feeling sorry for him, even after the &quot;reveal.&quot;  <br />I would recommend check this out from the library.	2003-06-30
US	49561147	R3HQA7KL6TSI36	0345453808	317621417	Killjoy	Books	3	27	34	N	N	Good, but not  Garwood Great	Like many other reviewers on here, I've been a long time fan of Ms. Garwood.  Her historical romances are fun, warm, and loving.  Once you read &quot;The Secret&quot; or &quot;The Bride,&quot; you don't forget the characters.<br />Over the past three years, Ms. Garwood has gone away from this genre, and into suspence-romance.  At first, I was excited.  One of my favorite authors was branching out to find a larger audience.  However, I bought her first novel &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and was greatly disappointed.  I wasn't going to give up on her though.  I bought &quot;Mercy&quot; and thought, this was a little better.  Finally, there's &quot;Killjoy.&quot;<br />&quot;Killjoy&quot; is really a story about the heroine's mother, Jilly.  This book should have been titled &quot;Jilly's Revenge.&quot;  The time and effort spent to her was vast, compared to that of the hero in the book.  John Paul, who we first met in &quot;Mercy,&quot; was not given fair justice in this book.  His military background was not explained fully.  We understand what initially drove him to move back home, but we don't understand why it took that last assignment to do so.  Also, it is unclear how this individual &quot;loner&quot; guy falls in love with someone very opposite of himself.  <br />Overall, &quot;Killjoy&quot; is an okay novel.  It isn't the great Ms. Garwood we've had in the past.  If you are just getting into Ms. Garwood, I would recommend her earlier work first.  Start with &quot;The Secret&quot; and skip these contemporary novels.	2003-05-30
US	49561147	R2FN4MSRTY0Q7D	0743452925	378094364	The Bride	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Reprint of one of Julie's BEST!	Okay, Julie Garwood fans!  This book is a re-print.  However, this is one of the BEST stories from Julie EVER.  <br />By order of the King, Jamie and Alec marry, but it is not exactly happily at first.  Alec refuses to call Jamie by her &quot;man's name&quot; and Jamie wears black to her wedding.  Through many twists and turns, Jamie and Alec learn to love and respect each other.  If you enjoy Mercy and Heartbreaker, see where Julie got her start with this EXCELLENT novel.  Also, you must read &quot;The Wedding,&quot; the sequel to &quot;The Bride.&quot;	2002-05-31
US	49561147	RXK0K60FUO0R5	0821771493	19602442	Beneath The Texas Sky (Zebra Historical Romance)	Books	1	46	54	N	N	This Book had Too Many Stories Going on at Once	This first novel by Ms. Thomas simply tries too hard.<br />The first half of this book is dedicated to only Bethanie.  It is her journey to escape her uncle, who (typically) lusts after her.  She presses Josh to help her escape, and falls in love with him.  Josh takes her to his brother's ranch, where she can begin a new life.  It is here that the plot and momentum of the book shift from a &quot;Josh and Bethanie&quot; story to a &quot;Bethanie and Ben&quot; story.  Through a decision made in haste, Bethanie and Josh are separated for three years before reuniting in a quick story that seemed, actually, too quick.  Frankly, most of the novel regarding Bethanie revolves around her involvement with Ben, not Josh.  <br />The second half of this book involves Bethanie and Josh's daughter, Mariah and a boy Josh brought with him from San Antonio, Dusty.  Again, this is a diversion of what the book states it is about.  I simply had a hard time understanding why the publisher sold this as a love story between Bethanie and Josh when it had more diversions from that story than the book simply could handle.  <br />While I am a Texan, and support Texas writers any chance I get, this book is not Ms. Thomas' best.  I would recommend skipping this book in favor of her more recent stuff.  This book simply tries too hard to include too many stories.  It would have been better to split the story about Mariah, and develop Josh and Bethanie's story without the diversion.  <br />This is the only book I have been disappointed with by Ms. Thomas.  I do recommend her other novels, just not this one.	2001-12-18

Although the plot around the killer was very good, something was missing in the love story between the two main  characters.  Another novel of Garwood's with a good plot, but with  character connection is &quot;Saving Grace&quot; or &quot;The Lyon's  Lady.&quot;  Either one of those would be a better start to see what Julie  is about then this new work.  Sorry Julie.	2000-07-18
