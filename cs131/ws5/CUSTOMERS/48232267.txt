The language is lovely, using aliteration often in Dexter's inner voice -he's a funny poet inside, if also a monstrous one. The whole situation is treated with such lightness and dry humor. Then ending was a little clumsily written, but still brilliant. I've been waiting so impatiently for the next book in this series. I'm torn apart that I gave my copy of this book away. On the one hand, someone else is now being hooked; on the other I don't have it to re-read anymore. On the one hand I did a good thing; on the other I'm frusterated... While waiting for the next book in the series to be paperbacked I might have to get another copy of this one so I can read it again.<br /><br />I'm also  deeply torn over getting the next book in harcover. I mean, I never get hardcovers on purpose, they take up way too much room.... but I wanna *read* it! Wah...	2005-09-24
US	48232267	RC78N087E62OL	0156011603	582044302	Under the Skin	Books	5	10	13	N	Y	Absolutely right.	I read, approximately, about 200 books a year. Most of these are brain candy, little easy books that feed my desire to escape and do nothing else. Most of the books written today are like that, a nice story and nothing more. I'd almost forgotten how it felt to read something like this. I wish there were another star I could add to my rating to show that this book really is something extrordinary. I think it has a perception of beauty; it made me want to cry.<br /><br />I'm deeply indebted to the other reviewers who did not give away the story, so I will keep my fingers quiet about the plot. Suffice to say that all is not what is seems, and by the time you have an idea of what's going on you've been slipped oh-so-silently into a perception of the world that is different than your own, and it is beautiful and funny and monstrous, and when you're done reading I hope you understood it.<br /><br />I'll be keeping an eye out for more by this author.	2005-05-07

The first book creeped me out - I went through an internal war between my trust for CLAMP and the deeply disturbed feeling the first book left me with. But I couldn't leave it alone, so I got the second book (this one) - ok, so now I understand what's going on a little better and I'm glad I bought this book . Normally I don't like it when the writer spells out what's going on - I like to figure it out for myself - but this book comes so close to some very delicate themes (closer than almost any other book I've read), that their spelling some things out actually relieved me.<br /><br />Many Japanese themes seem to deal with young girls in cute clothing, love, and danger as though it were all a big exciting joke. This one is so very different. It's well written, perfectly lined, perfectly plotted. what if someone truly innocent were in danger, and couldn't recognize it? The main character's innocence and trust for the world are so utterly complete, and her heart is so large and open, that she believes everyone around her is good and kind. You debate with yourself if this is a great and amazing gift, or a blindly stupid way of locking out fear - but you can't help wanting to protect her, worrying about her.<br /><br />This is not your average Japanimation story. The only thing I can compare it to, really, and then only in terms of sheer quality, is Jin Roh: Wolf Brigade (but they're really nothing alike at all. It's just that they're both so well done.)<br /><br />I'll get the third book now and see how it ends.	2005-01-30
US	48232267	R3KXZTDI4EFTRD	157646637X	417883956	The Armageddon Blues	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Good. Complicated. Did I mention good?	The first book I ever read over and over again... wasn't Daniel Keys Moran.  However, the first Sci-Fi book I read over and over again was a Moran book. Not Armegedon Blues... Emerald Eyes. All of which was years ago. Recently I decided to re-read the old favorites, and hit this one along the way since I'd never been able to find it before. So I got it, and read it, and really, really enjoyed it. It's sort of a kind of prequel to Emerald Eyes, but not really. It might be sort of in the same universe, or not. Anyways, it's very good. I liked the three computers, a lot.<br /><br />Plot.... well, that's complicated. See, the world ended. And then some aliens stopped by because their spaceship broke down. And then the girl ran away to the past, and the luckiest man alive met her... no, really, it all makes sense when you read it.	2005-01-10
US	48232267	RL4X2IPOKEDX0	0345462297	480568301	The Lost Steersman	Books	4	6	6	N	Y	Lyrical series	This is the third in the Steerswoman series. As with the first two, the writing is beautiful and the story is both thoughtful and interesting. These are intelligent books, easy to read; the characters are funny, smart, and tough in their own ways.<br /><br />Usually I have trouble with books based in the future that depict people's return to magical ways of thinking. This one, however, makes sense. Everything happens for a reason; there is a structure that functions very well. There is nothing gratuitous about the story, or the society; everything has it's reason. The conflict set up for the next book isn't a physical war, although that might happen as well; it's a conflict of morals and behavior.<br /><br />Rowan the Steerswoman is come to the Archives, looking for a man whom she has never seen. She has only his name and ocupation: he is the head wizard, the commander of the magic that shapes their world. The Archives are a secondary repository for copies of all the collected knowledge of the Steerswomen and men. The old keeper has died. The archives are a complete mess. Rowan has spent too long on strange roads in strange places, and no longer understands how to deal well with the normal people of her world.  And the lost Steersman, the lost friend, is found again; but he is already under ban for not answering a Steerswoman. His answers are strange and raise as many questions as they put to rest... Then things from the outer lands are seen in the inner lands.<br /><br />Anything else I say will be a spoiler, and you don't want this lovely book spoiled.	2004-09-26
US	48232267	RXTINW8AEQ4T6	042518207X	660819498	Out of the Shadows	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	Not what I expected.	Well. First off, these are not your traditional romance-book vampires. Oh yes, here we have a brooding &quot;Oh I'm such an unnatural horror, I don't dare touch her purity&quot; man, issue one; but the damnation in question is taken in a literal sense, with no doubt of the reality of a soul, or of God and heaven and hell and the place in all this of a vampire. These are topics that most romance books shy away from for fear of upsetting the story. This one includes them integrally.<br />So... not what I expected, but the first story is very lyrical and lovely. The second starts out more clumsily when you step straight to it from the first.	2004-06-06

Although the main character &quot;runs out of the room&quot; an awful lot. She's always running out of one room or another in fear. Oh, well...<br />Fairly untouched by logic or reason, full of passionate yearning and tormented souls. Very gothic. You should read the last story in Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's Saint-Germain Chronicles, a collection of short stories about Saint-Germain; it mocks this sort of broody vampire. Sorry, Vampyre.<br />I'm sort of making fun of this book, but then again I bought it and read it and went just as doe-eyed and sappy over the poor angsty hero as any fangirl might... Oh, well. Just goes to show I'm as silly as any other girl when it comes to big, brooding heroes with dark hair and soulful eyes.	2004-06-05

The art is ok, the plot is thin, the characters are irrational. There were a couple places I liked but all in all there's better Manga out there. And usually I like this sort of book... sigh....

It does have some bite to it in the end. And the idea that you can pick your family - that strangers can be more of a family than your own - that adds a bit of starch to this puff piece. I like it enough to get the rest though, and I can see why it's so popular.<br />Definitely good for kids, and for a starter. But older people will be interested too.	2004-06-02

I was hopeing for more. Thin on plot, thick on action, and it pulls the \\"Oh no I'm gonna get caught changing into my alter ego in public\\" thing one too many times. Maybe they needed something for filler, cause there's not much else to this one.<br />It's like a placeholder story, so they could have a cool title: \\"DNAngel\\" is such a cool name, they had to come up with something that they could use this cool name on. The \\"DNA\\" part is barely mentioned, and sort of pointless. It does nothing for the story.<br />I'll only get the rest of this series if I'm very, very bored and have too much money and have already bought everything else that was more interesting. So.... probably never.	2004-06-02

Very little of the cutesy silly cartoon stuff you see in other Manga.<br />The story is about growth and change... or maybe it's redemption and damnation... or maybe it's about being in love... or about values and survival... Or all that and more. It's very well done. I like when emotion is conveyed through action instead of long description; this does that. Definitely getting more when they come out.<br />Oh, what it's about? A demon King meets a half-angel. She's living by herself when she finds him bleeding on the sidewalk, and she asks him to stay. He's not a nice person. She is. It gets complicated really fast - Aparently angel meat is tasty, and angel spawn are hunted and killed by full angels, and the demon's family may not approve of him being king, and then there's his maid (the half-angel can't cook very well.) And the cat-boy who argues with the half-angel's best friend. Did I mention the Bogey Monsters? Or the ghosts, and the bounty hunter? No? Oh. Sorry. There you go.<br />Anyways, in the begining it's very spare and clean and surreal; the images are haunting. Then, towards the end, it gets a titch cluttered and confusing, but it's still good.	2004-06-02

I'm probably just a bad person or something, but initially I just get a sort of creepy feeling from it. Maybe you have to read the whole series to get it. Right now it's just disturbing me. I'm not saying it's not good; it's terrifically well written and drawn and told. I think part of the reason it's giving me the crawlies is *because* it's so well done. If it were silly, or dumb, it wouldn't be nearly so affecting. But Clamp - the quartet of women who write it - take their craft seriously, and it shows.<br />Initially it's about a very, very innocent girl who lives alone. A man moves in next door. She likes him...<br />The emptyness of the rooms, the teddy bears sitting on the floor to see her off and greet her; you can almost hear the silence of the house. That's what's giving me the shivers. Ignorance is not bliss. I'll probably have to read the rest of them or it's going to bug me forever.	2004-06-02

There's a straight story on the top, very plain and not at all simple. Then under that, there's Lois McMaster Bujold with her literary stick stirring up your brain, getting all these odd thoughts to come floating out. As she always does.<br />On the straightforeward bit, this is the story of a woman who was a minor character from The Curse of Chalion. She's spent the past many years of her life in a deep despair, a depression and suicidal misery caused by a curse and exacerbated once the curse was lifted by the death of her son. She's watched over by kind, loving people who give her no freedom, no privacy and no trust. She has no love; even her daughter is far away and almost a stranger to her, and no prospects of friendship in her situation.<br />So she goes on a pilgramage, to get out and get away; an excuse but also an invocation of the Gods of Chalion. And as the Curse proved, the Gods of Chalion are listening... The Bastard God answers her with some very interesting problems.<br />So that's the straightforeward bit. It's how she does it that you have to see, because her writing is so amazing.	2004-05-21

Great deamatic scenes were covered without any special attention : And then this happened, and then this happened, the end.<br />Great fantasy plot, could've been treated better. If the whole series were as strictly spare and dry as this it would be ok, but the first books were different. Consistancy doth a great read make, and this book was inconsistant with the rest of the series.<br />If it were a concious choice on the author's part to write a book in this style that's one thing, but the way the writing changed partway into the series it looked like she just got tired of it all and ground her outline out onto the paper. Like she just wanted to get it over with, was bored with the whole thing .<br />And it had so much promise....	2004-05-21

Yes, I'm leaving out a lot of the good bits (Laurel) but I don't want to be a spoilsport.<br />One reviewer compared this to Neil Gaiman's &quot;Neverwhere&quot; because of the &quot;slipping between the cracks&quot; lost people imagery. It's not a stolen idea, or if it was it was stolen from someone else a long, long time ago. It's a recurring theme in societies with large populations. There have always been and probably always will be people who just get lost. It's a frightening thing to us.<br />My opinion: I really liked this one. It's dark, but not obscure. The darkness in this comic is not gratuitous or unnecessarily violent or just there to get some emotions stirred up in people. It's crafted and placed and worked into something that's like wrought iron. And the themes in it; the things that people in despair think, the hopelessness; those are real things. The fear, the stories about going nowhere, those are real.<br />It's like holding two strong magnets with their oposite poles together. You see nothing but you can really feel it, like a shape made by that unseen force that has a texture. You expect your fingers to be able to touch it but there's nothing there; you can only feel how it's making the things you hold react. This story doens't put all the ideas in but you can feel them, taste them, see them by their lack. They are as clear as the patch of paper left unbleached when you take a picture off old wallpaper.<br />There's temptation and despair and anger, and a little humor. There's the dregs of your soul and what keeps you going even when you've got nothing left. Duty, but it's never named. It really touched some feelings in me. It's real art.<br />But like art, different people will see differnt things in it and some will see nothing at all; the art that will touch them is not the same as the art that touches me. I could say that some people will get it and others won't, but that sounds patronizing. And people throughout their lives change; someone might get it at one point and then not get it later... You see what I mean, and that's more a rant about art than about this comic in particular.<br />My favorite part is that for all the social themes there's not a hint of patronization or holier-than-thou attitude in the tone of this book, and I can smell that bull a mile off.s won't, but that sounds patronizing.

This is the sort of &quot;Law and Order&quot; or &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; you'd get. Only funnier. It reminds me of the new online game &quot;City of Heroes&quot; in a way, except I doubt the game has anything as useless as swelling up like a balloon as a power, or producing lots of sand all over the place.<br />Ok, so it's not gonna win any &quot;Most Dramatic New Comic of the Year&quot; awards. It's not grim, depressing, real, or awe-inspiring. It's fun and funny and tough and cool, and I loved it. It's well written, and well drawn, and a little bit raunchy (there are lots of hookers so it kind of has to be).<br />It's also totally accessable to almost everyone, which some of Moore's other work isn't. It uses the sort of TV style we're all familiar with to make it seem closer to us. I like it a lot. So it won't stay with me and haunt me like some of Moore's other stuff... but not everything has to haunt you to be good.	2004-03-25

Half the book is a comic, and a rather morbid and ribald sense of humor pervades that half. The other half is a travel guide to the world of the League, where everything fantastic you've ever read about is true. The adds in the back that finish it off are bawdy. All in all, it's a great second story.<br />My only whinge is that the characters, so strong and stalwart in the forst book, are not necessarily so in the second book. They express shock and horror rather more than less. I'd wish WM a bit more of the strong leader and less the whimpering maiden she sometimes comes off as in this one.<br />At any rate, this is a great second comic in a series made for adults.	2004-03-25

But it's still about three floors up from most of the other stuff on the market. And maybe it's just a longer story, and all I've read so far is the first book.<br />Promethea is a living idea, and she can posess people - but there has to be an asking for it, a looking for it.

It's absolutely graphically realistic in it's descriptions, and the story - I'm gonna give it away here - does not end happily. I read this in high school and have never forgotten it; it frightened me then and it still frightens me. The word is bleak.<br />You should still read it. You should not only read books that give you happiness, or catharsis, or what you want; those are candy for your mind and will not tell you harsh truths. You should also read books that give you gifts you don't want, gifts that make you uncomfortable or upset or frightened. Books that point out things you'd much rather you could ignore and hope they'd go away. That's why this is a classic; not because of stupendous writing or anything else (I've seen better writing).<br />I still hate this book. And I still gave it 4 stars.	2004-02-21

I read this when I was a teenager and I read it again later on, trying to figure out what exactly was supposed to be so great. Both times I was amazingly bored. With the character, with the whole plot or lack thereof, whatever. It's well written, it's a perfect portrait, but I just didn't care... sort of like the Basketball Diaries.  Again, didn't really care, and that had lots of drugs in it to make it interesting.<br />Everyone I know had a more interesting real life than these people. Maybe it's just the way it's described; if someone were really telling this story I'd be interested, but it's just so blandly written. It's like he took some great event and turned it into porridge.<br />I just don't relate ... I must be some sort of freak. Three stars because I'm afraid someone would come beat me up if I gave it less, and after all I've read worse written books.	2004-02-21

This may be an author's way of emphasizing what an extrordinarry person she is not through her own words but through the thoughts of others; if this is so then it's overkill and boggs down what it's supposed to help.<br />She's yet another adventuresome girl with military training from a rich family who has &quot;destined for great adventure&quot; written all over her, in size 72 bold font. This isn't so much a story in it's own right as it is a prelude to the story of this girl's life, off in space with her own ship to adventure.<br />Still, it's Elizabeth Moon, and I'll read the next books and follow her adventures. It's bound to get better, and I've certainly read many worse.	2004-02-20

I was expecting a bit more than this. it's very small and very thin and implies more than it says. It's sort of mocking. The sofa isn't curious in the sense that it want s to know things, it's curious in the sense that there's something different about it.<br />Definitely rated whatever you would rate your own mind, since most of the dirty stuff IS all in the implications and has little to do with the words or images. Little kids would read it and just not get it, but adults might see it a bit different.<br />Not for kids.	2003-02-11

I read some of them a while ago, and am re-reading them now (and now there are even more in the series, so there's no danger of running out any time soon!)<br />There's some moral preaching, and the series does tend to be repetitive; the people follow trends. [...]<br />(Ok, I'm off my soapbox now.)<br />That said, that's my only beef with it. The writing is lovely, the letters to and from the characters and the notes describing what happened to the letters - weather they made it or not - are wonderful.  The history comes to life and seems like a place just around the corner; you can see the mountains, touch the trees. You feel the differnt colors of the story.<br />This book represents a break from the series' tradition of plot: St Germain sets himself up in a place, meets people, gets himself a few friends and a few enemies, meets a lovely woman and sometimes an icky woman, gets into trouble and has to leave under bad circumstances. In this case, he makes a vampire out of a woman... and ooooh boy was that a mistake. It's sort of three related novelettes, taking place over some time. It isn't resolved completely at the end, thus the title of this review: I smell a sequel....<br />I actually like this book all the more for it's breaking from the traditional plot of her others. It's nice to know that while history may repeat itself, Chelsea Quin Yarbro doesn't have to.	2003-02-11

This second book is as real as the first, and very cool. I like the fact that alchoholism and addiction are dealt with realisticly, and prostitution isn't given the warm and fuzzy treatment... so many people seem to think it's cool or something these days. And unlike some characters who've never done a bad thing in their lives, Munch has reason to be in cruddy situations. But she's trying, and working hard at it.<br />So basicaly the same good stuff as the first, only a bit further along in the story.	2003-02-11

Take a fantasy world and bump it into the present time...<br />Well, I usualy like Diane Duane's stuff, but this one just seemed a bit too typical of the fantasy genre. It's a good fantasy book, but nothing really elevates it form the common crowd. The way her young wizard series is written is much better.	2003-02-11

I started out a bit confused, because they're not written like anything I'd ever read before (and I've read an awful lot). But once you catch on to the language, once you start seeing the things she's describing with so much delight and understanding, you can't stop.<br />These books are amazing.... full of color and poetry, joy and movement and magic (good and bad). There's a lot of life in these books. They make the world a fun place to be again.<br />It really doesn't matter how old you are when you read them, they're like peaches and blueberries: you love 'em as a kid, you love 'em as a teen, you'll be putting 'em in a blender and still eating 'em mushy when you have no teeth left (or maybe getting the large print version is a better example, but you know what I mean.) And can you imagine never having tasted a peach, and trying a really ripe, sweet one for the first time as an adult? That's what these books are like.	2002-10-27

But it leaves a couple... ok, more than a couple, the whole book is a loose end, a teaser for a sequel... which just so happens to be \\"dark magic\\" byt the same author. Oh, well.<br />Other than that, it's a werewolf book, describing the changes in a girl's life and outlook when she first changes into a wolf during puberty. It's almost but not quite a standard monster book, almost but not quite a cliche. it's ok, I guess.. I've read a lot better, and some worse. It just doesn't evoke a sense of excitement... probably because it's so short.<br />It feels like there should be more going on, more description or something. It reads like one of those little first-chapters of new books you get at the end of other books, to try and get you to buy them.<br />Still, it's a decent story. If you're willing to shell out for both books, you should probably save time and buy them both at once.	2002-10-27
US	48232267	R37D1521U0LV85	0679781293	222744857	Flood	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Darkly funny	This is the first in the Burke series. I read the second (didn't even know they were a series at the time) when I was a teen... you really don't need the first to read the second... Anyways, I read it, and thought \\"yes\\". Burke is a con artist, an ocasional murderer, a paranoid (but they're really after him) and a theif. He lives on the edges of the gene pool, where the scum grows thick and green. He also, incedentaly, hates loaths and despises child molesters and abusers in general. Voilla, a story is born. Flood, as the first book, is also the first of several tough sexy women, all physically different but all sharing similar charactistcs (Vachss doesn't deal in innocence much, unless it's in how it was taken away).<br />Andrew Vachss became somewhat of a target of controversy for writing these books; some people say he's capitalizing on child abuse, others think he should be sainted for drawing such unflattering attention to it & campaigning against it. Personaly, I give less than a smidge for the politics of my authors; if I had to research the backgrounds of everyone who writes the books I read I'd never bother to read. I generaly just judge a book on how it was written. And I really, really like these books. They crack me up (ok, so some people seem to think they're morbid and cynical. So?) and [annoys me]at the same time.<br />If there's one thing about this series that gets to me it's a sameness about the women as Vachss writes them. Not a physical sameness... he's good about that. And as characters, they stand out vividly in mind. But... while Vachss characterizes his main people extremely well (I love Michelle and the Mole) he doesn't give as much depth to the ones who arn't sticking around. They tell their stories and step offstage.<br />The stories get more complex later in the series, and better, which is why this one - as simple, prefect and sweet as it is - gets only 4 stars. I'd call it 4.5, but there's no catagory for half stars.<br />People with a low threshhold for the really grim stuff in life should read these in moderation.a low threshhold for the really grim stuff in life should read these in moderation.	2002-10-27
US	48232267	R1ZXY2CLUSYWHF	096782219X	803306170	Perfect Trust: A Rowan Gant Investigation	Books	4	8	11	N	Y	Read the first 2 before this one	The editing hasn't gotten any better than it was in the first 2, the writing is a bit better but still clumsy, and the author still has a tendency to preach. That said, I still like it, rather a lot.<br />It's the most realistic portrayal of Wicca I've seen yet. I get the feeling he's sort of writing a character loosely based on himself and his own wife. It makes a real change from the other stuff out there, and while I mentioned the editing and stuff, all that's not really a flaw. The only thing I really consider a flaw is the lack of a sense of humor in the books. Yes, grim situation and all, but humor is still a good thing.<br />For the fantastic element, I'd recommend ..  in adition to these... the Weetzie Bat books, which have a terrific sense of humor, and are generaly less grim.<br />But if you like grim, I'd say go with Andrew Vachss, who does grim better than anyone, only with funny bits too.<br />Remember: your mind is like soup. What ingredients you put in affect the flavor of the whole thing.	2002-10-27

Good writing, even if the series does get a bit repetitive after a while. This is the first book, though, and it's quite fresh.<br />The main character, Anita, is a necromancer who has a sideline hobby of hunting vampires. She starts out very black and white: people good, vampires bad. This book begins her slide toward a world populated with a few more colors: shades of grey, and quite a bit of red. Although, granted, even her shades of grey are a bit more black-and-white than real life... but hey, the books are really good fun.	2002-10-17

Anita \\"just says no\\" to human sacrifice, but not everyone has her scruples. This second book in the series carries on in the same vein as the first, continuing her slide toward what she considers \\"moral ambiguity\\" and we call \\"steamy love scenes\\". Plus the title is just plain cool.	2002-10-17

After all, it's not Miles Vorkosigan... but then I read it, and my doubts are gone. I wouldn't go so far as to say I'd read a grocery list if Lois wrote it... but it would be a close thing.<br />I love this book, I'm very glad I bought it, and I'll probably read it again someday. Once again we have a character who prevails not because of his mighty thews and sweaty bulging muscles, or any tremendous inate ability for sparkly magic. Oh, drat, I won't say anymore. You'll just have to read it yourself.<br />And I have to hope there's more stuff taking place in Chalion sometime in the future... not necessarily a sequil, but something in the same world.	2002-09-17

For those of us who lived through them, this will seem extremely funny. For those whose memories start a bit later, or who were rather young at the time, this will be an interesting anthropological study. Except for the occasioanl cartoon that made me laugh out loud, bring the book to work and photocopy a page, clip the cartoon out and post it by a computer, and point it out obsessively to everyone else in the office.<br />Wiley is one of my favorite cartoonists, and I love his stuff... but maybe more his later stuff than this earlier stuff. He has a website, and you can read his current cartoons online (back to 2000). He even does buisness cards. I want the ones where you can have your name &amp; info next to a picture of the penguin hovering near a flower. Unfortunately, his website stuff doesn't ship overseas... Guess I have to wait.	2002-09-04

I was trying to finish a paragraph... and I couldn't, because I was laughing so hard that every time I finished the first sentence of the paragraph I would start crying and fall off the couch. This woke up my husband, who came and stood staring blearily from the doorway at me then went back to bed (and closed the door very hard).<br />After about 5 minuites of this, I had to blow my nose and wipe my eyes, and I finaly finished the paragraph.

Book 3 of the series.<br />Well, I was hoping for something as quirky and smoothly written as the first two books. It was good, and it is an ending to a series I enjoyed, but it's not as good as the begining.
