Ms. Steinbach could do more if she put down the humorous internal conversations that I know she had while traveling abroad...she just didn't write them down.  If you are looking for a good coffee-house book to read DON'T pick this one....pick GOOD IN BED, any of BILL BRYSON'S books....or anything else that you thought you would wait to read!!	2003-05-11

Although I am focusing on the Upper/Lower Kern River...the book provides specifics of different water-craft running sections of rivers, logistics, and most importantly...details on the section run.  It outlines most of the major rapids and what to look for (keepers, boulders, other fun objects).  However, it does NOT subsititue for scouting the rapids!!  Additionally, although I truly love the format, detailed information, and humerous descriptions of trips, some rapids are left out and are not even shown on the maps...so know the rivers in addition to reading this great resource!	2001-06-07
