I loved it until it hurt, since it tells a lot of truths about the tragedy America is being subjected to by rightwingers. I get a lot of uninvited books sent to me. I give them a few pages and if they don't grab me, they're toast. This one grabbed me like the DaVinci Code did, and I had to finish it.<br /><br />If you liked The Librarian, or Jonathan Safran Foer's Everything Illuminated, there's a good chance you'll like this tongue in cheek political adventure.<br /><br />The subtle ending took me by surprise, but after a little thought, it was very realistic.	2005-10-13

I first wrote a review of this book having read about 70 pages. You can see my review below. It was pretty negative. But my wife loved the book, so I kept plodding along. Lo and behold, by the time I went another ten pages into the book, it picked up and started pulling together. The rest of book was a fast read and it really got me thinking. This book talks about clones, but it could just as easily be discussing any person's life. Thoreau's line about people living lives of quiet desperation really came to mind. Unfortunately, the edit function for amazon reviews will not allow me to change my star rating. Otherwise, I'd give it a four.<br /><br /> While so many of the reviewers here loved this book, as did my other half, I read 70+ pages into it and it never hooked me. It may purport to be science fiction, but it's more like speculative fiction, at best.  I'm a long-time science fiction fan, read a ton of non-fiction and have read from cover to cover some books that most people give up on, like Foucault's Pendulum. But not this one. There is some nice nuance in creating the kinds of mind games kids play. But for me, I have too big a pile of other books calling me to keep on going when the book never goes anywhere. So, for me, this book was a waste of time. Recent books I've really enjoyed, in addtion to books I've reviewed, include Bookseller of Kabul, Kiterunner,  Dan Brown's books, Dave Zirin's What's My Name Fool, Bret Stephensons Slaying the Dragon... to name a few.	2005-09-12

Thom's Newest book, We The People: A Call To Take Back America,\\" is simply must reading. It's not quite describable, but a cross between animated comic and Japanese anime art, but it's talking about all the political and democracy issues that Thom takes on so well-- corporate personhood, the right wing threat to democracy, selling off the commons, how the founders, particularly Jefferson, of America would have viewed today's situations....<br /><br />I've reprinted just about every article Thom publishes lately, on my progressive. tough liberal website OpEdNews dot com, where I am editor publisher. His articles are always among the most popular. (They are usually first published on CommonDreams dot org.) If you know Thom's work, whether his brilliant books, Last Hours or Unequal Protection, or his OpEd articles, you'll want to be sure to get this newest book. You'll be very glad you did. If you're smart, you'll order two or three, since you're definitely going to want to pass them out to people you care about.<br /><br />I don't think anyone discusses democracy, not any pundit or politician alive, than Thom Hartmann. He approaches his subject matters with vision, depth of history, compassion and intelligence. He says he comes from the \\"radical middle\\" and it's true. his positions are ones the average person agrees with-- filled with common sense and great wisdom.<br /><br />You'll want to hide this book from your right wing relatives... just getting a look at it will be like a punch in the face, or... a flush of blood to the brain. But you'll want to get lots of copies to give to your friends. I'm getting a copy for each of my kids (23, 20 and 14.)<br /><br />Frankly, when I heard that some of Thom's writing had been adapted to a comic format, I was skeptical. But it's been brilliantly done. The originally ideas that were in Thom's essays are actually improved upon by the creative imagination of his editors and illustrator-- Gene Latimer (Editor), Paul Burke (Editor), Neil Cohn (Illustrator.)<br /><br />Don't think of this is a comic book. Think of it as a hyper-idea media document that will rivet your attention and move you to passion. This is a powerful book that will make a difference.<br /><br />I know at least one person who has started a We The People Campaign, inspired by this book.gination of his editors and illustrator-- Gene Latimer (Editor), Paul Burke (Editor), Neil Cohn (Illustrator.)<br /><br />Don't think of this is a comic book.

It's because she is speaking as a mother. This book is an inspiring strategy book, a historic compendium of how women have used the feminine archetype and women's ways to heal society, to rescue cultures from world. Consider as powerful and profound and take it to heart.<br /><br />Jean Shinoda Bolen is dead on right when she says that we need to gather the women to save the world, I'm a guy, and I'm certain that it is male or masculine energy that is screwing things up here.<br /><br />Bolen presents, in many different ways, examples, evidence and proof of how women do things differently and how that different approach is desperately needed now. It's not that men can't do what is needed. Men CAN do it too, but they have to embrace the approaches that women use, the reactions and strategies that women use to react to stress, to trouble, to war, because the way women responds is more nurturing, more healing, more likely to build community rather than competition, more likely to create synergy.<br /><br />I discovered this book because I came to the conclusion that the right wing in the USA and fundamentalists throughout the world are engaged in a huge backlash and war against both women, women's right and the feminine archetype. I concluded that their reaction is a last dying paroxysm of resistance to a trend that is inevitable-that women regain the rights and privileges they had thousands of years ago, before agriculture and the hierarchical culture and slavery it produced appeared-when goddesses and priestesses were common and when women shared in leading society.<br /><br />Having also studied George Lakoff's books, including Don't Think of An Elephant, Moral Politics and Metaphors We Live By (which I read in the 1980's) I concluded that Lakoff's model, which has led to him becoming a \\"framing\\" guru for Democratic leaders, could benefit by adding a mythic, feminine archetype perspective. When he talks about nurturing parent and strict parent cultures and families, he could also be talking about masculine archetype and feminine archetype families and cultures.<br /><br />Jean Shinoda Bolen's new book provides a conceptualization of ways to think about language, interventions, cultural phenomena, and change strategies that have the potential to be just as powerful as Lakoffs. She's not talking about framing, but she is offering a different way to approach the same problems. Any reader of Lakoff's Don't Think of An Elephant should find this book rewarding, empowering, enlightening and energizing, with a plethora of ideas of how to take action and go the next step to make a difference.<br /><br />This is a book every woman who cares about politics and change should read and every man who can handle dealing with embracing the feminine will love.aphors We Live By (which I read in the 1980's) I concluded that Lakoff's model, which has led to him becoming a \\"framing\\" guru for Democratic leaders, could benefit by adding a mythic, feminine archetype perspective.

The author takes the basic protocols used by the majority of the field and then integrates qEEG, one of the fastest growing approaches to neurofeedback. Another reviewer calls qEEG \\"outdated.\\"  This is an outrageous, misleading statement, at best. qEEG IS controversial and not all practitioners use it. My own opinion on qEEG is that it is very often useful and sometimes essential, partifcularly for traumatic brain injury, as the book states, but not always necessary. I also believe that non-qEEG approaches can be very effective. But suggesting that qEEG outdated is, just plain wrong.<br /><br />This book provides a wide range of different perspectives  at a very affordable price, offering the entry level and novice practitioner of neurofeedback a wealth of state of the art information. Any practitioner getting started with neurofeedback would be advised to invest in this book.

Inner Drives is an important, valuable new approach that enables writers to approach plot and characters from a new perspective that just happens to be built upon models that are thousands of years old.<br /><br />The book uses the term Inner drives to describe what I think of as the Chakra energy system, but there are many terms that have been used to describe the different levels of energy, of consciousness that range from the most basic physical through to the most mystical and transcendant.<br /><br />Pamela takes you through the different levels and helps you to see how you can use changes in them to reflect changes in your characters. This is the real deal, the stuff that myths, heroes, and the most powerful stories are made of.<br /><br />As organizer of the Storycon Summit Meeting on the Art, Science and Application of Story, it's my job to know the leaders in the world of story. Pamela is a rock solid expert whose extraordinary breadth of knowledge is only exceeded by her vision. Inner Drives is a gift that weaves together her knowledge and vision. If you liked Chris Vogler's Writer's Journey and/or James Bonnet's Stealing Fire From the Gods, then you'll surely want to order this book right away.

They've invested hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in think tanks that devise strategies for pitching policies, for wrapping policies in words and language. They literally have a play book on how to frame the issues-- the words and phrases to use and not use.<br /><br />George Lakoff shines light on the way that language is used by the republicans and right wingers and then goes further, explaining the ways people think-- the images and language they use in their heads. Then he explains how to take back the language, the words and the dialogue.<br /><br />If you haven't read his work-- either this book or his longer, more academic one, Moral Politics, then you will probably routinely fall into the trap of using language and words that the right wing has loaded with framing, spin and meaning that already has you at a disadvantage by just uttering those words.<br /><br />Once you've read the book, you'll understand the buzzwords and phrases that the right wing routinely uses in their speeches and talking points. I can't imagine attempting to understand today's politics without digesting a serious dose of Lakoff.	2004-11-19

Yet over and over again, I felt my heart touched, and on a few occassions, tears welling in my eyes. Thom Hartmann has, by a strange accident of fate, become an extraordinary Jefferson scholar. When you combine the visionary mind of Rennaisance man Thom Hartmann with the revolutionary genius of an earlier Tom-- Thomas Jefferson, you get a book that wakes you up and gets you thinking about what you can do, what the nation and the world need to do to stop the founders of America from turning in their graves and stop the nation's turn toward decreased rights, liberties and freedom.<br /><br />If you read political books, this is one you don't want to miss. Hartmann may not be as recognizable a name as some, but his ideas stand at least as tall, with the added strength of a unique vision that spans the centuries past and the centuries to come. This is a book that will become a classic people will read 50, even 100 years from now.<br /><br />Hartmann is also one of the smartest, most informed talk show hosts in America today. He's been ranked among the top 100 in the business. His show can be called liberal, progressive, yet it is civil without nastiness. He says it is aimed at the radical middle.	2004-09-25

It's a novel written by a first class novelist who has clearly put a lot of time into researching how things work in D.C., in the white house, the media, the senate...  This is my second Patterson book and frankly, I'm going to keep tearing through his ouvre.<br /><br />The book explores the machinations of a fictious group that's a lot like the NRA, with creepy characters who resemble some from real life.<br /><br />The character development in the story is excellent. The detail that describes the workings of the legislative process and all the influences involved is incredible. Patterson brings characters to life and gets you caring about them. He even includes a bit of a love story.<br /><br />But mostly, this book tells a riveting, stay up half the night to keep reading story that totally revolves around an honest president who refuses to sell out to corporate or special interests.

It is not uncommon, that you will find a subject area which has several pages of fine print quotations dedicated to it, in comparison to a handful of quotes that are found in the average collection.<br />If you consider the book, based on the cost per quotation, it's actually a very good deal.<br />Because it is so comprehensive, some of the quotes are classics, some are highly familiar, but to me, the gems are the unusual ones, all with excellent source information. It's amazing that such a vast compendium does such a good job, and that it was done before the age of computers. (First ed was in the 30's.)<br />If you want the biggest and best, this is it, whether it goes by the Macmillan name or the Home book of Quotations name.

You won't want to put it down.<br />Steve Barnes is quite an extraordinary writer having co-authored best-selling science fiction with top-seller Larry Niven, and having written episodes of Outer Limits, Star Trek and Baywatch. Baywatch? Yes, he's blended all these different genres together here, in this book to provide a superb read.<br />This is a very smart book that does a great job including touchstones from contemporary life-- little details that we all live, experience and touch. They make it more real, more immediate, so we connect better with the characters, the scenes where the action unfolds.<br />It's hard to define the genre, but I'd compare it to James Patterson's Where the Wind Blows, which also used a plot about an experiment to build better children, gone awry. Call it mainstream fantasy with a slightly science fictional touch.<br /><br />There are five or six different interwoven story threads that Steve Barnes does a beautiful job tying up neatly by the books suspenseful end. Each one develops characters we get to know and love or hate.<br />I had a chance to meet Steve Barnes recently. He is an amazing bundle of positive energy. This shines through in the writing. He's a disciplined, passionate writer, martial arts black belt, loving father and principled good guy. Yes. He made a good impression on me. There's a lot of character and integrity that shines through in the book, plus just enough sexuality to make it an adult book.<br />What blows my mind is the premise for the scifi aspect of the story-- that you can record  behavior patterns and train others to reproduce the patterns of special people--  fits very nicely with some research I presented in 1981, using ski biofeedback to train beginners to move like experts. My model back then theorized that \\"template athletic biofeedback\\" could be used to teach average people to perform like great experts.

The \\"thing\\" is the big corporation, which 116 years ago was granted personhood by what seems to me to have been malicious error on the part of the supreme court of the US. Thom Hartmann tells an extraordinary story, starting with the colonial era, about how big business has caused havoc and suffering among humanity. For example, the Boston Tea Part was aimed at a megacorporation, not the British Government.<br />The book tells how human rights, created for humans, have been stolen by corporations and used to corrupt the government created of by and for the people. Corporate personhood is the prime weapon they wield to manipulate laws that should be protecting real people.<br />In Jurassic Park, the cloned dinosaurs got out of control when a \\"theoretical\\" lock on their breeding failed. Humanity lost control of corporations when a former Railroad company president took a job as a court reporter for the Supreme Court. He added a note on a case that said that corporations were persons and entitled to rights under the 14th amendment. The truth is that the justices of the court explicitly avoided a ruling on that issue. Since then, cases have been based on that \\"plant\\" court reporter's sabotage of the Justices actual ruling.<br />He wrote the book before the Enron and Tyco and Worldcom horrors reached the news, but the book does an amazing job of explaining how these were possible. Most important, the book is a call to action with solutions. Bush doesn't have the answers, Greenspan has cute terms, but no answers. Hartmann's book is a powerful read about a monster behemoth invented by man. Yes, it is a horror story that is true. But at least it opens up the door to discussion about how corporations can cause the massive levels of death, enslavement, human suffering and ecological disaster that is going on right now.<br />Hartmann actually includes model legislative verbiage that can be used at the state level to reign in out-of-control corporations. For this alone, the book is worth the investment. But, like Thom's other books, Prophet's Way, and Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight, the book is written so it rivets your attention in a page-turning way. if you are passionate about making the world a better place, this book will whet your passion, and give you some focus and concrete strategies for doing something to make a difference.Enron and Tyco and Worldcom horrors reached the news, but the book does an amazing job of explaining how these were possible.

Get it and your life and attitude will change dramatically.<br />Thom Hartmann, one of the world's most respected experts on ADD, proposes a different perspective -- that people with ADD are like hunters in a farmers' world. The beauty of this idea is it sees ADDers as different, not neurologically  defective.<br />It's been said that it takes an ADD person to be an entrepreneur. &quot;Hunters&quot; are also great at sales, a creative work, at programming, at detective work. They're all aspects of the business world that benefit from the hunter personality.<br />This book helps you learn put your best face forward, so you function at your best, and it helps you learn how to compensate for the lack of farmer traits.	2002-08-10

Why? Because he doesn't label people with ADD as having brain disease and broken. His Hunter in a Farmer's World Model makes so much sense. It's been dissed by Barkley and others, but in the last year hard genetic research has come in proving the theory, and other ADD researchers have reached the same conclusions.<br />But that's not why you should buy this book Buy it because it gives tons of examples of people with ADD who have had success in all different aspects of life. The fact is, ADD people are the ones with ants in their pants who change the world. Who don't sit there and settle for the ordinary. They do things-- start companies (entrepreneurs,) make noise about problems (call them politicians and activists,) investigate stuff (detectives, reporters, scientists who don't wash test tubes and replicate the ADD scientists visionary work.)<br />So read about how ADD'ers make it, how they succeed, and start feeling not only hopeful, but perhaps even a bit cocky about being an ADD'er or knowing one.	2002-06-16

But this book is even better than I expected, in terms of the breadth and depth it covers. It covers mood, energy, relaxation, entheogens, memory, stress busters--- and a lot more.<br />Knowing Dr. Cass's  past books on herbal approaches, I expected a primarily herbal approach to natural highs. But this book covers all kinds of natural means to get high, to feel good more,  including color therapies, biofeedback, aromatherapy, massage, meditation and much more. The list of resources and sources in the back of the book is probably worth the price alone.<br />This book gives a ton of great ways to get high naturally without drugs. I'm particularly interested in the supplements for sharpening the mind and will be trying some of them.<br />Lastly, the book calls for a kind of integrated approach to positive states, taking an enlightened, positive psychology approach. The book also discusses how to get off of addictive drugs. Put it all together and this book is good news.	2002-06-06

That says a lot. I am not usually a big fan of spy novels. This may be the first I've ever read, and it was great. With the movie coming to theaters soon, I thought I'd get a head start on the story. It was great!! One of the rules of good story writing is for the protagonist to know what his go al is, what's driving him to the climax of the story. In this case, the protagonist starts off not only now knowing what he wants, he doesn't know who he is. And we, the readers gradually learn, along with him, not only who he is, but also what he needs to do. This is an artfully crafted novel which you won't want to put down. Needless to say, I'll be reading more Robert Ludlum.	2002-06-06

About 24 years ago, I sold my first freelance article to a national magazine. It was directly due to Writer's Market-- due to the solid nuts and bolts information you get, updated each year.<br />The book lists thousands of magazines, publishers and agents and the key info you need to intelligently contact them. You get chapter/articles which advise you on how to research a publisher before making contact, and then, how to submit your writing queries. Then, it lists thousands of magazines, categorizing them by demographics, subject matter, regions, etc. They give you the pay rates, lengths of the articles or stories, they seek, topics they are extra interested in, who to contact, how to get a sample copy and writer's guidelines. They tell you whether the publication accepts simultaneous submissions or e-mail proposals, and if they want S.A.S.E.s And if you don't understand all those terms, they provide a glossary of writer's terminology.<br />Since I started buying Writer's Market, (and the monthly magazine also published by the same company, Writer's Digest) I have had articles published in Success, OMNI (10 articles in OMNI alone) Family Health, and cover articles in Writer's Digest (on coming up with article ideas) and the National Enquirer (on arthritis pain relief and on vitamins)<br />Since I write on topics that grab my interest, it's important that I have a fast way to access info which publications cover which topics. This book does the job.<br />The publishing world changes so fast you need to keep up with current information. This is one book that you should not save your pennies on by buying an older used edition of an earlier year.<br />A common sob story of the writing business is you start with an editor who loves your work, only to submit your finished assignment to a new editor who has replaced the editor you signed on with.

We all need to think about the world, about life, work, God, happiness-- all the topics good quotation books explore-- from the perspective of the people of color.<br />Dorothy Winbush Riley, an elementary school principal and former teacher first put her quote collection together for students.  She did a great job which deserved the American Library Association Best Reference Book Award.<br />Keep this one in mind if you are writing or speaking about social change.	2002-01-08

Edited by a German team of leading Neuroscientists-- Thomas Elbert Birgitte Rosckstroh, Werner Lutzenberger and Niels Birbaumer, the book provides an exciting picture of the state of the art of neuroregulation back in the early eighties, discussing cutting edge applications which have yet to be realized.<br />It offers a number of chapters covering the slow brain potential feedback work that Birbaumer has been working on since at least the mid seventies (doing some of that work with M. Barry Sterman.) This slow potential work has more recently been reported in Time, Newsweek and other media for it's exciting approach to A.L.S. (Lou Gherig's Disease)<br />It also offers several chapters on operant conditioning and control of event related and slow potentials, with a section on Evoked potential self regulation.<br />Chapter contributors recognizable to biofeedback practitioners include Sterman, Lubar, Kamiya, Rosenfeld, Birbaumer, Lang, and for old timers, Mulholland and Dworkin, as well as a number of apparently European contributors.<br />This is no easy read, and it is not a cookbook, but it is certainly one worth searching for if you are a serious researcher or practitioner. Good luck finding it though. My attempt to find a used copy on the web this evening proved fruitless (and I'm pretty good at those kinds of searches.) I hope you don't have to go to Siberia to find yours. &lt;g&gt;<br />At first, I thought this might be the first text on neurofeedback, but one of the contributors to this book, Peter Rosenfeld corrected me. According to him, the earliest book on the subject was: &quot;Operant Control of Brain Activity&quot;  edited by Michael Chase in 1974, published by the Brain Information Service/Brain Research Institute of UCLA.ted by Michael Chase in 1974, published by the Brain Information Service/Brain Research Institute of UCLA.	2001-12-16

There are very few people who have followed his path. It is no wonder that he has such an amazing group of people (Albert Hoffman, Ken Wilber, Stephen Larsen) contributing to his book.<br />This is not your typical beautiful art book. It will fill you up, as many an art book can, but it will also lift you, and offer you a kaleidoscope of visions, or more precisely, ways of looking at the world.<br />the book also includes some images of Alex's dream project, the creation of a sacred space where his sacred mirrors series can be properly displayed. I have a feeling that when it completed, it will evoke feelings similar to those one experiences when entering Notre Dame, the Blue Mosque, (been to them)  or the Pyramids.	2001-12-12

Just about every other book ever published on biofeedback has a clinical, reductionist medical approach (except for Elmer Green''s books, Beyond Biofeedback and Ozawkie Book of The Dead.) Anna Wise, a regular trainer at Esalen,  takes a more holistic approach based on her 25+ years of experience observing the brain wave patterns of people with awakened mind-- yogis, top executives, artists, etc.<br />Rather than talking about treating illness, she talks about optimizing brain function and mental states, about enhancing the contents and quality of consciousness.<br />She discusses how she uses the Mind Mirror, a technology originally developed by her Mentor Max Cade and engineer Geoff Blundell, to assess how our brains are operating and then, she devises strategies to get our brains working more like a person with an awakened mind.<br />She offers exercises and a strategies which help you learn to put your brain in better places.<br />If you want to see the whole picture of the biofeedback world, Anna is definitely not a part of the medical pathology mainstream and that's the way she likes it.<br />When she is a speaker at the EEG biofeedback conference I run, she speaks a different language, which addresses spirit and the whole person. There have been  some  academic researchers who were really turned off by her, at first. But after discussing her approach, in detail and not just reacting to her &quot;soft&quot; approach to brain technology, many have turned around, and found common ground with her.<br />Jim Robbins book, Symphony in the brain, is a good history of the more recent developments in higher frequency brain biofeedback, mostly focused on treatment. Evan's and Abarbanel's Quantitative EEG and EEG Biofeedback is a strictly professional text, with about 15 contributed chapters. Anna Wise's contribution to the writing on brain biofeedback provides a very nice feminine ying to the masculine yang that has predominated in the field.yang that has predominated in the field.	2001-12-05

Don't buy first	It's rare that I give low ratings to a book. But in this case, I feel the need to forwarn potential readers. <br />Having a kid with ADHD can be very trying, can drive you crazy and or make you cry. But these kids very often have real strengths too, and their differences make them special. <br />There are so many really good books on ADHD that the liabilities of this book make it silly to waste your money on this over-pathologizing book which casts such a dark picture. <BR>Barkley's approach to ADHD sinks it's fangs into hope and sucks it dry, leaving you with the idea that ADHD is a brain disease or disorder that is permanently damaging, with no redeeming qualities. <br />There are so many kids with ADHD who are bright and gifted, so full of energy that they grow up to be highly successful. Different--- but successful. I suggest that you first check out Thom Hartmann's Complete Book on ADD ADHD, Ned Hallowell's and John Ratey's DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION, William Sears and Lynda Thompson's THE ADD BOOK, and books by Lynn Weiss. These have more balanced, hopeful approaches to ADD/ADHD. <br />This is my interpretation, but it seems to me that Barkley, who has done considerable consulting for drug companies (including paid lectures) leans WAY too much towards the use of drugs to treat ADHD. And he has repeatedly attacked a research-supported non-drug approach-- neurofeedback, also called EEG biofeedback-- which teaches clients to balance their brainwaves, decreasing brainwaves associated with distractability, increasing brainwaves related to attention and calm, stillness (See Jim Robbins' Symphony in the Brain.) <br />While this book does offer some useful tips on behavioral interventions, I must caution you to read it after you've read at least one of the above books, or you are at risk of developing a depressingly bleak approach toward ADD. <br />I've met so many successful adult ADDers who consider ADD a blessing. It is a shame that Barkley casts his shadowy point of view on so many parents, children and adults with ADD.	2001-11-29

I am brutal with books, physically. I read them while walking /running on the treadmill, so I sweat on them. But only the most riveting books keep my attention during my workout. I may literally bring 5 books and the NY Times to read during a 40 minute workout. But only one gets read. This book was sweat on a LOT. I think I worked out a bit more often while in the process of reading it. I wish it had been longer. The other thing I do is mark books up. I put one line or star next to an idea I like, two next to a really good idea and three next to one I'd like to re-read and even type into my quotation database.  This poor book has been sweat on and marked up more than most I've read in the last years, getting sweat and three line/star rankings comparable with McKee, Seger and Bonnet.<br />But this one is different. While the other books on writing have been about structure and story elements, this book is more about the soul of writing. And we need both. Structure provides the bones upon which we add the flesh which we dig up from our souls.<br />Sweet differentiates between stories which are written from the soul versus genre-escapist stuff. Like Carol Bly (Beyond the Writing Workshop) he says you need to get out of your self when writing so you can tap your deepest aspects of your soul.<br />He says, &quot;Shamans are those who dare to confront the invisible and hidden world of their own psyches. By way of this inner adventure they struggle towards an understanding and therefore an acceptance of the contradictory needs and fears that split all persons. Healing or an increased accord is the attempt's reward; directly for the shaman who has labored, indirectly for those who identify with the work that results from this labor. ..... The writer, when functioning as a shaman, pursues both societal and personal fidelity. ..... As a messenger of necessary yet disturbing information, the shaman is often dismissed as an irritant or even scapegoated, that is to say, sacrificed or blamed for the mistakes and crimes of others.&quot;<br />Burdette Sweet helps you go deep. to the truth, the hard to reach places where the best dimensions of story live.

Second-- 659 reviews as a write this. But I'll bet not many are guys. I saw an ad that looked good in the NY Times, saw a pile in front of the cash register desk at Walden (of the 5th in the series) so I figured, having always enjoyed time travel stories, that I'd take this one for a ride. It's a tale about a nurse, who, just after world war two has ended, while visiting Scottland for a second honeymoon, walks into some magic which whisks her back to the mid 1700s in the highlands.<br />First surprise, when I asked for the first in the series-- it's in the romance section. Okay, so I'm an open-minded, somewhat androgynous guy. I can handle this. It's not as bad as asking for directions or carrying my significant other's purse (when we are taking a hike where I got to choose the path.)<br />I figured this might be a bit like Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.  That was maybe 20% right. But, being a science fiction fan, I expected to see loads of examples of how she brings 20th century to the loch and the castle. Not happening. While not what I expected, it's a great period piece which makes you feel you are looking through this woman's eyes and really seeing the pre-colonial era.<br />For me, it got kind of weird when the love-making is given graphic description. My other half asked me if it turned me on. &quot;It's from a woman's point of view!&quot; I exclaimed. So it was not a turn on, but it was interesting. These are two highly sexed main characters. The bad guy in the story has an interesting twist.<br />The last long novel like this I read was Anne Rice's The Witching Hour. Like that book, this one has a series of sequels to enjoy. I am looking forward to the next part of the story.	2001-11-17

It's spiritual message has me determined to persuade my kids to read it. My oldest has already agreed.<br />Spiritual Secret is a precious gift. Thom Hartmann says, &quot;Nothing has meaning, save the meaning you give it. What you call your culture is nothing but the stories you all decide to agree are true, whether or not they are.&quot;<br />So Thom has created a story which helps our culture. He creates new meaning with a clear vision-- one based on what Jesus and Moses and Buddha and Mohammed taught, rather than the institutional religious teachings which, over time, became distorted and twisted by greed, ego and the desire for power.<br />This story offers us us a new story to embrace as our spiritual reality, one closer to the bone, with truths which, though always available to us, shout out through his words, with clarity and soul.<br />While it has many incredibly inportant messages, it reads like a cross between an action thriller and one of Daniel Quinn's idea adventures, like Ishmael.<br />Beware.

That was a great book. This one, updated and improved is even better. It is a comprehensive approach, with plenty of research back-up, to meditation. It is excellent for both the consumer who wants to learn to meditate and the health care provider who wants to introduce meditation into his or her practice. It is a great book to prescribe for clients.<br />Dr. Carrington, who I've known for about six years now, is one of the most thorough professionals I know. This book does a great job covering the bases, not just how to but also what to do when you encounter the twists and turns on the path of meditation, and it is a path.<br />I've also always liked that this book avoids inclusion of religious considerations. It is characterized as Clinically Standardized Meditation to make clear that it is not yoga or Zen meditation, or any other religion's form, though it is informed of the core elements which make these work.<br />I guess you can look on this non-religious aspect of this book as either a strength or a weakness. If you want to learn to meditate, without the excess baggage of a spiritual component, this is the book for you. If you want to learn to meditate and then integrate meditation into your faith, this can work nicely too. But if you want to learn to meditate using an approach that includes a spiritual path as well, then there are other books which will better suit you-- on TM, by Lama Surya Das and others.	2001-10-18

Then he regales us with a wonderful story about his expedition into the deepest dessert areas of the Kalahari to find the last living indigenous Bushmen. There is magic in this book, in the panoramic, images he paints of nature scenes and spiritual moments of insight and mystic wonder. Part of the goal of the expedition was to create a documentary for BBC. I'd love to find a copy of that to view. The mixture of the gritty reality of mounting and carrying out a real safari expedition, blended with the wonder and surprise the author shares makes this a very special book. We have so much to learn from history's lost indigenous cultures. Books like these help remind us of the different, incredible ways one can be human.

It was their work and vision which attracted me to the field almost thirty years ago-- their transpersonal approach to biofeedback as a tool which can help one achieve not only relief from symptoms, but perhaps most important, higher consciousness, awareness and personal growth. The Greens traveled to India and studied the psychophysiology of yogis, and they set up Psychophysiology program at the Menninger foundation, where they along with Patricia Norris, Steve Fahrion, Dale Walters, Joe Sargent and others blazed the trail that led to the establishment of the field of biofeedback.<br />This book goes beyond looking at biofeedback as a treatment and enters the realm of wisdom, consciousness and spirituality. For example, Elmer believes that EEG theta training at OZ is a former of \\"instrumental Vipassana\\" which enables the trainee to access planetary consciousness.<br />Elmer and Alyce Green were highly involved in starting a number of visionary organizations which have made their mark on this planet. These include:<br />Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (aapb.org) International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine (ISSSEEM) Association of Transpersonal Psychology<br />Elmer has a new book out titled The Ozawkie Book of the Dead.

One becomes truly a man  only by conforming to the teaching of the myths, that is, by imitating the gods.&quot;<br />What has stuck with me is how he's described the way that primitive man would seek out and find the sacred. For example, finding and creating sacred space and the threshold between the sacred and profane space.<br />If you like this, also consider Joseph Campbell's writings, as well as John Huston's.	2001-08-17

If a drug, the FDA would rate this book Class 3	If this book was a drug the FDA would make it Class 3. It is that powerful and will have that strong an effect on your life.<br />While it is described as an account of a Malaysia tribe, it is, more importantly, a window into another way of thinking about WHAT IT IS TO BE HUMAN. That is also the name the book was originally given by it's author. Robert Wolff opens our eyes to see and think about possibilities for being human that our western world's schools and media do not teach, do not suggest.<br />Every person I know who has read this books says it changes the way they walk through the world, the way they see, the way they know.<br />It discusses ideas that impinge upon parapsychology, shamanism, Carlos Castaneda's works, intuition, healing...<br />The book is a precious gift that will make you feel joy and sadness-- joy from knowing the possibilities of being human, and the beauty of the Sng'oi, sadness, because the Sng'oi were reported to be &quot;absorbed&quot; by the Malaysian culture several years ago. They are gone.<br />Thom Hartmann, who wrote the forward to the book, has written several other books which share a similar vision-- Prophet's Way, Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight, and Greatest Spiritual Secret.<br />Read this book and see if you can find a way to begin seeing and knowing, of being human, as the Sng'oi did, and see if you can find a part of them in your heart.	2001-08-14

He was invited because they like to meet with people whose ideas have the potential to make the world a better place. This book has already begun to change the world-- one person at a time. I know at least 50 people who have read it and they think about the planet, about values, about what it means to be a human in a different way. It will change you too. You'll read the paper and watch the news differently, see ways things could be better, make different choices.<br />Hartmann is a blend of James Michener and Rachel Carson, telling a gripping story that starts before the beginning of human history and leads up to the present--but rather than being about Hawaii or Chesapeake or Texas, as Michener covered, Thom covers the world's ecology and energy.<br />This is the kind of book which starts movements with millions of people heartfully involved. It's a book every student--and, indeed, every citizen of the world, should read.<br />Thom's newest book, at this writing, Unequal Protection, is another great book and it has the potential to help make the world a better place too.

And he helps us to understand what helps in not only cultivating the plant, but also in nourishing the bloom and retaining the memories of the petals and the aroma of the flower's sweet scent.<br />I love this book. It's title tells one big part of the story-- after you become enlightened, you still have to do ordinary stuff.<br />I've been in a field (biofeedback) where people are often seeking enlightenment and higher states of consciousness. This book makes it so simply and beautifully clear that even after you've had an incredible, peak, God-connected experience that changes your life, you still must go on and do the ordinary things that are required to stay alive-- &quot;chop wood and carry water&quot; as the Zen saying goes.<br />The book tells many inspiring and uplifting stories that show how long trained, disciplined, gifted masters who have achieved degrees of enlightenment still retained their human flaws and liabilities. The idea is to learn to carry the enlightenment back to the ordinary world functions we must all still engage in-- to do the laundry while still connected to you higher consciousness, your better self.<br />The true value in this book is that it prepares you for what could otherwise be a letdown. If a person goes in search of enlightenment-- ecstasy--  and expects to have everything change, then, even if he or she does find those blissful moments of ecstasy, they may not be appreciated, treasured, or even acknowledged.	2001-07-06

New Mind, New Body : Bio-Feedback, New Directions for the Mind by Barbara B. Brown<br />First Book on Biofeedback<br />This is a great book. When it first came out in hard cover in 1974, it was  telling the story of biofeedback to the world for the first time. Hugh Downs, of 60 Minutes fame, wrote the foreword. This book is still worth reading. It give a great overview of most of the applications of biofeedback, except for the new applications of EEG, which Jim Robbin's Symphony in the Brain does a great job at catching us up on. It also leaves out many some of the newer cardiorespiratory approaches such as heart rate variability and respiratory sinus arrhythmia feedback, But, to my knowledge, no books have yet been written which cover these areas. (tapes of workshops are available)<br />Other areas not covered, include more advanced EMG applications, including incontinence, rehab, multichannel EMG kinesiological assessment....<br />But, even without those areas covered, this is a great book and anyone working with biofeedback should get a copy, particularly practitioners.<br />Barbara Brown was one of the early pioneers in the development and popularization of biofeedback.  She did her research at the VA Hospital in Sepulveda California and was one of the cofounders of the original Biofeedback Research Society of America, with Elmer Green (Beyond Biofeedback) and Joe Kamiya (web book Textbook of Brain Biofeedback.)  I was fortunate to get to know her a bit, having breakfast with her several years in a row at the annual biofeedback meeting (now AAPB, for which I am currently Public information officer.)<br />She was a tough crusty little gal. It must have taken that kind of feistiness to work in a field that was just being created, standing up against a much bigger medical model that, at the time believed that the autonomic nervous system was the &quot;involuntary&quot; one. She, and her early colleagues (Basmajian, Green, Kamiya, Taub, Budzynski, to name a few) obliterated the concept of the involuntary nervous system, scientifically proving (or inspiring further research that showed) that people could learn to control just about any physiological function that was fed back using biofeedback technology.<br />While out of print, this book is usually fairly easy to find in Amazon's used section, used bookstores or other sources. I always try to keep extra copies to hand out to my clients (in addition to Symphony in the Brain.)<br />I'd rate it a five star, except that it is already a quarter century old, and does not cover all biofeedback applications.iterated the concept of the involuntary nervous system, scientifically proving (or inspiring further research that showed) that people could learn to control just about any physiological function that was fed back using biofeedback technology.<br />While out of print, this book is usually fairly easy to find in Amazon's used section, used bookstores or other sources.

It opened my eyes. Imagine seeing a computer tower, but not knowing anything about what's inside. Then, you read a book that explains not only what the different components are, but also how they work, how you can install them, select which ones to choose, fix them, understand why certain features are better than others. McKee does this for you with the internal elements, dynamics and dimensions of story.<br />You can tell how much I like a book by how much I mark it up. This book is covered with markings. Here's how much it inspired me. I went on to take McKee's workshop, which you can find out about on the web. He's more than a lecturer, more like an entertainer, and the workshop, which covers the material in the book is well worth the price. Supposedly, 45,000+n people have taken the workshop. Word has it that some movie studios have literally included some aspects of McKee's core criteria for a good story in their contracts. (and that when McKee found out about it, he insisted they pull the verbiage.)<br />Bottom line. This is a fascinating, brilliant book. It got me started exploring the wealth of other great writings on the creation of stories, including Syd Field, Christopher Vogler, Lynda Seger, James Bonnet, Michael Hauge, James Frey,  Carol Bly and more. I became so intrigued with the whole idea of describing all the elements, dimensions and aspects of story creation that I've put together a meeting with dozens of people, including McKee, Seger, Field, Bonnet, Vogler, Bly committed to participating in a discussion of story science.<br />This book is Primarily about Story Structure. It's a left brain approach to understanding what goes into making a story work. It offers principles which are worth reading over several times. But one thing I discovered was that the other side of writing is not structural. Structural concepts are powerful and highly useful in the development of your work, but I like to consider them the bones of the story. You still have to put flesh on those bones, and you get that flesh from your own inner creativity-- from taping your experience, your unconscious, the deepest parts of your self.<br />Put the bones of structure together with your deep inner self and you get a meaningful masterpiece, or at least something with meaning to you.ook is Primarily about Story Structure.

I read Lew Hunter's book on screenwriting and found myself thinking up all kinds of great new ideas for my novel, and then, as I went through the book further, actually started taking the first steps to writing a screenplay.<br />This is a basic book. I'm not enough of an expert on scripts to judge the script that Hunter wrote which is included in the book. But I found the advice helpful and, perhaps more important, inspiring. I've taken McKee's workshop. He's brilliant, and he disagrees with Hunter on issues of story structure, and things like page count for when different aspects of story occur. There is plenty of lively debate in the field of screenwriting on how stories are put together. And sometimes name-calling to go along with it. Lew Hunter takes a more conservative approach, toeing the Aristotelian three act play line, and he explains why he feels that the first act should end around page 17 of a 100-110 page script. You better believe this will garner disagreement, especially in light of groundbreaking films like Memento, or Pulp Fiction. But he does give his rationale for his approach, and this helps the reader to make up his own mind. My own screenplay, will definitely not be a straight linear story, but it just may end up that the 2nd act does spiral  somewhere near page 17.<br />But the bottom line for me was that this book moved me. As far as being a writer is concerned, I've done reasonably well, with published non-fiction articles in OMNI, SUCCESS, FAMILY HEALTH, and even a cover article in WRITER's DIGEST.<br />I had actually bought the Hunter book, started it, then, having also purchased a number of other books, put it aside. But Hunter's name does come up a lot in the world of screenwriters, so I revisited the book. Sure enough, it took me to the next level. The people who have criticized Hunter's book are primarily comparing Hunter's book to books that are mostly about story, not about creating a screenplay. There's a difference.<br />...vel.

We understand our lives and our world through story. Perhaps stories are so much a part of us because human life itself has the structure of story. Each of us has a central character. Each of us knows, better than we know anything, that life has a beginning, middle and end. We need stories because we are stories.&quot; He takes the position that &quot;news stories offer sacred, societal narratives with shared values and beliefs, with lessons and themes, and with exemplary models that instruct and inform.&quot; Stories told by the media are used as examples which teach readers what are good and bad ways to behave. Good guys are lauded, &quot;bad&quot; guys are ripped apart.  For his &quot;data&quot; Lule compares stories in the New York Times and other major papers. It is fascinating to see the differences, and to see, with his insightful narration, how, over time, the stories changed, and even, how the stories told by the Times actually changed the news itself, and affected how others reported on the actual events. Lule lists what he calls seven myths, which he says &quot;appear frequently, if not daily, in the news. They are primordial stories that have guided human storytelling for ages. And they guide the news and stories of today.&quot; The myths are: The Victim, The Scapegoat, The Hero, The Good Mother,  The Trickster, The Other World and The Flood. I found the book a fascinating read. I bought it because I thought I could learn better how the media thinks and digests news, so I could use this to my benefit in PR efforts I occasionally engage in.  I was right. It will help. This would also be a great resource to any journalist who wants to learn how to tap further and deeper into the archetypal, mythical resonances in the hearts of readers.

I bought it because I was interested in how neurology could explain religious experience. Then, as I went from chapter to chapter, my expectations would be surpassed, again and again.  As the organizer of The Futurehealth Winter Brain Meeting, I have a good feel for what is going on in the world of brain research, particularly around the issues of consciousness and spirituality.<br />This book covers some new ground, with new PET scan data, but more important, it is a well woven exploration of a new model which covers how the neurological functioning of the brain not only explains, but inevitably leads to the creation of myths, rituals and the kinds of transcendent mystical experiences upon which religions are founded.<br />The authors  have done their homework so they can discuss the neurobiology of the brain from a renaissance person's rounded perspective.<br />Since I am also very interested in the art and science of story, it was a wonderful treat to discover the chapter on the neurobiological foundations for the creation of myths.<br />It's a controversial book which raises plenty of questions. I give the authors lots of credit for not trying to provide, or suggesting they have all the answers. But they do raise good questions.<br />So, if you want to have a transcendent religious or mystical experience, read the book and learn how to deafferentize the part of your parietal loves they describe with explicit detail.

Some are massive attempts to cover all different subjects. Some cover a single subject, like love, politics or friendship. Others cover specific sports or authors.  This one covers the big area of things positive. As a lecturer and writer on Positivity and Positive Psychology and a collector of over 400 quotation books, I find this one a real gem. It is loaded with thousands of great quotes you won't find anywhere else as well as popular quotes that show up in the biggest and best giant quote collections.<br />What's nice about it is the inclusion of spiritual quotes and quotes from eastern approaches, as well as more current psychology and new age texts, authors and speakers.<br />You can pick a topic for a lecture or writing project or just peruse it randomly and you can expect to be uplifted and inspired.<br />I had a pleasant surprise one day. After my 10 year old son was browsing it while sitting on the John browsing the book (he picked it up of his own accord and was reading it. That's great!) -- a he came out and showed me how he'd looked in the index and discovered a quote attributed to me-- one from a cover article I'd written for Writer's Digest in 1983, which had later been included among Reader's Digest's Points to Ponder.	2001-04-10

Most cover primarily western european turf. This collection paints with a much broader brush, offering a wealth of proverbs from all over the world.<br />The book offers over 18,000 proverbs, and half of them are from far flung languages, like Swahili, Yoruba, Basque, Egyptian, Lebanese, Serbian, Croatian, Thai, Vietnamese, Hindi, Tamil, Japanese and many more.<br />It is no wonder. Wolfgang Mieder may be THE preeminent expert on proverbs. Check out De Proverbia, a journal of proverbs available on the net (which I have no connection to other than interest in proverbs.)<br />A collection of proverbs or quotations is at one level, a string of precious gems of thought, loving selected and strung together by someone who has an infinite number of thoughts and ideas to choose from. Mieder does a great job in his selections.<br />The book is organized by subject. Now some proverb and quotation collections clump their nuggets into a skimpy number of catchall subjects. But this book lists hundreds and hundreds of different subjects, making it more likely you will find the exact saying you are seeking.<br />I've always felt that one of the great values of studying the proverbs of different cultures is it helps us to understand the way they thin, their values and the stories they base their reactions upon. This book takes us further along the path to greater understanding.<br />I have over 400 books of quotations and proverbs, some dating back 300 and 400+ years. This is one of the best, because of its comprehensive inclusiveness.	2001-04-10

About 22 years ago, I sold my first freelance article to a national magazine. It was directly due to Writer's Market-- due to the solid nuts and bolts information you get, updated each year.<br />The book lists thousands of magazines, publishers and agents and the key info you need to intelligently contact them. You get chapter/articles which advise you on how to research a publisher before making contact, and then, how to submit your writing queries. Then, it lists thousands of magazines, categorizing them by demographics, subject matter, regions, etc. They give you the pay rates, lengths of the articles or stories, they seek, topics they are extra interested in, who to contact, how to get a sample copy and writer's guidelines. They tell you whether the publication accepts simultaneous submissions or e-mail proposals, and if they want S.A.S.E.s And if you don't understand all those terms, they provide a glossary of writer's terminology.<br />Since I started buying Writer's Market, (and the monthly magazine also published by the same company, Writer's Digest) I have had articles published in Success, OMNI (10 articles in OMNI alone) Family Health, and cover articles in Writer's Digest (on coming up with article ideas) and the National Enquirer (on arthritis pain relief and on vitamins)<br />Since I write on topics that grab my interst, it's important that I have a fast way to access info which publications cover which topics. This book does the job. I've recently  begun writing poetry, so it was only natural that I got the same publisher's counterpart publication on Poetry. It was a fun read and helped me find a website that accepted two of my poems right away, plus, it reminded me of a publication I subscribe to, which I didn't think of for submitting poetry to.	2001-04-10

There's the massive Catholic Quotations, Burton Stephenson's Bible Quotations,  Mead's Bible Quotations, Quotation books from the Bahai, Hindu and Buddhist faiths, but this one does the best job of blending together spiritual sources and literary sources on spiritual topics from the broadest range.<br />Not only that, it covers a wide range of topics that not all might call spiritual, and I think this is good. Like the Buddhist saying goes, after enlightenment you still chop wood and carry water.<br />This is a subject categorized book, which makes it fun to read and easier to use for source material for lecture or writing projects. Or, just put it in your bathroom and get inspired a few column inches at a time.<br />It's a big book, with 10,000+ quotes, so there is a lot of great material, much of it unique.<br />I've always felt that one of the best things about quotation books are the authors and books they introduce you to, so you can pursue them in greater depth. If you like to read spiritual material, this book is a like a chocolate sampler loaded with tasty goodies which will help you learn what new flavors to further pursue.	2001-04-10

He, unlike most authors of books on ADD, takes a much more positive perspective, so you don't feel like you have a brain disease. Some of the other authors' aproaches can really lead to low self esteem. My daughter, now finishing her sophomore year in college, with a 3.5 average, found Hartmann's ideas liberating, compared to the brain disease model. This book pulls together Thom Hartmanns latest and classic thoughts on ADD, using his Hunter in a Farmer's World point perspective on people with ADD.<br />It offers views on school and work-- how to succeed, how to make them better.<br />In a world where diversity is diminishing and uniformity is being ramrodded down our throats, Thom Hartmann's books make us take another look at some mainstream assumptions.<br />My daughter and I are happy withour ADD-ness. We wouldn't want it any other way, and there are plenty of other people out there who have adapted successfully to being ADD-- entrepreneurs, researchers, surgeons, reporters, programmers, detectives, salesmen, mechanics-- a lot of the people who are at the cutting edge of making a difference in this world.<br />Thom Hartmann's book helps parents and adults understand what's going on with ADDD and offers strategies to cope so ADDers can be successful and happy.<br />Before you take or put a child on Ritalin or some other drug, read this book. You may still choose to use the medication, but you'll understand the biology, anthropology and politics better and also become aware of other, non-drug options.<br />Others who give a reasonable picture on ADD include Lynn Weiss, Joel Sears and Lynda Thompson, John Ratey, and Ed Hallowell.<br />Check out his website at thom hartmann dot com to find out more about him.	2001-03-27

I went to the original texts by Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck, and they were great for theoretical info, but this book was THE BEST for simple, easy to understand discussion of how to use the principles and techniques of cognitive behavioral therapies to help control anxiety, depression, self esteem, moods and other aspects of your life. It provides short, simple explanations and well thought through exercises you can use to take great charge of your life.<br />It is an excellent book for therapists who want to have a quick referral resource for patients and it is a super self help book.<br />Like the authors say, it is not a replacement for treatment by a doctor, but it sure goes a long way for helping some basic issues. I've used the techniques listed here along with biofeedback interventions (see more about them and how to read articles I've written on my website listed in my profile)<br />Bottom line-- for self help in cognitive therapy, consider this the layman's bible, and an essential bibliotherapy resource for therapists..	2001-03-10

It is subject- rather than author organized, which makes it easier to browse by topic, in my mind, making it more useful for someone seeking quotations for writing or speaking.<br />As a quotation book collector (see my other reviews) owning over 400 quote books, I'd rate this one in the top five percent. When I discovered my 1942 copy in a used bookstore and realized what a treasure trove of new material it contains (lots!-- over 1300 pages of smaller type. I estimate it contains at least 30,000 quotations,) it really made my day. There are only so many really great books which are delicious treats. So many are re-packagings of older ones. This book contains just a super batch of idea nuggets, collected by one of the brightest journalistic minds of the time.<br />Mencken basically took his quote collection and made it into a book which would supplement the popular books of the time-- Bartlett's, Hoyt and Stevenson. His stated goals were to date all the quotes and proverbs, leave out the fluff (platitudes), and add a lot more topics.<br />He comments, &quot; Some immemorial imbecilities have been added deliberately , on the ground that it is just as interesting to note how foolish men have been as to note how wise they have been.&quot;<br />Now maybe it's just my read of him, but Mencken's choices reflect his acerbic wit.<br />I've been working too long on putting my own quotation book together, subject by subject (600+ done so far) and this is one book I always check out for both the unusual and unique thought and the most familiar ones, which he seems to nail very often. As a matter of fact, it is remarkable how often he does this.<br />It's been around along time, and so, unless it has been seriously updated, which I doubt, it is mostly good for more classic quotes. But it is excellent, and always a fun browse.<br />Since it's about the same price as the Burton Stevenson Home Book of Quotations, also called the MacMillan book of Maxims, Proverbs......  or something like that, it's not an easy choice between the two. This book spares you from some pretty sappy, bland and uninspiring stuff you'll find in the massive Stevenson book. But the Stevenson book is soooo much bigger that I'd probably pick it first, over just about any other quotation book. This book is certainly among the top ten though, for someone who wants a comprehensive quotation book library.<br />The day after the W inauguration, here's a line, from this book from Jefferson, That government is the strongest of which every man feels himself a part.&quot; Thomas Jefferson: Letter to H.D.

It has well over 50,000 quotations, is organized by subject, and is close to 3000 pages.<br />This book, in one of it's edition prefaces, makes it clear that it is not a book of familiar quotations.  It is not uncommon, that you will find a subject area which has several pages of fine print quotations dedicated to it, in comparison to a handful of quotes that are found in the average collection.<br />If you consider the book, based on the cost per quotation, it's actually a very good deal.<br />Because it is so comprehensive, some of the quotes are classics, some are highly familiar, but to me, the gems are the unusual ones, all with excellent source information. It's amazing that such a vast compendium does such a good job, and that it was done before the age of computers. (First ed was in the 30's.)<br />If you want the biggest and best, this is it, whether it goes by the Macmillan name or the Home book of Quotations name. The only thing you will be lacking will be the most recent quotes. So.... get a recent Simpsons Conemporary Quotations, and maybe Justin Kaplan's Bartletts, and the Thesaurus of Quotations, and you should be in pretty good shape, quotation colection-wise .

First, the name is pronounced chick-sent-mih-high. And it is worth remembering because this is one book that will probably be around in 100 or 200 years. It is that important. Certainly, it is one of, if not the most important books in the positive psychology field. The author has spent his life researching the Flow state, and in the process,  has inspired hundreds, if not thousands of other researchers to further pursue this profound, yet simple concept.<br />Flow is a state that artists experience when they are feeling in the groove, when time seems to just fly and the &quot;work&quot; seems to soar.<br />One key ingredient of flow is a challenge that can be reasonably responded to with existing resources. That tells us that it is important, if we are going to achieve Flow States, to challenge ourselves regularly.<br />The book walks the reader through some of the basic research and then, to conclusions about how this amazing concept affects us all, and how it affects people who insist on finding the flow in their lives.<br />I discovered MC's work about 12 years ago, and while working on a book titled THE HAPPINESS RESPONSE, had my first conversation with him. He's one man who walks the talk-- kind, accessible. His book opens a door to a new way of thinking about living, about psychology, and it has had a major role in the development of the field of positive psychology. Matter of fact, if you are interested in positive psychology you absolutely must have this book.<br />If you want to get a handle on some concrete aspects of finding more meaning in your life, on specific strategies for feeling more alive, then read this book.<br />In my lectures and workshops, I present the Anatomy of Positive Experience. One key element is the optimization of the moment-- Once you realize you are having a positive experience, there are many strategies you can use to make the experience longer, stronger, deeper, more meaningful, shared with someone you love, etc. This book gives you many specific ideas on how to do just these things.<br />In the annual meeting I organize, The Optimal Functioning and Positive Psychology Meeting, it is common for trainers and researchers to describe how winners stay in the moment to perform their best. Flow is about the same phenomenon. But not just about winning, it's also about the little moments too.<br />You don't have to paint a masterpiece or climb a mountain to find flow. Just stretch a little. And this book and MC's other works help you learn HOW to stretch so you feel the FLOW.  This is one of those books I've recommended to hundreds of people. Try it.

This is not an easy read. But it is brilliant and a real eye-opener and a bridge builder with concrete, practical suggestions for building a \\"marriage\\" between science and religion-- sense and soul. It takes a historical look at the pre-modern, modern, post-modern, Romantic, Idealist approaches, starting with Kant through Nietszche and Wittgenstein (at least that's how far I've gotten.)<br />Wilber discusses how it is tempting to look back to pre-modern times for answers on how to resolve the differences between science and the more ethereal spheres of human functioning. But he argues that there are fallacies in going that route, since we must give up the benefits which came after those nostalgic times. We need to move forward and weave together science with an integrational approach to those higher functions-- an approach that treats the scientific approach as an essential but not unique or minimal means.<br />He points out a new way of thinking about a science which includes changes in cognitive and even spiritual experiencing-- and also discusses the liabilities of only using a flat, physical approach to dealing with processes which include emergent properties.<br />I am confident that once we reach this point, the \\"technology\\" (just as Robert Thurman, in INNER REVOLUTION characterizes Tibetan mental discipline is a technology) will become a highly valued tool used in health care and education.<br />Wilber suggests that even nonlinear and quantum-type scientific approaches still end up \\"flattening\\" the appraisal of processes which are more than just objective, ie., including social, moral, artistic, soul, spiritual dimensions. He characterizes empirical evaluation/science as \\"it\\", spiritual/moral as \\"we\\" and artistic as \\"I\\" based ways of knowing and experiencing.<br />Wilber suggests that in the modern world, the good thing is that science art and spirit/morals have successfully differentiated, whereas in the old world, these three were all combined together, so that religious leaders, for example, controlled thinking about science and art.<br />The differentiation was good, in that it led to the ideas of democracy, freedom, logical explanation of the world, independent creative expression in the arts, etc.<br />But, Wilber says, the differentiation went too far, and science became so powerful that its viewpoint has virtually wiped out the other two viewpoints as legitimate ways of looking at the world, that this is pathological.<br />He suggests that the way to fix the problem is to integrate the three different ways of experiencing and knowing the world.<br />Interestingly, Wilber dedicates considerable space to discuss how the idea of Paradigms is usually wrongly used-- that Popper never intended for the idea of a paradigm shift to apply to any new idea, and he points out that Popper never uses the term anymore.<br />Bottom line is that we need to apply the same standards to any of the three categories of knowing-- whether to the material, mental or spiritual worlds--<br />1) define the methodology and training and experience required to to competently evaluate the condiditions-- whether using a microscope, using a specific cognitive activity or engaging in a specific meditation practice.<br />2) describe the results/experience produced by following the methodology<br />3) share these findings to cofirm that they are the same for anyone appropriate prepared to perform the methodology.<br />So, for example, to evaluate a given spiritual approach, a form of meditation by Nuns, for example, and any relevant results, then by sharing these reports and findings, we can determine whether there is consistency.<br />Wilber suggests the same approach can be used to scientifically explore what happens going all the way up to the highest levels of ecstatic spiritual union.<br />There's a lot of epistemological, post-modernity, phenomenology jargon to wade through, but there's a lot of meat too.

It is a valuable, unique resource, primarily for professionals and practitioners. It provides both theoretical and practical technique information. But it is probably not the best book for the average layman wanting to deal with stress more effectively. Laymen (and professionals) should consider the Relaxation and Stress Workbook, in that case. But professionals will want the Lehrer Woolfolk, compilation because of the detailed theoretical grounding provided for the techniques, which include Autogenic training, Clinically Standardized meditation, Progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback.

It provides a wonderfully comprehensive, detailed picture of a wide range of biofeedback applications, modalities, issues and techniques. Edited and partially written by Mark Schwartz, founder of the Mayo Clinic Biofeedback program, and Frank Andrasik, both past presidents of AAPB (Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback,) the book offers an encyclopedic amount of information on the  most frequently used forms of non-EEG biofeedback. It only has one chapter on EEG biofeedback-- though that one, by Joel Lubar, is an excellent. Even practitioners getting into work which focusses primarily on EEG should buy this book and include in their library, since it offers valuable perspectives on working with the kinds of clients/patients likely to be encountered.<br />if you are getting into a practice, working with headache, stress disorder, behavioral medicine, etc. then this book should be on  your bookshelf.<br />Frankly, being a bit of a bibliomaniac, I have at least 40 different biofeedback books-- one of the largest libraries on the subject anywhere. I've also co-edited two books on biofeedback myself (published in Russia.) As a biofeedback practitioner since 1972, a biofeedback product inventor, software developer international meeting organizer and entrepreneur, I have recommended the book to hundreds of people and have probably sold, over the years, through my business, at least 300 copies. I know that at least three or four years ago, before the release of the 2nd edition, I heard that over 12,000 copies had been sold. That's pretty amazing for a book of this sort.<br />other good books on biofeedback include:  Basmajian, Fuller-Von Bozzay,  and for EEG biofeedback:  Wise, Evans &amp; Abarbanel	2000-11-02

But once I started, I couldn't put it down. It is quite unusual, and not the kind of book you would ever expect from a writer reputed to be a feminist. It is not at all Cruddy. It's an awesome book, but not one I'd want my ten year old to read. It's too violent. But for over 17, it's a good story.<br />The fascinating thing about this book is the way the writer  oozes through into the story. I say ooze, because, Lynda Barry is the closest thing to R. Crumb, the weird cartoonist of the sixties, that a person with female anatomy  is going to come. So, while this is, at one level, a horrific story of teenage angst, it at the same time has a strange edge which adds something very special and uniquely Lynda Barryish to it.<br />Read it and be pleasantly surprised-- and horrified. &lt;G&gt;	2000-10-31

It was one of my favorites back then. It became even more fascinating when I read, somewhere, that it was read by Charles Manson as a &quot;how-to&quot; bible. (Manson's bizzarre story does parrallel this in many ways.<br />So, if you want to get an understanding of where Charles Manson got his inspiration, read this book.<br />Re-reading it was still fun. 30 years had erased most of my memories of the details, so it was a fun read. But this time it didn't feel quite as smooth, and it felt a bit too overtly didactic and preachy. I don't mind a story with a message. but this one comes on a bit too thick sometimes. Of course you get the same thing from loads of other authors. Overall, this should be considered one of the all-time classics of Science fiction, with the Foundation Series, Ringworld, 2001, to name a few.	2000-10-31

This one is much better and also offers suggestions for other related headings.) I've found the quality of the quotes to be excellent, with a nice mix of contemporary and classic sources.<br />As an avid quotation and quotation book collector, with over 400 books, some dating back over 400 years, (as well as a website of 1000-- a small fraction of the quotations I've collected)  I have to say that this is one I keep handy, along with about 15 or 20 others. If you are a writer, speaker, teacher, etc., or if you are looking for a gift for someone who loves ideas, then this book is a very worthwhile investment.<br />One useful way to enjoy this book is to read specific topics  to get an idea how a lot of different people think about that subject. This can often give you a first introduction to a writer you may want to get to know better. Then, you'll want to, perhaps, next look at a quotation book organized by author, or-- go directly to the works of the author.	2000-10-31

Bartlett's is, by far, the most well known of all quotations books. But it may or not be the best one for your needs. If you want a book which will help you find our who wrote quotations that you encounter, then it's an excellent choice. If you want a book that takes you on a stroll through the history of ideas, starting with the earliest quotations, and moving through to the most recent, then this is a good book for you, perhaps the best. This can be a great way to discover which authors' ideas you like, so you can identify whole books by those authors. It's a great way to introduce nuggets of brilliance to your kids too.<br />But if you are preparing a speech, writing a book or article which you want to find good quotes on specific subjects, this is not a good choice. There are some wonderfully better books than this one with more quotations and which are far better organized. They are all organized by subject category. It makes all the difference in the world, compared to going to the index in the back of the book, then searching for each quote referred to in the subject index, as Bartlett's forces you to do.<br />If you are, like me, a quotation book collector (I have over 400, dating back to 1590 and a computer database of over 50,000 quotatiosn) then you'll want an edition of Bartlett's (I have at least half a dozen different editions, and the contents do change from edition to edition.)<br />Other good subject categorized quotation books include . H.L. Mencken's A New Dictionary of Quotations Awesome collection Dictionary of Thoughts by Tryon Edwards, over 100 years since first published, but much friendlier Burton Stevenson's Home Book of quotations, with over 40,000 quotes also titled as MacMillan Dictionary of Quotations, Big, solidly done. Wolfgang Mieder's Encyclopedia of World Proverbs (not quotes, but a great collection by one of the world's experts) International Thesaurus of Quotations-- very comprehensive, large list,and, a new addition-- Quotationary. I've also put together an amazon list of quotation books.<br />I have to say though, that over the 10+ years I have been working on my own quotation book, with its 600+ subject categories, I have always used Bartletts as one of the measures of quality.<br />Have fun.ry.

This isn't like that. WHile reading it could start you on the path to really making major positive changes in your life, the book is more of a story about the history of the field and description of its promise and potential than a how-to book.  I've been in the field of neurofedback since 1972, but I still learned alot from the big picture, in depth  story Jim Robbins spent several years researching and telling. This book tells of the promise, the potential of the new brainwave biofeedback, and it tells a history of its development that could easily be made into a movie, with fascinating characters and multiple plots.  I recommend it to people to read so they will learn all the different aspects and potentials of neurofeedback, since it does such a thorough job. But I have to warn them that it is not all pretty. The people who have moved the field forward are human, with flaws. But that makes the STORY even better.  Since it came out, articles in the New York Times Book Review and Newsweek, and more have referred positively to the book. It's a good way to find out if you or someone you care about is a potential candidate for neurofeedback, because in all likelihood, your doctor is not going to mention it.<br />Of course the wild history of neurofeedback continues to go on.

I haven't read a magic/fantasy adventure novel in quite a while. I read this one because my 16 year old son's best friend Jason, gobbles up this  genre, and I wanted to see what it looks like nowadays, so I asked him to  give me one of his favorites. I found the book lush in its description of  the pre-industrial setting. Characters were well developed and the plot,  with multiple threads was superbly woven. The story introduces a  fascinating concept that takes the idea of indentured servitude or slavery  in a fascinating direction-- endowment of special properties. A royal, or  soldier can be &quot;endowed&quot; with the strength, glamour,  intelligence, stamina, etc.  of another person. This is done using magic.  The person who contributes the endowment loses that &quot;asset.&quot; But  it allows for a very smart, strong, energized royal or soldier. They even  do it with horses.  The use of this fascinating concept is explored to some  amazing ends. I zipped through the 600+ pages in under three days. Now I'm  reading the sequel, Brotherhood of The Wolf. One caution. It does have some  more graphic, I'd say PG13 rated, brief  romantic descriptions. THey're not  really sexually explicit. But especially since the book starts off with a  bit of romance, I'm not sure my 10 year old, who loves the Harry Potter  series, would enjoy it. I guess, if he got past the first 25 pages, he'd  start breezing through it like I did.<br />It's fun read. Enjoy it.	2000-09-01

Rony<br />This was the first book I purchased in my  search tomake sense of the domain name business. It provides great  information on the details of the domain name naming system and the history  of the organizations involved. It also provides excellent information on  trademark considerations and issues. If you are an attorney, or anyone  seriously getting into the domain name business, you should have this in  your library.<br />Rony is highly knowledgeable about the minutiae of the  domain name registration rules, and offers a great history with some  examples of cases of trademark cases and squatting that are highly useful  for understanding the way things work.  She's now consulting as an expert  in this area, a clear sign that her expertise is credible with corporations  and courts.<br />  The book does not cover such considerations as the  creative and business consideration process of coming up with a unique  domain name. There's another book that goes into this topic in more  detail--How to choose and Protect a great Name for Your website.<br />Neither  book covers factors which contribute to the value of a dmain name,  finding  better prices for name registration, websites and strategies for doing  research on names you are considering.<br />Rob Kall, author, domainnamereport	2000-08-07

All may roads may lead to Rome, but for me, this year, all books seemed to  lead to Joseph Campbell's Hero With 1000 Faces.<br />I have discovered that  this book is probably one of the most influential, widely read books of the  20th century. It's no wonder the author, Joseph Campbell, was featured in a  Bill Moyers special on The Power of Myth (with an accompanying book, as  usual for Bill Moyer's specials.)<br />I was reading books on writing-- on  story structure-- Particularly, Christopher Vogler's excellent Writer's  Journey, and it was based on this book. Ironically, I was already reading  another of Campbell's series of books on myth. But then I started looking  deeper into this realm-- the idea of the Hero's journey, -- the call to  adventure, refusing the call,  finding a mentor, encountering threshold  guardians, crossing the threshold, facing the worst evil, winning the  elixir--- and I discovered that dozens of books have been written about the  concepts Joseph Campbell first broached.<br />It's such a powerful idea, and  so useful in conceptualizing life's changes. I used it as an element in a  presentation I just gave this past weekend on how the art and science of  story can be applied to healing and helping people grow. 80% of the people  attending the lecture were familiar with the concept.<br />This is such  powerful material, you might consider essential for helping you understand  the way movies are made, and how the contemporary world has been affected  by advertising and the loss of sacred rituals in everyday life.<br />One way  I gauge a book is by how many marks I make in the margins, to indicate wise  ideas or quotable material ( I collect quotes, and quotation books  big-time, owning over 400 quotation books) and this book's margins are just  packed. The depth of knowledge in mythology and anthropology is awesome,  providing a wealth of examples, metaphors, ancient stories and myths which  deepen your understanding of human nature. The only problem with this book  is how often, in conversations, I've found it to be relevant, whether  talking about a friend who is going through some tough times, or someone  who is making some changes in his business.<br />Rob Kally problem with this book  is how often, in conversations, I've found it to be relevant, whether  talking about a friend who is going through some tough times, or someone  who is making some changes in his business.<br />Rob Kall	2000-08-07

It does provide some  useful information on coming up with your own domain name and it does  provide lots of info on trademark considerations in choosing a domain name.  It is primarily for the trademark considerations that I give it the three  star rating. While the Ronan's book on Domain Names (The Domain Name  Handbook; High Stakes and Strategies in Cyberspace by Ellen Rony, Peter R.  Rony) does a nice job on covering trademark history, this book does a  better job from a &quot;How-to&quot; point of view, which  is not  surprising since it is published by an interesting publishing house, Nolo,  which puts out lots of how-to law books. I expect to order more of  these.<br />By my read, about 55 pages of the book are clearly related to  domain names. The rest of the book is more related to trademark  considerations. It's almost as if they took a book on trademarks and  modified it and added the pages on domain names.<br />Since, if you screw up  on a trademark factor with even a single domain name registration, it could  cost you at least the $16 or less cost of a name registration, this book's  $20 cost is well worth the investment and time persuing its detailed  trademark coverage, to prevent running into trademark problems.<br />Rob Kall,  author, domainnamereport	2000-08-07

This book is a treasure trove of  subject headings which have never appeared in a quotation book before, such  as: mitral stenosis, molecular biology, rheumatoid spondylitis,  specialization, concussion and constipation to aging, with classic  quotables, like Aristotle, Petrarch and Duc de La Rochefoucauld, to more  modern scientists and physicians, like Ignatz Semmelweis, William Mayo,  Rene Dubos and Hans Selye.<br />The best quotation books help you discover new  writers you want to delve into more deeply, by giving you enough  information and inspiring or stimulating thoughts so you seek out the full  text source. This book does this too. It's a great read, full of  illuminating ideas.<br />Rob Kall QuotationsCentral	2000-08-07

It explores universal truths while telling a solid story that keeps  you reading through, not wanting to take a break to work or sleep.<br />It  seems that there is a movement towards describing a new theology-- a vision  of faith, of spirituality which transcends the traditional religions, while  still respecting them. This book does a nice job of doing that. It doesn't  tolerate the BS-- the modifications to the original teachings-- which  organized religion has encumbered the big ones with, which is refreshing  and in some cases, pleasantly surprising.<br />I read a lot of non-fiction,  (recently Ken Wilber's Marriage of Sense and Soul, Robert Thurman's Inner  Revolution, Joseph Campbell's Hero with a thousand Faces, Gary Schwartz's  Living Energy Universe) so it is fun to take a break with an entertaining,  yet, at the same time visionary, illuminating and fun to read STORY. <br />I  expect to be giving a lot of copies of this book away as gifts-- certainly  one to my daughter. <br />It's nice to find an author who does a good job with  both non-fiction and fiction.

Susan Perry has taken one of the most  pleasant, challenging, and sometimes difficult to achieve aspects of the  art of writing and woven together a discussion of the science and art.  Flow is a thoroughly researched concept, with hundreds of studies  illuminating this unique yet ubiquitous process. I've been aware of the  research on it since the eighties. And Flow has played a major role in my  own model of Positive Psychology and Positivity, which I have lectured on  at numerous national professional meetings.

I read it after reading Robert McKee's Story Structure,  and then taking McKee's workshop. The integration of the Joeph Campbell  Hero With a 1000 Faces concept into story creation is brilliant.<br />McKee's  book is excellent and filled with great ideas and material and Vogler's  book does an amazing job of taking such a different approach to the same  topic-- creating great stories.<br />The mythic approach to story creation is  based on Campbell's study of the common elements and archetypes of  thousands of myths from cultures all over the world. Understanding the  model enables the writer to tap into deep, deep dimensions of being human.  I've found this book has helped me, not only in the novel I am working  on, but also in putting together lectures for my professional work and even  in creating web pages for my website.  Ironically, I had already begun  reading another of Campbell's books, and Vogler's book pointed me in the  direction of Hero with 1000 faces, which is also well worth reading. While  Vogler builds the bridges to the story idea, Campbell, of course, goes into  much greater depth in the mythic and archetypal dimensions. Put them  together and throw in McKee's story structure and you have a science of  story that will jump start the worst case of writer's block	2000-03-13

Beware!<br />Since then, I've read some great books on writing--  Christopher Vogler's THE WRITER's Journey, and Robert McKee's STORY  STRUCTURE.<br />I breezed through these, marking them up like crazy because  of all the good ideas.<br />I told a literary friend of mine about the books  I'd been reading and he pooh-poohed them, insisting that Gardner's was the  &quot;real thing.&quot;<br />So I went back and revisited it. I found it as  turgid as the first time. Now, you may think I am some kind of airhead who  doesn't do deep. But I am one of the few who actually finished reading  Foucault's Pendulum, and have recently finished Ken Wilber's Marriage of  Sense and Spirit-- a discussion of postmodernist scientific models and  paradigms, as well as the journals in brain research I usually read for my  profession I can read dense, difficult material!<br />Bottom line: I'd hate  to see this book turn someone off to writing when there are some great  books out there.

I really liked how the  history of so simple a device could be so fascinating.<br />So I found the  book. Being in health care, I was pleased to discover that so much of the  book covers the way that medical technology has bitten boack, and how we  have been, to some extent, misled on the &quot;wonders&quot; of modern  drugs and therapies.  For example, the dazzling emergency medical  techniques developed in Korea and Viet Nam now allow meergency docs to save  more crash victims lives, but that now allows more para and quadraplegics,  more brain-damaged to live at huge expense. It's good that they can be  saved, but expensive.<br />I've used this book as a source of some great  quotes and interesting facts in my lectures on alternative health care.<br />It really opens your eyes to see that a gee whiz technology can also  have &quot;bite-back&quot; effects you'd never think of.	2000-01-23

This book shouold be required reading by any health care provider, educator, counselor, etc. who works with ADD/ADHD.  It offers a positive, hopeful view of ADHD. The truth is, many, if not most of the leaders, visionaries, explorers, pioneers and people who make the big differences in this world have been or are people who would meet the characteristics of an ADD person. Hartmann's book explains it. if you are ADD or love someone who is, it wold be tragic for you to not know the ideas in this book.<br />If you listen to many of the \\"experts\\" on ADD/HD, people with this diagnosis are not only disordered, they are pathologically defective. Thom Hartmann went through this destructive labeling with his child, and came out of the dark tunnel with a new light-- people with ADD are Different-- Hunters in a Farmers world. And in many cases, they function better than the farmers... if the setting is right. This book should be required reading for parents of children with ADD and adults with ADD. It is a wonderful breath of fresh air for people who are feeling bad about the diagnosis and their future.<br />I'm a relatively successful person who is clearly ADD. Thom's way of thinking about it enables me, and my ADD daughter to be proud of our attentional differences. The human race evolved for millions of years as hunters, and for the last 10,000 years as farmers. What do you think evolution prepared us better for? This book will bolster your attitude for dealing with teachers and others who push Ritalin or other stimulants as a quick fix to your or your child's differences.	2000-01-13

The Living Energy Universe Gary Schwartz &amp; Linda Russek The living Energy Universe is an incredible book-- incredible because it is hard to believe, especially when you think of all the repercussions the theory it  proposes presents. But the authors do a very credible job of arguing for  its feasibility.<br /> Basically, it posits that every action, every  moment of existence is reflected out into the universe to reverberate and  interact as a living energy memory with the universe, including the myriad  of other living energy memories. The book ties together everything, from  eastern philosophical ideas of non-duality and connectedness to Rupert  Sheldrake's morphogenic field theory (which is elegantly explained) to the  phenomenon of organ transplant memory, in which recipients of heart and  other organ transplants develop habits or experience memories whcih could  only come from the organ donor.<br /> This theory has so much potential to  change the world and the way we think of it. I'm not just talking about  technology. It can change the way you think about God, death, the  afterlife, relationships, karma, organ transplants.<br /> A beautiful  aspect of this book is it manages to let the reader get to know the joyful,  loving personalities of its authors. And that even flows into the  theories-- theories filled with love.  The book is unusual for its  author, because it is the first book not written for a professional  audience. Gary Schwartz has a huge CV, with several hundred publications to  his credit, and he is one of the most respected psychologists in America.  It's a treat-- like candy for the mind-- (vitamin enriched&lt;g&gt;) to get  such a digestable big chunk of Schwartz's ideas (most likely made more  easily understood by his lifemate, Linda Russek.  Isaac Newton, in  crediting his scientific predecessors,  commented that he got his ideas by  standing on the shoulders of giants.  If you want to stand on an extra tall  pair of visionary shoulders, try the ones who wrote this book. As the  organizer of The Futurehealth Winter Brain Meeting, I've had a wonderful  opportunity to get to know some of the world's most brilliant visionary  scientists and thinkers. Gary Schwartz, a regular speaker at the  conference, is, among this stellar group of peers, regarded as somewhat  special, guaranteed to surprise and delight by not only expanding the  realms and reach of science, but by doing it with scintillating, clear  sparkle. He not only sees what others have never seen before, but he shares  his ideas with the excitement of discovery he must have experienced on his  own.<br /> It is a wonder to watch a room full of brilliant, world famous  brain researchers shake their heads in astonishment and surprise when Gary,  giving a lecture,  drops another of his new explosive ideas. There are  always a few who literally walk out, shocked by the boldness of the  proposals. But most keep coming back for more, because the ideas force us  (or better, lift us up) to see the world with new eyes, and that's a very  special gift. Read this book and you will change the way you see the world  and your relationship to it and everyone and eveything in it.  Take  Gary's advice, and read chapters 6 through the end first, before going into  the scientific explanation.

He told me he's taken McKee's workshop three times.  I've made my living as a full time writer for national publications, and  now write part time.  This book is a world treasure. McKee should get a  combination Nobel and Pulitzer-- a Nobel, because he has elucidated a  science of story creation. A Pulitzer, because it is a literary work with  the potential to influence so many.  It not only serves as a  tremendous help to the story teller, but I detect in it deep insights into  the human condition that could be used as the foundations for new models of  psychology and philosophy. This man is deep, yet so plain speaking, the  book reads very smoothly.  My copy is marked up with tons of  notes,  underlines and asterisks in the columns. It's one book I know  I will be  referring back to again and again.  I bought it with the hopes of  moving past a plateau I had reached on a novel I started 10 years ago. As I  read on, page after page, chapter after chapter I kept saying to myself  &quot;Omigod,&quot; as his observations and rules led me to new insights  into how to improve my story, my characters, my scenes, settings, and so  much more. By the time I'd finished the book I knew I could finish my  story. I don't have the story climax yet, but I know, that by using his  techniques, it will come to me. And I know that my story, which already  passed his most important test, is 1000% better.	1999-05-20

I can't get over how many times, since I've read this book, I've looked at the news, at events in my life, from a different perspective. Thom Hartmann's book is disturbing but it gets us thinking about the effects of  our actions and that makes it essential reading. After reading his other  incredible book, Prophet's way, and having it change my life, I really  didn't think his next book could have such a profound effect on me. But it  did, in a more subtle, yet very positive way. Thom Hartmann should run for  president. But he's too smart to even think about it.<br />Thom has been a  speaker at the Winter Brain COnference ([...])  I organize for the past four years. Each year, though he is not a brain  scientist, his lectures draw some of the biggest crowds, because he has a  magical way of integrating the newwest research and his own unique  eco-spiritual-anthropological approach to looking at the world and the  evolution of science and knowledge.	1999-05-03

I purchased this  precious compendium of wisdom  expecting to find some interesting Native American quotations to add to my 400+ collection of quotation books. I discovered an inspirationial book which deftly interweaves philosophy, ecology, history, anthropology and spirituality.  Actually, it is a first hand account of the eradication of the American Indian culture and  extermination of their peoples spoken by the  tribal leaders. Yet it is uplifting and inspiring, not desolating. Page after page I found my heart glowing, or chills running up my back, as I was touched by the pure, noble,  plain  yet profound talk of these great yet simple men-- Seattle, Tecumseh,  Black Hawk, Geronimo and lesser known chiefs of Choctaw, Nez Perce, Yuma, Hopi, Chickasaw, Sioux, and Cree  nations.  They, with great nobility and anguish, speak the  case for their simple way of life, embracing nature and sharing its bounties with all their equal partners-- the buffalo, eagle, bear, trees, wind, earth and sky, all part of the great spirit.<br />The archive photos alone are worth the bargain price of this treasure.	1997-10-14
