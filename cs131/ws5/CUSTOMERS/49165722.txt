US	49165722	R26ZLLUTF51WRH	0060760958	545091711	Dear Senator: A Memoir by the Daughter of Strom Thurmond	Books	3	13	15	N	N	The Hidden Side of Strom Thurmond	For those who are unaware, Strom Thurmond was an important and notorious politician from South Carolina.  Thurmond was Governor of South Carolina during the 1940's.  He than ran as a third-party candidate for President mostly to protest the platform of the Democratic party under President Harry Truman which was calling for an end to segregation and discrimination against African American people.  After losing the presidential race, Thurmond went onto to serve as United States Senator from South Carolina for decades.  He finally retired in 2003 and died shortly thereafter at the age of 100. <br /> <br />This story, though, is not really about Thurmond. Its about Essie Mae Washington, a daughter that Thurmond--the notorious segregationist--fathered with his African American maid.  When Thurmond was 25 and unmarried, he apparently had an affair with his maid and she became pregnant.   <br /> <br />Thurmond saw to it that Essie Mae was well taken care of both financially and in terms of family support.  However, he kept his distance from her, so that no one could ever accuse him of being her father. In fact, during her growing up years, she lived far away from South Carolina in Pennsyvlania. The whole story was a huge secret that was successfully kept from all, but a handful of people close to Essie Mae and to Strom Thurmond. <br /> <br />Most people who read the book will focus on Thurmond's motives.  Did he really care about Essie Mae and love her as his daughter?  Or did his actions simply represent an attempt to buy Essie Mae's silence and atone for feelings of guilt?  The answer isn't really clear.  Perhaps, the real truth lies somewhere between both statements. <br /> <br />In any event, this is Essie Mae's story.  She acknowledges the pro-segregation and often racist positions he took in public life.  Yet, she still looks for the good in Strom Thurmond. <br />Its an interesting book.  Further, its told from a vantage point that I would never have imagined, untilI learned of this story. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-09-20

Neiberg essentially chronicles the war from the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand in August 1914 until the Germans signed the armistice at Compiegne, France in autumn of 1918. <br /> <br />Neiberg dealt with all the important issues in the war.  He explained why all the nations joined in and why they took the respective sides in the conflict that they did.  He explains how the war turned into a stalemate for most of the four years it was fought.  He explains the collapse of Russia.  He does a good job explaining how unrestricted submarine warfare caused the USA to join on the side of the allies.  Finally, explains what lead to the collapse of the German army and the subsequent armistice. <br /> <br />What Neiberg doesn't really attempt to do is zero in on the causes of the war.  Of course, judging from the title of the book, I don't think that is what he intended to do.  It is critical though for people looking in on this incredibly bloody period of history to ask \\"why\\".  The balance of power that existed in Europe, secret treaties, and the lack of an international body to mediate disputes are all factors Neiberg could have written about in detail if this had been within the scope of his book. <br /> <br />Its a good book for those who are simply interested in chronically the events during the war years.  Its not a good work for someone looking for a very analytical book explaining the causes of the war.	2005-09-20

Those who have previously read his books such as \\"John Adams\\" know what a talent McCullough has for taking dry historical facts and information and working them into an exciting and smooth-flowing narrative. <br /> <br />This book begins with King George III addressing the British Parliament in 1775.  He declares the American colonies to be in a state of rebellion and makes it clear it is his intention to use military force to put down the rebellion.  When this statement was received weeks later in the colonies it helped create a momentum of its own.  Some people in the colonies up until that point had sought reconciliation with the king.  It was the realization that King George III had no intention of giving into to any of the demands of the colonies for self-rule and autonomy that pushed many over the edge to seeking independence. <br /> <br />McCullough devotes extremely little attention in the book to the Declaration of Independence or the meetings of the men who wrote and ratified it.  Its clear this was done on purpose.  McCullough was trying to make a critical point.  All the brilliant writing and speeches that surrounded the Declaration of Independence would have meant nothing if America could not militarily defeat or, at least, hold its own with the British Army. <br /> <br />What we see in 1776 is a great \\"see-saw\\".  General Washington and his forces obtain cannons at Fort Ticonderoga that they ship overland and use to lay siege to the British Army occupying the city of Boston.  This is ultimately successful and the British are forced to leave Boston by sea.  This victory is short-lived though. A couple of months later, the British receive reinforcements and mount an invasion of New York.  Washington has a great historical reputation.  However, his command of the American forces during the New York campaign was a weak moment in his career.  He failed to grasp the factthat the British were certain to defeat his army which was inferior in numbers and training.  It is clear he should not have attempted to defend New York.  In any event he did, and the results were disastrous.  The British defeated him in 4 battles capturing or killing about 5000 soldiers.  The Continental Army was almost destroyed in this fighting.   <br /> <br />However, just when the cause of independence seemed to be lost, Washington saw an opportunity to attack the British and Hessian forces at Trenton, New Jersey.  This attack took place during Christmas of 1776.  The enemy was totally unprepared and this time it was Washington's forces that killed and captured large numbers of the enemy. <br /> <br />The war was not won in 1776, but it easily could have been lost.  The fact that it was not is a tribute to those soldiers who stayed with Washington despite his indecisiveness and at times, blundering.  Life is a learning experience for everyone, and Washington himself had to learn about military command as he went along.  Fortunately, he could learn from mistakes and became more skillful. <br /> <br />This is one of the best historical books of the year.  It would be a mistake to not read it. <br />	2005-08-04

It takes up the dilemma that democrats face in 21st century.  That dilemma involves dealing with middle and working class people who formerly considered themselves democrats, but have left the party because of opposition to abortion, gay rights, or one of the other so-called \\"social issues\\".  Unless the party can find a way to persuade some of these voters to rejoin its ranks than republicans may hold the presidency and congress for years to come. <br /> <br />The situation in Kansas is illustrative of what has occurred.  Some of the poorest counties in the state vote more consistently for conservative republican candidates than the wealthiest areas do.  Its exactly the reverse of a trend that began in the 1930's with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the \\"New Deal\\". In those days, the poor voted virtually unanimously for democrats and the wealthy were nearly as unanimous in their support of republican candidates. <br /> <br />What exactly has happened?  My major criticism of Franks' book is that he is long on description (often in very hyperbolic manner), but short on explanation.  Franks suggests at one point that the democrats have shown less and less interest in economic issues in the last 15 years and as a result, working class and lower middle class supporters increasingly cannot see the difference between them and the republicans.  Perhaps, its true the democrats under Clinton supported NAFTA and other free trade agreements which may have caused the loss of some jobs in America's heartland. <br /> <br />Its not a bad book, but it could have been shorter.  Franks made his essential points in two or three chapters and the rest is pretty repetitious. <br /> <br />	2005-08-04

Tom Friedman's book \\"The World is Flat\\" should be required reading for every politician and public servant.  This is particularly true of those who have to deal with trade, economics, education, and funding for scientific research. <br /> <br />Those who read Friedman's prior book about globalization \\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\\" will be most familiar with Friedman's basic views.  Essentially, Friedman has been arguing for years that America is embroiled in a huge global competition.  Our most threatening competitors are not in Europe or in what we recognize as the \\"Developed World\\".  Rather, our most frigntening competition is coming from places like China and India.  We tend to view these societies as primitive and undeveloped.  Friedman explains just how far these countries have come in the last fifteen years and it is amazing.  India may become the new Silicon Valley with companies like Infosys that are competing far more cheaply and aggressively with Microsoft and other American companies than we imagine. Few Americans realize that many services in the USA such as income tax preparation, review of x-rays, and even some journalism are already being outsourced to India and we don't even know it. <br /> <br />Friedman argues that the USA does not need to fear a world with no trade barriers and unrestricted competition as long as we realize what is going on and prepare for it.  As a nation, the USA needs to invest far more in education and science than we currently do.  We need to train far more engineers and scientists than we have been. If we can't do this, at least we need to allow foreigners with this training to immigrate more freely to our nation.  We also need to learn to focus on what we do best in America which is innovate and come up with new ideas.  An economic strategy founded simply on manufacturing will no longer work in America.  This type of work can be sent abroad and done much more cheaply. <br /> <br />Friedman believes there is much positive about America.  For example, no nation has the number of colleges and universities we do that turn out highly-trained, literate people and serve as ideal places for research.  Also, for the most part our legal system allows for prompt business formation, the enforcement of contracts, the hiring and firing of employees, and the collection of debts.  However, what we forget is that people in China, India, and the rest of the developing world are very eager to live the way we do and are willing to go to extraordinary lengths to improve their standard of living. <br /> <br />There is ancient Chinese proverb that says \\"May you live in interesting times\\". Based on what Friedman says is happening we and are children are certain to live in interesting times.  The real question though is will we maintain the quality standard of life that Americans have taken for granted for so long. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-04

Conservatives in the GOP	Christine Todd Whitman must not have been very happy serving as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush Administration.  Its very clear that her politics are considerably different from George W. Bush and his closest supporters. <br /> <br />Christine Whitman is part of a vanishing breed.  She is one of the few people who are still willing to use the label \\"moderate republican\\".  She is pro-choice when it comes to abortion and gay rights. She supports affirmative action within limits. She is critical of George W. Bush's decision to invade and occupy Iraq--at least while the situation in Afghanistan has yet to be fully resolved.  Lest anyone believe she is really a \\"liberal\\" or RINO (Republican In Name Only) she makes it clear she favors a limited role for government in the economy, lower taxes, cutbacks in government spending, and a strong national defense. She is quick to extol the accomplishments of republicans.  She reminds us its Theodore Roosevelt who pushed America towards conservation of national resources.  She recalls it was President Nixon who was in charge when the EPA was created. <br /> <br />The main point of her book is that moderates in the GOP have taken a \\"backseat\\" to conservatives for too long.  One mystery that she does not attempt to explain is why moderates have allowed this to happen?  Are they afraid that it might split the party and cost an election? Is there really less disagreement between republican moderates and conservatives than Whitman claims?  I found myself unable to let go of these questions. <br /> <br />Its clear that she would like to see groups of moderate republicans organize and try to take back control of the GOP. She is very uncomfortable with the party's focus on the \\"social issues\\". Perhaps, what she overlooks is that GOP party leadership sees issues like abortion, gay rights, and gun control as more successful \\"vote getters\\" than support for less government regulation of business, or lower tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. That maybe sad, but its probably a reality. This is what I believe is pushing the GOP \\"far right\\" on the conservative spectrum. <br /> <br />Its interesting reading and I too would like to see the GOP focus more on traditional issues. Hopefully, the book will help others feel the same way. <br /> <br />	2005-05-23

Joe Ellis has written another book on par with American Sphinx (his Jefferson biography) and Founding Brothers (history of the events and men who created the Constitution).  Ellis's best feature is ability to condense great amounts of historical material and reduce it to an interesting and managably sized book that gets across certain major points. <br /> <br />Ellis answers questions that I hadn't known the answers too.  Here are a few he deals with: <br /> <br />1. When and why did Washington become convinced a Revolution against Britain was necessary? <br /> <br />2. Why was Washington picked to head the Continental Army. <br /> <br />3. Why did Washington join with the federalists and support a stronger federal government than the one created by the Articles of Confederation? <br /> <br />4. What did Washington think of his contemporaries such as Hamilton and Jefferson? <br /> <br />5. Why did Washington free his slaves in his will? <br /> <br />Its an insightful book and some of the things one learns are quite a surprise.  One example is the fact that colonial forces almost lost the Revolutionary War and were on the verge of being defeated almost up until the time of Washington's victory over General Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781. Washington was quite conscious during his life he would be a very famous man after his death and took many actions to protect his historical reputation.  Washington deliberately said and wrote little because he felt he could lead more by appearing to be neutral and non-committed on many issues. <br /> <br />This is not a detailed comprehensive biography.  Its a medium length book designed to hold the reader's interest and educate him/her about a number of significant historical points.  A good choice to get a good overview of George Washington and his most significant accomplishments. <br /> <br />	2004-11-18
US	49165722	R3QCX0IJBP5FGJ	1594200092	686377339	Alexander Hamilton	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Alexander Hamilton:  Patriot and Genius	Ron Chernow's book \\"Alexander Hamilton\\" is an excellent portrait of the first man to become Secretary of the Treasury of the United States.  Hamilton's story is unique and different from most of the founding fathers. <br /> <br />He began life in a very humble manner.  He was born on St. Kitts island in the West Indies to two parents who were not legally married to one another.  Unfortunately for Hamilton this fact resulted in him being labelled in his latter years as a \\"bastard\\" and his illegitimacy sadly was actually used against him. Hamilton was not born to wealth and started out as a clerk in a shop on the island of St. Croix.  Others around him quickly recognized his talents and gave him financing to travel to the colony of New York and obtain an education. <br /> <br />Hamilton arrived in America at the beginning of the American Revolution.  He was intelligent and charismatic enough to organize a group of soldiers to fight for the Revolutionary cause.  After a few skirmishes, his ability received rapid recognition and he was asked to serve on George Washington's staff.  Hamilton became so effective in this role that Washington did not want to do without him.  When Hamilton sought to leave the staff to take an actual combat command near the end of the Revolutionary War, Washington tried to stop him.  Hamilton left anyway, and commanded a group of soldiers that helped defeat the British and win the battle of Yorktown. <br /> <br />Hamilton practiced law in New York in the period after the war and prior to the framing of the Constitution.  He was quick to realize what an ineffective government the Articles of Confederation had left America with.  He served in the delegation to the Constitutional Convention.  The famous book the \\"Federalist Papers\\" is a compendium of essays written by himself, James Madison, and a couple of the other founding fathers that presented arguments urging ratification of the new Constitution.  These writings undoubtedly persuaded many states to ratify the Constitution between 1787-1789. <br /> <br />After Washington's election as President in 1789, Hamilton was asked to serve as Secretary of the Treasury.  His achievements in this office were prodigious.  He created a national bank. He created a system for assuming debts from the war that helped put the United States on a sound economic footing and restored our nation's credit abroad. He created a customs service.  He created the US Coast Guard.  He participated in the creation of lighthouses and navigation systems, realizing what a boon this would be to overseas trade.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, political factions formed as soon as Washington was elected President.  Hamilton became identified as a \\"federalist\\" (one who sought broad powers for national government)  Others such as Jefferson and Madison became \\"anti-federalists\\" and opposed a powerful federal government.  The political fighting between Hamilton, Jefferson and Madison was extreme.  Sadly, all these individuals sullied themselves by their pettiness and nasty bickering.  I admit that after reading the book that while I admire the founding fathers for their achievements, I felt that their squabbling and fighting was on such a level that it seriously detracted from their overall importance and reputation. <br /> <br />After Hamilton left the Treasury department in the mid-1790's his stellar achievements had been reached.  Sadly, he seems to have spent most of the rest of his life arguing and quarreling.  Hamilton had spent much of his time battling with Thomas Jefferson.  Yet, when he saw the possibility that Aaron Burr (another New Yorker) might be elected President in 1800, he suddenly put all his contempt for Jefferson aside and supported his election over Burr.  Later, when Burr ran for Governor of New York, Hamilton went out of his way to attack Burr and prevent his election.  This lead Burr to challenge Hamilton to a duel and Hamilton was killed.  Readers of this book cannot help but be amazed at how a brilliant man like Hamilton could have exercised such chronic bad judgment and spent so much of his time in petty political fights.  Its sad, but it is the truth. <br /> <br />Chernow has written a great book.  He includes so much material, though, that it is hard to get through at times.  I don't recommend anyone read this quickly.  Too material will simply get past you. The major weakness of the book is that Chernow is obviously a great admirer of Hamilton and occasionally blinds himself to his faults.  Chernow seems to discount Jefferson's criticism of Hamilton that he was a \\"monarchist\\" at heart.  Its hard to say for certain. It is clear that Hamilton viewed common citizens poorly and supported a form of government where they made very few decisions themselves.  On at least one occasion, Hamilton publicly stated he thought the president should serve for life, once elected. <br /> <br />Anyone who likes to read about early American history simply should not miss Chernow's book.	2004-10-14

Meacham tells the story not of a person, or of an historical event, but instead he tells the story of one of the most important relationships that ever existed between two men.<br />Few relationships have ever had the importance that this particular one did. It is difficult to imagine a more critical relationship than the one between the two heads of state of countries fighting Nazi Germany in World War II. Because FDR and Churchill trusted one another and communicated well with one another America and Britain were able to avoid many pitfalls that nations which join together in temporary alliances often encounter.<br />Churchill and Roosevelt had many similarities and some major differences.  However, both realized at the outset of World War II--after Churchill became Prime Minister of Britain--that for the good of both their nations they must work closely together to defeat Nazi Germany.  This was easier said than done at times. Churchill had a number of personal habits which irritated Roosevelt.  For example, Churchill was often long and rambling in his conversations.  Churchill, the ultimate Anglophile, refused to see certain larger implications of World War II, such as the end of British Colonialism.  Churchill sometimes would barge into Roosevelt's bedroom in the Whitehouse in the middle of the night--when he visited the President--simply to talk about some idea that had suddenly crossed his mind.<br />On the other hand, Roosevelt sometimes annoyed Churchill.  Roosevelt insisted at both the Teheran and Yalta conferences upon meeting first with Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator, before talking to Churchill.  This lead Churchill to feel both annoyed and less important than the other two men.  Roosevelt was sometimes both secretive and non-committal, a trait Churchill found to be extremely frustrating at times.<br />What was impressive wasthe willingness of both men had to set aside differences, ignore personality quirks, reject stereotypes, and work together for the common good of both their nations.  In a day when public discourse between political figures is often marked by rancor and unwillingness to compromise, it is refreshing to know that some great men can put aside personal differences to reach a larger goal.	2004-01-29

Clark does a good job of keeping his work concise and on-point. <br />Clark begins the book by giving an excellent recitation of the background and actually fighting that occurred in the 2003 Iraq War.  Clark also describes the post-war difficulties that America has experienced there since and he discusses how the Iraq effort may have impeded US policy in other countries.<br />He faults the Bush Administration for failing to consider other alternatives to the war such as continuing with arms inspections and the embargo.  He believes that even if war were necessary that the Bush Administration should have made more of an effort to seek United Nations approval and participation in the conflict. Lastly, he faults the Bush Administration for not having a better plan in place to police Iraq during the post-invasion phase of the operation. Clark does state, though, that it would be a big mistake for the US to pull out of Iraq at this point.  Whatever happens--now that we have occupied the country--we must see the occupation through to a positive ending.<br />Clark believes that failure to enlist more support from the international community before invading Iraq has harmed US interests in many ways:  1. Its detracted from the resources we have available to assist the pro-western government we installed in Afghanistan; 2. It destroyed much of the sympathy the US received from foreign countries following the attack by terrorists on 9/11;  3. It has strained our armed forces which are trying to get out a number of difficult missions around the globe with limited regular and reserve forces; 4. The cost of the war has limited the amount of money our government has to pursue homeland security needs within the US.<br />The book is a solid matter-of-fact account about the Iraq War.  It should give Americans who read it alot of food for thought about the direction their country has taken.	2004-01-21

It is clear though, that instead of intending this to be a biography, it is Rubin's attempt to explain to the general public the challenges posed by globalization and the post-Cold War economic system.<br />During Rubin's tenure as Secretary of the Treasury the Administration dealt with two major economic crises in foreign nations.  The first involved Mexico.  The Mexican government borrowed too much money abroad and attempted to pacify creditors with payments that would be tied to the US dollar to avoid fluctuation.  Unfortunately, the debts were so huge Mexico simply lacked the currency reserves to make these payments.  When this became apparent, the Peso, their currency dropped dramatically in value.  Mexico was on the verge of defaulting on its foreign debts. Despite heavy criticism and and initial public unpopularity, the US put together an aid package that kept Mexico from defaulting on its foreign debts and possibly precipitating a regional default on debts by other Latin American countries.<br />The real test for Rubin and other government officials came later in 1997 and 1998 as economic problems developed in Asia. Fixed exchange rates for currency, high import/export ratios and huge foreign debts caused investors to pull huge amounts of capital out of these nations in a short time. Bail out packages involving both the US and the International Monetary Fund had to be put together for Thailand, Korea, and Indonesia.  Rubin strongly feels that such bailouts are occasionally necessary simply because the self interest of the US and other modern industrialized countries requires it.  Rubin describes the circumstances in which bailouts should occur.  He ultimately focuses on whether the country being helped is willing to undertake internal economic reforms to prevent similar problems in the future.  If so, generally speaking, a financial bailout may be warranted.  Rubin praises those who worked with him, Larry Summers, and, of course, the esteemed head of the Federal Reserve System, Alan Greenspan.<br />Rubin's description of his years at the Treasury Department are highly interesting.  Those outside government may be unaware the Secretary of the Treasury manages such diverse areas as tax collection (Internal Revenue Service), trade and tariff policy, printing the currency (Bureau of Printing and Engraving), and Secret Service (protection of the President).  Its a challenging job and perhaps partisan politics is not the best way to pick the head of such a complex organization.<br />Finally, Rubin worries openly in the book about current government policies.  He believes long term deficit reduction is the best guarantee of low interest rates and a growing economy. This can only be obtained by a combination of disciplined spending by Congress and sufficient taxes to decrease the deficit.  Rubin sees an unwillingness by Congress to raise taxes even when it would be in the best long-term interest of the economy. <br />Anyone interested in current affairs simply should not miss this book.	2004-01-19

Gerry Spence is not only a famous trial lawyer.  He's a terrific author.  He's written a number of books that are well worth reading. Some of his books concern individual cases he was involved in.  Others deal generally with his philosophy of justice and government.  Some of my favorites include:  Gunning for Justice; Of Murder and Madness; and the Making of a Country Lawyer.<br />&quot;The Smoking Gun&quot; concerns a homicide which occurred in Oregon in the mid-1980's.  Sandy Jones and her son confronted a real estate developer,Wilfred Gertula, and his wife over trespassing on their land.  Sandy and her son had loaded rifles and an altercation began.  During the altercation, Wilfred Gertula was shot and killed.  Sandy and her son were charged with murder.  The only problem was they hadn't shot Mr. Gertula.  Forensic tests proved that Mr. Gertula was likely shot by a handgun, not a rifle, and the person firing the gun was almost certainly his wife, Monica Gertula.  Polygraph tests showed that when Monica claimed she hadn't fired a weapon at the crime scene, she almost certainly was not telling the truth.  Later, a witness came forward to indicate that the Gertulas' almost always kept a loaded handgun in the glove compartment of the vehicle they were riding in at the time of the homicide.<br />The amazing part of the story is the difficulty that Spence has despite these facts in freeing Sandy Jones and her son. The prosecutors conceal evidence, refuse to dismiss the case, refuse to agree that Sandy should be allowed release on bail, and generally bring the full power of the state down on someone who they either know/or should know never committed the crime with which she is charged.  The lack of integrity by the prosecution is virtually a scandal.<br />To be fair, I don't think Spence does emphasize enough Sandy Jones'role in the homicide.  She may not have fired the gun that killed Wilfred Gertula, but her actions--in brandishing and firing a loaded gun--may have been what caused Monica Gertula to fire her weapon and accidentally kill her husband.  Spence is faithful to his role as advocate for his client and doesn't see her responsibility for any of the events.<br />Nevertheless, the book is an interesting story and its a timely reminder that the awesome power of the state can be used to ruin the lives of innocent and helpless people.  The role of the criminal defense attorney is an essential, if unpopular one, in a free society.	2003-12-02

The entire book deals with Ike's relationships with other important military and political leaders.  John Eisenhower says he wrote the book primarily to correct misapprehensions and mistakes that other writers have made in discussing Ike.<br />The reader will meet people who we never knew existed such as General Fox Conner, a competent and decent army officer who early on recognized Ike's leadership potential and did his best to promote his career.  We will learn about Ike's complicated relationships with famous persons such as Douglas MacArthur, John &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing, and the French General Charles DeGaulle.  Ike apparently held DeGaulle in great personal regard and put him on a list of the five most important men he knew.<br />Ike's wartime relationship with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill deserves special mention.  Early on Churchill understood how critical Anglo-American cooperation was to a successful outcome in World War II.  As such, he bent over backwards to see that Eisenhower and the Americans were given first-class treatment by the English.  Eisenhower had much regular contact with Churchill and it struck me that he was closer to him than President Roosevelt and other American political figures.<br />One of the most interesting sections of the book recounts Ike's dilemma in dealing with British Army General Sir Bernard Montgomery.  Montgomery believed that he alone had the strategy which could have forced an earlier end to World War II.  He constantly feuded with Eisenhower over strategy and supplies. At one time, Eisenhower came close to asking the British to place someone else in command, but than things were smoothed out. The problems did not end even after the war was over.  Years later, Montgomery wrote his own memoirs criticizing Eisenhower's conduct of the European campaign after D-day.  A normallypatient man, Ike was infuriated with Montgomery.<br />This is a good book for students of World War II history and those who believe that history is determined more by individuals than by events.	2003-09-16
US	49165722	R3AQJ8SEBOKK5Y	0684807610	438783610	Benjamin Franklin: An American Life	Books	4	37	40	N	N	The Soul of America	Benjamin Franklin typified the soul or virtues that most of us Americans hold dear.  He rose from being a poor boy to becoming wealthy and distinguished in many fields.  He extolled the virtues of the middle class, merchants, and business people over the nobility and titled gentry of Europe.  He courageously called for the independence of America when many people still wanted to retain a loyalty to Great Britain.  Putting on another hat, he successfully negotiated with first France and than Britain during the Revolutionary War to gain America's independence.  Franklin was a successful writer and printer, an inventor, a civic-minded citizen, and a statesman.<br />Walter Isaacson's book is successful in portraying the wide diversity of Franklin's efforts and achievements. He also delves into Franklin's personal life which included beliefs in Deism as opposed to traditional Christianity.  Franklin fathered a child out of wedlock and Isaacson explains how despite this Franklin took responsibility for his actions and did his best to raise this son.<br />Nevertheless, Isaacson's book is not free from criticism.  It is not as interesting or well written as other books about this same period of history.  For example, \\"John Adams\\" by David McCullough is far more captivating.  \\"American Sphinx\\" by Joe Ellis is another book that does a good job of keeping the attention of a novice reading about the founding fathers.  Finally, \\"Thomas Jefferson: an Intimate History\\" by Fawn Brodie is another fascinating account of the men who made America.  One gets the idea Isaacson is so determined to cram our heads with details that the book loses some of its allure.<br />Books like these remind us that the founding fathers were human beings with faults and not deities.  Depending on how harsh a critic one is, one could argue Franklin had few friends because he was not loyal to them.  One could contend he mistreated his wife leaving her for years by herself in America while he carried on inGreat Britain arguing over various colonial issues. One could say he treated his son William, unduly harshly, because he chose to side with the British instead of those in America seeking independence.  One could also argue Franklin was a poor team player as a diplomat and couldn't get along with either John Adams or Mr. Lee who were also appointed to negotiate with the French.<br />However, on the balance it is clear Franklin's virtues far outweighed his faults.  This is an authoritative book about one of the most significant Americans who has ever lived.	2003-07-15

Those who struggled to make it through Bernard Lewis's book \\"What Went Wrong\\" can take consolation in the fact that \\"The Crisis of Islam\\" is better written and easier to understand. This book is a very reasonable and scholarly attempt to explain the following:<br />1. Differences between Western and Islamic countries;<BR>2. How these differences have resulted in economic and political difficulties for Islamic countries;<BR>3. Finally, how these difficulties gave rise to Islamic Fundamentalism and terrorism against the West.<br />Lewis spends some time in the beginning chapters of the book in explaining the concept of Jihad (or holy war) and what it means and what it does not.  He explains the interpretation and mis-interpretation of Koranic verses by some Muslims  He deals with the importance of the Crusades to Muslims (it represents the last time they had a victory against the West.  Finally, he highlights some differences in Islamic Western societies that lead to the West gaining economic superiority.<br />The book really comes alive in the last few chapters as Lewis sets the stage for terrorism and movements like Al Quaida.  He does this by describing the image many Muslims have of the West as immoral, he discusses the weak state of economies in virtually every Islamic country, and he discusses how the West has supported tyrannical regimes for long periods of time in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran under the Shah, and Saddam Hussein--when he was making war on Iran.<br />It is important for people in Western countries to recognize that terrorist groups do not represent all Muslims.  Terrorist groups do frightening things, but represent numerically small groups.  Many Muslims completely disagree with how the terrorist groups interpret the Koran.  For example, terrorists endorse suicide bombers.  Most Muslims would tell you that anyone who commits suicide in their religion is certain to go to hell.<br />What I sense from what Lewis says in this book is the problemis largely a problem of these societies. Although, we can and should temper our support for those countries run by unpopular despots.  Other than this, there is not alot the West can do other than combat terrorism when it occurs.  Its up to these countries to recognize they have problems and attempt to fix them from within.	2003-07-06

Nome had no road connections with inland Alaskan cities and towns.  It had no rail connection.  During summer months ships arrived in Nome carrying passengers and freight.  However, in the winter this became impossible as the ocean water in the Bering Strait turned into ice.  The medical establishment in Nome had only a small outdated supply diptheria serum.<br />This book recounts the incredible story of how dogsleds carried diptheria serum 800 miles from Tanana to Nome under the most impossible conditions.  The tempatures were often 50 degrees below zero (or lower).  Oftentimes, windchill made this even worse. Despite the horrendous conditions the dogs and their drivers persevered and carried enough diptheria serum to Nome to stop the epidemic from spredding.<br />This is an incredible tale of people faced with a catastrophe who respond by giving 110% effort to solve the problem.  The dogsled drivers are the true heroes in this story and we get a chance to learn about them and their dogs. Anyone who is fascinated by man's attempts to battle harsh environmental conditions and harsh weather will love this book.	2003-06-23
US	49165722	R20YXGW4PMKUZC	1560851511	366912220	American Apocrypha: Essays on the Book of Mormon (Essays on Mormonism Series)	Books	3	25	35	N	N	The Book of Mormon--Revisited	The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days (Mormons) teaches its members that if they want to know whether the Book of Mormon is true or not they should pray about the matter.  If they receive a &quot;burning in their bosom&quot; they will know that the book and the accounts depicted inside are accurate. For faithful members of the church this is the only way to discover the &quot;truth&quot; of the Book of Mormon.<br />Brent Metcalfe and Dan Vogel take a different approach.  They present a number of articles from scholars who have attempted to get at &quot;the truth&quot; of the Book of Mormon in a totally different manner.  They apply the tools of the scientific method, historical research, and logical analysis to formulate hypotheses and draw conclusions. As a result, people who use logic and science to resolve issues are likely to be impressed by this book.  On the other hand, those who believe in a religion purely because of faith and answers they have received in prayer are not likely to be impressed by this work, or to want to read it for that matter.<br />The articles are quite interesting.  My favorite three included the one on &quot;automatic writing&quot;, Tom Murphy's article on DNA and the Lamanites (which he came close to being excommunicated for writing), and the article on former &quot;Seventy&quot; B.H. Roberts and what he really believed about the Book of Mormon.<br />What comes through to the educated person is that many things that have long been presented &quot;as facts&quot; by the church are not.  The truth is far more complicated.  One can read the Book of Mormon and conclude that Nephites and Lamanites were supposedly the only groups present in the Americas between 600 BC and 400 AD. However, DNA testing shows this is simply impossible.  The vast, vast bulk of Native Americans are related to groups in Asia that crossed the Bering Straits into this continent 10,000 to 50,000 years ago.  In fact, its virtually impossible to find any connectionbetween Native Americans and either Jews or Egyptians as claimed in the Book of Mormon. <br />The article on automatic writing challenges the allegation that it would be impossible for one uneducated person to &quot;invent&quot; or &quot;write&quot; the Book of Mormon by himself.  In fact, such things have been documented to have been done several times in the past and perhaps on a more impressive scale.<br />This is a good book for a scholarly person who has questions about Mormon doctrine and seeks an answer that is not &quot;faith-based&quot;.  Whether all the writers have arrived at the correct conclusions or not, it does stimulate alot of powerful thinking.	2003-06-03
US	49165722	R2BIUHM2I9LFY5	0385489129	752867547	My Losing Season	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Pat Conroy, Basketball, and a Few Other Things	Pat Conroy has succeeded in writing his most painfully honest book yet.  \\"My Losing Season\\" deals primarily with Conroy's senior year of basketball playing at the Citadel (1966-67.  However, before we get to that point, Conroy discusses much of his childhood and younger years that lead up to this point.<br />This is not a book for those who cannot stand to read about the physical and psychological abuse of a child by a parent. Unlike \\"The Great Santini\\" where Conroy uses a work of fiction to write about his father--as well as giving him a few redeeming qualities--Conroy details the abuse and domestic violence his father inflicted on his family.  Its hard to stomach the recitation of this abuse at times.  One wishes someone would have intervened and forced his father into therapy and treatment.<br />Conroy writes again about life at the Citadel.  Life as a plebe was very hard and at one time Conroy called his mother to complain.  She asked \\"how bad is it\\".  Conroy's response was \\"Mom, its worse than Dad\\".  Those unfamiliar with hazing rituals at some institutions may have trouble relating to deliberate sleep deprivation, humiliation, and use of food deprivation as tools to destroy the spirit of human beings.<br />Most of the book details individual games played by the team this year as they developed a losing playing record.  My sense was not that the Citadel had a bad team, but simply that it was playing more highly skilled teams.  One point Conroy made was that recruitment of basketball players at the Citadel was made hard by the fact that many elected to go to school at non-military institutions without hazing rituals.  <br />At the end of the book, Conroy followed up with many of his teammates.  A number--like he--had been quite successful, making most of their careers in business and industry.<br />My only significant criticism of the book is that at times Conroy chooses to undertake a sort of out-of-place introspection. He criticizes himself for his two failedmarriages.   He blames this on the fact he had an inner need to \\"rescue women in distress\\".  In another point in the book he makes another out-of-place comment about feeling bad he didn't serve America in the military in Vietnam (he would have still protested the war, but would have done so when his service ended)<br />All in all, its a good book. I'd have been happier though if Conroy had focused on his childhood, The Citadel, and the basketball teams games that year.	2003-05-26

Like any book that is under 200 pages, you can't claim it to be an authoritative or complete source.<br />Esposito does do a fine job of figuring out what (I think) most people would want to know and than furnishing concise, easy to read answers.  We learn what the five pillars of the Islamic faith are.  We learn what the Muslim people believe about Christ, the Old Testament, the New Testament and how they believe Muhammad received God's last revelation.  We learn about the Black Muslim movement in the USA fits into Islam and its interesting.  We learn what Jihad, or \\"holy war\\" really is and how the concept has been interpreted and misinterepreted by different groups.  <br />At times, I felt Esposito perhaps downplayed negative aspects in Islam.  He does attempt to explain why some Muslims hate America and the West.  However, this lacked the depth that one would hope for.   Also, some Medieval aspects of Islam culture such as countries that practice stoning for adultery and amputation for thievery don't get the criticism they should. <br />The great feature of this book is that you can learn a lot in a short time because of its size and the amount of information contained within it.  Those interested in this subject should get a copy.	2003-04-11

Shirer meticulously researched his account. Its not short, and someone who doesn't want to take the time to get a thorough account should settle for something else.<br />Shirer covers the rise of Naziis and explains the conditions that brought them to power.  The post-war chaos from World War I had an awful effect on Germany.  Although, Shirer disputes some things that are commonly spouted.  For instance, he disputes that the boundaries given to Germany by the treaty of Versailles (following WWI) were inadequate.  He also disputes that the entire treaty was as unfair as many Germans claimed it to be.<br />That a rag-tag group like the Naziis could become a major political party and eventually win control of the German government is testimony to the despair that can be created by an economic depression, human stupidity/gullibility, and the effect propaganda can have.  One must assign a good part of the blame for the rise of Hitler to the German upper classes and the German professional classes.  Most of these people did not initially support Hitler, but they went along and did nothing to stop him.<br />Some of the chapters in the book really stand out.  The chapter on the \\"Battle of Britain\\" is fascinating reading.  Its amazing how England--greatly outnumbered-- was able to hold its own against Germany for over a year before other countries joined them in the struggle.  The chapter on the invasion of Russia is interesting reading as well.  That Russia managed to hang on after such a massive assault is a miracle.  The chapter on the death camps called the \\"New Order\\" is a detailed and sickening account of Nazi atrocities against Jews, gypsies, and people of slavic ancestry. If you read it, have a strong stomach.<br />Shirer's book is a one volume way to educate yourself about most of World War II.  Anyone interested in this subject simply cannot pass it up.pass it up.	2003-04-04
US	49165722	R1MAOIOFW4QVD8	0375507248	633811695	Lazy B: Growing Up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest	Books	3	18	20	N	N	Vanishing Way of Life	This is a very pleasant book to read.  Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and her brother Alan Day have written a memoir of growing up on a cattle ranch in the Southwest.  For those who have little idea what is involved in ranching the book is very educational.  Sandra and her brother point out the degree to which their lives revolved around the limited water available.  The ranch contained windwills which often pumped water from depths as deep as 300 to 500 feet into containers for the cattle to drink.  Much ranch work simply involved maintaining and fixing problems with the windwills when they fell into disrepair.  Other jobs with which most non-ranchers have little familiarity include branding cattle, marking their ears, nursing sick animals, rounding up strays, and fixing fences that have fallen down.  Its not the kind of work one sees in big cities and one definitely sees how different a lifestyle ranching is/was.<br />The description of the various cowboys who worked on the ranch was fascinating.  What I found most amazing was that almost all of them lived to very old ages, despite limited health care and working in a dangerous occupation.  One story that stays in my mind is the cowboy who died at age 75, but only because he was thrown from a horse at a rodeo event and broke his neck!<br />Sandra Day O'Connor certainly had a different life than most children.  She spent summers working on her ranch with her family.  The rest of the year she spent living with relatives in El Paso, TX attending primary and secondary school.  It was a life that seemed certain to breed quite a bit of independence. Seeing this, it is not at all hard to imagine Sandra as the first woman U.S. Supreme Court Justice.<br />The authors' book fails only in one sense.  They are highly critical of government regulation by the Bureau of Land Management.  Certainly, public land regulation has been imperfect.  The reality is the USA had no real regulation of grazing or ranching until the 1930's with the passage of the Taylor Grazing Act.  At the time the act was passed, severe overgrazing and depletion of grasslands and pasture on the public domain had occurred.  It is against this background one must understand the need of the BLM to reduce grazing and impose fees prohibitive of grazing in some areas.  The authors repeatedly emphasize how arid the ranch they lived upon was.  It takes years for nature to recover from overgrazing in such conditions.  The Lazy B Ranch may have been run in a highly responsible fashion.  However, even if this was the case it is doubtful many other ranchers exhibited this amount of responsibility.<br />Its an interesting book about ranching, family, and growing up.  For someone who doesn't want anything deep, but something down to earth, I recommend it.	2003-01-06

Unfortunately, this assumption has been shot down by recent events in Illinois where it was learned through DNA testing that at least a dozen of the state's death row inmates were in fact not guilty of the crime with which they were charged.  <br />Scott Turow is from Illinois and I'm certain the recent events in that state provided the \\"catalyst\\" for theme of this book. As usual he stages his characters in the fictional place of Kindle County in Center City.  We briefly bump into a couple of characters who appeared in earlier volumes.  However, this book is about new characters.  There is the Assistant District Attorney who spends as much time sleeping with a detective (who of course obtained the confession from the man on death row)as she does investigating the crime.  There is the brilliant attorney almost 40 years old, divorced, who spends most of his time either carrying for his schitzophrenic sister, or making love to a heroin-addicted former judge. <br />Turow's characters spend more time worrying about getting laid than they do about the innocence or guilt of the pathetic figure, Gandolph, who can barely articulate coherent sentences. Gandolph has been on death row for years for a crime he didn't commit. One is not left with a very appealing portrait of judges, prosecuting attorneys, defense attorneys, or police detectives.  I doubt these people could be this bad in real life.<br />However, the book has two redeeming features.  First, you are kept guessing until the very end about whether Gandolph or someone else really committed the murders.  The second redeeming feature is a bit more complicated.  People really have become complacent about the death penalty in America.  Most don't accept that the system sometimes goes wrong and sentences innocent people to execution. Turow uses the device of the murder mystery to make us think a little bit about this system.  Is it too cavalier?  Do prosecutors sometimes refuse to back down even when substantial evidence of innocence does surface? Are judges more concerned with the mechanics of the system rather than whether an innocent man may lose his life? Do the police go overboard in their efforts to obtain confessions rather than focusing on DNA and other physical evidence of a crime?  How can we protect innocent people without decades of appeals by those sentenced to death?  <br />I can recommend the book based on both redeeming features.	2002-12-26

If there is one truth that should stay with everyone who reads Tom Friedman's book about Globalization it is that this trend is going to go forward no matter what.  Countries and individuals are going to have to learn to adapt and shape themselves to it, otherwise the alternative is they will be run over like a freight train.<br />Globalization is a new system, a new world order, that according to Friedman began about 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War which had been going on since 1945 ended abruptly. In the Cold War Era countries could get away with badly run and inefficient economic systems.  For example, most third world countries could count on foreign aid from either the USA or Soviet Union to buttress up shaky, inefficient economies. Europe and the United States could justify trade barriers and subsidizing inefficient sectors of their economy on the basis that it was necessary to \\"fight the spread of communism\\".  In the past, foreign trade and exports were a much smaller factor in GDP.<br />With the collapse of communism and the birth of the information economy, inefficiency is no longer maintainable in national economies.  People can overseas to other countries to get products that are badly made or too costly.  Companies that make expensive and poor quality goods will be run out of business rapidly.  Computers, the internet, and cell phones make it far easier to locate cheaper sources of goods and to establish trade relationships anywhere on the globe.<br />Some countries which are poorly suited to compete in such an economy are bound to pay dearly.  The Arab world, much of Africa, and parts of South America seemed destined for extremely difficult times in attempting to adapt to such a system.  Other countries such as the USA, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Great Britain and Italy have done and may continue to do surprisingly well.<br />Government must accept a new role in such an economy.  Rather than establishing elaborate welfare schemes, it must take on the role of training workers for jobs in the new economy, eliminating trade barriers, creating the conditions for better competition, and making market information available.<br />It will be a trying time for many, but it cannot be avoided.  It can only be shaped through public awareness.	2002-12-04

Michael Shnayerson and Mark Plotkin have written the latest book documenting the rise of bacterial resistance to antibiotic medications.  Its a very chilling portrait of a problem that still is not being taken as seriously as it should be.  The essence of the problem is very simple.  Bacteria have short lives and reproduce very rapidly.  Because of this, they are able to mutate and develop ways of preventing antibiotics from killing them.  They are much more adaptable than human beings are as a life form.<br />According to the authors, the problem of bacteria resistance to antibiotics is far more serious than is conceived by most people.  Already, hospitals have many patients with VRE's (vancomycin resistant entercoccus) infections and MRSA's (methicillin resistant s. aureus)infections.  Such infections are characterized by being totally resistant to one and sometimes even entire classes of antibiotic medications.  At the extreme, a few infections cannot be cured by even the enormously powerful antibiotic which is only used in hospitals, vancomycin.<br />One problem the authors discuss in some detail is the fact that some resistance to antibiotics by bacteria has been caused by feeding livestock huge quantities of \\"growth enhancing\\" antibiotic-laced feed.  The European Community (beginning with Denmark) took note of this problem and has now prohibited the use of such feed in connection with livestock raising now.  Unfortunately, various lobby groups and government agencies have prevented a similar rule from going into effect in the USA.<br />I don't recommend this book for everyone.  To get much out of it, one must have a basic understanding of life science.  It is helpful to know something about how cells multiply and divide, something about DNA, the difference between gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and how antibiotics actually work.  I recommend that anyone reading the book prepare a glossary containing the meanings of abbreviations constantly used in the volume.  Some of the abbreviations which constantly reoccur include:  VRE, MRSA, VISA, CDC, NIH, CVM, MDR TB, DOTS, and RPR.<BR>It is helpful, but not necessary to have some familiarity with names of bacteria such as salmonella, e. coli, s. aureus, E. faecium, and S. pneumo.<br />There is hope in the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria. Governments, medical providers, and even the public are beginning to realize a problem exists.  New medications to fight such resistant bacteria are being developed.  Perhaps, two of the most promising possibilities being developed are peptide antibiotics, and phages (viruses that eat bacteria). However, it will be years before these medications will be able to do much.  In the meantime, bacterial resistance will increase alarmingly.<br />This book is not pleasant reading.  But it is a wake up call to an an enormous health care problem that at its extreme, threatens the existence of humankind.	2002-10-10

Will Bagley has chosen to tackle one of the most difficult subjects in Western American History--the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  Bagley is to be commended for examining new sources of information, re-examining old sources, and drawing deeper conclusions than in previously written material.<br />This book challenges Juanita Brook's \\"Mountain Meadows Massacre\\" as being the most authoritative book dealing with the subject. Brook's book was well-written and meticulously researched.  However, Brooks was too accepting of unsupported statements and failed, perhaps, to reach certain logical conclusions.<br />For those who are unaware, in 1857, an unfortunate group of pioneers traveling by covered wagon from Arkansas passed through Utah Territory on their way to California.  The journey happened to coincide with the murder of LDS Church Apostle, Parley P. Pratt, in Arkansas shortly before.  It also occurred at the same time President Buchanan was sending the United States Army to Utah to gain control over the \\"disloyal\\" Mormons.  In September of 1857, as the pioneers were camped in the Mountain Meadows west of Cedar City they were initially assaulted by a group of Indians (there may have been Mormon settlers dressed as Indians among the group as well).  When several days of hard fighting failed to destroy the pioneers, a group of Mormons appeared on the scene and pretended to negotiate a ceasefire with the Indians.  As soon as the Arkansas pioneers laid down their guns, they were than slaughtered by a group including both Mormons and Indians.  It is estimated 120 people were butchered in this fashion.<br />Only one man, John D. Lee, was ever tried in a court of law for this crime and that occurred twenty years later after a massive cover-up took place involving church leaders and the whole community in southern Utah.  Lee alone paid the penalty for this event.  He was executed by firing squad in 1877 for his role in the massacre.<br />Many haunting questions remain unanswered:  1. How many Mormons were involved in the massacre? 2. Was the massacre the result of action by local church leaders, or a directive from the President of the Church? 3. Why did the church allow the property of the emigrants to be looted by settlers and Indians? 4. Why was there a need to cover-up the details of this incident for so many years afterwards? 5. Why was John D. Lee the only man punished for the crime?<br />Bagley's answers are more disturbing than anything that has ever been written about the massacre so far.  He concludes that the killing of the settlers had to be ordered in some fashion by high church leaders.  And, it is difficult to explain away the actions of Apostle George A Smith who left Salt Lake City and rode south at the time to condemn the pioneers in the wagon train, at the same time they arrived in Salt Lake City.  It is also difficult to explain away the journal entries of Dimick Huntington which provide support for the theory that church leaders encouraged Indians to attack the pioneers.<br />Bagley is subject to criticism because much of any account of the massacre is simply \\"interpretation\\".  Bagley chooses to interpret evidence to blame church leaders.  In fact, the evidence may be capable of different interpretations.  Perhaps, Bagley doesn't give Brigham Young enough credit for the letter he sent to the Southern Utah communities instructing them to leave the pioneers alone. (which somehow arrived just a day or two too late to prevent he massacre).  Also, its difficult to rely on much of anything John D. Lee said.  Lee wrote and said many contradictory things about the massacre.  Additionally, his statements may have been motivated by a desire to escape criminal responsibility for his acts.  Much of the other evidence in the book is both dated and circumstantial.<br />However, if there is a conclusion that can be drawn from the book it is this.  The true and complete story of the massacre has never been told.  Obviously, there ismuch more to it than has ever been explained.  That the church participated in a coverup of the events cannot be denied.  And, one has to ask why, if no one \\"higher up\\" had any culpability for what occurred.<br />Will Bagley is to be applauded for tackling a difficult subject and having the courage to reach the conclusions that he has.  Perhaps, his book will result in more thoughtful research and inquiry into this subject.	2002-10-06

It must be remembered that the last chapter (update) was written in 1994.  Unfortunately, so much has occurred between 1994 and the present in terms of the Mideast conflict that Friedman's book is dated.  Since the writing of this volume we have seen the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin, the breakdown of peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians when PLO Chairman Arafat declined Prime Minister Barak's offer of most of the occupied territories in return for an end to the conflict, and the election of hawkish Ariel Sharon as the newest Israeli Prime Minister.<br />Despite the fact it is dated, Friedman has written a wonderful and useful book.  His chapters on life in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War is both horrifying and surrealistic.  Friedman was finally able to explain to me why our marines in Lebanon became a target for bombs in the early 1980's that killed 240 of them.  The answer is that we made the mistake of siding with Christian forces against Islamic militias when we would should have remained neutral.<br />Friedman explains the strange position of Syria in the conflict.  Syria desires peace, but does not want to make a formal treaty with Israeli that would recognize the legitimacy of the Jewish state.  Friedman recounts little known acts of brutality by the Syrian dictator Assad (now deceased).  When certain elements in the country opposed his regime, Assad sent tanks into a city called Hama and utterly destroyed it killing over 10,000 people.<br />Friedman explains that many Arab states are simply the result of arbitrary lines drawn in the desert by the British and French at the end of World War I.  Such artificial boundaries impeded the formation of real countries and split up tribes and families in the process.  As a result, many of these countries are not cohesive societies.<br />Friedman is pessimistic about peace in the Middleast and after viewing the events of the last year or two this seems strangely prophetic.  He does say, though, that the chance exists and that USA can help move the process forward through a combination of diplomacy, behind the scenes pressure, and a willingness to bargain.<br />Its a terrific book.  Its well written and achieves the difficult task of holding the attention of people while simultaneously explaining the complicated dynamics of the Middleast conflict.	2002-09-24

My parents who both served in World War II, years ago,told me the story about the North Platte Canteen.  This canteen, organized in a little town in Nebraska, made a point of serving food and drink at no charge to every serviceman and servicewoman who passed through town on troop trains during World War II (1941-1945).  <br />Soldiers and sailors all over the country spoke in awe about the wonderful food and treatment they got from the townspeople of North Platte, Nebraska. Many soldiers struck up penpal correspondence with townspeople they met.  A number of women in the North Platte area ended up marrying soldiers when they returned from the war.<br />Bob Greene takes a &quot;Studs Terkel approach&quot; to this subject and much of the book consists of narratives of older people who were present at the time.  One thing that really stands out is the unbelievable effort that the people in North Platte (and surrounding areas) made to run the canteen. Only a few thousand people lived in the area. Yet, millions of soldiers passed through the town.  Nevertheless, very soldier was served food and drink.  Many people contributed their ration coupons, personal savings, and a huge amount of unpaid labor to see that the canteen was always running.  These people will forever remain in the hearts of the soldiers and sailors who received their warm hospitality<br />Greene also relates the changes that have come to North Platte since the war.  Sadly, many have not been for the good.  A town that used to see 32 passenger trains a day pass through it, now sees none at all.  The railroad station and area where the canteen operated was torn down by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1973.  All that remains is a small historical marker commemorating the canteen.  It strikes me that North Platte has suffered the way many small towns in America have.  Agriculture has declined.  Industry and technology tends to base itself in large urban areas.<br />This is a &quot;feel good&quot; book.  As I read this, I was reminded of the adage that when it comes to saving our world all of us must &quot;think globally and act locally&quot;.  This is precisely what the people of North Platte, Nebraska did during World War II.  Any serviceman who passed through there will tell you that it made an enormous difference too.	2002-08-20

I did note that &quot;Master of the Senate&quot; is the longest volume yet.  Its 1040 pages of narrative.  The other two books, altogether, were not much longer than this.<br />&quot;Master of the Senate&quot; chronicles Lyndon Johnson's meteoric rise from freshman Senator in 1948, to Democratic Minority Leader a few years later, to Democratic Majority Leader in 1955. Of course, Linda left the Senate in 1961 to assume the post of Vice President in the Kennedy Administration.  The formula for Johnson's success in such a short time included getting to know the right people such as Senator Richard Russell of Georgia.  It included recognizing that there was room for a senator to act as sort of a &quot;mediator&quot; within the democratic party which at the time was increasingly becoming split between northern liberals and southern conservatives who each called themselves democrats. Johnson played the role of the mediator well, always having something to give each side.<br />One interesting point Caro makes is that until Lyndon took the job, the office of Senate Majority Leader was not a desirable or powerful position.  Other men who had held the job in the past had been weak and ineffectual.  The reason for this is because the real &quot;powers to be&quot; in the senate at that time were committee chairmen who had been in office for many years and held their positions based purely on seniority.  When Lyndon assumed the post of Majority Leader things began to change.  He was able to depart from the rigid seniority system to make committee assignments.  He skillfully used this power to ingratiate himself with both liberals and conservatives. Johnson was able to take a position that had little power and to use it to make himself into possibly the most powerfulsenator in Washington, D.C.<br />The capstone of Johnson's senate career was passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.  The act itself didn't accomplish a great deal.  It dealt rather ineffectually with the voting rights of African Americans.  However, the mere passage of a law after years and years of successful filibustering of such legislation by southern senators was a remarkable accomplishment.  Caro relates in great detail how Johnson engineered the compromises necessary to pass a law.  For anyone interested in how the legislative process works its a fascinating story.  The passage of the Act was the beginning of the end for segregation in the deep South.<br />In this volume, Caro again deals with the question of whether Johnson really cared about civil rights and minorities or whether his actions in public office simply represented a naked grab for power.  There is room to argue for both positions.  However, when all is said and done Johnson is far more than mere talk.  We can look to the enactment of not only the Civil Rights Act of 1957, but later to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Those who want to bash Johnson can hammer away, but no other living person can claim responsibility for such accomplishments.<br />Caro's book is the third volume in what appears to be a four volume set.  Its one of the best history books of the year. No one interested in history should avoid reading it.	2002-07-12

Reuben Clark	Books	3	15	19	N	N	A Distinguished Man	Michael Quinn is without a doubt the most objective biographer of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and its members who is currently alive.  Quinn's books are always well-researched.  It should be noted that Quinn has paid his dues for his committment to honest history.  He was excommunicated some years ago by the Church.  Nothing, though, has caused Quinn to give up either objective scholarship or a painstaking committment to telling the truth.<br />\\"Elder Statesman\\" is the biography of a famous LDS church leader, J. Reuben Clark.  Clark had a fascinating career.  He began life in small town in Utah in the nineteenth century.  His intellectual talents carried him to the University of Utah, Columbia University Law School, the United States Department of State and finally to a position as United States Ambassador to Mexico.  Clark obviously had immense intellectual and mental gifts to get where he did in life.<br />At this point, Clark was called to serve as Second Counselor to LDS Church President Heber J. Grant.  During the next 29 years, Grant served as both second and first counselor in the administrations of Heber J. Grant, George Albert Smith, and finally, David O. McKay.  He brought to these positions tremendous administrative talents.  This era was an extremely important time for the church.  The groundwork was laid for the tremendous expansion of the Church that occurred and is still occurring.<br />Quinn points out failings in Clark as a person.  By present day standards he was extremely racist, even demanding that Utah hospitals segregate the blood of African Americans from others. Clark was also hostile to Jews and opposed the entry of the USA into the Second World War.  In fact, he even went so far as to comment favorably upon the Nazi Regime' in Germany, after the war had begun.  Clark found himself at odds with most Mormons when opposed the New Deal policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt.  More than sixty-two percent of all Utahns voted to re-elect Roosevelt in the 1936 election.  These sections are a bit difficult, and I admit that after reading them, I lost considerable respect for a person, who in all other ways, was a bright and gifted man.<br />There are some things I don't like about the way Quinn has written this book.  First, he chronologically reviews Clark's life in the first 179 pages of the book.  At this point, Clark passes away.  Quinn than spends another 245 pages jumping back and looking at different \\"target areas\\" of his subject's life. I found that to be a bit disjointed.  I would have preferred using all the pages to the tell Clark's life story and working the other material into the places in between.  Second, this is not the most interesting book in the world.  It is about too narrow a subject to be of interest to many people outside of Utah and the Mormon faith.  Even those within it may struggle a bit to get through some of the sections which deal with mundane issues such as beer ads on KSL television, or support for Sunday closing laws in the legislature.<br />On the balance, this is an honest and informative book about a brilliant administrator and leader, barely known outside Utah.elect Roosevelt in the 1936 election.

Lewis does not do much of a job holding anyone's attention.  He has not written this for impact.  Its clearly intended to be a pure scholarly work. Having said all of that, it clearly is a most relevant book for those interested in trying to understand the attack on the WTC by islamic extremists, the ceaseless fighting by the Palestinians against Israel, and the general hostility towards the United States by the Arab world.<br />Essentially, Lewis tries to pinpoint historical differences in Western and Islamic society that lead to the West achieving economic superiority.  Some of the differences are quite illuminating.  First, apparently, about the time the Renaissance was occuring in Western Europe, Islamic society which had one time flourished as a center for education and the arts was gradually becoming more and more inward.  People in the west had an interest in the Middle East, but few people in the Middle East felt the West was worthy of attention.  Second, Islamic society through the Koran and Shariah legitimized slavery, inequality of women, and poor treatment of non-believers in ways that didn't occur in most western countries.  Third, western societies--largely at the request of religion--created the idea of separation of church and state.  No such distinction was ever made in Islam, nor does it exist at present.  Fourth, when it became apparent to Islamic leaders that their societies lagged behind the west, they saw the solution as to import western technology, failing to understand that western values are what produced the technology in the first place.<br />That these countries lag behind the west cannot be disputed.  If we take oil out of the equation, Lewis points out that all the countries together produce less wealth than the single European country of Finland.  Its a tremendous shock when one realizes how many hundreds of millions of people live in Islamic countries.<br />Besides being a challenge to read, Lewis does not deal much with solutions to the problems in his book.  I would have been most interested in seeing him analyze these in more detail.<br />I can recommend this book to serious students of the Middle East conflict with scholarly leanings.  Other people might be well to read something that holds one attention easier and is easier to understand.Lewis does not deal much with solutions to the problems in his book.

McMurrin on Philosophy, Education, and Religion	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Fearless Intellectual and Local Hero	This is a book of primarily local and regional interest.  For those who are unaware, Sterling McMurrin was a professor of philosophy at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City during the 50's, 60's, 70' and 80's.  Sterling was considered one of the most scholarly and capable professors at the University and held a variety of important academic positions.  In fact, during the John F. Kennedy Presidential administration, Sterling was United States Commissioner of Education (the position that was the forerunner of the cabinet level post, Secretary of Education).<br />Those who do not live in the Mormon culture in Utah may not be able to appreciate large segments of the book.  Sterling describes his years teaching Mormon Seminary in the Church Educational System and his subsequent history in the church.  The most fascinating part of the book for me was when Sterling ran afoul of church leaders Joseph Fielding Smith and Harold B. Lee for honestly informing them he did not believe in the most basic Mormon teachings.  The subsequent story of him *almost* being brought to trial in a church court and being excommunicated is very interesting and entertaining.  Apparently, than church President David O McKay personally intervened and prevented this from occurring.  McMurrin met personally with McKay and the details of their conversation are highly interesting.  It also furnishes an important insight as to why the LDS Church failed to open the priesthood to African Americans until 1978. (McKay favored doing it, but many people underneath him did not)<br />After finishing the book, I was proud.  I am proud that the University of Utah had such a distinguished professor for so many years.  I am proud that the Mormon culture of which I am a part is capable of producing free-thinkers and intellectuals like McMurrin.  Sterling McMurrin died in 1996.  However, he left behind a legacy of fearless intellectual freedom and inquiry that will long prevail at the University of Utah.	2002-03-12
US	49165722	R2VK36K8IDXUEC	0375408746	411655503	The News About the News: American Journalism in Peril	Books	4	20	20	N	N	The Decline of Quality Journalism	Leonard Downie and Robert Kaiser have written a book that describes what is wrong with American journalism.  Those who have observed the media during the last 15 to 20 years have noted disturbing trends:  1. News that seems more like entertainment than real news; 2. A decline in the quality and quantity of real hard news stories in papers and t.v news.; 3. More stories about actors, sports figures, and celebrities; 4. News that seems more like a paid promotion by a corporation than news.<br />The authors tell us why this has occurred.  Essentially, many newspapers, t.v. stations, and radio stations have been taken over by huge corporations like Gannett or AOL-Time Warner.  These corporations are fixed upon obtaining a certain bottomline profit margin from each station year by year.  To this end, they have limited space for hard news stories, laid off thousands of reporters, increased entertainment type features, and do little investigative reporting (which is expensive).  They have also raised advertising rates and in some situations, involved themselves with inappropriate relationships with businesses who advertise in their mediums.<br />The authors point out through a number of examples, exactly why good journalism is important to a community.  Solid news coverage on a state/national/international level has helped inform the American people of complex realities, enabling them to make sound decisions in the Representative Democracy in which we live.  It has helped cracked scandals like Watergate wide open.  It has helped states realize and rectify problems in their educational and social systems.  It has explained much of the current problems with Muslims and Osama Bin Laden, so that we can understand what occurred on September 11, 2001 better.<br />The authors are wrong about some things.  I noted that both Downie and Kaiser started in journalism in the sixties, before the advent of the computer age.  Perhaps, this is what makes them hostile to presentation of news stories with fancy computer graphics, maps, and other audio/visual effects.  I don't see this as a problem.  I think an authoritative news cast could make use of both good reporting and the technologies of the information age that allow us to make better presentations and allow for more effective communication with an audience.<br />While I largely agree with the authors, I also note this problem.  The term \\"news\\" and \\"newsworthy\\" is a very subjective term.  Any two people may experience serious disagreement about what is a legitimate \\"news story\\" and what is not. For example, a president having sex with his intern may or not may not be a news story.  Perhaps, the line is when you can show that his doing so is somehow interfering with his official duties.  By arguing that the media needs to do a better job reporting news, and complaining about particular types of reporting,the authors in essence conclude that some matters are not \\"newsworthy\\".  The authors opinion on this maybe no better or worse than our own.<br />What I found most discouraging about the book is that the solutions are going to be very difficult.  Things have reached the point they have because of demands for profitability by huge multi-national corporations.  Its a very involved process and will be difficult to rectify.<br />In the end, the authors simply make the point that if the American public wants good journalism it has the power to demand it, by refusing to watch or read poor journalism.  That action will send the greatest message of all to those who are in charge.	2002-03-08

This book is Daniel Schorr's auto-biography of his many decades in journalism.  Few people have had the opportunity to be the eyewitness to history that Schorr has had.  Schorr was present to cover Nikita Khruschev and the De-Stalinization movement in Russia.  He was present to cover post-nazi Germany under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.  He was able to cover aspects of the &quot;Great Society&quot; under Lyndon Johnson.  Also, he was there during Watergate and was sufficiently critical of the Nixon Administration to make the White House &quot;enemies list&quot;.<br />Schorr's ability to communicate directly with the personalities such as Khruschev, former Yugoslavian President Tito, and Chancellor Adenauer of West Germany was most impressive.  Clearly these were the days before journalism became swollen with hordes of &quot;news hungry&quot; reporters.  I doubt any correspondent today could get as much access to similar political and public figures.<br />While dealing with earth-shaking events and personalities, the book also touches on Schorr's day-to-day existence.  Difficulties such as avoiding taxes in the Soviet Union, obtaining a refrigerator, and functioning in a communist country are interesting, as well as amusing.  One also is touched by the descriptions of the people in foreign countries who worked for him.<br />Schorr viewed Johnson's &quot;Great Society&quot; programs as failing because the administration gave up on them, and reduced funding due to the demands of the Vietnam War.  He rejects the conservative ideology that the programs failed because they were inherently flawed in some fashion.  Its refreshing to hear another viewpoint besides the one that seems to be parroted constantly.<br />Its clear that Daniel Schorr is a person who by practicing his occupation as a journalist in a courageous and intelligent fashion, contributed much to American Democracy.  The American people cannot make informed and sound decisions without good information from journalists.  The First Amendment guarantee of &quot;freedom of the press&quot; would mean little without tough-minded journalists pursuing stories of national importance.  God bless Daniel Schorr as he reaches his golden years of life.  One only hopes there are other courageous men and women who will take his place.	2001-12-28

Years ago, I attempted to read the first volume, &quot;The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and never made it through the book.  Morris's recitation of Theodore's experiences with lesser public offices simply didn't hold my attention.  <br />Happily, the second book, &quot;Theodore Rex&quot;, is far more interesting.  The book begins with Theodore assuming the presidency after the assassination of William McKinley.  And, what a time it was to become President!  The United States was undergoing tremendous progress and technological change.  Railroads were spanning the country.  Electricity was beginning to illuminate all major American Cities.  Use of the telephone was becoming more widespread.  American production of goods and services had surpassed every country on the planet.  Morris somehow has a way of making the reader feel the excitement of being in America at the turn of the century. In fact, I felt that the book was as much a recitation of the historical period as it was a chronicle of the Roosevelt Presidency.<br />Yet Morris also points out the difficulties.  Many people labored in low paying jobs for ten and twelve hours a day.  Monopolies and trusts were carving up entire industries to profit a mere handful of people.  Natural resources were being plundered in an unwise fashion.  The people of the United States had yet to understand the responsibilities that went along with becoming a great economic power.<br />Morris chronicles how TR jumped into the void left by the death of McKinley to become one of our country's greatest Presidents. TR immediately took charge and initiated the antitrust prosecution of the Northern Securities Company which ultimately ended with a court ordered breakup of that railroad trust.  He hotly pursued the creation and building of the Panama Canal and left office as construction was well underway.He successfully arbitrated a strike in the coal mines that paved the way for union recognition and collective bargaining.  He presided over the passage of legislation mandating the production of sanitary foods and beverages. He got legislation passed limiting and restricting freight rates by monopolistic railroads.  He succeeded in getting money from Congress to build a world class navy and military.  Finally, he promoted conservation of natural resources and got the legislation passed that allows presidents to designate national monuments.<br />Morris points out some of Theodore's failures as a President.  His rhetoric while speaking sometimes made enemies instead of winning converts. He was not immune from racism.  He presided over the discharge of many black soldiers from the military based on the &quot;Brownsville Incident&quot; where proof of individual wrong-doing was totally lacking.  Sometimes he was impulsive and inclined to ignore the law based on his interpretation of the greater good.  Finally, he failed to win passage of other progressive legislation he championed such as the eight hour work day and child labor laws.<br />Its a fascinating book.  Its on par with &quot;Truman&quot; and &quot;John Adams&quot; both excellent books written by historian David McCullough.  This book simply should not be missed by anyone interested in American History.<br />                           Mark	2001-12-10

Rickie Solinger has written several books that deal with the reproductive rights of women.  &quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot; which dealt with unwed pregnancy and the cultural climate which promoted adoption prior to the legalization of abortion in the 1973 Supreme Court decision of Roe v. Wade was a particularly insightful book.  She has also written about women who obtained illegal abortions prior to 1973 in her book &quot;The Abortionist&quot;.<br />Those who have read her earlier books will recognize some of her sources and conclusions.  Although, the research she did years ago is very valuable.  Those familiar with Rickie's work realize that her greatest asset as a writer is her ability to review and analyze recent history and use it to demonstrate the truth of certain hypotheses she has developed about the treatment of women. <br />The central premise of &quot;Beggar and Choosers&quot; is that society has developed a dynamic about discussing the reproductive rights of women that focuses on the word &quot;choice&quot;.  In Rickie's view, this is flawed reasoning because women and particularly poor and minority women, don't really have the &quot;choices&quot; we believe that they do when it comes to preventing pregnancies, obtaining abortions, or raising children when they lack the resources to do so in a manner that is culturally acceptable in America today.<br />Instead of focusing on &quot;choice&quot;, Rickie believes society should focus instead on &quot;rights&quot;.  The right to decide how many children one wants, the right to decide upon an abortion, etc. Such a &quot;rights-based model&quot; would work far more in the interests of women than this &quot;choice&quot; model which only benefits those who, in her estimation, can afford the respective choices.<br />The problem is that while Rickie is quick to talk about what rights ought to be, she doesn't explore or discuss what the cost or consequences of granting what these rights might be.  If all women are going to have the right to have as many children as they--regardless of whether they can afford to support them--someone is going to have pay for it.  Presumably, these are the taxpayers who will pay through higher costs for AFDC, federal child care programs, food stamps, medicaid etc.<br />Rickie deals with the discrimination, stigmatization, and abuse which unwed and single mothers have faced in our society. Its not a pretty picture and attempts by political figures to assert that all people on public assistance were &quot;welfare queens&quot; or cheats is some of the worst demagoguery that has occurred by politicians.  Nevertheless, Rickie never stops to ask about the legitimate negative social consequences that arise from phenomenon of single parenthood:  increased poverty; increased crime and delinquency; and higher school drop out rates among the children.  Perhaps,in light of this, society does have some interest in trying to maintain the viability of a two-parent household.<br />Finally, Solinger presents poor and working class women as having no choices.  In reality, I don't think this is exactly correct.  Choices often do exist, its simply that they aren't &quot;good choices&quot;.  What must be factored into it as well, is that all individuals have some responsibility for their choices, or lack of good choices.  If we deny this, we deny the very notion of freedom and liberty.  Although, such reasoning should never become an excuse to ignore the plight of the poor and underprivileged in society.<br />The book is well-researched and Solinger presents us, again, with an interesting point and reaches conclusions about that point.  The problem is that she doesn't present the whole picture and as a result there are flaws in her conclusions. It is stimulating and should serve as a focus for discussion and questions, rather than being treated as an end itself.<br />                                Mark	2001-11-21

This book looks at the importance of Watergate in the context of subsequent presidencies.<br />There is alot of detailed recitation of scandals in different Presidential administrations here.   They range from the absolutely silly (the investigation of whether Hamilton Jordan, Jimmy Carter's Chief of Staff, snorted cocaine) to important ones (such as Iran-Contra under President Reagan and recently the Monica Lewinsky affair under Bill Clinton's Administration)<br />Watergate created a new climate for Presidents that is both good and bad.  The good part is that Presidents have to take into account the fact that failure to behave ethically in office may result in resignation or impeachment.  The bad part is that much of the modern presidency is now focused on &quot;damage control&quot; and avoiding scandals rather than simply governing.  Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton all learned that media scrutiny is much greater and the Independent Counsel Law could be used to conduct witch hunts rather than investigate wrongdoing.<br />In essence, Woodward sees good in what has occurred, but also argues that the American Presidency is now a diminished office because of all the scrutiny from the press and legal profession that is a direct result of Watergate and the enactment of the Independent Counsel Law.<br />My greatest complaint about Woodward's book is that he could spend more time analyzing and less time simply regurgitating history.  He tells us what happened, but fails to suggest alternatives or ways that we could have both ethics in government, yet avoid diminishing the powers of the Presidency. Admittedly, this might be difficult.  However, Woodward doesn't even make the effort. His failure to really make an attempt to do so a serious disappointment to me as a reader.<br />The redeeming feature of the book is that it is good, solid reporting and accurate contemporaneous history.  Those who are interested in a behind the scenes look at modern presidential scandals should read this book.<br />                              Mark	2001-11-12

While both administrations had many capable people working for them, both made numerous mistakes in their handling of this problem.<br />Halberstam does a good  job of educating those who don't know exactly what was going on in this part of the world and why.  Many Americans still don't understand what really happened in the Balkans.  This book is a great way for them to inform themselves.<br />Halberstam clearly believes that an initial show of force against Yugoslavian President Slobadan Milosevic could have stopped much of this tragedy.  The failure to use force initially, despite widespread reports of genocide and killing, can best be explained as caution which resulted from the Vietnam experience.  Often, military leaders were the most reluctant to support the use of force against Milosevic and the Serbs.<br />At times, Halberstam overestimates the importance of the Balkans to the United States.  Its a tragedy when you look at what has happened to the people who live there.  But, a grim reality is that the American people--living many thousands of miles away--could not be expected to have more than minimal interest in this feud which has gone for centuries.  Part of our unwillingness to become involved stemmed from the Vietnam Experience.  The other part of it stemmed from the relative lack of importance the Balkans has to our foreign policy or economy.<br />Be prepared for alot of background on the individual civilian and military leaders in place in both the Bush and Clinton Administrations.  Its fascinating reading, but a little hard to keep one person straight from another at times.<br />This is a highly informative and well written book.	2001-10-29

The tragedy of Richard Nixon is that every time someone wants to think well of him, tapes or something else surfaces that shows his real unpleasant, dark, and unsavory character.<br />John Dean waited for the release of these tapes and along with his personal recollections during the time period has written a book that deals with the selection of Rehnquist and Lewis Powell as United States Supreme Court Justices.  Its not pleasant reading for those naive enough to believe that Presidents seek out the most qualified people for appointments.  Rather, the book exposes the process used by President Nixon to select two supreme court justices as frought with politics, bigotry, and regionalism.  Nixon's bigotry about Jews, prejudice against easterners, and nasty language make this a book that someone who is very sensitive should not read.<br />The real shocker here is that before picking Powell who was a superbly qualified justice, Nixon first selected two candidates who could not even win acceptance as \\"qualified\\" for the Supreme Court by the American Bar Association Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  Nixon stubbornly tried to get these individuals appointed until it became absolutely clear it was hopeless.  Only at this point, did a real candidate like Powell get nominated.  Nixon further abused the process by sending names to the ABA of other people he knew would never win approval.<br />Rehnquist had good paper qualifications to sit on the Supreme Court.  However, it was known early on he was extremely conservative.  He may have lied about statements he allegedly made expressing approval of racial segregation in schools.  Dean presents the case for this.  Its up to the reader to judge.<br />In the end, we are left gasping at the twisted and bizarre process which put Rehnquist on the Supreme Court.  Even those who support Rehnquist and otherconservative justices should wish for a better process to select judges.  Hopefully, one day we shall see such a process and never see another President like Nixon again.<br />                              Mark	2001-10-18

For sources, Arrington draws heavily on Brigham Young's personal correspondence and that of his contemporaries of the time period. For those who aren't aware of it, Arrington was the LDS Church's official librarian for a time. He allowed unprecedented access to church archives for historians. His book on Young is for the most part dispassionate and fair.<br /><br />Young began life in a large family in Vermont. After leaving home, he worked as a painter, carpenter, and glazier. Like many people of the day, he had quite an interest in religion. When Mormon missionaries came around with a Book of Mormon, he and many of his family members converted in a short period of time.<br />After serving a successful church mission in England, Joseph Smith, the founder of the church, was quick to see his talents and made him one of the twelve Apostles of the Church. When Smith and his brother Hyrum were murdered by a mob in Carthage, Illinois in 1844, Young assumed leadership of the church by sheer force of personality.<br /><br />The book recounts Young's main accomplishments and they are broad in scope. He organized the migration of thousands of Mormon pioneers across the Great Plains to Utah, set up the framework for a nearly self-sufficient colony,and played a critical role in building up Utah and the Church during the last 30 years of his life from 1847-1877. The book also deals with some of his failures. Young had hoped to see iron mined and made into steel--this venture failed. He had hoped to grow cotton in Southern Utah--that didn't work either. He hoped to grow and refine sugar beets into sugar. After a costly investment, this too, failed.<br /><br />The major weakness in its book is its failure to criticize Young in three notable areas. Young openly promoted the practice of polygamy, or plural marriage. The saints practice of polygamy proved to be a real albatross. And until another Church President issued a statement in 1890 ending it, it had created a horrible situation. Many saints were sent to prison for practicing polygamy. At one point, church properties were seized by the US Government for non-compliance with the law. Polygamist families were forced to hide to avoid arrest. There was tremendous social disruption. The other area that Arrington explains, rather than criticizes was Young's attempt late in life to institute the \\"United Order\\" among Mormons. This essentially required members to contribute property to the community and receive back whatever church leaders thought they should have. It never got off the ground, and was a surprising failure for a man as astute as Brigham Young.  Astonishing, the book also fails to deal with the Mountain Meadows Massacre and the subsequent cover-up of this affair by church leaders and authorities.<br /><br />Arrington does a good job of telling the life story of a bright, practically-minded man (for the most part) who contributed enormously to not only building up his church, but to settling the Western United States.ident issued a statement in 1890 ending it, it had created a horrible situation.

Thomas Stewart Ferguson did and rather than run from what he concluded was the truth, he dealt with it openly, but in a manner that was designed not to hurt the people closest to him.<br />While educated to be an attorney, Ferguson from an early age determined that as an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons)it was his destiny to do archaelogical research that would once and for all, prove the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.  Accordingly, Ferguson organized the New World Archaeology Foundation and began excavating a number of cites in the Yucatan area of Mexico where he theorized the Nephites and Lamanites (peoples' spoken of in the Book of Mormon) lived.  Ferguson began the task with great enthusiasm.  He was finally able to enlist official church support for his project after there were a couple of ambiguous findings at one or two of his &quot;digs&quot; in Central America.<br />In the late 1960's, Ferguson's enthusiasm began to wane.  All the excavating being done by his foundation was failing to find anything new that would help &quot;authenticate&quot; the Book of Mormon. Worse, new discoveries were shedding light on other LDS scripture, the Book of Abraham. In short, the original papyri from which this scripture was &quot;translated&quot; came to light.  Modern Egyptologists who examined these documents concluded they were from an entirely different time period and about an entirely different subject than Joseph Smith claimed when he &quot;translated&quot; this scripture.<br />At some point, Ferguson lost his faith and began looking at other questions. However, he was very sensitive to the fact that many of his family members were true believers in the church. He refused to become an advocate against the church, believing very strongly that organized religion(whether true or not)had a valid role to play in society. The book obtained and quotes from written correspondence from him to other people about matters of faith.  Ferguson never encouraged anyone to leave the LDS faith who was happy. He focused strictly on what evidence showed about historical and scientific claims of the church.<br />In the end, we are presented with the evidence that caused a bright, committed member of the church to leave.  We are also presented with the portrait of a man of integrity and conscience who squarely faced the fact that he got an answer to perhaps his most important question in life--and that answer was something totally different than what he anticipated.<br />The book is well worth reading.	2001-09-10

Former 1972 democratic presidential candidate, George McGovern, was the pilot of B-24 Liberator bombers in the second world war. The book is largely about McGovern and his experiences learning to fly, joining the Army Airforce, and his subsequent bombing missions over the Third Reich from 1944-45. Most people who remember McGovern think of him as a pacifist who opposed the Vietnam War. This is the other side of McGovern that probably few people suspect exists. Ambrose's book reminds me a bit of some of Studs Terkel's books. He largely obtains a narrative from McGovern and a few other people interviewed for the book and tells the story through their eyes. If narrative history is not for you, I would recommend you skip this book. This is not a book that deals with the &quot;why's&quot; or other complicated questions of history. Its history seen through the eyes of a flyer in his early twenties who was called upon by his nation to drop bombs on enemy targets in hopes of halting the German war machine. Its not particularly essential reading (many families have their own war stories) but it is interesting. Few people in generations since really understand the responsibility that World War II dumped on so many young Americans in their late teens and early twenties. For example, I found the stories about the difficulties involved in flying a B-24 to be amazing. Only in the last few pages of the book, does Ambrose deal generally with the affects of the bombing campaign on Germany. His conclusion was that to the extent the campaign concentrated on the petroleum industry and railroads that it was a success that helped tremendously in shortening the war. Other aspects of the campaign such as attacking ball bearing plants and German industry generally were surprisingly unsuccessful and the Germans found ways to keep up production. This is a good book for those preferring a personalized narrative account of experiencesin the war. Mark	2001-08-24

However, that would be a mistake.  This book isn't about politics, its simply a memoir of a boy who grew up in the rural south during the 1930's.  Its a down-to-earth and fascinating description of the way Jimmy, his family, and other Georgians lived during that time period which is also known as &quot;The Great Depression&quot;.<br />Those people who may appreciate his writings the most are probably those who lived through the time period.  However, I think Jimmy really intended his book as an educational tool for the younger generation.<br />Jimmy primarily tells the story through experiences he had with a variety of people:  His father, James Earl (a stern but capable father), his mother, Ms. Lillian (who defied stereotypes of the day and worked outside her home), several black share croppers he knew well, his Uncle Buddy, and finally his sisters and brother.  <br />Its a highly readable account of lifestyles and the problems rural farmers faced because of the Great Depression.  One part that has stayed with me was his father's angry reaction to having to plow his cotton crop underground one year because of New Deal agriculture policies designed to keep the price of cotton up.  Jimmy recounts how everyone struggled to keep their farms and businesses afloat under the most difficult circumstances.  He describes most of the people in the book in very positive terms.  Most of the people were hard-working, courageous, friendly, and law-abiding.  Virtues which many of us find absent in today's world.  There is an innocence and decency to his childhood that seems to have permanently vanished.<br />The only fault I could find with this book is that I think, at times, Jimmy takes too &quot;rose colored&quot; a view of the past.  He does admit to problems.....the discrimination encountered by black people in the south, the poverty of many rural farmers, lack of access tomedical care, etc.  However, these seem to be sidelights to the rest of the story.  The reality is that conditions were so hard that people lead shortened lives because of them. Discrimination against black people required that they attend segregated schools, eat in segregated restaurants, and run the risk of being lynched if they ever uttered a word of complaint. These social problems deserve more comment and condemnation than they get in this book.<br />On the balance, this book is a highly readable account of life in the 1930's.  Its a wonderful way to educate people who have no idea how people lived during this period about their way of life.  If one reads no other book that Jimmy Carter has written, I would recommend this one.	2001-08-16

Ellis's book &quot;Founding Brothers&quot; is good and gives us an interesting take on the men who founded America, yet it didn't seem to roll along as quickly, or as pleasurably as the Jefferson biography did.  I think this may have something to do with the way that Ellis presents the material in this book.<br />Rather than focus on one person and roll along chronologically, Ellis chooses to do something different in &quot;Founding Brothers&quot;.  He attempts to relate the making of the Constitution and the early years of the Republic based around events.  For example, one chapter deals with the Constitution and its silence on slavery.  Another chapter deals with the import of Washington's Farewell Address.  Another discusses the bond and collaboration between Jefferson and Madison.  Finally, the book concludes with the correspondence between Jefferson and Adams during the last years of both men's lives. At times, presenting the material in this fashion is hard to follow and seems a bit disjointed.<br />I don't recommend this book for someone just breaking into the history of the Constitution and the early years of the Republic. I'd suggest something a bit more exciting like David McCullough's book &quot;John Adams&quot;.  Another good pick for a beginner would be Fawn Brodie's book &quot;Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History&quot;. However, a student of this historical period, or someone with a good knowledge of the men involved will not have any problems with this book.<br />Nevertheless, the style that Ellis uses in this book is essential in making several important points.  First, the founding fathers struggled with a number of issues writing the Constitution and the end product was more the product of political compromise than any great enlightenment  Second, the events of the era did more to define the people involved (Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Franklin etc.) than the people did to define the events.  Third, at any moment something could have happened which could have substantially altered the course of events.  Fourth, those who look upon what happened as divinely inspired, or just short of perfection would do well to remember what the failure to adequately resolve the slavery problem created--a civil war that 75 years later cost 600,000 lives. <br />The founding fathers come through in this book as bright men who had imperfections like all people do. Jefferson was the slaveholder who condemned slavery.  Adams was a brilliant man who couldn't understand that laws punishing freedom of the press (the Sedition Law) violated the first amendment.  Hamilton comes through as a rather sinister character who may have wanted to use the army to take over the government and build an empire. Madison appears in the book as dogmatic and slavishly devoted to Jefferson.  Its a different slant than many are used to seeing. Its both informative and entertaining.<br />Its not a long book and its definitely worth reading if are interested in this historical period.	2001-07-29

Jefferson has had extensive biographies done by any number of authors (Joe Ellis and Fawn Brodie are two that come to my mind).  Other founding fathers such as Franklin and Washington have been extensively written about--and generally in a positive light.<br />On the other hand, little has been written about Adams. David McCullough's book \\"John Adams\\" helps fill this gap.  The book is generally positive about Adams.  In a sense, though, the title is a misnomer because McCullough writes extensively about the other founding fathers besides Adams.  At the end of the book, one has also been presented with alot of material about Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Jefferson, Madison, etc.  The book also tells us about Adams children, particularly John Quincy Adams who was also elected President for one term.<br />Adams achievements and services on behalf of his country include his role in preparing the Declaration of Independence, his service as a diplomatic envoy to France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain, his years as Vice-President, and finally serving one four-year term as President of the United States from 1797 to 1801.  Its a prodigious record and while doing all these things Adams and his family kept a voluminous record of his doings through personal correspondence that has been preserved.<br />The book while interesting, is probably not for those who are not interested in this period of history.  Its a lengthy book that relies a great deal on correspondence from the time.  If one doesn't have an interest already in the Revolutionary War, the early presidencies, and the first years of America this book is probably not going to create it.  McCullough's book, Truman, on the other hand is about events that occurred in the twentieth century and is so well-written that it can hold the interest of those who aren't rabid history no-it-alls.<br />My greatest criticism of \\"John Adams\\" is that, at times, McCullough isn't critical enough of Adams.  For example, during the Adams Presidency the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed and signed into law by Adams.  The Sedition law actually punished journalists for exercising their first amendment rights by writing articles critical of the President and the government.  Under this act, some journalists were imprisoned and fined for no greater crime than criticizing the Adams administration.  McCullough makes the point, but seems to mention it more in passing and seemingly lets Adams off the hook.  Actually, this is probably one of the more monumental blunders committed by a President and undoubtedly contributed to Adams defeat in office after one term.  Its clear that McCullough admires the subject of his book and is loathe to attack him.<br />I think McCullough begins the book in an interesting fashion. Rather, than detailing mundane and arcane circumstances of Adams birth and early years as a child, immediately, he instead jumps in at the beginning with Adams attending the convention in Philadelphia where the Declaration of Independence was drafted. Its a good way to launch the book and will hold the interest of most readers.<br />I enjoyed John Adams.  It ranks well as a history book and as one of the better books of this year.  Those with an interest in this period of time will not be disappointed.	2001-07-27

Fawn Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith is still the best book ever written about him that has been published.  In a way, that's a shame.  &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; was published in 1945, so historians have had 56 years to write a better book. For some reason, that hasn't occurred.  Other books written about Smith, such as Donna Hill's &quot;Joseph Smith, the First Mormon&quot; are not nearly as critical and insightful as they need to be.  <br />Legitimate criticisms of the book include the fact that it is written more to be interesting than a strictly scholarly work. Brodie does use interesting language and sometimes draws too much on the flamboyant and theatrical parts of Joseph Smith's personality.  Additionally, while its been proven Brodie reached a pretty accurate conclusion, in the first edition of her book she relies too much on the so-called &quot;Pearsall transcript&quot; of Smith's 1826 trial for money-digging in Bainbridge, NY.  Although, subsequent research bears out most of the conclusions.<br />&quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; is not without a number of weaknesses.  It is clear that Fawn views Smith as a fraud and an impostor.  Perhaps, she didn't look hard enough to find some &quot;middle ground&quot; between &quot;Prophet&quot; and &quot;fraud&quot;.  Maybe, Smith really believed he was transcribing ancient scripture and had been annointed by God to be Prophet, when in fact he did not. Some people do suffer hallucinations.  In fact, a number of people who are terribly rational most of the time claim to have dreams or revelations occasionally which can only be described as &quot;supernatural&quot;.  Another possibility is he really believed he was inspired to lead people to Christ, but invented the Book of Mormon to get the attention of people.<br />Brodie does not adequately take into the account the following in my estimation:<br />1. The sincerity expressed in the writings in Joseph Smith's own journals which have been published and are available to read.<br />2. The fact that the three witnesses to the Golden Plates, Cowdery, Whitmer, and Harris, never retracted their statements about the Plates and the Book of Mormon, even on their death beds. (although they admitted they saw the Plates with their &quot;spiritual eyes&quot;, as opposed to their &quot;physical eyes&quot;).<br />3. The fact that Smith was willing to face being persecuted, tarred and feathered, and killed rather than give up what he was preaching.<br />There is a puzzle to Smith claiming to be a &quot;prophet&quot; that has never been adequately explained by anyone.  Although, there is plenty of evidence refuting Smith's claims and those of his church.<br />The weaknesses, though, are more than offset by the research she did and the material she found.  She documents the fact that Smith's father had a dream which later appeared in its entirety in First Nephi in the Book of Mormon, that Smith was tried for being an impostor and moneydigger in an 1826 court proceeding in Bainbridge, New York, that Smith routinely used to seer stones and claimed that with these stones he could see buried treasure underground, and in her 1971 edition, reported the three conflicting accounts that have been given of Smith's First Vision. Finally, she talks about the fact that Smith did not translate other scripture, the Book of Abraham, from Egyptian Papyri as claimed.<br />However, Brodie's greatest contribution is in establishing the context and background in which the Book of Mormon was produced. She talks about the many millenial religious movements where Smith grew up, the commonly held views that Indians were really descendants of Hebrew tribes, anti-catholic prejudice, anti-free masonry prejudice, and prejudice against people with darker skins.  One can find elements of all of these in the Book of Mormon if one looks closely enough at it.  One who wants too, can see how the Mormon religion and the Book of Mormon arose from this context.<br />NoMan Knows My History is a classic.  While it would be a mistake to read nothing else about Joseph Smith, skipping the book is missing the best biography that currently exists about him.	2001-06-19

In order to appreciate Michael Quinn's book, &quot;Early Mormonism and the Magic World View&quot; one must understand what a historical context book is. Its a book that doesn't attempt to draw broad conclusions, or answer ultimate questions. Rather, the book meticulously attempts to re-create a setting or context in which events occurred. It is thought that through re-creating context, one can increase the understanding of events that occurred within that context.<BR>Quinn probably more voluminously than any author to-date documents and establishes that the Mormon Church was born and spent its early years in a society that was dominated by people who claimed they could see visions in rocks (seer stones), could find treasure or objects by the use of divining rods, believed in amulets and talisman, placed great weight in astrology, and participated in the supernatural in many other ways.<BR>This context has alot of significance for those who have always been aware that the founder of the LDS Church used seer stones both to locate the Golden Plates, and to translate them after they were located. It also offers a more complete picture in rounding out Smith's trial for &quot;moneydigging&quot; which occurred in 1826 in Bainbridge, NY.<BR>Quinn presents some interesting material. However, at times one wonders if such a voluminous presentation is necessary. My other criticism of the book is the lengths he goes too (and the way he departs from the main text) to attack and disagree with opinions expressed by LDS Church Scholars.<BR>Nevertheless, if one wants to understand more about the roots of early Mormonism this book is a critical source that should not be overlooked.<BR>Mark	2001-05-14
US	49165722	R37HE7F66GFULI	156085118X	420085517	Joseph Smith: The First Mormon	Books	3	24	40	N	N	A Superficial Analysis of Joseph Smith	Donna Hill's book was a disappointment to me.  It gets three stars only because she does a respectable job in the last half of the book of recounting the Church's experience in Nauvoo, the polygamy issue, and the murder of Joseph and Hyrum Smith.<br />The most disappointing aspect of Hill's book is the superficial way she examines the evidence and circumstances surrounding the First Vision and the writing of the Book of Mormon.  She examines the three separate accounts written by Smith of his First Vision and essentially states they are reconciliable.  This echoes the assessment of the accounts made by Dean Jesse in his article in 1973 on the First Vision which occurred in Brigham Young University Studies Journal.  Hill leaves out the fact that Smith stated he was a different age during each recounting of the vision, that the message delivered by the heavenly beings was significantly different in each account, and that his inability to specifically date the vision differs dramatically from his ability to date with absolute specificity the vision that told him to go dig up the Golden Plates.<br />Also troubling about her analysis (or lack thereof) is the following:  1. She alludes to a dream that Smith's father had which is recounted in Lucy Smith's biography of her son, but fails to mention this dream somehow found its way totally intact into First Nephi in the Book of Mormon.  2. She fails to deal with the issue of Smith's imagination and the fact he told tales recounting the early inhabitants of the Americas prior to the time the Book of Mormon was translated (Lucy Smith's biography does recount this) 3. She discusses the subject matter of the Book of Mormon, but fails to deal at all with the vast body of extrinsic evidence that tends to refute its claims (the fact that there is no evidence that animals described in the Book of Mormon lived here during the time mentioned, DNA testing showing Indians are related to Asiatic peoples--instead of Middle Eastern Jews, the absence of archaelogy establishing metallurgy, shipbuilding, etc.)<br />Hill does deal with Smith's 1826 trial in Bainbridge, New York for being an &quot;imposter and moneydigger&quot;.  She does admit that he may have been convicted of the crime and put on probation, but fails to grasp some of the larger implications of the event.  First, the whole thing started when Josiah Stowel traveled all the way from Bainbridge to Palmyra to find Smith to look for buried treasure.  In order for this to occur, Smith *had* to have had a reputation for engaging in such activities that was fairly widely known.  Second, several accounts of the trial say that Stowel testified that he knew Smith could look into a seer stone and see buried treasure underneath the earth.  The implication of this is that Smith had broad persuasive powers.  Since people can't see what is underground with a seer stone one must conjecture why he claimed that he could.<br />I felt her treatment of the Book of Abraham controversy was inadequate.  She admits that modern Egyptologists that have translated part of the papyri from which the Book of Abraham was written have a very different translation than that which Smith claimed.  However, she suggests that perhaps the papyri only served as a &quot;catalyst&quot; which opened his mind to receive the inspiration to write the Book.  Perhaps, but entries from Smith's own journals during this time period use the language that he was preparing an Egyptian alphabet and grammar to translate the papyri.  One has to ask the question, just exactly when does a prophet say something that is accurate, and when does he not?<br />The book redeems itself, in part, by recounting history of the Saints, as Smith began to build the church.  Her recitation of the polygamy issue in not a whitewash.  The persecutions that the Mormon people endured in Missouri and Illinois are absolutely shocking.  Hopefully, they will never be repeated against any group, anywhere.  I hadn't realized, until I read this book, that things were so bad in Illinois at the time of the Mormon expulsion from Nauvoo, that Governor Ford actually feared Civil War.<br />Smith does come through in this book as a highly charismatic, very likeable, and highly intelligent individual.  This is a far cry from some church works which have attempted to paint him as an ignorant country boy.<br />An interesting, but a superficial book.	2001-03-27

At times, the accounts of the daughters are disjointed, rambling, and even a bit tedious.  Kingsolver deliberately makes some statements of the daughters hard to understand, to emphasize their age and worldview, I believe.  But its a chore for the reader to try and interpret what is being said.<br />The second major criticism I have of the book is that Kingsolver paints a very simplistic view of the politics and turmoil in the Congo from its independence in 1960 until present.  She seems to believe that the inhabitants of the Congo were victims of Belgian and than, later,  American &quot;imperialists&quot; following independence.  It seems clear from the way the characters tell the story that Kingsolver believes that if the Congolese people had simply been allowed to decide their own fate--without foreign intervention--than events in the Congo would have taken a much more favorable course.  This is part of the tired argument that all of Africa's problems can be traced to foreigners, colonialism, and slavery.  Surely, these factors have caused problems, but foreigners and colonialism left behind an economic infrastructure including roads, schools, ports, airports, and farms when the countries became independent.  Those who seek an explanation for Africa's backwardness must also look to tribalism, geographic isolation from much of the world, disease, and a harsh climate.<br />Having said that, the story does introduce readers to the tragic history of a nation deep in the heart of the jungles.  It gives us interesting characters, such as the crazy missionary, Nathan Price, and the nationalistic school teacher, Anatole, to ponder. It gives a good description of how the Congo passed from the Belgians through its first elected governmentand into the hands of a military dictator, Mobutu.  It also sets the stage and helps explain the recent turmoil there involved Laurent Kabila who was recently assassinated.  It describes the interactions of three daughters who pursue very different pathways in life and what becomes of them.<br />Its a mixed bag, but on the whole it was worth reading.	2001-02-09

Anne Babb, an adoption professional, has written a book that essentially concerns the issue of raising the ethical standards practiced by adoption practitioners in the USA. I write my review, as an adoptive parent who is somewhat familiar with the adoption system, and adoption practices. <br />Unquestionably, serious problems do exist.  Some of these problems include practices that keep adoptees from being able to access family history and health information (the open records problem), the lack of regulation and standards that are imposed on adoption agencies and attorneys by the states in which they practice, outright dishonesty by certain practitioners, and the unavailability of appropriate counseling services for all triad members served by agencies.  Babb reviews these problems and provides a history of adoption in America. <br />Babb also does a respectable job of reviewing different standards that have been compiled with respect to international adoption. She mentions standards developed by the Child Welfare League of America and the United Nations. As part of it, she reviews provisons of the CRC (Convention on the Rights of Children) that has recently been ratified by the US Senate.<br />She surveyed adoption professionals about different aspects of adoption practices and reports the conclusions of the surveys.  I noted, interestingly, that none of her survey participants appeared to be from any private adoption agencies--no matter what their reputation was.  However, all 50 of the state licensors of public adoption agencies were surveyed, as well as 22 &quot;child welfare organizations&quot;, among these groups were the Concerned United Birthparents (a group which has historically been opposed to most of adoption) and the National Association of Black Social Workers, which in 1972, called interracial adoption &quot;genocide&quot;. Given the fact that most adoption is done privately in the USA, it was not a surprise to me that many of the survey participants found fault with many aspects of adoption practices.  One curious finding of the survey was how many of the surveyed participants when asked to define &quot;best interest of the child&quot; proceeded to articulate as their three most important criteria, subjects that dealt with the birth family keeping the child in the first place.  The conclusions were interesting, overall, but the survey could hardly be called representative of adoption professionals, where no private agencies appear to have been represented.  At times, survey answers appeared ridiculous.  When asked what a reasonable adoption fee was, 27 survey participants, out of 73, felt that it should be less than....<br />The book is simply too idealistic.  Granted reforms are needed in terms of open records, and laws that are blatantly one-sided. However, to give an example, Babb suggests as a standard for reform, that the costs of running adoption agencies be paid for through taxes, or some method other than through adoptive, and prospective adoptive couples.  What she essentially advocates is the abolition of private adoption agencies and making adoption a state-run program.  In my opinion, private adoption would become virtually impossible if it were paid for in this fashion.  I won't digress on the advantages/disadvantages of abolishing private adoption, simply because it isn't going to happen.  Private adoption providers and adoption attorneys, as well as conservative and heavily financed pro-adoption groups like the NCFA aren't going to allow it to happen.  Such groups will lobby legislatures to prevent these changes and possess far more power than those who want them. <br />What I felt after finishing the book is that the author provided some excellent history and background information and addressed an important issue, changing unethical adoption practices.  The book is well-written and its not hard to follow where the author is going.  However, the author's cause, adoption reform, might be better served by being less idealistic and more practical.  Reforms could be accomplished by imposing caps or limitations on fees charged by private agencies (that reflect real costs) and by forcing agencies to itemize to prospective adoptive parents exactly what their money is going for.  Other reforms that are not radical, but would be helpful, include general support for open records laws for adoptees and simply mandating that all adoptions take place through a state licensed agency. (as opposed to facilitators and attorneys doing adoptions).  This is a more modest agenda, which might ultimately be successful....	2001-01-16

The book is lengthy, but well written. For the most part it accurately portrays a public health system which is in shambles in most parts of world.  The book, perhaps, overdramatizes some concerns, but not in a manner that undermines the central premise of the book.<br />Laurie is most successful in pointing out: (1) why public health is important to everyone; (2)the disarray that exists in public health system; (3)The particular threat that is imposed upon the world by the combination of infectious disease and globalization; (4)The fact that unlike other areas of medicine, advances in public health depend acutely on politics and public support for its operations.<br />I found the sections of the book that dealt with antibiotic resistant microbes in strep and staph bacteria diseases to be absolutely chilling.  Right now, even in the USA, there are patients who have died of bacteria that have become resistant to every antibiotic that we have. And the problem continues to get worse.  The problem is exponentially worse in many other countries in the world where antibiotics were used haphazardly and bizarrely by untrained persons attempting to treat diseases. Its a sad state of affairs that should have been dealt with sooner.  It may lead to serious disease epidemics that will kill thousands.<br />The greatest tragedy that Garrett relates in her book is the way that short-sighted politicians and members of the public have slowly and methodically cut the budget for public health endeavors while the threats from infectious diseases have been rising.  All this has occurred against the background of huge increases in spending for medical *treatment* as opposed to prevention, embodied in public health.  <br />At times Garrett fails to give the system credit, where credit isdue.  Effective strategies do exist to contain many diseases and there have been notable public health achievements, such as the eradication of the diseases, small pox and polio, which may not have received enough praise. Even tuberculosis which she speaks of us as being &quot;multi drug resistant&quot; in many patients in many countries, can be cured with aggressive treatment following established protocols.  I would prefer to leave this book with the idea that these problems are fixable with alot of effort and dedication, rather than that &quot;the sky is falling&quot;.<br />Ultimately, though, the book deserves high praise for the provocative and authoritative way that she intelligently discusses problems of immense public interest.  It is without a doubt, one of the best books of the year.<br />                          Markg91359	2001-01-07

Many parents who seek to adopt are told literally hundreds of times that if they are lucky enough to adopt, it may take them many years to do so.  Sometimes we hear this so often it becomes almost a tired mantra.<br />What Wake Up Little Suzie offers is the explanation for why adoption was so prevalent in the 1950's and 1960's and why it disappearing in recent times.  Ricki Sollinger recounts the many pressures on women pregnant out-of-wedlock to relinquish children for adoption in years gone by.  One story that has stayed with me, is the account of a father who rather than admit his daughter was away from home in a home for unwed mothers, instead chose to tell his friends and neighbors she was dead.<br />Ricki than describes birthmother homes which functioned as mechanisms to pry babies out of the reluctant arms of their mothers and into the hands of the adoption industry.  Most of these homes have long since shut down, but they were a fixture of the fifties and the sixties.<br />One of the more shameful (and sickening) aspects of the whole process was the way that non-white and their children were treated.  Unlike white women, they were discouraged from trying to place their children for adoption because they were told that &quot;no one will want your baby&quot;.  Adoption agencies had little use for children other than healthy white infants.<br />Finally, Ricki describes how the sexual revolution of the sixties is what ended the pro-adoption climate.<br />My major criticism of the book is that I think, at times, Ricki offers an incomplete picture.   She talks about how the system coerced women into relinquishing, but fails to deal adequately with the fact that even in these times, fewer than 50% of all women pregnant out of wedlock placed children for adoption.  Despite, the stigma that existed, more women than not endedup keeping their children.  She places too much blame on the adoption industry.  It sometimes seems as though the adoption industry created the entire problem.  In fact, the adoption industry arose because social mores in white middle class America were very much against single white women keeping babies and raising them.  The industry offered an alternative, rather than being part of a conspiracy.<br />Ricki deals little with the role that religion and moral values played in the whole adoption scenario.  Morality and the shame of being pregnant out of wedlock (whether there should have been such shame or not)drove the whole process.<br />I recommend the book because its scathing and accurate portrayal of how the adoption industry functioned in the 1950's and the 1960's is history that no one involved in adoption should ever be allowed to forget.  For adoptive parents like myself, its often painful, but necessary reading.<br />                        Markg91359@aol.com	2000-12-19

Roberts who died in 1933, but attained rank as an LDS General Authority before he died.   B.H. Roberts was the very antithesis of a dogmatic, inflexible, religious  fanatic.  B.H. wrote a great deal throughout his life on the Church.  It  must be remembered that he wrote &quot;The Truth, the Way, the Light&quot;  and a &quot;Comprehensive History of the Church&quot;.  Anyone who reads  the book should make certain they review the introduction written by the  late Sterling McMurrin.  McMurrin points out that B.H. wrote many books  defending the LDS faith and this collection of writings has to be viewed in  the context.  However, after reading &quot;Studies of the Book of  Mormon&quot; one really has to ask what Roberts believed about the Church  when he died.  The answer may not be simple, but in my view its  unimportant.<br />In one series of writings, Robert tries to scientifically  answer questions such as whether horses could have been in the Americas at  the time the Nephites and Jaredites (look in your Book of Mormon) were  supposed to have lived here.  He tries to answer whether steel swords and  metallurgy could have part of the culture in these continents at these  times.  The answers are inconclusive, but strongly suggest  &quot;difficulties&quot; with the Book of Mormon.<br />However, the most  fascinating part of the book is when Roberts attempts to draw parallels  between a book written a few years before the Book of Mormon was translated  (View of the Hebrews) and the Book of Mormon.  The parallels are  interesting, and at times, startling.  He also explores--and answers  affirmatively--the question whether Joseph Smith might have had the  imagination to have written the Book of Mormon<br />In the end, though, one  can't really answer what B.H. Roberts believed towards the end of his life.   However, I concluded that would have made him most happy was the knowledge  that people tried to investigate and answer for themselves, the questions  that he raised.  In that respect, he qualifies as a true scholar who  possessed immense honesty.  He's someone who both Latter Day Saints and  non-Latter Day Saints should admire.	2000-08-17

The author comes through as a bright scholar, a loyal  wife, and a loving mother. In many ways, I was surprised to learn what a  normal and conservative background Fawn had.<br />Fawn was a brilliant young  woman who came from a family of mostly Scottish ancestry who resided in a  small town in Northern Utah, called Huntsville.  Early in her life, Fawn  exhibited signs of great intelligence and precocity.  She skipped many  grades in school, and as I recall, had earned a bachelor's degree from  college when she was 18 years old.  <br />Fawn was able to attend the  University of Chicago in the 1930's and it was there that she did most of  the research for her best-known book &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot;.   A surprising amount of material needed for the book was right there in the  university library.  The thought that crossed my mind, after reading this  book, was that uncovering many of the *problems* she perceived in Joseph  Smith's story was not particularly difficult. One has the impression of  someone who started out as an orthodox Mormon and begins to investigate  various claims one by one.  As she comes across the historical record, she  at first becomes a bit surprised, than startled, and finally reaches  opposite conclusions than the ones she was taught as a child.<br />Fawn  marries Bernard Brodie while at the University of Chicago and creates  something of a scandal in her family by marrying a &quot;Jew&quot;.   However, the two are very gifted people and go on to careers in writing and  teaching at major universities.<br />Fawn's other significant book  &quot;Thomas Jefferson, an Intimate History&quot; upset other groups  because of her conclusions about Jefferson's relationship with his slave,  Sally Hemmings.  However, these conclusions have since been validated by  DNA testing thatestablishes Jefferson did have children with Ms. Hemmings.   Again, we see a pattern.  An author that is unafraid to tackle tough  subjects.<br />I was saddened when Fawn developed lung cancer (she never  smoked) at age 65 and died within a few months.  However, she handled her  last days openly and with as much dignity as someone could under the  circumstances.  I enjoyed this book and found her to be a woman of  courage.<br />                                  Mark	2000-07-25

I was struck by the fact that most of the essays that Mr. Bringhurst  published in this book were generally supportive of Fawn Brodie's  scholarship.  Some questioned certain sections of her book.  <br />One  particularly insightful essay challenged much of what she wrote on the  matter of polygamy as it was being practiced by the Mormons in Nauvoo just  prior to Joseph Smith's murder and subsequent Martyrdom.  The essayist  pointed out that while some of the specific information that Fawn Brodie  may have gathered on this question may have been incorrect, her general  conclusions about the practices going on in Nauvoo, were almost certainly  correct.  This is a particularly difficult issue to investigate.  A secret  practice occurring within a religious organization some 100 years prior to  the time a book is written. It hardly seems surprising that even the best  author might get some of the facts wrong.  Its too Fawn Brodie's credit,  that she got the general picture correct.<br />One essay that I found  disappointing was much ado over nothing.  The writer dealt with certain  literary methods she felt Fawn Brodie used in writing her book.  She  suggested these were the methods of a fiction or literature writer, and not  a historian.  Actually, while Fawn Brodie was a history professor at UCLA,  she got initial college degrees in English and in Literature.  Fawn clearly  had a talent many historians don't.....the ability to write a  well-researched book in a manner that is interesting and readable by people  outside academia.  Something that that particular author that essay  probably lacks herself.<br />Bringhurst himself includes an essay which was  later part of his book on Fawn Brodie, &quot;A Biographer's Life&quot; that  describes Fawn's early life, the immense amount of research and effort she  put into the book,the reaction of the LDS Church to her research efforts,  her attempts to explain the book to her Orthodox LDS family, and her  subsequent excommunication which was probably largely orchestrated by her  uncle, and subsequent President of the LDS Church, David O. McKay.  There  is alot of insightful material here which it would be nice for anyone  reading &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; to be able to examine.<br />Most  of the essays are good.  I recommend this book.	2000-07-21

He than reviews claims of the LDS  Church about the Book of Abraham and compares them with views by modern  Egyptian scholars who have translated the writings.  I was particularly  impressed by the way that Larson documents that Smith included  &quot;Facsimile #1&quot; from the Papyri which are currently in existence,  as material in the Book of Mormon.  Modern Egyptologists hold that both the  facsimile in question, and the writing on that and related sections of the  papyri have absolutely no relationship to the Biblical Prophet Abraham and  instead are part of Egyptian funerary documents that were not created until  centuries after Abraham supposedly lived.<br />Equally impressive is the way  that Larson reviews the rebuttal that LDS authorities and scholars have  made to the claim that the papyri have nothing to do with Abraham.  No less  than eight separate theories have been postulated to account for why  Abraham's text cannot be found anywhere on the papyri.  One by one, Larson  disposes of most of these claims.  One cannot help but think that those  arguing in favor of the authenticity of the Book of Abraham couldn't have  done a better job making consistent arguments, before they allowed all  eight of these to go into print.  Interestingly, while continuing to insist  the Book of Abraham is scripture, the LDS Church takes no official position  on which of any of these theories may be the explanation for why the papyri  that exist don't contain Abraham's words.<br />     I don't like the way that  Larson shifts gears at the end of the book from a very professional  examination of the Book of Abraham to arguing the case for Christianity,  but this is more than offset by his use of logic and evidence to shed real  light on the questionable origins of the Book of Abraham.	2000-07-21
