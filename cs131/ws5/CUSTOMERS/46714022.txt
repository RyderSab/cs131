All these poems were written by inmates in the Virginia prison system. As with any collection of poems, some are better than others but one thing they all have in common. Each of these poems comes straight from the heart.<br /><br />As you read through these pieces you will feel the pain and the guilt these inmates live with every day but most of all you will feel the hope. It is hope that this collection is really all about. Hope for the present and the future but, mainly, hope for the soul.<br /><br />Included in this collection is a short autobiographical piece by David Berkowitz, the Son Of Sam. The story of how he went from serial killer to servant of Christ is truly inspirational.<br /><br />This book is not just for prison inmates. We have all felt, at one time or another, that we were in bondage. We have all felt trapped; by family and friends, by emotions, by circumstances beyond our control. For anyone who has ever felt walled in by life this book delivers a powerful message of hope and release.	2005-08-23

They compliment each other perfectly, covering each other's weaknesses and amplifying each other's strengths. They make the best team in the Thousand World Contract Service.<br /><br />They are in the business of making first contact with alien species. They hold the power to welcome a friendly species into the galactic community or to completely shut off a hostile species. What constitutes `friendly' or `hostile' is completely dependent on the interpretation of Emile and the Dutchman.<br /><br />Any book with Joel Rosenberg's name on the cover is guaranteed to be good but this one is different from any of his others. This one is not so much a novel as it is a collection of short stories. In a series of six different stories, all tied together by the two main characters, Rosenberg weaves a tapestry of action and adventure.<br /><br />Half military adventure and half coming of age story, Emile And The Dutchman is sure to please not only Joel Rosenberg's loyal fans but any fan of sci-fi.	2005-08-23

It tells the story of a massive earth quake which supposedly knocked California off into the ocean in 1969. Yeah, it sounds like it has the potential to be a good story. That's what made me pick it up.<br /><br />Alas, the book is dry and unexciting. It reads like a history book, and since it is a history of an event which never happened, it really isn't at all interesting.<br /><br />There are no main characters, so the reader has no one with which to identify. What story there is, is told in brief and disconnected pieces as if the book were a collection of newspaper and magazine articles. Perhaps this was meant to lend a sense of reality to the story but it doesn't work.<br /><br />In short, this book is a failure. It fails on so many levels that it would take another book to list all the shortcomings. Do yourself a favor. Skip this one.	2005-08-19

Time after time we find the same basic stories.  Gods came down from the stars in great, fiery chariots. These gods taught primitive barbarians how to build a civilization, gave them a set of rules or `commandments' concerning proper behavior, then returned to the stars with the promise that they wouldn't be gone forever.<br /><br />Why do so many ancient civilizations have cultural similarities? Time and again we encounter records showing that this or that dead empire knew more about math or astronomy than we do today. Pyramids are not exclusively Egyptian. Nor are mummies. Both have been found on nearly every continent. Pyramids around the world show similar advanced architecture and mummies often show similar methods of preparation.<br /><br />Did all these ancients have some way of communicating with each other? Unlikely. So how did all these prehistoric cultures come to bear such resemblance to each other, as if they al had the same influence or inspiration? Perhaps they did all share the same source of inspiration.<br /><br />Erich Von Daniken suggests that those gods in their fiery chariots were, in reality, advanced beings from other worlds. Yes, this is an old idea, maybe even a tired old concept. But this book was published in 1969 and this was a fairly new idea back then. And Daniken argues his case quite convincingly. Bit by bit, piece by piece, he presents his evidence and clearly ties it all together into a conclusion which is hard to refute.<br /><br />Is it science fiction or science fact? Decide for yourself. One thing is certain. There are many questions about our human history that need to be answered. The answers Erich Von Daniken presents may or may not be right but they are certainly thought provoking.	2005-07-18

Even the worst of his books are better than the best some other writers can come up with. Red Thunder is no exception. Once again Varley has proven that, even though he doesn't write often, he has the power to deliver a bombshell in each book.<br /><br />In Red Thunder we have the story of our first manned mission to Mars. What makes this tale different from so many other stories about flights to Mars is the cast of characters Varley has peopled this tale with. There are no astronauts here. Red Thunder is a private ship built and piloted by a bunch of Florida rednecks who took matters into their own hands. Set in the very near future, this is a story of regular people just like the rest of us. It is so easy to relate to Varley's characters because the reader can see him or herself doing exactly the same things in these circumstances. Varley makes a trip to Mars look easy. He makes it look like it is within our grasp.<br /><br />There is a reason John Varley won both the Nebula and the Hugo awards. He has a way of writing that makes the reader forget that there is even a book involved. Reading a Varley novel is as easy as sitting back and watching a movie. The words flow off the page with so little effort that it is never anything less than a pleasure to read his work. When the last page is turned the reader is tempted to stand up and applaud.<br /><br />In writing about this book I have to admit that I am tempted to write pages and pages of tedious \\"review type\\" stuff. I want to hit all the good points and all the bad points and wax poetic about this incredible book that I just finished reading. But let's face facts. There are no bad points to mention and to go through all the good points would take a book nearly as big as the novel in question. And since I'm not half the writer that Varley is I'll just have to tell you to read Red Thunder for yourself. You will not be disappointed. Trust me on this. If you read science fiction and you haven't read Varley yet, then you are missing out. If you are not a fan of sci-fi, then Varley may very well change your mind.

Simply put, if your questions aren't answered by this book then the task at hand is probably one which you should leave to a professional anyway. Having said that I will still say that 99% of your home related troubles will be solved right between the pages of this book. You wouldn't go sky diving without a parachute and, likewise, you should not own a home without this book.	2003-04-22

You know it, I know it. We've all known about it for years. But what most Americans are not aware of is the full extent of the problem.<br />  In Bias, Bernard Goldberg shows us over and over just how the Media does it. From subtle manipulations to outright dissemination of misinformation the Network Media adds a left handed touch to nearly every story they cover.<br />  Mr. Goldberg, of course, has his own bias but he works hard to approach his subject from a neutral angle. He succeeds marvelously. It is only in the first chapter where a slight touch of bitterness over his misfortunes shows through. After that the book becomes a hard edged analysis of media misrepresentation. His opinions are backed by facts and statistics which you will never see on the evening news. His sources include everyone from the C.D.C. to the Census Bureau and his conclusions are based firmly in reality.<br />  All in all, I found this book to be very enlightening. And remember, this is a book which the Media Giants really don't want you to read. What better endorsement can a book have?	2002-10-11

At long last we have proof that God exists and the race is on to take revenge on the supreme maker of life, death, and cheap whiskey. The edgeman Alix is the favored to win as he sidesteps through time and space on his quest to drive the bullet home. God is the target, Alix is the gun, and the stakes are high as the very existence of humanity perches on the cusp of oblivion. Steve Aylett has created a masterwork of speculative fiction written in a hybrid English perhaps best described as Cyberspeak. The book is fast paced and unrelenting and it keeps the reader riveted right to the last page. Read this book and prepare to be dazzled and dazed and altered on a cellular level. `Shamanspace' isn't so much taken in through the eyes as it is injected into the veins. This book is a drug delivered on a dirty needle. It will leave you mind-blown and wasted and craving still more.	2002-04-13

One would expect better from Piers Anthony but, with Firefly, Anthony does not deliver. Everything is too easy in this book. The characters leap to conclusions with no real logical means of doing so. Things seem to simply be presented to them. The characters don't really have to work very hard to find the answers to their questions. Everything just falls in their laps. I was monumentally disappointed in this book. Piers Anthony has written some wonderful books in the past but this is not one of them. Perhaps he has spent too much time in Xanth where things are expected to come easy and he has forgotten how to write a grown up novel. Too bad.	2002-04-11
US	46714022	R2M33FPEOTVXK3	031286857X	546958481	Bios	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Traditional SF	Set in the far future, in the far reaches of the galaxy, Bios is an unusual tale. Unlike so many other stories of human settlement on foreign planets this time we have a planet which just doesn't seem to want us there. This is not simply a wild west story set among the stars. With Bios, Robert Charles Wilson has not given us a tale of settlers getting to know their new home so much as he has given us a tale of a new home getting to know it's settlers. The planet Isis is hostile and toxic and it wants very much to break through the protective seals the invading humans have built around their outposts. It tries and tries again to get through and it learns from its past failures. Little by little it makes headway in its quest to oust the humans. But is Isis really a vindictive force out to get us or is it merely curious? And what secrets does this distant planet hold about our own nature? In the end, Bios is not so much about a journey to the stars as it is about a journey into and beyond ourselves. And what an ending it has! Robert Charles Wilson gives his readers a real kick of a surprise at the close of this book. This is sci-fi in the old tradition. This is a book that has something to say. It has all the flash and glitter we expect from the genre but it also has that underlying message that characterizes true SF. I'm glad I read this and I would recommend Bios to anyone in search of a good read.	2002-04-11

He loved the action and the shear power of the men who fought between the ropes. This respect for manly strength shows in every story he wrote, from his westerns right up to his most famous creation, Conan. Here in this book he writes about the real thing. These are men here. Real men! Howard was a life time fan of boxing and these stories are based on men he actually watched trading blows in the ring. If you think these men are larger than life, think again. For each fictional character found in this book there was a real man behind the character. Real men lived the lives presented here. While it is true that these are fictitious accounts it is also true that boxing really was once like this. It was brutal. It was bloody. It was all about fighting. The boxers of today, with their polish and their fancy footwork would not have had a chance in the boxing ring of old. Only an iron man could get through a match in those days. An iron man was a man who didn't duck and dodge but, rather, took each blow to come his way and never faltered. An iron man could take any amount of punishment and still win the fight. An iron man was the toughest of the tough. In this book you will find four such men. These are the men who inspired the great barbarian, Conan. Read this book and enjoy, but beware. No matter how tough you think you are you will feel weak and helpless compared to the giants found in these pages. This is Howard at his best. This is Howard writing about that which he loved most. This is The Iron Man!	2002-03-06

It is now time to rebuild the devastated city of Isis. Along with a host of new characters, Whit and Kali work to rebuild what was lost. But there is trouble brewing in Freeland as old demons from the past resurface in the budding colony of Isis. From small mishaps to major tragedies things are going wrong and there seems to be no explanation as to why. Whit, Kali, and their friends must solve the mystery if they are ever to build the city of their dreams. It is a struggle right from the start and it just gets worse as time goes on. But amidst all the turmoil the reader is allowed to watch the love between Whit and Kali grow and deepen as the two mature and find their true place in the world. As was the first book, this is a love story posing as a sci-fi novel. All the action takes the focus off the underlying truths about love. As you read this book you will be caught up in the action, you're heartbeat will quicken, but you will have an inexplicable warm and fuzzy feeling deep inside! Jean Stewart combines action and warmth here with such skill and finesse. She is a master of the craft and I, for one, hope she never stops writing!	2002-03-06

By taking us on a tour of his own past Stephenson takes us on a tour of our country's past as well. This is what America used to be all about and what it should still be about. This is a book about family and the friends we have around us as we grow. I could not put this delightful little book down. It held me captivated from beginning to end.

This is a wonderful book and I can't recommend it highly enough. I couldn't put it down. I was captivated from the first page right up to the last. The plot was entirely believable and the action never slowed down. Even if you're not a fan of medical thrillers I'm sure you'll like this book. It has all the ingredients of greatness. This is a story that the reader will remember long after finishing the book.<br />Dr. Peter Pavano is a young doctor just getting started out on a bright career when he runs up against the wrong people. Or perhaps it's they who ran up against the wrong young doctor! It soon becomes apparent that the bad guys have met their match in this fellow. Dr. Pavano is forced to confront a very powerful organization set on destroying all he has worked to achieve. It's kill or be killed and the young doctor quickly decides he's not going to lose this fight. He is helped along on his quest by a great cast of supporting characters who bring such color to the story! And talk about bad guys! Not since Darth Vader has there been a more black hearted villain than Pavano's nemesis at the Connecticut General Hospital. You won't want to miss this book.	2002-02-09

In all of his stories there is the common theme of the barbarian against the world. He had a fascination with strong heroes. All of his characters are larger than life and here is more of the same. What makes this book so special is simply that it is one of the few of his works still in print. It is certainly a crime that it should be so hard to come by the stories of the father of sword and sorcery. Why this is I can't say. At any rate, this book is still a good volume to have. It is not his best work but it is a good representation of what Howard was all about. The characters in `Bran Mak Morn' are all bold and unforgiving. They are tough. They are men! Real men. None are so tough and terrible as the title character himself. Bran may not be as big and hulking as Conan but he is made of the same iron and steel. I would urge every fantasy fan to buy this book at once.  Just as archeologists dig through the bones of ages past to see why the people of today do the things they do, so should you spend a little time digging through the fiction of ages past to see why the writers of today write what they write. This is the bare bones of the fantasy genre. Without Robert E. Howard and a few of his lesser known contemporaries today's fantasy would be nothing more than silly little fairy tales with no depth, no meat, no excitement. Give this book a try, you'll be glad you did.	2001-10-03

The truth is this. He was one of the greatest writers of science fiction ever published. Books like Battlefield Earth are a testament to the talent of this man. And then there is Typewriter In The Sky. This is a magnificently funny book! The lead character, Mike de Wolf, finds himself transported into a novel being written by a friend. Here he is known as Miguel de Lobo and he quickly learns that he is not to be cast as the hero. Knowing that the villain must die in the end Mike has to find some way to stay alive in a world that is chock full of anachronisms and stereotypes. He must find a way to outsmart the author who is unknowingly guiding his fate. And he must do it while staying within the parameters of the character he has been cast into.

In 'Return To Isis' Jean Stewart has given the reader a stirring tale of love found in a world where women have carved out a splendid society for themselves. Called Freeland it is a land of modern amazons. They live, they love, they work together to create the kind of civilization that we can only dream about here in the real world. It is a society built on love and freedom. It is idyllic. And yet it does have its problems for right next door to Freeland  can be found Elysium, a land still ruled by men. Elysium is the hell to Freeland's heaven. 'Return To Isis' tells the story of one woman's escape from Elysium and her struggle to find a home in Freeland where she is thought to be a spy at best and at worst a traitor. Unaccustomed to the freedom of her new home Amelia must look deep into her self and her soul, she must dig through long buried memories, she must find allies and defeat enemies, and she must come to grips with the truth of who she really is on her quest to find peace. Guiding her on this quest is the hardened warrior woman Whit whose own troubled soul paradoxically gives Amelia just the foundation she needs to succeed in this new land she has come to. Toss in to the mix a jilted ex-lover, a wise and motherly matriarch, and a plotting and suspicious captain and 'Return To Isis' becomes a fully rounded and well thought out novel of a future that very well may be better than any we can realistically hope for. I for one would love to live in such a world.	2001-10-01

Not To Be Missed	\\"The Absence Of Nectar\\" is by far the most gripping novel it has been my pleasure to read in a very long time! No one person should have this much talent. It's unfair to the rest of us. This is a truly remarkable novel. Once the story grabs you it will not let you go, and it grabs you right from the start. The characters are entirely believable and the plot is all too real. In writing a review I do try to sound like a professional but I am just too excited about this book. I don't know where to start. It's been more than a week now since I've finished reading but, still, the story haunts me. I would say to anyone interested in reading this book that you must be prepared for many twists and turns. Just when you think you've got it figured out more clues crop up to let you know that you've got it all wrong. The story turns around the life of Alice and her brother, Boone, and their stepfather, Simon. Throw in a wonderfully written crazy girl named Persely just to stir things up and you have one of the best books ever written. The ending came as a complete surprise and, yet, it couldn't have ended any other way. It all fits together so splendidly.<br /><br />Kathy Hepinstall has given the reader a good character driven novel about a truly dysfunctional family. The narrator, twelve year old Alice, is not a typical heroine. She is the kind of young girl who should be narrating a book for children and yet, here, she is forced to deal with scary adult themes. She does it all too well. Her tale revolves around herself and her brother and their fear of their stepfather. Is their fear justified? Perhaps. Perhaps not. You must read the book to find out. \\"The Absence Of Nectar\\" is a fascinating look into the lives of some truly unforgettable characters. Their story is by turns chilling, heartrending, and humorous. The book is fast paced, easy to read, and thoroughly enjoyable. I can not recommend this book highly enough. I give it five stars only because I am not able to give it six.six.	2001-09-12

It is the story of wheel chair bound Sheila and her best friend Maud. Maud is everything that Sheila wishes she could be. Or is she? This is a story of role reversals where we learn that the weak and totally dependant girl in the wheel chair has strengths that we all wish we might possess, while the strong and beautiful ones may not be as enviable as we would first think. \\"The Cloths Of Heaven\\" takes the reader through much of Sheila's life, from childhood to adulthood. It tells of her losses and her victories and teaches a grand lesson about what it really means to be alive. Sheila's determination to overcome her disability is an inspiration to one and all. Geraldine Nesbitt has given us all a wonderful book for which we should all be thankful. What a great story!	2001-09-12

Not Really	Marketed as a &quot;fun-loving scientific thriller&quot; Laser Streak is niether scientific nor thrilling. It can't really even be said to be fun. What starts out to be an exciting story about an unmanned mission to Alpha Centauri and Jupiter quickly becomes the story of three men in a small control room discussing business theory. The three fellows talk about merchandising, marketing, manufacturing costs and various other aspects of big business. Their discussion has nothing to do with the mission they are supposed to be monitoring. Indeed, the book itself has nothing to do with the mission. Laser Streak comes to us from Kenneth Musser, who holds a master's degree in business administration and yet even the business tips he brings us are the most basic of concepts. It's not at all clear what Musser is trying to do with this story or where he is trying to take the reader. What is clear is that this book is a fine example of what happens when the editor sleeps on the job. So, what is good about this book? Well, Kenneth Musser does have a flair for dialogue. What little there is of value in this book can be found in Musser's use of language. He knows how to use his characters to tell the story. I do have high hopes for Musser. In Laser Streak, Musser has tried to combine his love of science fiction with his love of business. I suspect that were he to concentrate on one or the other he might just produce a very good book. Unfortunately, this is not that book. Try again Kenneth.	2001-08-17
