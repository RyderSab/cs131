Dr. Fisher's name is not new at all for those who follow and pursue research on higher education administration and the aspects of the presidency. This book is a sort of update of his previous book \\"Effective College President\\"  but in addition, Dr. Fisher and Dr. Koch enriched it with statistical data pertaining to the presidents and their performance. The book is a Bible for those who are in the office of president of any college or university. I strongly advise this book to everyone who is engaged in the field or makes a research on the presidency of higher education.	2004-08-22

I have been very lucky to get this book right from the author. I have been an ardent reader of Dr. Birnbaum's books. But this one turned out to be somnething that every person, - more or less related to higher education and its fields, must have longed and waited. You may find all the quotations from the beginning of the US Higher Education history to the present date. You will find here the quotes from the distinguished presidents of the most prominent universities and their views, perceptions and thoughts. The book is fabulously organized and covers all the fields of the higher education. It is a must-have-book for everyone - even for the present, incumbent presidents and deans and for those who think they may find themselves in that position, or someone who is interested in the system of the field. One will be amused by some humorous quotes and you will stay up till late night before you decide it is time to close the book. You will come to the last page and then go back to the front page and start anew. I really enjoyed reading this book. It is rather a compendium, encyclopaedia and great reference that has been missing from our shelves. Thanks to the author for his efforts.	2004-04-25

I will start by saying that I have to admit that I am biased while writing this review as I have been a Reagan admirer and fan for more than two decades. Especially, I am NOT an American citizen! I am from Georgia,  one of the constituent republics of the former Soviet Union, i.e. Evil Empire and belong to the millions who were liberated by this Cowboy President. President Reagan is a true hero and his values, his vision and his voice always reached us. This books will absorb you by its contents and fabulous pictures. There is also an interesting thing that you will notice -  the book will remind you of the published version of some video titles about Ronald Reagan!! I have every video titles about him and never get tired by watching them! Buy this book and you will be absorbed by the vision, values and goals he had set as objectives when he came to the office. You will also share the humor he always had. I have many books about him and some of them are illustrated but none of them is so exhaustive as this one. I am truly appreciative of the work the Reagan Foundation has done to publish this book. It is NOT honoring just our beloved President, it is honoring US - by keeping us aware of what we are and what we happened not to become. We got rid of so many tragedies and catasrophs, just because there was always a man who never was afraid of bear!! Thank YOU Mr. President and Thank you for those wonderful things you envisioned!!! Thank you for your ideals, for your vision and your everlasting optimism.	2001-07-07

I got this book on my birthday, which is on February 7, one day later that of Ronald Reagan himself. I am amazed how James Spada got all those pictures in this one volume book. I am amazed at his comments. You got the feeling that he was next to him. President's assassination attempt and his Golden State retirements pictures are also here. BUT BE ADVISED: Unlike other books, this are BLACK AND WHITE pictures. If you are looking for the color pictures, go and buy 'REMEMBERING REAGAN' and 'UNGUARDED MOMENTS.'You will be able to compensate the color phenomenon. I would like to see another book like this one but only in color pictures. All in all, the book is great and the author should be recognized for his efforts. I hope he will start another project and we shall see the color one. You won't be upset as you will see wonderful pictures of President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan.	2001-02-15

Nor this is for the historians to check some facts about the couple. The book is for every generation and most especially for the future generation who have become very indifferent to real love and affection. You will find Mrs. Ronald Reagan's comments in between the President's letters. I read the book now for several times and everytime I get tired and bored, I go to this book and the other one - &quot;Reagan: In His Own Hand.&quot; I truly suggest to get these two books and you will have a wonderful set. The First Couple are shown here at full length - how they advocated the principles of the genuine family and American ideals. Do not hesitate - go and get this book!!!!! I also would recommend some video titles &quot;Reagan&quot; and &quot;Tribute to Ronald Reagan.&quot; If your budget allows you, get &quot;RONALD REAGAN, A GREAT COMMUNICATOR&quot; as well!!! You will have a wonderful present for the 21st century American generation. They should know all about the Man, the Leader, the President and the Lifeguard who saved the lives of billions. So sad that many liberals take his merits and efforts and the results of them for granted, but so great that He is still so well-remembered around the world as we are in debt before Him. God Bless Mr. and Mrs.Ronald Reagan and God Bless the United States of America, the Proud Nation!	2001-02-12

I am recommending the book to everyone who is interested in the organizational paradigms within the higher educational institutions.

I am from another part of the world and I did enjoy reading of the book and found many common with the ideal leadrship design everywhere in the world. If you are really into business of higher education administrationa dnare thinking about your unievsrity, you'd better get the book and read it thoroughly. I have been just 'collecting' the books about CEOs of American universities and this book is another bright constituent of my library. I would grade the book with 10 stars as it is a must for everyone involved in this business. Dr. Clark is the person who endured the troubled times of American higher education and he experienced it himself. So, the book is not written by someone for whom this business may seem just a theoretical judgment, it is rather sharing your thoughts with a practician who occupied the seat of the president for many years at one of America's biggest universities at one of the most troubled times in the US history.	2000-10-03
