US	52603767	R3JXP4C5DE6D8I	0552997048	997649583	A Short History of Nearly Everything (Bryson)	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Science for the verbally-minded	This is a remarkable book in two ways. It's a very clear, comprehensive summary and explanation of our current understanding across a wide range of scientific subjects. It's also the only science book I've ever read with almost no illustrations or equations. <br /> <br />In his introduction Bryson complains that he could not get interested in science at school because all the text books were dull. Admittedly I'm a few years younger, which might make a difference, but I was exposed from an early age to a vast array of well-written and beautifully-illustrated books on a range of science subjects. The conclusion is simple: unlike most who get interested in science, Bill Bryson is one of those people whose thinking is almost entirely verbal in nature, and he's written a book for those of the same persuasion. And he's done a very good job of it. <br /> <br />If you have a passing familiarity with most of the topics the book's clear prose will refresh and add to your knowledge, but I do wonder whether those without much background will be able to successfully visualise the subjects. On the other hand his insistence on writing out large numbers in words or with all the zeros might soothe the fears of the mathematically inexperienced, but is plain annoying if you're happy with scientific notation. <br /> <br />Honouring its title, the book covers an impressive amount of ground. A very well structured journey takes us through cosmology, geology, palaeontology, chemistry, physics, meteorology, biology, evolution and extinction, genetics and the emergence of mankind. The topics are split so that the walk is roughly chronological, both in respect of the target time frame, and also in respect of the development of scientific understanding, a clever feat. <br /> <br />Throughout Bryson explains all the key ideas, focusing more on those which have stood the test of time. But his real interest is the scientists, especially the more interesting ones - the eccentric, sociopathic anddishonest. His thumbnail sketches of important scientists are very entertaining, and are one of the books' best features. <br /> <br />I didn't spot any significant errors, and where informed opinion differs the author explains this openly, and usually in a very amusing way. He draws a clear contrast between the overweening \\"we know almost everything\\" of the late Victorians, to the acknowledged gaps in our knowledge a century later. As a result you get a very clear, balanced view of where we are now. <br /> <br />If you're looking for step-by-step prose and big, clear pictures, look elsewhere. But if you want a walk through science with one of the masters of clear, concise and amusing verbal explanation, I can thoroughly recommend this book.	2005-08-16

It's a very comprehensive book, which goes beyond mere patterns to introduce the reader to a wide range of topics in the world of messaging. It forms a strong and useful counterpart to the many more general books on architecture patterns, for example Martin Fowler's \\"Enterprise Architecture Patterns\\" in the same series. <br /> <br />The book is very accessible, written and illustrated clearly and assuming very little initial knowledge. However it will also provide value to the experienced messaging developer, formalising his or her knowledge and suggesting new ways of using messaging to solve different problems. I particularly like the way that Hohpe and Woolfe lay out each pattern using language and visual styles to naturally delimit the sections of the pattern, rather than using lots of sub-headings. This increases the readability significantly. <br /> <br />Several books on patterns talk about a \\"pattern language\\", the idea of describing a complete design in terms of named patterns for the architectural form of each component. However this is one of the first books I have read which really adopt this idea - the authors have created a new visual language, which they first use to describe basic patterns in terms of basic message constructs, and then describe more complex patterns and solutions using the icons for the intermediate patterns. Best of all you can download a Visio stencil from the website and start using and extending the pattern language yourself. <br /> <br />The book is remarkably technology-agnostic, providing many examples in both .NET and Java forms, and with a fair sprinkling of other technologies, for example using proprietary EAI tools such as Tibco. I have certainly seen and used some of these patterns in older file-based integration schemes, and I suspect many of them work for Web Services too. As such the book has a much better claim to be a true \\"patterns\\" book than one wedded solely to a single technology base.  <br /> <br />Each group of pattern descriptions is followed by a detailed \\"practical example\\" section which shows how one or more messaging technologies can implement the preceding patterns to solve real problems. There aren't any real \\"antipatterns\\" in the book, but the book is realistic about when a given technology or pattern should not be used, which is just as valuable. <br /> <br />If I have a complaint it's a minor one, that the book is too long. Including the multiple introductions, it runs to over 700 pages. Dipping in and out my read through has taken many months. Like many patterns books, in an attempt to keep each description self-contained you find by half-way through that some basic things are being repeated regularly. A more \\"normalised\\" structure might have been better. Also, although most of the book is very readable, a couple of chapters by \\"guest\\" authors, including the final one on Web Service standards, take a more academic tone. <br /> <br />That said, this is an excellent book, which can be read from cover to cover, or stands as a general-purpose reference, and I strongly recommend it.	2005-07-24

I expected the familiar story of our greatest leader's early life, I expected an insightful account of Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, I expected a stirring tale of a young man who was a practical adventurer just as much as politician and author. I didn't expect to laugh out loud regularly for much of the story.  <br /> <br />If you've seen the film \\"Young Winston\\", based on this book, you will be familiar with some of the events. Other programmes and books have adequately explained his war leadership and his contribution to many serious political issues. However, the films and documentaries I have seen fail to capture the mischievous spirit communicated through this book.  <br /> <br />This a fascinating study of a bygone age, when Britain maintained a great empire, when most politicians took the title Lord, and when politics and army officership were sports for those of independent means. Interestingly despite his aristocratic bloodline Churchill's family was not particularly wealthy and some of the most poignant lessons stem from this.  <br /> <br />Sometimes the sentiments in the book appear bloodthirsty or imperialistic, but you have to realise that at least part of the time Churchill is writing satirically, reflecting common values which you suspect he did not always share himself. When he is sincerely expressing his own serious ideals it is usually easy to detect.  <br /> <br />These beliefs link both his skilful analysis of historical events, and Churchill's account of his own development. For example he explains the British government's failure to be magnanimous after the early victories of the Boer war as the reason that a relatively fast-moving and honourable conflict descended into \\"shocking evils\\" on both sides. The same failing is shown as a prime force in the leftward drift of Churchill's own politics.  <br /> <br />Churchill was a great writer, but it's instructive to learn that his facility with English developed largely because he was judged early on to be too dim to cope with Latin and Greek. The classics loss was our gain, the legacy including both Churchill's great deeds and great writing.  <br /> <br />The last chapter is slightly disappointing, with Churchill's early parliamentary career an anticlimax, and the story stops rather than ending on a major event. That apart, the pace, interest and humour are consistent throughout.  <br /> <br />This book was written in 1930, when Churchill was already 56, but in the \\"wilderness years\\" before he regained high office and led Britain through the Second World War. It is interesting to speculate whether the book would have been very different if it were written either much earlier or later.  <br /> <br />If you want adventure, read this book. If you want to understand a great man, read this book. If you want to do both and have a good laugh, read this book. <br />	2005-05-18

I was hoping for something which could help explain to business managers why processes such as IT delivery are uncertain, and the value of delivering flexible solutions. The initial part of the book makes a lot of strong qualitative statements of exactly the right sort: <br />- There is great value in breaking up large projects in uncertain markets <br />- Options (flexibility) create value out of uncertain events. <br />- Exit options which allow you to step away from a planned path, even if relatively expensive, may have significant value. <br />- An option such as an exit option, can make an investment viable when it would fail a traditional NPV test.  <br />- Small speculative investments can enable larger investments to benefit from learning and to be much more accurately targeted. <br />- It may create greater value to start many projects and abandon more, rather than aiming to abandon a minimum number. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the remainder of the book then supports these statements only for a very limited set of circumstances. The Real Options approach only seems to work if the option can be translated into (or at least mapped onto) a tradeable financial security. There's no real attempt to provide tools to evaluate internal uncertainty, such as the delivery uncertainty common in IT  projects, or the value of flexibility except where it maps to significant investment decisions. <br /> <br />The book does do a good job of explaining that real world situations are non-linear, with value which changes as a result of natural volatility, over time, and as a result of one or more decisions. Traditional NPV-based approaches greatly undervalue flexibility, insurance, learning and platform investments, and can't really deal with this non-linear aspect. Simply increasing the investment discount rate, which is the usual way of dealing with such problems, doesn't bring the correct focus onto uncertainty and total risk. <br /> <br />However, the mathematical basis for Real Option valuation is not well explained, and I found the processes difficult to follow. I suspect that the authors implicitly assumed a certain familiarity with economic and financial market techniques and terminology, which limits the value of this book to those seeking, as I was, to apply the techniques to other fields. It also left me puzzled as to why simpler approaches, such as Decision Tree techniques, can't be used instead. <br /> <br />Surprisingly for a relatively short book the text is very repetitive, and too often turns into a blatant advert for the Real Options approach compared with others, rather than making the case on its own merits.  <br /> <br />Hindsight is a great thing, but it is unfortunate that this book praises Enron as an example of success through options manipulation, where we now know this was largely a \\"long company\\" scam. Some of the other examples, quoted at the height of the Internet boom, have also not stood the test of time. However, these should not be seen as invalidating the approach, merely as evidence of how uncertain things may really be. <br /> <br />This book provides some good ideas, and if your focus is major business-critical financial transactions it may be very useful. But I'm still looking for a good book on how to generically value flexibility. <br />	2005-05-02

While the earlier book focused on those annoying little mysteries of life, this asks a set of different questions, many related to tough decisions such as how conmen get rich, or \\"should I phone a friend?\\"  <br /> <br />The answers, like before, lead us through a gentle, humorous exploration of mathematics and its relevance to everyday life. Along the way we explore (among others) geometric progression (why all pyramid schemes eventually fail), the geometry of stacking, fractals, chaos theory, the mathematics behind taxi meters, and various uses and abuses of statistics, both to detect and commit fraud. <br /> <br />The two messages of this book are that mathematics is important, and that it's fun. It's in the same vein as the work of Martin Gardener, but with a British slant.  <br /> <br />To aid casual readers or those who've previously found the subject forbidding the maths is kept at a fairly simple level. Most of the time the concepts are communicated in words and simple graphs, but key equations are included and explained for completeness. The text is easy to read and the illustrations clear and amusing. Although aimed at those new to the enjoyment of maths, it's also a good memory jogger for those with a bit more background.  <br /> <br />I thoroughly recommend this book, and also the authors' earlier volume. <br />	2005-03-28

Like the earlier books of Martin Gardener, this book aims to make mathematics relevant and accessible, but with a British rather than American slant. <br />  <br />Have you ever wondered why flowers often have five petals, how bookies' odds work, how you always end up in the slowest queue, or, indeed, why buses come in threes? If so, then this is the book for you.  <br /> <br />In the course of a humorous, chatty discourse on the mysteries of life the authors introduce a number of branches of mathematics, including probability, topology, statistics and queuing theory, to name just a few.  <br /> <br />To aid casual readers or those who've previously found the subject forbidding the maths is kept at a fairly simple level. However there's still enough detail to be useful in other applications. I used this book as a reminder when trying to solve a problem related to software performance, and others who don't exercise their maths every day might also find it a useful memory jogger.  <br /> <br />Whether as an introduction if you've never enjoyed maths before, or a reminder if you have, I thoroughly recommend this book. I can also recommend the companion volume \\"How Long is a Piece of String?\\" <br />	2005-03-28

Unlike the school librarian I treasured those books, which presented hard science in a humorous, accessible way, and learned a lot from them. <br /> <br />George Gamow brought his original material up to date for \\"Mr Tompkins in Paperback\\" shortly before his death in 1968. However, since then Physics has moved on still further, and a new update was appropriate. Russell Stannard took on the challenge, and has done a superb job. <br /> <br />The new version brings both the science and the charming human back story fully up to date, and also addresses some inconsistencies in the earlier text and illustrations caused by their derivation from a group of separate magazine articles. <br />The books tackles all the main areas of modern Physics, from relativity to particle physics. Each topic is presented by both a serious (but straightforward) lecture text, and also by analogies in a dream experienced by one off the main characters. The two reinforce one another, and should leave the reader with a good basic understanding of all the key concepts. Familiarity with basic arithmetic and elementary concepts of classical physics are the only prerequisites, but the text should also be enjoyable for those with greater background knowledge. <br /> <br />I am very glad to see this classic developed for a new generation, and thoroughly recommend it.	2004-09-19
US	52603767	RP2OCKMPFZXM7	0671041916	179618738	The Coming Global Superstorm	Books	3	9	11	N	N	A good book, slightly spoilt by psueo-science	This book, which sired the recent blockbuster \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\", is a well-written and accessible analysis of how global warming may lead to not gradual but catastrophic climate change, potentially destroying much of our current civilisation. Given how the powerful fossil fuel lobby, led by the current US administration, seems determined to ignore such risks to ensure their own short-term profits, it is essential that books such as this exist and are able to present a discussion of wider considerations. <br /> <br />The core of the book is a straightforward presentation of the known facts about global warming, its measured effects on the polar ice sheets, and how that may indirectly cause the failure of the Gulf Stream plunging much of the northern hemisphere into a much colder climate. Worryingly some early warning signs suggest that this may already be starting. <br /> <br />The book then presents a combination of scientific explanations and fictionalised accounts which suggest that such change might not be gradual, but might take the form of a protracted global storm of several weeks' duration and unprecedented ferocity. If this happened in the summer the aftermath would be flooding of biblical proportions. If it happened during the winter it would plunge the world into another ice age. <br /> <br />The authors quote recent scientific evidence suggesting that exactly this happened towards the end of the last ice age, and suggest that the physical evidence is supported by this being an explanation for the biblical flood, a myth shared by many separate cultures. <br /> <br />If the book focused only on these areas it would deliver a clear, powerful message. Unfortunately the authors weaken their message somewhat by also trying to link in some pseudo-scientific stuff about a lost civilisation destroyed by the last such event sending us a message through the zodiac. This is based on the totally discredited ideas of people like Graham Hancock, and sadly taintswhat is otherwise a reasonable extension of current mainstream science with an unworthy \\"lunatic fringe\\" component. <br /> <br />It would have been better to structure the book starting with a very direct account of the proven science, leading into a well-marked extrapolation discussing the \\"superstorm\\" concept (using both factual and fictional elements), and ending with the excellent \\"what can we do\\" sections. All the pseudo-science rubbish should have been dumped. This would have created a work whose important ideas would have been much more widely appreciated. <br /> <br />I recommend this book, but encourage other readers to apply the filtering that the authors weren't able to impose.	2004-09-19

In an era where enthusiasm for the sciences is often seen as &quot;uncool&quot;, it is delightfully encouraging to read the story of a family, and in particular the author herself, who understand both the value and the pleasure of such interests.<br />The book balances two quite separate elements. On the one hand there's the story of how Sarah became interested in mathematics, did an interesting science project, and got a lot of attention when as a seventeen year old Irish girl she nearly invented a powerful new cryptographic system. On the other hand there's a very clear introduction to the mathematics underlying modern cryptography, presented using a range of interesting examples, puzzles and clear explanations.<br />After an introduction to Sarah, her family, and the intellectual training methods of her parents, the first two thirds of the book focus mainly on the mathematical background, interspersed with regular anecdotes explaining how Sarah came to understand and use different skills and areas of knowledge.  If you want an introduction to this area of mathematics you could do a lot worse than this book.<br />The last third of the book focuses on how she did her science project, and what happened when she won a major prize in the annual Irish Young Scientist competition, including how she and her family dealt with quite unexpected fame and media attention. What is interesting is how seriously the Irish establishment and media seem to take these things.<br />Finally a couple of appendixes present answers to the puzzles, and a few key pieces of mathematical background in more detail.<BR>The book is co-written by Sarah's father David. He's a mathematics lecturer, and on the evidence of both the explanations in the book, and the way he inspired his children it appears he's a very good one. Between the father's very strong skills in presenting mathematics, and the daughter's refreshing simplicity and honesty about all that's happened to her, they make a very powerful team.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to any youngster interested in the sciences, or any sort of academic endeavour. I'd also recommend it to older readers, an encouraging proof that such interests have not been entirely abandoned.	2004-05-08

As a result many developers creating XML-based applications are doing so with the crudest of tools, and find it very difficult to either exchange ideas with more traditional developers, or to benefit from the strengths of more powerful tools and modelling approaches. This book sets out to address that issue, and it does an excellent job. <br />At the same time, the book provides a valuable introduction to a range of XML and e-Business technologies for those more familiar with traditional approaches. I found it answered a lot of questions I had about XML which had not been addressed by reading more typical \\"how to\\" books, so this book bridges the divide both ways. <br />The book starts out by setting out its aim - to bridge the XML and UML communities, and provides a high-level overview of both areas. It then focuses in on the key issue of e-Business integration, both as a common challenge and an area which will naturally affect both communities. <br />In subsequent chapters the author discusses defining a business vocabulary, and shows how an XML vocabulary can be modelled in UML, or generated from it. Having established this basis the author then discusses a number of XML-related standards, including XMI, XPath, XPointer, XLink, XML DTDs and Schemas, and XSLT, in each case using UML models to explain how the pieces fit together. <br />Finally, the last few chapters present an overall e-Business architecture based around the examples in the rest of the book, bringing all the pieces together in the context of Web Services. <br />It's the curse of all technical writers and publishers that whatever you write is rapidly out of date, and this book suffers a little from that. Published in 2001 it views several key standards (such as XSD and core Web Service protocols) as \\"proposals\\", and frequently omits detailsfrom examples because of this uncertainty. A reader would be well advised to supplement it with more up to date reading around the technical details. <br />That said, this book is well written, easy to read, and covers a niche which is still almost unoccupied. The companion web site backs the book up with some valuable material, including a free downloadable tool for XML modelling, generation and reverse-engineering. <br />I'd love David to do a second edition, moderately refreshed to present a 2004 view of the various standards and how they fit together. The core of the book wouldn't have to change. Until that book turns up, I'm happy to recommend this one.	2004-04-03

However, where the first book focuses outwards, largely on what a consultant does, the second book focuses in, much more on what a consultant is, and to my mind makes much less comfortable reading. <br />Don't get me wrong. This is not in any way a bad book: it's still as well written and humorous as Weinberg's other books, and chock full of amusing stories and \\"laws\\" derived from them. Anyone involved in consulting of any sort will still get a great deal out of it. But if, like many men, you're uncomfortable talking and reading about \\"feelings\\" you may find this less easy to read. <br />The \\"Consultant's Tool Kit\\" of the subtitle is actually a complex metaphor. Each component of the toolkit is a metaphor for a certain aspect of your personality and personal capabilities. For example, the wishing wand is a metaphor for understanding, and being able to ask for, what you want from a professional relationship. The chapter around this metaphor first explores why most people either don't know what they want or are unable to express it, and suggests ways to make your wishes clearer. It places this in a professional context, contract negotiation, and emphasises how the personal ability to express and value your wishes will help you negotiate more successfully. <br />In a similar way other chapters focus on developing wisdom and new knowledge, managing time and information, being courageous with your decisions, learning how to say yes and no, understanding why you and others are in the current situation, and keeping yourself in balance, avoiding burnout and other self-destructive conditions. <br />These are all important not only to consultants, but to anyone trying to establish a more satisfying professional or personal life by managing problems, by self-improvement and by better handling their relationships to other people. <br />Weinberg could have presented much of this material in a style much closer to the earlier book, but instead chose a more introspective approach which demands a greater investment on the part of the reader. Only time will tell how this investment is repaid, but I believe it will be for me.	2004-03-09

As the subtitle says, it's a book not only for those who give, or sell, their advice, but it's also for those who are taking or buying it. It's a book both for those who help to manage change, and for those undergoing change themselves. Many people should read it. <br />That said, the main focus of the book is on those who produce the advice and ideas. If you are a consultant as I am, this may be one of the most important books in your collection. I have read it cover to cover twice, and parts of it many other times. <br />The book is written with a light, humorous touch, illustrated both with many funny stories and some very apt cartoons and quotations. From each discussion he abstracts multiple \\"laws\\" and reminders, which on their own should prompt you to remember the key points he discusses. <br />Weinberg doesn't pull any of his punches. Consulting is hard, and the secrets are guides to improving your success and survival rate, not any set of &quot;magic wands&quot;. He addresses ways in which you can fail just as much as ways to succeed. <br />In successive chapters, the book deals with the nature of consulting and the problems it can address, and how to develop your own mind so that your can see the problems and come up with possible solutions to them. <br />Throughout, Weinberg teaches us to focus on the &quot;people&quot; problems: cultural, political and psychological, which tend to be at the heart of any issue, assuming that, as he says, &quot;it's always a people problem&quot;. If you can solve the people problems, the practical problems should be easy by comparison. <br />In later chapters, the book focuses specifically on how to make consultancy more effective: how to improve the impact of what you do, how to help make change happen, and the importance of things like setting the right price and marketing yourself. <br />This is an easy book to read, with lots of good advice very humorously presented. I can thoroughly recommend it to all consultants, would-be consultants, clients and would-be clients.	2004-03-09

It starts with a philosophical discussion of why it is ethically wrong and success-endangering to ignore risks, but commercially weak to simply avoid them, thus establishing that we must accept and manage risk. The book then develops a comprehensive method for risk management in IT (or other) projects.<br />It may be surprising where DeMarco &amp; Lister start from, explaining what risk is, why we need to accept it and why we must manage it, but they explain how common attitudes in the IT industry, which they correctly term &quot;pathologies&quot;, can make it almost impossible to properly acknowledge and manage risks.<br />Maybe it's my background as a physicist, but I assumed that most project managers understand the concept of uncertainty in estimates of cost, timescale and benefits. The authors clearly start from the opposite position. This may be a little off-putting for some readers, but will definitely help those to whom this is a new concept, while the use of &quot;uncertainty diagrams&quot; (probability profiles) will be a useful addition to the toolkit even for those more familiar with the underlying ideas.<br />The book is very strong on how risk impacts budget and schedule, and how to more scientifically make goals and committed targets more realistic. There's a very good discussion of how to assess deadlines using probability theory, which shows the folly of trying to manage large efforts by single deadlines. The book also includes a very good section on brainstorming and analysing different stakeholders' &quot;win&quot; conditions to identify potential risks.<br />One weakness is the almost total lack of discussion of risk prevention - actively working to prevent a risk materialising, or at least to reduce its probability as well as mitigating its impact. For example they quote the example of an operating system upgrade which is incompatible with a &quot;make or break&quot; product development. Any sensible manager would work with the OS vendor and its developer information programmes to actively prevent this, rather than just worrying about its possible impact.<br />When it comes to combining the effects of multiple risks, the authors rely entirely on Monte-Carlo simulation and the &quot;black box&quot; outputs from a spreadsheet (which is downloadable from a web site for the book). This will be a useful tool, but a simple worked example showing the mathematical principles at work would be much better (see [...] risks.htm for my attempt at this).<br />The book is dismissive of time-constrained scheduling as &quot;schedule flaw&quot;, and there is only limited consideration of methods such as Agile Modeling and eXtreme Programming which aim to mitigate or even prevent the effects of requirements change. However there is a good section on the use of incremental delivery to mitigate risk, but possibly somewhat unrealistic in relying on very complete requirements and design before the incremental delivery plan can be completed.<br />The approach to benefits, and the importance of properly assessing and measuring benefit is excellent. As DeMarco and Lister state, you can't do any meaningful risk management or prioritisation unless costs and benefits are estimated, measured and controlled to almost exactly the same degree. Conversely, if you can build realistic models of both cost and benefit in risk terms, you have a very powerful but relatively simple model for project prioritisation.<br />Overall this is a good book which I can recommend, but not the definitive answer I expected from the authors of &quot;Peopleware&quot;.	2003-09-27

The UML purists believe that everything should be reduced to Use Cases, while these authors recognise that much more is necessary.<br />The book covers five quite distinct topics:<BR>1. An introduction to business modelling and UML, explaining the problems the authors want to help solve, and describing each of the relevant techniques of UML,<BR>2. A proposal for a group of extensions to UML (using that language's own established extensibility mechanisms) so that that it can better model business processes,<BR>3. A description of the variety of views and models which will be required to establish a comprehensive understanding of the business, or at least part of it,<BR>4. A repository of \\"business patterns\\", which you can use to model the business,<BR>5. A comprehensive worked example.<br />Each of these is quite detailed. In particular, the book contains probably the best introduction to the Object Constraint Language (OCL), and its use to model business rules, that I have read anywhere. The sections on how to do business modelling are also very good, as are the introductions to the relevant UML techniques.<br />The \\"Eriksson-Penker extensions for business modelling\\" are important because several UML-based case tools have now implemented them as an emerging standard for business process modelling with UML. If you want to fully understand how these work, this is the book to read.<br />The business patterns are more of a \\"curates egg\\". Some are extremely useful, and others innovative which could easily solve your problems where there is an accurate match. That said, some are less good and seem to state the obvious, although with patterns it is always difficult to know if you are judging some harshly simply because you are so familiar with them and other readers will get more value. Some of the pattern explanations are a bit repetitive, and the \\"examples\\" often sound very artificial, but overall they are useful, and a single one which solves a real business modelling problem for you will justify the rest.<br />At over 400 pages, some of which is occasionally slightly slow and ponderous this is not an ideal book to read from cover to cover. But it is definitely one to study, focusing on whichever topic is most relevant to you at any time, and I can happily recommend it.	2003-07-13

If that describes your situation, this book is a very good place to start.<br />The book is beautifully produced, in full colour throughout. This delivers the best of both worlds - clear colour illustrations which communicate most topics as well as good magazine articles, and a book structure which leads the reader progressively through each of Element's concepts and features. The text is well written, clear and concise without being repetitive.<br />Starting with an introductory chapter on digital imaging basics, each successive chapter takes the reader through a group of related features but these are arranged so that each chapter represents a step up in the sophistication of use. This will undoubtedly work well for many readers who want to assimilate skills at a given level before moving on. However, the short \\"feature summaries\\" scattered through the text are no substitute for either a real reference work or step-by-step \\"how to\\" guides.<br />If I have a complaint, it's that the book brushes over some areas which are in great need of this sort of progressive, well-illustrated approach. Good examples are blending modes and filters. My only other real concern is that the discussions on poor practice are sometimes illustrated by examples where the problem is so subtle that an unpracticed eye won't be able to understand the issue, and more extreme examples might have be better. Personally I also found the \\"real life\\" examples at the end of each chapter a little simplistic and patronising, but they might work well for readers less familiar with the world of digital imaging, who are the main target audience for this book.<br />I definitely recommend this book, but be clear what it does and doesn't give you. If you want \\"how to\\" articles, hints and tips then the current excellent crop of digital photography magazines is probably the best source. If you need reference material, this won't necessarily be enough. But if you're not sure what Elements does, why you might need it, or what the results should look like, then this is the book for you.<br />This review was based on the first edition (for Photoshop Elements version 1), but there is also now an updated version for Elements 2.0.	2003-04-20

That said, I think I have not only learned more about structural engineering than I would have done from a positive counterpart, but I have also learned vastly more about the other factors, human and natural, that influence the ultimate success or failure of structures.<br />The book is based on the same material as the late 1990s TV series of the same name, and having watched that series many of the incidents and issues were familiar to me. The advantage of the book is the ability to digest information at your own speed and refer back to earlier pages, but it has to be said that the TV series communicated some of the issues better, helped by animated graphics and by the better mutual support of both pictures and narrative.<br />Each chapter takes a topic, whether a human factor like the law, a type of construction such as the dome, or a cause of failure such as metal fatigue, and then illustrates the issues by consideration of a number of case studies, frequently including some notable successes as well as dramatic failures. In the case of failures the book always attempts to assess both the practical cause, and also any human cause, impact and implications.<br />The book is very well written, in an accessible style supported by some useful appendixes on structural engineering principles. However, sometimes the simple line drawings and verbal descriptions of a structure don't manage to communicate a full understanding, and more sophisticated illustrations might have helped.<br />Mario Salvadori died in 1997 (at the good age of 90), and the surviving author, Matthys Levy updated the book in 2002. My feelings on the update are mixed: the chapter on terrorism, culminating with the collapse of the New York Trade Centre towers on September 11th 2001 is excellent; but why did the author not acknowledge the brilliant success of efforts to stabilise the Leaning Tower of Pisa in the late 1990s?<br />Overall I heartily recommend this book to anyone with a serious or lay interest in structural engineering, and the many complex human and natural issues which influence it.	2003-04-20

This is how technical books should be written: no messing about, no unnecessary repetition, but all the material is covered clearly in about 250 pages. A very clear target audience (experienced VB6 developers), and clear objectives help - the book's intention is clearly to communicate the essentials, and the practitioner will then get more detail from other sources. It's one of the few books of its type which can be read from cover to cover.<br />The book isn't perfect: I spotted a few proof-reading errors (in an early copy based on the Beta version of VS.NET); some examples are a little difficult to follow, and some topics inevitably rather sketchy.<br />However, I can thoroughly recommend this book, although I suggest that the serious VB developer will probably need other volumes as well: I also purchased \\"ASP.NET for Developers\\" by Amundsen & Litwin, and \\"The Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to the .NET Framework Class Library\\" by Powers & Snell, both in the same series from Sams.	2002-06-24

It is written how technical books should be written: no messing about, no unnecessary repetition, and a lot of material covered clearly in just over 400 pages. <br />A clear target audience (experienced ASP and VB6 developers), and clear objectives help - the book's intention is clearly to communicate the essentials, and the practitioner will then get more detail from other sources.<br />The book clearly presents the VB.NET language, the new ASP architecture, how to develop using server-side and user controls, and supporting technologies such as Web Services and ADO.NET. However, there are some omissions. For example, the book states that you can't raise standard events from User Controls, not only is this possible, but the standard MSDN documentation has a very simple example of how to do so.<br />If I have a major complaint, it's that the book was not developed around Visual Studio. Instead the examples are mainly pure text, similar to old server pages. This has two drawbacks: it fails to support the new paradigm of web development which Microsoft have finally raised above hacking with a copy of notepad; and it's sometimes difficult to relate the text-only examples to code generated by the Visual Studio design tools, and vice-versa.<br />Another weakness is shared with many other books on web-based development, especially in the Microsoft arena, with very little focus on how to properly structure code and solution components. I have had to resort to Java-based architectural pattern books, and I think there's a major gap in the market here.<br />This won't be the only book you'll buy on .NET: I also purchased \\"VB.NET for Developers\\" by Franklin, and \\"the Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to the .NET Framework Class Library\\" by Powers & Snell, both in the same series from Sams. However, I can recommend it as a good clear introduction to ASP.NET, which doesn't require you to read thousands of pages.	2002-06-24

It's quite amazing how some of the ideas around the Physics of the very large and very small have developed in recent years, and Stephen Hawking is determined to communicate them to us.<br />He realises that this requires diagrams and analogies, since the mathematics is getting ever more forbidding. As a result, unlike a lot of books on modern Physics and cosmology, this one focuses on pictures and spatial representations. It's beautifully illustrated throughout, almost a coffee-table book. That said, Hawking hasn't neglected the text either - it's clear, concise and frequently humourous.<br />The book starts with the key ideas developed in the earlier part of the 20th century, Relativity and Quantum Theory, but in the context of more recent experiments and observations, which makes it feel more contemporary than more historical accounts. The second chapter explains how these developed through to the 1980s, summarising the various attempts at unified \\"Theories of Everything\\". The book's central chapter investigates what we now know about how the Universe formed and developed, presenting a lot of quite new findings and concepts.<br />After this, the going starts to get harder, introducing concepts like time travel through black holes, and the physics of the strangely-named \\"p-branes\\". You may need to read these several times, and understanding is by no means guaranteed, but Hawking rightly focuses on the key implications rather than the models themselves.<br />The penultimate chapter is a bit of a non-sequiteur, looking at the evolution of human and artificial intelligence. It's a fascinating subject, well described and clearly of great interest to Hawking, but doesn't quite fit with the rest of the book. Finally, the book presents some of the most recent ideas of unified theories - branes again - and makes some sense of why such strange mathematical models are needed.<br />I enjoyed this book, but I wouldn't pretend to have understood it all on a first reading. However, I understood enough to be convinced that Hawking is not only one of our time's great scientists but also, despite his disabilities, one of science's great explainers. If you're at all interested in modern Physics, I recommend this book...	2002-04-10

If you've ever been puzzled by why a partner, friend or relation of the opposite sex just doesn't seem to \\"get it\\", this is the book for you.<br />The authors, themselves a husband and wife team, explain how most behavioral differences between the sexes can be explained by biological differences between men and women's brains. In turn, these derive directly from millions of years of evolution to best fit traditional roles: \\"lunch chaser\\" and \\"nest defender\\". Political correctness is powerless to overturn things which are wired into our brains.<br />However, this is not a reactionary book seeking some scientific justification for an old-fashioned, discriminatory, political or religious agenda. Instead, the authors look at the reality of life since the late 20th century. They establish an explanation of problems in male-female interaction which we can all relate to. Then, where it's possible, they identify strategies which each sex can adopt to better communicate and interact with the other. Not only does the book explain the difference between male and female sex drives, but it suggests strategies for getting more!<br />It's a very well-written book, laced throughout with humour, including some very funny cartoons and quotations. Assertions about the differences between male and female brains are backed up by clear, modern scientific evidence, and several tests for the reader to try themselves. Once or twice I found the book a bit repetitive, especially in the section explaining gay behaviour, but I still read it from cover to cover in a few hours.<br />Everyone should read this book, but especially those who think that political correctness can wipe out the reality of who we are and how we think...	2002-04-05

I'll be honest, I was really was looking for a book called something like \\"Enterprise Java for an Architect who knows a lot about Microsoft DNA but not much about Java\\". This is the closest I've found. It is a very good presentation of how the different elements of the J2EE stack are meant to fit together, common problems and patterns which address them.<br />There are some very good things about this book. It really tries to explain the design forces which lead to good and bad solutions, and does try to put all the different patterns into the context of a \\"roadmap\\" so you can see how they link together. One of the best ideas in the book is actually in the epilogue, where the authors introduce the idea of building an architecture via a UML diagram built from stereotypes for the patterns. I can see this being widely adopted as a useful technique.<br />The big problem with the book is it is dreadfully repetitive. It's not sure whether it's a textbook, a reference book or a design tutorial, so it tries to be all three. The same text gets repeated over and over again, not only between sections but even within a section. By attempting to make each pattern, and each \\"strategy\\" within a pattern self-sufficient there's an awful lot of repeated text, sometimes even on one page. Some patterns almost exact copies of one another and should arguably be strategies for a single pattern. Text is often repeated between the \\"Problem\\", \\"Forces\\" and other sections of the same pattern, where a better  trade-off would be references to a single list of more detailed descriptions. At the same time there are too many self-references in the text, even back to the start of the same section!<br />I found the repetition and overlap between the \\"design considerations\\", \\"bad practices\\" and \\"refactoring\\" sections confusing - it would be better if they all formed part of a single roadmap with the main set of patterns. There's an established concept of \\"Anti-patterns\\", which could easily serve for bad practices and refactoring ideas, and these could also be reflected as part of the \\"forces\\" for the  patterns.<br />Adopting all of these patterns could lead to a very complex layer structure, with a great many classes involved in the simplest task. Several patterns seem to be about wrapping the complexities of J2EE, and you wonder whether there ought to be a more systematic solution to this. The book doesn't discuss \\"managing complexity in the design\\", but if it did it might come up with some simplifications.<br />While I'm not aware of an equivalent book with a Microsoft focus, with a little effort you could also apply many of these patterns in the Microsoft world. However, there are some good Visual Basic patterns books which show how this should have been written. A provocative idea - does the difference between this and equivalent VB books reflect the difference in productivity of the languages?<br />My advice? If you need a good J2EE design pattern reference buy this book, but don't try to read it cover to cover.<br />...	2002-04-05

This book, written by one of the code-breakers provides a fascinating insight into the process.<br />Despite the core subject, this is not really a book about cryptography, but about how to manage people and technology to solve complex, important problems. Welchman was the \\"glue\\" between the pure ideas men like Alan Turing, and the code-breaking production line. His talents were clearly in building the organisation, and liaising between the different parties so that interception, decoding, understanding and using the intelligence became a repeatable success.<br />Welchman's insights into British wartime society and bureaucracy are keen and frequently very humourous. Many of his insights are equally applicable today, in business as well as military circles. For example an individual's promotion, prestige and salary should not depend solely on the number of subordinates.<br />Although he was very modest about it, it is clear that Welchman was no mean cryptologist himself. The book does attempt to explain several of the ways in which Enigma was cracked, but I found the primarily verbal explanations difficult to follow. However, this doesn't prevent an understanding of the principals, and how different methods were applied at different points during the war.<br />The book does have some limitations. Because he was not personally involved, he explicitly refuses to discuss the effort focused on the German naval codes so important to the Battle of the Atlantic, and generally says little about the use of the intelligence information. Sadly, the current edition of the book omits much of Welchman's advice on the analysis of battlefield communications, and how to keep such communications secure. However, one observation has been retained - it was a fundamental mistake to believe Enigma was secure simply because of the enormous computing power required for a brute-force attack. This should perhaps be noted in our Internet age, when so much depends on the assumed difficulty of factoring large numbers.<br />If I have a criticism of the book, it's the rather poor production in places, with very faded photographs and occasionally blurred text. Figures are sometimes absent when they are most needed, e.g. when first explaining the Enigma machine. I read this book having only recently attended an excellent lecture and actually seeing an Enigma - otherwise I would have struggled at such points.<br />Nonetheless this is an excellent, insightful and inspiring book, containing a range of lessons relevant today, and I thoroughly recommend it.<br />...	2002-04-05

It contains the first explanation I have ever read of why intelligent and conciable individuals became caught up in Nazism, and is valuable for that reason alone.<br />The bulk of the book describes key people and events at first hand, and frequently surprises with a very different view to the common one. For example Hitler is portrayed as a bumbling amateur, but with an amazing personal ability to inspire and lead. The Allies' victory was assured mainly by a catalogue of mistakes by the German leadership, some almost incredible. At the same time, Speer identifies several Allied mistakes which lengthened the war - for example failing to follow through and capitalize on the Dambuster raid, or those targeted at ball bearing production.<br />Although a long book, it's well-written and easy to read, and I found it difficult to put down. Amazingly, given the writer and subject matter, there are even some humorous overtones. Related stories and incidents are grouped together rather than in a strict chronology - this takes a little getting used to. More disappointing is the absence of any diagrams or maps. Architecture was Speer's key skill and Hitler's abiding interest, and it is frustrating to read a lengthy description of their projects to be told \\"these plans survive\\", but not to be shown them.<br />A reader is likely to end up with some sympathy or even admiration for Speer. His successes as armaments minister early in the War were matched by humanitarian achievements as he led opposition to Hitler's \\"scorched earth\\" policies during the War's closing stages.<br />However, the reader must also consider some questions: History is written not necessarily by the victors, but certainly by the survivors. Is the fact that only the relatively decent Nazis survived to write their memoirs cause, effect, or the writers' own self-advancement?<BR>Similarly, there is little or nomention in the pre-war and mid-war sections of Nazi philosophy and Hitler's own established hatreds - is this Speer trying to prove how little he knew about the war crimes and genocide?<br />This is an important book, revealing the other side of the Second World War. History may judge Albert Speer to be one of the few \\"decent\\" Nazis. His own book cannot do that alone, but it definitely deserves to be read...	2002-04-05

Many books which do address large systems assume that you are building on a greenfield site, or can somehow ignore the legacies if you are adopting more modern tools for your new systems.<br />By contrast this is a book about the reality of mixed legacy and new technology environments, written by someone who clearly has real experience of large server farms, big databases, high transaction rates and, perhaps most importantly, important legacy systems with hundreds of thousands of lines of code written in COBOL . <br />The book starts by discussing typical problems - things like adding new e-Business presentation layers to existing transactional legacy systems, and briefly summarises how a combination of good architectural practices and appropriate technologies can  address them.<br />The following chapters present a brief history of large system architectures, including transaction monitors, message queuing and client-server approaches before moving on to object middleware with a discussion on CORBA, Enterprise Java and COM and its relatives. This is followed by a more detailed discussion of how different parts of systems can communicate, and how middleware can be classified. A great strength of the book throughout is that Tony is not obviously partial in the Java vs. Microsoft debate, and instead concentrates on their similarities and on strategies which should be able to work in both cases.<br />The core of the book starts with a discussion on the different types of \\"transaction\\" between a system and its clients (users and other systems), and how these relate to business processes. The following chapters then look at three key issues within this context: resilience; performance and scalability; and security and systems management. In each case there is a clear statement of the problems and objectives, followed by an assessment of the relative merits of various possible architectural solutions.<br />The final part of the book presents a process which should lead to system architectures better able to meet their non-functional requirements. Tony believes the core of the process is development of a good business process model, which then leads quite directly to an understanding of the system's components and their interactions. There's some very good advice on practical implementation approaches, and why process modelling gives better results than traditional functional analysis.<BR>The final chapters also address key issues such as how to ensure data integrity and accessibility, and how to manage change through integration and designing for flexibility, before revisiting the process issues and summarising how the architecture should develop.<br />Published in 2000, this pre-dates Microsoft's .NET initiative, the emergence of vendor-neutral messaging standards and the real advent of web services. Each of these will have a major impact on the sort of systems and issues discussed in this book, and you may therefore also  need to read some material more focused on these technologies and others, but that shouldn't detract from this book's value.<br />Overall this is an excellent book, and I strongly recommend it to anyone trying to understand the nature of large, integrated systems and their architecture.	2002-02-15
US	52603767	R3SWBKVPW8TQ7L	020167520X	9043026	Realizing eBusiness with Components	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A useful book for all trying to model enterprise systems	This is a very good, practical book. I found it very readable, with just an appropriate level of textual detail in most cases. It's the first book I read which tries to tackle the problem of modelling and understanding Enterprise-level system interactions. If anything, Paul sells it a bit short by tying it to \\"e-Business\\", since a lot of the ideas and disciplines can apply to less forward-looking Enterprises who are trying to solve traditional integration problems but who may not identify with the e-Business tag.<br />The early part of the book discusses the principles of component-based development (CBD), and how this can be combined with process modelling to both help improve the business, and to provide a clear model for the systems needed to support it. Importantly, Paul sees the development of both business processes and systems as something which must happen progressively, so neither has to be the subject of \\"big bang\\" changes.<br />The next section of the book discusses the different types of components, and their role in a typical architecture comprised of both new and legacy systems. Paul then introduces his \\"CBD Process Framework\\", a way of defining components and then \\"provisioning\\" then by the most appropriate combination of new development, purchasing and re-using existing assets.<br />The core of the book takes a typical business process (car rental) and develops a worked example of the various business, logical and physical models which are required to define the component architecture. The models are each taken through several stages, corresponding to an evolving e-Business process and a system which is growing incrementally. This is much more realistic than presenting the final model \\"as is\\", and allows much better understanding of how the model develops. In many ways this is the part of the book which delivers the greatest real value.<br />The final part of the book discusses different provisioning and funding strategies for CBD, and how an e-Business team should be structured.  There's a lot of good stuff here, which may be very useful to someone new to object- and component-based development. However if I'm honest I found this less useful, since there are better specialist books on this subject and it doesn't hold the interest as well as some of the earlier sections.<br />As an Appendix, Paul presents descriptions of all the major component technologies, and all the major UML-based modelling techniques. This could be a valuable reference for anyone.<br />I have one slight reservation on the book's core - Paul follows a convention in which an \\"interface\\" is a collection of types, and says that \\"by convention\\" the interface includes access to all the types. This is a bit different to the Microsoft model, for example, and may make it more difficult to establish good navigation around the object model, or to support \\"stateless\\" models. However, this is something to be aware of rather than something which should detract from what is otherwise a very useful tutorial.<br />I like this book. The worked examples of developing the e-Business model are excellent, so much so that I now recommend this book to anyone trying to model such things using UML. <br />...	2002-02-15

Instead the first 3/8 of the book is given over to an almost blow by blow account of each contribution to the development of patterns, their application to IT and finally to HCI. There is actually one important message, that patterns can aid communication not only between IT professionals, but also between professionals and users, as a way of describing both the problem domain and the proposed solution. However, this was almost buried in a detailed discussion of pattern format, which is much less important.<br />I very nearly gave up reading at this point, which would have been a pity, since the central chapter of the book contains some interesting patterns, albeit of limited practical use. The &quot;How to Play the Blues&quot; pattern language is an entertaining demonstration of how to use patterns to describe a problem domain, while the patterns for interactive exhibits are a good set of HCI patterns, although focusing on the interaction of regular users with business computer software would be of more general practical use. I also really liked the pattern layout, relying on typography and styles rather than headings to standardise the structure, which definitely enhanced readability.<br />Unfortunately the book does not sustain the interest, and after a single chapter on patterns returns to a strange and lengthy self-review, to the extent of reprinting the review comments the author received on a draft version. This is ridiculous.<br />The book's malaise seems to be symptomatic of the whole discipline. The referenced web sites and books are not much better, with all but a few noble exceptions concentrating on academic discussions about patterns, rather than building a real pattern collection.<br />I am convinced that patterns can be really useful in the area of human-computer interaction and user interface design, just as they have been in many other areas of IT. I also think the arguments about style and format will be won by the author of the first good book that concentrates on building a comprehensive and readable set of useful real-world HCI patterns. This isn't it.	2001-11-28

Half the book, maybe more, discusses the role of a software architect - the architect's approach, attitude, responsibilities, processes and techniques. This is excellent: clear and concise, encouraging if you are a newcomer but still stimulating if you are a more seasoned architect. It is without doubt one of the best descriptions I have read. <br />Unfortunately, the other half of the book is less useful. The technical parts are either too simplistic, or too detailed when discussing a particular solution favoured by the authors. The text frequently tends to become a repetitive and thinly-disguised commercial for CORBA, and there is an obsession with standards such as RM-ODP which are simply not relevant to a great many commercial developers. The few examples are very simplistic, with no real discussion of many of the technical issues which a real architecture must address.<br />The book would have been much better for more care in its editing and presentation. The quality of proof-reading is in general poor, but becomes quite appalling in some of the technical sections - evidence perhaps that the authors allowed their technical stance to dictate a poor choice of word processor. The choice of diagrams seems random: some are good, but some difficult discussions cry out for a diagram (horizontal and vertical partitioning, for example), while in other places a diagram confuses where the text is clear. The reference list is incomplete, omitting even the authors' \\"primary\\" reference which is quoted, frequently, in the text. All this is doubly disappointing when you consider that one of the authors is the series editor, and both were co-authors of the excellent \\"AntiPatterns\\" book.<br />My advice: if you are happy with the technological side of software architecture, and want advice on how to be a better architect, then buy this book, but read chapters 5 through 9 before you even attemptto read the first part. If, however, you are seeking technical guidance in the real world of software from Microsoft, Oracle and a host of legacy systems, then look elsewhere.	2001-03-18
