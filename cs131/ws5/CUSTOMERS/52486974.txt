US	52486974	RFABG2AX8O91Q	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Excellent Seafaring Story	The Life of Pi is captivating from beginning to end, and makes an extroidonary airplane flight, bedtime, or long car trip read.  <br />It begins with the somewhat unorthodox religious practices and schoolyard rememberences of a young boy named Piscine (later shortened to Pi, for obvious reasons).  During this part of the book, a concerning quality can be observed about Martel's writing... That, though religion is interesting sometimes, it must be sustained throughout to have any meaning.  Pi finds good parts about many religions, and practices them all to an extent.  However, the connotations about these religious practices fall off dramatically when the main plot arises.  I wonder if these notions may have been better to leave out.<br />But, writing styles aside, not since Mutiny on the Bounty have I read such a good sea adventure.  When the ship Pi is riding on from India sinks, a managerie of animals and he cling to a lifeboat for safety.  A brutal epic of survival follows, pitting man against tiger, man against the sea, and tiger against everything else.  Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger that so happens to fall into Pi's lifeboat, becomes an integral part of the story for many reasons.  Well, he would have to be, in such close quarters with a scrawny Indian boy, on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific.  The middle of this book, the tale of Pi and Richard Parker's sea hardships and adventures, is the most captivating writing I've seen in a while.  Keep an eye out for the part when Pi reaches the island of algea... wacky!<br />The conclusion is a little concerning.  Martel brings back the religious references a tad, but the audience is torn between two different accounts of the happenings of Pi and his Tiger.  However, in true sea adventure fashion, the audience is ultimately left with a sense of happy completion.  Go get this book and read it, it's well worth it!	2004-06-07
US	52486974	R100BGPPMS3CKS	0380789035	337033298	American Gods	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Gaiman continues to be my favorite author, bar none.	After enjoying Gaiman's Sandman comics and novels like Stardust and Neverwhere, I started reading American Gods with preconceived notions that Gaiman was a very skilled writer.  Yet again, I was not dissapointed... Gaiman is most definitely my favorite author and one of the most interesting in the industry today.<br />American Gods is a book unlike any other I have ever read.  The center idea of the novel is that of the lives of Gods.  What happens to Gods when people stop believing in them?  Are they real, and do they live lives?  Gaiman puts forth the notion that Gods live among us, are immortal, and go about their daily lives just as we do.  From Ibis to Odin, and from Horus to Thor, Gaiman characterizes well-known Gods as enigmatic and real-life people.  But where the real drama plays out is the conflict between Gods.<br />Shadow, the main character, has just been released from jail when he finds out his wife has been in an accident.  Soon, he meets Wednesday, a shady and powerful figure who persuades Shadow to drink the honey-wine of the Gods.  From this point on, Shadow's life drastically changes.  He is thrown into the often strange and mystical happenings of defunct Gods who have come to America to live.  These Gods hold odd jobs, and are trying to lay low in the culture of America.  Shadow must take on great responsibilities when a conflict arises between the Gods, and it is no piece of cake.<br />I love this book for a few reasons.  It has a very defined beginning, middle, and end, and the tension continues to mount throughout the novel until it reaches a epic climax of Shakespearian proportions.  The ending is what makes this book.  The various plot directions mysteriously twist and turn only to meet at the end in a burst of grandeur.  The characters are very interesting and well defined, as they are in all Gaiman writings.  Gaiman has struck a nerve with this book, and all I can hope is that he keeps writing, because he hasn't dissapointed me yet!	2002-11-16

Throughout the novel, the reader is constantly reminded of how inept humans could be when faced with the interaction between intelligences.  Lem exploits the weakness of the human mind in his bold literary opus.<br />Human beings have made contact with an entity completely different from anything they could have ever imagined.  An entity that covers an entire planet, called Solaris, in the form of a vast and illusional ocean.  Kris Kelvin, a roughneck scientist, is commissioned to join three fellow scientists currently stationed on the planet.  He doesn't know that one of the scientists has suffered an unexplainable death.<br />The ocean, sometimes stimulated by human interference, spouts enormous walls of matter called symmetriads, asymmetriads, and mymoids.  The scientists' main goal is to study the planet and its functions, but that task is put to the side while they deal with their phantom &quot;companions.&quot;  When Kelvin arrives, he is faced with the mystery of these spontaneously appearing human forms.  He attempts to ascertain the meaning of the occurrences, and realizes that each human mind catalyzes an appearance of these phantom forms.<br />Studies have proven that the ocean is &quot;living,&quot; and therefore is somehow communicating with its visitors.  The ocean &quot;knows&quot; the memory of each of the humans and interacts with them in the form of the phantom beings.  Kris's companion is his long dead lover named Rheya.  At first, Kelvin resists Rheya, and wishes her dead.  As the book progresses, so does their relationship, growing more and more tangible.  Their communication deteriorates near the end when Kelvin realizes he cannot take her back to Earth.  Snow and Sartorious, the other scientists on the station, don't ask questions about Kelvin's visitor because they have visitors of their own.  Strangely, not much is said about the other scientist's visitors, as they are kept a dark secret from both the reader and Kelvin.  The struggles of the three scientists are well documented in Lem's haunting science fiction masterpiece.<br />Solaris is a gloriously original and suspenseful work that stimulates the imagination.  Lem can be a little over-explanative at times, but nevertheless, Solaris is a great novel.	2001-12-24

Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter.  After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears.  Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age.  Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.<br />Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts.  He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart.  Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene.  Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers.  In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events.  The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.<br />This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.)  All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde.  It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin.  I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas.  So, whether you pick it for required reading or just for pleasure, The Picture of Dorian Gray is definitely a good choice.	2001-12-02

I would not read if these stories didn't exist, I would not write if these stories didn't exist, I would not appreciate literature the way that I do if these stories didn't exist. These seven adventures, written by a master of tales, inspired every imaginative process in my brain and brought out every emotion in my being.<br />The Chronicles of Narnia present a seemingly never-ending epic of immense proportions that bring forth various situations from victory to catastrophe, mystery to explaination, and life to death. We follow the wondrous journeys of four young children through the enchanting land of Narnia, a land you will never forget. Various supporting characters grace the pages, from Father Time, to Aslan the Lion, and even Reepicheep the Mouse, each giving beautiful insight and wonderful understanding. Never will you forget what takes place in these stories.<br />I highly... HIGHLY recommend these books for anyone who feels the need to be enchanted. If you read them as a Biblical allegory or not (and I didn't), these stories will do nothing less than touch your life.	2001-11-12

Out of the Silent Planet is a timeless work of art that has inspired millions. Lewis has intertwined a truly surreal adventure with a deep and meaningful message of peace and tranquillity. His writing is chock full of imagery and beauty. The words paint a picture in the mind so precise that Dali himself would have only wished he could have matched the greatness of this book with his palette.<br />Dr. Ransom, the protagonist, is a very believable character. He and two other men, named Weston and Devine, crash land on the red planet with completely different intentions. Dr. Ransom, having been kidnapped, escapes his captors and embarks on a memorable adventure. Ransom uses very simple logic to learn the language of the native species and he interacts with the four races of Malacandria differently, creating a very interesting and awe-inspiring atmosphere.<br />Lewis, as in his other series The Chronicles of Narnia, uses biblical stories and principals to create and allegory that keeps the reader guessing. The race of Eldil (an energy or spirit type being) offer wisdom and encourage Ransom during his stay on the planet while essentially balking Weston and Devine's petty quest to ransack the resources of the planet. The moral Lewis conveys is a simple, yet important one.<br />Out of the Silent Planet is a diamond in the rough. It was written well before the recent conquest of space and the immanence of technology, so the imaginative view of what Lewis thought Mars might be like is very interesting. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series, which I've read, only gets better.	2000-11-30

I picked up the second one (The Source of Magic) and got frustrated with it. The subject matter of the Xanth series only reaches so far as to cater to the 11-15 age range. Once you get beyond that, or at least for me, it becomes a little childish.<br />This book, however, was wonderfully mind stimulating. It probably would classify as a sci-fi book, which accounts for the futuristic Earth setting, but Anthony draws on his fantasy expertise to add flavor and gusto to this novel. It really is in a league of its own. I haven't even heard of a book or series that portrays the Incarnations (Death, Fate, Time, etc.) in such a special way, let alone have them as characters. The main reason I picked this book up in the first place was because of its unusual cover portraying Death in a yellow car (which we later learn is his Death Steed named Mortis.)<br />The story itself is riviting, drawing on many of the author's own feelings and thoughts to create an allegory (a work that can be read on two levels, in a literal way and then usually a deeper, more thought out way.) It has great action (sword fights, or actually scythe fights, damsels in destress, magicians, ect.) But what really got me was, the arch enemy of Death, the protagonist who is actually a human who assumed the post of Death after killing the previous Death, is Satan himself! What better foe could there be?<br />On a Pale Horse is a truly uncommon and unique book. It is fast paced and extremely interesting. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.	2000-11-28

Alice Walker was not afraid to tell the true stories of her  characters in such a way as not to pry into their life, but to explore what  was happening to them through brilliant dialogue.<br />The people of this book  drew vivid images of dark faces in the mind's eye, and the mind's ear could  hear their thick southern accents. The story is very down to earth, and the  interaction is unforgettable. <br />I thought this was a very gritty and  realistic book, and I recommend it with confidence.	2000-08-28

This is the second book I have read by Neil Gaiman and he keeps getting better. He is turning into a world class author.<br />As  the story starts out in the little village of Wall in England, it’s a  little slow. The first fifty pages or so explore a few different  relationships and what is on the other side of that mysterious wall. But as  soon as the story progresses and the setting changes to the land beyond the  wall, hang on for the ride.<br />I found a few similarities to other great  books that I have read. The idea about a wall and what is beyond it is a  little like Sabriel by Garth Nix. In his acknowledgments, Gaiman thanks  C.S. Lewis for the inspiration. You can certainly feel the Narnia-like  atmosphere in Stardust.<br />This book truly dazzled me. I thought it was even  better than his previous book Neverwhere. Does this mean that his next book  will be even better than this one? I really hope so! We will be hearing the  name Neil Gaiman a lot more in the future.	2000-06-23

Gaiman creates an eerie world that makes you think: maybe there is another culture below us. <br />Richard Mayhew is a believable character, and does things that any normal person from London Above would do. He was shown the ropes of the underground world, and did quite well for himself.<br />The cast of characters: Door, Hunter, de Carabas, Coup and Vandemar, Islington were great. The villains were mean and unforgiving, and the heroes were courageous. I especially loved Coup and Vandemar. They had personalities that made them out sort of like mafia tough guys.<br />I also loved how some of the subway stations had their own little group of people living there. For instance, in Black Friars station their were Black Friars. And at Earl's Court, there was an Earl's Court. Very clever.<br />This is a enchanting dark adventure that keeps you guessing. There are lots of twists and turns that make this book a great read. I look forward to reading Gaiman's new book Stardust.	2000-06-14

Phillip, the child, was taught to keep clear of those \\"negros.\\" He lived in an environment in which people like Timothy were as much a part of the community as he was.<br />Timothy was a big man with a bigger heart. He loved his cat, and all but tolerated the spoiled little white boy. I was glad to see how Timothy befriended Phillip and took him under his wing.<br />This is a great book for any age. I really felt it was too short, and I didn't want it to end so quickly. It's a great heartwarming story with believable characters.<br />I also found the conflict between the white people and the native islanders very plausible. It is beautifully written, and well thought out. It's a quick read, so take in every word like it's the last.	2000-06-09

It deals with the conflicting ideas of Evolutionism and Divine Creation. First of all, I found this book tolerable because it  isn’t bias towards either view.<br />I believe in Evolution because it  answers questions that Divine Creation can’t. I just can not fathom the  idea that everything on this planet just appeared one day because God  thought it would work. I believe that every species on Earth, and even  Earth itself evolved from something else, it was not just put here.<br />The  protagonist wants to teach the Darwin’s Theory of Evolution in his  classroom. He is put on trial for breaking the school board’s set of  codes on the subject (which in ancient times would have been equal to a  trial for heresy and spreading ideas against the will of the Church.) Does  it not say in our great constitution that church is separate from state?  Teachers should be allowed to teach Darwinism to those that want to be  enlightened, and those who wish to remain ignorant can find education  elsewhere.<br />Anyway, I liked the book and how it served the interests of  both views. I found the ending a little vague, but the rest was flawless.  The setting, Tennessee, was factual and believable. It is a great work of  literature, and addresses subjects that were casually swept under the table  before. I encourage you to make your own judgments about this book, not to  necessarily follow all of mine.	2000-06-09

I have always wondered how great writers come up with their ideas. In this book, Bradbury explains his methods to writing a story. Some of them are extremely simple. He makes writing a process that any neanderthal could  understand and use.<br />Bradbury has gathered a few of his old essays on  writing that were collecting dust, and put them in this book for everyone  to enjoy. He explains how he wrote his novels and how he barely got by in  life writing short stories for various magazines. Some of his tales are  quite amusing.<br />This is a great book for a aspiring author. It teaches  great lessons on creativity, thought process, and imagination that you  can't find anywhere else.

I thought this book was a very clever account of the various things that happen in a boy's life. McCammon addressed pretty much all of the usual things a young boy likes to do. He had the monster movies and baseball  games right in there with the bike envy and dislke of church. There were so  many beautiful and nostalgic occurances of youth.<br />I loved the way he  wrote events in a &quot;kid's view.&quot; Some of my favorite examples of  this are Cory's bike. I loved how he thought it was alive and how it drove  him instead of him driving it.<br />This is a fun book full of great  hyperboles and an interesting twist at the end. It was a very beautifully  written book.	2000-05-15

It was one of those rare sci-fi books that focus on not only the space battles and laser guns, but other more interesting subjects. The protagonist, Ender, was extremely intelligent. Intelligent characters come from intelligent writers.<br />Card is a master  mind manipulator. He built the story up so well, he even had me fooled in  the end. This is one of those books that pulls you in. It creates an  atmosphere around your brain so that you are forever lost in the great  story telling.<br />I had to read this book for English II class.

The characters that McKiernan writes are so full of emotion and action, it makes reading a 600 page book easy and fun.<br />One thing that appealed to me was that McKiernan uses a map that is very similar to Europe and the Middle East. He corresponded the cultures of the races in the book with the cultures that actually live on earth according to where they live on the map. Very intelligent. He also blends 5 or 6 languages into his fantasy names and languages, which makes it very interesting. For example, the inscription on a doorway was printed in acient Hebrew.<br />The journey that the characters take is very entertaining and full of suspense to the very end. A few unlikely people make pivotal moves at the climax, which pleased me immesely. It is a great epic adventure which somewhat reminds me of the Hobbit, in the way that it is formatted.	2000-01-28

Sometimes twisted, sometimes magical, and always mystical. It is such a good story, it had me pinned to the sofa for hours. This story has it all: fantastic swordfights, magical  journeys, grusome monsters. WOW!	2000-01-06

The whole silly plot of a guy going back in time, or whatever, is lacking a whole lot of what a real fantasy book should contain. If you like reading about King Arthur or medievil times, then you could read this. I trudged  through it, and when I am looking forward to the end of the chapter so I  can stop reading, that means it is not a good book. That's what happened  when I read this. Don't be fooled by the cool looking cover. If you are  looking for a real fantasy book, look elsewhere.	2000-01-06

It is a robust tale of how a community can be unhinged by the interfearance of missionaries. I has a  lot of good moral value. You should read it.	2000-01-06

I noticed an uncanny similarity to the movie _The Matrix_. If you liked that movie, (who didn't) then you will like this book because it may have been the basis of the story. Garth Nix is a up and  coming author. He has such an ability to entertain. If you can't really  ever find what you want to read when you roam the sci-fi/fantasy aisles in  the store, you can't go wrong with this one!	2000-01-06

I am only 15, and I love the series. I read Hitchhikers Guide and I loved it. I picked up Restaurant and I read it in one night! Thats a first for me. The writing is very neat and  tidy. The funniest part of the book I think is Marvin. He just makes my  day. The concept of a manic-depressive robot just makes me smile. You'll  love the series, and you'll love this book. Excellent read.	1999-08-15

I sensed a kind of C.S. Lewis theme with the horse stuff...kind of like _The Horse and His Boy_ if you have  ever read that. I wouldn't recommend it for someone looking for a Pern-Like  book, it will dissapoint you.	1999-01-01
