This is a really great book for beginners. I'm not a proffesional accountant (my primary area is computer systems administrations) but I have been working in banks for 5 years and I read a lot of books about accounting basics because it was part of my job. And usually those books were either too practical or too academic. But this one is perfectly balanced. It explains you not only what to do but it also gives you a pretty solid background why you should do this and what for. It shows you a complete picture of a small company accounting including major forms, reports shedule, books etc and that's all in just 200 pages. It's amazing how the author can explain in a couple words some concepts which usually takes a whole chapter in some other tutorials. You can read it to just to get some idea about accounting wording and concepts, or you can keep it on the table and use as a Howto giude in your everyday work, it works both ways. And it's pretty fairly priced. Very, very nice book!	2001-07-06

This is a pretty nice book and I'd recommend it for the CCIE Lab preparation. It includes a lot of small scenarions. Each of them is, of course, much easier then the real Lab, and this book doesn't cover everything, but it's still very usefull and I want to explain why. Usually if you use full-size scenarion from ccbootcamp or fatkid they expect you to have 5-9 routers with all features. But let's say you have just 2 or 3 routers and you wonder how you can use them for the Lab preparation. This is exactly what this book was written for. Using this book and a minimal set of equipment you can learn some areas pretty deep. Of course, it's not all in one, it's just a pieces, but if you know how to do each piece it's much easier to do the whole Lab.	2001-06-14

It's just because you have to know a lot in different areas. This book a kind of attempt to put everything together in a pretty thick but one book. I don't think it's a very good idea. You can use it as &quot;extended&quot; blueprint for your preparation and check out what areas you're supposed to be familiar with. But it's definitly not a CCIE exam level. You'll need some other sources of information. Read one book and pass strategy generally doesn't work for CCIE.	2001-06-13

It gives you a very adequate coverage of topics on the real lab and, by the way, you don't have to much choices. As far as I know this is the only available book with realistic Lab scenarious on the market. ccbootcamp is another good source, but it's much more expensive and it provides you just scenarious without almost any comments. <br />I agree that this book has some obsolete stuff as DECnet. Just ignore it. As of today it includes also even the most recent technologies as Voice-over-IP and VPNs, which is much more important. <br />I also found a few minor mistakes in commands, but when I checked full config listings in the end of chapter they were fixed there. Looks like this full configs were copied from real routers and they are correct. <br />Yes, this book can't replace all this tons of books you have to read. It can't give you a deep knowledge of internetworking, but it can very significantly improve your chances to pass. You'll know what kind of tasks and equipment to expect and in a very stressfull environment it's a huge plus.	2001-06-13

I was wrong. The really quick and dirty way is Expect. Expect works like Helpdesk hotline. You call them and they ask you what you see and tell you what you should type. Sometimes you just have no alternatives especially if you're short on time. But the language is pretty tricky (e.g. if you want to look for '$' in regexp, you should use '\\\$' pattern, etc) and I couldn't learn it using just examples included in the distribution package. Then I spent some time searching for the good tutorial and this book was the best I found. Expect is surprisingly poorly documented and I didn't find any other books about it. There are some articles in the Internet, but usually they don't give you the whole picture. This book includes many examples, easy stuff in the beginning to get you started and very advanced in the end. That's everything you need to learn expect and it's written pretty friendly. In some places it's very informal but not too much.	2000-12-29

This book is about 560 pages long, and aproximately first 300 pages describe briefly Internet evolution and basics of IP protocols. It's a pretty interesting stuff, the content is good and style is o.k. too, but you can read it anywhere and I'd say there is nothing special there. The real value of this book in the last 260 pages. There are a few case studies, and it's something really unique. I was very surprised that I've never thought about some issues specific to very large networks. Hub and spoke network design for 800 routers is pretty much different from the 80 routers network. I think there are very few people in the world who are working on so high level and it's very interesting just to take a look at the problem examples they meet in their work.  <br />Probably, this book won't help much in your everyday work, and probaly you'd expect more large network specific information. Of course, I wouldn't recommend you to read this book in the very beginning of your networking career. But if you 've got a strong networking backgroung and you're looking for more advanced design tutorials, this book, especially last 200 pages, would be very helpful.	2000-11-22

If you want to look at typical examples how people use Cisco equipment - it's a right choice. But if you want to dig deeper in some particular area, or if you want to learn networking background you should read something else. <br />I like this way to explain purpose of this book. Let's imagine you met a good Cisco guy and he let you stand behind him and watch how he does his job for a little bit. You can grab some tricks, get some vision of the process, but he is not trying to teach you. It's a good addition to the strong theoretical background but not a replacement.	2000-11-13

I was surprised how many new things I discovered after reading this book. It sounds like a cheap TV commercial :) but in this case it's true. Basically, this book and Halabi's one about BGP - that's all you need to study TCP/IP routing on the CCIE level.	2000-11-06

It covers only one topic - BGP, but in great details. It  explains a lot of possible architectures, relations to IGP protocols, gives  a lot of configuration examples - just everything you need to know about  BGP. And the most important issue that it's very easy to understand, even  the most complex topics. BGP was always something vougue to me, but now  it's one of the clearest topics. Very, very good book!	2000-08-04

This book is pretty thin (about 200 pages, but almost every page contains big picure, table or diagram) and it gives you a lot information about ATM technical details and basic concepts. It contains a lot of packet structure  diagrams,  low level descriptions of different protocols and general  theory. Obviously, it's not an ATM for dummies or how to setup LANE in your  network.  <br />It has many pluses like concise style, many illustrations and  clear structure. It maybe useful as protocol reference or for academic  purposes. But &quot;RFC&quot; style makes it a bit dull and dry. It's also  to short to be a really good reference or tutorial.	2000-07-30

It includes 3 completly different books. The Caslow book is absolutly perfect. It's a very good tutorial, probably the best I know.  I passed real written test  and even I couldn't find answers to some questions from the test in this  book, if you want to read just one book and get the maximum information -  that's it! You might be not able to answer all questions, but I believe it  gives you enough information to pass. <br />But two other books are completly  different. First of all, they are not about cisco. It's just a general  theory, a lot of packet structure diagrams and protocol description.  Language sometimes is very dull and dry. Many topics, especially in the ATM  book are beyond the scope of CCIE exam. Routing book contains a lot of  interesting information about routing history, current problems and  possible ways of future improvements. Probably, these books are interested  to some readers, but it's not the best choice for CCIE preparation.<br />I put  4 stars just because Caslow book is so good that it makes whole library  useful too. But I'd strongly recommend to buy this one book only and spend  the rest of money to some other tutorials.	2000-07-30
US	49970456	R3OB3991QKV4QR	0130226475	236724132	Routing in the Internet (2nd Edition)	Books	3	16	17	N	N	Another look to Internet	There is a general rule of 80/20. It means 80% of networking books cover 20% of the available networking  technologies because they are most common. The average book about internet routing includes 10% of RIP and IGRP, 25%  of OSPF, 20% of EIGRP, 20% of BGP and just  few words about multicasting,  IPv6, resourse reservation, Internet architecture, mobile hosts etc.  Another common feature of such books that they give you static shot of  current state. <br />Usually it's more then enough for day to day operations  and many people are completely satisfied. But some people want to learn a  bit about other 20% and see piture in motion. This book is exactly for  them. Probably it doesn't help you much in Cisco router configuration, but  you can learn internet history and future from the routing point of view.  You can learn a way how routing protocols are developing, what are the  current problems and what to expect in a recent future. <br />This book was  included in the CCIE library set and many people were really disappointed  because it isn't focused on Cisco routing and switching. In opposite, the  most part of this book covers everything that is usually not included in  Cisco books. From CCIE or Cisco prospective this book is not really  interesting, but it has another goal.<br />A few more words about this book.  It was written by French guy, and he is not Cisco employee. His style is  completly different from e.g. Cisco press books'.  Cisco wants to show you  how well and smoothly it has solved problems, and this book wants to show  you what are the problems and drawbacks of current solutions. Cisco gives  you answers and this book sometimes just states questions without answers.  It's more academic review then manual. Keep it in mind if you are going to  buy it.<br />The final words. Sometimes the language is dull and too dry but  if you want to know current state of the internet evolution this book gives  you information which is hard to find in any other single book. This book  is very good but it's goal is different. It's like the most part of  passengers have questions about tickets and they ask ticket agency. But  some of them might want to learn more about airplane itself. They can find  very good book about airplanes. It's also interesting book but it's  definitly different and optional reading for the traveler. The same about  this one. It's optional and not the highest priority book but it really  gives you a lot of new information about internet routing.	2000-07-29

If you want to find the only book covering as much Cisco routers and switches as possible - that's it! This books is focused on how to use Cisco equipment. It  studies you how to install, configure and do troubleshooting and it gives  you some overview of background technologies. The good things are:<br />- It  covers almost all major areas. - The language is very nice! I enjoyed to  read it. - It has very few mistakes. - It's not just a cram to pass exam  and forget everything. It was written for real life and it'd be very useful  if you even don't want to get certified and just looking for a good Cisco  book. <br />Some people think it's to complex to start with, but I think you  can read it any time. Even my wife, who knows nothing about nets, told me  that she found some interesting things there when she occasionally read a  couple pages :) Yes, this books includes many very advanced topics but it's  written very well, from easiest things to advanced, and you 'll find it  usefull anyway. It's a feature of real classics - you enjoy it even if you  don't understand all details :)<br />The main bad thing is that it's obviously  not enough to pass CCIE. I read it after passing CCIE written and many  questions from real exams are not included in this book. But it doesn't  mean you don't need this book for the test preparation. All my friends CCIE  used it for preparation and everybody told me that it's the best resource.  But CCIE is kind of exam which obviously requires more then just read one  book. Instead of looking for the easiest way just try to study hard, read  as much as possible and you'll get it! Good luck!	2000-07-21

Yes it's a very good  review of possible subjects and areas but it's not a tutorial. I couldn't find answer for at least 30% questions from the real  exam in this book. Even if I were able to bring this book with me it  wouldn't help. The only complete source is univer cd - I found answers to  everything there. But all areas except probably of Erlang B was mentioned  in this book. And CD ROM is very good. Real exam included many questions  exactly from CD. But it was not the most difficult ones :)<br />I'd say that  you can use this book as 'extended' blueprint to check what you  should  study and get some clue about required level. But you should also learn a  lot of details from other sources. It's roughly CCNP level (similar to FRS  exam) and if you just got CCNP recently and read this book it may be  enough. <br />Moral: This book is a very good reference for prepared reader  but it's not a networking tutorial. You should study networking somewhere  else and then check your knowledge using this book.<br />Good luck!	2000-07-15

It's exactly WebSphere Starter Kit as it called in the title. It gives your overview of numerous WebSphere components and you start to understand what they are and  what to read next.  But it's not a tutorial. It contains some code samples,  but it's just illustration what can be done. It's like if you visit space  museum you can learn what is space rocket, but you don't know how to build  it. It's also not a complete reference of WebSphere components and possible  architectures. It's exactly the Starter Kit. CD also helps you to get  started quicker. <br />WebSphere is growing so fast in many directions that it  doesn't look like stable environment yet. And this book just reflects this  situation. Authors give you good explanation of core techniques and they  also try to focus on the most important and promising new components, but  sometimes it's not obvious.<br />And, finally, IBM likes very sophisticated  and complicated solutions (just compare Token Ring and Ethernet, IBM old  OSes and Unix, SNA and TCP/IP). WebSphere is a complete and scalable  solution, it works and you can really use it for e-business, but it isn't  easy reading. Be ready to study a lot!	2000-06-30

In some questions you have to choose between appropriate and the  most appropriate answer and it's much more difficult then to find out just  one corrent answer. <br />I believe this book really helps you to understand  the Cisco vision of design rules and ideas. I used only this book for exam  preparation and passed it with 73% (passing score is 65). The score was not  very high and one of the reasons that I didn't find in this books some  terms like 'router cluster' for ATM and StrataCom hardware overview (like  number of modules). But obviously it was my fault that I didn't study SNA  well even this books contains good review of this architecture. <br />I would  say that if you just carefully study this book only after passing other  three exams in CCDP track, you will pass this exam on the first attepmt but  probably your score will be less then 90%, but higher then limit.<br />About  errors mentioned in some others reviews. In the design test it's more  important to understand general ideas then some numbers and command  spelling and usually misspelled command or wrong figures in tutorial are  annoying but they don't affect you understanding of basic design ideas  dramatically. Especially if you have passed previous three tests. I would  recommend this book even it contains a few mistakes.	2000-06-27

Today I passed Cisco Support 2.0 exam and got 864 (passing score was less then 700). I did it using only this book as study material. If you're looking for a single book - that's it!<br />Some comments. This book is based  on Cisco training course and it gives you very good explanation of Cisco  vision of troubleshooting. It's a serious book written by experienced  proffecionals and it really helps you in your work not only in passing the  test. <br />Why did I give 4 stars not 5? First, there are a lot of annoyng  mistakes like illustration content may be completly different from its  title. They are annoyng but not dangerous. It looks like technical editors  checked all commands and their explanation but didn't look at pictures and  other additional stuff at all.<br />Another reason that it was included in  CCNP preparation library but it doesn't include CD, test examples, test  description and other standard features for such books. I had to spend few  hours in Internet searching for the exam details and questions samples.    <br />I'm pretty satisfied by this book. Probably you can find something  better, but this one is enough to pass test too.	2000-06-18

I've just got CCNP 1.0 using this books only (and questionsamples... to be precise). <br />Books are reallygreat. Everything is there. But they were written for CCNP 1.0 trackand it'll be retired in the July 2000. I used last two books to pass BCRAN and CIT from CCNP 2.0 track and it was easy. These books include all required information. As far as I know new Routing exam is also pretty close to ACRC and probably you can use book from this set too. But new switching is very different and the CLSC tutorial may be not enough to be prepared for the new test. <br />Moral is easy. After 31 July, you can use BCRAN and CIT books for new tests without any problems, I'm not sure about ACRC and you should find something instead of or in additions to CLSC. Of course, it's just my personal opinion.	2000-06-18

I used only this book and I didn't find any significant gaps. <br />This book looks a bit strange because it doesn't have  any test question examples and you can't check yourself. ............. Questions are really close to the real test ones.<br />A few words about exam. It's relativly easy  because passing score is low (just 709) and, the most important thing, if  you are asked to enter command they give you a list of about 50 possible  command to choose from. I had few questions on 1600 model line and you  should memorize all 16xx configurations and types of ISDN interface. I  don't know why Cisco likes 16xx so much but I heard that they usually  include question on this specific model line. I didn't have any questions  on xDSL, MMP or l2f. <br />Good luck!	2000-06-07

Some  people put 5 stars and other just 1.  Wonder why?<br />I used this book as the  only tutorial for both exams and I passed them with a good score. The book  really helps you to prepare. It's pretty slim but it contains all required  information. Test examples are very good and very similar to real ones.  <br />But there are some bad things. In a few places it has mistakes and some  of them maybe confusing. It's not very important for exams preparation but  probably it's annoying enough for some people to put 1 star. Another reason  is a book structure. It's not supposed to be a general Oracle tutorial.  It's just the exam cram. You can easily pass exam using this book but it's  also true that you won't have complete Oracle vision in your head.  I  guess, some people don't like it too. But according to me it's a plus, not  minus.<br />And don't forget that these exams will be retired at August, 2000!	2000-05-15

I found another review on this book and that guy wrote that he laso passed with 888. 2 events - it's not a big statistics but you have something to think  about ... <br />And now serious stuff. It's possible to pass exam using only  this book - it's true. And it's not so difficult. But some things like ISDN  or Frame-Relay are covered very breifly and I had no idea what to answer on  some questions during the test because it wasn't explained in the book at  all. But this books gives you very strong background in other parts and the  the chances to get passing score are very good.	2000-04-05

The good things that it's relatively short and information is given in condensed form. If you have some practical background and know general terms (and you should know it as 7.3 DBA!) you don't need to waste  your time on basics. The bad thing that it has many minor mistakes. It's  not crucial for a test, but a bit annoying.	2000-04-03
