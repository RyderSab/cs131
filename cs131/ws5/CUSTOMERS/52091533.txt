No lie; It's like sitting down and talking to your elderly neighbor about things that went down back in the day or on someone; Anyhow, you got this sister Bernita; Her mama didn't want her, her aunt got saddled with her, and hated her(but with time, she saw the error of her ways), her father left her, her granddaddy  couldn't stand her, and that just added up to a pot full of NO LOVE right? well, not quite; See, when one don't recognize something good, another will; and that someone was Bernita's principal Mr Morris, who took her in and made sure she went to college along with his wife(who look beyond the surface and saw some of herself). Well, Bernita makes a good life careerwise for herself, but her personal life leaves plenty to be desired. Between her first husband,a pretty boy, manipulative, no good closet homosexual, her proceeding relationships, to a brother with issues, another white boy with a quasi-religious calling himself Re Member, and on to a minister who has a little extra on the side, it all adds up to a good fun and enjoyable read; You can't help but love Aunt Babe though; and even though most of her life wasn't good, it was good to know that she met someone who saw past the exterior and looked at the interior; Very good book; I love all of her books, and I know it isn't writing something, but I truly wish I could see some more of her books.	2005-07-16

I got caught up in the beginning with Bert trying to be the good executive in corporate America; Yet, some focus was placed more on his secretary's private business, which initially lead me to believe that perhaps some corporate piracy was going on but it wasn't; and the relationship that developed with Daddy Big Bucks and Bert; Now, this book could have really been great with some more financial advice and points as well as cut down the weak spots.Another thing, Bert's wife was on point on a lot of things, yet, he continued to ignore her advice. She saw things more so than he; Also, Daddy Big Bucks; You can't help but admire his business acumen,  you wonder about his idiocyncracies; like not dating women over age 25; good book	2005-06-27

This book is SOO timely; not necessarily because of the boy meet girl theme, but because in this book, someone dies and it sobers you; Just this year alone for me, I have known seven people to die. Most of them were friends; One was my pastor, another was someone I truly cared for; I understand the timeliness of Zane's latest; No, the couple didn't go away happily in our minds; One died, and the other lived and endured the pain. On the last pages of the book, Yardley mentioned that he and Rayne wasted too much time initially because they thought that the other wasn't available,and then more time getting caught up in other's people's problems and letting it get into their lives; Oh, what a timely message; As far as I'm concerned, that alone was powerful; This will probably be my favorite Zane book; for real.	2005-06-26

Usually books that have rape in it, for some reason, I am drawn away or read with caution, but Ms Cooper, to me is a jewel of a writer and as far as I'm concerned, you cannot help but love her books, and this one is no exception. If u really want to know, J.California Cooper is a gifted writer and I personally think she doesn't get her due. You read her stories, and you feel as though you can gain something from her books for your own life. Now with Eula Too, she loved life. She wanted the best and she didn't let life get her down. I loved Madam for what she done, but as time gets one and you notice her own feelings, you wonder about her motives. I am really enjoying this story.

When she meets Charles(who by her own undoing becomes her not so loving husband), who becomes involved with a married woman Nadine, and Mattie conveniently leaves her the potion that should kill the unborn child that Nadine carried for Charles,but instead kills Nadine, Roberta takes advantage of Charles' sadness to make love to her and impregnate her,causing him to marry her but not love her as she wanted so badly. Instead, it is Sara Tate, who gets his heart and gives him a son, Adam (Fool), who Roberta, after learning from a gloating Mattie about Charles' indiscretion, goes over and tries to kill it, which doesn't kill him but instead leaves him retarded. Sara barely gets ponder that, when she finds out that Charles dies after Roberta kills him in bed after making love to her and saying Sara's instead of her name. Fast forward this twenty years later when Adam and Mattie King(John King's parents)hook up and after a rape by a unlikely person,Mattie gets sick and ultimately bears John. The rape gets blamed on Fool(which Roberta tells)and Fool gets a vicious beating that he didn't deserves. This book kept me hooked, and I didn't care one bit for Roberta. She caused a whole lot of pain to people who didn't do nothing to her,(although she paid a hefty price in the end). And the way some of these folk tell things that can cause pain. I didn't like the tales bearers in here at all cause it caused a lot of hurt and pain to innocent folk. In the end,though, John and Fool are together enjoying a father-son moment and peace reigns. The book was good. It kept me glued and I read it within a day.

Books	5	0	0	N	N	Great Reading	I haven't read Autumn Leaves, so I don't have no comparison here, but if it is anything like this book, well I'm all for it. I really enjoyed it. It was a bit slow going at first. But as time went on, I could see that the guy that took over Janeen's hard earned promotion wasn't there for that to begin with. The old man's secretary and Scarlett kind of tipped that off. What kind of ticked me off was the other story not being told here. Why is it that you beat around the bush on the incest issue?? We kept getting bits and pieces to the story, but not the whole thing which ticked me off until it all came out and then you really couldn't see it for what it was worth. However, when the author came and told the story, that is when all the stories came out. What a book. Keeps you on your toes.	2004-07-12

I was drawn to Grace immediately. Some may have thought that she was a little rich demanding girl(to an extent she was),but I saw her as a person who had to constantly justify herself to her friends and family. Trina I really liked, but when that awkward situation came up and she misinterpreted it and caused Grace and Mike to become estranged(and her own for that matter), I lost it with her. I understand looking at things and they are as it seems, but a simple explanation would have defuted that. Instead. she caused a friendship and two relationships to go down the drain. But as they say, Love do conquer all. Great book and I really liked how she explained the folks Christianity. It showed that though they loved God, they were not above fault. Great work.	2004-06-04

And it really ran the gamut of emotions: anger, love, lust, hypocricy etc. George had a good heart to go and see his old friend, but his fiance took it to mean that he really loved her more than her and it tore her and eventually them apart. Then when George is brought up before the church, it wasn't until it got crucial that she even opens her mouth. To me that is not right. Great book and way to go Vanessa!!!	2004-06-04

You have these two ladies, Claire and Brooke, who just lost their jobs due to downsizing. Then when Brooke notices the sachets and soaps that Claire makes, they along with Lorraine,who is well to do, but has nothing to do, come up with the idea to open a business selling just that. Together, they come up with the strategy, Claire making the items, Brooke doing the marketing, and Lorraine with the money and entreprenueral spirit to make this business work and to make it a success. Add a couple of men to make the romance factor, a couple of monkey wrenches(i.e. a greedy,selfish brother, and cheating scheming fiance, along with a reluctant, nonsupportive husband) and you have yourself an entertaining book. What I really like about this is the fact that these women took a bad situation and made a very good and profitable situation from it. Great book	2004-05-16

I cannot emphasize how much you should, if you can't BUY it, go to the library and BORROW IT!!! I saw this guy on Oprah just two weeks ago, and I tell you, It made me really think twice about wanting to be with someone. Because a lot of women are catching AIDS unknowingly and unwittingly thinking their man is exclusive with them, when in reality, they are going with them, as well as men. That is one of the most hurting things to find that you have someone and they cause you this pain. Don't get caught a minute longer out there. Read this book.

You have this mother, Rozelle, who has a bunch of children, but manipulates,bullies,terrorizes and prostitutes them for her own uses. She keeps them in line by making them say, &quot;Honor Thy Mother&quot; and doing things, but in the end, she pays the ultimate price. Tangy, I really liked, but she really went through some real hurtful things. She wants to keep going to school when most of her other siblings have already quit.She loves her mute sister, but hates and alternately loves her brother in law,wanting him for her own.Yet she keeps going to school,becoming the first in her family to finish high school. But just from look at this family from the outside, you can tell that there are some real murky secrets there that make them real dysfunctional.

I got the book Saturday afternoon, and I finished it last night and was sorry to see it end. It is good that one can hold their own in this world, and Beverly did it. But, as time moved on, she distanced herself from her siblings due a simple disagreement. When she goes back down there to take care of the family land, she finds out that no matter what, family is going to be there for you, and when she suffered her loss, they really were. I was glad to see that they did something constructive as well for the land, although, I probably would have given some to the oldest brother to get himself together. You know, you look at a character and you feel taht they can be one way, but as time goes on, you find out, that they are a whole other person, and I found that with Bobby. He had such a good heart, and though he made wrong choices, he wanted the best for his family. Great story. Highly recommended.	2004-03-01

For years, there have been different versions to this story,and for the most part,it made him seem as though he was disrespectful to the lady when all that only happened was this young fella trying to get what he wanted out of his mouth by whistling(as he was taught by his mother and grandmother).Thank God for Mrs Mobley's book. I read it through within a day. Some of the stuff,I had to make myself read,and it makes you wonder how folk can still go on living after such an ordeal. My hat goes out to the memory of a dear woman who lived her life with courage and dignity,and a son needlessly killed. Every mother regardless of her color should read this book.	2004-01-26

The only thing I wasn't crazy about,but I had to admit that it could happen is the story written by Dwayne Joseph. We don't want to admit our dark sides, but they are there. I feel sorry for DeVonte because although he pondered the thought to take the ticket, he didn't deserve getting jammed like that either. And Lisa was just damn flaky to me. On one hand she didn't want the bloodshed or the violence, but why didn't she come forward and tell the dang truth? I don't think she'll have fun with that money either. In the beginning, she was all lovey dovey, but when ol boy got busted, she could saved him and got him out of that jam. To me, that was darn wrong and immoral. Angel Hunter's story is probably my favorite because I could relate to it being a single mom myself. Kudos to her. The first story was good too,and it had its moments, but you couldn't help but smile at the end.We need a sequel. Especially with Devonte's story.	2003-11-07

It has its dry spells, but as it winds down, you can't help but love the book. It is a terrible legacy to know that you may or may not have had anything to do with someone dying. Especially someone whom you love deeply. It is quite another to konw that it is your own mother. This is the legacy that Lilly had to deal with. When her uncaring father and the ways of Sylvan S.C. gets a bit hard to bear coupled with a burning desire to know who and what your mother really is makes you leave, break out the only female figure to mean anything to you and skip town altogether, well,you can't help but admire Lilly's spunk. Now for her to lie initially to the Boatwright sisters is another entirely. If you come there to get answers, why start a pack of lies? But in the end, you can't help but smile. We need more of these ladies in our midst these days. Give me an August and May Boatwright anyday! We are reading this book down here and plan to have the author come down and speak as well next week.	2003-11-01

I live right in Mobile, and was in a downtown bookstore when I ran across the book on Wednesday. Although I badly wanted to get the book, I went right up the street to the Mobile Public Library and got a copy of the book and read it, and I tell you it is something. Poor Inez Albritton took years of abuse, but when she found out about Emmett Till, she wanted so badly to tell, but was so scared that her husband had her institutionalized in a mental health facility. Her daughter,Peggy Morgan, took her knowledge about Medgar Evers, and despite many opposition, told what she knew. What gets me so mad is these men just beating these poor women down. Just beat the spirit out of them, and when they do their dirt, they drink and abuse their families. This book is harrowing, yet poignant and beautiful. this book is highly recommended by me to all women.	2003-10-24

Now, I am NOT surprized about JFK not one bit. There were rumors on his but for years. And when there is smoke, there is a whole lot of fire. Anyhow,I enjoyed it. Now, I knew that Mr Sinatra in his own way did things to help out African Americans(one of them was breaking down the barriers in Las Vegas for entertainers to stay in the hotels)as well as helping Sammy Davis Jr get back on his feet after his accident. I saw that he was human(man, the way he went after the females was something)but I also saw that was a good person and was very generous with his money and he had his problems,but all in all, the book was something.

But when I started to read it, I really fell in love with the book. You have this African American in the 1930s, who against the better judgment of many, goes to South Africa. He tries to do what the mission board tells him by preaching in English only, advocate the reading of the English Bible as opposed to the marula Bible which is written in the Xhosa language,and discourage from taking a more professional ciricullum, but when he sees that the numbers dwindle during his services,the student's reaction to him initially, and his inaction proves to be an act of defiance towards his students and parishoners that he changes his tune, learns the language and preaches in it, help get a set of older ladies out of jail,encourage the students,participate in marches and protest against the pass laws and relocations, and even falls in love and marry a lovely African woman. One more thing I enjoyed about this is the way they described the landscape of South Africa. It was beautiful. Made you think that you were there as well.

SFC Edward Carter was a military man who wore his uniform and duty proudly. As a child of missionaries in India and later in China, where he first helped the Chinese with the Japanese, as well as served in the Spanish War's U.S. Abraham Lincoln Brigade, he exemplified that he was willing t fight for a country that didn't give him a full fair shake. In the closing days of WW2, he was involved in a attack of a small town,despite heavy losses from his unit and even though he was injured himself, he wouldn't leave the scene until the job was done. Although his superiors felt that he deserved the Congressional Medal of Honor, they felt at that time, that due to his color, it would be denied which was rightly so. After the war, he reenlisted and helped to establish a California National Guard base in Los Angeles, and later served at Fort Lewis, Washington, where, he was cited for being an excellent soldier. Despite of his glowing records, he was denied reenlistment and no reason was never given. He appealled constantly for years, but to no avail, and he died in 1963 without justice being served to him. In 1997, after checking on conditions of African American soldiers in WW2, he was finally honored to received the Congressional Medal of Honor. His daughter in law, Allene, who wrote this book,also started to checking into his military and other files to see why he was denied reenlistment, which ended up into a full apology by the Army and President Clinton, as well as coverage in the media. It is an excellent book and highly recommended.	2003-07-07

Again, Ms Bowen has written another book that will have you laughing, shaking your heads and agreeing to the church ladies of the Gethsemene Missionary Baptist Church. When the pastor of the church unexpectedly dies just less than a year short of the church's Centennial celebration(which was an inconvenience), the men committee decide to pick a new minister to the consernation of the women who felt they had no voice. But, as time moved on, they realized that they do have a voice and from then on causes some mishaps that even disrupt the church. I highly recommend this book you won't be disappointed.	2003-07-02

Ms Thomas' books are truly the bomb! Now I didn't care for Sabrina one bit. All she wanted to do was climb up the ladder on some brother's back, and liked to have lost it all because of it. Tangie was nice, but her nocturnal activities was getting out of hand and threatening her otherwise normal life. I was real glad when she got help for that. But I really believe that it has to do with her mom and how her grandma taunted her about her mother. Bonnie was just lonely period. But I applaud her for trying to move on with her life. She tried to fill it with things and activities(making quilts, feeding the hungry)and I feel in the end, she came to grips with that. Now Cordelia(Ms Holy Holy), though nice, had it all wrong. It's alright to find God, but don't forget your family. And in this case, she lost her husband, and liked to have lost her daughter if she didn't have that stroke. I really feel that was God's way of making her pay attention. This book did'nt bore me,it kept my interest, and it comes highly recommended by me.	2003-06-09

Indira married true to form by marrying an abuser, yet in the end, she did well, and Maxine got with a guy who lied from day one but she didn't realize it due to the fact that she wanted it to work.

What Mama Taught Me is a great book. I enjoyed reading it. I truly learned a lot of things within it. It is great when someone can take a child that is not their own and raise them to be great, and even though Ms.Sanford is not here today, she certainly deserves the props she got for raising this man. One of the things that I have learned is to be true to who you are. He mentioned those who were not true to their ethnic and racial background, which was an eye opener to say the least.

As for the book, one does get the feeling that it is definitely scatter brained. I like to feel that she wrote the book as she saw fit, and to be honest it could keep you on your toes.

This one grabbed me because it explored the various things people do in exchange of comfort,personal freedom. Mr Bell pointed out that his mother went to the landlord with the rent money, and told them that if they wanted to see the money, they better fix the steps to their home which was in disrepair. The steps were fixed.Another example told of Bell in the early 60s, after suffering indignities on a trip to Mississippi, unwittingly went into a phone booth in the white section, and got pulled out of the booth by two police officers. But he feels that giving up something on the matter of principle, bought the greatest rewards in the end. And it is something that he(the author) experienced himself. Thought provoking and enlightening.	2003-05-06

Filled with life stories, bits of wisdom,advice,poems and essays, this book will make you come back for more. Written by women in their 50s to their 100s(there were two) who give you words of wisdom and plenty advice. One of my favorite stories was from a 102 year old woman who is the oldest graduate from Spellman(she graduated in 1919), and she talked about how Mr Rosenwald would go out in the southern countryside recruiting young black women with strong Christian values and potential(she said promise)to come to Spellman. She also gave her own personal commentary on the way things were now and why she felt that although this generation had failed to do anything, there was still hope. Her story inspired me the most. A lot of women spoke of growing up in the South, knowing poverty, working for wages that were not compatible with their experience. One lady spoke about working in a laundry for over 50 years because her parents advised her that everybody has got to go out there and work, and so should she. Quite a bit spoke about husbands leaving them(and with no less than seven kids)and how they worked despite of that without the man's help. One woman, who is a great-grandmother, had to take in her four greatgrandkids, because the grandparents and parents as well as the fathers were not interested, and the mother was addicted to crack. Despite the fact that this woman is not in the best of health, she's still thriving and so are the kids(two boys and two girls ages 10-15). One woman quit school, yet went to night school and eventually became a nurse. Another became a nurse after her mother worked hard to do so. She(the daughter) in turn, turned around and helped her mother get her high school diploma and nursing school degree. I could go on and on, but with what I said, you get the point. This book is one of those books that you wish would not stop despite it all. This book deserves more than five stars.(More like 10plus for the content alone). Do yourself a favor Pick up a copy of this book. For yourself, the young mother starting out, anyone looking for a lift, and I promise you, you won't be disappointed.oint.

I enjoyed reading of the Aunt Jemina's who although some folk had beef with them, these women were representatives of Quaker Oats during segregation, and had toured the country meeting people and promoting the product. one of them urged other women to go out and meet others as well. In present day situations, although the women are achieving, they are also having unique situations, such as being one of the onlys,meaning being the only black in town or at a company, or who has achieved some first momentum. One lady spoke of living in a predominately white town in California, and whenever she would go and make an order, the salespeople would hesitate ordering thinking she wouldn't come back and all. Another spoke about having a black West Indian nanny who called her by her first name, told her personal business, and then had the nerve to tell her that they didn't care to work for black people. Then you had a woman who had a prominent position with a prestigious museum in New York, who after the museum changed administrations, demoted and finally fired her despite the fact that she did great things for this museum. She has went on to the Studio Museum of Harlem. And on and on. Most spoke of vacations in Europe, living in the best of communities, but still there was this echo among them if this was really worth it. It should be required reading at colleges and high schools. Very resourceful book.	2003-04-24

Not only did her character do her job, she did her homework as well and came out doing well in the end. You got to find out how the antagonists were feeling in the story as well as those who were victims as well. My only beef was that after reading it a while, I tend to get bogged down in this woman's struggle with the company. I cannot even think that they would stoop so low to put a woman with the most minimal of education in a position that should have easily went to our heroine. Just goes to show you there's still work to be down in this country.	2003-04-04

It is good to have someone affirm you when those in your family cannot, and in the instances of Forestine and Viola, that was the case. Both of these girls were not understood by either of their families, and Viola's case, they marry her off to an eligible bachelor at their church to get rid of her. Even though she questions and asks whether or not she could love this man, no one really answers these things to her satisfaction. To be honest, the union should have never happen. In Forestine's case, she had no support, no backing by her mother, who should have given her what she needed and didn't. Only by her father and Nick, who taught her how to sing and project the gift that she had. Perhaps if she received the nuturing and love by BOTH parents, none of that stuff with her and her brother in law would have started. A great book by a debut author I hope to hear from again.	2003-03-13

He hooked up with a chicken head who knew what she had, but didn't give a flip initially. It caused her to lose him to another woman, make her lose the friends, lose her welfare benefits, and wrack her life to such an extent she almost lost her daughter. And,why buy a home, and have your daughter and her mother under the same roof?? No can do. All she did was try to wreck up him and Dajah, who to me, had the patience of a saint. After having the man's daughter tell her off, and still raise the child when Gina couldn't and put up with the many insecurities that went with this relationship. I would have stayed out of that. It wasn't nothing but heartache. This man tells you he loves you but...his child is important, and he don't even know whether he wants to be with you or the baby's mother(Gina). Well, you don't need to go there. And the ending, it didn't say that who hooked up with who, just gave you an assumption. I couldn't get with that.	2003-02-26

One of the best well kept secrets, and only known to the Pittsburgh area, was Charles Teenie Harris, who made photos out of one shot(hence his other nickname),worked for the Pittsburgh Courier, as well as owned his own photo studio. He photographed the famous and ordinary, rich and poor, black and white(sometimes integrated), and most events in Pittsburgh at the time(1930s-1970s). Once you open this book, you will fall in love and enjoy the photos that this man has made and appreciate his love for art. Although for the most part the photos are tasteful, there are some that are not(murder and accident scenes) and even those are not obscene as one may feel. I recommend this book to all who wish to know of Mr Harris. It is sad that he got accolades after his passing, as well as to never know that his work was returned to him, after going to court to retrieve it. Oh and one more thing, check out Stanley Crouch's biting commentary on Pittsburgh and its history at the beginning. You won't look at history that way again.	2003-02-26

Now, I know who DMX is, I don't listen to his music. But I appreciate the time he took to write his life story because to be real,because we got some brothers like DMX out there, and they need to take the time and read this book. We need to know why some brothers go bad and some go good.Why is it that he did? Mind you, this book is raw, you may not appreciate him cussing up in here, it seemed that he kept going to jail and group homes and not doing well in some school and yet, he did do something positive with his life, then check it out.We need to take this book to these young brothers who don't know what they want to do and show them that it don't have to be like that. I would recommend it along with Judge Greg Mathis' Inner City Miracle.	2003-02-20

OK, you got two sisters, Jasmine and Stephanie. Jasmine is single, college educated, works at the post office, loves her family(though her and sister has sibling rivalry for a while there, and she meets this guy who she feels is the man for her. He tells her he is a lawyer, come to find out, he is the biggest street pharmaceutical pusher  there is and goes to prison, where she supports him even though he has a son and baby momma who just won't go away. In time, she meets another brother Dylan,(who has some of his own drama) who seems too good to be true, and dispite all, comes through for Jasmine on more than one occasion. Ok. That is enough on her. On the other side of that coin is sister Stephanie. At the beginning of the book, I really considered her a true project hoodrat. No lie. She has a daughter with this guy who walks out on her at a most crucial time, and she meets Thomas, a military guy, who wanted just a booty call, and ends up with her. Despite their beginnings, Thomas and Stephanie hook up. He gives her a son, a house, a car, and just as they begin to make wedding plans and Thomas starts proceedings to adopt Stephanie's daughter, in walks Malek, Stephanie's ex, and her daughter's father, who starts trouble and wrecks serious havoc into Stephanie's life, which in the end, makes her lose Thomas. I won't get into how and why, I'll leave all of that for you to read. Another person that was a great character in the book was Big Momma. She was great and not about biting her tongue for none of these crazy guys her granddaughters were getting hooked up with. I kind of wish she kept on them about the choices they were making, but after so much, it is truly about to the person. Yet, this book was truly off the hook. Mad props to Mr Weber. These books keep getting crazy. But they hold your interest, and once again, I read this one within a day.	2003-01-23

So much so that I read it within one sitting. It was just that good. SO good that I wanted more info. It was good to know the REAL deal about Stevie's early life and about Lula, who really went through some ordeals. I loved the aunt who took her in but her &quot;good&quot; husband the &quot;Deacon&quot; was an out and out hypocrite. I just lost respect for him. Her 1st husband(Stevie's father) wasn't much better either. I understood her feelings when Stevie was about to be signed with Motown. You could understand why she wanted to not give him the opportunity,  because of her own insecurities and limitations, yet, despite her own misgivings, she overcame them and allowed her son to become one of the most beloved musical genuises living on the planet today. My only gripe with the book is what became of the other five children she had. What did they do with their lives?? And why did they rush so much at the end with Lula's life? I would have loved to hear more though I understand one's right to privacy. All in all, a good book.	2003-01-23

Recommended by my book club and store owner a couple of years ago, I wasn't able to get a copy until recently when it was republished by Little Brown. Mawi and his family through God's grace was able to come to America despite some hurdles in 1983. It is bad that you had to leave the country of your birth due to starvation, infighting, and possible death. It is another thing altogether to have to face it in America again. Mawi and his brother survived America, learned English and graduated from it. His brother, although promising as a budding entreprenuer, was killed by a drunk driver, during the Christmas break of his senior year. The same fate happens to his father later on. Both men were instrumental in helping Mawi achieve, graduate with honors and apply to several universities, one of them Havard, who offered him a scholarship, and from which he graduated from in 1999. If you ever have a bad day and feel that you cannot make it in this world, \\"Of Beetles and Angels\\"will guide you back to where you need to be. Highly recommended by me for all ages.	2003-01-08

The cussing and put downs about the Seventh day Adventist church of which I belong,(though deep down, I know of which he talked) I could understand and move on from there. One thing I learned from this book is that one can pay for their past dearly, and in the Judge's case, he had to more than once especially when he tried to get his law license and what not. I feel the book is an inspiration to young folk anywhere. See, this man was headed to jail or death the rate he was going. But thanks to a mother who loved him and probably wore out the floor praying for him, was able to rise above his circumstances. A great book by a great American.	2002-12-27

You want to read and re-read,underline, go back and think. Ms Walker's book is very long overdue, and such a great guide. It doesn't deal with just regular issues like going back to school and loving yourself. It also deals with Childhood Sexual Abuse(which she sadly experieced),Celibacy, dealing with your sexuality,loving your hair,domestic violence, and so much more. Please invest in a copy of Jamie's book. You won't be sorry that you did.	2002-12-01

As an ex-military that served during Desert Storm, it did me proud to read how we as a people served, sometimes in the most terrible and racist of conditions, and give their best to a nation that didn't treat them favorably in return. I am sorry that there were some mistakes in there(human error) I didn't know, but am glad someone took the time to give proper credit. Despite of it, I wouldn't dismiss the whole work as revisionist. Someone took the time to tell the story of how we served admirably for this country, and  we can read it. I agree that it should be in the schools for our children to read and every library within this country's paremeters should own a copy.	2002-11-17

It was great!! To see how poverty kept folk from even going to see a doctor about infected gums or swollen organs is too much. Randell was a true dog. To take this young girl's life and make her miserable because he couldn't have what he really wanted is a downright and unmerciful sin and shame. He made Mozelle's life a living hell. To sit and say that the children that came from your wife is not your own,when you know the woman didn't go nowhere, to leave her destitute countless time so you can be with your mistress, to take her little money and then don't give her none and not provide for them,yet eat off their hard earned food is the lowest of lows. I couldn't believe the downright nastiness this man did to his wife and children. And all because of what he couldn't have. I admired Mozelle for building her house from the ground up(with her husband there criticizing her every step of the way)Personally, I would have long divorced him. She had more than enough grounds to do so. Life is hard enough already and here he made it worse. But, I admire Mozelle for hanging in there and making the best out of life. It is sad that she stayed with someone who didn't love her for over three decades, but it wasn't in vain. This book kept me in suspense from beginning to end, and it comes highly recommended by me. One more thing, I personally feel that Mozelle was entitled to that money that Gail was trying to give her. I would have taken it and did something good with it. She deserved it.And I felt she should have gone with Tom as well. He loved her and wanted the best for her. I am just sorry it wasn't him instead Randell at that church.	2002-11-10

I was truly hurt that Ruth couldn't get married at her own church because of her jealous and vindictive ex-husband, but as hurt as she was, she didn't have to take it out on Dewey. I liked the book true enough. But, after you go to bed with a man, you going to start asking for a ring? what happened to getting to know you? Then, why didn't she dig a bit deeper as to the real reason Tiffany and Dewey never got married. Anybody could tell you anything. Then ol girl cussed up a storm, but since I been through that, I excused and understood that. All in all, a good book.If this book don't make you think, I don't know what will.	2002-10-08

Personally, I am not in the market for a husband, but I won't close a door to the possibilities, and this book is a very helpful guide to aid one in that direction. It has 17 secrets in here. My favorites being 2.Make your days as a Single Woman the best days of your life(AMEN!!)some of us are waiting for a man to make those beautiful days for us. Do it for yourself.3. Nurture your spiritual center.Keep God in the loop and pray for that brother. 7.Look like a wife if you want to attract a husband.(you don't see Lil Kim with no husband,don't be dressing like her).She even mentions some of the Fraternal,Professional Organizations and Clubs gathering calendar. I rate it a five because the advice is timely, and it won't hurt and mostly it makes sense. Enjoy the hunt!	2002-10-06

Dvonte was a player for real, and I am sorry that that girl gave him a child. If he was acting like that, and I am not a big advocate of abortion, I probably would do that and call it a day. Temptest was a great character, but she had to go through a lot of trials. For one, she had to come clean with Geren on stuff that would have made him run for the hills,but he didn't. I had started the book around the 4th of July, and put it down until recently, and read it through. Initially, I was disgusted with some of the cussing, then Janessa's and Davonte's attitude with life. What happened with them really made them grow up. Overall,a good book.	2002-10-06

You got Barbara and her husband Bradford. Bradford is a dog, but a rich and influential rich dog nevertheless. So much so, his mistress shows up at his house on the day of his daughter's wedding asking why SHE didn't get an invitation to the wedding? Barbara copes by packing the liquor away internally and silently brooding. Then you have Jolene, the book's tramp, who although is married, screws around with her architect and her husband's boss(which is Bradford). Although she comes from an influential family, she is the black sheep of the family hence her scandalous behavior. Then you have Pearl,who owns the local beauty shop and has a son who is interested in a nice girl,Ashley, who is \\"white\\". But that's not all about her. Guess I best bring up her mom Candice, who is once of those liberal white women who dresses as a flower child,and finds out some things that might affect her whole life. Last but not least, you have Lee on the lam looking for a man who may be her father. Things come to a serious head at a housewarming party at Jolene's new house.Which ties all these folks in. Anyhow, the book flows, you stay interested, and it is worth your time. My only thing is that Barbara should have left, that Bradford ain't no good. And he knew he would have to give up some serious dough if she did. Good reading. You also get some info on the county that bears its name on the book. Been there before due to family living there.	2002-10-04

Personally, it is a sad thing that a child goes through neglect through a parent, and in this case, Addy and Sharla both received the receiving end of this. My only thing is why didn't Addy tell the truth of her rape? Why didn't she tell about the deed? It was so horrible. Then, to give birth to it, and the man you love, just lets it die because he felt it was a \\"monster\\".Pitiful.Then she goes on the train and gets accused of stealing a ring that rightfully belongs to her and get put off the train, so close to the Rusholme she was born in. Then picking up this young girl Sharla, and accidently coming home to Rusholme and meeting Sharla's paternal family. What a story. Slow in some parts, but overall a good story and debut novel.	2002-10-02

Wanted to cry at some of the stuff in it, but you know if things kept on being the way it was, no one would have thought to have their marital statuses changed at all. These guys loved each other. Perhaps not passionately at first, but as time moved on, they did, and the cruelties they withstood, too much. I believe this was the last Steel novel I read and I wasn't disappointed at all.I was surprized by some of the other reviews here. I admit your creativity kind of wans after you have written so many books, and her earlier novels were very well done. How can one forget? But I enjoyed this as well.	2002-10-02

Having good morning songs piped in to the prisons,and serving coq au vin, as well as having taste tests for the Prison candy, and a fashion show of clothes you want to wear in prison. OK. It may not be a part of the everyday world, but who is not to say it won't? Now,Jennifer Spencer may have been a fool to take the fall for any big wig no matter what he done for you or what. Then, in your darkest hour, THEY decide to seperate themselves from you when you really need them the most. You step up in this environment you know nothing about, and DEMAND stuff. And these folks just look at you. But as time goes on, you change the way of the whole prison and come out a hero.Again, I may feel that the girl did the dumbest thing as to take the fall, but again, I quote from the book of Esther, who knows if she was there for such a time as this?? Now some may call this a bunch of fluff, that's your opinion. With the exception of one book(&quot;Flavor of the Month&quot;), I can truly say that I have enjoyed the majority of Ms Goldsmith's books.You get these everyday characters, and they take a situation and work it out for their advantage.	2002-10-01

Then, as time goes on, buys and rehabilitate the jail, have prisoners waking up to various \\"Good Morning songs\\",eating coq au vin, and having fashion shows and taste tests of the candy they sell from the pen? That's Pen Pal for you. Although, I found it a bit far fetched(though I am an optimist here), I still liked the story. Why?? Perhaps I am a sucker for a good story. Perhaps, I am tired to seeing the bad and not the good, perhaps because I want the very best for all despite all that has happened. I found this novel enjoyable,fun and entertaining.

You meet famous and not so famous people in this book.

As sad as the circumstances were, I really believe that Marlene and Jesse were in the situation they were in for \\"such a time as this\\" just like Queen Esther in the Bible. If life had kept on being honky dory, perhaps there wouldn't have been no Ladies in Waiting Prison Support Group. R.J.,Alexis,Keisha, or Rosalinda would not have made the changes they did, and probably stuck to the same men. One of my favorite parts is when Keisha and Tammy double-teamed on Zach in the prison waiting roon and the white woman(Celeste) starts to kicking his .... Personally, he deserved all that and more. Funny moment aside, this novel was so sweet, that it would be considered one of my favorites for years to come.	2002-09-24

With this book, I judged the book by its cover and called it fluff as some of you did, but as I got into it, I really enjoyed it. I felt sorry for Michelle enduring that police raid, and she don't know nothing about nothing. That husband was a piece of work. Now Angela got the last laugh in the end indeed, but how could her best friend do such a thing to her? THen act like all is well? Yep, she got hers too. Then Jada's old man, ... wouldn't work if they sent the job to him, and now he wants alimony and the house?? Sounds unbelievable, but if I didn't go through something similar myself(sans house and alimony), I wouldn't have believed it either. Personally I love Ms Goldsmith's books. She seem to get average women who go through the worst type of things and yet, things work out for them in the end.With the exception of one book, I have enjoyed each of her books I've read. And look forward to her latest.	2002-09-15

And I wasn't disappointed either. I emphasized and been where Katie was. Now I don't know if I could do marry FOUR times like she did. That takes a lot of chutzpah! Yet, she went through some rough spots and did well in the end. And it is not all about weight and what not, it is all about what you feel on the inside that matters the most. This comes highly recommended by me for those of you who have been in similar circumstances and want a lift out of the negativity pit. Kudos to Ms Burks for her great first novel.	2002-09-15

Most of the earlier generations of women were raped by this white depraved man who fathered some of them(tell me about it), then you have instances where you have things going on, but you wondered why it got to that point. Like with Mignon when she left her husband. A little more background wouldn't hurt. Then Megan and her husband left their hometown under the threat of a broken promise. What happened to the outcome? Then you have Mignon's supposed daddy (C.K.),now that was one confused man, and I wasn't surprised to see his outcome.But why didn't Stella own up to the truth and set him straight? And David dating and having relations with his own niece??Alright unknowingly, but still, well, you can surmise that this is one little drama novel here. Another thing is the way the dates were stuck here and there in the book. And the half sister Ruth. Now that was a true thorn in the side, and to think that they didn't know all those years? Too much and for her to do what she did at the wedding? Unthinkable.Not to say that I didn't care for it, but it could have been better.	2002-09-06

Here's my take on this. We hate to know if we or someone we love is less than perfect. Why oh why did the mama in this story do this?? Perhaps she could have done something better with her life than what she did, and her family had no regard for Stacy.(I believe she deserves her own story to be heard)And why didn't she go off on them for their treatment of her?? Oh, this is too much. This sister just about had her at her beck and call, and she barely got any love. Personally when she was ready to get busy with her hubby, she should have turned off the phone completely. Heck, she deserved a life too.A good book. A great effort by Ms Hall.

Anyway, I just had to write and say that I enjoyed this latest offering. See, the other novels, Basil was still slinging but not coming to terms with his business. And I am so glad that he did it here in this book. Ava got what she deserves, and Yancey B. is still that spoiled exacting heifer as before. I really thought she had learned her lesson in the last book, but I guess old habits die hard. Another thing I liked about the book is that it kept in keeping with all of the events that happened(9/11, and the historic Oscars). Couldn't well ignore it. A great ending to a great series. Oh, let me mention Zola. Ok, she was another of those gals that just had to have it her way, but you couldn't help but like her no matter what. The stuff that went down between her and Yancey B, was true,pure unadulterated diva stuff.	2002-08-25

I got this book yesterday, and I wish I could better describe it, but I will try. You have this middle age couple that was in a love rut, well the wife, Louella dreams up her dead female relatives one night, who tell her what to do in the love department, and chile, some of those love scenes in that book would probably rival some of Zane's stuff(which is racy)yet,to keep to the story, the couple gets out of the love rut, and come find out,they have the gift of knowing what is in people's minds, so much so, that they help, as well as frighten some of the townspeople into doing what is right.There were times that I had to put the book down and think on some of the things that was said because although it was fiction, it was if it was talking to me.

If this book don't affect you to the point of sadness or tears, I don't know what to say for you. This book was nothing short of a miracle. I have encountered people with similar backgrounds and they just get by, and expect you to feel sorry for them. With Mr.Stewart, you just want to applaud him. The fact that their father would kill his wife in front of his children with an axe and let her fall out the window onto a tree with not so much as remorse,well, I had no sympathy,no nothing for him, and like his sons, I felt nothing for him or that second wife or those aunts for that matter. What kind of woman feeds fried rat to children? Where is your humanity, where is your heart? what kind of man tells his son(a child) such heartless things, and allow such treatment that your own children leave you before puberty? what kind of woman mentally and physically break down a child just so the white man doesn't? Yet, it was a white man that took him in his own family when you didn't want to be bothered? This is just too much, and then here comes the military giving shock treatments just because you speak up for yourself and feel that despite your early life you should just go on? What kind of stuff is that? This is what happens in Shelley Stewart's life. He went through so much abuse, so much living from one pillar to post,so much betrayal(like the high school principal who wouldn't give him a chance at a scholarship despite the fact that he had the grades and know how to do so) yet despite all of that, he STILL makes something out of himself and is one of Birmingham's living legends..Folks, we hear of how we can't do this because of our background, childhood, someone said this or whatever, I say if this man can go through the stuff he went through and still live to tell the story, and is a man(and we know that men just keep their feelings to themselves and all),well, he deserves my salute, and I say GET THIS BOOK.

Here you have Mason(Malik) who is trying to put his upper class roots behind him and become a whole new person by the name of Malik after going through an initial confrontation with some brothers from the hood who dogged him out as he came out the subway. Then you have Carmen who hobnobs with these folk who isn't who she seems and puts on more airs than air itself,I wanted to say &quot;Enough, may the real people come back please&quot;? Despite it, there is always a lesson in this all.	2002-07-29

I felt though, that the ending was rushed. When Hope got the help she needed,yet, how did she do it?, and what about the fate of Papa? I was real curious on that. I myself wanted to shake Miss Irene and tell her to please take off those darn glasses and take a reality pill. She kept dwelling in the past. Yet, all in all, it was good.	2002-07-23

I first heard of the town through Parade Magazine,when the author did a story on the town and what they did during the war. For over five years, the citizens of North  Platte and surrounding areas provided food,drink,and encouragement to the men travelling on troop trains back and forth from the coasts. What happened is nothing short of amazing. The amazing thing is how did they get some of the ingredients needed for the stuff they made in a time of rationing? Nothing short of a miracle. One lady spoke of making her cakes with turkey eggs as opposed to chicken eggs which really saved on total eggs used and didn't change the taste. All I can say is nothing short of Wow! This book comes highly recommended by me. If you ever felt you were facing a mountain and didn't think you could cross it, this is the book to read.	2002-07-21

I don't regret reading it. I found it to be enlightening. At first,I couldn't take Joyce or Gail for that matter(Lisa either,but I won't go there).But in time the formers redeemed themselves. Ol'Fred Price was just a greasy negro who got what he deserved in the end. Nothing else was said on what else he got in the end. and Faulkner,you just can't help but applaud and like her. Margaret to me was the tragic heroine in this book. It was good and a great sophomore effort by Ms.Spencer.	2002-07-18

It is about three young brothers from the hoods of Newark who meet at a prestigious high school, and make a pact to go through college and medical school together. And they did it. Mind you, two thirds of the guys were not sure if medicine was the field for them initially, but with the incentives and convincing of the one person, they went through and finished med school in 1999. They also won the Essence Awards in 2000, and are doing well. I enjoyed and was empowered by these guys.

When we are we gonna realize that sex is the icing and not the whole damn cake? But back to the book, I felt that Tori was very forgiving of Jake despite the fact that he walked out on her for a year without a word whatsoever. And I dispised him for a minute there, but once I got the whole story, he redeemed himself. Very likable story.	2002-06-13

What would you do if you were in Madison's position? Personally, I would have done it. I am in a situation where my ex moved on and had kids, and despite the fact that I am not crazy about him, I would raise the child if push came to shove and pray hard too. You see, that child is an innocent by product of the deed, and though it hurt Madison to have your dead husband's child looking at you day in and out is a trip, yet with love it really doesn't matter. I also wonder why ol'boy didn't come forth with the discovery and his own secret as well. It would have saved a lot of grief. Other than that, I liked it. It makes you think.	2002-05-23

In this work, she talks about the things females do for love, and how it costs us. She talked about her mother, who would gang up with her dad and belittle her for reading, then outside of the father's presence, she would praise her for reading, and try to placate her when the damage was already done. or when she was with her partner and whenever the partner had a good employment opportunity, the author would willingly go, but when the author got a similar opportunity of her own, the partner was unwilling to go. Personally, I feel we as women sacrifice a lot in the name of love. We are usually the first to change, to adapt, to mold, and go along with the program. To me that is not love. I feel that Ms. hooks wrote the book from a feminist and womanist standpoint, and her points were valid. Amazon.com said that this book would make a great Valentine's present for someone single. I agree. Get this book and grow.	2002-04-16

The story starts in Present day N.Y.C.,and ends in present day Sheyelles Island. But, the bulk of it happens in Italy during WW2. I liked Train, but he didn't have a clue. Bishop was an opportunist period.(Preacher my foot) Stamps was trying to go by the rules, but figuring out that the rules were not written with him in mind, which creates a tugging of the conscience if you will. Hector, for the reason that he was a dark skinned Puerto Rican, ends up in this Negro unit. What got me is the fact that the superiors knew that they were likely in the midst of German territory, and felt that they were &quot;dispensible&quot;. Yet, they kept telling them to get a &quot;German&quot;prisoner. That was a mess up indeed. Yet, the book is good, it keeps your interest due to this kid, who is a miracle indeed. When I finished reading the book, I enjoyed it. Not only that, the answers to which they were looking for were there anyhow.	2002-04-16

I am so glad that we have so many African American writers out there literally bumping into one another that Lord knows we will probably never be tired of them. but, another I met a man and all story??? I know love makes the world go around, but in reality, how many of us aregetting it? Now, I loved Victoria. She really handled herself well. When ol' boy was butt' naked on the coach and no one gave him the invitation to do so. Chile, I liked to laugh my butt off. But, he just went too darn far. Moon was good, but I liked to kick Tory's butt when Amanda came in there threatening Moon's life and She just went away and didn't sit down and tell him the deal. Shoot, she should have gotten more assertive then. I liked Gina and Vera, though it had me wondering if having a man in your life is worth all of that. You had one messing with a white woman, who he claims is his coworker when he is caught red-handed. then, you got another who is an undertaker, and refuses to let his wife go to work, and trying to stifle her individuality. It makes you wonder if having a man in your life is worth the hassle. With the exception of Karen Q. Miller's \\"Satin Doll\\", where I see where the woman ends up alone and liking it,why do we always have to end up with a brother? What message are we putting out in our books? Perhaps, we need another kind of book.	2002-04-16

For instance, did they take the time to show her HOW to cook? or to tell her about sex? or the things she needed to make it in this world? Personally, Sandra was wrong from the get go, she just didn't like the child due to the fact that the child was a product and reminder of her indiscretion. So instead of helping her, they crippled her. Maybe not intentionally, because I knew they loved her, but sometimes you got to teach, then let them live and learn. Now Lilly I liked. She tried her best to be a mom for her grandchild, but there is a lot of guilt here. the first two ladies had started out pretty young, but they did very well with their lives if you ask me. However, they should have taken the time to bring up the last generation. But thank God for those dead ladies to show them the way. And thank GOd for a girlfriend named Crystal who loved her no matter what. And thank God for second chances. I enjoyed \\"The Hand I Fan With\\" and found this one to be just as good. I do recommend it highly.	2002-04-10

It is not fortunate for child stars to grow up and become normal,productive adults. If anything, they are scarred, eccentric, or trying to relive their glory days. But with this lady, you have a woman who just happened to be a child star, survived the business despite her controlling manager, bad business moves, and illnesses. She has turned out into a gracious lady and her book is really great. If you are looking to go back into memory lane to the the good ol' days, well this is the book for you.

I have always loved Miss Angelou's autobiographies starting from &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; until now, and I truly wished she didn't wait so long to put out this installment. I really enjoyed it. Especially when Make' came to the U.S. to take her back to Africa and the events that unfolded after that. I enjoyed it when she and that other old woman double teamed him, yet it seemed as though he turned back his guilt on the ladies though they didn't deserve it. Also, some of the words she put in her book make you want to keep a dictionary close by. In spite of it, I give it 5 stars. Cause it is simply the best. Don't wait too long for the next installment Maya!!	2002-04-08

I read this book, and frankly I really liked the fact that these ladies took their situations and made a better future for each one of them. And I wouldn't mind one of those potions for when the time was right. Here you have a couple of ladies sitting around bemoaning their fates when a sisterfriend of theirs suggested pooling their gifts together and go into a psychic/love potion selling business and boy do it kick off. As soon as they start it, each one of the ladies lose their jobs and they get back together to rethink their strategies. A lot of unusual and funny stuff happens in love potions, but you will be entertained and empowered to see these sisters changing their own destinies.	2002-04-08

Though I felt that Jan was assertive and all, I also felt that she allowed stuff to go down that was unnecessary. I was ticked with her parents. The daddy got the mamma on a dare and married her. But wasn't one step of educated if he tried to be, and because of the conflict between them, they didn't have time for Jan. When she really needed these people, they wasn't there for her,and in retrospect, she turned to others such as her aunt,Don and her girlfriend, who really should have a book of her own. It was good at times, but then it was like feeling in the dark for where you were. Other than that, it was good.	2002-04-01

They even give back to the community with him helping those who cannot otherwise pay for medical attention by visiting them at home, and giving them the medication they need. Lila has an internet Children's Story Hour that is a hit with the kids. while out on their Saturday good deeds, he meets up with these white guys that call him \\"Dr.Porch Monkey\\", when one of the guys have a heart attack and Jack leaves him to die without offering assistance, it brings a citywide furor and a chasm in Jack's and Lila's marriage. Eulelie is back as well as Gil(who is much more suited and liked in the book),the redeeming point of the book comes at the end when the elderly father of the heart attack victim comes into Jack's office and gives him a lesson that has a surprising twist. Now, for a minute, I was ready to put the book down and call it a day,yet, something told me to keep on and I wasn't disapppointed. One part of me wanted to tell Lila to grow up, and maybe this is what she needed to grow up. But with the dillemmas that Lila go through, it bogs the book down.

A mother who has to retire from the thing that driven her the most, and the tension between the siblings when the youngest accepts. Good theme.

Mostly divorce was done more than once in this book to each of the brothers. You have three completely different brothers. One was street smart(Victor),one was book smart(Clifford), and one was religious(Nathan). Now, I don't know about you, but that Demetria was a skeezer from the word GO. How could Nathan and his mother not see that from Day One?? Victor had her number from day one, yet he let things be for the sake of peace. Then, when ol' girl wants to leave, she wants to take ol'Clifford to the cleaners. Now, that wasn't fair at all. She wanted to leave, handle your own business. This foolishness about &quot;love,excitement, and all that&quot; was a bunch of crock, But thank God for Victor and Al to help him on the road. Now Nathan had real good intentions, but he wasn't prepared for Beverly, and she just wanted someone to make her feel good, and at a great expense. Brenda was the salt of the earth, and I am glad she asserted herself though I wondered if she went too far with her demands on Nathan. Then you have Victor. I understood bro' from the get go. No, I am not down for playas', but I understood why he got there. At first I was not feeling him, but as time went on, he redeemed himself with me. I can say that he was a true family man, and he loved his child, and it was pure cruelty what Lynette did(and what's with &quot;Your Judge-ness&quot;? Girl must had slept her way through school) But this was a good one. It kept you laughing, on your toes, and I heartily give it the stars it gets.

I got this book because it was chosen for our local book club here and it came recommended. So I bought the book and read it in one sitting last night. Here is my take: On one hand, you want to love Solomon. On the other, you want to throttle him. I saw this book when it first came out and didn't feel it would keep my interest, so I dismissed it(again),yet, in a way, I really felt sorry for him. See, he only had a mother to guide him, and she taught him not to love one thing, which is why he probably did what he did. Then, he had a father who didn't want to claim him, and with his father's death and notification to appear at the funeral, it really was the thing that messed up his seasons with his wives because it threw him off balance.And Sam didn't make it any better either. Here you have Miriam, who loved him since day one. She brought him into the world, named him and loved him, yet, despite this, she couldn't give him the baby he wanted. On the other hand, you have this child-woman Ashia, who loved Solomon just as equally,gave him a son, fought for her rights and stood her ground, but yet and still in the end, moved on with her life. what a situation. I felt the book kept my interest. I thought the love scenes were tasteful and beautiful. The author really have a way with words. But, I felt that Solomon,despite his good intentions, his charitable ways and contributions, was selfish in that regard. Did he really feel that he could keep up with this type of life for a lifetime? Why did he get mad at Ashia when he came to her in off season? Did he have a right? I don't think so. I feel that the author wrote a great story. I don't agree with polygamy because I feel it gets complicated. As you can see from the book. I wonder what her motivation was in writing it. I am curious.	2002-03-13

You have this abused wife, whose husband beats her and leaves her for dead in the cold. And if it wasn't for those wolves getting ready to devour her, Hunter would have never known that she was out there. There was some statements made in the book that Hunter told Quaye, and that is that we are all worthy of love, and unless she got rid of the perceptions she had of love, she would never know it. It is really sad when a man has to sell his own children in order to eat. That was all he wanted. ANd he had hoped that he was giving his daughter a better life in America. It didn't initially work out that way, but the end truly outweighs the beginning. It is a beautiful love story. Clean,yet very romantic.	2002-02-26

I am trying to get some copies for a African American History program coming up and I recalled that I never did a review on this great book, so here I am. Now these ladies have really told a marvelous story on their lives. It is honest,to the point, and a great oral history from two ladies who told it from the hip and wasn't ashamed of it neither. I was sorry to hear that they both passed on, but thank God, we still have their books to remember them by. Personally, this book should be read by every American,non American and every African American who feels that in spite of obstacles they can't make it. well, here are two examples that did. One was a school teacher and one was a dentist and both worked during segregation. Their whole family were college educated as well. I really liked Bessie. She could have kept you laughing.

Mr Weber's books may be what some call \\"pulp\\",but you can't help but love them nonetheless. Ok. You got Will. Not a bad brother, but he tell stuff to his wife that shouldn't be said knowing her mouth was as big as the earth itself. I agree husbands and wives should keep no secrets, but in this case there should be an exception. What ended up happening to the both of them was just a mess. But it helped. Then you got Kyle. Very successful brother. He has a business that caters to African American women(beauty supply). That is a feat because in the real world, the Koreans got that market sewn up even down here in the 'bama. But, I admired Mr.Weber's choice for Kyle. Despite all that, he couldn't handle the fact that he had a Caucasian wife. Seems to me if brother couldn't handle the interracial mix he made, he should have just stayed out the darn kitchen. Also, why did these other brothers kept coming to him to bail them out?? Couldn't they handle their own business?? I could understand Wil but not Jay. Now this brother really had got the do unto others part down pat. Cause when he dished it out, baby it sure came back to greet him eventually. He had a family he didn't appreciate due to what he learned from his father, yet he did find love(with a woman-child old enough to be his daughter), he screws up and loses it. Now that sister, was something. But, deep down, she seemed to be a good young sister. She handled herself well in the end with Jay. And the closing scene with his wife was just sad and pathetic on his part. Now Allen, for all his good intentions, was just that a good brother. he just had a trifling girlfriend(Rose), and an equally trifling mama. Some may say that Mrs. Jackson got what she deserved in the end. But no one, no matter how they are should get jacked up like she did. I don't understand how Rose slipped through this woman's \\"trifling girlfriends\\" radar. I guess she just wanted a grandchild at any cost. And oh, what the cost. But, if I had my pick, I would love an Allen in my life. Because when he loves, he loves deeply. What I couldn't understand was why Rose was so darn greedy. Heck she wasn't no project ..., she was a NURSE!!! Girl lived in NYC, and got bank. I liked what he did about the ring though. Served her greedy butt right. Funny thing about this book.

Now, this book is similar to the first book, but child, it sure is good.	2002-01-17

You have this girl who goes around with these guys and eventually gets the short end of the stick, and what is the point? Why are we getting these stories about another sister getting dogged by some brother?? If we continue to put out these things, guess what, the reality won't be no better. But if we put out stories that can give us some semblance of hope at the end of the story, perhaps we can be a more enlightened people. Not to put down Ms.Poole, though I feel she has promise, I am getting tired of the same old same old.	2002-01-09

Here you have a young woman who is a Christian and owner of her own financial services business with a fiancee(with his own issues), a grandmother, brother and cousin.She gets raped by someone who was stalking her,then come up with an unexpected situation.It is something that will change the scenario between Anya and Braxton. I didn't care for Braxton because I thought he was just manipulative.He only cared for what went on with him, and not for Anya. The cousin(Sasha) was a character, but she won me when she dumped that actor.He didn't appreciate her for who she was. Anyhow, the stuff that Anya went through is sensitive enough not to turn off the readers. Pastor Ford is the type of female minister I wouldn't mind having in my corner. And this book is deserving of the five stars it gets here. It seems as though Mrs.Murray addresses taboo issues that happen even to Christian people(i.e.adultery,rape),yet she presents it where a solution is found and used. I wholeheartedly recommend it.	2002-01-08

At first, when you open this book, you think that it's going to be just like Sorority Sisters, which was a good book in itself. But as you get into it, you see this young recent college grad (Nina)watch the decline of her parent's marriage, meet a football player who is very unsure of himself and is cruel to her,a brother who just love the ladies, and a materialistic girlfriend who drops designer names throughout the book with no problem. But as you get into the novel you see these people shine. Nina meets a brother who is very sure of himself and loves her(though because of what she viewed with her parents marriage,almost loses him),The mother go through a terminal illness, the brother decided to get married and do the right thing, and the girlfriend,who suprises me here, shows that she is a true girlfriend and lets her girl know that even though there are real bad examples of marriages and relationships, there are some good ones, and just because you took stuff from a man, you don't have to keep on taking it. The finish ends on a good yet empowering note. I would recommend this book to the young sisters out there. Even some of those older ones too.	2002-01-08

But as time wore on, I spent half of the night reading this tale. It was so good. I really was wondering what James' motivation for getting with October was all about.He couldn't marry her, he still was dealing with the wife, and you just leave this woman in her time of need. Seems if you couldn't help her, you shouldn't have hurt her. Vergie was alternately ok and nervewracking at times. She really wanted October to just forget that she had a child and let her and her husband deal with him. I wonder how this story would have ended if she had had more than one child. The aunts were good, but I disagree with them not letting them know that the father was still living.They caused those girls some grief and a lot of misinformation. But how ironic that October meets this man, and he was the link to the man she called father. It really started cooking from there. Let's you know that God is good. Don't give up the ship with October Suite. You won't be disappointed.	2002-01-08

It is so simple, yet so profound. I really enjoyed &quot;The Man who didn't Believe in Love&quot; because it showed how some take the very notion of love and twist it to their own pursuits. The example of the drug addict and the provider is so on the money. Mr Ruiz writes it plain so you can catch it on the first take. It is so true, you can't place your happiness with no one but yourself. It is up to you to make you happy. I am not entirely through with this book, but I am going to say to those who are reading my review,Please, if you are in a relationship and at an impasse, get the book. If you are out of one and want to know why, get the book. If you know someone who might could use this book, get it for them. The reason I say so because life is just too short for the games we play, and sometimes we miss the boat, but thank God for this man to shed some light on this issue and make us better people. If this book does affect you in some way, go out and share it with someone else who needs it. They will probably be grateful to you.	2002-01-04

However,once I read this book, I understood better. This book about a simple man who lived as best as he could during the worst part of the twentieth century really moved me. perhaps because he was an ordinary man, perhaps he had no one to remember him save his own children and those who are still alive , but Charlie Bundrum's story was one of the most moving books I read in 2001. It should get an award. It tells the story of Margaret Bundrum's father, who was a hard working man(the worst he ever done was have a still for moonshine still and shoot two people for trying to disturb his household).Who died relatively young. Yet, his grandson, who was born one year after his passing, tells his story as though he knew him well. Makes you want to meet him and shake his hand. In my opinion, it is one of the best pieces of Southern literature out there today. It deserves the five stars I'm giving it, and everyone who feels that they don't have nothing and feel they have nothing should read it, and be thankful for what they got.By the way, this book was voted by the City of Mobile,Alabama, for its book to be read by each citizen.

Yet, they really come through for Roxanne in this book. Her mom was as ditzy as ditzy could be. ALl she wanted to do was be happy and avoid the worst if possible and that wasn't going to happen. As for Linc, the long-suffering brother, I felt that he handled his feelings for Roxanne well to a degree, but he waited far too long and kept us wondering whether or not he would have confessed his feelings to her. Then you have this young sister(Honey Brown) who causes a big stink with Roxanne's family. All she could do was put up some bravado and talk a lot of crap when she should have had the simple grace to  tell the truth from the get go. Yet despite that<br />Roxanne goes away feeling peace with the encounter. It drags at first, but as the plot thickens, it gets real good.	2001-12-31

For those of you who haven't been to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, please go. It is probably one of the best kept secrets of the East Coast. Anyway, you have Edward, a 12 year old, who comes from Philly to Rehoboth each summer with his mom and sister, as a respite from the grittiness of the inner city as well as for the mother to earn some cash during the summer time. Here you meet Edna, who you may not like, but you do admire for having her own business during segregated times.And feel sorry for Rufus, who has a story of his own to tell.It may seem like the type of novel to dismiss, but once you get into it, you will enjoy.	2001-12-27

My heart went out more to Isabelle more so because that husband of hers was just plain heartless. but to just be kissing and to crash like that, that was a bit much. But I got to give this couple one thing, they didn't carry on no affair, they took their time, and to be real, didn't nothing disrespectful happen in this book. Bill was so hard to feel that he couldn't love that he almost lost out on love until it was almost too late. I really love these kinds of romance. Ms. Steel made a good one this time. I usually read her novels just as they come out now for over twenty three years now,when I first read &quot;The Promise&quot;. this one young girl had it, and I went out and bought a copy, and I've been hooked by Steel ever since. and I am not always a disappointed customer. Now when they make them movies is when I really get mad because they mess up the story line. Other than that, her books are alright by me.	2001-11-20

Personally, I have no problems with the writing style, the story line, the way it ended, none of that. Only problem I had is with the attitude with Sandy,and some others in the book. Now, I understand Sandy for feeling the way she did, after all she went through a major life change(really two if you count her wedding not that long before Adrian's death).And she felt that some of the ladies attitudes were not right. OK. Brittney shouldn't had gotten in the middle of Sandy and Randall's issue, and bottom line,Sometimes, I wanted to smack Janice for her issues, but in all relationships, we may love the person, but hate what they do.

This is not your typical romance book. Yet, in this book, you have Marilee stand on her own two feet and get TWO jobs, pay for her own divorce and custody battle, and save the proverbial day by taking in a pregnant teen, and saving the unwed teen home from going on. To me, that is personal empowerment,self-determination, and courage. The romance was there, but this was more than romance.

But either this brother was checking out the music industry, knows someone in the music industry, or just has one hell or an imagination and or research capabilities to write this book. Not only that, Mr Tyree is one hell of a marketing promoter(i.e. tshirts,key chains). Anyhow, the story of this mama's boy who broke away and become a singing sensation will keep you hooked to the book to the very end. Now, don't let the beginning scare you off, stick around and check out the story of Loverboy and Darin. Now, I didn't care for the way some of the women in here were treated(although they allowed themselves to be treated in that manner, and did I say women? Really little girls. Where were their mamas?), I know that this is the way the music,sports, and entertainment scene goes. I truly hope some of the young ladies check this book out in that aspect especially. I give the book more than five stars, and predict a great future for Mr Tyree. winning an NAACP Image Award has definitely not hurt him. Check this book out folks, you won't be bored.

I was real sorry that Ruth's sorry daughter did what she did to those women. It was too through for me. I just hope she doesn't show up back in that town no more. She isn't nothing but pure unadulterated trash. I liked Hilly for her straightforwardness. Ruth for going back and not giving up on her dreams. And the ladies for starting up that sewing circle and selling baby clothes. A great idea for a great time. Bonnie was good for the time she was there. I found the book a good one. Very empowering.

I had major beef with that. Other than that, I really enjoyed reading this. It is really sad that two ladies who were so compatible and so good were torn apart solely by prejudice. I can only imagine what those two would have done for the world together. I also applaud Uncle Tuney for not giving up on the fight for his land in Texas. Despite the discouragement, despite the times, he never gave up. Hosanna didn't either, but she let grudges hold her back. What a smart woman. Only thing, I had a problem with is that she let Gilda be the only one to sign on any financial transactions, which caused her own undoing. Also, if I had gotten that check, i would have taken it to the bank and tried to cash it. then also, why didn't she approach Gilda later on?? Oh, the possibilities! This is one book that I would recommend to others. Even though a wrong happened here, it still gets right. Way to go Bebe!	2001-08-27

I expected a book where this person just beds all these men, and pays for her trouble. Well, sort of. I found it intriguing because first of all, one was looking for a scorned wife to be the stalker in this book, but I felt all along that it wasn't. (I'll stop so as not to give it away)Nevertheless, for a debut novel, I enjoyed the plot, I really didn't have much sympathy for Jade because hey, we all have been hurt in one way or another, but we don't all go to married people for companionship. In this case, she truly made her bed. And Charmaine, despite the [stuff] she had to put up with,had the patience of a saint. Although I would have been more truthful in telling Jade why Levi came to dinner in the first place instead of springing it on her and getting a lot of unneccessary fallout. For a debut novel, it is good. I look forward to Ms. Mallette's work in the future.	2001-08-01

In Basil's point, it didn't seem clear whether or not he came to terms with his bisexuality, or whether or not, he still had a job with the firm he helped to start, or whether or not the situation was cleared up. I would hate to  see E. Lynn labor on another book dealing with that.(perhaps a short one) As for Yancey, it seems with the help of a loving man, she found the honesty and candor to come  straight with her business, but did it make a better person out of her? Who knows. I tell you, I read this book in about a good day's time. I found it hard to put down,(Bart was something, he made Basil look like a chior boy). Ava, who just never  leaves you bored, was still her same, and honey, she may need a book of her own. Too much.

For one, it is not like she mentioned the names of the characters in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, but if you follow along, you can guess who is what. Then, you really can't catch the story with the changes that this book produces.By the jacket on the book, I was under the impression that Cynara leaves R. to marry the Congressman, but I find that that isn't so.

She was also open and candid about the relationship, and offers tips and encouragement for others as well.Recommended for those in dead end relationships. Another thing: I really couldn't believe that minister. Some of these folks don't have no business being no minister or nothing. I just hope that he got help for whatever ailed him.	2001-06-18

Perhaps because I read the story of the long distance couple who chose career over their marriage. After that, it was a downhill slide, and I didn't bother to read much after that.Now, I am not going to say that the book stinks completely, because it just my opinion here, plus I didn't read it all in its entirety. So do take this with a serious grain of salt.	2001-06-18

I got this novel in addition to another book a couple of weeks ago, and I am so glad that the person did that because this is one heck of a book!! I had seen it a while back and dismissed it. I am truly sorry that I did that because this book is one of the best debut novels I have read this year!! You got this brother, Prodigy, who at the beginning of the novel, makes you want to plunk him on the head for his philandering,careless ways, but by the end, makes you want to just hug him. Now, in retrospect, I kind of find his change of heart sort of false, but then we ALL go through changes, and I can't fault him. It took a wake up call for Prodigy to see that you can't take things for granted like that. I was crazy about Poppa Doc. Although they said that Diane was self-centered here, I really couldn't see that she was that self-absorbed. I seen worse ladies in other novels. Bernard was good. I liked and respected the fact that he was a self-made man. The little boy and his mom Nina were great as well. I give this book the stars it rightfully deserves, and wished that the book never ended. I really enjoyed it.	2001-05-30

It is funny because these ladies sometimes kept you in stiches with the antics they did. It was empowering because the message of the book was that you had to be comfortable with yourself before you let someone into your life. The messages that the Doctor spoke on were very empowering. Then it was romantic because Mariah and Malik didn't rush to bed immediately(well, almost)to handle their business. They took the time to know each other and fall in love. Now , it wasn't all peaches in this book either. (the assault charge and dealing with absent fathers),so is life. It appealed to my romantic nature and for that, it gets five stars.	2001-05-15

The only thing I didn't like is the way she handled some situations. I still would give it a 4 and a half rating because hey, we are all learning, and we ain't perfect.

I got very interested in this book when I first saw the ad for it in my book club. I couldn't resist getting a copy as soon as possible. Fortunately, I was able to get a copy last Friday. I read it almost straight through in two days. (Had to stop to go to church). I found it interesting,engrossing,and hard to put down. The ladies of this novel are just wonderful. I was mad with that little man Eduourd for taking Suzette and not providing. What made me even madder was Philomene and Clement. I was against Narcisse Ferdieu for what he did. He knew he couldn't marry her, but he desired her to the point of breaking up what happiness she did have. That was bad enough, but then in Emily's situation, Joseph really wanted Emily, I believe he could have married her if he wanted to, but the timing was bad for such a situation. What is so sad about these ladies is that for the most part, they were forced into liasions not of their own will. Then, when it didn't look good for the white families after the act, they sold away the offending parties in an effort to do away with the problem. I am glad that Clement wanted Philomene and was coming back for her, but in a sense, I am glad he died because I don't think he could have dealt with what had happened to Philomene. This book is not offensive so much with explicit sex scenes, yet it is good that all could read. I recommend this book heartily to all who wish to read it. You won't forget it.	2001-05-15

Initially, I was on of those who downgraded this book due to me having to work my way through the dialect. Then, I remembered that the author herself worked among these people to bring their story to the mainsteam, and after reading this again just recently, I found it to be one of the best, as well as one of the most empowering books way ahead of its time. If you read some of the books about and by African Americans women at that time, they usually ended up in bad circumstances. In this book, she shows how Janie, although she ended up being married three times, she really never gave up on what she really wanted, which was the love of a good man, and though things didn't work out like she wanted, she still was her own woman. To me, Ms. Hurston was way ahead of her time in that regard. I plan to introduce this book to my daughters when they get of age.	2001-04-09

Despite the title, Johnny loved and loved deeply. He truly loved Destiny despite the fact that she didn't even loved herself. Even though he tried he best to show her. It is so sad. There are many Destinys in this world, and that is the tragedy of that story. A well written book by a very lyrical author.	2001-04-09

However, Alcoholism and Family Dynamics are superbly portrayed in this book. Here you had HyLo, who had a serious monkey on his back, in turn, he terrorized his family, who were scared of him. Yet, in turn, he was like a pussycat with his own mother Gwenyth, who we find out eventually is not who she seems to be. I was glad for Kenzie to face up to her own problems and find peace and give forgiveness in the end. And, I also felt for Della and understood her feelings on things. The only thing I wasn't happy about with this book is the fact that it switched back and forth to past events with seemingly no preparation. There was one section in the book that I grasped when she switched back to the past, but that was the only one i got. Overall, a good effort by a writer I look forward to hearing more from.	2001-03-08

But, like it or not, it is a part of us. Let's just say that the right message is not coming out of it, and that is what this book is trying to convey. Let me also say that Ms. Berry's works will reach back in time with our history. I like that. Perhaps, the message within this book can be read and conveyed. I also recommend Redemption Song as well. Both of these books should be read as many African Americans as possible.	2001-02-01

I liked the way that Camille acknowledged her problem, and then got up and dealt with it. However, as we get into this book, you tend to feel that somehow the ball got dropped here. First off, the book got too many secrets. It had us thinking that Nora was the REAL mother, but at the end, we find out it is another?? Is there a sequel here or what?? Then, why did Wade allow Camille to come into a household knowing full well that Catherine would not love her as equally as she did Mel?? I can see why Camille left as soon as she could. Now, I liked the Reinventing the woman concept here, I was down for that, but I wondered in the end if Nora truly cared about the women she was helping or what?? Personally, this could have been a good book. It has potential, I was into it especially with the self help program introduced here, but in the end, I wanted to take the book and throw it against the wall.Nevertheless, I give it a four for its potential and I still look foward to more by this author in the future.	2001-01-29

But let me address this one. I loved it. Now what was the purpose of digging up Lawrence's body?? What was he going to do down below anyhow?? Upset the other occupants? Now, that was simple and disrespectful. I was sorry for the Parkin's seperation, yet rejoiced in their reunion, and saddened for David.

It really don't make it any better when Regis left the ship in Miami thinking that the woman Laine was crying out in his sleep about was his ex-wife, and in reality his sister. What a sad situation.

I am first sorry that some ladies didn't care for this book. Perhaps she got the examples from the various talk shows she has done in the past, but to be honest, I don't feel that there is nothing we will never know enough of, and this book as well as her sequel to this book is one of the best there is. Of course, we may tend to feel that we know what we need to know to make it in this journey call life, but I feel there is always something out there to know and understand. Now, I read about Claudette and how her husband said he wanted a divorce temporarily so he can get his citizenship, and then he would remarry her??? Now, that just floored me. I wished Dr. Cornish had some more feedback on her, To me, he wasn't coming back.Ever. I don't feel this book is for just the young ladies, some of us &quot;mature&quot; ladies need it too. Don't diss the book, be glad that this woman want to educate her fellow sisters and make them better for the journey. If you feel that you can't use the book, then for goodness sake, get the book for someone you know who could use it, like that younger sister or friend who may need it. And don't call it a novel. This is a non fiction book to inform and empower. We are not getting entertained here. I put this book in my list of books the sisters(or any woman) should use on her journey called life and I feel that it is a useful guide. Don't discount it.	2001-01-01

This book now entertains the things we can do to EMPOWER our lives.One of the things she suggested doing is a Beauty Contract with yourself where you define what beautiful means to you, and then write affirmations as to what part of you you feel is beautiful, and repeat it every day. Thereby, making you into a beautiful person. The last chapter on prayer and looking for guidance from the Almighty was very good. I am a bit surprised that no one has written a review of this book.

What Rahab did was a beautiful,unselfish act that God never forgotten and didn't let pass by. it just goes to show you how God always will use someone to help him in His cause. And how many wished for a man liked Salmon? I mean despite what he saw, he saw her heart, and wanted her despite her past. That takes an extraordinary person to do that. But, one thing he did was pray and seek wise counsel before anything else. It showed that despite his feelings, he prayed for God's counsel. What a beautiful story!	2001-01-01

This young woman, Tamar, went to this family with some hope, even though she knew that folks were talking about that man that was to be her husband and folks knew that he was cruel and very unfeeling. Despite all, she put on a brave front and was loyal to a family that really didn't deserve it. Even after seeing two sons die, they didn't comprehend that perhaps the sons themselves were at fault and not the other way around. It had to be an act of pure trickery for Tamar to get the honor and respect she was so deserving of. And the fact that they were going to kill her without knowing the facts, well, that is too much for me. Judah knew that he didn't marry a good woman, and that her countenance was passed to their children. which is why one must choose well in marrying someone. It can cause a heaven or hell in your own home. Yet, he overlooked the evil done to Tamar and didn't speak up in her defense. It took almost certain death to this woman for him to speak up on her behalf. What a story. We may feel that in this society we live in, we are free from such things. Instead, sexism rears its ugly head in other things such as pay,child care,domestic violence, and other issues and makes us ask Are we truly free as women in this world we live in today? Tamar's story should be an example of God's grace towards us even in difficult times.	2001-01-01

J.California Cooper must be one of the most underrated African American writers there is because outside of her fans, you don't hear much about her. But in my opinion, she is one of the best writers out here. Anyone that could take a story and just make you enjoy it as though you enjoy a good meal or a good movie, that is Ms.Cooper. I enjoyed especially &quot;A Filet of Soul&quot;. Luella may have had a self-esteem problem, but she sure wasn't a total fool. And in the end, she triumphed. The story about Vinnie and her self-centered children will come next. These stories are about ordinary folks whose life become a bit sweeter or in some instances, worse (like Cool in &quot;The Lost and The Found&quot; though I tend to feel he was set up for his own undoing).And in them, you find a lesson, and feel better for it.

Most of the folks she encounter are either trying to put her down,stalking her with crazy notes, and just plain being simple. Combined with the pressures of the corporate world and how she handles that, has the makings of a great debut novel.

One thing I like is that when he was on his own, he never wanted to give up. He just kept on no matter what. He had doubts, but he kept on. His deference to Willie Mitchell is touching. A lot of folk don't remember the ones who helped them up. He did, and the thing with that was they both acted liked gentlemen in their business dealings. when they agreed to do business together, they were tight, and when they decided to part, it was still all good.

If anyone have had trials and feel that they cannot rise above their own ashes, they need to read Ms.Jackson's story, and move on.	2000-11-19

Yes, it is about a group of women meeting to celebrate one friend's 30th birthday,but on the other hand, I also wanted to underline some of the things that the ladies were talking about in the book. A lot of great points were brought up dealing with sex,love,marriage,single parenting,education,children,and more. Not only that, the book is good,clean and very enlightening. And I recommend the book to all who are at a crossroads in life,or just looking for answers.	2000-11-09

I was curious to see how this romantic encounter would end up with her being a minister and all. Initially, I thought that Sin was a drug dealer who turned informant. Despite that, he did have Nedra's back until she had to catch some of the heat after he left. They made him seem hard and cold, but deep down, he had a heart. A lot of twists and turns.	2000-10-31

I found out about this very book here on Amazon.com by checking another friend's wish list. I got a copy of the book, and I read it. I went through the very thing, so I feel what Ruth went through. It is not easy picking up the pieces and starting over,and emotionally, it is not easy undoing what has been done to you for a number of years. I was glad to see her move on, I personally felt that Adrian was too good to be true, until he slipped up. I was truly rooting for them(it's the romantic in me), but like all relationships, you have joy and pain. I would recommend this book to ladies out there in similar circumstances. So they can be all they can be.	2000-10-30

This is a type of book like The Dream Merchant in that respect. In this book, you have a young girl who goes into a coma and meets some unique people who encourage,challenge, and sometimes emphasize the importance of having a dream and never giving up. It seems as though it is a book for children, but I, as an  adult has also been drawn to it as well and have recommended it to others. My daughters saw the book and now they want a copy of their own.	2000-10-24

This book is about mothers and daughters,the past, and how that can come back to you if you don't properly deal with it. I got a copy from the library, and I just couldn't wait to read about these ladies and what the big secret was. Della played a good matriach. However, she didn't deal with her past sufficiently and it comes up to bite her big time 40 plus years later. Ronnie was the proverbial little sister, wanting that dream, but not quite getting it. Celeste was a control freak, and almost lost her family to it. And Niki was good. She didn't let her mother stop her dreams despite it. Those so called friends of Celeste(whatever her name was),was not a friend,but I think that we all could have an Everett(for those of us who don't have no one) or a Lester as well. I must say,the prose in this book made you hate to see the ending.But, the story itself, is beautiful,poignant, and down home. Now, the first book these ladies wrote, I initially didn't like the slowness in the beginning, but as time went on, it got real good. This new book is a step up to better, and I look foward to more great books by these ladies.	2000-10-24

This book in particular I found to be inspiring. Nicki wanted to be closer to a church she felt was the right church for her, and uprooted her family in doing so. Of course, this move was not without its stresses,but all in all, I felt it was a positive move for her because she gained so much in doing so. One thing I liked the author for doing is not putting up this &quot;holier than thou&quot; woman, Nicki tackled some sins as well, and came throgh with God's help. It is a great book for those in their walk with the Lord.	2000-09-24

A friend in telling me about the book implied that the guy was a selfish so and so, and when I read it, I felt that Mersault just didn't care one way or the other what he wanted.Just because he didn't cry at his own mother's funeral, they handed him a harsh sentence?? No previous crimes, no rap sheet, alright, he took a life, one life that didn't have nothing to do with him except for his friend making him do it. Let's look at this. The guy had no goals, no ambitions, no nothing. He has a girl, but it don't mean a thing to him one way or the other. Does that make him amoral?? I feel it makes him irresponsible,unfeeling, and aimless.	2000-09-24
US	52091533	RK4YYY9PHWJKS	0060809779	146114302	Native Son	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A Haunting Piece of Work	I have read this book over 20 years ago after having discovered him in High School English class. (Thanks Ms. Sims), and reading Black Boy. I then graduated to his other works. I feel the reason Mr. Wright wrote this book(and his others as well, his work is so haunting) is to show America what seperatism caused African Americans. Personally, I don't feel that Bigger intentionally killed her, he really didn't know how to act with whites. He was conditioned to fear and respect them. But a side of him questioned this, and he didn't like it. It is sad when a group of people have to suffer indignities just because they are somehow different from the rest. First it was the Native Americans, then, the African Americans, then the Irish, Italians, the Jewish, and now, the gays. I don't see how one cannot see how history repeats itself here. Mr.Wright's books were all very haunting and pessimistic, and that is because he lived it, and he didn't like it. When it became unbearable, he left the United States for France where he lived until his death. I for one, considered him one of my favorite writers and I have to agree with another reviewer and say that every American should read his work. You will never forget it.	2000-09-24

My only sadness was that it ended too soon. I found the book  interesting,and read it within a day. It is sad what Clarye went through  and kept picking the same type of men. It seemed as when her mom kept  talking about those sons needing a father, then Clarye would go and marry  the man. I don't  particularly care for what her minister said.

I remember while being  stationed in Korea, and folks talked about this and how they didn't care  for their less than perfect citizens. I also remember the orphanages there  and how scarce they seem to be. Personally, I felt it was a gripping story,  because of the fact that the author writes of it with such a detachment if  you will. Personally, those parents that adopted her should have never done  so to begin with. At least her adoptive father admitted to his harsh  treatment of her, but the mother acts like she was the best thing that came  off the pike. I guess so when she cleaned your home from top to bottom,  took care of your own mother while withstanding her abuse until she died.  Then married a man who then mistreated her cause he was forced to marry  her???? I MEAN where is the justice here?? I guess she had to write all  this in a detached mode. To me, Ms. Kim suffered got her share and more on  those 10000 sorrows, it is time for her to get the joys now if you please.	2000-08-31

If you can, give this book to a younger  brother or sister and be inspired yourself. It shows how a young man who is  in a troubled home, meets a figure who is between real and mythical,yet he  teaches him lessons that would take him throughout life.

Mr. Major wrote a real nice story  about a brother who is looking for love and not ashamed to treat his lady  like a queen..Many hats off to you there.

I have found this book to be informative,eyeopening, and a healer.

But, I understood why she did what she did. IT don't make me a right out fan, but I can see  why she went there. I didn't like David one darn bit. First off, he was  married and he felt he second fiddle to his wife's work. What happened to  &quot;Let's talk about this?&quot; And the way he acted with Genie was all  about self,self,self. In the end, he took a coward's way out instead of  explaining what he was doing and why.. Well, if you ask me, he didn't need  one bit of love from her whatsoever. This book kept up a good pace, the  irony was there, and the subject, though a well worn one by now, offered a  fresh new perspective.

My favorite part in the book is when he works for a lady and she puts his food right out there with  her dogs, and he refused to eat it, and told her why he didn't. In his own  way, he made a contribution right there for civil rights. I also felt that  he was elusive at times, but I respect a person's right to their privacy as  well. This book should be read by the young and old alike and know that one  is never too old too learn. No one can make that excuse by reading  Mr.Dawson's book.	2000-03-16

Lately, I have been reading a lot of biographies, and this one had me coming back online just to tell the readers how much I enjoyed it. From the minute I opened the book, I was fascinated with Mr. Massaquoi. I was very  impressed with his mother for affirming him as a person and loving him.  That took guts and love. I was glad for the various people who loved him in  Germany when he felt like an outsider(Notice how that changes when the  Allies come and kept mistaking him for an American GI? ).Folks, you can't  help but get this book and love it. I thank the author for bringing his  story to us. It should be required reading and I highly recommend it.	2000-02-29

She grew up poor and was self-made, married well, and had her own business. I didn't like Ifa one bit. You could have smelled her a mile coming and then  some. But what I like is the fact that after the episode, Zena was wiser  and didn't beat herself over the head and just moved on.	2000-02-13

I just felt compelled to write a comment on it. Indeed this book is too short, but it is sooooo goood.

US	52091533	R33RBTT4CJ5R0J	0380805855	178421605	Passing	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A very intriguing read...	I found this book to be very intriguing simply because of Eulelie/Doralee. Here she raised another woman's children into believing that they were better than others &quot;You are a Giles and Don't forget that&quot;. Yet,  she was raised and brought up as poorer as a church mouse. I understand  wanting to be a better person, building toward that life, but that don't  mean that you forget where you come from and she didn't learn that lesson.  Instead, she come into this man's life(after scaring off the  competition),raises the children to be snobs and brats, makes them forget  their mother,controls them, and all the while, keeps a secret inside of her  that if can to the light of day, she'd lose her standing. personally, I  like that Sandra came in because she shook those folks up. I recommend this  book as well.	2000-02-02

You have this guy who loves this girl but for some reason, he gets caught every time he wants to sample some strange fruit, then you add his committment-phobic friend who left the woman he really loved just before they married, and dates women who have  kids that one of them loses her own while getting her groove on with him,  then you add a long married couple who bestow upon him the things to get  his life right. Add some dirty politics, a crooked tycoon, a sexually  confused person, and you have the makings of a great story. What makes this  book so good is that in the middle of this, you see a couple whose been  married over sixty years, help a couple get together and build a good life  for themselves. Put it together and you have this book. It is all that  ya'll read it!	2000-01-27

This one of the Left Behind series is the one I kept starting and stopping. In the end, I find out why. Those locusts are nothing to mess with. It is sad but I feel that we should make a choice on which way they  are going to take and stick to it. I loved the whole series. Yes, some were  predictable, and all that, but you can't help but keep wondering who did  what?  Right now, I wish they release the next book after Assassins  because now I am sure everyone on the Leftbehind site is playing guessing  games as to who did Carpathia in?  However, I want to read this other book  The Last Day. That sounds really interesting.	1999-12-10

I am not saying he is not genuine, but I feel we ALL have sinned at one point or the other. As for his endorsing of T.D.Jakes, that  is on him and it is His book. Now, I am with Bishop Jakes because I do feel  that God wants you to have self esteem, empowerment and the like, and yes,  I tend to feel that God can be labeled as flamboyant(after all, chasing the  moneymakers out of the temple was /is not considered the  &quot;in&quot;thing to do, walking on water, chasing out demons and devils,  I wouldn't call that ordinary everyday things would you? There are hurting  people out there and this man reaches these folks. So long as God's message  of salvation is put forth. Nevertheless, a very good book especially for  the young folks.	1999-12-07

The thing I have a problem with is Rowe. He was TOO possessive. Ok. So, you helped her get over her addiction, you made sure  that she didn't get kicked out of college, but did you have to fall in love  with Verdi, leave your wife, move in with Verdi, and basically treat her as  though she was your possession for over 20 years?  So much so that she had  to lie to see her own flesh and blood?  I have a serious problem with  that. The book itself is great. I loved Kitt. I didn't share Rowe's opinion  of her at all. She worked and had a side gig. Her mother,though flaky, you  can't help but love her. Johnson seem kind of weak in the beginning, but as  time moved on, I was down with him.Verdi was good, but I don't know how she  could have stood for that man's behavior. It was just too much. Initially,  I thought that her addiction was more longer than I anticipated. But I was  glad that she overcomed it. I was a bit ticked when she started do it again  after being off of it for so long. A good read.	1999-12-02

The characters are well-developed, the plot with its usual mysterious twists and turns, and though he take a few licks, he still  comes out on top. I guess what intrigued me most about this novel is the  fact that a couple of black men disappear into thin air after walking into  a murder they had nothing to do with. We see how the community comes to the  aid of these men and how they close ranks on outsiders. The book was very  reminiscent of its times (the 50's), rascist cops, pre-civil rights. I  liked Lincoln for his persistence. Erotica, I didn't like because at times  she seem to set him on a wild goose chase.Craig Roberts and Brinkman were  not favorites, but one could not resist loving Mrs.Dibell.  A real good  intriging book.	1999-09-03

Because I am currently unemployed, I truly felt what Caleb was going through, and it made me cry. It is a pitiful thing for a parent to leave a child, and never look back,  but to rectify them, is very hard. I understood how and why these men had  the issues they did. One brother did his own thing, another was the  caretaker for the other two, and the other was just caught up in some  negative stuff, that he couldn't see the hand that tried to help him. I  feel sisters should read this book to understand how a man thinks and  feels.	1999-08-31

Yes, there were grammatical errors, but not as bad as some of these other self-published works out there. At first, it dragged,  but as you get into it, it is really good. I really liked the young lady in  the story who was careful to give her jewels to the wrong kind of man, and  when she did give it to someone she thought was genuine, she still learned  her lesson, and moved on. Her cousin made me proud by going to church. I  liked that.  Support out authors folks, and give them the feedback they  need so they won't do the same mistakes again.	1999-08-05

I have been a fan since Sisters and Lovers, and I was glad to see Amazon.com feature the book on their top page. I loved it, though the sex scenes were overheated like a pot flowing over, I enjoyed  it.Chante was good, but gullible. What ever happened to checking a brother  out before he saw your drawers? Stephan, I liked, but he got what he  deserved. His own father fed him some crap, and knowing how he ended up, he  still went for it. I loved the stepdaddy, but it seemed, as though even  though he didn't like him, he respected him.Jake, I didnt like at all. But  I am glad he found his peace with the dreams. It seems as though one has to  go through some hard things just to learn a lesson.Karen was trifling,now  she needs a book on her. Tammi and Darnell, I loved, though I was like the  rest of the characters who told them not to go to the hotel that night.  But, they handled themselves like pros. Toyomi, I understand her anger very  well, but how long are you going to be a one woman hit squad? This book is  the bomb. Oh by the way, check out the two &quot;ladies&quot; in the club.

Yes, this book may have been an InteriorsII, but from what I have been told, that book has been published without her ok. Basically, she needed to tell the lessons she has learned from her life in her own time and her own  way.. So as far as I'm concerned, I'm glad she wrote the book. I was  fascinated and read through the whole weekend.	1999-03-30

But in this book, I was ready to kick Reesy butt my own self. She knew how Misty had so many dead end relationships and now to finally find a man who treats her  like the queen she is, and Reesy's green eyed monster is about to take  over, as well as destroy her own good thing, well, I was ready to whip her  butt. But, she was only being human. Overall, I loved it. I didn't read it  in a marathon sitting because it started to get good for me only by the  middle. But, I still give it a thumbs up. Keep it up Ms Files, I want to  hear from you soon.	1999-03-10

I bought the book when it first came out, and I thought it made a lot of sense. In this day and age, our brothers and sisters on a whole are not getting along, and this book, for all it is, is good. I enjoyed it, and  plan to buy the book for a girlfriend for her birthday. I'm not crazy on  some points, but overall, girlfriend makes a lot of sense.	1999-03-10

The brother made some valid points,although I had a problem as well with the writing. However,I think we caught what he was trying to  say.Ladies, if you want something that lasts, then take a lesson from some  of the sisters in this book. Men,same thing. It is too many of us out there  alone wasting time instead of trying to get it right. Just do it.	1999-02-25

I bought the book for my daughters, and just last weekend, my nine year old daughter said: &quot;Mommy, that book makes me feel good&quot; She takes the book with her and I'm planning to buy another copy for my seven  year old since she is still learning to read, and my oldest has claimed the  book for her personal own. Thank you ladies for this book.If I could, I  would get it for all these young children because they need to feel good  about themselves.	1999-02-23

What i liked about this family is that they stuck together like a family, although there was no actual bloodline between a lot of them, and they had financial leeway to  do what they had to do. This book also has one of the most erotic scenes  ever!!!(Check outGrace Mae and Henry). a class act!!	1999-02-03

When I first saw the book on the net, I had it ordered, and I wasn't disappointed to get it or by the stories in there. My favorite one was when the woman who was a so called &quot;plain Jane&quot; transformed herself  into a beautiful woman. maybe because i can truly relate to it..	1999-02-02
