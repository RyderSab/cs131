Very effective!	Several months ago I bought 'All The Spanish You'll Need' for my family to prepare us for a trip to Mexico.  I work for a company that has branches throughout Latin America and Europe and from time to time they fly us to certain destinations for training, etc ... This time they let me take my family and I wanted everyone to be prepared. Especially me. I couldn't be happier.  This course is so fast, easy and effective that even my five year old was running around saying phrases and speaking Spanish. My boss was impressed as well as my Mexican counterparts, some of whom speak English, and some who don't.  But in any case, it was obvious from their comments that I impressed them with what I was able to say and understand.  Everything I learned was in a three week period and from this course.  Need I say more?  This was more than I needed in the way of Spanish and was a true bargain. I highly recommend that you buy it and see for yourself.	2001-03-12

I found Audio Fluency French to be the most effective French course that I have yet experienced, and I have been searching and trying recorded French courses since 1972.  From my observations what makes this course unique is the method that teaches you to speak so much practical French within minutes of first using the course.  This course has improved my accent, increased my vocabulary, and shot my functional fluency sky high in just a few weeks. The tapes were more professional than the average with a relaxed tone which in turn helped me to relax.  The learning guide REALLY helped to clarify and explain, although I didn't really need it to look up English meanings since those are all given on the tapes.	2001-02-22

I would use it as a guide (I would just shove it into my shirt pocket)  on my trips to Mexico and Costa Rica.  No complaints about the course or the guide.

One of the biggest problems I encounter when I teach English to Spanish speaking immigrants is the difficulty they encounter in understanding the sounds and meanings of English words. 'Hablando Ingles Americano' is the only course we have used here which goes slowly enough for the reluctant uneducated learner to grasp the sounds and sentences structures necessary to read, write and speak English. The instructor on the tapes speaks very slowly and clearly and gives Spanish definitions for all English. The text is complete and has Spanish and English for all stories and exercises. It is the favorite tape program of my class and the favorite book. I therefore give this course an A plus based on the results we have all received from it.	2001-01-05

I have tried other language courses in a number of languages and it is my opinion that the Language Dynamics method is unequaled in speed and simplicity.  This is not to say that one cannot find more 'difficult' courses elsewhere.  Of course this is possible. But if you wish to learn the basics of German quickly and easily you'll never find a faster, easier, and more enjoyable way to do it.

I've had Language Dynamics' Speed Spanish for just over two weeks now and here's what I can now do.  I am able for the first time to speak and understand so much practical Spanish that I find it necessary to explain my experience to you in detail.  Understand that I am not a linguist.  I have gone to college and I consider myself reasonably intelligent but until now, learning a language has always been a scary and not too fruitful experience for me. Speed Spanish has changed all of that for me, thank God.  I bought Speed Spanish AFTER trying and returning Barron's Mastering Spanish, National Textbook's Teach Yourself Spanish, Living Language Spanish, and Great American Audio/Fast Track Spanish.  None of these had the exceptional METHOD that I experienced with Language Dynamics Speed Spanish.  The Speed Spanish tapes and Listening Guide &amp; Tapescript were versatile, relevant, had a very appealing and useful content, appropriate course speed, and was very relevant to my learning needs (which was to speak Spanish as quickly as possible).   Several of the other courses I listed were either horribly fast paced, used esoteric Castilian instead of the more common Latin American Spanish used in Speed Spanish, and were all just a rehash of the old 'mope and grope' stale language learning techniques your old high school teacher used to use.  I found these courss to be sterile and difficult to impossible to learn from. I found Speed Spanish to be excellent and unique in the following ways.  It was easy to go away from the tapes after each session speaking and understanding a great deal more Spanish than before the session.  The structure and method used in the course were so simple that the learning speed dramatically increased for me.  Sentence building, practical vocabulary, and even grammar were taught as natural part of the lessons so I hardly noticed as I learned it.  Most importantly, I am really enjoying learning from this course.  The interview teaching style foundon these tapes is quite pleasant, low key, and very effective! It is therefore my recommendation to you that you try Speed Spanish if you are interested in a one stop, multi-purpose, versatile, relevant, easy, very fast, and extremely 'user friendly Spanish course. If you are a linguist, enjoy guessing, want to learn only Castilian Spanish and aren't interested in IMMEDIATE RESULTS then you might try another course and still be satisfied. It is my humble opinion that there is no Spanish course on the market that can even approach the results Speed Spanish has gotten for me in just 2 weeks.	2000-10-28
