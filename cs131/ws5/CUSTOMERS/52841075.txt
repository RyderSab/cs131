US	52841075	R3SS1TE1CWP52S	0786860960	327415185	Sunset Express	Books	3	20	25	N	N	Crais goes on automatic pilot	I recognize that it's tough to keep pumping out \\"fresh\\" whodunnit detective novels as part of a lengthy series, so I'll cut Robert Crais some slack here.  The book is certainly a quick and engrossing read and there are enough little twists and turns (especially early on in the plot) to keep a reader turning the pages.  Crais is a gifted wordsmith and he adds just enough Los Angeles \\"local color\\" to provide the novel an interesting sense of place along with its story line. <br /> <br />HOWEVER--there is a fair amount of padding and gimmickry here, including the \\"troubled but made-in-heaven love relationship\\" with his lawyer sweetie from Louisiana.  This sideshow is not only derivative (reminds me too much of Robert Parker with Spenser's endless rhapsodizing about \\"Susan\\"), it really adds virtually nothing to the story.   <br /> <br />The plot itself is, as other reviewers have pointed out, essentially O.J. warmed over with a few twists.  Consequently, Crais has this time around taken the easy way out in crafting this novel through creation of a one-dimensionally \\"slimy bad guy\\" criminal defended by a \\"Green Machine\\" of Evil Rich Guy Svengali-like attorneys. Because of this, the essential plot line becomes discernible and predictable from a very early stage of the book; the rest is just filling in the paint-by-numbers.   <br /> <br />Moreover, I found Crais' editorial slant on all things Los Angeles to be irritatingly self-righteous and to my mind, unjustified, i.e., that wealthy liberal Hollywood celebrity types are invariably hypocritical and degenerate, that accusations that the Los Angeles police might, in fact, tend toward racism and procedural sloppiness are all merely rhetorical, etc. And the ending, aimed at evoking a fist-pumping \\"Yessss!!\\" from the attorney-hating reader, is just plain hokey. <br /> <br />Crais remains an above-average crime novelist possessed of a distinctive enough voice to render his books worth perusing when one is in the mood for a quick, literary-junk-food type read. However, by this, his sixth Elvis Cole novel there has developed a formulaic, predictable quality to his work that leads me to wonder whether I'll bother to get to the subsequent volumes in this series.	2004-12-20
US	52841075	RFBCSFEUO2X1V	052594821X	89678523	The Hundredth Man	Books	4	8	11	N	N	A promising debut	This is Jack Kerley's first crime novel, and I hope it's not his last.  In *The Hundredth Man*, he delivers a socko whodunnit featuring a varied cast of characters and a full spectrum of human foibles, perversions, and frailties.   <br /> <br />Stylistically, there is tendency toward the derivative here, something not unexpected for a writer who is still seeking his own literary voice. In his portrayal of the world and world-view of protagonist Carson Ryder, Kerley's writing is reminiscent of Michael Connelly.  In his narrative style and particularly his usage of descriptive language, I was reminded of James Lee Burke. On the other hand, certainly the story's geographical setting, Mobile Bay in Alabama, is fresh and different.  Overall, the novel's plot line works, being at once absorbing, horrifying, and surprising.   <br /> <br />On the down side, Kerley's portrayal of departmental in-fighting is a bit cliched and caricatured, and I don't think that Ryder's alcoholic love interest, Ava Davanelle, was sufficiently alluring (or even interesting) to make Ryder's nearly immediate devotion to her ring true.  The psycho-wacko basis for the serial murders that comprise the focus of the novel is certainly imaginative, but perhaps a bit overly contrived.  And finally, that Kerley wrote the novel with the \\"movie rights\\" firmly in mind is fairly obvious not only in certain features of the story line, but with the inclusion of the almost laughably cliched tough-but-loyal African American sidekick cop.   <br /> <br />Kerley didn't get everything right this first time around, but he offers here a highly readable and satisfying novel in his debut effort.  He is definitely is a writer to watch as he refines his literary technique in his future novels.	2004-12-08
US	52841075	R3O3S46YJ17LCX	1571781757	750715834	America 2014: An Orwellian Tale	Books	3	19	24	N	Y	A Great idea, but mediocre execution	There's lots to like about this book, particularly if you are among the millions of people who are experiencing post-election angst, including lingering doubts about whether or not George W. Bush's re-election was even legitimate. In *America 2014*, the author projects into the future current nefarious trends within the fundamentalist-driven, war-on-terror-preoccupied Bush Administration, and winds up with a nightmarish dystopian vision of America's future. Great concept! However, the book appears to have been hastily written, and after the first few interesting chapters it kind of degenerates into a fairly stale potboiler \\"thriller.\\"   <br /> <br />The author (I gather that Dawn Blair is a pseudonym) does a decent job of hypothesizing, in a kind of worst case scenario, where the current \\"war on terror\\" might lead our country.  Based on the obvious but still cogent observation that the \\"war on terror\\" is a fairly transparent Orwellian strategy for controlling the nation through xenophobia and fear, Blair posits that the \\"successful\\" war in Iraq will be followed by similar invasions of Iran, Syria, and Pakistan.  As the war expands the government becomes increasingly repressive, becoming overtly Christian in its declared theological orientation and even renaming the country \\"God's United States.\\" Trends toward totalitarianism  already implicit within the current Patriot Act become increasingly extreme with successive versions of the Act.  Bush overturns the Constitution and ends up running for a third and fourth term. \\"Foxy News\\" controlls all public information. The Orwellian future that so many of us have feared since the beginning of the War on Terror becomes America's reality. <br /> <br />This is the context for the story of the \\"new\\" Winston Smith.  In many respects the trajectory of this novel parallels that of the original *1984*, and this is obviously by design.  As an earnest attempt at an \\"updated\\" version of Orwell's classic, the book is worth a read.   <br /> <br />However, as fascinating as the book's concept might be politically, the novel falls flat as a work of literature.  The story comprises a hurried, cobbled-together romp of a plot line, and by just about any literary yardstick the writing is so-so at best. I also confess to being somewhat skeptical regarding the notion that youthful \\"punk hackers\\" would provide the backbone of the future Resistance movement.  But hey, anything's possible. <br /> <br />I suspect that the theme of \\"1984 becoming a reality\\" will inspire further novels by other writers as time goes on.  I suspect that some of these efforts will be superior to *America 2014*.  But \\"Dawn Blair\\" should at least be given credit for being first in line in turning this concept into reality.	2004-12-02
US	52841075	R3AR1U5BRLV53P	0898866685	855312837	Staying Fit Over 50: Conditioning for Outdoor Activities	Books	2	34	35	N	N	Someone else still needs to write a book on the subject	Not everyone will agree with me (I'm sure), but based on my own being a fifty-something male who is fighting Father Time as part of my never-ending quest to stay reasonably fit, I think that any book that purports to cover the subject of \\"fitness over fifty\\" needs to address the realities of what happens to the human body as it ages.  This requires more than a trivial reference to a few measurements of physical decline, including percentage loss of \\"VO2 max,\\" it demands frank and full  discussion of what it actually means to be aging and yet trying to remain athletically active.   <br /> <br />Here's the deal, like it or not: as we get older, we get more brittle, less flexible, more prone to gaining weight, and more prone to injuries, which in turn take longer to heal.  And on and on.  Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to be smart, prudent, and strategic in the way one approaches physical activities.   <br /> <br />A good book on this topic would devote a great deal of its contents to these realities of aging, and would serve as a guide to avoiding injury, dealing with various kinds of soreness and other age-related physical issues, and addressing the *psychological* issues related to the realization that one's body no longer can do what once it did.   <br /> <br />Instead, this book is, for the most part, just another general treatise on \\"beginning exercise,\\" with but a very few comments that might be helpful to 50+ people in particular.  In fact, the first part of the book is actually counter-productive, in my opinion, as its message is essentially the old \\"inspirational\\" saw about how \\"age is only a number,\\" etc.  Folks, this isn't true, and even the best-trained athletes over fifty years old will confess as much.   <br /> <br />Most of the book is a slog through \\"how to begin\\" various sports, including running, swimming, cycling, and cross-country skiing.  This information may be useful for people who absolutely have never done any serious exercise, but these sections are addressed to a general audience, with practically no information that is of particular use to an \\"over fifty.\\"   <br /> <br />With so many people who have exercised one way or another getting older, there remains a crying need for a book that actually addresses the issues that aging athletes will encounter as the years go by.  As the old saying goes, aging isn't for cowards, it's a tough process that has to be addressed head-on, not sugar-coated and pep-talked out of existence.   <br /> <br />	2004-11-21
US	52841075	R2XF41EAX1MOP3	0060596503	479838228	Whirlwind: A Novel	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A successful revival of the spy thriller novel	The passing of the Cold War dealt a severe blow to the spy-thriller literary genre, as cloak-and-dagger interplay between \\"western\\" and \\"eastern\\" intelligence agents became almost overnight an historical anachronism.  In *Whirlwind*, however, Joseph Garber manages to revive the spy novel by positing that in some situations, anyway, intrigue between American and Russian agents still might form the basis for a good story.  Overall, he succeeds in this endeavor, as *Whirlwind* not only is an engrossing page-turner, but the basic story line posited by the author is almost eerily plausible.     The basic plot that Garber weaves in *Whirlwind* involves the theft of an American top-secret weapon by Russian agents, but there is a lot more involved here, including distant maneuverings by the ever-ambitious Chinese, duplicitous U.S. government officials, for-hire [...] organizations, and on and on.  The story is inventive, filled with twists and turns that for the most part are convincing and authentically surprising, and there is even some psychological exploration of the major characters.  Overall, Garber's imagination, knowledge of the \\"spy business,\\" and his literary talents render this a truly good read for anyone who might enjoy this type of novelistic thriller.    The very nature of the \\"spy thriller\\" genre imposes limitations on the work as \\"literature,\\" however.  The main characters, while certainly interesting, are almost cartoon-like in their near-omniscience, their almost unlimited powers to cope with any situation, no matter how dire.  The female lead, the Russian agent Irina Kolodenkova, is, *of course*, gorgeous, blonde, brilliant, and almost infinitely resourceful.  The book's hero, the out-of-retirement CIA operative Charlie McKenzie, while unique in his advanced age, is all-knowing and James Bond-like in his powers, including his powers of recuperation from physical injury.      That these protagonists, and also villainous South African mercenary Johan Schmidt can miraculously and often instantaneously solve any problem and escape any threat becomes the literary device of choice for Garber. While this allows the story to move forward vigorously, it starts to resemble in places the ancient Greek dramatic institution of *deus ex machina*, whereby whenever decisive solutions were needed within a play the gods would descend from on high to resolve all problems. This \\"geez, these people can do ANYTHING\\" tendency might cause some readers to roll their eyes after a while.     Another issue that might be a bit off-putting is the preponderance of blood and gore that punctuates the novel throughout.  People squeamish about explicit descriptions of violence are hereby warned away.      I confess that *Whirlwind* is not the kind of novel I ordinarily would read, and yet I found it interesting and highly engrossing. The political/moral world-view revealed by Garber here is one that is cynical and hard-boiled, but in light of where trends seem to be taking us in the United States, I found his skepticism about political leaders and nation-states to be uncomfortably plausible.  Overall, it's a good read.	2004-11-12
US	52841075	ROXVW5ZJEZN70	0670033448	9843603	The Inner Circle	Books	4	60	66	N	N	A good read, but ultimately it falls a little flat	I look forward to each new novel by T.C. Boyle with great anticipation; he's a gadfly, an iconoclast who can weave a fascinating web of words filled with twists and turns and verbal pyrotechnics.  He can be impishly cynical toward social idealism of all types, as clearly expressed in *The Tortilla Curtain* and *Drop City*, but he also can show a softer, more sympathetic side, as demonstrated in what I consider his finest novel overall, *Riven Rock*.    As always, Boyle has created a novel that's at the very least, a good read.  I devoured this book, cover to cover, almost without stopping, which is a testament to Boyle's ability to write lucid, entertaining prose.  There is a noticeably a less manic feel to his writing this time around, however, and it's unclear to me whether this was a deliberate strategy, based on the sensitive nature of his subject matter, or whether instead Boyle found his inspiration just a bit lacking.    The fact that *The Inner Circle* deals with Alfred Kinsey and his pioneering work on sex research certainly makes the novel all the more alluring and addictive, I confess. Assuming that Boyle has taken only minor liberties with the actual historical characters of Kinsey and his wife Clara, the book illuminates in excellent fashion the motives, mindset, and methods behind Kinsey's single-minded pursuit of his research.  Boyle does (apparently) a fine job of depicting the character and personality of Kinsey, albeit from the virtually uncritical perspective of his narrator, the mild-mannered fictional research assistant, John Milk.      Frankly, to me the larger-than-life, hard-charging Kinsey comes across not as a \\"great man of learning,\\" but instead as something of a lunatic, almost a monster, a man with clear psychological pathologies that drive him to pursue his sexual research in a fanatical, single-minded fashion.  His research programme seemed to be based on the (to me) absurd proposition that humans are, after all, just like other animals in our basic sexual drive and its various forms of expression except that \\"society\\" \\"interferes.\\"  To me, this perspective is based on a fundamentally flawed conception of human nature, one in which an essential animalistic human core is simply overlain with \\"socialization\\" and its attendant hangups.  No; more accurately, human beings' most \\"animalistic\\" tendencies and behaviors are permeated through and through by culture, and so to try to strip away \\"socialization\\" to get at the \\"raw sexuality\\" is a project that is doomed not only to fail, but to distort badly the actual nature of human sexuality.    That Professor Kinsey (\\"Prok\\") expects his researchers (and their wives!) to drop all emotional associations with their sexuality to the point of partaking in ghastly quasi-public sexual performances reveals not a thoughtful scientific perspective tempered by empathy with his human subjects, but the fanaticism of a veritable sociopath, a bully, a proverbial control freak.  If this, in fact, is Boyle's intention in his depiction of Kinsey, he succeeds brilliantly.      However, what I found disappointing is that all other characters in the book, including Milk himself, come across as flat, shallow, and unmemorable.  By the end of the book the reader knows very little about the inner life and motivations of these people, even as the depths of their sexual lives are plumbed and chronicled, page after page.  What struck me as particularly wanting was Boyle's portrayal of the motives and mindset behind the \\"low level\\" homosexual inclinations of Kinsey, Milk, and the other male assistants.  Somehow, the way this activity (called \\"H-behavior\\") unfolds and the way that Milk, at least, experiences this doesn't ring true, and ultimately falls flat.      Furthermore, despite the often-fascinating passages dealing with the evolution of the Kinsey project, the interactions between Prok, Milk, Clara Kinsey (\\"Mac\\"), Milk's wife, Iris, and the rest of the principal characters, ultimately as a *story* the book moves along rather turgidly much of the time, and ultimately it doesn't really go very far.  The climactic scene, centering around conflicts related to Kinsey's megalomaniacal demands related to coerced public sexual performances by his assistants and their wives, is largely much ado about very little.  Then, shortly thereafter, the book just kind of ends.  I found this a bit disappointing.     Overall, this is not Boyle's best effort, but he's such a talented writer that even a near-miss by Boyle is likely to be better than the best writing of most other contemporary novelists.  If you've enjoyed his previous books or if you simply suspect that the Kinsey project makes for one heckuva fine subject for a novel, you probably will find *The Inner Circle* a satisfying read.	2004-11-04
US	52841075	R5MB5HA2F6GTB	0811843130	317964044	1906: A Novel	Books	3	74	83	N	N	Read it now, then wait for the film version	This is an absorbing novel that is commendable in some important respects, especially the fact that Dalessandro did some homework regarding many of the particulars of the actual story surrounding the 1906 quake and its aftermath. Overall, however, it's basically a made-for-Hollywood treatment of the earthquake that exudes sensationalism and is uneven in its historical accuracy.     Dalessandro includes much of the material unearthed (so to speak) by Gladys Hansen and other researchers regarding what actually happened on April 18, 1906. He reveals the actual casualty levels (several thousand deaths, at least), makes abundantly clear the stupidity of General Frederick Funston's overuse of dynamite as a means for creating a fire break, and spotlights the overt corruption that helped create the institutional context for a disaster that turned out much worse than it might have had the city been better prepared.      The author is at his best when he slips into his narrative this or that little historical anecdote or snippet about \\"old San Francisco.\\"  It's with regard to the minutiae of the pre-earthquake city, its politics and its cultural distinctiveness that the book clearly shows considerable research and preparation.    However, it's pretty clear that geology is not Dalessandro's forte, and the book includes a number of painful inaccuracies that will cause anyone familiar with the science of seismology to wince.  He conveys his geological information and insight through the inclusion of a character named Jeremy Darling, an assistant professor of geology at UC Berkeley.  On the train heading west, Darling explains to buxon Kansas runaway Kaitlin Staley that seismology studies \\"the subterranean movements of the earth's giant plates.\\"  Problem is, no one in that field would have explained earthquakes in terms of \\"plates\\" in 1906, as plate tectonic theory was not yet even a twinkle in any geologist's eye.      Later in the book, Professor Darling notices ominious precursors to a possible earthquake in the form of apparent \\"creep\\" along the San Andreas Fault.  He explains to protagonist and narrator Annalisa Passareli that such highly visible creep indicates that something \\"big\\" is about to happen, perhaps to the north (i.e., in San Francisco).  However, in reality, fault creep has no particular predictive value and, in fact, geologists are generally more concerned about \\"locked\\" sections of a fault where no apparent movement at all is occurring.      Finally, Dalessandro includes a strange passage in which a section of railroad being built up the Peninsula through the San Mateo County salt marshes is seen to have been twisted in an s-shape, indicating yet more dramatically the fault movement that foreshadows a possible huge break.  However, if there were such twisting of railroad tracks, it would have to occur directly across the fault itself, in response to the strike-slip movement of the plates.  The San Mateo marshes lie well to the east of the San Andreas Fault and west of the Hayward Fault, so what possible geological mechanism would cause them to twist into an s-shape?       I suppose only geological nitpickers will care about these kinds of inaccuracies, but it reveals a level of inattention to detail in the preparation of the book that I find annoying.      As for the presentation, Dalessandro includes some admirably colorful descriptive language and he keeps the story moving along in lively fashion, but he creates confusion by switching, often clumsily, back and forth between third person and first person narrative (the \\"I\\" being Annalise Passarelli).  At the end of the book he explains that this was, apparently, the style used by the famous reporter Nellie Bly,  This merely shows, however, that the mistakes of one writer can all too easily become an excuse for the mistakes of another.    As for the story itself, well, there are gunfights and fist fights and fallen women and Shanghai-ers and Enrico Caruso, and lots of descriptions of broken buildings, injured people, and the ever-spreading Great Fire. And the book's good guys are extremely good and the bad guys are REALLY bad.  Hey, the hero and the heroine fall in love and get married!  Indeed, there is no lack of action, and let's face it, the 1906 quake makes a terrific vehicle for a story.     If this is the kind of story you enjoy, this book is for you. Overall, I confess that despite its flaws I enjoyed it.  It'll make a terrific movie (made for TV, probably), and I definitely won't miss it.	2004-09-23

The sheer power and energy driving the story and the sparkling chemistry among the main characters (not just Scarlett and Rhett) allows GWTW to overcome its embarrassing romanticization of the pre-Civil War south, including its condescending and sanitized portrayal of the institution of slavery.<br /><br />Given the iconic stature of GWTW, it would be a daunting task for anyone to compose a sequel, so I picked up *Scarlett* with limited expectations.  Even those, however, were dashed quickly when I realized that this much-ballyhooed literary \\"event\\" was little more than a tricked-up bodice-ripper that probably would more appropriately have been published by Harlequin rather than Warner.<br /><br />The story here is fairly predictable, including the obligatory made-for-Hollywood ending.  Unfortunately, Ripley utilizes HUNDREDS of pages to tell this simple, meandering tale, and consequently the text seems bloated and interminable.<br /><br />The characters are simply not interesting enough to keep a reader's attention for such a long stretch. Scarlett herself is unrelentingly one-dimensional in her \\"Fiddle-dee-dee\\" shallow self-absorption, yet we are supposed to believe that she also has a steel-trap mind for business and that she is able consistently to \\"dazzle\\" men and women alike wherever she goes. The kind of irresistible charm we are told she exudes is from all appearences that of the high school prom queen or society debutante, and yet we are supposed to believe that even into her thirties this tiresome airhead act never wears thin.<br /><br />Certainly Scarlett's problems related to men and romance continue, and this is an aspect of the book that I actually found to be disturbing.  The \\"wanting what she can't have\\" theme from GWTW continues through most of the sequel; in fact, the main thread of the plot (may I give it away?) is the torch that she carries year in and year out for the perennially unavailable Rhett.  However, in the mature Scarlett O'Hara, long gone is any fascination with a sensitive, repressed type such as Ashley Wilkes.  No, in the wake of the infamous scene in GWTW in which a drunken Rhett \\"overpowers\\" Scarlett, the ideal man  for Scarlett becomes, forever more, the macho, domineering swashbuckler who takes command of every room he enters and effortlessly sweeps women off their feet (yawn. Near the end of the book, Scarlett almost consents to marry a veritably sadistic rich boor from England whose courtship style is essentially to grab and brutalize Scarlett, leaving her mouth sore from his \\"powerful kisses.\\" For a time, at least, her reaction to this treatment is (to paraphrase) \\"Golly, what a MAN!\\"<br /><br />Based on Scarlett's attitudes toward the male of the species, I can only infer that many women still find allure in the tragic but time-worn \\"Geez, he's an animal, but I can tame him\\" routine.  Hey, you've come a long way, baby!<br /><br />The book is not a complete disaster, however.  Readers interested in learning a bit about the customs and peculiarities of high society in Charleston and Savannah will be able to glean some historical gems from the text.  The author did do some meticulous research in this area, and credit should be given where it is due.  Similarly, some light is cast upon the culture of Irish-American immigrants in the early-to-mid nineteenth century, and the interminable portions of the book set in Ireland do provide some insight into the problems related to the British occupation of the Emerald Isle.<br /><br />Overall, however, the book is too long, too dull, too shallow, and too pointless to be considered a worthy sequel to *Gone With The Wind*.r the perennially unavailable Rhett.

US	52841075	R1HG3BII8DJKB5	140003180X	405618230	The Kalahari Typing School for Men (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, Book 4)	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Charming, but with a touch of condescension	I've read all four of the Alexander McCall Smith books centering on Mma Ramotswe and her No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and I plan on reading the fifth, so clearly (to me, anyway) there is something attractive, charming, and addictive about these little literary gems.<br /><br />The gentle wisdom of the main characters, the insights into human nature that are revealed in the succession of episodes, the often lyrical references to life, nature, and culture in Botwana, all of these things render Smith's books fun to read and at times spiritually uplifting.  This latest episode, featuring the professional and romantic adventures of Mma Rowatswe's trusted assistant, the typing prodigy Mma Makutsi, is every bit as charming and readable as the first three books in the series, so one cannot say that Smith is losing his touch as he cranks out book after book.<br /><br />There are, however, some troubling aspects to this series that I confess have come to bother me. Example: in his laudable effort to portray life in Botswana in a positive light, Smith's narrative at times takes on a kind of paternalistic tone, the subtext of which seems to be, \\"these people are simple, yes, but they are gentle, good, and in a kind of salt-of-the-earth way, wise.\\"  A style that apparently seeks to keep the prose simple and accessible ends up making the characters themselves often appear childlike and one-dimensional, lacking in real human depth.  Because of this, I can see how these books have come to be so whole-heartedly embraced by rat-race-weary urban Western professionals daydreaming of a \\"simpler life and a slower pace.\\"<br /><br />This tendency toward flattening out the stresses and complexities of life in rural Botswana would be more forgivable were it not for the fact that this is the nation with the highest rate of HIV infection on the planet. This is a startling, sad, alarming reality that probably will surprise many readers of these books, and yet this overwhelmingly serious problem is mentioned only in passing within Smith's upbeat tales about lady detectives and dedicated auto mechanics.  I certainly don't expect the author to dwell in his stories upon this health catastrophe, but his failure even to allude to the problem seems to me an almost calculated part of his overall strategy of presenting a romanticized, sanitized, they're-poor-but-they're-happy image of life in Botswana.<br /><br />People who have read and appreciated all of the novels will surely interject at this point at least one, \\"Yeah, but...\\"  Noteworthy among these could be the fact that in a previous book the principal male character, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (always, cutely, referred to by this full title), is diagnosed with clinical depression.  Yes, this is strikingly \\"real to life,\\" certainly, but even here the simplistic, dumbed-down approach to human problems advanced by Smith emerges, as Matekoni's apparently severe depression is completely obliterated almost instantly through a simple presciption for antidepressant drugs.  Anyone familiar with the issue of depression knows that overcoming this malady is seldom so simple as is portrayed in Smith's novel.  But problems in Smith's Botswana tend generally toward rapid and total resolution, much in the manner of prime time television episodes.<br /><br />Still, I confess that I find these novels to be soothing and easy bedtime reading, and I'm sure I'll end up buying and reading the next one, despite my growing reservations about Smith's overall project.in passing within Smith's upbeat tales about lady detectives and dedicated auto mechanics.

Still, I confess that I find these novels to be soothing and easy bedtime reading, and I'm sure I'll end up buying and reading the next one, despite my growing reservations about Smith's overall project.	2004-07-15

This is one of those \\"blind men with an elephant\\" types of books in which each reader will perceive what he or she wants to.  Bush apologists will focus upon O'Neill's \\"disloyalty,\\" \\"hypocrisy,\\" \\"bitterness,\\" or whatever, whereas people suspicious of this administration's motives and methods will be tempted to elevate O'Neill to some kind of pedestal of forthrightness and honor.  The fact is, however, that whatever value this book might provide has very little to do with O'Neill's personal qualities, and everything to do with what is revealed about the shallowness, ruthlessness, and opportunism that motivate the Bush team, and for that reason people should read *The Price of Loyalty*.    Paul O'Neill is undoubtedly more candid, principled, and capable than the average corporate executive cum \\"revolving door\\" government administrator.  Maybe that isn't saying much.  But Susskind's attempt to elevate the gray, boring O'Neill to \\"action hero\\" status falls flat.  As I read passage after passage extolling O'Neill's personal virtues I found my eyes glazing over, frankly.  Moreover, if O'Neill is such a multitalented, literate, hardworking fellow, why didn't he write the book himself?  God knows now he has the free time.    Clearly, the book is a failure in its attempt to elevate Paul O'Neill to the status of world-historical figure.  However, based upon what he says, plus the documents that he has produced and which were shown on \\"Sixty Minutes,\\" I have no doubt that everything he says about George W. Bush and his policymaking apparatus is true.      And this stuff is scary, folks. Once upon a time it was supposedly just wacko leftists who claimed that Bush was obsessed, a priori, with conquering Iraq and turning over its oil fields to private companies.  O'Neill *proves* that from day one of the Bush administration, this was true.  Time was that only \\"Bush hating crazies\\" claimed that Karl Rove and Dick Cheney essentially call the shots for this administration, based upon a narrow focus upon \\"the base,\\" the conservative core of Bush supporters.  This book proves that this is true. And finally, time was that only embittered foes of George Bush claimed that he has little interest in deep consideration of policy alternatives.  O'Neill shows not that Bush is \\"stupid\\" (he obviously is intelligent in a kind of savvy, knows-how-to-manipulate-people way), but that true to his lackluster personal academic legacy, he cares not a whit for intellectual exploration, nuanced argument, or a careful consideration of the facts related to policy decisions.  Everything he does is based upon a kind of Machiavellian political calculus and being \\"true to principle,\\" and I mean this in a negative way, given the privileged, predatory nature of the Bush political \\"core.\\"    A major problem related to the \\"readability\\" of this book is that frankly, the best parts have been broadcast all over the tv networks and the Internet, and the rest tends at times toward the turgid and boring.  The most riveting passages, such as Cheney blandly commenting that \\"Reagan proved deficits don't matter\\" are now well-known; on the other hand, I found the long-winded discussions of things like corporate accountability policy pretty slow going.      Overall, I think it's terrific that this book has gained so much public exposure, because what O'Neill reveals here about the Bush administration is so damning, with the source of the revelations being not a Chomsky, Cockburn, or even a Carville, but a longtime pillar of the Republican establishment.  On the other hand, however, after reading the book I was just as indifferent to Paul O'Neill as a world-historical figure as I was before I began reading.	2004-03-11

American readers will enjoy the different cultural context and slant, including references to Italian politics, police practices, and cuisine. What's helpful here is a kind of glossary appended to the end of the book that will help American readers make sense of some otherwise obscure references.<br />The plot itself is well-structured, and the murder mystery is not unraveled until very close to the end of the story.  There also are some endearingly offbeat supporting characters, some excellently well-placed &quot;false leads,&quot; and a generous dose of dry humor.<br />The only drawbacks here are first, that just about any work of literature loses something in translation, and there are occasional odd-sounding passages that must seem far more eloquent in the original Italian.  And second, I confess that the cavalcade of minor characters sometimes confused me, as their similar-sounding names began to spin around in my head. There also are a fair number of murder mystery cliches included, such as the victim being a &quot;gorgeous blonde,&quot; etc.<br />Overall, however, this is a refreshing change of pace for fans of mysteries, and those interested in how the genre is treated in an Italian context will find it fascinating and satisfying.	2004-01-30

Given that murder and mayhem are endlessly popular, competition for readers' attention is keen. In light of the sheer numbers of crime novels that appear annually, it behooves an author to create a work that somehow stands out as uniquely memorable in terms of plot, characters, or literary style.  Unfortunately, Michael McGarrity's *Everyone Dies*, while certainly readable, ultimately comes across as just another gore-filled day at the criminologists' office.  <br />McGarrity, who apparently bases his writing efforts on real life experience in the field of criminology, displays a knack for weaving a tale of vengeance and criminal plotting that is clever, and at times even inspired.  His criminal investigators unravel the deceptions perpetrated by the villain in  sometimes fascinating fashion.  Also in his favor is the geographically intriguing Santa Fe, New Mexico, setting for this story.<br />Overall, however, McGarrity's literary efforts pale in comparison with other, better-established practitioners of the mystery-writing craft.  He includes a few riveting descriptive passages depicting place, situation, and mood, but his efforts pale when compared with those of a more gifted writer like James Lee Burke.  His protagonist, Kevin Kerney, simply isn't memorable or particularly interesting when compared to others, such as Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch, and his villain, a cartoon-ish lout who calls himself Samuel Green, lacks the psychological depth that someone like Dennis Lehane would likely provide.  <br />There is an excess of gratuitous blood and gore, and the case ultimately is wrapped up in too much of a hurry, almost in &quot;made for tv&quot; fashion.  I also found the strong &quot;family values&quot; angle featuring Kerney's pregnant wife and long-long son to be cloying rather than truly touching.  <br />Overall, this is a quick, easy read that will keep most readers turning the pages.  Perhaps that's enough.  But whereas McGarrity certainly demonstrates some talent for mystery writing in this book, there are so many better writers out there that I would hesitate to recommend this novel to my friends.	2003-10-14

Boyle: a fascinating torrent of words and images saturated with a cynical wit that can both amuse and annoy.<br />This time around Boyle has chosen what has become an all-too-easy target, those silly, misguided, fog-brained communal west coast hippies of a generation ago.  Readers looking for a \\"balanced\\" or nuanced portrayal of the communards will not find it here.  Boyle's style is to lampoon and even sneer at his subjects, rendering them one-dimensionaly pathetic in their naivite and their self-delusion.  Surely all of the stereotypes Boyle has presented here are based upon real human types who populated the now mostly defunct hippie communes, but from my own experience as a young, starry-eyed hippie wannabe from that era, I know that many communes included wise, thoughtful, even heroic individuals, and yet it is clear that Boyle has little interest in this more positive aspect of the hippie legacy.<br />To his credit, Boyle does demonstrate that a major cause of the communes' many shortcomings was that old axiom of small group sociology, \\"a few people spoil things for everybody.\\"  No matter how well-meaning most communards might have been, these institutions' lack of firm structure and rules rendered their arrangements vulnerable to all varieties of pathological and predatory individuals.  Boyle shows how both in northern California and in Alaska, one or a few rogue individuals were able to poison what otherwise would have been far more congenial social arrangements.<br />One of the most satisfying aspects of Boyle's rambling narrative is that clearly he did his research when it came to matters of space and place.  His portrayal of central Alaska, particularly its climate, landscape, and ecology is nothing short of superb.  One can almost feel the clouds of mosquitoes and black flies that plague anyone venturing out of doors during June and July.<br />*Drop City* is magnificent for Boyle's amazing ability to turn phrases and create vivid images.  The book is a terrifically entertaining read and there is hardly a dull moment throughout.  On the negative side, however, the characters tend toward the one-dimensional and the ending does seem to be both abrupt and arbitrary; I found myself disappointed as I finished the last page.

Books	4	2	6	N	Y	Appreciate this book for what it IS	Every year thousands, if not millions of baseball fans yearn for a book that will provide them with the past records of the hundreds of major league baseball players that appear in the games they watch live or on television (or listen to on the radio).  Who are these guys, where have they played in the past, and how did they do last year?  The BEST available currently published version of these data is *The Baseball Register*.  The book is reasonably compact so it can be carried to the ball game (even with the current ridiculous security restrictions on carry-in items).  It includes the information most essential to knowing &quot;at a glance&quot; how good a player has been.  It also includes information that some of us, at least, find interesting, including school affiliation, minor league records, and transaction histories. All in all, this remains THE book for baseball fans to buy and then keep handy during the baseball season.<br />No, the Register is not perfect.  There always are additional pieces of information that people will want and yet are not made available here, including which outfield position a fielder played (the book simply lists &quot;OF&quot;) and fielding putouts and assists (eliminated this year to make room for additional batting statistics).  People who enjoyed and relied upon the STATS baseball handbooks clearly are disappointed that much of the information previously contained there is not provided in The Register.  But I find this stance and the associated angry disapproval unreasonable.  Fans who want a reasonably compact register of players are NOT going to lament the lack of stats on batters' hit by pitches, pitchers' WHIPs, and &quot;career projections&quot; as a major catastrophe.  <br />Yes, it's too bad that the STATS handbook apparently has gone the way of the dodo and something should come along and take its place (actually, there are computer disc compilations of stats that are VERY comprehensive and affordable).  In the meantime, however, the typical baseball fan will definitely find the *Baseball Register* to be useful, enjoyable, and well worth its low price.	2003-03-03

Preston and Child keep getting better, particularly in terms of character development, intricacy of plot, and the inclusion of detailed historical and scientific material that renders the book more than merely first-rate entertainment.  <br />The sections dealing with the geography and culture of 19th century Manhattan are rivetingly terrific, and as far as I can discern, factually accurate. Similarly, the thematic matter relating to that curious institution called &quot;cabinets of curiosities&quot; is informative and fascinating.  <br />The plot itself is fabulously laden with twists and turns and surprises.  There are points in the story where I thought I had the trajectory of the novel all figured out, but Preston and Child proved me wrong.  Indeed, they succeeding in maintaining the tension and anticipation right up until the very end of the book.  <br />The one flaw I encountered is that as surprising as the ending/resolution of the story turns out to be, it ultimately didn't seem to me quite satisfactory.  No spoilers here, however, so I shan't say more except to add that the book is well-crafted and entertaining enough to overcome this single weakness.  <br />For those of us who love mystery/thrillers grounded in science and history, the works of Preston and Child have become required reading.  This book leaves me awaiting even more eagerly their next novel.	2003-01-29

I say, \\"Bravo!\\"<br />*Isle of Dogs* is readable, funny, and even informative, what with the historical lectures penned by \\"Trooper Truth.\\"  The characters range from the pathetic (the governor's youngest daughter) to the sleazy (the crooked dentist), to the grotesque (the she-devil, \\"Unique\\"). I do suspect that the book will seem funnier and more topical to readers familiar with Virginia history and culture, but even for this Californian there were plenty of laughs.<br />The only real weakness in the novel is that the plot is eminently lightweight and is clearly secondary to the tongue-in-cheek tone Cornwell endeavors to create.  Consequently, I found that while it was an easy book to pick up, time and again it also was easy to put down.  In other words, it's not exactly a \\"riveting page-turner.\\"  Still, *Isle of Dogs* is a fun and easy read that showcases Patricia Cornwell's diverse talents.	2003-01-13

Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus were shrewd enough to perceive that well over a decade after Tom Wolfe's *A Bonfire of the Vanities,* another literary skewering of ultrarich New Yorkers would find a receptive audience. Unfortunately, these two young women possess nowhere near the literary talents of a Tom Wolfe, and the result is mildly absorbing but in the end, annoyingly shallow.<br />Certainly it is fun to frolic through this new indictment of the galling self-absorption of the superwealthy, and I have no doubt that there are people in Manhattan very much like \\"Mr. and Mrs. X.\\" That many among the superrich treat their offspring mainly as expensive possessions to be cared for by disposable, poorly paid employees is undoubtedly true. However, it's all too easy to forget that in a work of fiction authors can make up the characters, plot, and details any way they like. McLaughlin and Krause chose to create cardboard cutout villains with \\"you may hiss\\" veritably tattooed on their foreheads. Whereas I certainly don't mind seeing the power elite raked over the literary coals, I am confident that the reality of nannies and nanny-hiring New Yorkers is actually somewhat more complex than the presentation in this novel suggests.  <br />Another problem is that the protagonist, \\"Nanny,\\" is herself not particularly likable. Yes, yes, she is admirably dedicated to the child for whom she cares, but aside from this there seems to be little \\"there\\" there. Her complete inability to deal with her employers in an assertive manner quickly becomes annoying, and her essential shallowness is evidenced by her instantaneous infatuation with a winsome young man apparently simply because he is a \\"Harvard Hunk.\\" <br />So is there a political or social statement lurking here somewhere?  Yes, but it's one that is sadly meek. Sure, we all resent arrogant would-be aristocrats like Mr. and Mrs. X and we would like to fantasize that REALLY they are miserable, but ultimately most of us envy their money, lifestyle, and connections and do absolutely nothing politically toward reducing their power and privilege. This novel utters a kind of pseudo-populist squeak of protest against the excesses of the upper classes, but I suspect that shortly after the book is put down, most readers daydream more about joining the ranks of the ruling elite than they do about closing the huge and growing gap in wealth between the superrich and the rest of society.	2003-01-01

His strong points are his ability to create vivid descriptive language and his ability to capture the essence of certain character types that undoubtedly can be found in rural New England. Sometimes his earnest attention to detail betrays him, however, as his attempt to include elements of New England natural history fall flat (e.g., his placing of a Snowy owl in the middle of a dense forest--highly unlikely).<br />That Eric Rickstad is young and still learning is evidenced, however, by the curious pacing of the story.  The first half of the book \\"sets the stage\\" for the events that follow, and at times the substitution of description and nuance for actual story line becomes bothersome. During last half of the book, however, the action, including generous doses of blood, gore, humiliation and heartbreak, is practically nonstop.  Ultimately, the book's plot resembles pulp fiction more than it does \\"great literature,\\" and the \\"coming of age\\" theme is eclipsed, sadly, by the book's sizable body count.	2002-12-15

Michael Connelly has put Harry Bosch into retirement (at least for the time being) and has taken a different direction in his latest suspense-filled whodunit.  There is a crusty police detective who plays a major role in the story and there are cryptic references to previous story elements from the Bosch novels, but the principal character this time is a scientist-entrepreneur who is the founder of a high-tech startup company trying to develop \\"molecular computer\\" technology.  His own troubled personal and family history provides the psychological basis for a fascinating, nightmarish, but at times inplausible journey through the darker side of the Internet pornography industry, one that involves murder, betrayal, greed, terror, etc.  <br />Despite certain features of the plot that demand of the reader a certain \\"willing suspension of disbelief,\\" the book succeeds in drawing in the reader and keeping those pages turning. Once I started *Chasing the Dime* I almost couldn't bear to put it down.  Connelly is an adept and skillful writer who displays keen attention to detail in weaving his plot and who is able to keep his readers guessing as to what will happen next right up until the highly cinematic climactic scene.  The Hollywood-esque conclusion leads me to believe that Connelly wrote this book with the eventual film rights in mind.  Hey, who can blame him? <br />Overall, it's true that Connelly's most recent books are not quite on a par with his best earlier work (e.g., *The Poet*, *The Concrete Blonde*, etc.), but he is such a terrific writer that anything he publishes continues to be well worth reading.	2002-11-09

However, his fictional depiction of the enduring appeal of Stalinism as a possible threat to the (so-called) democratic reforms in Russian society is certainly provocative, and his insights into the internal workings of Stalin's mind and the terrors of his regime make for fascinating reading.<br />There are some sections of the book that drag a bit, but overall, Harris succeeds in creating a slow buildup of tension that keeps the reader turning the pages right up until the final sentence.  His depiction of his characters and of geographical locations is skillful and convincing, and overall, the book is impressively well-written.  For people interested in historical fiction related to Soviet and Russian history, this book definitely makes for a fine \\"summer read.\\"	2002-07-25

Brock is transported from contemporary San Francisco to 1869, where he encounters the first great professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings.  The resulting story is engrossing and is chock full of information and lore concerning the early years of our national pastime.  As a bonus, Brock writes perceptively about social and cultural customs and attitudes from this earlier time, and this renders *If I Never Get Back* more than just another baseball yarn. The romantic aspect of the story borders on the corny at times, but within the context of the overall novel a bit of schmaltz is certainly forgivable. All baseball fans with an interest both in good reading and the history of the game will enjoy this book.	2002-07-19

Mann's ability to draw in his readers and keep them riveted is reminiscent of well-known mystery authors like Michael Connelly, and this is definitely high praise.  Where writers like Connelly surpass Mann, however, is in their ability to construct a complex mystery that presents twists and turns that keep coming throughout the novel.  Mann's story is intriguing, but ultimately, the resolution of the mystery (i.e., the identity of a serial killer) is (disappointingly) simple. The ending is a bit theatrical, which is also something of a flaw.  <br />Overall, however, this novel is gorgeously written and once started is hard to put down.  Maybe &quot;gorgeously&quot; is an inappropriate word here, since some of the book's descriptive vividness relates to horrifying imagery related to corpses and murders. This story is definitely NOT for the squeamish.  Having greatly enjoyed *The Season of the Monsoon*, however, I definitely plan to read others in the Sansi mystery series.	2002-07-18

In *The Lady of the House* he captures the fears, confusion, shame, and anger experienced by struggling divorcee Jessica Turner after she is captured by kidnappers who mistakenly believe she actually is a wealthy homeowner. King does a fine job of drawing his reader into the *experience* of the horror and degradation that a kidnap victim experiences at the hands of her captors. <br />No spoilers here, but the trajectory of the plot once this kidnapping has occurred offers virtually no real surprises, no unexpected twists at all. I found the plot structure a bit flat and predictable, and therefore disappointing. I also think there was an opportunity here to explore further the experiential and psychological backgrounds of the criminals portrayed here Who are these guys and how did they become so desperate, crude, and antisocial? King offers a few clues but more material in this vein would have added depth to the novel. <br />Still, overall this is a gripping, well-presented story by an author from whom we can expect fine additional works in the future.	2002-06-30

In these times of wars on terrorism and terrorist wars, this story emphasizes that even the most superficially frightening political fanatics ultimately are human beings with personalities, hopes, dreams, and reasons why, and for that reason alone the novel is well worth reading.  <br />In terms of style and texture, Patchett has endeavored to compose a work that is lyrical and \\"magical,\\" and she largely succeeds in creating an ethereal, dreamlike mood throughout.  As such, however, the degree to which readers ultimately will embrace the novel depends upon their willingness to engage in a \\"willing suspension of disbelief.\\" Those possessed of any significant degree of skepticism regarding the actual nature of political struggle, small group social psychology, and human behavior generally will find much about which to be dubious, beginning with the notion that ALL of the guerrillas would be mesmerized by Roxanne Coss' operatic singing. They also will look askance at the romantic interludes portrayed here, including the prospect of romance between a superstar American singer and a staid Japanese businessman.  Furthermore, the lack of substantive political content is striking and to me, disappointing.  It would seem that a lengthy confrontation between desperate rural guerrillas and cosmopolitan luminaries would reveal more insights regarding the social and economic bases for radical grassroots rebellion (and ruling class repression) than Patchett offers here. I must also join the chorus of voices rising in protest against the tacked-on ending, which is just plain horrible.  <br />Despite these flaws, this bookis a well-crafted and thoughtful work that once started is hard to put down.	2002-06-14

But above all else Roth deals sensitively and skillfully here with historically troubling matters related to racial identity and the ways in which the tragic legacy of American racism forced some individuals to sacrifice family and heritage for the sake of personal advancement.<br />In telling the fascinating but sad tale of Coleman Silk, Roth also shows a commendable ability to &quot;put himself inside the heads&quot; of various American character types, including the post-traumatically stressed Viet Nam veteran and the scarred and jaded female victim of childhood molestation.  All in all, Roth has created a densely woven novelistic tapestry in which lives that have been shaped by variously dark, troubling, and yet irresistibly potent American cultural and political forces intersect in fascinating and sometimes surprising ways.<br />Some readers surely will find the book too densely written for their taste, as Roth tends regularly here toward a manic, unrelenting, stream-of-consciousness style in which sentences can seem never-ending and paragraphs can extend over pages. To appreciate this book requires immersion, concentration, and a willingness to surrender to the prose, to go along for the sometimes wild ride on which Roth takes the reader.  There are some sections that seem a bit slow-moving, especially portions of the chapter which delves ever more deeply into Coleman's Silk family background in East Orange, New Jersey.  Overall, however, I found the book absorbing, edifying, and sometimes ever exhilarating, and certainly brilliantly written by one of America's master novelists.	2002-05-16

In terms of the quality of the writing, the development of some (not all) characters, and the plot line *most* of the way through, Connelly once again delivers a tight, gripping, fascinating book that is hard to put down.<br />However, I confess that I was keenly disappointed in the book's ending.  I expected some final twists and turns in the plot that would tie together some definite loose ends, but these never materialized.  No spoilers here, so I will simply have to declare that I felt in more ways than one, the way the story concluded  was disjointed and unsatisfying.  This has rarely been the case previously with Michael Connelly's novels, and this renders my disappointment doubly keen.   <br />Another problem is that *City of Bones* reveals very little about Harry Bosch's personality and personal history, and so readers who have not read the previous Bosch novels will surely not find the protagonist nearly as interesting as those who have several books' worth of previous character development to fall back upon. There are cryptic references to Bosch's past here and there, but Connelly seems to assume that he is writing for an audience that already knows his character, and this seems to me to be a mistake.	2002-05-04

Anyone interested in the fate of the world's wild creatures and yes, the fate of the world itself should read it and will likely enjoy it. <br />David Quammen does an exemplary job of leading his readers through almost two centuries of significant ideas and debates related to \\"island biogeography,\\" a subject which is a lot more interesting and certainly a lot more significant than it might sound.  Begining with the fascinating story of the Darwin vs. Wallace story vis-a-vis \\"who really came up with the theory of evolution first?\\" Quammen goes on to explain and illustrate just why the biogeography of islands is so important to any consideration of biodiversity and wildlife conservation for the world as a whole. <br />In weaving this historical narrative, Quammen doesn't just encapsulate theories (though he does this in some detail), he takes his reader into the field where the sometimes abstract principles behind diversity/rarity/extinction are actually demonstrated through the predicaments faced by various creatures. Quammen ventures to the Aru Islands, the Galapagos, Madagascar, Guam, Tasmania, Mauritius, Barro Colorado Island in Panama, the Amazonian rain forest, and on and on.  It's a veritable world tour of places where rare and endangered animals struggle for existence in a world where human encroachment is causing an alarming acceleration in the rate of species extinction.  <br />Through his mostly fascinating discussion of places, species, and biologeographical theories and the people behind those theories, Quammen shows an unusual ability to restate abstruse ideas in clear and understandable terms.  He also writes with humor, a gentle and humane world-view, and an excellent eye for empirical detail.  <br />For me, the most painful chapter was \\"Rarity Unto Death,\\" in which he recounts selected stories revealing howvarious animals (and peoples) have been lost to extinction. The discussions of the extinction of the dodo and other wild creatures are terribly sad; the horrifying tale of the demise of the Tasmanian aborigines is heart-rending and infuriating.<br />In the end, Quammen's workmanlike effort establishes a \\"big picture\\" demonstrating how small, isolated ecosystems render their wild inhabitants increasingly vulnerable to extinction. We come to see that the biological notion of \\"islands\\" applies increasingly not just to small land bodies surround by water, but to more and more of our continental ecosystems as they are  carved up into isolated pockets of habitat through human encroachment and development.  Indeed, increasingly, the world's ecosystems are composed of various kinds of \\"islands,\\" a situation that threatens to result in catastrophic losses of biodiversity over time. <br />That the situation is not entirely hopeless for all creatures is shown by the remarkable, human-aided recovery of the Mauritius kestrel, rescued in recent years from the very brink of extinction.  But certainly the message overall delivered by Quammen is not a comforting or upbeat one. <br />In a book of this length and scope, there inevitably will be sections that particular readers may not like.  I found the chapter on theorists McArthur and Wilson a bit pedantic and boring in places, partly due to the very abstruse nature of their mathematical theories.  However, it also irked me a bit that Quammen took such an awe-filled, uncritical attitude here, particularly in his worshipful presentation of his audience with the Great Man, Edward O. Wilson.  Wilson is a towering figure in the history of biology and biography, certainly but a few words of criticism might have been in order here.  Yes, the leftist activitists of the mid-seventies were out of line in pouring water on Wilson's head at a scientific meeting and their accusations toward him vis-a-vis his theories of sociobiology were shrilland excessive.  But the truth is that some of Wilson's human-related \\"speculations\\" in the final chapter of his book on sociobiology *were* overreaching, inappropriate, and yes, foolish, and he deserved some of the criticism he received.  In providing a discussion of the furor raised by the  mathematical grand theorizing proposed by MacArthur and Wilson and other scientists beginning in the sixties, Quammen also could have pointed out that the often emotional debate over \\"mathematical modeling\\" vs. \\"detailed, real world empirical research\\" took place (and in some ways, continues) not just in the biological sciences but in a large number of academic fields. Whereas it's easy to dismiss extremist critics of truly useful mathematical models as narrow-minded or antediluvian, the proliferation of derivative, marginal, and in some cases, fairly useless \\"quantitative models\\" has at times threatened to eviscerate various fields of study, emptying them of virtually all attention to empirical detail and rendering them arid and lifeless. <br />I also was just a tad disappointed in the book's final section, where Quammen pays all too short shrift, in my view, to the question of \\"so what?\\" as it relates to the ongoing loss of world biodiversity.  He makes the point that human encroachment is creating mass extinctions, but really doesn't drive home his thoughts as to why urban dwellers with no plans to visit the rainforest or the Galapagos should really care.  I guess to Quammen the tragedy represented by this trend is self-evident, but what's really frightening to some of us is just how easy it is for people to live out their lives without ever having to give a darn about these broad, long-term issues of biodiversity.  The question, \\"Why should people care?\\" needed at least a bit more attention, I think.  <br />Overall, however, this is a fine, readable, well-crafted, and wonderful book.

US	52841075	R3586CMJ43VUC9	1585421499	571325266	Hope's Edge: The Next Diet for a Small Planet	Books	3	96	122	N	N	Hopelessly hopeful, and maybe that's the problem	Frances Moore Lappe has nothing more to prove to anyone, as her considerable contributions to humanity are beyond all doubt.  When she first published *A Diet for a Small Planet,* her messages related to the wastefulness of a meat-centered food system were stunningly revolutionary.  The materials she has contributed since related to the myths surrounding world hunger have also been marvelously convincing, and well-researched.  Bravo to her!<br />In this updated version of her first and still highly important work, Lappe (and her daughter) have updated much of the alarming information related to  politically perpetuated malnutrition coexisting with obesity, wasted grain, and the ecological perils of an food system dominated by large corporations.  There are new vegetarian recipes, as well, and that's terrific.<br />However, there comes a point where some portions of the same old message can become hackneyed and even tiresome.  The truth is that despite the contributions of Lappe and others over the past few decades, the world food system actually has moved in the wrong direction.  More people than ever want to consume a meat-dominated diet, there are more dangerous chemicals than ever being dumped into our ecosystems, and the massively capitalized, juggernaut-like genetics engineering initiative rolls onward,  positively frightening in its Frankenstein-esque implications.  <br />So where is the \\"hope\\" in all of this?  Lappe and her daughter try to inspire us by describing a small number of positive food-related experiments from around the world.  These are interesting, and the authors describe them from a first-person perspective in lucid and entertaining fashion.  <br />However, what I find irksome is the notion that we readers actually are supposed to find a \\"basis for hope\\" in these pitifully isolated activities.  The truth is there always will be a few visionaries/eccentrics/social rebels who will devote themselves to experimental projects that appear \\"revolutionary.\\"  This has been true for decades, if not centuries. How significant is this really, however, in light of the overwhelming trends that are carrying us in the opposite direction?<br />One reason for my Scrooge-like attitude here is that I am quite familiar with one of the examples used, the \\"Edible Schoolyard\\" at King Middle School in Berkeley, California.  One reason this project is so exuberantly ballyhooed is that it is the brainchild of the Infallible Alice Waters, who has delivered Exquisitely Pure and Pricey food for the toney elite at her Chez Panisse restaurant for decades now.  The truth is that whereas the Edible Schoolyard is interesting and provides a modicum of educational value for some middle school students, it is largely irrelevant even to life-in-general at King Middle School.  Students there are just as addicted to fast food and junk food as kids anywhere else, and the number of students whose lives are \\"changed\\" by this project is strikingly small.  <br />I suspect the same is true of the rest of these projects, as well.  There inevitably are a few purehearts who are True Believers, plus a few others who take note and make some marginal changes in their own lives.  But overall, these \\"hopeful\\" experiments are almost pathetic in their overall irrelevance to the mainstream world food system.  <br />My quarrel with the authors, then, is not with anything in particular regarding their research, their overall choice of topics, or their goals (which are laudable, certainly!)  No, I take issue with their almost desperately upbeat tone/message with its absurdly naive-seeming dosage of \\"hope\\" based on consumer gestures, tiny organic experimental plots, and tasty vegetarian recipes. I can just visualize millions of well-fed Americans feeling sooo good about themselves and the global future based on their new-found allegiance to Chez Panisse cookery and a vow to swear off Big Macs. This simply will not do.<br />Given the horrors of what's going on politically and economically in this world currently, it might well be time for more exhortation toward basic political activism and hard-nosed resistance to the machinery of corporate domination, and less clinging to the false \\"hope\\" provided by tiny edible schoolyard plots in Berkeley.	2002-03-29
US	52841075	R1P4J2O0IYOBR7	0679769781	831998889	We're Right, They're Wrong: A Handbook for Spirited Progressives	Books	3	30	34	N	Y	Clearly dated, but still filled with gold nuggets	This book was published as a piece of pro-Clinton [information] during the 1996 presidential campaign. Consequently, there is a certain datedness to much of what Carville has to say, plus a generous dose of campaign rhetoric extolling the virtues of the Democratic approach to (domestic) government policy. In truth, Bill Clinton is presented as far more of a populist progressive than was actually the case. <br />So why should anyone read this book now, nearly six years later? First, James Carville is a smooth-talker who entertains as he explains. His down-home, aw, shucks approach to the issues would almost have you forget what a shrewd political tactician he has proven to be. If nothing else, he does an excellent job of explaining what the Democratic Party has purported to stand for since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt, i.e., the notion that government has a proper and constructive role to play in regulating business, providing basic human services, and providing a \\"safety net\\" for people who suffer misfortune as a result of economic setbacks, natural disasters, or just plain bad luck. He also provides much useful and carefully laid-out descriptions of some of the more successful government programs that unfortunately, people in this country have either forgotten about or have come to take for granted. <br />The context for Carville's book back in 1996 was the attack on \\"big government\\" by Newt Gingritch and the rest of the conservatives who swept into Washington in 1994, purportedly with a mandate to fulfill a \\"Contract With America.\\" Although it turned out that they had no such mandate at all, for a time it seemed to be almost universally accepted that \\"government does nothing well\\" and that \\"liberal\\" is a dirty word. Carville's spirited defense of those things that government HAS done well succeeds in demonstrating just how shallow and yes, self-interested the reactionary attack on many useful and constructive programs actually was. <br />Given that Newt and his crew largely faded away from the front pages during the latter portion of the nineties, what is the importance of Carville's treatise now? The truth is that the current administration is proving to be the most conservative in recent history; consequently, it apparently has every intention of accomplishing through the executive branch what it was unable to accomplish through the legislative branch a decade ago. Because the events of September 11 and beyond have demonstrated that government does matter and can do some things well, the rhetoric associated with this new conservatism is somewhat different from what we heard from Newt and his allies. However, the basic theme of pro-corporate pandering to the ultra-rich remains the same. Consequently, much of what Carville says in this book regarding the regressive and reactionary nature of much of the agenda of the Republican right remains absolutely on target. For that reason alone, people interested in politics and government will benefit from reading this book.	2002-03-26
US	52841075	RYPG56LDG5NLU	0312283571	433898447	Trials of the Monkey: An Accidental Memoir	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Quirky, uneven, but fascinating memoir	In this unusual \\"accidental memoir,\\" screenwriter Matthew Chapman capitalizes on his genetic endowment as a great-great grandson of Charles Darwin by \\"revisiting\\" the 1925 Scopes trial in Dayton, Tennessee.  The result is a loosely-woven and sometimes frustratingly fragmented book, but one that definitely is worth reading.<br />As suggested by the title, the book purports to be above all else a reflective review of the Scopes trial and the attendant social, scientific, and religious issues surrounding it.  Here the results are uneven. He provides historical background on the principals involved and then fills a lot of pages with a recap of the trial gleaned directly from the court transcript.  This makes for some interesting reading, but people already familiar with this historical episode will find little here that is novel.<BR> <BR>He fleshes out his coverage of the Scopes trial by exploring the continuing Bible-thumping fundamentalism of contemporary rural Tennessee.  Since he is an intelligent fellow with a sharp wit and an impressive endowment of \\"street smarts,\\" Chapman presents some keen insights regarding the nature of, appeal of, and (mostly) shortcomings of Christian fundamentalism.   His observations regarding the ironies of rampant social pathology amidst pretentions of born-again evangelism in the contemporary rural south are spot-on and effectively presented.  <br />Overall, however, he clearly is no scholar and his obvious native intelligence is sometimes betrayed by lapses into intellectual laziness.  In providing background for the trial, for example, he reviews the career of the star witness for the prosecution, \\"The Great Commoner,\\" William Jennings Bryan.  He points out that Bryan's \\"Cross of Gold\\" speech at the Democratic National Convention of 1896 was a masterful piece of oratory, but then declares, \\"I don't understand the economic principles behind the speech and probably it was hogwash.\\"  Ouch.  The issue of the remonetization of silver as ameans of increasing the money supply, loosening credit, counteracting the devastation deflation of the previous two decades, and raising agricultural prices is not particularly relevant today, but understanding its importance to farmers and other \\"common folk\\" over a century ago requires little more than a quick perusal of an American history book.<br />What renders this book particularly unusual (in both a good and a negative sense) is that it turns out to be far more than a re-examination of the Scopes trial from a personal perspective.  Chapman actually alternates narration of his Tennessee experiences with deeper autobiographical reflection in which he reveals his troubled childhood and the tribulations of his depressive, alcoholic mother.  His writing here is sensitive and definitely confessional; in the end, however, this aspect of his \\"memoir\\" is not adequately integrated with his material related to the Scopes trial.  Despite the obvious double meaning of the title with regard to just what &quot;monkey&quot; might be on trial in this book, it almost appears that he has written two separate narratives that have been shuffled together like a deck of cards.<br />Along the way, Chapman reveals himself to have been one mean, sociopathic kid, and I hope that this literary confessional has had the desired cleansing effect for his troubled soul.  However, I kept wishing that in discussing his early nastiness he might succeed better in recapturing his youthful mindset, thus providing some real insights into the \\"lived' nature of adolescent pathology.  He confesses, often in excruciating detail, but provides few real insights in this regard.<br />Given that this is Chapman's first book, it's not surprising that what emerges is a real hodge-podge, a disorganized romp through time and space that in the end does not quite hang together.  However, since he clearly is an interesting, witty, and insightful fellow, there is much entertainment and information to be gleaned from its pages, and I am very glad I read *Trials of the Monkey*.	2002-03-06

The author and illustrator have taken some of these animated figures and have shown how to develop drawings by breaking the overall process down into three stages.  <br />The first step is to get the basic shapes/perspectives correct, and then the details are filled in over the next two steps.  This is a tried and true approach to drawing, but for some of the more complex characters even the very first \\"perspective and shapes\\" sketch is kind of difficult for kids to do correctly.  Consequently, I think that an additional, even more basic stage/step might have been helpful.<br />My son reports that he's happy with the book because it includes Krool and Link, the personalities he most wanted to draw.  At only 32 pages, however, this short guide clearly is not comprehensive, and there is no guarantee that a particular Nintendo personality a child may have in mind will be included here.  Still, overall, this is an extremely useful book and certainly the only one of its kind.  My son has already spent hours in deep concentration practicing his sketching, and I think that in itself is quite an endorsement of the work offered here by Mr. Teitlebaum and Mr. Zalme.	2002-03-05

Today, however, there are many, and the competition between them for birders' purchasing dollars is keen.  I tend to buy just about any book that bills itself as a \\"guide to the birds of North America,\\" however, so I recently picked up Fred J. Alsop III's new Smithsonian Handbook.  There is much to appreciate and enjoy here, and I can recommend the book as a welcome supplement to anyone's basic bird guide collection (especially people living the western states).  However, by itself it is adequate neither as a guide to bird identification nor as a supplemental source of information about bird habits and natural history.<br />This book is long (752 pages) and definitely hefty.  No one but a true masochist would consider carrying it into the field.  Consequently, in terms of helping with bird identification, this guide at best can serve as a supplement to other current field guides.  In this capacity, the book will indeed be useful with respect to many birds.  Each full-page treatment of a species includes lots of useful information, including key field marks, range, vocalizations, distinctive behavioral habits, nesting habits, and even flight patterns.  <br />The key to whether or not this works for particular types of birds lies in Alsop's approach to bird illustration.  Here, he relies mainly upon high-quality photographs.  For most birds, particularly songbirds, this works adequately.  However, as is just about always the case with bird guides illustrated with photos, the results are uneven.  Some of the photos are spectacular, but a few are so-so.  What's more important, however, is that Alsop's reliance upon a single large photo for each bird precludes adequate illustration of species for which inclusion of more than one picture is essential.  This mainly includes species for which flight patterns are important, including gulls, terns, pelagics, hawks, shorebirds, waterfowl, swifts and swallows, and nightjars.  This adds up to a lot of species. <br />Traditional field guides also provide additional illustrations to show immature or fall plumages.  Alsop does try to include additional illustrations for some of these plumages, but these extra drawings mostly are so tiny as to be virtually useless.  For some species, at least, he would have done better to limit some of the verbal information to accommodate more space for these additional illustrations.  <br />One of the strengths of the book is Alsop's obvious commitment to providing the reader with information pertaining to each bird's behavior, nesting habits, and population/conservation.  Because the author is combining this effort with identification material, however, the book doesn't measure up to certain others in terms of being a complete \\"natural history guide.\\" <br />To his credit, Alsop includes some extra materials that are welcome and well-done.  There is a section on extinct species (including the Ivory-billed woodpecker, which apparently may not be extinct after all), and also some \\"how to's\\" on birding as a pastime.<br />Overall, however, I can recommend this book mainly to people who really enjoy owning lots of bird books.  A good strategy for birders generally is to purchase one (or more) good field guides for identification purposes, and then to supplement these with another good book that provides natural historical information.  This volume certainly has its uses and contains lots of excellent information, but in trying to be both identification guide and natural history guide, it doesn't truly succeed in either function.	2002-03-01
US	52841075	R29URJICGB12OL	0553580515	417245650	Passage	Books	3	14	22	N	Y	Fascinating topic, so-so novel	Connie Willis is an imaginative and cogent thinker who, in terms of the themes she explores in her novels, stands head and shoulders above most other writers in the pulp-dominated world of science fiction.  The problem, however, is that her inspiration is undermined by literary skills that are average at best.  In *Passage*, she takes on the fascinating topic of near death experiences and presents some creative insights and hypotheses.  With the exception of a few widely spaced exhilarating sections, however, her writing is disappointingly pedestrian; the result is a novel that seems bloated and frequently dull.  <br />Willis' principal characters function adequately to convey her story and message, but they are of the cardboard cutout variety.  With the exception of the precocious, disaster-obsessed young heart patient, Maisie, it's difficult to care about any of them.  <br />But what's worse is the lackluster nature of her prose. Some writers can carry along even a weak story line simply through an ability to conjure images, capture characters' internal ruminations, and string together words and phrases that transport the reader into a different world.  Willis is not one of these writers. <br />What renders this lack of literary sparkle worse is that the book is far longer than it should have been.  Readers are forced to slog through six hundred pages of a saga that could more effectively have been communicated in three or four hundred. Time and again, Willis tantalizes the reader with some bit of information or \\"secret\\" that we KNOW will eventually be revealed, but then she forces us to wade through page after page of laborious conversation and painfully detailed descriptions of character movements before she finally gets to the point we know full well is coming.   <br />The book suffers further from overused cutesy \\"running jokes\\" that soon become irritating, including \\"you can't get there from here\\" hospital architecture, the volunteer who is always too busy toparticipate in the study, the cafeteria that is never open, the man-chasing airhead nurse, and on and on.  <br />In her analysis of the NDE phenomenon, Willis demonstrates an admirable determination to stand up for science and against wooly-headed mysticism.  However, in presenting her own position, she ultimately comes across just as intolerant and dogmatic as the charlatans she opposes.  She uses her manuscript too freely as a bully pulpit to ridicule people who would disagree with her own scientific explanation for NDE's. <br />Her conclusions about the actual nature of NDE's seem breathtaking and yes, plausible.  However, Willis would do well to temper the zeal with which she promulgates her view that near death experiences can (will?) be explained on the basis of their evolutionary function.  If one's premise is that biological/mental phenomena exist because they *must* have proven to have evolutionary value to the species, then it all too easily becomes a kind of parlor game to invent scenarios that support this notion. From there it's all too easy to become attached to these speculative explanations as \\"true.\\" <br />Not so fast, however. Some sophisticated contemporary Darwinian thinkers such as Stephen Jay Gould argue persuasively that not all biological phenomena have evolved or persisted because they have survival value.  Sometimes, strange traits simply tag along as part of a broader evolutionary package for reasons that are exceedingly complex.  I don't begrudge Willis a good story line, but I would have preferred that she exhibit at least a slightly more agnostic attitude toward NDE's than she reveals in *Passage*. The truth is that near death experiences remain mysterious, and Willis' interesting hypotheses notwithstanding, we may never really know why they occur.	2002-02-22

Author Dubus is a skilled and promising novelist, and he does a fine job of conveying the neediness, desperation, and self-destructiveness of all three of his main characters.  In weaving this tale of desire, greed, lust, anger, and overarching self-absorption, he succeeds in conveying some of the more wretched aspects of the human condition.  People who are looking for books with cheerful, uplifting themes had best look elsewhere.<br />The key to both the book's merits and its weaknesses lies in the literary device Dubus uses to tell his story.  He narrates the story through first-person accounts by the Iranian ex-colonel Massoud Amir Behrani and the troubled young alcoholic Kathy Nicolo, who emerge as rivals for the ownership of a bungalow home in \\"Corona,\\" a town which for all appearances is a pseudonym for the city of Pacifica, located along Highway One south of San Francisco.  Curiously, Dubos accounts for the perspective of his third main character, deputy sheriff Lester Burdon, through third-person narration.  <br />By fleshing out his story through the respective perceptions and motivations of each main character (sometimes going through the same events from each different perspectives, in \\"Rashomon\\" fashion), Dubos succeeds in drawing in the reader and in building suspense as the story approaches a climax which is predictably dramatic (although the particulars of how things end up is certainly not predictable).  <br />Where this storytelling approach fails is in Dubos' apparent inability to create a believable \\"voice\\" for his troubled female protagonist, Kathy Nicolo.  Whereas we are given every impression that Nicolo is a pathetic, relatively uneducated  woman with an addictive personality who perceives life through a hazy veil of bad memories, poor decisions, and low self-esteem, as a narrator she speaks with astonishing articulateness, employing a self-aware discursive style more characteristic of someone who is college-educated or better.  In other words, what we are being led to believe about the content of Nicolo's perceptions and experiences does not correlate well with the writing style in which this narration is presented.  Had Dubos presented Kathy in a voice more appropriate to her actual character, it would have made for a more compelling and powerful story. <br />Meanwhile, Dubos' presentation of Colonel Behrani is more successful, right down to the slightly formal, \\"in translation\\" nature of his use of verb phrases (e.g.,\\"She gave to me the book.\\") <br />Overall, this book is hardly pulp fiction, but neither is it great literature.  It's an engrossing and mostly fascinating, entertaining read that conveys some real insights into the foibles of the human personality.  *House of Sand and Fog* shows how great and terrible tragedy can ensue despite people's misguided perceptions that they have proceeded on the basis of righteousness and good intentions.	2002-02-08

And why not?  The basic idea is that you take a bunch of ingredients, throw them into the crock pot in the morning, and by dinnertime, voila--you have something hot, fragrant, and tasty.  And what's more, a lot of the foods cooked this way taste even better as leftovers.<br />The strength of this cookbook is in the sheer volume of recipes provided, and in their overall simplicity.  These truly are &quot;fix it and forget it&quot; types of dishes, including a lot of soups, chiles, and simple stews.  Surely out of the 800+ recipes here anyone who purchases this book will find enough winners to make it a worthwhile buy.  <br />Potential buyers should be forewarned, however, that this is by no means *haute cuisine*.  Lots of the recipes include generous glops of canned creamed soups, dry soup mixes, canned vegetables, &quot;American&quot; cheese, and other gastronomical abominations.  The point is, however, that there are so many recipes included that it's easy to skip over those and go on to ones that appear more promising.  <br />The bottom line is that during the short time that I have owned this book, it has proven itself incredibly valuable and useful. My wife and my family are very glad that I picked it up, and that I brought the ol' crock pot out of its previously semi-retired state.	2002-02-01

Musician, wife, and mother Elizabeth, experiencing an apparent midlife crisis in which she rebels against the routine dullness of her life, seeks out an extramarital affair. Elvira, Elizabeth's daughter and the narrator's tomboy sister, rebels against the expectations that she embrace traditional femininity, instead immersing herself in the all-male world of Civil War reenactment.  The story of how these manifestations of disobedience run their course is told by Henry, Elizabeth's seventeen-year-old son.  <br />As the story unfolds, Hamilton reveals her keen perception of the hypocrisy and falseness of much modern feminism.  She skewers Elizabeth for her narcissistic, self-serving, and ultimately self-destructive adulterous behavior.  Also, through the vehicle of \\"Book Club\\" discussions among a number of middle-aged women, she takes aim at the nonsensical, even poisonous nature of much of the blather that passes for \\"feminist discourse.\\"  <br />So far, so good.  Where the novel fails, however, is in the curious one-sidedness of its critique of the genders.  In contrast to the way in which much contemporary writing by women attacks patriarchy (especially that practiced by white men), Hamilton's principal male characters here can practically do no wrong.  They are unnaturally sensitive, thoughtful, wise, patient, and/or talented.  Perhaps the greatest weakness of all, however, is Hamilton's ambitious but failed attempt to narrate the story in the \\"voice\\" of a young man in his mid-twenties.  As other reviewers have suggested, in tone, style, and content, the narration resembles far more closely that of a forty-something woman.  <br />Despite its flaws, this definitely is a work worth reading.  What's more, there is plenty of grist here for the book club or English class discussion mill.  What is the symbolic significance of RichardPolloco's home being a Lincoln birthplace log cabin replica?  Of all the ways that little sister Elvira might \\"rebel,\\" why through Civil War reenactment?  I don't know the answers to these questions and frankly, I'm kind of glad I didn't have to spend any great length of time wrestling with them.  But for people who enjoy the literary-deep-meaning guessing game, I'm sure there's lot of potential for fun and excitement here.	2002-01-26

Writing in a simple, plainspoken style that is at once spare and highly descriptive, Haruf presents life on the plains by providing a series of vignettes involving a small but compelling cast of characters.  These include a high school teacher and his two young sons, a troubled teenaged girl who faces the uncertainties of an accidental pregnancy, and a hardworking pair of elderly bachelor brothers who are more comfortable with their cattle than with other human beings.<br />The stories that unfold in *Plainsong* are uncomplicated, and in the end, the conflicts and problems presented remain largely unresolved.  Some readers might find this disappointing, but Haruf's aim here is to to weave a narrative that reflects the ambiguous realities of real life, rathen than to present a didactic morality tale with a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending. <br />To my mind, the most significant characters in the novel are the McPheron brothers, the aging bachelor ranchers who have spent their entire lives on the same plot of land.  The brothers take in the pregnant Virginia Roubideaux, instruct the two young Guthrie boys in the ways of cattle ranching, and in general come to represent all that is good, hardworking, straightforward, and generous within the culture of the rural great plains.  In some ways, in fact, their earnest, honest nature render them &quot;too good to be true.&quot;  <br />On the other hand, Haruf explores the darker side of small town life by presenting Tom Guthrie's wife as a hopeless depressive and by forcing Guthrie to face every teacher's nightmare, an evil-minded, disruptive student whose parents maintain that their child can do no wrong.  <br />The earnestly unadorned style of presentation is an effective vehicle for capturing the book's small town American subject matter.  There are, however, aspects of the literary texture created here that are, in fact, unorthodox.  The best example is Haruf's presentation of dialogue without any use tarditional  quotation punctuation.  This is no mere gimmick, as this innovation complements the rhythm and cadence of the writing, rendering the overall presentation more effective.  <br />Over three hundred enchanting pages, *Plainsong* succeeds in depicting a narrow, declining, and too-often forgotten slice of Americana.

US	52841075	RN7FE1QX2L07R	014027166X	210313938	Riven Rock	Books	5	22	23	N	N	Brilliant historical fiction	T.C. Boyle writes with a manic energy and a sardonic edge that render each and every page dazzling, riveting, and thoroughly enjoyable. He felicity of expression is matched by few of his contemporaries among American novelists (Jonathan Franzen, Tom Wolfe, and John Irving come to mind for me). Consequently, no matter what subject matter he chooses, his books are always a joy to read.  <br />Boyle apparently encountered the historical basis for *Riven Rock* soon after he moved to the Santa Barbara area some years ago. Yes, Stanley McCormick, the tall, handsome youngest son of the legendary inventor of the mechanical reaper, was indeed schizophrenic, he did indeed marry the wealthy socialite Katherine Dexter in 1904, and he did indeed spend most of his adult life locked away with doctors, nurses, and attendants in a palacial Montecito estate.  In *Riven Rock*, Boyle takes the historical misfortune that was the McCormick-Dexter marriage and transforms it into a fascinating story that is at once tragic, bizarre, and pathetic, and yet which is also riddled with sometimes unexpected touches of humor.  <br />The humorous veneer to this otherwise tragic tale stems from Boyle's skills as a savage social critic with an unerring eye for the foibles that are part and parcel of the human condition. Having already caricatured the faddish American cult of health and nutrition in *The Road to Wellville*, Boyle here lampoons the pretentions of early twentieth century psychiatry and in a broader way, the overall vapidity of upper class life and discourse.<br />And Boyle does so much more.  By complementing his principal upper-class historical personalities with a supporting cast of purely fictional working class characters (most notably the handsome, testosterone-driven attendant Edward O'Kane) Boyle also is able to reveal the broader foibles associated with the American &quot;war between the sexes.&quot;  <br />This steady sprinkling of sardonic humor related to pompous doctors andthe hopelessly clueless womanizer O'Kane, however, is in the end overshadowed by the tragedy that marks the real life story of Stanley and Katherine.  Stanley's incurable insanity, Katherine's youthful inability to recognize the extent of his affliction, and her subsequent noble but futile willingness to sacrifice on his behalf makes for a truly heartbreaking story that ultimately can have no storybook ending.  Moving adroitly back and forth in time as he weaves a narration that spans decades, Boyle is nothing short of brilliant in the way he reveals, bit by small bit, the extent of the pathos that characterizes this saga.<br />Overall, this is an engrossing and rewarding novel that shows T.C. Boyle to be one of the most gifted and creative contemporary American novelists.	2002-01-14

There is just enough scientific content pertaining to virology and various cybernetic phenomena to rank this a cut above the typical action &quot;thriller,&quot; and the authors' descriptions of the bleak, arid New Mexico setting is superbly presented. I also enjoyed the inclusion of a Bill Gates-like computer nerd-turned-megalomaniacal businessman as an antagonist who interestingly, is not &quot;all bad.&quot;  Certainly there is a requirement for the reader's suspension of disbelief in certain places, but that's why we call it &quot;fiction.&quot;  <br />The one element of the story that is irritatingly hackneyed is the all too predictable inclusion of a brainy young female who happens to have lovely, long legs and smoldering violet eyes.  Keeping one eye to the potential of the book as Hollywood material, the authors also made sure to include a kind of absurdly gratuitous sex scene toward the end of the book.  Ho hum.  Otherwise, this is a smart, creative, and well-presented novel that is sure to keep its readers turning the pages in anticipation of what happens next.	2002-01-02

It's no secret that the story revolves around what unfolds when three men accidentally stumble upon a plane that has crashed with millions of dollars in cash on board.  The bulk of the book explores the grim consequences of this discovery.  Despite the generally predictable and even formulaic nature of the plot overall, Smith has done an amazingly skillful job of creating a page-turner of a suspense novel that is nearly impossible to put down.  The particulars of just how things go awry for the various principals involved are spun out in ingenious fashion over several hundred extremely well-written pages.<br />This book not only tells a gripping (and sometimes gory) tale of how a seemingly &quot;simple plan&quot; goes awry, it also provides clear insight into the darker side of the human condition, that is, how under particular circumstances even seemingly &quot;nice, normal people&quot; can end up committing and rationalizing the most heinous deeds, always with &quot;good reasons&quot; behind their actions.  The way that Smith lays bare the fragility of human ethics and morals sadly rings true, and renders the book as depressing as it is horrifying and suspenseful.  Overall, it's a terrific read that should not be missed.	2002-01-01

I had high expectations for this book, what with its Pulitzer prize credentials and its gorgeous multicolored cover featuring the Empire State Building.  And although I would certainly not claim this is a poor novel, when I finished the book I felt a \\"Is that all there is?\\" kind of disappointment.  With its \\"golden age of the comic book\\" subject matter and its potentially interesting mixture of characters, I thought that this lengthy saga would indeed feature some \\"amazing adventures.\\"  But aside from the early-on Golem escape episode and Joe Kavalier's riveting but all too brief WWII Antarctic odyssey, this novel is actually pretty dull fare overall, with an ending that is downright flat.<br />I suspect that a lot of the appeal of this book stems from its incorporation of a veritable potpourri of fashionable topics and themes, encompassing thirties and forties New York City arcana, the emergence of the comic book adventure story as a popular institution, Houdini-inspired magician's artistry, Jewish mysticism, struggles with issues of homosexual identity, escape from the shadow of the Holocaust, and on and on.  This was potentially \\"socko\\" fare, and yet overall, the prose and story line plod rather than soar.  Michael Chabon is certainly a talented writer, but here his style lacks sparkle; that he peppers his pages with obscure, word-of-the-day two-bit nouns and adjectives throughout (e.g., \\"lucubrations,\\" \\"capacious,\\" \\"soi-disant,\\" etc.), hardly makes up for an absence of the kind of imaginative, powerhouse writing that can transport a reader into a different world.<br />I'm sure that with its thematic threads involving  &quot;imprisonment and escape\\" and its heavy-handed invocation of the Golem/superhero metaphor throughout the book, there is much fare here for meandering English class discussions regarding \\"symbolism\\" and such.  But this kind of guessing-game deconstruction of novels has never appealed to me; I prefer direct, imaginative story-telling that keepsme turning the pages as I read and has me re-experiencing the imagery that leaps from the pages long after I have closed the volume for the last time.  Sadly, this book inspired neither experience for me.	2001-12-22

More than a few &quot;hard-boiled&quot; detectives are themselves traumatized Viet Nam veterans (Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch comes to mind), and the variously shady aspects of American involvement in that unfortunate nation, from drug-smuggling to war crimes are shown through the vehicle of crime fiction to have consequences for countless people even decades after American involvement in the war in southeast asia finally ended in the early seventies.  <br />In this short but fascinating novel, Ruth Birmingham makes her own contribution to this *corpus* of post-Viet Nam mystery literature through the quest by her protagonist, Sunny Childs, to discover the fate of her long-lost father, who reportedly was killed mysteriously in Viet Nam, and yet his name does not appear on the Washington, D.C., Viet Nam Memorial.  Why?  <br />The story is imaginative, complex, and sometimes horrifying, and it successfully dredges up a lot of the most painful aspects of the Viet Nam war and its aftermath.  Once started, it's a hard book to put down.<br />The only real weakness of the novel is that its basic structure involves Sunny in a series of encounters with Viet Nam vets and other characters who in turn provide their own recollections of the &quot;real story&quot; of what happened in Viet Nam involving Sunny's father.  There is something of a &quot;Rashamon&quot; quality to the different perspectives offered by the various characters, and this makes for fascinating reading.  However, there is also a certain literary clunkiness to the way that this succession of narratives is set up.  Formerly taciturn characters suddenly launch into long and revealing monologues that seem in some cases really contrived. This structural flaw notwithstanding, the book is certainly fascinating andit contains some real historically significant insights regarding the history of American involvement in southeast Asia.  <br />Being familiar with the Atlanta setting for the story, I can also vouch for Birmingham's knowledge of that metropolis and its geographical intricacies.  Consequently, Atlantans especially will find Ruth Birmingham's work fun to read.	2001-12-06

What's most interesting about *Taliban* is that it is written from a non-Western, and especially non-American point of view.  Consequently, the author makes apparent that although the United States has blundered in its policies toward southern Asia, most of the principal causes of the problems in the region have to do with autonomous dynamics and conflicts with lengthy histories that have little or nothing to do with U.S. actions.  <br />Rashid first covers the history and trajectory of the Taliban movement up through 1999 or so, and then circles back to discuss various particular themes related to the rise and reign of this peculiar and in many ways frightening religious movement.  These include their draconian and inhumanly strict social agenda (particularly their horrendous treatment of women), the role of the drug trade and smuggling generally in Afghani (and Pakistani) society, the roles of various religious and ethnic factions within the conflicts afflicting the region, the wider set of geopolitical conflicts involving Afghanistan's neighboring nations plus the larger powers such as Russia and the U.S., and the important (and in the context of the post-September 11 war, suspicious) role of oil and gas-related intrigue in the dynamics of the region.<br />All of these topics are treated carefully and analytically by Rashid, who offers thoughtful criticism of just about all parties involved in the current mess.  Being Pakastini himself, he has perhaps the harshest words for his own government(s), who clearly were responsible for the rise of the Taliban beginning in 1994.  Rashid places Pakistani support for the Taliban within a broader campaign to increase Pakistan's influence in the region. Unfortunately, as the author points out, the Taliban has ultimately exerted more influence and control over Pakistan's domestic situation than the Pakistanis have been able to exert over Mullah Omar and the rest of the Taliban.  <br />The United States certainly is shown to share in the blame for the current problems afflicting Afghanistan.  It is well-known that the anti-Soviet war that began in 1979 was largely supported by the U.S. in proxy fashion through the Pakistani ISI intelligence agency.  After the Soviets left in 1989, however, the Americans simply lost interest in the Afghani situation and when civil war and chaos emerged the Americans did virtually nothing to help ameliorate Afghanistan's woes.  When the Taliban emerged in 1994 as a &quot;stabilizing influence&quot; for a war-torn nation, the Americans first considered supporting them, partly because it was believed the Taliban might be amenable to overtures by Unocal to build a pipeline through Afghanistan.  Only when the Taliban clearly showed its misogynist, barbaric character did the Clinton administration finally begin to condemn them.  By that time these &quot;religious students&quot; were already harboring Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda henchmen, thus setting the stage for the events of September 11 and since.  <br />Overall, *Taliban* is a fascinating but certainly depressing tale<BR>of international and interethnic politics at its real-life worst.  What emerges is a picture in which every nation, every religious denomination, every economic faction, and every ethnic group apparently acts purely out of short-term self-interest, with virtually no one exhibiting a willingness to respect the bigger, longer term picture or the &quot;greater good.&quot;  The American bombing campaign to drive the Taliban out of power in Afghanistan may seem heavy-handed and brutal, but within the context of the broader historical picture as portrayed by Rashid, it's apparently merely the latest version of &quot;business as usual&quot; in south Asian politics.	2001-11-24

What emerges is a picture in which every nation, every religious denomination, every economic faction, and every ethnic group apparently acts purely out of short-term self-interest, with virtually no one exhibiting a willingness to respect the bigger, longer term picture or the &quot;greater good.&quot;  The American bombing campaign to drive the Taliban out of power in Afghanistan may seem heavy-handed and brutal, but within the context of the broader historical picture as portrayed by Rashid, it's apparently merely the latest version of &quot;business as usual&quot; in south Asian politics.	2001-11-24

In *Unholy Wars*, reporter John Cooley has provided a wealth of information about Afghanistan and its geopolitical importance over the past quarter-century, including the 1979 Soviet invasion, the U.S.-supported campaign by the *mujahedin* to expel the Soviets, and the subsequent transformation of the most militant *mujahedin* into the Al-Qaida terrorist network led by Osama bin Laden.<br />Cooley succeeds in providing an admirably detailed account of the origin of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, including excerpts from the now-infamous 1998 interview with Zbigniew Brzezinski published in a French publication in which he boasted about having entrapped the Soviets into invading so that they would experience their own Viet Nam-type military disaster. The involvement of the CIA, along with Pakistan's ISI, in supporting and supplying the *mujahedin* is laid out clearly, and Cooley even devotes a chapter to the significance of the opium trade as a source of funding for Islamist armies both during and after the campaign against the Soviets. <br />Other chapters discuss how the multi-national Islamist &quot;freedom fighters&quot; dispersed after 1989 to spread their gospel of militant Islam and their terrorist tactics to Egypt, Algeria, Chechenya, the Philippines, and ultimately, the United States. The book was completed prior to the events of September 11, 2001, but the material dealing with previous Al-Qaida attacks in the U.S., including the first bombing of the World Trade Center, is vital reading for people interested in historical background to the current crisis.<br />The main problem with this book is that whereas Cooley presents a veritable blizzard of &quot;facts,&quot; there is very little accompanying analysis. The presentation reads like a first draft, a mass of semi-digested material in dire need of editing and refining. Particularly in the chapters pertaining to recent terrorist activities in nations outside of Afghanistan, the endless parade of names, dates, places, factions and parties will make even the most resolute reader's head spin. <br />Overall, the book seems to have been thrown together way too quickly, as evidenced by an appalling lack of careful proofreading or fact-checking. Examples of gaffes that should never have made it to the final galleys include the claim that California's Chico State University is located in Nevada, the declaration that the time period between 1956 and 1970 constituted 24 years, and a reference to the &quot;two 110-foot towers&quot; of the World Trade Center. Whoops! Aside from the obvious sloppiness evidenced here, the inclusion of these kinds of careless errors cannot help but cast doubt on the overall accuracy of Cooley's reporting in this book. <br />Given that so far there is but a handful of books in English that provide historical background pertaining to Al Qaida and international terrorism generally, I would say that Unholy Wars is definitely worth reading. We can only hope, however, that a more analytical and carefully written work on these subjects will emerge soon.	2001-11-19
US	52841075	RC324WHI5BFIH	0813334896	161778776	A History of the Modern Middle East	Books	5	72	86	N	N	Excellent background reading for all Americans	The Middle East is such a multi-faced region with such a rich historical legacy that even people who strive to be well-informed cannot help but feel bewildered at its cultural, political, and religious complexity.  Given the blustering aggressiveness of the post-September 11 U.S. policy toward the region, however, Americans owe it to themselves to become far more familiar with the complexities of the Middle East than has been our wont up to now.  <br />Popular magazine articles that attempt to &quot;explain&quot; Islamic rage as the result of a &quot;fear of modernity&quot; or &quot;jealousy of the west's freedoms&quot; may as well bear a stamp proclaiming their authorship by the &quot;Ministry of Propaganda.&quot;  As an alternative, I recommend Professor Cleveland's textbook, which serves as a brief but remarkably thorough introduction to the history of this volatile part of the world. <br />No, the book does not cover Afghanistan or Pakistan, but clearly political currents in these nations are closely linked with what has transpired in Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and the rest of the Middle East proper.  At the heart of the current crisis is, of course, the Israeli-Palestinian condundrum, and here the author's explanations and analyses are clear, balanced, and incisive.  His discussions of the evolution of Saddam Hussein's Iraq and the background *and consequences* of the 1991 Gulf War are also invaluable. In his recounting of the Iranian revolution, Cleveland offers a fascinating analysis of the apparent Islamicist rejection of &quot;modernity,&quot; showing that those in the Middle East who reject the West do not crave a return to the ancient past, but instead wish to follow a modernization pathway that is guided by indigenous cultural principles, including the precepts of Islam.  <br />Perhaps most impressive, however, is what Cleveland has to say toward the end of the book regarding the dangers of an overly intrusive and domineering presence in theIslamic Middle East by the lone remaining planetary superpower, the U.S.  He does not prophesy the recent terrorism that has afflicted this country, but he does criticize the U.S. for policies that seem to rely more upon aerial bombardment than careful diplomacy.  The application of Cleveland's conclusions to a reevaluation of the likely long-term consequences of &quot;America's new war&quot; is not a comforting process, but it's one that perhaps more Americans need to undertake.	2001-10-16
US	52841075	R35TYL3MLR9LJE	0374100128	647099960	The Corrections	Books	5	9	12	N	N	Definitely worth reading	Is *The Corrections* the long-awaited Great American Novel?  One cannot tell, given particularly that in this time of flag-waving patriotism there could not possibly be any agreement regarding what the themes or content of the GAN might be.  What Jonathan Franzen has created , however, is an engrossing, insightful, sardonically humorous journey into the heart of darkness that is the American nuclear family.  It's not perfect, but it sure is a satisfying read and definitely one of the better novels to emerge in this country in recent years.<br />Before I read the book, someone told me to expect a combination of the best of the writing styles of John Irving and Tom Wolfe.  That, in fact, turned out to be an apt description, so I will pass it along.  The tone is unabashedly derisory as he skewers the contemporary institutions of marriage and family with devastating skill.  Along the way, Franzen offers apt satire regarding other topics, institutions, and trends, including the arrogance and cruelty that underlie American economic &quot;globalization\\" and the jargon-riddled snake pit that is contemporary academia.<br />Franzen's deconstruction of the complex and often contradictory ways that family members perceive and manipulate one another is superb. He shows how beneath our veneer of alleged \\"maturity\\" we are overgrown children acting out emotional impulses borne of deeply buried wounds that are almost always opaque to ourselves.  Although much of what is presented in the novel demonstrates the pettiness and weakness that is apparently our lot as human beings, his message is not monolithically negative.  He shows that even the most bitter familial bickering can be punctuated by acts of devotion and loyalty, and reveals how even the most superficially insensitive characters (in this case, the father figure, Alfred) can surprise us through hidden acts of nobility.<br />Throughout, the writing is vivid and dazzlingly creative without ever becoming pretentious or impenetrable.  <br />This is a fine novel, but it is not without flaws.  Whereas Franzen demonstrates an uncanny ability to \\"get inside the heads\\" of various contemporary male types, I found his attempts to capture the inner lives of female characters to be less convincing.  In particular, the thoughts, emotions, and motivations of the Lamberts' daughter Denise did not seem authentic to me.  For the most part, Denise's often inexplicable decisions seemed calculated to advance the overall story line rather than to demonstrate any real insight into how a \\"contemporary American young woman\\" perceives herself, her family, or the world around her.  <br />Overall, however, this is one heckuva good read that once started, is hard to put down.	2001-10-10

Referring to the works of Jack Kerouac, Truman Capote once commented, &quot;That's not writing, it's typing.&quot;  The same could be said of Vernor Vinge's sprawling, bloated novel, *A Deepness in the Sky*.  I am guessing the novel won the Hugo Award on the basis of its grandiose plot structure and the sometimes fascinating application of certain scientific subthemes related to &quot;mind focus&quot; enslavement, microtransmitters, suspended animation, etc.  It's hard to imagine that the literary qualities of this book were considered strong points.  The sloppiness of the writing suggests that the author simply pounded out this work without a lot of concern about its internal cohesiveness or readability. Historical digressions churn on and on; characters that the reader should reasonably have forgotten about suddenly reappear in confusing fashion.  Were Mr. Vinge working with a good editor, the book could easily have been two hundred or more pages shorter, while still delivering a lot more impact to its readers.  <br />As for the story itself, it's certainly ambitious and interesting in its interweaving of three distinct civilizations, two human and one arachnid.  There are marked differences between these cultures, and I applaud Vinge for his imaginative creation of a culture related to the improbable pulsations of an &quot;onoff star.&quot;  Overall, however, the book suffers from the usual pitfall of science fiction, i.e., that all of the cultures and characters are pretty much &quot;contemporary white western folk&quot; with the technological and cultural *similarities* between the cultures ultimately far outweighing their differences.  The Emergents and Qeng Ho are supposed to be very different, but the alleged differences are actually quite minor.  Then there is the culture of &quot;spiders,&quot; but these creatures drive sports cars, feature a civilization dominated by &quot;corporations,&quot; and are remarkably &quot;just like us.&quot;  It is assumed from the start that the spiders' civilization will develop in linearly predictable fashion to resemble those of (all?) other previously developed technological civilizations.  This seems very narrow-minded to me, especially in light of the occasional scifi writers like Ursula LeGuin who have explored differences in basic cultural orientation, gender identity, and other anthropological factors as the bases for their thematic content.  <br />I applaud Mr. Vinge for his literary industry and for certain aspects of his thematic imagination.  But if this really represents the *best* science fiction novel of the year in which it was published, I despair of the current state of this literary genre.	2001-10-01

Edgar's story over the eight years that comprise the subject for this novel is fascinating, horrifying, engrossing, and oh, so human. It's certainly one of the most enjoyable books I've read in recent years, and for that reason alone I would recommend it. Yes, the style and tone are reminiscent of John Irving, which in term places Udall squarely in the storytelling tradition of Charles Dickens. The difficult-journey-with-tribulations-but-with-hope-and-human-virtues-always-maintained is certainly what we've got with Edgar Mint, starting with the very first sentence regarding how the mailman ran over his head. Udall writes with wit and an overall tinge of black humor, and right up until the very end of the book, Edgar's journey, while sometimes fantastic and unlikely, is certainly a fascinating one.<BR> <BR>My only quarrel with Udall (and the reason for my awarding the book four stars instead of five) has to do with the ending. I don't want to include any spoilers, but suffice it to say that the final chapter of the book includes a layer of warm-and-cloying that for my taste was laid on just a bit too thickly. Are we to believe that in a world in which schoolboys torture one another while the responsible adults sit by obliviously, where Native Americans drink themselves to death while regarding their own offspring with complete indifference, where people are forced to resort to the most horrifying crimes in order to ensure their own survival, suddenly life can transform into a never-ending succession of *Saturday Evening Post* covers? This kind of naively moralistic *telos* certainly worked for Dickens, but that was in a different time and literary context. At the conclusion of the book I felt warm and fuzzy and happy for Edgar, but the little voice inside me was protesting that in the context of 2001 this ending veritably screamed made for Hollywood, and I found this disappointing.	2001-09-09

That way, the individual stories take on greater meaning as part of the ongoing evolution of a principal character as he or she develops and changes. In light of this, it's tempting to recommend that prospective readers of James Lee Burke's Louisiana-based Dave Robicheaux series should start with *The Neon Rain*, which sets the stage for the numerous subsequent books. <br />Anyone who reads Burke's prose should be impressed by his unusual gift for verbal description. His ability to paint word pictures of places, characters, moods, and feelings is exquisite, and for this reason alone a reader might plow through the entire story. However, the plot construction of *The Neon Rain* is so anemic that I would not be surprised if many of those who read this New Orleans-based story simply refuse to go on to the subsequent stories set in New Iberia. This is a shame, since most of these later works are excellent mysteries in which the stories are far more complex and engrossing.<br />In this novel, and to some extent in all of them, Burke employs a formulaic approach in which his protagonist veers from crisis to self-inflicted crisis (in pursuit of righteousness and justice, of course), with the narrative invariably punctuated both by breathtaking descriptions of places and people (and also meals), and periodic episodes involving bloody mayhem. After a while it gets pretty predictable; in his later works, however, Burke develops story lines that are sufficiently interesting that he can make the formula work, at least most of the time. <br />It should be noted also that Burke demonstrates throughout his *corpus* an admirable sympathy with the downtrodden and disadvantaged both in America and abroad, along with a sneering dislike of the rich and powerful. This political aspect of his writing is certainly unusual within the detectivegenre, and for me, at least, is highly refreshing.<br />So, should people seeking a great detective novel read pick up *The Neon Rain*? Yes, but ONLY if they resolve beforehand to view it as a kind of &quot;prequel&quot; to the higher quality Robicheaux novels that follow.	2001-09-07

Preston and Child have developed a winning formula for science-and-myth-based thrillers, and this may be the best one they've released so far.  <br />Yes, the story IS formulaic, with some of the plot developments being forseeable right from the beginning.  There also are elements (such as a deranged Chilean destroyer captain) that strain credulity and ask the reader for a \\"suspension of disbelief.\\"  Despite this, however, there are enough twists, turns, and surprises to keep readers riveted.  The characters tend toward stereotype, but they do exhibit enough reflectiveness and personality to render them adequately believable.  Finally, the quality of the writing itself is far better than one finds in most potboiler \\"thrillers.\\"<br />As always with Preston and Child's efforts, one can certainly envision this book as a Hollywood production someday.  If *The Ice Limit* ever appears on the silver screen, I'll certainly buy a ticket.	2001-09-01

The premise of a high-level coverup on behalf of a nitwit Reagan-esque chief executive is promising, and oil speculators are (now, more than ever) people that we love to hate, but Grisham's execution of his story line is simply overly cliched, contrived, and plodding.  Once the basic dynamic of &quot;see Darby run, see Darby outwit her pursuers&quot; is established early on, the story bogs down for (literally!) a couple of hundred pages. We are beaten over the head with just how clever Darby is (especially for such a Babe), and with how nasty and Machiavellian the President's henchmen are.  We go from one locale to another and another, always just one step ahead of the hapless bad guys.  And--not to provide too much of a spoiler here-- it turns out that the *really* bad guy bears an eerie resemblance to the late Howard Hughes!  <br />Enough, already.  <br />Oh, one more thing:  just how many references to we need to Darby's &quot;long legs?&quot;  It actually might have been more refreshing and bold for Grisham to portray Darby as a plain, dumpy, but brilliant law student, but then, Julia Roberts sells more tickets at the box office, right?  <br />And there's the crux of the matter: I think Grisham wrote this story fully intending from the beginning that this would be turned into a movie, so in terms of characters, plot, pacing, and ending, the whole affair is unabashedly Hollywood-esque.  In fact, the book was made into a pitiably bad 1993 movie starring Roberts and Sam Shepard.  While I can't really recommend the flick, at least you'll be done with it in a couple of hours, tops.	2001-08-02

Certainly, it's a fun summertime read that moves right along and is seldom (though I can't say never)boring. As always, Irving creates some memorable and bizarre body-related imagery and a few weirdly endearing characters, such as the gum-chewing makeup girl, Angie.  The famous Irving dry wit manifests itself frequently, and there is enough worthwhile social commentary related to the predatory nature of the media and the overall foibles of human nature to render this book &quot;ok.&quot;<br />But compared with *The Cider House Rules* *A Son of the Circus* (an underrated jewel of a novel), *A Widow For One Year*, and even *The World According to Garp*, this book seems a pallid effort, indeed.  The overall premise/metaphor related to the loss of the protagonist's left hand seems labored and at times even silly; the characters on the whole seem wooden, unlikeable, and even worse, unmemorable; and the slightly sappy ending is all too predictable and Hollywood-esque.  I would add that Irving's main character, the handsome newscaster Patrick Wallingford, seems oddly bland for a guy who supposedly is irresistable to all women.  In fact, Patrick's seemingly effortless success at bedding any and all females seems to represent a male fantasy of sexual omniscience, the flip side of which is Irving's unflattering portrayal of just about all of his female characters as conniving and manipulative.  It's hard for me to reconcile Irving's strangely flat and unappealing lead characters with the supposed ultimate message regarding how love abides and conquers all.<br />This is certainly not a terrible novel. In fact, I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone looking for an engrossing few hundred pages to while away a few lazy summertime hours.  I suppose that like so many other people, however, I have come to expect a lof a significant writer like John Irving, and this work proved disappointingly lightweight.	2001-07-31

Having finished the book, I'm now soooo glad I didn't shell out any money for it, as it's one of the shoddiest novels I've read in a while.  I gather that when the mood strikes him Patterson can really write, but this book is just plain second rate.  The characters are one-dimensional, the writing is so plain and simplistic that a typical fifth grader could easily plow through the book in a few hours, and the story itself is unbelievably dumb.  There are some twists and turns in the plot that might provide some interest, but these are so implausible as to likely generate sneering scorn rather than excitement.  And what's up with writing books with a hundred or so two or three-page &quot;chapters.&quot;  Is this a comment on the contemporary U.S. attention span?<br />It seems that in this book Patterson was aiming squarely at the lowest common denominator, while at the same time hoping, perhaps that *Hide and Seek* would provide an ideal vehicle for one of those tear-jerking made-for-tv films (which now apparently are becoming extinct, thank goodness).  If this sounds like your kind of novel, then by all means pick it up and breeze through it.	2001-07-12
US	52841075	R8VC17ONIZO8E	0380977915	956907706	T2: Infiltrator	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Promising start to what could be a new scifi series	For those of us who have viewed the two Terminator films over and over and over again, the wait for the 2002 release of &quot;Terminator 3&quot; seems endless.  Consequently, the appearance of an alternative literary version of a sequel to the Terminator films is an exciting event, indeed.  Overall, Stirling has succeeded in continuing the Terminator saga in authentic and convincing fashion, and we can only hope that *Infiltrator* is the first in a series of Terminator stories in book form.<br />I'm guessing that Stirling hoped that this story might provide the basis for the Terminator 3 film, as he has provided more than ample opportunity for Arnold Schwarzenegger to be featured prominently in the cast.  Unfortunately for Stirling, Linda Hamilton decided not to participate in the T3 project, so the prominent role of Sarah Connor in *Infiltrator* relegated this story to the realm of literature only.  Oh, well.<br />The world of Skynet and the Terminators is a complex one, filled with all kinds of time travel-related anomalies and contradictions.  Stirling has done a credible job here of fleshing out some of the mysteries of how the previous Terminator stories came to be, and he also advances the saga by suggesting that Skynet would create cyborgs, human/machine hybrids, that would help Skynet in its apparently never-ending battle to exterminate fleshupoid humanoids.  Stirling also suggests that misanthropic humans would aid Skynet in this effort, motivated by an ultra-&quot;green&quot; desire to rid the world of an ecologically destructive human race.<br />The resulting story is fast-paced, intriguing, and highly readable, and fans of all things Terminator owe it to themselves to add *Infiltrator* to their current &quot;must read&quot; list.  There are a few things about the book that I found bothersome, however.  For example, much of the plot depends upon some highly implausible coincidences, i.e., the appearance of an Arnold lookalike retired special agent right next door to Sarah and John's Paraguayan hideout.  There also is a thread to the story involving an ultra-green political extremist who resembles the Unabomber in some ways.  This subplot is interesting, but for the life of me I can't figure out what this character ultimately has to do with the story presented.  I suspect that in including this element Stirling is setting the stage for a future sequel to *Infiltrator*, and hurray for that.  Finally, the plot development definitely deepens some of the time travel-related anomalies to the point where thinking about them too much could cause migraines--so I recommend to readers just letting the fantasy wash over them; it's better that way.	2001-07-11

Cornwall has written a tongue-in-cheek farce that builds it appeal on the basis of its satirical excesses and goofy characters more than on the intricacy or plausability of its plot.  Personally, I think it works overall, and I enjoyed the ride through its 380 pages of silliness.  Whereas die-hard Scarpetta devotees apparently turn up their noses at *Southern Cross*, those who enjoy the mystery-with-humor subgenre exemplified by the works of Carl Hiaasen should consider giving this book a try.	2001-07-10

US	52841075	R18TIUZVUVUMMX	1588513513	202500840	Bloodsworth Island	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Interesting but flawed first effort by Slate and Rearden	In their first novel, Jeff Slate and David Rearden tackle the theme of the possible eugenicist uses of the current revolution in biotechnology.  Attempting perhaps to emulate the success of Michael Critchton in penning medical thrillers for a popular audience, Slate and Rearden weave a fascinating tale involving a secret Chesapeake Bay laboratory, an evil scientist with a cult-type staff of followers, the extermination of an entire village of Ecuadorian natives, and a confused but ultimately noble protagonist who attempts to right the wrongs he discovers.   All in all this makes for a quick and interesting read that might make it a fun take-along on a summer vacation.  At the same time, however, the novel emerges as disappointing in some fundamental ways. <br />What succeeds here is the apparent familiarity of the authors with various aspects of their topic.  Clearly Rearden knows a lot about the biological issues presented in the story, and consequently the discussions of the genetic markers associated with certain diseases are convincingly thorough.  The authors also are apparently familiar with the life and culture of some Ecuadorian natives, as the interaction between protagonist Gene Nolan and his native friend Hiaroma comes across as authentic.  The geographical underpinnings of the suburban Maryland setting for much of the book is certainly accurate and well-described.  Finally, the overall trajectory of the story is gripping enough to keep a reader's interest from start to finish.<br />Unfortunately, the book also reflects the inexperience of these authors as novelists.  The prose style is so basic and unadorned that I suspect any reasonably literate middle school pupil could race through the story effortlessly.  Some may perceive this as a virtue, but I found the simple, bare-bones style of writing to be disappointing.  <br />A second set of problems involves the authors' selection of a serious biological/philosophical issue as their central topic.  In portraying Marcus Gallaher as a latter-day eugenics mastermind, the authors have neglected to explicate  sufficiently the philosophical, social, and political themes and issues that would likely be associated with such a hypothetical figure. Gallagher's Bloodsworth Island laboratory is supposedly &quot;top secret,&quot; and yet it's clear that after one or perhaps two of his dastardly &quot;experiments&quot; resulting in large-scale body counts inquiries would be launched and there would be a significant reaction against any futher work of this kind. End of story.<br />The only possible way out of this quandry would be for the Bloodsworth Island effort to have garnered political muscle as part of some kind of broadly based movement.  Certainly neo-Nazi ties would make for glamorous thematic material, but portrayal even of the level of public support enjoyed by eugenicists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries would have made for a richer overall story. Is there a significant basis in our current American society for this kind of future political movement?  Exploration of some of of issues raised by this question would have made the novel far more socially relevant and very likely more frightening, as well.   <br />Overall, there is a striking lack of discussion of any kind of utopian (or dystopian) vision for a better future world that might contribute to Gallagher's alleged &quot;charisma&quot; among his followers.  The hold Gallagher exercises upon his underlings is cult-like in ways that are ritualistic and silly, in fact, rather than plausible.  And aside from his immediate staff, there is no 'movement' at all--thus, the potential for actual success of Gallagher's lonely efforts to &quot;rid the planet of genetically inherited disease&quot; would certainly be doomed from the start.  <br />Finally, there is a curious inclusion of some supernatural elements that include a fortune teller whose visions we apparently are supposed to take seriously  This, along with the sudden (and temporary) acquisition of magical qualities by a shamanistic totem from Ecuador don't really fit with the matter-of-fact scientific tone that characterizes the rest of the book.  It's almost a kind of &quot;deux ex machina&quot; to get the authors through particular portions of the story, or else they represent potshots against the &quot;hegemony of science.&quot;   To me, however, these were not convincing inclusions. <br />Despite the flaws in *Bloodsworth Island*, I will look forward to the next effort by these two young writers, as they have talent as storytellers and to their credit, they apparently wish to explore some scientific issues that raise serious ethical questions.	2001-07-02

Her protagonist, Sunny Childs, PI, is clever, feisty, and always interesting, and the story is well-plotted, full of interesing twists and turns.  <br />Birmingham succeeds in creating a tone that is hip and humorous and overall her style does resemble that of Sue Grafton.  There's certainly room for more great mysteries with female protagonists, though, isn't there?  It's also great fun to see a detective series set in Atlanta, a dynamic, cosmopolitan, and historic city.<br />The only drawback I found was the laborious &quot;let me tell you how I did it before I kill you&quot; passage toward the end of the book.  I suppose this is pretty standard fare for detective novels, but I would like to think that this feature could be minimized.  <br />Otherwise, congratlations to Ms. Birmingham for her inaugural effort.	2001-06-26
US	52841075	RT8X3RDNVLB2G	0385491832	352044771	Motherless Brooklyn	Books	3	3	7	N	N	Interesting premise, but a bland book	Jonathan Lethem clearly is a talented young writer, and his guiding concept in creating *Motherless Brooklyn* is promising, indeed.  I finished the book disappointed, however, as all three of its apparent main elements simply were not presented adequately.  <br />First of all, the book is supposed to be a different sort of &quot;detective mystery.&quot;  I cannot imagine, however, that fans of Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, or Sue Grafton would find the structure or plot of Lethem's mystery particularly gripping. No, this novel asks that readers be pulled along not on the basis of any edge-of-your-seat twists and turns in the plot, but because of its supporting literary aspects, i.e., its characters, descriptions of places, etc.  <br />Here again, however, I felt that Lethem came up short in *Motherless Brooklyn*.  His descriptions of &quot;life growing up as orphans in 1970's Brooklyn&quot; and then of contemporary Brooklyn generally emerge as remarkably bland and uncompelling.  Overall, his characters emerge as shallow and unmemorable.  <br />To me, both the most interesting and yet also disappointing aspect of the novel was the third main element of the book, Lethem's development of his protagonist, Lionel Essrog, whose affliction with Tourette's syndrome provides much, if not most of the book's actual content.  Lethem has surely done a fine job of capturing many of the details of the behaviors that a Tourette's sufferer exhibits, including the endlessly varied and creative verbal outbursts.  I comment Lethem for the research and care he evidently put into this aspect of his work.  However, Lionel ultimately lacks sufficient depth as a character.  He actually emerges overall as a &quot;regular guy&quot; who happens to suffer from uncontrollable tics.  I doubt that in real life, this would be the case.  To go through one's life being a &quot;human freakshow&quot; ALWAYS and to consequently suffer the scorn, ridicule, and uncomfortable reactions from others would, it seem to me, take a deeper toll on one's psyche than we see in Lionel Essrog.  The internal monolog that Lethem attributes to Lionel is surprisingly bland, and includes remarkably little *angst*, shame, frustration, or real human depth overall.  The Tourette's aspect of the book comes across ultimately as an interesting gimmick, and as such actually becomes a bit tiresome after the first hundred pages or so.<br />Overall, Lethem has created a highly readable work based on an original and unusual set of premises and circumstances, but his execution of his ideas proved disappointing to me.	2001-06-22
US	52841075	R101PUY20OVJN9	0440212626	860243922	Hard Fall	Books	3	4	4	N	N	The word for the day is &quot;potboiler&quot;	Ridley Pearson cranks out detective-thriller novels at a breakneck pace, and in doing so consistently demonstrates above-average skills in terms of crafting interesting plots that always include some exciting twists and turns.  He also manages to make his characters seem truly human, and to his credit, even goes to some lengths to &quot;get inside the heads&quot; of his female characters as well as the males, something that a lot of male detective writers simply fail to do.  <br />So far, so good.  The problem is that although Pearson is a decent enough writer, the overall style of his prose is very simple with almost a &quot;dumbed down&quot; quality to it.  I suspect that this is not because of any intellectual shortcomings on his part (he spent some time at Oxford, apparently), but is a deliberate gambit aimed at broadening his audience and hence maximizing the sales of his books.  That's fine, I suppose, but I finished the book with a feeling that the writing was uninspired and calculatedly middlebrow.  Consequently, overall Pearson's work suffers by comparison to such gifted contemporary mystery writers as Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane.<br />The story itself in this book is quite gripping, as it deals with issues surrounding the sabotage of airliners and the security apparatus designed to prevent such acts of terror.  What I did not care for was Pearson's creation of villains whose terrorism is carried out in the name of the &quot;green&quot; cause.  Whether this is intended or not, Pearson succeeds in making &quot;radical environmentalists&quot; appear dangerous and looney, a theme that plays right into the hands of contemporary politicians who would love nothing more than to have environmentalism generally discredited.	2001-06-06
US	52841075	R1Z7SDS8XKJMW9	0316154075	347427189	A Darkness More Than Night	Books	4	86	96	N	Y	Another great Connelly thriller, but . . .	Michael Connelly is the BEST mystery-thriller writer working today, so it almost goes without saying that this book stands head and shoulders above most others within this overcrowded genre.  In *A Darkness More Than Night*, he demonstrates once again his extraordinary skills in terms of weaving intricate plots filled with twists, turns, and early-innocuous-clues-that-become-pivotal-later-on.  He also has developed not just one but two extraordinary protagonists, Harry Bosch and Terrance McCaleb, and their &quot;face-off&quot; in this book adds a fascinating dimension to an already fine work. Connelly also does a wonderful job of creating the *noir*, &quot;there is evil afoot in this world&quot; mood/philosophy that pervades his books.  The discussions of Hieronymus Bosch's paintings, the symbolic meanings of owls, etc., are absolutely riveting.  <br />Given that I've bestowed such effusive praise upon this novel, why four stars instead of five?  First, it's apparent that the novel will be appreciated far more by readers who have already read not just one or two but ALL of Connelly's previous works.  Yes, it's common for mystery writers to write their successive books with an element of &quot;ongoing story&quot; to the work, including occasional references to events and cases described previously.  But Connelly employs this practice so heavily in this book that it almost seems futile for any reader to pick up *A Darkness More Than Night* without having gone through at least a few previous Connelly mysteries.  <br />The second reservation I had is one that other reviewers have mentioned, i.e., that although the McCaleb vs. Bosch angle is certainly exciting for all of us who are Connelly devotees, there is a certain implausibility about some aspects of the plot line, particularly in light of McCaleb's own travails in *Blood Work*.  Since one gets a clear inkling of where the story is headed, this removes some of the tension associated with how the Gunn case will ultimately be resolved.<br />Am I being nitpickingly negative here?  Perhaps.  For a writer as skilled as Michael Connelly, we readers develop extremely high expectations--perhaps excessively high.  Overall, this is a wonderful novel that leaves me waiting impatiently for Connelly's next work.	2001-05-28
US	52841075	R1G3PP7OIZE6ME	0671040596	666522577	Deviant Ways	Books	3	2	3	N	Y	There can be too much of a good thing	First-time novelist Chris Mooney apparently approached this book with a philosophy that &quot;more is better&quot; when it comes to all sorts of story elements: psychopathology, inner torment, blood and gore, big booming bomb blasts, and the heart-of-darkness-that-lurks-at-the-human-core.  Clearly, some people have an insatiable appetite for all of these titillating subjects, and hence the book is a smash hit headed perhaps for the Silver Screen.<br />Respectfully, I dissent.  Although certainly *Deviant Ways* constitutes an engrossing read and is hard to put down once started, I finished the book with a definite feeling that Mooney's yeoman effort here has lost its way by going way over the top--whenever in doubt, he substitutes blood, gore, terror, torment, and the endless spectre of Evil for actual literary craftsmanship.  The Evil Villain(s), the &quot;Sandman&quot; and Miles Hamilton, are almost laughably omniscient--they do things that are so inhumanly devious and technically sophisticated that one imagines that they must sport gigantic &quot;S's&quot; (for Satan and/or Superman) tattooed on their reprehensible chests.  After a while, for me the endless technological resourcefulness of the Sandman becomes predictable and tiresome.  And then there is the dark-but-on-the-side-of-good Mystery Man, Malcolm Fletcher, with his dark, haunting eyes and his own varieties of superhuman talents.  The Government (FBI), of course, is predictably duplicitous and nasty, and our hero, Jack Casey, is traumatized and tormented but determined to achieve ultimate justice.<br />In light of the willingness of our Sandman to slash, shoot, and blast just about anyone he chooses, his quirky willingness to let Jack Casey live to fight another day, time after time, seems inexplicable.  Why is Casey so special as to deserve this treatment?  It reminds me of the ongoing gag in Mike Myers' &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movies when Dr. Evil continually refuses simply to kill Powers, and when asked why he doesn't simply liquidate his foe, he says, &quot;You just don't get it, do you?&quot;  Yup, this device is simply TRANSPARENTLY necessary to keep the story going, and yet Mooney's treatment of these issues is not convincing enough to allow some of us, anyway, to engage in the suspension of disbelief that is  necessary in order to surrender to the flow of a far-fetched story.<br />Overall, Mooney has apparently decided that if people like evil villains, he'll give 'em ones who are simply the most evil ones EVER.  IF people like gore and blood and screaming, traumatized children, he'll give 'em pitiable children who have been completely broken psychologically.  If people like big explosions, he'll give 'em whole bunches.<br />In my view, there IS such a thing as too much action, too much psychopathology, and too much blood, gore, and torment, especially if these elements end up substituting for highly crafted storytelling and character development.  This is not a terrible book by any means, but it could have been a lot better.  After a while, to me this novel came to resemble a pulp-ish comic book more than the sophisticated novelistic thriller I had anticipated.	2001-05-28
US	52841075	RZULGZ48TCJBQ	0446602620	435728437	Blood Work	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Fabulously plotted until the very end	NO ONE crafts hard-boiled crime novels as masterfully as Michael Connelly.  Considering the hundreds of mystery writers out there toiling at this very moment over their word processors, that's quite an extravagant statement--but it's true all the same.  He has mastered the art of weaving mysteries that are superbly complex and which keep readers on the edge of their seats.  A seemingly unimportant utterance or action early in the novel can later on become magnified into an all-important clue as more is revealed about the crimes and the their perpetrator.  Connelly's ability to lead his readers in one direction only to have a sudden revelation change the entire complexion of the story is nothing short of breathtaking at times.  <br />*Blood Work* is a particularly fine mystery in terms of these kinds of &quot;twists and turns.&quot;  It's also refreshing to see Connelly take a vacation from the Harry Bosch series through his creation of a new protagonist, retired FBI man Terrell McCaleb.  Interestingly, McCaleb AND Harry Bosch are featured in a subsequent Connelly novel, *A Darkness More Than Night*.<br />Is the book perfect?  It's close, but no.  The ending is somewhat Hollywood theatrical, almost as though Connelly grew tired of brainstorming further subtleties and unexpected revelations.  Also, although Connelly is very attentive to empirical details in his descriptions of places and institutions, he slips up in chapter ten when he describes a character's employment as an engineer in charge of inspecting an aqueduct with a &quot;Lone Pine segment.&quot;  He writes, &quot;He was an engineer with a private firm contracted by the state...&quot; The Los Angeles Aqueduct is, of course, operated and maintained by the City of Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power.  This is a trivial error, of course, but those who know California water resources cannot help but raise their eyebrows upon reading this passage.	2001-05-21
US	52841075	R1KW8YW76D6N3A	0670891770	746289941	A Friend of the Earth	Books	5	5	8	N	N	A saga of eco-catastrophe that sadly, rings true	For those concerned over global warming, ozone depletion, mass extinction, endocrine disruption, worldwide pandemics, and on and on, this saga of imminent ecocatastrophe will prove irresistible but hardly comforting.  No, the vision of the not-so-distant future presented here by T. Coraghessan Boyle is dark, indeed, and yet it seems plausible enough in its broad outlines to ring true (though surely its trajectory of future events is compressed a bit).<br />Employing  novelistic techniques reminscent of Kurt Vonnegut (in fact, the overall tone and philosophy resemble Vonnegut) Boyle jumps back and forth through time in telling the story of Tyrone O'Shaughnessey Tierwater, eco-warrior extraordinaire.  Along with his wife Andrea and ultimately his daughter Sierra, Tierwater fights to save the Earth through &quot;direct action,&quot; i.e., &quot;monkeywrenching&quot; acts of sabotage against lumber companies, electrical utilities, and other promulgators of environmental destruction.  In weaving his tale, Boyle focuses much of his narrative upon the justifications and consequences of such acts of property destruction, including the all-important issue of whether, in fact, they accomplish the goals that motivate them.<br />Some readers might despair of Boyle's self-evidently cynical view of humanity and its prospects.  May I offer, however, that cynicism and idealism are usually two sides of the same attitudinal coin.  Boyle wrote the story, I suspect, at least in part out of hope that his portrayal of an apocalyptic future might motivate some people to work to prevent this eventuality from occurring.<br />Overall, I found the book impressively well written, thought-provoking, and a terrific read.  The one nagging point that bothered me, however, was Boyle's apparent unwillingness to explore critically his assertion that in order to be a friend of the earth one must be \\"an enemy of the people.\\"  Certainly many environmentalists sooner or later exhibit a bitterly misanthropic world-view, but anyone who has followed the ongoing protests against the World Trade Organization should see that many militants maintain that the global corporate forces that  pillage the earth's ecosystems are the same ones that oppress millions of human beings currently sentenced to impoverished, marginal lives.  The enemy is not necessarily \\"people,\\" but a governing set of political economic structures that render short-term corporate profitability the highest priority in all global investment decisions, and hence almost all corresponding political decisions.  I'm not one to force a political perspective upon Boyle, but he might have at least included more debate among his characters regarding this very important philosophical point.<br />In closing, I will compliment Boyle on his overall accurate presentation of geographical and scientific facts.  However, as a geographer, I must correct one error he commits, which is to place the &quot;state prison at Calpatria&quot; [sic] in the &quot;Mohave Desert,&quot; when actually, Calipatria is located in the Salton basin, part of the Colorado Desert.	2001-04-21
US	52841075	R2A3896OL43IU9	1582380910	942304799	Birds of North America: A Guide to Field Identification (A Golden Guide from St. Martin's Press)	Books	4	118	119	N	Y	A classic updated, but on the cheap	The Golden field guide, *Birds of North America* has been a favorite companion for countless birders since it was first published in the late 1960's.  It has the virtues of being nationally comprehensive, easy to follow (illustrations, maps, songs, and descriptions are provided on the same two pages), and perhaps best of all, small enough to carry in a jacket pocket. It also uses an interesting and highly useful visual &quot;sonagram&quot; approach to conveying information about bird vocalizations.<br />Unfortunately, however, the ornithological powers that be are constantly lumping and splitting species, rendering field guides at least somewhat obsolete overnight.  Consequently, these books must be updated periodically so as to be optimally useful to birders.  The Golden guide was last updated during the 1980s, and was long overdue for a makeover.  <br />Happily, this has finally been provided.  And indeed, this revised version of the guide is (for the moment) up to date regarding the various lumps and splits that have gone into effect over the past decade.  Some of the &quot;splits&quot; are fully illustrated, as with the Canyon vs. California (formerly Brown) towhee.  Some, however, are only mentioned in the text, and sometimes all too briefly.  It's probably ok not to have a separate illustration of the smaller Gunnison species of the Sage grouse, but a separate illustration of the California gnatcatcher surely should have been provided.  Similarly, the somewhat larger and brighter Island scrub jay should have been depicted separately from its relatives the scrub and Florida jays.  <br />Certainly, the publishers of this revised version of the Golden guide have made an earnest effort to provide an updated and attractive entry into the increasingly crowded birding field guide competition.  They have included, for example, some new plates illustrating the various introduced parrot species and some (surely not all) of the Eurasian vagrants that are reported in Alaska and along the west coast.  There also is a fine illustration comparing the tail feather patterns of both common and accidental pipit species.  <br />However, it seems apparent that the update to this guide was done on a fairly tight budget.  Most disappointing is the sometimes mediocre reproduction of what otherwise are fine color illustration plates.  Particularly in the shorebird, gull, and tern sections, the quality is simply not first-rate.  Apparently sloppy reproduction work also can lead to some misleading visual information.  For example, based upon the illustrations of the loon species, one might conclude that the summer Pacific loon has a greenish throat patch while that of the Arctic loon is purplish.  <br />Still, overall, I have always liked this field guide simply because it is so very easy to carry and to use.  Consequently, whereas other larger, heavier volumes may be what I study while preparing for a day in the field, the Golden guide provides me with the quick reference I might need while out in the field.  As a handy pocket reference, I would continue to recommend that birders consider purchasing this field guide in its updated version.	2001-04-17

This is what Patricia Cornwell offers, so I picked up *Cause of Death* and read it during a recent vacation trip (fortunately for me, I was able to check it out from the library).  <br />After finishing the book, I figure the author needs to change her name to &quot;Patricia Cornball.&quot;  Aside from the sometimes interesting material on forensic pathology, this is thin fare, folks.  What starts out as a reasonably intriguing mystery spins out of control over the final hundred pages into a ridiculous, soap operatic, thwarted made-for-tv movie script.  The ending is one of the worst I have encountered in decades of reading fiction.  <br />Aside from Marino, the characters overall are uninteresting (Scarpetta's niece Lucy is just plain horrible); the &quot;romantic interest&quot; is annoying and unconvincing; and the &quot;factual content&quot; aside from pathology (about which I know nothing so I cannot be sufficiently critical) is sloppy.  For example, in asking for a Nikon camera, protagonist Kay Scarpetta asks for the one &quot;with the single-reflex lens.&quot;  Say, what?  We're also informed that exposure to uranium is not harmful (tell that to the hundreds of former uranium miners who have developed cancer).  <br />Overall, this is a book that only diehard fans of Ms. Cornwell will enjoy.	2001-04-16
US	52841075	R30K9RBFEFQXCG	0786889306	974363020	Cimarron Rose (Billy Bob Holland)	Books	4	32	33	N	N	Distinctively Burke, for better or worse	Having read several of James Lee Burke's novels now, I have come to see that his approach to weaving together a story is intriguingly unorthodox.  His narrative is choppy and at times almost disjointed; short vignettes, encounters, and episodes are cobbled together, and change-of-voice digressions and flashbacks are not unusual.  Readers accustomed to a smoother ride will find Burke's approach difficult in places.<br />At the same time, Burke can positively hypnotize readers through the beauty of the language he employs and his ability to capture a thought, a moment, a mood, or a concept in a few well-chosen words or phrases.  This combination of organizational looseness and powerful, evocative writing makes reading Burke a truly distinctive literary experience.<br />In *Cimarron Rose*, Burke has taken a break from his Dave Robacheaux series and has introduced a new protagonist, Billy Bob Holland in a new setting, Deaf Smith County, Texas.  Still, the overall tone and style of the story will be familiar to readers of previous Burke novels.  Holland is another fallen lawman-type haunted by his past, and his similarity to Robacheaux in terms of his patterns of action and thinking are hardly surprising.  The story itself is populated by desperate criminal types, fallen women, drunkards, corrupt &quot;leading citizens,&quot; a demented maniac, and in fact, a entire cast of typical denizens of Burke's stories.  <br />With its loosely woven whodunit plot line and its accompanying quota of broken noses and gunshot wounds, the story is a kind of classic combination of police mystery and violent pulp fiction novella.  Added to this are some interesting added elements, including recurring reference to Billy Bob's great-grandaddy's journal and the regular appearance of the ghost of Billy Bob's ex-best friend and partner.  Combined with a rather weird ... ending, the whole mish-mash makes for interesting reading but doesn't constitute a satisfactorily well-woven novel overall.<br />Despite its flaws, *Cimarron Rose* is worthwhile not only because of Burke's talents as a wordsmith, but also because of his astute eye for social and class interactions and conflict in his small-town southern setting.  His descriptions of the myriad ways in which the affluent &quot;East enders&quot; dominate the small Texas community in which events unfold in this book shows Burke's keen understanding of the sociological and economic as well as psychological aspects of his human subject matter.  Clearly, his own sympathies are with the lower classes, the downtrodden, the underprivileged, and the way he skewers the powerful and hypocritical in this book is impressive, indeed.	2001-04-02
US	52841075	R2HEPO7UQYRN7D	0062730282	609092523	All the Birds of North America : American Bird Conservancy's Field Guide	Books	4	22	23	N	N	A worthy second bird guide to take into the field	With so many birding field guides available these days, birders suffer from a veritable embarrassment of riches when it comes to selecting which volume(s) to take into the field.  Even in the face of still competition, this still fairly new guide put together by the American Bird Conservancy has many strong points to recommend it.  First, the illustrations are, for the most part, gorgeously painted and well-printed.  Second, there is adequate emphasis on key identification field marks.  Third, the book is small enough to be easily carried in a jacket pocket or field guide pouch.  And fourth, although no single field guide can really be said to include &quot;all the birds,&quot; this one comes close enough, and even features some special sections and illustration plates showing &quot;accidentals&quot; that occasionally show up in North America.<br />If there is a key problem for potential users of this guide, it is that its authors have daringly attempted to create a new way to organize the presentation of the many hundreds of species included.  Rather than follow the taxonomic approach typical of other field guides, the authors have organized in part in accordance with habitat and geographical area.  For novice birders unfamiliar with the way it's &quot;usually done,&quot; this may prove quite convenient.  For experienced birders, however, this distinctive organization will likely prove the source of headaches rather than added convenience.<br />The other problem with this and indeed, any field guide that is more than a year or so old is that ornithologists are constantly lumping and splitting species.  With its 1997 publication date, the book is recent enough to have included some important &quot;splits,&quot; including the California/Black-tailed gnatcatchers and the California/Canyon towhees.  However, there are more recent changes that have occurred since 1997, including the newly recognized Gunnison sage grouse and the splitting off of Arizona from Strickland'swoodpecker.  Hopefully, the publishers of *All The Birds* will employ a periodic updating regimen to keep its readers current with regard to what is or is not considered a &quot;real species.&quot;<br />Ultimately, the field guide that most avid birders will continue to carry with them in the field always is the *National Geographic Field Guide To The Birds of North America*.  As a second and perhaps more portable reference, however, *All The Birds of North America* might be a good book to bring on one's field trips, as well.	2001-04-02

However, it's sufficiently flawed and uneven that it leads me toward recommending that people bypass this book in favor of others that are more worthy of attention.  <br />The protagonist Dr. Kay Scarpetta is interesting enough and the insights into the work of a forensic pathologist are morbidly intriguing (yes, I used to watch &quot;Quincy&quot; on TV, too).  But what makes or breaks a mystery novel is the way that the plot is structured and the characters relate to one another.  In a first-rate mystery, there are slight *possible* clues offered early on that later turn out to be pivotal to how the case is resolved.  Here, however, Cornwell commits one of the cardinal sins of mystery writing: she creates a virtually unrelated character as the primary villain, one who isn't even introduced until halfway through the book. This results in an almost deus-ex-machina feel to the resolution of the crime(s).  She also presents an unbelievably hokey identity twist that serves to bring some rather banally presented romantic interest into the story.  <br />I can say no more here, lest I act as a &quot;spoiler,&quot; boo, hiss.  Let me add, however, that her descriptions of places are not a strong point.  Having spent time in Key West, I didn't particularly feel that the island &quot;came alive&quot; through her depiction of it.<br />Overall, this book seems to reveal a still inexperienced writer who simply is still feeling her way along within the difficult but also overcrowded mystery genre.  I am hopeful that some of Cornwall's later books are more sophisticated and well thought-out in terms of their structure; this one is simply not a first-rate work.  <br />For people looking for really well-done mysteries, I would recommend the work of the following authors: Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, Harlan Coben (usually good, but not always), and Sue Grafton. I'm sure there are many, MANY more, but I hardly would claim to have digested them all.	2001-03-27

The story is loosely woven to the point of being chaotic--Dave Robicheaux skitters here, there, and everywhere, including TWO almost gratuitous mini-jaunts to Mexico.  The characters are &quot;colorful,&quot; but in some cases, such as that of Aaron Crown, the eccentricity deteriorates into cartoon-like caricature. There are various smalltime gangsters who are hard to keep straight, there is a politician's wife who turns up periodically to strip off her clothes, taunt Robicheaux sexually, and then disappear in a cloud of vituperative hissing.  And there are more than a few digressions and sidebars to the story that don't ever seem quite justified--it's all a bit much, methinks, and overall it makes for a story that never really hangs together adequately.  <br />Still, Burke is a good enough writer that it's a hard book to put down once started.  I think he has done better in others of his mysteries, however.	2001-03-10
US	52841075	R17XMEGU9K7DNZ	0688163165	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	2	4	N	N	One of the best crime novels ever written	Dennis Lehane wisely elected to take a break from his Kenzie-Gennaro mystery series, and gambled on a new and different venture, a more broadly drawn novel of crime, consequence, and human frailty and folly.  The results are staggeringly successful, as *Mystic River* is nothing short of a masterpiece within the crime novel genre.<br />In terms of the mystery story line, I suppose some readers can rightfully find fault with the book, including its ending.  It is neither the most intricate nor the most surprise-filled tale of its type.  What's amazing about *Mystic River*, however, is that in some ways the &quot;mystery story&quot; actually is less riveting and significant than is the overall collage of characters, times, and places.  This is not just a &quot;mystery novel&quot; but a &quot;novel,&quot; period, one that engages the reader from page one and never lets go until the last line on page four hundred.<br />Lehane has a knack for capturing in a few well-chosen words and phrases what people are feeling and thinking, what makes them tick, what drives them for good or (in his stories, mostly) for evil.  The man can flat-out write, and with each new novel his skills move to yet another level.<br />The one &quot;yeah, but&quot; that emerged for me as I read *Mystic River* was of the political/philosophical type.  Clearly, the world as portrayed by Dennis Lehane is a twisted, dark, and unhappy place.  With the exception of his troubled-but-doing-the-right-thing protagonists, the characters that animate his vision of human existence tend toward the haunted and desperate, and the overall mood and message of *noir* sticks with you long after you've finished his books.  Are people really as tragically scarred and warped as Lehane tells us?  Are we to take this dark vision of human life to heart and allow it to shape (and limit) our philosophies, actions, and notions of what is possible for our lives and the lives of those around us?  I like to think that this cynical world-view is *meant* to be partial, that it leads us into a dark and frightening but unabashedly *fictional* world that is not intended to be a literal mirror of the real world--in other words, it's art, but it's also show biz, and we as readers should not mistake its message, however spellbinding, for any overly serious declaration about the totality of the &quot;human condition.&quot;  When we enter Lehane's universe, we are invited, even forced to suspend to some degree our critical everyday notions about human nature, social progress, and the human capacity for noble as well as terrible deeds.  It's like looking at the world as the distorted reflection of a carnival side-show mirror--what we see is indeed a reflection of things that are real, but the image is hardly meant to be accurate and photographic.<br />On the other hand, however, once a reader has considered human existence as it is portrayed by a wordmaster like Lehane, it's hard not to allow his insights and visions to affect daily thoughts about &quot;life&quot; and &quot;people.&quot;  His writing is immensely powerful, and it stays with you long after you've moved on to other authors, books, and literary genres.al world-view is *meant* to be partial, that it leads us into a dark and frightening but unabashedly *fictional* world that is not intended to be a literal mirror of the real world--in other words, it's art, but it's also show biz, and we as readers should not mistake its message, however spellbinding, for any overly serious declaration about the totality of the &quot;human condition.&quot;  When we enter Lehane's universe, we are invited, even forced to suspend to some degree our critical everyday notions about human nature, social progress, and the human capacity for noble as well as terrible deeds.

US	52841075	R11NFFVYBGGGAG	0380730367	240949428	Prayers for Rain (Patrick Kenzie/Angela Gennaro Novels)	Books	4	10	13	N	N	Good, but perhaps it's time for a break from the series	Dennis Lehane has created one of the very best hard boiled-and-hip private investigator series in contemporary literature, the Boston-set adventures of Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, plus their brutal-but-lovable sidekick, Bubba.  All of the books in the series have been exemplary, and in most ways, *Prayers for Rain* is no exception.  The plot is gripping, the villain is reprehensible, and there are enough twists in the story to keep readers fascinated right up until the slightly ambiguous and discordant ending.  <br />So for those who have followed the series from its beginnings with *A Drink Before the War* (and reading the books in order is definitely the way to go here), I would certainly recommend that they read this book, as surely they will enjoy it.<br />HOWEVER--I did develop some reservations this time around.  There were three aspects of *A Prayer for Rain* that I found annoying.  First, Lehane gives every impression here of having visions that, like Robert Parker's Spenser, Kenzie and Gennaro might someday grace their very own television series.  There is certainly nothing wrong with this, but the increasingly macho behavior of Kenzie, including in-you-face posturing in face-to-face encounters with his villains seems just a tad too similar to scenes from &quot;Nash Bridges.&quot;  I suspect that he would have gone ahead and called his adversary &quot;Bubba,&quot; were it not for the fact that one of the main characters in the novels already has claimed this name.  <br />And Bubba--ah, yes.  He's an interesting and in some ways lovable kind of sidekick character, but when he is brought front and center in the story, as he has this time around, the ridiculous nature of his *persona* becomes uncomfortably clear.  As another reviewer commented, he is a veritable cartoon character, a person who is real life would really be a kind of psychopathic monster.  Yet here he is portrayed not only as a kind of super-male &quot;warrior&quot;-hero, but a kind of warm-and-fuzzy one who engages in completely unlikely romantic conquests (I won't give away the details here), a feature which I would think many women readers would find kind of offensive. <br />The third flaw is a kind of minor thing, but it annoyed me just the same.  Lehane clearly has a strongly male persective in his approach to relationships and to women in general, and this becomes a limitation on the effectiveness of his writing sometimes.  For example, his idealized female protagonist, Angela, comes across as a fairly shallow character much of the time, and on occasion Lehane puts words and sentiments in her mouth which are pretty ridiculous.  For example, Angie postulates that Bubba's magnetism with regard to even the most cool and intellectual of women is attributed in part to the fact that he is &quot;hung,&quot; a fact that women allegedly can always tell, no matter what a man is wearing.  Give me a break, folks.<br />I know, picky, picky.  Overall, this novel stands head and shoulders above most others in this genre, and fans of the previous books certainly should go ahead and read it.  But I think that there is a tiredness to the Kenzie-Gennaro series by this point, and I suspect that Lehane himself agreed, since his newest book, *Mystic River*, has a different set of characters.	2001-02-19
US	52841075	R2FTSM2BEJDMLJ	0380730359	165181769	Gone, Baby, Gone: A Novel	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Grisly and depressing, but superbly crafted	With each successive work in his Kenzie/Gennaro private investigator series, Dennis Lehane has shown increasing maturity, depth, and complexity in his writing.  The plots have become more unpredictable in their various twists and turns, and his treatment of socially relevant subject matter has become more insightful.  Given that its subject is crimes against children, *Gone, Baby, Gone* is a highly disturbing and depressing work, but one that is sufficiently well-presented to be rewarding for readers.<br />The best mysteries include surprises in the plot, hidden clues that lead to later revelations that transform the entire nature of the crime under scrutiny and point toward suspects that heretofore were considered above reproach.  Lehane has crafted just such a story here, and in doing so has created a book that in many ways resembles the work of Michael Connelly, perhaps the very best writer in the contemporary &quot;hip private eye&quot; genre.<br />Whereas in *Sacred*, Lehane provided few new insights into his male and female protagonists, in this book, Patrick and Angela are shaken to their very emotional foundations by the nature of the crimes they are investigating, and this leads the reader ever-deeper into their respective psyches.  It must be said, however, that Lehane's ability to probe Kenzie's thoughts and reflections is far superior to what he demonstrates with respect to Angela.  I must say, in fact, that besides being &quot;gorgeous&quot; and a great sharpshooter, Gennaro is not really presented as a particularly appealing or interesting character, at least in my view.  Maybe it's her chain-smoking that alienates me.<br />Finally: the extremely dark, almost nihilistic view of human life presented by Lehane can be depressing, but readers should keep in mind that this element of *noir* is part and parcel of this venerable literary genre.  In other words, it makes for a great read and some valuable insights into the dark recesses of the human soul, butit's best not taken TOO very seriously.	2001-02-13
US	52841075	R1MF6TGIJLDLTB	0380726297	516722500	Sacred	Books	5	22	23	N	Y	Not perfect, but close	This is the third in Dennis Lehane's series of Boston-based, hard boiled-but-hip private eye novels featuring the team of Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. This time, he refreshes his formula by taking his characters to a new locale, the Tampa-St.Petersburg area in Florida. What remains constant, however, is that Lehane has crafted another action-packed mystery thriller that once started is hard to put down.<br />In each successive book, Lehane has further developed his ability to create plot lines that feature the twists, turns, and surprises that characterize only the very best action/mystery novels.  In *Sacred*, he keeps the reader guessing right up until very close to the end of the book, and for this reason alone, the novel can be highly recommended.<br />But Lehane does not just tell a good story, he writes exceedingly well and has a gift for describing characters,  places, and human emotions that is rare within the detective genre.  And to add frosting to the cake, in this novel he includes, almost in passing, some apt critical social commentary regarding the rapaciousness of the current &quot;globalization&quot; trend within the corporate world and Americans' overall obliviousness to the dark underside of this ongoing phenomenon.  <br />Is the book perfect?  No, there are some minor shortcomings, in my opinion.  The ending is a bit on the theatrical side (perhaps the book might someday become a Hollywood film?) and I confess that I found the turn toward deep romantic engagement between Patrick and Angela more boring than gratifying.  In terms of further developing the nuances of his main characters, Lehane has essentially taken a vacation in *Sacred*.  Maybe next time.<br />Let me add that I was surprised to see that there is apparently an ongoing misconception among readers of this book that Lehane made a &quot;glaring error&quot; by including a clue involving the title of a 1965 Bob Dylan composition, &quot;Positively Fourth Street.&quot;  In fact, Lehane made no such error.  On page 174, the clue offered by detective Jay Becker was, &quot;Bob Dylan in St. Pete. . . Songs, not albums.&quot;  Yup, &quot;Positively Fourth Street&quot; was indeed a well-known Bob Dylan song, so what's the problem?  <br />Overall, *Sacred* is a darned good read, a page-turner that stands head and shoulders above most other books in its genre.  Consequently, I'm looking forward to moving on to the next volume in the Kenzie/Gennaro saga, &quot;Gone, Baby Gone.&quot;	2001-02-04
US	52841075	RYCJS1DLF6AJC	0380726289	380093282	Darkness, Take My Hand: A Novel (Patrick Kenzie/Angela Gennaro Novels)	Books	5	132	141	N	N	Excellent and gripping, but not for the faint of heart	There are soooo many mystery writers out there these days, but there is only a handful who truly produce first-rate work on a consistent basis.  Dennis Lehane is definitely a member of this elite, and *Darkness, Take My Hand* demonstrates why.  <br />Like Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, and some others in the P.I./lone wolf cop genre, Lehane has written his books in such a way that they are best read &quot;in order,&quot; as each book builds on the previous one(s) in terms of the development of his main characters.  Consequently, readers should read Lehane's first book, *A Drink Before the War*, before picking up *Darkness, Take My Hand*, which is the second in the series.  <br />In most respects, however, *Darkness* is a richer, deeper, and better-crafted mystery than was Lehane's debut novel.  He has utilized a well-worn but still effective plot theme here, that of the long-term serial killer.  This provides the basis for the mystery element of the book, and also, perhaps unfortunately, the blood-and-guts angle, as well.  Yes, there is a lot of gore in this book, and lots of discussion in graphic detail of the depravities of which human beings are capable.  Lehane's work is NOT for the faint of heart.  <br />What separates Lehane from many other mystery writers, even good ones like Robert Parker, is his sheer literary talent.  His writing is gloriously rich, descriptive (particularly in terms of his depictions of the Boston area setting for his stories), and insightful, and he goes to great pains to develop in some psychological depth his main characters, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro.  Consequently, this enables Lehane to take his work well beyond the cliches that are so typical of shamus novels.  <br />If you like the work of Parker, Connelly, Crais, Barre, Burke, etc., you should definitely start reading Lehane--in order, of course.	2001-01-20
US	52841075	R2R9APDFBPYYHF	0553286447	287368783	Stalking the Angel (Elvis Cole, Book 2)	Books	3	20	25	N	N	Great character, great writing, mediocre story	Robert Crais has created an appealing and humorous protagonist for his Los Angeles-set crime novels in private investigator Elvis Cole.  Cole is a fascinating combination of post-Viet Nam hardboiled cynicism and golden-hearted idealism, a wisecracking, Corvette-driving master of martial arts who is also a first-rate detective.  Crais makes Cole's adventures all the more appealing through his lively and witty writing style; his stories are carried along by his colorful descriptions of places and people, and he punctuates his narrative with clever verbal &quot;zingers&quot; through which Crais demonstrates considerable insight into human beings and their foibles. <br />In this, the second of the Elvis Cole novels, Crais focuses upon a crime scenario involving the *yakuza*, the so-called &quot;Japanese Mafia.&quot;  The first part of the book sets out the elements of a potentially intricate mystery involving the stealing of a precious Japanese sacred text; this leads to murder, kidnapping, and a fascinating foray into the Japanese-American underworld by Cole and his gun-toting associate, Joe Pike.<br />The promise that is presented by the first part of the book, however, goes largely unrealized in the second.  The &quot;mystery&quot; proves to be fairly easily solved, and the last portion of the story mainly involve a lot of chasing, fighting, and ultimately shooting of stereotyped Asian bad guys by Cole and Pike.  Cole actually has a heart of gold (of course), and ends up doing much of his crime-solving work for free, because it is the &quot;right thing to do.&quot;  To a point, this is reasonable as part of the author's strategy for creating a hero appropriate to the genre.  However, by the end of the book, the highly risky course of action followed by our heroes simply out of the goodness of their hearts seems way too implausible, and their methods for righting wrongs way too violent.  The story actually impressed me as akin to something one might see in a private eye television series, i.e., light on intricacy of plot, heavy on &quot;fightin' and shootin',&quot; and with a highly simplistic differentiation between the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad&quot; characters.<br />Crais is an indisputably skillful writer who can turn a phrase as well as any of the best crime story writers around today.  However, *Stalking The Angel* is lightweight fare when compared to the deeper, more substantial work of say, Michael Connelly.  Having now read Crais' first two Cole novels, I am curious to read one or more of his more recent works. I want to see whether as Crais has developed his mystery writing acumen he has shown himself capable of developing books in which the appeal to readers is based not just upon private eye wisecracks, alluring locales, and a socko series of action-packed sequences, but also upon a more highly-crafted plot structure.	2001-01-07
US	52841075	R2ATGKNR026SRX	0553275852	814945983	The Monkey's Raincoat  (Elvis Cole)	Books	4	38	41	N	N	A fun read, but NOT a great mystery	Having read all of the terrific Michael Connelly police detective mysteries, I was alerted to Robert Crais' Elvis Cole books as another fine hard-boiled Los Angeles-based mystery series.  I was advised to read them in order, so I began at the beginning with *The Monkey's Raincoat*.  Overall, this book was well worth reading, but I must conclude that at least in this first effort, Crais has produced more of an &quot;action thriller&quot; than a true mystery.<br />The tough, wise-cracking Viet Nam veteran Cole is an appealing protagonist, and the quirkiness of his survivalist sidekick Joe Pike adds a bizarre and colorful element to the story.  Crais is an excellent writer with an eye for the ironies of contemporary American life and a wry sense of humor, and these skills enrich the book immeasurably.  Make no mistake about it, this is a can't-put-it-down read that stands head and shoulders about the typical work of private eye pulp fiction.<br />I was disappointed, however, in the simplicity of the plot itself.  There really was precious little &quot;mystery&quot; at all in the story, and very few of the surprises-one-might-have-foreseen-from-a-tiny-clue-early-on that one comes to expect from a first-rate practioner of the genre such as Michael Connelly.  Where a true mystery offers such unexpected twists and turns, Crais offers a surfeit of blood, guts, and mayhem.  Elvis Cole is forever getting himself into difficult situations from which he can extricate himself only through popping someone in the nose, spraying blood everywhere (of course), or by shooting a whole bunch of bad guys.  The body count in this book is alarmingly high, to tell the truth.  <br />I would add that although I realize that the sudden plunge into bed by the hero and whatever attractive woman happens to be handy is a standard part of the private eye genre, Crais' handling of this aspect of the novel is nothing special.  <br />Overall, this is a lively read that shows Crais to be above averagein his literary skills (certainly on a par with Robert Parker, whose work is highly uneven). This first effort, however, is simply not a fully satisfying *mystery*.  Still, I'm definitely going on to read his second book.	2000-12-29
US	52841075	RMJB89SDMOQL	0446607274	515249324	Angels Flight (Harry Bosch)	Books	5	98	108	N	N	They don't get much more &quot;noir&quot; than this one	Ever since I read Connelly's *The Black Echo*, the first of the Harry Bosch mysteries, I've been hooked on these wonderfully complex, fabulously written novels.  Bosch is (predictably) &quot;hard-boiled and melancholy, but with a heart of gold,&quot; as befits this venerable fictional genre.  Yes, there are many, MANY cop/P.I. detective series out there, but in my estimation, Connelly's Bosch series is the best, and *Angels Flight* shows why.<br />The theme in this novel is the atmosphere of racial distrust and recriminations against the Los Angeles police that has emerged in the wake of the Rodney King cases and the O.J. Simpson trial.  Connelly succeeds for the most part in capturing the tragic essence of what has been wrought by the legacy of police misconduct and the African American reaction to it in the city of angels.  <br />Not surprisingly, he is most effective in presenting the police perspective here: the outrage and frustration at the deterioration of police credibilty in the community overall; the combination of anger and grudging admiration that a get-the-police black attorney might elicit from conscientious police professionals; the increasing disillusionment as the politicization of police affairs becomes ever more complete.  <br />If there is a weakness in Connelly's adventuresome foray into political territory, it's related to the delicate and difficult race-related theme he has addressed here.  To succeed totally in this endeavor, Connelly must navigate through some extremely tricky sociological issues, and it becomes apparent that he might be in a bit over his head in this regard.  When attempting to provide the African American perspective on police presence and conduct in LA, for example, Connelly does a decent but not outstanding job.  Clearly, here he is an &quot;outsider.&quot;  <br />This flaw is forgiveable, of course, in light of the fact that his principal task is to provide an engrossing police mystery.  Here, he succeeds brilliantly, as always.  Along the way, he presents a picture of contemporary society that is dark, frightening, almost hopeless.  To say that this novel is &quot;noir&quot; is an understatement.  Connelly's portrayal of human nature, contemporary police and civil politics, and the ongoing deterioration of &quot;the California dream&quot; in the city of angels is stunningly powerful.  This is not a book that will appeal to the faint of heart.<br />As always, there is a thread in this novel that continues &quot;the story&quot; where it left off in his previous mystery in which Bosch was the protagonist.  Consequently, whereas this book certainly can provide a can't-put-it-down read for those who have never read any of the previous Bosch mysteries, these books are best appreciated if they are read in chronological order, beginning with *The Black Echo*.<br />Currently, I've been reading Dennis Lehane and Robert Crais mysteries.  These are terrific, but as I turn the pages I can't wait for the next Bosch novel to be released.	2000-12-22
US	52841075	R3ERJLV1OZRQIF	0312952813	152178043	The Black Ice (Harry Bosch)	Books	5	290	302	N	Y	Hard-boiled thriller, a great read	Michael Connelly's books are definitively within the &quot;hard-boiled urban detective&quot; genre that historically has been highlighted by the work of Raymond Chandler and other great mystery writers.  *The Black Ice* is the second in a series of novels with LAPD detective Hieronymous Bosch as the protagonist (the first was *The Black Echo*), and it's definitely a winner.  There's murder, intrigue, twists and turns in the plot, and plenty of action, as well.  <br />One thing that Connelly does particularly well is to include geographical/place descriptions in his work. When one reads his descriptions of life in Los Angeles or travels to a bordertown like Mexicali, these places really do seem real and are accurately depicted.  <br />The book is not perfect; as in so many police mysteries, sometimes the clues come just a bit too neatly packaged, and at times this doesn't seem realistic. But then, real police work is probably pretty dull 90% of the time (false leads, endless drudgery, etc.), so streamlining the process for the sake of fast-moving fiction is certainly forgiveable.  The other thing that had me rolling my eyes a bit is the obligatory &quot;romantic angle&quot; that seems always to be a subplot in these books.  Again, it's kind of a sacred part of the genre, but wouldn't it be interesting if for once Bosch noted the &quot;gorgeous but sad woman&quot; and then went about his business without becoming involved with her?  <br />All in all, this is a terrific book and an absorbing, &quot;can't put it down&quot; read.  One last thing: I would recommend that people who wish to read the Bosch novels start with the first (*The Black Echo*) and read them in chronological order, as Connelly is very careful in his novels about maintaining accurate references to what has happened to his protagonist previously.	2000-12-11
US	52841075	R3QHMNWZBKTQNF	0671003763	609762034	The Temple of My Familiar	Books	3	29	43	N	N	She ruins a potential gem by pandering to victimhood	Alice Walker is an incredibly talented writer, a gentle and spiritual soul, and in some of her works, a wonderful storyteller. *The Temple of My Familiar* is a different kind of novel, one with no real plot or progression, but instead an interwoven tapestry of characters, places, and relationships. Keeping the various personalities and their connections to one another straight can be a problem, but the reader who is conscientious in this regard will be rewarded with an overall novelic structure that represents a breathtaking panorama of human (mostly African and African American)life. <br />Along the way, Walker tells the story of the conquest and subjugation of black Africa by white Europe, showing how the cultures of Africa were brutally suppressed and all but destroyed by the imperialist white nations. It's a story that has now been told fairly frequently, but given the continuing misconceptions that most whites have regarding the alleged historical \\"backwardness\\" of Africa and Africans, it's a story that needs to be told over again and in different ways.<br />So far, so good. Where Walker loses her way, as far as I am concerned, is toward the end of the book where her characters begin to spin a highly speculative tale of how white Europe, with its patriarchal God, allegedly destroyed and then denied the very existence of the African \\"mother goddess,\\" the worship of which by Africans had been associated with peaceful, nature-loving, non-sexist, morally upright ways of life. Walker turns her book into a bully pulpit for many of the unsubstantiated (and unsubstantiatable) and in some cases outright silly claims of recent \\"feminist Afrocentric scholarship,\\" a revenge strategy for all people of African heritage that blames veritably all of the world's problems on the apparently inherent evil of white males. Her characters talk about the shortcomings of \\"whites\\" in ways that correspond eerily to the ways that racist whites have long stereotyped blacks. The book becomes a propaganda vehicle in support of the passive victimhood of blacks in general and of black women in particular. <br />My own point is not to deny the historical wrongs done to Africans and African Americans. Quite the contrary, in fact--I would suggest that the actual story of how the cultural aggressiveness and racism of white Europe (and America) devastated the African cultures and peoples is horrible enough on its own to not need this kind of questionable mythic embellishment. Walker's discussion of white Evil in some ways parallels the nonsense associated for decades with the Nation of Islam with its fairy tales about how the white race was created by the Big-headed Scientist, etc. In both cases, the result is to demonize human beings, in this case whites, for the sake of upholding the alleged \\"original\\" purity of other humans, in this case, Africans (mostly the women, of course). <br />The fact is that as fully human, intelligent, and complex beings, Africans have shown themselves to be completely capable of creating their own problems, hatreds, prejudices, and weaknesses. Certainly it is unfair and simplistic to blame ALL of Africa's (and African America's) problems on white oppression. Metaphorically speaking, the world is filled not just with blacks and white, but also shades of gray.<br />In her defense, Walker does indeed portray some white people in a favorable light, and presents perspectives other than the \\"African Mother Goddess Destroyed\\" fairy tale. But it is this point of view that seems to have been placed center stage in the work, and it is presented with no real reservations or counter-views. <br />Overall, I think that the book is an interesting read and Walker has much of interest to say, but her confusion of historical fact with Afrocentric mythology disappointed me.	2000-11-01

Richard Warren Field has taken the field ofcontemporary American electoral politics and woven an interesting,though not terribly well-written tale of a third party candidacy thatthrows the historically curious American Electoral College-basedelectoral system into a veritable tizzy.  In presenting thehypothetical eco-leftist candidacy of one Michael Edwards, Field usesthe novel as a pulpit for the presentation of some interestingprogressive ideas, while simultaneously bringing to light some of the(many) flaws within the current electoral system.  If he actually werea novelist instead of an earnest reformer trying to &quot;spread theword&quot; using a literary form that clearly is difficult for him,the book would be more of a success.  <br />In developing a&quot;page-turner&quot; about a hypothetical election, Field does hisbest to embellish his plot with suspense, skullduggery, and even onoccasion, sex.  Once the halfway point in the novel is reached, thingsbegin to move along quickly and entertainingly, and indeed, the bookin its final stages is hard to put down.  I also compliment Field forusing the novel as a kind of educational device regarding theElectoral College system and some other strange and often-arcaneaspects of the American approach to Presidential elections.  Finally,some of the ideas his upstart candidate preaches in his campaign arenoble and interesting, particularly those regarding the desirabilityof moving our society in a more ecologically responsible direction.In light of the current threats posed by global warming and (again)soaring energy prices, the need for a renewed commitment to renewableenergy and a less materially gluttonous lifestyle has never been moreapparent.  <br />As a novel, however, *The Election* is not entirelysuccessful.  First of all, the characters are oppressively shallow andwooden, and the narration lacks any real litarary nuance ordescriptive depth. The strength of the book is in its messages, notits style of presentation.  Second, in order to make his &quot;thirdparty that catches fire&quot; theme at all plausible, Field needed tocreate a scenario in which the ecofriendly message of Michael Edwardswould suddenly seem significant enough to cause people to abandon the&quot;lesser of two evils&quot; mindset that has kept the vastmajority of voters attached to the two-party system for decades.Americans certainly are supportive overall of environmentalprotection, but from all indications, ecological issues simply are notamong the most significant issues that influence people's votes.  Thatthey could become so is certainly possible, but it would require somekind of threat or crisis (and likely one that includes a body count),and Field does not present any such scenario that would move &quot;theenvironment&quot; to the top of people's electoralagenda....<br />Overall, I salute Mr. Field for his dedication topossible significant change through the electoral system, and Irecommend the book to anyone who has ever fantasized about an electionshocker that would bring an eco-friendly administration into power.The cynic in me finds his scenario insufficiently plausible, butcertainly Field's heart is in the right place.

In taking this iconoclastic perspective, occasionally he has committed memorable gaffes--for example, his suggestion years ago that Joe Montana and his wife should have foreseen that Jennifer's January due date for giving birth would be a distraction for Joe during the playoffs.  Such displays of poor judgment aside, however, Dickey remains a highly insightful and skillful writer whose column is practically always a good read.  <br />Aside from writing columns, Dickey has written fifteen books, including works on the Raiders and the 49ers.  *Glenn Dickey's 49ers* is an all-too-short but still highly valuable recent history of the Bay Area's most successful franchise, and I recommend it to all fans of the red and gold. <br />Over the years, Dickey has spent time one-on-one with many of the principal personalities involved with the &quot;rise, fall, and rebirth of the NFL's greatest dynasty,&quot; and consequently has had access to insights and information that make for fascinating reading in this book.  Although Dickey has a reputation for being harsh in his judgments and appraisal of people, he actually is careful here to present both the strengths and weaknesses of the &quot;heavies&quot; in 49ers history, including Walsh, DeBartolo, Policy, Seifert, etc.  Only that jerk of legendary proportions, Joe Thomas, is portrayed in an unrelentingly negative light.<br />On the basis of reading this book, fans will come to realize that Eddie Debartolo's ultimate self-destruction as an owner and as a person was almost inevitable from the start and, in fact, reflected the flip side of the very human qualities that made him such an endearing and generous team owner.  Dickey is also careful to point out that the recent downfall of the team was really inevitable, and should not be blamed on any particular decisions by anyone, including former team President Carmen Policy.  <br />Overall, then, Dickey presents a balanced and realistic view of the team's recent history, one that all fans of the franchise should enjoy.  The book is flawed, however, in being a bit on the brief side--by expanding somewhat on the book's 262 pages, Dickey could easily have presented more highlights and information about the team's past twenty years.  Perhaps more important, however, is his inexplicable inclusion of numerous silly factual errors, errors that careful editing or even proofreading should have caught and eliminated.  A previous reviewer has presented some of these mistakes.  Others include identifying Roger Craig as the Most Valuable Player of the Superbowl played in January 1985 (it was actually Joe Montana), and the misspelling of the name of 49er defensive lineman Kevin Fagan as &quot;Fagen.&quot;  He also misquotes Eddie DeBartolo's memorable exclamation at the news conference anouncing George Seifert's resignation and Steve Mariucci's hiring as head coach.   When asked about the fate of then offensive coordinator Marc Trestman, DeBartolo blurted out, &quot;He's gone!&quot;  Dickey writes that DeBartolo said, &quot;He's toast!&quot;  <br />These are small errors, to be sure, but cumulatively they leave the reader with an impression of carelessness that detracts from the overall impact of what otherwise is a fine book about the San Francisco 49ers.	2000-09-29
US	52841075	R16OTQKS62ERIP	0375503994	196227364	Shrub: The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush	Books	5	71	78	N	Y	Should be required reading for all voters	Political columnist Molly Ivins is well-known as a &quot;liberal  gadfly&quot; in Texas, and so it's hardly surprising that her political  biography of George W. Bush paints an unrelentingly unflattering picture of  Dubya.  However, in critiquing the accomplishments (or lack of same) of  George the Younger, Ivins writes with grace and wit, and without undue  rancor toward her political opponent.  She lets the facts speak for  themselves. The result is a highly readable, entertaining, and yet clearly  disturbing book.  How is it possible that someone so eminently unqualified  can be so close to becoming the next President of the United States?<br />The  story Ivins tells is one that is a damning indictment of the current U.S.  political system.  George W. Bush was hand-picked by monied corporate  interests some time ago to be groomed as a potential &quot;capitalist  tool,&quot; a figurehead politician who will do their bidding  unquestionably while possessing the personality traits essential to  appealing to a broad spectrum of voters.  It's the stuff out of which bad  Hollywood movies are made, and yet it's real.  Consequently, although there  is much wry humor in Ivins' narrative regarding how this ne'er-do-well,  pampered inheritor of the Bush political legacy, the story she weaves is  also frightening.  <br />What I found particularly disturbing was Bush's  indifference toward the natural environment. His lack of commitment to  protecting the health of Texans from pollution is incredible.  Given the  high level of support that Americans overall have expressed for strong  environmental laws, this issue alone ought to be sufficient to disqualify  Dubya from the presidency.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who  wishes to get beyond the network tv blather and the high-powered campaign  ads (from both sides, actually) in order to take a real look at what George  W. Bush actually has accomplished in his political life.  Even for those  who might share his conservative philosophy, his lack of real experience  and accomplishments ought to give them pause.  <br />Finally: it's interesting  that the principal criticism that offended Bush devotees have mustered  toward this book (and sometimes I question whether they actually read it  before expressing their hostility) is that after all, everyone KNOWS that  Ivins is a liberal whacko, etc., so what she writes has no real  credibility.  This demonstrates that when the facts are in order and cannot  be denied, the only viable avenue of attack is *ad hominem* verbiage  directed toward the author.  Scary!	2000-09-04

I was not  seeking Great Literature, but merely another lightweight archaeological  thriller appropriate for vacation reading. *Excavation* is indeed an  action-packed tale that occurs in an exotic locale, the Peruvian Andes; so  far, so good.  However, as I compulsively turned those pages, I ultimately  found myself more annoyed than entertained by Rollins' saga. <br />You see, I  believe there is such a thing as too much action and too outlandish a plot,  and this book represents a perfect example.  There are so many Indiana  Jones-esque booby-traps, heretofore unknown menacing creatures,  blood-curdling screams, and in-the-nick-of-time escapes that the whole  thing actually becomes laughable after a while. The last straw for me was  not so much the screaming naked ape-bear-cannibals nor the roving killer  mob of albino tarantulas. No, it was the inclusion of a gratuitous passage  in which a large bat gets tangled in the female protagonist's hair.  The  bat-in-the-hair bummer is possibly the oldest nature myth around, and yet  Rollins actually saw fit to throw it in here.  Has he no shame?   <br />Meanwhile, the characters are one-dimensional and wooden, veritable  cardboard cutouts about whom I found it difficult to care.  The romantic  interest aspects of the book are downright corny, with the highly  predictable trajectory of the two heroes' love relationships portrayed in  formulaic, clichéd fashion. <br />Overall, I might recommend this book to a  very young reader who is attracted to stories composed of frenetic, nonstop  'action' without the necessity of a lot of heart or intelligence.  But  everyone else beware: this book makes Childs and Preston seem like Faulkner  and Hemingway by comparison.	2000-08-21

Of these  &quot;ballad mysteries,&quot; this is one of the very best.  It involves  several interwoven stories of tragedy, death, and the tenacity of the human  spirit. In writing *The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter*, McCrumb has shown  herself to be a skilled storyteller indeed, able to keep the several  threads of plot moving simultaneously without confusing the reader nor  compromising the nuances of the various tales she tells.  <br />Along the way,  she successfully conveys to readers her convictions regarding some sad  realities of Appalachian life: the isolation, the poverty, the damage to  health and environment caused by industrial pollution, and the  all-too-familiar spectre of tragedy and death that stalk this  ever-struggling region.  At the same time, she celebrates the beauty of the  mountains and shows that the pride and dignity of its people are something  to be cherished and admired.<br />Yes, the prose itself is perhaps too simple,  direct, and unadorned for this to be considered a truly serious work of  literature, and some of the elements of &quot;mystery&quot; were not hard  to figure out well in advance of their being revealed.  However, I enjoyed  every page of this novel, and it will definitely inspire me to read more of  McCrumb's Appalachian writings.	2000-08-14

Stein apparently started out as a &quot;liberal,&quot; but the book shows  clearly that his erstwhile positions were pretty much the knee-jerk result  of conditioning, rather than of his having studied philosophy, political  history, and the comparative merits of various approaches to public policy.   Consequently, when the personal and positional warts possessed by many  people  on the left become apparent to Stein, he flip flops and decides  that the opposite views are actually the correct ones.  The problem here is  that once again he fails to do the necessary historical and philosophical  homework that might have helped him to understand the actual basis and  consequences of various political postures.  The liberals are frequently  shallow, shrill, unfair, and hypocritical, he reasons, so their enemies  must actually be my friends.  This is all too common a political trajectory  for Angry White Guys, but it doesn't make it any less shallow and  unthinking.<br />Along the way, some of the anecdotes he offers are amusing  enough, and involve repulsively alienating characters associated with  various liberal causes with which most of us by now are all too familiar.   The problem with the book and with Stein's &quot;conversion,&quot; however,  is that nowhere does he ever get to the heart of the matter when it comes  to the actual historical bases for liberal vs. conservative views,  personalities and irritating behaviors aside.  Just because  &quot;liberal&quot; positions can be abused, exaggerated, and used as  platforms to unfairly bludgeon opponents does not mean that the positions  themselves are not justified.  Does Stein really believe in gutting  environmental regulations, legalizing discrimination in the workplace,  spending billions of dollars on unnecessary weapons systems, proping up  right-wing dictatorships around the world, keeping women and minorities in  their historically subordinate places, defending the purchase of  armor-piercing bullets, and on and on?  He probably doesn't even think in  such terms; he just seems more emotionally comfortable listening to Rush  Limbaugh blast &quot;feminazis&quot; and defend the misunderstood virtues  of poor put-upon white breadwinners everywhere.  Unfortunately, that's  about as far as his &quot;political analysis&quot; goes in this book.	2000-07-29

Let's face it: radio airtime these days is just brimming with cranks, cretins, and political wackos.  For those of us who have had our fill of Dr. Laura and Rush And The Dittoheads, a man like Dean Edell represents a  veritable breath of fresh air. Ex-hippie Edell is an erudite, intelligent,  and compassionate radio M.D. who cuts through the multilayered nonsense  surrounding contemporary health issues and to provide information and  wisdom over the airwaves daily.  Consequently, to now have available a  full-length book by Dr. Edell is a wonderful thing, indeed.  <br />Edell makes  his living answering on-the-air listener questions about health issues.  He  does not prescribe, he shies away from on-the-air diagnoses, and he never  bullies his listeners the way certain other talk show hosts habitually do.   Instead, he listens, he supports, and he offers sensible advice based upon  the latest medical information available.  Edell and his staff review  health and medical journals by the score, trying to sort out the good  studies from the bad, the useful conclusions from the quackery.  As a  result, he is always worth listening to, and in this case, definitely worth  reading.<br />Edell does not simply proffer &quot;information&quot;; to be  sure, his own viewpoint and values are integrally a part of the  presentation.  But in doing so, he combines knowledge and critical thinking  with compassion and a humanistic concern for others.  The resulting  formulations are in my opinion wise, mature, good-humored, and learned.   <br />Overall, his philosophy is represented by the title of the book,  &quot;Eat, Drink &amp; Be Merry.&quot;  This does not mean we should live  our lives with desperate and reckless abandon (since &quot;tomorrow we may  die&quot;), but instead that we should accept basically who we are, live in  the moment and enjoy life, rather than fretting uselessly over how *long*  our lives will be and whether or not our physical appearance is as perfect  asthat of various movie stars or models.  In supporting this philosophical  conclusion, Edell demonstrates that drastic dieting and strenuous exercise  are of limited benefit to most people, that most people who live to be one  hundred years old spend those last decades in ill health, and that to a  great extent, &quot;happiness&quot; itself is an elusive product of inborn  disposition, rather than the result of following any particular formula,  strategy, or philosophy.  <br />Edell shows courage (and to my way of  thinking, common sense) when he questions the ferocity of our various wars  on drugs, arguing that neither long-term heroin use nor casual recreational  marijuana use are nearly as destructive to society overall as are the legal  use of alcohol and tobacco.  No, he does not come out and advocate any  particular policies, but his message that we should rethink our current  drug laws and policies is quite clear.<br />Overall, Edell eschews health  fanaticism of all types and urges us to &quot;lighten up&quot; in our  approach to health issues.  A diet high in fruits and vegetables and  reasonably low in fat, a regular but not punitive exercise regimen, an  avoidance of smoking and heavy drinking, and a general avoidance of  excessive stress and worry seem to be what he's calling for in this book.   Edell certainly doesn't address all of the possible questions readers might  have about health, diet, and lifestyle, but people who read this book will  definitely finish it wiser and better-informed than they were when they  first picked it up.	2000-07-25

Child and Preston have created their best novel to date here, a combination of archaological/anthropological fact and mystery thriller fiction that is hard to put down once begun.  The southwestern setting,  specifically the canyon country of the Colorado basin is skillfully (and  for the most part, accurately) drawn, and there is enough actual historical  information about the Anasazi and their mysterious legacy to render the  book &quot;educational,&quot; to a degree.  Also noteworthy is the improved  character development the authors have provided this time around.  Whereas  in *Riptide* just about all of the characters were of the carboard-cutout  type, the people who animate *Thunderhead* actually display a few internal  conflicts and contradictions.  Tolstoy it's not, but for a quick summertime  read, I don't think we should raise the bar TOO high.  <br />The ending, while  filled with interesting twists and turns, is manically theatrical, perhaps  too much so. But given the grandiose and dramatic plot lines that develop  throoughout the preceding hundreds of pages, a Hollywood-type ending is  surely forgivable here.  If you want Great Literature, look elsewhere, but  if you want a fun and absorbing read, this book might just be for you.	2000-06-30

The suggested  forced interbreeding with an otherwise benign alien race brings us face to  face with our collective uneasiness regarding being genetically manipulated  to the point where we might no longer be truly &quot;human.&quot; <br />So  far, so good--Butler's imagination and vision are truly exemplary, and  these alone make the novel worthwhile.  However, there are aspects of the  work that I found irritating--most notably, the exceedingly low esteem in  which Butler apparently holds just about all human beings, particularly  males.  One does not have to be a Pollyanna about human nature to find the  human subjects of the Oankali experiment to be almost uniformly jarringly  boorish, shallow, and pathological.  The other aspect of the novel I found  lacking was its literary style.  Whereas Butler spins her tale in a  careful, well-crafted fashion, the writing itself is generally sparse, even  dull. No one will mistake this for the work of say, Ursula LeGuin.  Consequently, there were times when, despite the fascinating events being  described in the book, I found it a chore to force myself to keep reading.  In the end, I certainly am glad I stuck it out, but it shouldn't have been  such a struggle.	2000-06-07

Even after 630+ pages, I was sorry to come to the end of the book.  To this I must add: based on some other reviews I have read, a  prerequisite for reading *A Son of the Circus* evidently is development of  an attention span longer than that typical of today's channel-surfing,  sound-byte-seeking generation.<br />The plot is Byzantine and carefully-woven,  but ultimately predictable in some ways.  The story and its ending are not  particular strengths of the novel, but are mainly vehicles for Irving's  skillful neo-Dickensian depiction of contemporary India--more specifically,  some of its colorfully bizarre social settings and the diverse  personalities that animate these unusual environments. <br />Oh, the  characters!  I will miss them so!  The endlessly fascinating personages who  appear, disappear, and reappear throughout this lengthy narrative provide  the very heart of Irving's masterpiece.  There are so many!  Particularly  unforgettable are the actor John D., whose alter ego is his  forever-sneering on-screen persona, Inspector Dhar; John D.'s garrulous and  impulsive Jesuit missionary twin (long-lost, of course!); the crippled  elephant boy, with his dreams of skywalking on the circus high wire; the  staid and forever disapproving steward at the exclusive Duckworth social  club, at which much of the principal action in the novel occurs; the  twisted and tortured transsexual, Rahoul; and finally, at the center of  this circus there is the essential straight man, Dr. Farruk Daruwalla, a  childrens' orthopedic surgeon (and screenwriter) who splits his time  between his native India and his adoptive home in Toronto, where he feel  &quot;always an immigrant.&quot;  Complementing these unforgettable  characters is a lengthy cast of dwarfs, transsexuals, prostitutes, drug  dealers, drunks, drifters, and other assorted misfits and freaks.  As  always, Irving shows his affinity for the strange and tortured underside of  human existence.<br />At one level, the novel is simply another of Irving's  jaundiced romps through the absurd, the socially marginal, and the  unspeakable, and the author's typically ironic dry wit can lull the reader  into thinking this is all just a lengthy exercise in twisted humor and  world-weary cynicism.  But there is so much more!  In the end, Irving has  succeeded in creating a profound, complex, poignant, and moving portrait  not only of the rich and glorious chaos that is contemporary India, but of  humanity as a whole.	2000-05-06

Instead of being bombarded with an encyclopedic but chaotic assemblage of  rock types and unconnected microprocesses, the reader is treated to a  consistent and comprehensive picture of how California came to be that  hangs together remarkably well.  <br />Harden utilized the recent research of  countless other geologists to put together this book, and her hard work has  paid off.  She includes several chapters that provide a conceptual overview  of geologic principles, then goes on in successive sections to describe how  various forces and processes related ultimately to plate tectonics have  been responsible for the evolution of various distinctive landforms and  geomorphic regions of California.  She also includes a final chapter that  is a stand-alone summary version of the &quot;geological history of  California.&quot;  Throughout the book, she makes clear again and again how  a clear understanding of the various ways that tectonic plates can interact  is absolutely fundamental to understanding how California has come into  existence over the past several hundred million years.  It's a fascinating  story, and Harden's text will help anyone willing to read carefully and  study a bit to learn the basics of California geology.<br />As an added bonus,  Harden has included several sections that are linked to present-day  environmental hazards, most notably those related to the constant threat of  earthquakes in the Golden State.  Such information is, of course linked  directly to the geology of the state that she has described and explained  so well.<br />The illustrations and diagrams re not terribly elaborate, but  they are helpful and reasonably plentiful.  Also included are some  small-sized versions of the standard California geology and fault maps.<br />The main drawback to this publication is its astronomical price.  This  is hardly Harden's fault, however, as high prices seem to be the  unfortunate standard for college textbooks these days.	2000-05-01

John McPhee does not succeed in rendering these processes &quot;simple,&quot; but he does a fine, literate, and remarkably  lucid job of explaining some of the basics as no previous author has been  able to do.  <br />Most significantly, McPhee is one of the first writers to  apply recent developments in the field of plate tectonics to California's  geological story.  Most exciting, perhaps, is his discussion of the ways in  which California itself has been &quot;assembled&quot; from various pieces  and processes, all of these the results of the various ways that tectonic  plate boundaries can interact.  The immense granitic batholith that forms  the backbone of the mighty Sierra Nevada, for example, is the result of the  Mesozoic melting and recrystalization (as granodiorite)of the now-defunct  Farallon Plate as it slid beneath the neighboring North American plate to  the east. The currently existing Sierra range itself has been raised to its  present height only recently (mostly within the past three million years)  through faulting associated with crustal stretching that apparently extends  clear across the Great Basin.  <br />Perhaps even more interestingly, the  Sierra foothills and several other portions of the state exhibit peculiar  rock types and geology as a result of their actually having been shoved and  glommed onto the continent in bits and pieces, the result of ancient plate  movements that brought &quot;exotic terrances&quot; to the present location  of California from great distances away. <br />More recently (and geological  terms, thirty million years is indeed &quot;recent&quot;), the tectonic  plate boundary along the length of California has changed from one  characterized by subduction to one in which the Pacific Plate is now  sliding slowly northwestward past the North American Plate.  The principal  boundary between these plates is the San Andreas Fault--hence, the major  effect of this particular form of plate collision is the frequent  earthquakes with which Californians have become so terribly familiar.<br />The  story of how these ever-changing plate interactions have  &quot;assembled&quot; California is a fascinating one, and McPhee tells it  well.  Along the way, he provides more than just geological information.   He also includes historical insights into the California Gold Rush (while  also explaining in geological terms where the gold originally came from),  and provides colorful descriptions of California's history of great  earthquakes. <br />Although McPhee tries his best to make the complex geology  of ophiolite sequences, etc., comprehensible to the non-geologist, there's  very likely some frustrating reading here for people with no previous  background in the intricacies of plate tectonics.  Also, the lack of  adequate maps and diagrams is a handicap.  Were such illustrations  provided, some of the plate relationships and historical progrssions of  landscape formation would be far easier to envision.<br />Still, this is a  &quot;must read&quot; for anyone interested in gaining an understanding of  how California's landscape has been formed over the past several hundred  million years.	2000-04-28

Write your own novels, people! <br />That said, I  can now declare that I think *A Thousand Acres* is a good, but not  &quot;great&quot; novel.  Jane Smiley is an excellent writer, and although  the book starts a bit slowly, the momentum and intrigue build as pages fly  by.  Her ability to describe the landscapes, moods, and rhythms of  midwestern farm life is commendable, and for me, this proved to be perhaps  the most consistently satisfying aspect of the book.<br />The plot can only be  described as &quot;dark,&quot; perhaps excessively so to seem plausible.   Incest, insanity, suicide, the casual plotting of vengeful  murders--anything that might form the basis for an extended commentary on  the possibilities for depravity in the Human Condition--it's all here!   There is so much depravity here, in fact, that after a while I found myself  (figuratively) rolling my eyes at each new twist in the plot.  A bit over  the top, Jane!  <br />I confess that I found it dismaying that each and every  male character in the book proved himself to be rotten, exhibiting behavior  ranging anywhere from insensitive clottishness to  manipulative and smarmy  don Juanism to ranting, bullying, incest-practicing insanity.  What a bunch  of great guys!  In all fairness, the women in the book aren't much better.   The book's protagonist seems to be the one island of reasonableness until  the surprising (and in my view, implausible) plot twist that proves that  she, too, is capable of ANYTHING (I don't feel I should give the plot away  here :-) ).<br />Overall, the book is gripping, well-written, and certainly  worth reading.  To my taste, however, Jane Smiley has gone a bitover the  top in her portrayal of characters and in some aspects of the plot.  The  book ultimately turns into a veritable caricature of a &quot;dark novel  revealing the hideous inner secrets that lie behind the placid  facade,&quot; blah, blah, blah.	2000-02-27
US	52841075	R269UFP1R45J0U	0451160673	768113008	The Love You Make	Books	4	13	21	N	N	Surprisingly, the best Beatle bio yet written	It's been thirty years now since the Beatles split up, and yet to date there has not yet been written the *definitive* story of the Fab Four and their legacy.  In this 1983 release, Peter Brown, a longtime business  associate of the Beatles, gives his particuar slant on their saga, and the  result is a highly engrossing book that anyone interested in the group  should definitely read. Brown and ghost writer (?) Steven Gaines do a  commendably thorough job of tracing the group's origins, rise, and demise,  and along the way there are enough juicy tidbits and revelations to satisfy  most Beatlemaniacs, past and present.  <br />However, it's only reasonable  that no one book on the group will succeed in covering all aspects of their  careers with equal depth and insight.  Peter Brown was mainly involved in  the band's business dealings, and it's in this area that the book shines  most brightly.  We learn much about Brian Epstein and his managerial style,  and about the legal squabbling that accompanied the group's breakup. What  is most glaringly missing is adequately in-depth discussion of the Beatles'  musical evolution, including insights into how their &quot;sound&quot; was  developed, how songs were arranged and mixed, and how each member of the  band contributed to the finished product.  Brown does provide a bit of  this, but clearly the musical end of things was not his strength.  I was  also disappointed that so little was said about the work of George Martin,  whose wisdom and skills were so vital to the group's success.  <br />It  remains for someone else to write another Beatle biography (hopefully  soon), one that will complement Brown's by focusing more on the music  rather than the business end of the Beatles' all-too-short time together.	2000-02-26

Apparently, *Family Pictures* was written quite a bit earlier in her career, and to my  mind, it reflects the &quot;all dressed up and nowhere to go&quot;  tendencies of many a younger writer who has not quite found her literary  voice.  <br />Sue Miller can flat-out write, there is no doubt about that.   Her prose is polished, smooth, and engrossing, incorporating fine cadence,  descriptive language, and an unusual ability to capture skillfully some of  the feelings or thoughts that she attributes to particular  characters.<br />However, overall, this book spins its wheels a lot.  Despite  the length of the book and the enormous amount of description used with  respect to revealing the inner lives of the characters, I never got the  feeling that these personalities were really developed fully.  Who were  these people, and why did they do what they did in this story?  Too often,  the answers were not forthcoming.  <br />The unifying thread in the saga is  the birth, life, and death of an autistic child, Randall.  We learn some  significant things about the other characters that apparently are responses  to Randall's tragic situation.  But aside from these clearly laid-out  character facets, the deeper issues of what makes each character  &quot;tick&quot; and *why* too often remain fairly obscure.  <br />Part of the  problem, I think, is the &quot;snapshot&quot; approach that Miller uses to  develop the novel.  She skips from character to character (and there are a  lot of people in this family), and from year to year, sometimes in dizzying  fashion.  As a result, it seems like there is a lot of frenzied activity  and emotional drama that never really seems tied together adequately.<br />As  I neared the end of the book, I was hoping for some episode or sequence  that would somehow bring the many loose ends together.  But the ending wasjust as disconnected as was much of the rest of the book.<br />Overall, this  is not a bad novel, just one that reflects, I think, an author who has not  yet mastered her craft.  There is a certain triumph of style over substance  here that I find troubling. In later books, Miller's work seems to me far  more cohesive and deep.	2000-02-16

In this book, he takes on one of the significant workplace issues of the last decade, sexual harrasment in the major  corporation.  So far, so good.  However, Crichton falls flat by attempting  to make his point about how &quot;complex&quot; this issue is by presenting  a role reversal situation in which a one-dimensionally ambitious and  ruthless female executive all but rapes a male underling.  He claims he is  doing this in order to be more thought-provoking, but I don't believe this.  The situation he presents is highly dubious, and overall the stolid  corporate-teckie as &quot;good guy&quot; and the female she-devil as  &quot;bad girl&quot; theme is calculated to appeal to a target audience of  wonk-male corporate drones who resent the sometimes-unfair consequences of  current affirmative action policies favoring women.  Certainly it's  *possible* that a Meredith Johnson could perform the dastardly deeds  depicted in the novel, but if Critchton wanted to write a book that showed  the everyday realities of sexual harassment in corporate America, he would  have built his plot around female workers being harassed by men, as this is  far and away the most typical manifestation of this problem. All in all,  the plot is lively and snappy, but the characters are cardboard and the  theme not terribly credible.	2000-02-07
US	52841075	R2U389V49KHWO1	0060930004	524429774	The Distinguished Guest	Books	5	55	56	N	N	This novel hit home with me	I was impressed by the intelligence, depth, and power of this novel.  Sue Miller has succeeded here in spinning a tale that makes *real* many issues that I have struggled with personally, including dealing with an aging  parent, the raw edges that inevitably surround familial relationships, the  doubts that so many of us develop in midlife about ourselves, our successes  and failures, and on and on.  So many times as I read this book I found  myself marvelling at how Wilson had captured a thought or a feeling I had  experienced myself--and had thought, naively,was uniquely my own.<br />Then  there is the fine portrayal of Lily, the fiercely independent, articulate,  interpersonally cold yet socially idealistic writer who struggles with her  declining physical and mental capacities from Parkinson's disease.  The way  that Miller approaches and analyzes Lily's past and her own ruminations  about the past is nothing short of masterful.<br />Complementing the  author's incisive depiction of the complex matrix of bonds and divisions  that comprise an extended family, she offers insights into some of the most  divisive and vexing political/social issues of our time, including the  historical struggle of white Americans of good conscience to try to find a  way to act rightly with respect to race relations.  She never preaches, and  never really takes sides when presenting this aspect of her story--but she  demonstrates that she truly *understands* the various experiences,  perspectives, and viewpoints that have emerged in response to this most  contentious of issues.<br />This book impressed me tremendously.  I have no  idea whether this is because in some objective way, Sue Miller has created  here a triumphant work of literature; conversely, it may just be a matter  of this being the right book at the right time for me personally.  Ultimately, I guess it doesn't matter.	2000-01-30

It tries (too hard, I think) to be &quot;inspirational&quot; to women, with its everything-turns-out-great trajectory (kind of like some of those old  &quot;B&quot; movies from the forties), happy coincidences, and  saccharinely portrayed, totally predictable triumphant moments.  There are  lots of squeals of joy, hugs and kisses, and happiness-is-a-warm-puppy  events in this one.  There's even the obligatory &quot;mystical  ingredient&quot; that seems so integral to women's novels these days.  I  suspect Beth Gutcheon can do better.	2000-01-26

The &quot;bad guys&quot; are  unrelentingly bad, while the &quot;good guys&quot; are practically saints.   Perfect, eh? <br />Grisham is a master of the &quot;easy read,&quot; and the  book is excellent in terms of its basic function, which is to entertain.

The loss of  a child is perhaps the ultimate tragedy that an adult can face, and the  very prospect may be too daunting for some potential readers to fathom.   <br />Swick takes this horrifying theme and creates a moving, convincing,  highly readable novel.  The various reactions by different family members,  friends, and acquaintances are all plausible and vividly portrayed.  The  trajectories of the streams-of-consciousness of the protagonist mother and  her son, including the inevitable pangs of guilt, remorse, and disbelief  associated with a tragedy of this magnitude, are skillfully presented.   This is definitely a page-turner that, once begun, is very hard to put  down.<br />On the downside, there is definitely the feel here of a  made-for-tv-movie-in-the-offing (a &quot;women's movie,&quot; for sure),  and the very nature of the subject matter lends itself to occasional  passages that seem unnecessarily maudlin.  Also, the ending, a kind of  &quot;flash forward to see how it all turned out,&quot; seemed  unsatisfactory to me.  A more ambivalent and indeterminate ending, in which  the reader could imagine varying potential outcomes, would seem more in  keeping with the overall tone of the book.  As it is actually written,  there is a kind of sappiness to the conclusion, a &quot;gee, if we all give  it our best effort and love one another, things will turn out ok&quot;  sentiment that seemed shallow in comparison to the rest of the  book.<br />Still, overall this is a worthwhile read, and it  motivates me to  explore other works by this author.	2000-01-22
US	52841075	RQ55TOPF26YWS	0853452849	359261587	The Myth of Population Control: Family, Caste and Class in an indian Village	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Believers in &quot;population control&quot; should read this book	Since the time of Thomas Malthus, problems of resource scarcity and social pathology have frequently been attributed to &quot;overpopulation,&quot; largely caused by the alleged overbreeding by the world's poor.  If only  those impoverished masses who bear so very many children realized the error  of their ways, the reasoning goes, the &quot;population explosion&quot; and  its attendant problems could be diffused.  Moreover, their own poverty  would be alleviated, since they would have fewer mouths to  feed.<br />Champions of this Malthusian perspective generally have eschewed  any efforts to actually investigate what life is like for the  high-fertility poor who fuel the world's rapid population growth.  In this  slim but incisive book, however, sociologist Mamoud Mamdani demonstrates  that by actually investigating and analyzing social reality from the  perspective of those who choose to have large families, one can gain an  understanding of the rationality behind this lifestyle choice. Indeed, in  his study of a village society in northern India, he shows that these rural  peasants are not poor because they have many children, they have many  children because they are poor.  High fertility is, in fact, a reasonable,  even necessary choice for people with few resources other than their own  labor power and that of their children.  Mamdani shows that only when  people's basic human needs for material security, health care, and support  in old age are met can they begin to consider different life strategies  that do not involve having large numbers of offspring.  <br />When it first  appeared during the 1970's, Mamdani's book was revolutionary in its  influence on the population/resources debate among environmentalists.  Some  hardline neo-Malthusians have refused to budge from their &quot;population  control by any means&quot; position, but many others have come to realize  that for people to be amenable to family planning measures, social and  economic reforms ona large scale must be implemented.  <br />The one area  where Mamdani's perspective is too narrow involves the role of women in  fertility decisions.  His study emphasizes the husband and wife as a  decision-making unit making successive choices regarding additional births.   In reality, however, women often don't have any choice at all as to how  large their finished family size might be, and their husbands frequently  insist on a larger family than the wife might desire.  Indeed, over the  past twenty years, it has become clear that empowering women and providing  them more choices in their lives is another avenue to lower fertility.   <br />Mamdani fails to emphasize this feminist aspect of the population  question, but in presenting a concise and thoughtful analysis of how  population growth occurs at the local level, he has made a lasting  contribution to social and environmental science.	2000-01-18
US	52841075	R2W8LJIC5SNU79	0451188462	562576523	Desperation	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Boilerplate Stephen King, but still a great read	People who have read more than say, two Stephen King novels become accustomed to the fact that they all are, in some ways, the same novel written over and over again, with changes only in locale, characters, and  metaphysical cosmetics.  Hey, he's not the only writer guilty of this  infraction--look at Joyce Carol Oates and the person who wrote the Agatha  Christie mysteries.  <br />One either accepts the &quot;program&quot; or moves  on to another writer.  I happen to enjoy King's work, and continue to  marvel at just how good a writer he is.  His characters are usually  interesting, his descriptions of various environments and places ring true,  and he seems to be able to spin endless variations on his &quot;forces of  evil&quot; theme, which appears in some form or another in all of his  books.<br />I enjoyed the fact that this particular novel had a unique  setting, central Nevada. How much &quot;CentralNevadaLit&quot; is there,  anyway?  The mining town images and lore added an attractive twist, and the  evil force, *Tek*, was fascinating to consider.  <br />I guess what I didn't  like was the &quot;Godspeak&quot; theme.  Not that I'm anti-religious, but  the utilization of God as one of the principal characters in the book  seemed gimmicky somehow.  A God that &quot;intervenes&quot; to create  &quot;miracles&quot; and yet who is also in some puzzling ways  &quot;cruel&quot; belongs on the Christian TV networks more than it does in  horror-scifi novels. Just my two cents' worth.<br />Still, all in all, I  conclude that Mr. King has done it again--he thoroughly entertained me over  a stretch of nearly 700 pages, and I was never bored with what he wrote.   Good show!	1999-12-20

Sure, his work is highly commercial, and his stock in trade is horror and gore, but along the way he also manages to create gripping  plot lines played out by interesting and sympathetic characters whom he  portrays with remarkable depth.  Each one of the former &quot;losers&quot;  who comprise the core group that battles against It in this novel has a  distinct and fascinating background, and King tells each person's story  with passion and precision.  The overall story line in *It* is masterfully  woven through a combination of flashback and contemporary narration.  For  me, the only problems with the book are that the ending seems a bit  formulaic (made for the Big Screen, perhaps?) and that King chose to  include a gratuitious &quot;childhood sex&quot; scene that I, though  certainly no prude, think would better have been omitted.  All in all, *It*  is a darned good read, as Stephen King shows once again that he is as  skillful a writer as he is popular.	1999-12-04

People who expect ALL novels to be lugubrious, heavy, symbol-laden tomes that your favorite (or least favorite) high school English teacher would make you read and then discuss in class endlessly apparently don't like  Dave Barry's work.  To this I say, &quot;LIGHTEN UP, FOLKS!&quot;  There's  a place in most of our lives for a book that is a romp, a lark, a farce, a  string of silly gags.  That's what Dave Barry provides here.  <br />No, Barry  is not (yet) an &quot;accomplished novelist,&quot; and perhaps, given his  style, he never will be.  But this book is FUNNY, people, and aren't some  good laughs worth our time--once in a while--maybe?  <br />In reality, Barry  does put forth a &quot;view of human nature&quot; that is not a flattering  one.  If readers think too long and seriously about the characters in the  book and what they reflect about the human condition, *Big Trouble&quot;  actually could be seen as a dark and brooding work, indeed.<br />But don't  bother to think too hard about such larger themes.

People's expectations of Alison Lurie must be exceedingly high.  This book is not going to change the world, provide people with the answers to life's Big Questions, or garner her another literary prize.  It's a fun read,  however, built upon a simple plot and a group of characters who are only  partially developed.  Light fare, true, but along the way, she manages to  provide some trenchant insights into the human psyche; some of the episodes  and passages are just plain hilarious.  Overall, this is summer vacation  reading fare, but a cut above the usual poolside novel.<br />The only aspect  of the book that annoyed me was the portrayal of the Great Environmentalist  Professor's much younger wife, who comes across as something of a ditz.  A  major theme here is that what this unfulfilled, underappreciated woman  &quot;needs&quot; is another woman in a lesbian relationship.  This is  dubious at best, and detracts from the actual incisiveness of Lurie's  depiction of the classic &quot;faculty wife.&quot;    Still, those who can  accept something less than Nobel Prize material will likely find this a  witty and interesting novel.	1999-10-03

After that, however, things became pretty dicey.  Admittedly, it's difficult for an author to keep characters, themes, and  plot lines fresh and zesty in volume after volume, but perhaps Maupin  should have considered quitting while he was ahead.  This book is different  in that it has a Russian River setting, for the most part, but the plot  really goes nowhere.  He tries to make hay out of lampooning the Bohemian  Club and militant ecofeminists, but most of his verbal arrows miss their  targets.  He also tries to develop a serious subtheme related to the AIDS  crisis as it developed during the eighties.  This is both essential and  admirable, but now, years later, it comes across as preachy and maudlin.   Finally, the inevitable &quot;love interest&quot; involving the gay  protagonist Michael is totally predictable and frankly, really boring.   Were the same dynamics applied in a novel to a heterosexual relationship,  readers would be wringing their hands over the shallowness of the lovers  and their interactions.  <br />Overall, the smarmy smugness of Maupin's basic  message, i.e., &quot;gays and lesbians are really hipper and cooler than  are you boring breeders&quot; has gotten REALLY tiresome by this volume in  the Tales of the City series.  Time to move on, Maupin.	1999-09-29

The book is highly predictable, however, in  that Clark in almost mechanical fashion slants events to justify her own  actions and approaches with regard to the Simpson case. Like just about  anyone in her position, she justifies, rationalizes, dumps on her enemies,  praises her friends, and turns the Simpson trial into a Manichaean struggle  of good vs. evil. <br />Overall, I didn't find her a very appealing  personality.

There are flaws in the book, for sure: the readers are getting a  partial and biased viewpoint, that of the successful prosecuting attorney,  who rarely misses a chance to congratulate himself for his triumphant  strategies and victorious moments; and some of the historical/cultural  interpretation regarding the significance of the Manson family and its  historical role is not overly impressive.  However, given that Bugliosi  worked extremely hard to put together his case and then was indeed  triumphant, is it not understandable that he would &quot;crow&quot; just a  bit?  <br />In reading this book, I was struck by the apparent incompetence of  the Los Angeles Police Department in terms of its handling of evidence, its  sloppy and lazy investigative techniques, and its indifference to  criminological rigor in dealing with the case generally.  Apparently by the  time the O.J. Simpson case emerged decades later, their basic *modus  operandi* had not improved one iota.<br />The &quot;Afterword,&quot; added in  1994, brings the case up to date, including an interesting recounting of  the fates of some of the principals.  What's interesting is that some of  those involved in the various Manson crimes have apparently matured and  demonstrated real remorse for their acts, whereas others have not.  In  particular, Leslie van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel certainly are not the  same persons they were back in 1969-70, and in my opinion, deserve to be  paroled sooner or later.  On the other hand, Manson himself remains  unrepentant and bizarre, and two of his most loyal followers, Squeaky  Fromme and Sandra Goode, have remained under Manson's spell all these many  years.  Squeaky and Sandra now call themselves &quot;Red&quot; and  &quot;Blue,&quot; respectively, and cloak their bizarre, misanthropic  right-wing philosophy in the rhetoric of &quot;deep ecology.&quot;  This  shows how what in many respects is a noble cause, that of &quot;saving the  earth,&quot; can be used instead as &quot;the last refuge of  scoundrels.&quot;  <br />For those interested in learning the details of this  most grisly and yet fascinating of all recent U.S. murder cases, Bugliosi's  book is definitely the place to start.	1999-09-09

Moreover, there are, in fact, some individually funny gags and giggles contained in *Bridget Jones' Diary*.   Overall, however,  reading the book is very much like consuming cotton candy--it seems  superficially appealing, but ultimately it's trivial and unsatisfying.<br />I  would give Fielding some credit for creating the amusingly neurotic diarist  Bridget were she not quite so blatantly just a British version of Cathy  Guisewite's &quot;Cathy&quot; comic strip character.  And the cutesy  incorporation of bits and pieces of *Pride and Prejudice* is handled so  heavy-handedly that it ultimately seems more annoying than clever. <br />Also,  I would be more kindly disposed toward the novel had the ending not been so  amateurish, contrived, and just plain dumb.  By the time I closed this book  for the last time, I confess I was berating myself for having wasted the  time and money on Bridget and her trivial little life.	1999-08-30

In her  short life, she revealed some very fine qualities as a publicizer of  various good causes, but she CLEARLY was a very troubled person who was all  but impossible to deal with, let alone live with.  I had always suspected  that the &quot;Diana is good, the Royals are evil&quot; mantra that so many  people have come to accept as truth was largely the result of Diana's  uncanny capacity to manipulate the media to build her own public image.  Smith's book confirms this.<br />I do have some doubts about taking too  seriously the &quot;borderline personality disorder&quot; diagnosis as the  singular thesis that is supposed to hold the biography together.  Borderline personality disorder impresses me as one of those trendy  ready-made diagnoses that any of us can apply instantly to a good portion  of the people we know.  It's also unclear to me just how this particular  &quot;syndrome&quot; differs from some variant of narcissism, a trendy  diagnosis from years past.  But clearly something was amiss in Diana's  psyche, and it's too bad she was not able to get the help she clearly  needed.<br />The author errs, I think, in waiting until the very end of the  book to try to make sense of the contradictions in Diana's behavior and  personality.  Up to that point, the presentation makes Diana seem very  fragmented and inconsistent, the summation of countless little anecdotes  and perceptions with no apparent center or core.  The author is not really  able to synthesize the considerable research she has done until she finally  brings the &quot;borderline&quot; diagnosis to bear at the very end.  Consequently, even after 368 pages, I never feel that I have understood who  Diana really was, and that's disappointing.pages, I never feel that I have understood who  Diana really was, and that's disappointing.	1999-08-26

US	52841075	R2QVPRF209S9OX	031286437X	49055473	The Dazzle of Day	Books	2	11	19	N	Y	This is Ursula LeGuin on downers, folks	I found this ponderously slow-moving science fiction novel disappointing.  There were, in fact, some potentially interesting elements here: space colonization, a huge spacecraft serving as a long-term artificial living  environment for a large number of people, conflict based around whether or  not a cold, forboding planet should be settled now, as opposed to  &quot;sailing&quot; onward in search of a better destination.  <br />But the  book itself is dull, turgid, and in too many annoying little ways,  implausible.  The colonists appear to be ex-Central American Quaker  peasants (?) with gratuitously weird names who are supposed to communicate  in Esperanto (why?) Whereas this large spacecraft boasts incredibly complex  technologies including, apparently, a &quot;cold fusion&quot; source of  energy (yeah, right), medicinal practices seem to center around the use of  medicinal herbs and the &quot;laying on of hands.&quot;  The characters are  unanimously shallow and dull, and their interactions, while described in  excrutiating detail, are seldom particularly interesting.   The one  promisingly compelling conflict/decision that arises in the entire story  centers upon whether or not the community should end their generations-long  voyage and settle a cold, uninviting planet, as opposed to spending another  fifty or one hundred years sailing on in their self-enclosed space station.   This divisive and vexing issue is &quot;resolved,&quot; however, suddenly  and to my mind, unsatisfactorily through reference to some sappy  philosophical/theological gobbledegook that miraculously overtakes the  group and leads them to agree on a solution.<br />I'm confident that the  author attempted to pattern this book after one of Ursula LeGuin's  anthropologically based utopian/feminist novels.  LeGuin tends to be  long-winded and occasionally turgid, but in the end, she always has  something profound to say.  Molly Gloss is long-winded and turgid, but  unfortunately, offers littleof lasting importance to render the  considerable effort required of readers worthwhile.	1999-08-22

Their concept is certainly exciting, and there a few (though  not a lot) of twists in the plot that could keep moviegoers on the edges of  their seats.<br />But as a novel, this work leaves a lot to be desired.  The  characters are about as sterotyped and one-dimensional as possible, perhaps  as part of the authors' unrelenting efforts to appeal to the Lowest Common  Denominator.  Much of the plot is highly predictable, and brings to mind a  very conscious attempt to combine elements of &quot;Jaws,&quot;  &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; and (yes) &quot;Moby Dick.&quot; <br />It's a fun  summer-read-at-the-beach kind of book, so lots of people will surely enjoy  it.

In *Bellwether*, she includes a lot of fun little historical facts relating to the history of fads, but she  then ruins the lighthearted satirical mood (for me) by harping again and  again in quasi-curmudgeonly fashion on &quot;anti-smoking&quot; as nothing  more than &quot;another aversion fad&quot; apparently perpetrated by  airheads and idiots.  This makes me suspect that she's a smoker who feels  herself persecuted, so she's used this book as a bully pulpit to brand  those who want to eliminate smoke from public places as mere fad followers  who don't &quot;think for themselves.&quot;  Phooey.  In taking this tack,  I think she blew it (so to speak).  Basically, I think that when writing  satire, the author/protagonist either has to be extremely self-deprecating  (like Dave Barry), or else must be prepared to have one's sympathetic  audience limited to those who share his or her own personal  likes/dislikes/prejudices (as overtly political satirists do).  I found  that Willis ultimately comes across as elitist in a sneering rather than  clever way, and the sometimes interesting plot line and intermittent  splashes or humor simply are not enough to transcend this overall  negativity.	1999-08-17

Being from Detroit, his strength is his encyclopedic knowledge of the evolution of the  techno scene in the Motor City.  Although the ultimate relevance of some of  the early material about dance parties and such is never adequately  explained, Sicko reveals the early development of Detroit techno skillfully  and thoroughly.<br />For some other aspects of the history of techno,  perhaps a second book by someone else will be necessary. For one thing,  once Sicko reaches the point in his narrative where techno becomes a  &quot;world-wide&quot; phenomenon, his survey of its proliferation and  evolution is sketchy at best, and misleading and partial at worst.  With  the exception of some acknowledgment of the seventies techno-pop act  Kraftwork, he shortchanges throughout the significant contributions by  Germans (e.g., no mention of Sven Vath, Paul van Dyk, or Oliver Lieb, and  in his discussion of current and future directions in techno, including  offshoots into new musical genres, some unknown artists (undoubtedly of  Sicko's acquaintance) are featured prominently, whereas important styles  such as trance and progressive house are ignored completely.<br />He also  has difficulty conveying what the music is actually like.  I realize that  expressing the essence of one artistic medium in terms of another is  difficult, but someone who has never heard techno would finish the book  with no clearer idea of what &quot;techno&quot; actually is than when he or  she started.  Exactly what techno fans &quot;listen for&quot; in this music  and the role that techno plays within their lives/subculture are also  important, but never discussed adequately.<br />Still, Sicko is a pioneer  here, and deserves credit for what he accomplished in this first attempt at  a &quot;history of techno.&quot;	1999-08-05

In *The Antelope Wife*, however, she  has returned to an approach that is reminiscent of her first and most  triumphant novel, *Love Medicine*.  She writes in a style that may be  difficult for some readers to accept--no,it's not &quot;obscure&quot; in  the sense of a James Joyce novel, but she changes voices, time frames, and  situations constantly.  The result is a tapestry-like narrative that is  uniquely effective, in my view.  Erdrich has a way with words that is rare  in today's literary world, despite the countless novels that are published  annually.  Moreover, because of her own Native American heritage, she is  able to convey with incredible effectiveness the realities of past and  present life and consciousness within those Indian cultures with which she  is familiar.  <br />This is a fine work, one that makes me look forward all  the more to Louise Erdrich's next book.	1999-07-16

There are a lot of characters, a lot of dead bodies, a lot  of &quot;regrets about the past,&quot; a bit of social commentary about the  privileges and power of the super rich, and even a dash of post-Viet Nam  syndrome insanity thrown in for good measure.

Jane Heller clearly has some writing talent and an acerbic sense of humor.  The humor in the book is, in fact, its strongest  quality. But the trajectory of the basic story line in *Crystal Clear* is  indeed crystal clear from about page fifty or so, so there is little real  suspense the rest of the way through.  There's a &quot;whodunit&quot;  aspect to the story, but who the &quot;culprit&quot; is just doesn't seem  particularly important, actually.  The inevitable resolution of the  protagonist's emotional inner conflicts is the actual center of Heller's  narrative, and how things will turn out is abundantly clear almost from the  beginning.  The final portion of the book is very much in the vein of  Danielle Steele, and that is NOT a compliment, folks.   I would recommend  the book to someone looking for a fluffy summer-by-the-pool read that  includes some gentle but competently executed satire on the New Age  movement.  But what frustrates me is that it is very clear that Jane Heller  could write something a lot more memorable than this.	1999-07-03

I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that this  novel is inspired, witty, and socially ignificant without being excessively  preachy.  The narrative voice of Cadence Roth is convincing, the supporting  characters are not just cardboard cutouts, and the story line has enough  unpredictable twists and turns to keep a reader turning the pages with  anticipation right up until the ending, which I found powerful, indeed.   <br />I liked this book a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking  for a novel that is both entertaining and thoughtful.	1999-06-26

Unfortunately, there is little local flavor in the book, and what is  included is just as often inaccurate as correct.  One character takes the  BART system down the Peninsula when going home from San Francisco; this is  fantasy, pure and simple.  There also are discussions of  &quot;mergers&quot; between affluent Palo Alto and struggling East Palo  Alto, an eventuality that is not only politically unlikely but hindered by  the fact that these two cities are located in different counties.  <br />Aside  from this, what Green essentially provides here is a portrait of a number  of desperate young African American Stanford students and their sometimes  shadowy worlds.  There isn't much plot here, but the character portrayals  are interesting enough to make the book worth reading.	1999-06-26

I found *Babycakes* to be more satisfying than the previous book (which featured the Reverend Jim Jones,  among other absurdities), but it clearly is not as inspired as the first  two novels in this series.<br />Maupin is at his witty and irreverent best in  his depiction of the small details related to the life and times of his  characters.  The plot of this story, however, borders on the inane at  times.  There are too many unbelievable coincidences, too many fortuitous  events and moments.  I also have grown weary of the ever-present subtexts  of gay/lesbian hipness and the shallow Wonderfulness of the transsexual  Anna Madrigal.  This all seemed kind of refreshing twenty years ago, but by  now it comes across as tiresome and preachy.  Of course, this book was  written in the early eighties, so it may just be a case of the material  becoming somewhat dated.  <br />The book makes for a quick, easy, and fun  read.  Great literature, however, it's not.	1999-06-18

But at the time, few good writers were even  attempting to penetrate into the &quot;real life&quot; experience of  ordinary Americans.  His efforts so many years ago are all the more  valuable today, however, since it provides us a glimpse of what life was  *really* like for some people in much-romanticized &quot;small town  America.&quot;  <br />This novel is really a collection of loosely  interrelated short stories, or perhaps even a series of character sketches,  but so what?  The value here is in the individual images and insights that  Anderson provides, not in any emergent &quot;plot.&quot;<br />The glimpses  into the inner lives of ordinary Americans and the fine descriptions of  place, mood, and events that Anderson provides in this work still speak to  some readers, at least, today. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.	1999-06-13

It is frightening but true that his premise that the  government might secretly develop and test a disease organism that augments  intelligence but then kills seems more credible today than it did when he  wrote the story decades ago.  <br />However, as the story develops, Disch's  narrative slips further and further into a succession of obscure literary,  philosophical, and religious allusions that only those steeped deeply in  arcane intellectual works will understand, let alone appreciate.  There are  lengthy passages that I found frustratingly obscure, and overall, I felt  that in the last part of the novel the work loses its original sharp edge  and intensity. Perhaps for the chosen few with the proper intellectual  pedigree to connect with the veritable cavalcade of allusions, quotations,  and metaphors, the work will seem far more meaningful.  For the rest of us,  it ends up being an interesting but in some ways unsatisfying read.	1999-06-03

What he succeeds in  showing is that, in fact, the &quot;rave culture&quot; is about drugs, sex,  violence, and a slacker ethic.  <br />And did I mention drugs?<br />I can't  imagine that anyone could find the protagonists in this book sympathetic,  or even particularly interesting.  Aside from the perfunctory declaration  of peace, love, respect, etc., that is the pledge-of-allegiance-like mantra  of the rave culture, these guys apparently stand for nothing except their  own aimless self-indulgence and a voracious appetite for drugs, which they  consume in endless quantities and varieties.<br />Even the material about the  music, which could have been the most interesting part of the narrative, is  fragmented and perfunctory.  The author drops a few names, provides some  very basic descriptions of differing electronic music styles, and then  quickly returns to his real focus, the drugs.<br />The young people whose  misadventures form the basis for the novel might easily have portrayed as  confused and harmless, but Beverage actually shows them to be monsters of a  sort.  In one section, they invade a private home to use the telephone, but  when the homeowner returns unexpectedly, one of the group, high on drugs  (of course) beats the hapless gentleman into a coma with a golf club.  The  reader is &quot;relieved&quot; to learn, however, that the merry band of  ravers escapes without arrest and then quickly forgets about the whole  incident--hey, whatever!  <br />If Beverage thinks he is going to create  sympathy for the rave culture through this kind of effort, he is mistaken.   Actually, it would not surprise me at all if the book is a kind of put-on,  a parody, or perhaps even something created by a member of the Christian  Right in a &quot;mole&quot;-like attempt tomake the rave culture appear  far more dreary, corrupt, and hopeless than it actually is.<br />The only  reason I gave the book two stars instead of one is that I am guessing the  book is the novelist's first book, and he should perhaps be cut a bit of  slack in its debut :-).	1999-05-31

Along the way, he examines California and Californians, and consequently is able to offer some fresh insights into  life in the Golden State.<br />The book is presented as a series of vignettes,  based on his experiences in various locations along the fault from Humboldt  County south to the Salton Sea.  Not surprisingly, some sections are more  effective than others.  His treatment of the legacy of Indian massacres in  the Eureka area is hauntingly vivid, as is his analysis of Ferndale's  attempts to resist losing its soul to commercialization and yuppification.   He also provides what ultimately proves to be a passionate discourse on the  never-ending controversy over logging and clearcutting along the north  coast.<br />Another excellent section of the book comes much later, when he  explores the hellish new suburban landscape of Palmdale, in the Antelope  Valley,  His dissection of the emptiness of &quot;the suburban dream&quot;  in that sad community is masterful.<br />Perhaps surprisingly, the weakest  aspect of the book is his treatment of geology and earthquakes.  He gives  WAY too much space and credence to earthquake prediction quackery,  including folks who *claim* to predict quakes through headaches, planetary  alignment, and the analysis of radio waves.  Here, Clarke comes across as  gullible and a bit too eager to find &quot;some grain of truth&quot; in  pseudo-science.  <br />Also, whereas one cannot expect any book of this scope  to be error-free, Clarke commits some small factual blunders here that can  grate on the reader who knows better. He misterms an earthquake's  &quot;hypocenter&quot; as its &quot;hydrocenter,&quot; and actually, the  phenomenon he is referring to is its &quot;focus.&quot; He misplaces the  feisty coastal town of Bolinas in &quot;East Marin,&quot; and he cites the  Coalinga earthquake as having occurred in 1982, instead of 1983.<br />In a  lengthy book of this kind, I suppose such errors can be overlooked.  The  freshness of Clarke's insights and his skill as a journalist make this book  well worth reading for any student of California history and culture.	1999-05-27

The book is a definite page-turner, drawing the reader in with exciting, non-stop action and inventive, image-evoking  prose.  However, I ultimately was disturbed by Boyle's commercialized,  superficial treatment of the issues he confronts in this novel.  Especially  when a book is entertainingly written, it is easy for readers to forget  that the novelist has nearly limitless power to manipulate his readers  through story line, tone, and character development. Consequently,  fictional accounts of &quot;significant issues&quot; can easily be mistaken  for &quot;documentary treatments,&quot; with unfortunate results.  Here,  Boyle seduces the reader with superficially realistic portrayals of the  illegal alien protagonists and their Topanga Canyon liberal-yuppie  counterparts.  Actually, however, his characters are merely cardboard  cut-out stereotypes who dance like marionettes in accordance with Boyle's  ideological predilections--which turns out to be tiresomely predictable in  way that he pillories &quot;hypocritical yuppies&quot; and romanticizes  poor, &quot;martyred&quot; Mexicans immigrants.  Boyle had an opportunity  here to create a work in which the real tragedy of contemporary California  is demonstrated, i.e., that well-meaning people of all backgrounds and  situations are cast into a difficult situation over which they ultimately  have little or no control.  Boyle does follow this pathway for much of the  book, but as the ending nears, he succumbs to the temptation to manipulate  his readers by revealing, bit by bit, the truly vile nature of supposed  &quot;liberals.&quot;   Yawn.  This sanctimonious stance has become all too  predictable among the artistic/academic set, whose principal intent  ultimately seems to be to seek and hold the moral high ground against their  unenlightened professional-managerial class rivals. This book ultimately  disappoints.The issue of illegal immigration, its impacts and social  repercussions, is far too important to be reduced to the soap-opera themes  and characterizations to which Boyle ultimately succumbs.	1999-02-13

His book is filled with gold  nuggets of information and interpretation regarding the inner workings of  one of the world's most fascinating metropolitan areas.  However, what  bothered me about the book was the haughty, sanctimonious tone of much of  Davis' prose. Apparently, Davis believes that only people from the  neo-Marxist left are motivated by a genuine desire for social justice or  environmental quality.  Everyone else is portrayed as having a hidden  agenda of self-interest, one way or another.  The wealthier classes are  presented in reductionist fashion as selfish persecutors of the less  fortunate, and the underprivileged themselves are one-dimensionally victims  of this persecution.  This myopic aspect of leftist interpretation is  insulting to the actual people of greater Los Angeles, who in reality are  motivated by a complex mixture of individual ambition, fear, idealism, and  &quot;class interest,&quot; and are hardly the shallow stereotypes that  Davis portrays them to be. The holier-than-thou tone of Davis' narrative  becomes tiresome after a time, and reflects one major reason for the  continued unpopularity of leftist thinking in this country.	1999-01-24

After all, Tom Wolfe has long had a certain smarmy arrogance about him, what with his tailored white suits and superior attitude. He has always impressed me as a kind of literary  publicist for the very power structure that he (sometimes) purports to  skewer in his books.  I had, in fact, come to think of him in terms of the  label that Alexander Cockburn applied to him years ago, &quot;A philistine  masquerading as a social critic.&quot;  <br />But I have to admit it: this  book is nothing short of excellent.  Wolfe has produced a highly crafted,  gorgeously written page-turner, richly embossed with descriptive detail and  enlivened with a plot filled with fascinating twists and turns.  <br />Of  course, Wolfe returns to one of his favorite themes here, the American  macho entrepreneurial mover and shaker, and what makes him tick.  Many of  his best sections, in fact, involve confrontations between powerful men in  which the testosterone veritably flies off the page.  What's particularly  fascinating is that it never becomes clear (to me, anyway), just whether  Wolfe is trying to lampoon American Manhood or in his own droll way,  celebrate it. Perhaps both.<br />Another aspect of the book that impressed me  was the painstaking accuracy of Wolfe's usage of geographical and  historical material.  I can't speak for all of his Atlanta references, but  in his discussions of various locations in the San Francisco Bay Area where  I live, he was unerringly correct in terms of place names, how one places  relates spatially to another, what the weather is like at this or that time  or year, and an assortment of other details that many other writers  annoyingly get wrong.<br />Some readers will dislike the book as a work of  literature because it is a &quot;best-seller,&quot; i.e., it is highly  lucid and accessible, and hence does not lend itself to  &quot;deconstruction&quot; or other avant-garde exercises in literary  voyeurism.  To that, I say, BRAVO!	1998-11-18

More importantly, however, the man can turn a phrase; I had a  hard time putting this book down.	1998-11-12

Delillo does some imaginative and  interesting things in terms of presentation, and I could support his  experimentation if he actually had something important to say along the  way.  But his actual messages, insights, themes, characterizations, etc.,  are tedious, stodgy, and often dull.  I began this book expecting to learn  something important about &quot;American life during and after the Cold  War.&quot;  I was disappointed.  To begin with, the very notion that a home  run hit by the New York Giants' Bobby Thomson in 1951 is somehow worthy of  world-historical attention reeks of a sports chic (read: baseball, and  sometimes soccer) pretentiousness that has become all the rage among  American literatii.  It was just a baseball game, folks.  Consequently, the  use of that baseball as a &quot;symbol&quot; or thread to hold the novel  together seemed interminably ridiculous to me.  Similarly, the   &quot;insights&quot; about American life, the Cold War, etc., that spout  from the lips of Delillo's characters fall flat more often than not.   <br />Certainly, the man has good command of the English language, and he can  turn a phrase.  But that doesn't substitute for REALLY having something  vital to say that makes it worth wading through 800+ pages of prose that is  turgid, fragmented, meandering, and to my mind, excessively and pointlessly  &quot;artsy.&quot;  For me, it just didn't work.	1998-10-19

He is one of those authors who can  draw his readers in and make us want to keep turning those pages until the  book is finished.  The accessibility of his prose serves to remind us that  deep, thoughtful, moving narrative need not be &quot;artistically  obscure,&quot; as so much so-called great literature seems to be.  <br />The  characters in the book are wonderfully portrayed and the themes  well-developed.  The introduction of &quot;Papa's manuscript&quot; in the  last portion of the book seemed curious to me at first, but by the end of  the book its power and purpose became apparent.  It can be pointed out that  a simple, Sicilian-born factory worker would not likely write an  autobiographical work with the degree of shocking self-disclosure that  &quot;Papa's&quot; manuscript contains; nor would we expect his writing to  be so consistently gripping.  But this bit of literary licence exercised by  Lamb is forgivable in the context of the work as a whole.<br />The greatest  flaw in the novel is its corny, Hollywood-style ending, in which both the  loose ends in the plot and the many tortuous questions of existence raised  in the first 800 pages seem to be wrapped up quickly and neatly--way *too*  quickly and neatly.  Some downbeat or at least ambiguous threads should  have been included--this would have been more consistent with the  &quot;life is a crapshoot&quot; message that is developed during nearly the  entire rest of the book.<br />However, in light of the magnificence of Lamb's  literary achievement as a whole, the &quot;watch for the film version&quot;  ending is forgiveable, I suppose.	1998-08-23

Reneaux	We rented this cassette from our local library to take on a family  vacation recently, and it proved to be a &quot;monster hit&quot; with our  two sons, ages 11 and 7.  The stories are wonderfully imaginative and just  spooky enough to keep children's attention all the way through.  J.J.  Reneaux is an expert storyteller--her delivery, inflection, and style are  masterful, indicating that she has practiced the nearly lost art of  storytelling for  long time.  To make the presentation even better, there  are expertly created special sound effects in the background, giving the  stories a richer atmosphere than merely &quot;telling&quot; them could ever  accomplish.  Great tape!	1998-08-23

Here,  the writing is a bit more substantial and there are some interesting twists  and turns in the plot. As a serious mystery, however, the work falls flat.  McCrumb is at her best as a humorist, particularly when she is lampooning  particular human stereotypes, such as sci-fi fanatics. But she hasn't  really mastered the art of creating a convincing mystery that draws the  reader in and then is wrapped up in convincing fashion at book's end.	1998-08-21

Karen Joy Fowler has written a novel that marks out a genre all its own, as it is not quite an &quot;historical novel,&quot; not quite science fiction, not quite feminist fiction, and not quite fantasy.  It succeeds in being imaginative, politically astute, and historically informative, however, as Ms. Fowler uses the events of the story as a vehicle for including endless anecdotes, &quot;fun facts,&quot; and asides that reveal her vast and intricate knowledge of U.S. political and social history. There's even a plethora of &quot;homemaker tips&quot; included, for good measure.  The plot is not the point here; in this novel, the &quot;journey is the reward,&quot; as each and every page includes verbal gems and incisive bits of social commentary and are endlessly engrossing and enlightening.	1998-07-29
US	52841075	R395XA3HSS63R5	0553573357	487389793	Blue Mars (Mars Trilogy)	Books	3	9	16	N	Y	Promising trilogy comes to bloated, sloppy conclusion	Let's face it: the best book in Robinson's Mars trilogy is the first one.  After that, he coasts for another 1300+ pages, perhaps realizing that many readers will finish the trilogy either on principle or out of some internally driven obsessive compulsion (I probably fit into the latter category).<br />The final book in the trilogy is easily the weakest.  The plot is plodding and uninteresting, the descriptions of the planet as its &quot;terraforming&quot; process continues are excessive and often boring, and the now-ancient surviving members of the &quot;First Hundred&quot; are insufferably always the same.  Robinson knows a LOT about many contemporary fields of science, and it's to his credit that he attempts to share this knowledge with his readers.  However, his presentations of this information usually take the form of long, cul-de-sac-like digressions which left me with the impression that Robinson chose to use this final Mars novel as a kind of bully pulpit to publi! cize his particular viewpoints regarding various scientific controversies.  He also shows a vigorous and sometimes refreshing interest in the possibilities for new political and economic structures in the future, but ultimately, his ideas seem a muddle.  He introduces, for example, the notion that there might be a &quot;good&quot; transnational corporation in the future that can play the financial and technological White Knight for those who wish to be free of interplanetary imperialistic capitalism.  How this ultimately works, however (and what really makes &quot;Praxis&quot; different from its competitors), is left to our imaginations.  The corporate spy sent by Praxis to Mars in *Green Mars* goes native in a hurry and then simply becomes another &quot;good guy&quot; in the story.<br />The book is badly in need of editing.  There are loose ends everywhere--solid, stolid Nadia, for example, becomes Free Mars' first President, and then predictably begins to exhibit despotic tende! ncies.  Just asthis latest manifestation of the old adage ! that &quot;power corrupts&quot; begins to gather steam, however, that thread is dropped--forever.  And what DID ever happen to the quasi-mystical Hiroko?  Did Robinson forget to tell us, or are we simply supposed to intuit our own version of what her mysterious fate might be?<br />One of the strong points of *Red Mars* was its overall apparent credibility.  As one read the book, it really seemed that the various twists and turns in the plot were prophetic as to what might well happen if and when Mars is ever colonized.  In *Blue Mars*, however, things start going &quot;Buck Rogers.&quot; Consider this: in the future, humans will colonize Mercury by building an enclosed city that moves constantly on big railroad tracks around and around the planet to escape that world's temperature extremes.  Hmmmmm.  Other people will build cities for the near-weightless on the moons of Uranus, and still others will burrow into asteroids to create little mini-colonies that travel hither and yon. ! I also confess to finding it hard to believe that through scientific legerdemain Mars will (or can) be turned into a kind of mirror of earth, complete with genetically engineered polar bears and puffins.  By the end, the entire trajectory of the &quot;terraforming&quot; process strains reader credulity. Yeah, I guess I lack imagination.  On the other hand, even &quot;Star Trek&quot; never has gone to such extremes in its claims for future technological breakthroughs.<br />Overall, I recommend that readers buy and read *Red Mars*, and then skip the final two books of the trilogy.	1998-07-19
US	52841075	RYBOGHWSB1HHX	0553572393	710568866	Green Mars (Mars Trilogy)	Books	4	19	21	N	Y	The Martian saga gets bogged down in descriptive overkill	The first book in this trilogy, *Red Mars*, is a brilliant tale of interplanetary exploration and colonization, rife with human drama and supported by a plot that rings true as a very likely &quot;future history.&quot;  The sequel, however, is less satisfying.  After an enticing first hundred pages in which new characters, developments, and plot possibilities are introduced, the story bogs down and much of the middle portion of the book is devoted to ENDLESS &quot;description&quot; of what Mr. Robinson believes Mars might look like at particular stages of its future &quot;terraformed&quot; mutilation by human beings.  I applaud Robinson's desire to make the Martian landscapes real to the reader, but he should know that past a certain point, people become saturated with endless descriptions of physical terrain.  After reading page after page of these descriptions, my eyes finally began to glaze over.  The final portion of the book is much more satisfying, as the second part of the story, involving political intrigue and various clashes of personalities, comes to an exciting climax.   Robinson once again impresses in terms of his knowledge of the sciences and his ability to bring this knowledge to bear in his writing.  In fact, one of the key developments in the plot (those who have not read the book, avert your eyes here!)involves the catastropic melting of part of the Antarctic ice sheet, an eventuality that leads to rising sea levels of political upheaval worldwide.  This very possibility has recently received significant press coverage.  Kudos to Robinson for weaving future disaster scenarios that seem maximally plausible.  Overall, however, I think that the book could easily have been a hundred pages shorter without any loss of impact.	1998-07-08
US	52841075	R1SZ7HC9F52OT2	067945733X	699405656	Goodnight, Nebraska	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	The theme is hardly original, but this novel entertains.	Tom McNeal's first novel revisits thematic territory that has become all too familiar in American fiction in recent years: the twisted, melancholy, and sometimes desperate inner lives of small-town Americans.  Goodnight, Nebraska, where most of the book takes place, is portrayed as a kind of stereotypically stagnant rural community.  McNeal does, in fact, little to lend real geographical solidity to the novel beyond an occasional obligatory mention of cold winter weather or the nearby presence of the Sand Hills.  Moreover, the author sheds precious little light upon the internal motivations and essential character of the main protagonist, Randall Hunsacker, who comes across as sort of generically brooding and testosterone-driven, perhaps emblematic of &quot;American guyness&quot; ---but little else.  <br />Despite these weaknesses, however, *Goodnight, Nebraska* is one of those books I just couldn't wait to get back to after having put it down.  McNeal is a fine storyteller, and the manner in which he weaves individuals' fates together as part of a larger narrative is breathtaking.  I will add that McNeal's use of descriptive language is at times exceptional.  The book is a real page-turner and thoroughly entertaining. I recommend it.	1998-06-18
US	52841075	R14NAAZ25KAGDM	0060928360	99047112	Tales of Burning Love	Books	4	3	4	N	Y	Louise Erdrich has written her most commercial work to date.	Louise Erdrich is a masterful novelist, capable of writing spellbinding prose and developing complex, wonderfully human characters.  In *Tales of Burning Love*, all of these talents are apparent, and the novel is, if nothing else, a &quot;good read.&quot;  If some of her past works have tended toward a plodding pace and an ethereal kind of tone, this one is different in that it finds Ehrlich creating a veritable snowstorm of action and events.  In fact, there are so many bizarre twists and turns, so many eerie occurrences laden with ironies and sly twists of fate that one suspects that Erdrich may here be trying to broaden her audience so as to make her work more commercially successful.  It was this shift toward the tawdry, the sensational, and the lowest common denominator in terms of target audience that I found myself resenting by the end of the book.  <br />The male protagonist, Jack Mauser, has few or no redeeming qualities, as far as I can discern.  He's cruel, moody, unstable, and neither terribly bright nor sensitive.  Yet one of the principal premises of the book is that this man is veritably irresistible to a variety of women, four of whom he marries.  Perhaps this makes the book a &quot;woman's book,&quot; inasmuch as some female readers might find some point of identity with these women in the way that they just can't help loving this jerk, despite their better judgment.  But I found the whole swirl of affections and passions surrounding Jack Mauser annoying and unconvincing.<br />Even at her worst, Louise Erdrich is a terrific novelist, and this novel is well worth reading simply for the masterful way that Erdrich tells a story, makes transitions, and creates moods and visions.  But this is not her best novel.	1998-06-02
