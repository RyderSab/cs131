Candace Bushnell presses all the wrong buttons from the start of \\"Lipstick Jungle\\" -- impossibly glamorous and perfect heroines with fabulous careers being fabulous in fabulous settings. As any old Krantz/Steele hand knows, you've got to start with humble beginnings or these beyoches are completely unsympathetic to your average fat, unfabulous, cash-paying reader, like moi. Bushnell goes on to try to spice things up by stealing from Jackie Collins and Sidney Sheldon, but as someone who grew up with these titans of the trashy novel form, I wasn't buying it for a minute. She just doesn't have the chops and innate sympathy for her characters to pull it off. And what's with the ridiculous names? Stanford Blatch was bad enough, but Nico O'Neilly? Please, save your cash. Paging Carrie Bradshaw! <br />	2005-09-13

Haruki Murakami works his usual genius at creating characters with familiar and compelling conflicts, and effortlessly pulling the reader into the erotically charged setting of modern Japan. \\"Kafka\\" introduces some new elements in a focus on a rural landscape and some shocking and incomprehensible violence.

Just as well, because the reality of the place in the 21st century is pretty grim, as I experienced it. But the maddening habit of exiles to romanticize the place is well displayed in \\"Loving Che,\\" which hardly exists outside of lyrical scraps of random thought, sensation and writerly flights of fancy. Ana Menendez puts a lot of effort into conjuring up her dreamy reveries, but spends little time making her tale remotely believable or affecting. And the frequent pauses for \\"deep thoughts\\" get old very quickly. It's a lot like spending an afternoon talking about Cuba with an exile: captivating at times but more often just frustrating, opaque and sad.	2005-07-08

You can name names, point fingers and choose details with absolute freedom, because, after all, it's your story. Sean Wilsey takes full advantage of the memoir's license to ill by penning a nearly 500-page poison pen letter to his stepmother. He's an excellent writer and \\"Glory of It All\\" makes fascinating reading. But plowing through this book is like a long day roaming the streets of New York in August: You get dirtier and dirtier until you just can't stand it any more and have to take a shower. I'd never heard of most of the people Wilsey mentions, but by the end I couldn't help but feel sorry for them. Especially as Wilsey is very selective in his venom: His mother is an adorably kooky free spirit who just happens to marry rich, but her replacement is the personification of all evil--who may have even killed her own dog! He also conveniently comes up with extended, verbatim recollections of stepmonster's failings -- scenes and conversations recorded by a 10-year-old self who presumably has perfect recall and the psychological insight of the ages. In all, Wilsey is the literary equivalent of a skilled US Weekly quipster or an artistically minded paparrazo: Good at what he does, but damn sleazy.

I kept thinking that as I plodded through \\"Starter Wife,\\" pulled along by the witty dialogue and exotic/horrifying setting but disgusted by the main character. Gracie (does she really need a gay boyfriend named Will?) is a whiny, self-absorbed, zero of a character, who pitilessly judges everyone around her while falling into lockstep with the values she supposedly loathes. She sticks around with a jerk until he dumps her, then immediately starts shopping for Jerk No. 2. \\"Maneater\\" had a shallow, materialistic heroine as well, but dang, she was a lot of fun. Gracie is obsessed with her age to a point way beyond funny --  into the realm of the truly pathetic, and her character's insecurities seem to track uncomfortably close to the author's, judging by the recent NYT Mag article. Not half as fun as \\"Maneater,\\" and not half as insightful about Hollywood as anything by Bruce Wagner. Save your money and buy yourself some Botox instead. <br />	2005-05-24

Wener does a great job of creating believable, complex characters and a nicely quirky setting in downscale London.

These are unpleasant, haunted and pathological people, and it is Salter's genius that you not only want to spend time with these sociopaths, but want to take them home, hand them a few drinks and listen to them talk. Salter's gift is as adamantine as ever in \\"Last Night,\\" but unlike in his earlier classics like \\"Sport and a Pastime\\" and \\"Light Years,\\" the erotic edge has been dulled by age and regret. None of the stories has an obvious beginning, end or `dramatic arc,' and the collection is much more interesting for that.  Highly recommended for anyone who has stopped believing in happy endings.	2005-05-06

Despite the off-putting title, \\"Harmony Silk Factory\\" is one such gem, a very pleasant surprise that much outperforms the ritualistic pap that's come to dominate so much \\"Asian-American fiction.\\" Tash Aw is a truly gifted writer who manages to weave together fascinating tidbits of Malaysia's history and culture with the story of a screwed-up family. Best of all, he tells the story in the voice of a terrific, stereotype-busting character-a pedantic, vain and genuinely funny riff on a dutiful son, a kind of Tristram Shandy who finds himself in Southeast Asia. None of these all-wise, all-suffering stock characters who have come to dominate this psuedo-genre. Aw is a great talent, and I hope he finds the readers he deserves.

As someone who hates \\"The West Wing\\" and considers most political fiction deadly, I found McConnell's description of the White House and its intrigue fascinating and accessible. The ending falls a bit flat, especially after the writer has shown evidence of talent far beyond the typical thriller, but the book still holds up as a well-written, suspenseful and insightful read. I hope it finds some readers who can think outside the genre.	2005-04-28

With a sinking feeling, as parallel mounted on parallel, I realized that Krauss had basically recycled her husband Jonathan Safran Foer's most recent book, with a dash of his first book's shtetl magical realism thrown in. Perhaps this is some kind of postmodern stunt the two dreamed up, but I still felt cheated. Especially since the first section of the book, about an old man in New York and his relationship with his best friend, showed so much promise. Krauss brings the two men to life with vigor and humor and exhibits sparks of a talent in that section that eclipses her husband's arduous whimsy. Three stars for that alone. She never hits Foer's brilliant highs, but also never comes close to his mawkish lows. But since I just read \\"Extremely Loud\\" a few weeks ago, I was in no mood for Foer-style hijinks, and as soon as Krauss started hitting the familiar notes, I tuned out. Trust your instincts and your own unique talent next time, Nicole.   (Caveat emptor: if you see five-star reviews from people who've only written one review, that a sign that friends/family/agents are puffing up the book's ranking. This book is obviously the recipient of a powerful PR push.)	2005-04-24

The first big chunk of the book is spent with a woman who chooses to abandon her entire adult life to enable her mother's depression after her dad walks out. Perhaps it's a cultural thing, but I could not relate to this at all: She moves in with her \\"mam,\\" practically gives up on her job and lets mam decide how she spends her free time. What American woman would even consider such a codependent nightmare? The second character is supposed to be a brilliant, incredibly hot, wonderful human being who decides to work on destroying a family in her free time. I'm hardly a \\"Dr. Laura\\" zealot, but I found this character both unbelievable and repellent. Wake up, Marian, it's not 1958! These characters might have become more multidimensional in the hands of a better writer, but Keyes just doesn't have the chops. By the time we meet the third character (around page 200!), the book's second major flaw was really annoying me: namely, Keyes spends a hundred pages or so bringing you into a plot, then abruptly changes gears to introduce another character and story. They're all loosely related, but the effect is still jarring and disorienting. So I can't say much about Bachelorette Number Three, because at that point, I gave up, put the book down and moved on to something more meaningful. Recommended only for 1950s soap opera fans with attention deficit disorder.	2005-04-14

Libby is cute and flightly and resolutely superficial, even in the midst of a life crisis.

Bruce Wagner can make this work by both using pop culture and mocking it, but David Schickler seems to content himself with aping what's around him and forcing it between covers. Only the faintest shadow of the slight charms of \\"Kissing in Manhattan\\" remains in \\"Sweet and Vicious,\\" which starts with a blatant ripoff of the most famous scenes of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and slides downhill from there. Schickler's whimsy doesn't do well outside of Manhattan, it seems, and his portrayal of the small-town Midwest makes me wonder if he's ever set foot outside the five boroughs. Although the novel is well written and fitfully interesting, it never recovered from its trip to Tarantino-land. Leave the tough guys to Elmore Leonard and the heartland to Sinclair Lewis, Mr. Schickler. Stick with the place, and themes, that you do best.	2005-04-09

Unfortunately, however, Green has failed to create a likeable foil for the \\"Monster-in-Law.\\" Ellie comes off as materialistic, selfish and superficial, and you can't help but wishing her long-suffering hubby would wise up and move on. The ending is also a bit melodramatic and strikes a false note. But Green does chick lit proud with generally good writing and a tight plot. I'll be seeking out her other books.	2005-04-09

His stroke of genius is the invention in his alternate world of the daemon: a shape-changing familiar that embodies some of a person's soul. It's a great concept, and Pullman explores it with great sensitivity and real skill. Every sentence of \\"Golden Compass\\" is polished to a high sheen, and the plotting and inspired creations like armored bears and Gyptians vault this book into the first rank. It only falters when Pullman pulls out his hobbyhorse: a deep dislike for \\"the Church.\\" This weird anti-clericalism seems jarringly out of place in a work of fantasy, and strangely out of date in its positing of an all-powerful religious bureaucracy working against scientific progress. But when \\"Compass\\" isn't straying into \\"DaVinci Code\\"-style paranoia, it's one of the best books of any genre out there.	2005-04-09

However, as several reviewers have pointed out, Oskar Schell is much more problematic character than anyone in \\"Illuminated.\\" If I hadn't met several Buckley/Dalton boys and their Upper West/East Side ilk, I would have found him downright jarring intrusion into what is supposed to be a contemporary setting linked to an event fresh in the minds of New Yorkers. Believe it or not, kids like this do exist in New York, but that knowledge didn't make Oskar any less annoying, until his too-cute persona started showing some cracks. Midway through, he really started to grow on me and and Foer's talent started working its magic. That said, I found myself wondering if in fact it is too soon for this kind of 9/11 novel. Foer's sincerity seems too treacly and similar to tabloid \\"hero\\" headlines for my tastes--I found myself wishing for a Jerzy Kosinski or Italo Svevo to take on this most monstrous yet hyper-sentimentalized event of our times. Even so, Foer is an outstanding writer and this book is well worth a read.	2005-04-04

Ishiguro's books are like ice sculptures--awe-inspiring in their mastery and technique but never quite present in all their dimensions. Unlike \\"Remains of the Day,\\" \\"Orphans\\" gets you somewhat emotionally involved with the main character, and invokes a kind of grief at his losses and loneliness. However, Ishiguro seems to lose confidence in his creation toward the end and indulges in some theatrics that dispel the fragile magic. But Ishiguro's sheer mastery of mood and atmosphere -- and the exotic but not exoticized setting -- make \\"Orphans\\" well worth reading.	2005-04-04

I had to pick it up because I'm an Austen fan, but Karen Joy Fowler's attempt to pay homage to Austen's style is to create a panoply of flat, flavorless characters with twee names who make cutesy observations about life. Her idea of creating atmosphere is to throw in a comment about the heat every other page or so--other than that the book could be set in Siberia for all the care she takes with description. Instead of recognizable human beings as characters, she substitutes writing-workshop pastiches of quirky mannerisms and pseudo-dialogue. Worst of all are the endless paens to noble dogs--on some level the novel is a book-length issue of \\"Dog Fancy\\" magazine. Gee, do you think most Austen fans are cat people or dog people? Duh. The only good thing about it is that it may turn some readers on to the original novels, summarized here with all the depth and insight of ... an Amazon.com reader's review! <br />In all, Jane would not approve.	2005-03-25

The first few pages didn't help either, full of relentless wordplay and pop culture trivia-why read something like this when I can watch \\"The Simpsons\\"? But somewhere around page 5, Wagner reached out from between the lines and absolutely grabbed me. He's some kind of genius-in only a few paragraphs he can sketch a character, weave him into a plot and weave the plot into a brutal critique of modern life, all while making you laugh and really feel for his creations. The pop culture patter updates some very serious and classic themes of family and friendship, yet he can let go with incredible bits like \\"a controversial, all-white version of 'A Raisin in the Sun.'\\" He's as close as I've seen to a modern-day Dickens, and \\"Chrysanthemum Palace\\" is as good a book as I've read in...weeks.

You just don't want to spend time around this annoying little girl. But stick with this book through to the shattering finish--it's worth it. McEwan has genuine gift for plot and atmosphere: This book combines the best elements of a period tragedy with a tight, suspenseful mystery. Scenes set in WW2 are horrifically real and moving in the best sense. And he wraps the book up in finish both shocking and satisfying, an indictment of both childish sins and the act of writing itself.

What a tragedy if this world of passionate, intensely curious and challenging intellectuals is gone forever. But judging by some of the \\"next big thing\\" writers I've been reading lately, that may be the case. No one even comes close to Bellow's ability to amuse, educate and inspire without breaking a sweat, except Philip Roth, of course. The twilight of the gods may be upon us. This is a fantastic book, engrossing to the last line and far too much to take in on a single reading. Although it's about old men and their memories, it has more to say about life than a thousand of these crappy memoirs and \\"coming of age at Iowa Writers Workshop\\" excrescences that have been afflicting readers lately. After reading \\"Ravelstein,\\" I started checking jobs and rents in Chicago. Even if the world of this novel is only a shadow of its former self, that would be enough for me.	2005-03-01

But once again Jared Diamond has taken a complex and potentially agenda-driven subject and made it into a sparkling, fascinating read. The series of societal collapses that Diamond looks at here are never simplistic \\"those nasty humans screwed it all up\\" stories. The complex interaction of culture, climate and geography makes for absorbing reading, and Diamond has a real gift for telling detail--who would have thought that the kayak was such a triumph of engineering? This book is like a lifetime's worth of trips to exotic destinations and epochs in one volume. And Diamond never strains to make a point about every case--he can make you empathize with a Medieval Norse settler in one chapter and a Montana rancher in the next. Diamond is simply one of the best nonfiction writers working today, and you owe yourself a look at this book.	2005-02-24

Yikes, what if \\"Codex\\" falls into the hands of innocent children? <br /> <br />Seriously, this warmed-over Dan Brown wouldn't be worth a look if it weren't for Lev Grossman's obvious talent. Unlike the clowns who hacked out \\"Rule of Four,\\" Grossman can actually write. Ironically, \\"Codex\\" only comes alive when the action stops--there's a great coming-of-age novel in here that some clueless agent/editor destroyed by trying to hitch a ride on the \\"DaVinci Code\\" gravy train. <br /> <br />I was losing patience after about the 10th \\"action\\" scene set in the stacks, then almost gave up after a big climax set in -- you guessed it-- another freaking library! Dude, even Sterling after closing time wasn't that exciting. Another misstep is a silly subplot about a computer game: Writing about computer games is like talking about onanism--it's a lot more fun (and easier) to do than describe. I was also a little grossed out by Grossman's obsession with the heroine's clearly prepubescent physique. <br /> <br />But I truly hope Grossman gets a new agent and writes the great novel that he's capable of at some point.

She's also got a real gift for allowing the reader into someone's head and making situations spring to life. But the strain of trying to keep up with half a dozen women and their many partners and children keeps bringing the narrative to a screeching halt. For women's fiction, this is a long book, but even in the final few pages I still had to struggle to connect the dots. Which was the divorced one? Was it the happily married one with the twins, or the one with the cheater? Whose husband was who? The editors also make no effort to make the minor changes that would make the book more accessible to American readers: Why did the the women keep putting their babies into cots--were they camping?

Eliot references into dialogue so bad it gives Michael Crichton a run for his money. Not entertaining, not sexy, not fun. Stop insulting your readers, Ms. Messina, and give this genre its due. If not, try your hand at \\"real\\" literature and watch the rejections start rolling in.	2005-02-09

After skunking up my house by boiling up leeks and skunking up my breath by actually eating them, I've got to give Mireille Guiliano some credit. She's made a mint selling a lifestyle which really only works in one place--France! Her next project should be selling the Brooklyn Bridge. We don't have lavish outdoor markets here to pick fresh produce, and we don't have lavishly short workdays so that we can be home spending two hours chopping, cleaning and then boiling up vegetables that would be more logically fed to swine. There's no secret to French thinness: Anyone who's actually spent any time in France knows one thing: They're midgets! France is full of people with genes for being short and thin--perhaps it helped them dodge the guillotine. A few hour's drive and you're in Germany, where millions of us have roots, and what do you see: Big, tall, beefy -- fat people. That said, Guiliano's a good writer, and we could all stand to eat more veggies and less Olive Garden swill. But instead of buying this book, you'd be better off saving up for a ticket to Paris instead.	2005-02-09

Perrotta is dead-on in capturing 30-something anomie and delusions of suburban life, and he's skilled at creating a plot that's compelling and just this side of outlandish. But the novel was gone from my mind as soon as the last page was turned--recent chick flick \\"The Wedding Date\\" was more thought-provoking. It's a good read, but basically an empty shell. Oh well, what do you expect from a puppet show?	2005-02-09

And the constant '80s references get tiring about 10 pages in--even for those of us who were there. Yes, there was lots of silly music and bad hair, but who needs to hear about it every other paragraph? Markham does best with plotting and a depiction of suburban motherhood that really rings true. And I really didn't know which Mike our gal would end up with. Not bad Wendy, just lose the gimmicks and romance-novel heroine next time.	2005-01-27

Semple's not a bad writer and her sex scenes are quite spicy, but the novel will stay with you only as long as it takes to close the book and put it back on a shelf. None of the characters is remotely believable or likeable, and a bizarre domestic violence interlude just leaves you queasy. \\"Ex Factor\\" would be better described, perhaps, as the Yoshinoya of Japanese food--cheap, greasy and a bit stomach-turning.	2005-01-27

Like \\"Bangkok 8\\" it's a fascinating look at a dynamic and rapidly changing nation, but \\"Sightseeing\\" also suffers from the writer's inexperience. The stories are a bit repetitive and seem to have an unhealthy obsession with mother figures, typical of unpolished collections from young writers. But despite the flaws, \\"Sightseeing\\" is definitely worth buying for a look at a country we unfortunately hear little about except when disaster strikes.	2005-01-01

You buy a Crichton for an entertaining, quick read, and this one delivers. So what if there's some propaganda in there? Read any Barbara Kingsolver lately? At least Crichton doesn't indulge in the treacly self-congratulation of leftist novelists. At least there's no sharing, no rapturous discovery of the moral superiority of people of color, and no orgasmic vision quests. He also has the guts to lay his ideas out there at the end instead of trying to force everything into the mouths of his characters. Face it, Crichton's characters are always two-dimensional mouthpieces for something, it's just that there aren't any dinosaurs around to claim that they were misrepresented in \\"Lost World.\\" Get over yourselves, people.

Just as I'm unlikely to invite the UPS man into my boudoir, I'm also unlikely to have fistfuls of fresh herbs and exotic spices lying around my kitchen. I was all excited about a lamb recipe in \\"Feast\\"--until Nigella started talking about what I should tell my butcher about preparing the meat. My butcher? The only butcher shops in my neighborhood are scary places with whole sheep in the windows. And a \\"homemade granola\\" recipe called for brown rice syrup, an item likely to set me back five bucks or so at the health food store. So much for saving money on making my own granola! That said, the book is gorgeous and Nigella is fun to spend time with, as usual. \\"Feast\\" is more for the nightstand than the kitchen, but it's still worth having.	2004-12-12

Sugar and her adventures are more the like the mildly [...] fantasies of a Dickens fan, without any of the master's wit, humanity or plotting genius. I'm not a Victorian prostitute, but I am a woman, and no woman thinks like Sugar, nor do her actions make any sense within the context of the time or place. Faber does have a gift for detail and the dirty bits are done well, but this book is a tough slog as the improbabilities and melodrama pile up.

Another 30 pages on my enthusiasm was flagging, and soon I could barely compel myself to finish the thing. Mitchell's prose is sparkling and his ambition is refreshing, but this is a superficial and deeply chilly book. Like David Foster Wallace and other young hipsters, Mitchell seems to think it's enough to show off verbal pyrotechnics in his work without bothering to create characters you can actually care about or events that are remotely believable. And it's not modern Tokyo-an admittedly chilly and artificial place-that is at fault, as writers like Haruki Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto manage to create a Tokyo as engaging and involving as Proulx's Wyoming or Davies' rural Canada. If you're interested in brilliant wordplay, you'd be better off reading Jonathan Safran Foer. If you're interested in modern Tokyo, read \\"Windup Bird Chronicle\\" or anything by Haruki or Ryu Murakami, but stay away from Mitchell.

Abu-Jaber has a great, lyrical touch in relating a tale of her family's peregrinations and trials as her mother adjusts to a stint in Jordan and her father adjusts to living in the U.S. She also does a great job incorporating the recipes in the narrative.

John D. MacDonald dives into the country's culture and landscape in \\"Cinnamon Skin\\" with his patented combination of cynicism, idealism, lechery and expertly rendered action, and you'll be really glad you came along for the ride. <br /> <br />\\"Cinnamon\\" is one of the later books in the series, and finds Travis and Meyer a little the worse for wear, time and loss having taken a toll. Travis starts the book by losing yet another good woman, and Meyer's still traumatized by events in the book before. That's what makes this series so great--the author's willingness to bring us along as his characters age, suffer and make mistakes. <br /> <br />I'm a younger, female reader, but have yet to find any mystery writer working today who even comes close to MacDonald. Basically, when I need a mystery fix, I'm more likely to re-read one of these than bother with the hacks that clutter the best-seller lists. Warm thanks to the publishers who brought out these spiffy new editions--even though a big part of the fun of discovering MacDonald is stumbling across the tattered original paperbacks with 1970s reciepts used as bookmarks and \\"Valley of the Dolls\\"-like babes on the covers. <br />Enjoy, and don't waste any more time on the inferior imitations!	2004-11-23

In the novel the Roth family is subjected to a series of ever-more-restrictive policies designed to help them \\"assimiliate\\"--an eerie echo of the anti-gay and xenophobic rhetoric that has shadowed this election and seems to have determined its outcome. Although the political exposition can get a bit eye-glazing at times, Roth is brilliant at viewing that nation's drift toward fascism from a child's perpective: What is most frightening to young Philip is the effect of Lindbergh's policies on relationships within his own family and his insular little world. And like all of Roth's characters, Philip is brought to life by a wonderful pastiche of flaws, encounters and idiosyncratic passions.	2004-11-05

Unfortunately, this great topic is undermined by the author's insistence on making her family part of the story-literally dragging her hubby, 3-year-old and infant along on an endless trek around the continent in an RV. Chunks of linguistic and historical analysis are woven into sagas of the kids' toilet habits and feeding schedules. Who cares what her daughter likes and doesn't like about the landscape of Finland, especially when the child comes off as a singularly whiny brat? The mix doesn't work at all, but the book's worth sticking with if you skip over the \\"what my cute kid said/ate/excreted today\\" interludes.

But hoping for a quick fix, I picked it up anyway, and an hour later, was even more embarrassed. This slim collection of flimsy anecdotes, Cosmo-like quizzes and snarky quips is pretty painless to get through, but won't tell you anything you don't already know unless you're fresh out of a convent or have the self-esteem of a sea slug. And knowing how much my fellow single women were willing to put up with to have male company was just plain depressing. The book did serve a very useful purpose in the end, however. It is the last 'relationship' book I will ever buy. The fact is that there is no white knight out there for a lot of us, and we just have to get over it and get on with life. I put this book down, mailed in that long-delayed donation to the food bank and called to volunteer in city schools later that day.

P.D. James's strange obsession with doing violence to professional women reaches a low point in this book, with yet another caricatured, manipulative, nymphomaniac career gal who meets a much-deserved end. James doesn't even try to make Venetia Aldridge believable or bring the setting to life, she just tries to stoke the reader's hatred of Venetia to the point that her death is practically a good deed. And she's a bad mother, too! Not that the setting of a fancy London law firm is particularly compelling - an American reader will find it almost impossible to figure out what's going on at many points thanks to a blizzard of British legal jargon and traditions that are never explained. Several key plot points don't make much sense if you've never sat through a British trial. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this book. <br />	2004-10-15

There's lots of interesting meditation on hypocrisy and faith, and Dalgliesh even gets a love interest, although some glaciers move faster than this romance. James is at her strongest writing about powerful men and their foibles and odd backwaters of British culture. Doesn't get much better than this for an absorbing and powerful read.	2004-10-15

Was I wrong! Jonathan Lethem does a great job creating a fascinating character in Lionel Essrog, and he has a real talent for plot and pacing as well. But the best part of the book are Lionel's riffs on language, prompted by Tourette's syndrome and often erupting from him at the worst times. It never feels exploitative (unlike parts of \\"Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time\\") and Lionel's character remains complex and his actions unpredictable in a good way. Great book by an inspired writer whose work I'll start seeking out in earnest.	2004-09-11

I'm just sorry it had to end. A great mix of wit, storytelling and some geninuely magical writing.  <br /> <br />Sure, it's a bit slow in parts and any kind of military exploit is tough going for this reader. But every time I let myself be lulled to less than full attention, Clarke brought me back with something extraordinary, like the episode in Venice with the decayed socialite who in her old age can speak only cat or the ships made out of rain. <br /> <br />And don't neglect the footnotes despite their tiny typeface--there's a poem about the Raven King in a note early on that ranks among the most moving and lyrical pieces of writing I've encountered in years. A real masterpiece--I'm just sorry I can't read it for the first time again.	2004-09-06

It mostly works and kept me turning pages until the characters' motivations unraveled and the sanctimony around Rina's cleanup of a descrated synagogue got too excessive. A nastily misogynistic portrait of a young femme fatale also had me wondering about Faye's own mental health. Must women be either trollops or sainted orthodox housewives in her world?

The one-dimensional quality of Rina (do we know much about her other than her hair is ebony and her eyes are blue?) in previous Decker novels should have warned me, but I laid out the bucks for \\"Street Dreams\\" anyway and had to force myself to finish it. Cindy's every action and scrap of dialogue is patently unbelieveable and forced--she's like Pete Decker in drag without the religious convictions that make him interesting. The boyfriend comes off as some kind of politically correct composite culled from a Frum Harlequin romance. The plot never comes together either, despite a nice twist toward the end. Do yourself a favor if you're in the mood for a mystery starring a woman, read Sara Paretsky or Sue Grafton instead.	2004-08-17

The lake and the Idaho community this book is set in come to life as a kind of timeless archetype of the Far West, complete with climate calamities, sudden violence and extreme isolation.

Don't get me wrong: there's some nice writing, intriguing plot twists and engaging psychological complexity in this book. Just stop reading before Schnur takes some very bad advice and wraps up the plot in an artificial and wildly unbelievable conclusion. If only she'd kept it simple and let the story end as life often does--without a neat, prepackaged happy ending.	2004-07-26

The first chapters set in a devastated and demon-haunted Ireland are beautifully written and compelling. But Cormac's adventures in the New World take on a high school history class slideshow-like quality as the novel skips from period to period. And as much as I admire Hamill's multiculturalism, by about the fourth dusky femme fatale that Cormac conquers it started to curdle into a kind of condescending exoticism. Hamill can still write the pants off most authors out there, however, and glimpses of some lesser-known periods of New York history are fascinating. Altogether well worth a look.	2004-07-18

At least Dan Brown has the mechanics of a thriller down: the striplings behind &quot;Rule of Four&quot; are rank amateurs. Brown at least keeps the writing simple: The prose in &quot;Rule&quot; is clotted with complicated syntax, choking on exposition and littered with silly pronouncements. The book's &quot;wisdom&quot; is especially laughable: The philosophical spoutings of Ivy League seniors are unbearably pompous even to other Ivy League seniors--why would the authors think grownups would take them seriously? The dialogue and plotting is farcical and would be hooted out of a writer's workshop. The publishing establishment has done these boyz and readers everywhere a great disservice by pumping up &quot;Rule&quot; as a literate successor to &quot;DaVinci&quot; -- don't try to sell us warmed-over Olive Garden fare when we're in the mood for a Big Mac.	2004-07-17

The daily drudgery of motherhood and married life for even a gorgeous gal married to a perfect man is a nice corrective to all the puffery about &quot;having it all&quot; out there, without ranging too far into nightmarish Kate Reddy territory. Not especially well written or plotted, but readable, fun and engaging.	2004-07-16

The woodcuts add brilliantly to the atmosphere, at their most effective at their simplest: slashes of white or shadows with no faces. Garland's ability to put the reader inside another's conciousness is reminiscent of masters like Dostoevsky. Please, purge your mind of the vision of Leo DiCaprio in warpaint and get this book.	2004-07-16

Agatson goes on and on about the magic of carb-cutting as if it's a great trick that will have minimal impact on your eating habits--then lays out a diet that is classic calorie cutting and portion-size restriction. But I give him lots of credit for the recipes, which have become part of my repertoire regardless of dieting. Great salads and dressings, especially. Recommended if you can let go of the hype and accept that to lose weight, you need to better and eat less.	2004-07-11

The trio of Spenser, Hawk and Susan is so overly familar at this point that a different kind of mutt would have been most welcome. And sad to say, Parker can't be bothered to pause in his encomiums to Susan's perfection and Lucky Magazine-like riffs on Hawk's natty duds to make any attempt to develop the characters in this outing. Credulity is a bit strained as well--five bloody shooting deaths in a week and no heat on Spenser? Come on. <BR>Dialogue is still crisp and settings are vivid, however, so even second-rate Parker is a cut above most of the stuff out there.	2004-07-10

Relentlessly superficial with a strangely brittle quality, this novel promises bubbly fun, but delivers little but endless brand names, forced zaniness and a plot twist that's given away in the jacket copy. And for a book about carefree rich people, a queasy anxiety about money seems to pervade every encounter in the novel. Thanks, but I have enough money stress in my life to want to deal with it inexpertly rendered in fiction. Leave writing to the professionals, Ms. Sykes, and market your consumerist boy-craziness to Cosmo if you feel you must express yourself in print again.	2004-07-10

Parkhurst makes little effort to make her characters realistic or ground this novel in a sense of place, but her expert plotting and pacing had me burning through pages. She also crafts an idealized and poignant love affair that captures the imagination yet seems doomed from the very first. A parallel plot on teaching dogs to talk adds to the dreamlike and moving atmosphere. Recommended as a speedy and deftly written summer read.	2004-07-02

Unlike many modern novels, &quot;Dressler&quot; is at its most interesting when describing Martin's business dealings and the workings and secrets of his palace-like hotels. The unconvincing love affairs don't seem to hold Millhauser's attention, and it feels like he abandons them in exasperation at a certain point. The energy of the novel runs out of steam in tandem with Martin's empire, but I found myself wanting much more. Perhaps Millhauser can take a longer sabbatical next time and create the epic he was born to write.	2004-07-02

By taking such an elegiac and despairing tone, Elizabeth Seay manages to depress the reader without conveying much of the beauty and complexity of Native American language and culture. Her quest, as exemplified by the title, is to find something lost?large communities of people speaking Native American languages in Oklahoma. Very early in the book the reader is told this is a near-hopeless task, and the tone of the book takes a fatal downward plunge. Her extensive reporting and research are apparent, but I struggled to motivate myself to keep reading. Why not celebrate the language communities that do exist, even if you have to leave Oklahoma? That said, this book did beautifully describe a part of the country that few go out of their way to visit, and Seay made a convincing case for Oklahoma as an underappreciated landscape with a fascinating history and mix of people. Overall, well done but a major downer.	2004-04-27

But Lynne Truss quickly won me over with her charming blend of passion, humor and trivia. (Did you know the first Russian Revolution was sparked by printers angry over punctuation?) Everyone can learn from Truss's clear and common-sense explanation of punctuation marks and their usage, and her occasional lapses into wild-eyed orthodoxy are quickly forgiven. Only one major cavil: Truss seems to think the New Yorker is a model for American punctuation and usage. That's like using &quot;Brideshead Revisted&quot; as a primer on modern British life! It also seems strange that the publishers, in taking our American dollars, couldn't make the minor modifications necessary to conform to U.S. punctuation standards. But this is a very entertaining and informative book nonetheless, highly recommended to any reader.	2004-04-26

Judging by the reviews, a lot of readers are uncomfortable with something that they can't really pin down. Dyer doesn't help these readers out by flitting around the globe and resolutely refusing to say anything meaningful about anything but his own state of mind. But once you let go of expectations, \\"Yoga\\" really starts to grow on you, adding up to a pleasant if transitory experience, kind of like an evening with an aging backpacker in a seedy hostel with a bottle of Thai whiskey. Dyer also charms as someone who is obviously staggeringly well-read, yet wears his knowledge lightly and seems to actually live with his favorites, instead of just name-drop. That must be a British thing, because it's rare to find American writers who can pull this off. (...)	2004-04-26

That's a question that kept coming up as I read \\"Jennifer Government.\\" This book takes globalization and pushes just a little into the future, where the U.S. has literally bought out big chunks of the world and people's last names are their same as the company they work for. I had high hopes as I started this book, and Max Barry's smooth and vivid writing style kept me optimistic. What's missing, however, is what drives the best satire-righteous anger. Barry can't seem to summon much rage either within or directed toward his brave new world, just a sort of world-weary cynicism. His lack of commitment failed to keep this reader engaged, and I found myself skipping through big chunks of the novel. Tons of characters with similar names and thin characterizations didn't help. So although &quot;Jennifer Government&quot; is entertaining, I'm still waiting for the great anti-globalization novel.	2004-04-25
US	43996206	R1SL5OL7CAZJHU	0446670251	437057713	The Virgin Suicides	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Much better than Middlesex	Eugenides works magic with tone and perspective in this novel, but don't be scared off by the high-minded accolades. \\"Virgin Suicides\\" is suspenseful, well-written and supremely entertaining, and you'll be hard-pressed to put it down. Perhaps the author's supreme achievement is evoking a childhood in the suburbs in the 1970s: you'll swear you can see the technicolor and smell the polyester. Transplanted into this setting are the Lisbon sisters, who seem both out of place and out of time. The reader never quite gets what's going on with the sisters, but that's the point, and Eugenides beautifully manages to tell the story without giving away too much. If you enjoyed this book, try Stephen Millhouser's \\"Knife Thrower\\" for a similar spooky and detached tone with even more outlandish goings-on.	2004-04-24

(This reader is not a huge fan of the short-story form, but I make an exception for Millhauser and other modern masters like Stuart Dybek.) Millhauser's genius in \\"Knife Thrower\\" is his narrator's voice-a spooky, spectral \\"we\\" who seems to be both watching the bizarre spectacle below and a part of it. After a few stories, the reader becomes part of the \\"we,\\" and is transported into a very strange world. It's like mainlining Frank Baum or C.S. Lewis: you start feeling like a visitor on your own planet. The atmosphere of these stories is addictive and entrancing, and it almost hurt to come to the end of this collection. Try Jeffrey Eugenides \\"Virgin Suicides\\" for another successful variation on this theme.	2004-04-24

On the plus side, Kellerman's writing is as always a cut above the usual and he has good control over detail and pacing. Unfortunately, the women in this book make even stick figures like Robin seem complex. The scenes in the conspiracy club are  cartoonish and about as menacing as an afternoon in a nursing home rec room. Bring back Alex and his rich boy, can't commit melodramas!

Bourdain is not only a fascinating character, he is also one hell of a writer, and maintains a delicate balance between outrage and outrageousness at all times. He's one of my favorite writers, period, and I've never paid more than $50 for a meal in my life. Not that Bourdain doesn't write expertly about food and especially the emotional and sensual joys of eating-he's among top modern food writers like Ruth Reichl and Jonathan Reynolds in combining expertise and literary skill. But unlike many upper-crusty food journalists, he also gets into the polyglot and hedonistic culture of the kitchen, an often hysterical portrayal that rings true to this former dishwasher. If you've ever spent time in a restaurant in any capacity, you owe yourself this book.	2004-04-16

Much less regale the reader with his various temper tantrums, drunken escapades and intestinal woes for more than 300 pages and still come out smelling like a rose.  Bourdain only gets better in \\"A Cook's Tour,\\" a book whose limp title hardly reflects the bacchanalian revels within. The highlights in this book are often Bourdain's lowlights, his frequent bouts of melancholy and fits of pique against the indignities imposed by the TV crew trailing him around the word. And no one writing today has captured the sleazy half-life of expats in third-world Asia better than Bourdain in a few brilliant paragraphs on Phnom Penh. Travelers, food fans, fans of great writing, you'll treasure this book.	2004-04-16

McLaughlin and Kraus manage to write some nuance into characters like Mrs. X and her cohort and are skilled at weaving details into the story without sound like Judith Krantz-esque label-droppers. Women like Mrs. X have made their deals with the devil, but the authors never completely let go of compassion for the women and their charges. The husbands in the story are little more than shadows, which is perhaps the point. It would be nice to think that the authors are exaggerating, but judging from New York Magazine, no exaggeration is required to reflect the materialism, superficiality and reactionary values of this subculture. Scary!	2004-04-14

Slang uses of words like &quot;weird&quot; and bitchy&quot; sprinkled over the first dozen or so pages also rang false, as per other reviews. But Shorto's enthusiasm, humility and the intrinsic originality of &quot;Island's&quot; thesis eventually won me over. I would have liked to have read more about daily life in the colony and heard a bit less about prostitutes (have a good time researching in Amsterdam, Mr. Shorto?), but in all this is a worthy and enjoyable book. The author makes a strong case for the lasting impact of the Dutch legacy of diversity and religious toleration on American society, and the roots of that legacy in Dutch and European history. Judging by the recent brouhahas over Janet Jackson and Howard Stern, however, it may be too soon to downgrade Puritan legacies like prurience and hypocrisy as cultural mainsprings.  Overall, a well-written and interesting work.	2004-04-13

The endless hassles and humiliations that make up Kate Reddy's days juggling high-powered career, kids and husband gave me a case of heartburn and elevated blood pressure just from turning the pages. Pearson's zany plot twists verge on sadism, even if the character's decision to sell her soul so completely for cash renders her unsympathetic from the start.  For a certain tiny, VERY privileged slice of society, the horrors of Kate's life may approach reality. But, like hemorrhoids or cockroach mating habits, are such mundane yet unpleasant subjects worth reading about if they're not rendered by a master? This is only middling work, and I can't imagine a harried mother would want to spend her free time reliving the worst moments of her life. Quick, someone, tie my tubes!	2004-04-08

I was hoping for more description of the inter-war years and psychological insight into Dalgliesh, but he becomes more like a chick-lit \\"white knight\\" in every book. James can't seem to get beyond his devotion for the annoyingly perfect Emma to involve him in any depth in the actual mystery. And some of the plot twists were laughable excursions into '70s style \\"decadence.\\" Please, I appreciate James' reluctance to indulge in modern serial killer butchery, but orgies just don't cut it as a \\"horrible secret\\" any more.

In \\"Blood Doctor,\\" the reader spends a lot more time in the head of fatuous, middle-aged member of Parliament Martin Nanther than in any state of suspense. That comes as a bit of a letdown considering the book's title and salacious jacket copy. But Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell is hardly your typical hack-n-slash mystery writer, and for long stretches, it's worth sticking around for the ride. Several hundred pages in, however, the fact that both main characters are basically unsympathetic starts to erode what pleasure there is in Vine's writing and powers of observation. And this American reader is hardly fascinated with the intricacies of the House of Lords and the petty snobberies of Britian's class-obsessed multitudes. The mystery at the center also comes out as unsavory rather than horrifying. But I'll certainly pick up another Vine/Rendell book, just to get a glimpse of the author's idiosyncratic and skillfully rendered obsessions.	2004-04-07

But with an early scene of Flashman slapping around his girlfriend and then playing a cruel trick on a fellow officer, my enthusiasm waned. Things just got worse with more beatings of women, lots of racist ranting and some unconvincing swashbuckling. Fraser seems to find humor in thuggery and charm in crude brutality. Harry's just not an appealing character, and the \\"historical detail\\" is not worth having to put up with him. And as this was written in 1969, the lavish use of the n-word seems a particularly interesting choice. (As I am also a big fan of Chuck Palahniuk, Outkast and Adam Sandler, you can't dismiss me as some kind of PC prude.) The rousing adventure is usually of the \\"farmer's daughter\\" type and the settings doesn't come to life. Why would I read another book about a nasty frat boy when it just really isn't any fun? Try T.E. Lawrence (\\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\") or Robert Byron (\\"Road to Oxiana\\") if you want genuinely amusing Brit characters in exotic locales.	2004-04-06

Perhaps the answer to that question would make for a compelling sequel to this book. But admirably Applebaum keeps a very tight rein on the ideological battles that rage in Russian studies (see other reviews!) and sticks to the facts-many of which a nonspecialist would have no access to in such detail before this book. As a child who was lucky enough to encounter \\"The Endless Steppe\\" at an impressionable age, I was grateful to find such a nonpolemical and graceful introduction to this topic.  This book is comprehensive and well structured, and free of the jargon and awkward writing that afflicts many histories. Applebaum also allows for some lyricism when writing about the landscapes of the Russian Far East and the doomed romances between prisoners-although she usually lets the facts and the prisoners' own words speak for themselves. Don't be put off by the grim cover and daunting heft of this book: it's a great read.	2004-04-05

Florence is an aging \\"Sex and the City\\" tart supposedly based on Lily Bart of \\"House of Mirth.\\" But Wharton understands that a reader needs to identify with something in a character--Lily's quixotic idealism keeps you rooting for her all the way down. Although her writing is above average and her observations are acute, Tama Janowitz gives you nothing except increasing contempt for Florence as she throws away the advantages of modern American life to wallow in addiction and degradation. It seems to be a poison pen letter from an aging \\"it girl\\" whose time has passed to all the women she has envied over the years or her husband has admired. Yuck. Stay away.	2004-04-04

Struck by his work for the New York Press, I finally found this book secondhand and it's a classic! Ames has a very distinctive and winning voice and his New York is a perfect balance of charm, chaos and perversion. Unfortunately, Ames tends to recycle the best bits in his work, but what incredible bits! His great aunt should be bronzed and put in Central Park as an unforgettable New York character.

As a fan of \\"Virgin Suicides\\" and a resident of a remote outpost of the \\"hair belt\\" -- a Greek-American neighborhood -- I was particularly interested in checking out \\"Middlesex.\\" However, the originality and admirable concision of \\"Suicides\\" deserts Eugenides in his latest novel. Not that there aren't great things about \\"Middlesex\\": It is  another intimate and loving look at Detroit, a city, like Pittsburgh, that hardly gets its due in U.S. literature. But Eugenides tends to noodle when he could sketch something in a few strokes, and he has absolutely no sense of humor. And for a book about hermaphrodites and illicit love, there is little in the way of believable passion or lust. Sadly, writers like Eugenides, Franzen and Chabon seem to think that writing long, painterly, rather pedestrian stories will place them in the pantheon. I hope they're wrong.	2004-04-04

Underwhelmed by a slew of lukewarm offerings from hot young authors, I waited to get this novel until it was in paperback and discounted before succumbing to the hype. Foer practically had me at \\"Chapter 1.\\" This author not only writes beautifully--he's also very funny. Why are so many young literary lions afraid to crack a joke? Not that \\"Everything\\" doesn't also move you to tears at times and bring home the horrific reality of the Holocaust in \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" country. The whimsy does start to pall toward the end, however, as the character of Brod takes center stage. She's a bit too perfect, and the Chagall-esque phantasmagoria that Foer has so carefully created starts verging on \\"Mulan\\" melodrama. The ending was also somewhat muddled, but I can't wait to read this book again.	2004-04-04

The Dan Brown of \\"Angels\\" is a far better writer that the hack who ground out &quot;DaVinci Code,&quot; making me wonder if the real author got a little close to the conspiracy. . .Seriously, \\"Angels\\" is a fun read, and actually goes into some depth about Vatican history, Italian art and the tourist traps of Rome. The plot takes some nice twists, and pops some genuine surprises on the reader. Excellent villains as well. The only similarities to \\"Code\\" are the cardboard cutout heroine and convoluted conspiracy that stinks of anti-Catholic bigotry. Come on, if the Vatican were that powerful, there'd be no abortion clinics to picket or priest-abuse scandals to read about. Perhaps if Brown takes as much care with his next novel as he did with this one, he can regain his literary self-respect after the \\"DaVinci\\" farce.	2004-04-04

But once again hype has outstripped ability in a literary fiction phenomenon. \\"Kavalier and Clay\\" practically drips flop sweat from every page-Chabon obviously put a lot of work and thought into it. But the characters remain flat on the page; his idea of complexity is to make one hero gay and the other commitmentphobic. And a Holocaust backstory will only get you so far in answering the big questions. How about first asking some big questions? This book depressed me with its modest ambitions and writing-workshop earnestness. Could television-watching be lopping off a dimension of the imaginations of young novelists? Will J.S. Foer save the day? Stay tuned	2004-04-04

It's surprising that the author bothered to craft such an intricate superstructure around such a hollow and one-dimensional character. That said, what a structure! The book, and each chapter within it, practically nails you to the page. Trains were missed, meals were skipped and calls were ignored as I sped through this book.  Too bad the payoff in each chapter is a very predictable: With a soulless monster in the house, what do you think happens to the cute pet, sweet little sister, and bottle of drain opener? In addition, the \\"surprise twist\\" will be a surprise to only a near-comatose reader and the author's sadistic embellishments to the crime at the novel's center make me worry for her mental health. Come on, Ms. Shriver, use your considerable talent to create some believable situations next time, and don't try to be Stephen King-one is enough.

(Sorry, John, the Lloyd Dobler schtick has not aged well at all.) The book's \\"soundtrack\\" such as it is also is much more substantial, heavier on classic soul and lighter on forgettable alt-pop. Britain also works better as a setting for this slight tale, as an American girl would have ditched Rob's butt years before for a better financial prospect.  <BR>Like a Stereolab cut, this book is fun for a quick spin but hardly worth downloading onto the hard drive.	2004-04-04

Any single woman of the present day can recognize some of herself in Lily Bart--the optimism, the refusal to settle, the accumulating horrors of growing old in the sexual marketplace. Even the economic details aren't far off--it's a nasty struggle to make it on your own in New York, and a lot of women seem to count on an \\"ATM\\" (see \\"Bergdorf Blondes\\") or rich boyfriend to make ends meet. As the years pass, this becomes less of an option, and all of us fear the modern version of the drudgery that Lily endures toward the end. A thought-provoking if somewhat depressing story, full of lavish period detail and Wharton's trademark precise and elegant prose. Read it and weep.	2004-04-04

How does this man-whom I picture as some kind of Ur-white male, entombed in Great Books, plastered with awards and walled up in an  ivy tower-speak so directly to my experience as a young woman in 2004? I guess is the same reason that Tolstoy gets to the heart of failing relationships more vividly than any chick-lit author, and Flaubert's descriptions of desire are so much more piercing than any \\"Sex and the City\\" episode. Sheer, freaking genius.<BR>Don't let Bellow's \\"white-maleness\\" or the blizzard of high-culture references scare you off-this is an incredibly moving and powerful book. Sammler, a Holocaust survivor and exiled European intellectual, is watching his life run down in 1960s New York. So much has changed, and so much stays the same. As I was reading this book on the subway in 2004, Bellow could have been sitting next to me in the car, describing what was happening on the platforms rushing by. \\"Sammler\\" made me miss my stop more than once, needless to say. His America is \\"vast slums filled with bohemian adolescents, narcotized, beflowered and `whole.'\\" Yet all of Sammler's and his family's sufferings are somehow uplifting, illustrating the power of a mind over the external world.<BR>Please read this book.	2004-03-30

I would have fought you to the death on that one until I read 'Slightly Settled.' Tracey seems to think about little but losing weight, picking her dress for the party and snagging a boyfriend.  Seeing her boss in his underwear in the hallway? We should all have such earthshaking crises. The book also had several typos and editing errors that reinforced the impression it was a write-to-order rush job. The dialogue is snappy, however, and Tracey gets a few good lines. With this kind of character, I guess it's a relief that no \\"big issues\\" were introduced. For fun, light reading, you can do a lot better, but at least no one gets an eating disorder or dies of AIDS.	2004-03-29

With \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" Dan Brown rivals you for one-dimensional characters, preposterous plot and misogynistic flourishes. However, he does you one better with his crypto-paranoid conspiracy theories centering around the Catholic church and forays into third-rate art criticism. The appeal of \\"Da Vinci\\" is mystifying, especially when Brown's \\"Angels and Demons\\" is a far better book, if you want a religious thriller. That one actually thrills. This one just makes you snicker with its completely inept writing style, character development and plot. Never has Paris been so slighted in fiction-this book is supposedly set in the Louvre but Brown's Louvre has all the atmosphere of a mall poster shop. If you must read a thriller, try Dean Koontz. If you must read Dan Brown, try \\"Angels and Demons.\\" This \\"Code\\" isn't worth cracking.	2004-03-29

Masquerading as chick lit, 'Pink Slip' is actually a genuinely funny and moving novel. No doubt, if it had been written by and/or for men, would have been an award-winner and book-club selection. Bravo to Ciresi as well for making me laugh out loud-I can't count how many bestsellers I've read recently that were skillfully done but suffocatingly serious. A worthy addition to the meager canon of non-Yale, New Haven-set literature, as well! The complicated, sexy and often painful courtship is one of the few modern fictional relationships I've encountered that really rang true. Lisa and Strauss aren't perfect for each other, hurt each other endlessly and have their share of annoying habits. The lingerie of the title comes into play as one of Strauss' less-than-politically-correct quirks, and you end up liking him more for it. I really hated to see these two go at the end of the book. The world Ciresi creates is compelling enough even to sustain subplots on AIDS and the Holocaust without too much strain. As much as I hate the \\"moaning married couples\\" genre, I'll definitely be reading the second book on Lisa and Strauss, and anything else I can find by Ciresi.	2004-03-29

Poor Francesca Delbanco, she seems to have missed that crucial step of maturity. \\"Ask Me Anything\\" is the result, a well-meaning if often cloyingly self-important piece of chick lit that really wasn't worthy of publication.<br />Delbanco sketches some interesting backstory for Rosalie Preston as the main character, but as the book progresses Rosalie never seems to range far from an undergraduate's preoccupation with maintaining a \\"quirky\\" circle of friends and flirting with older men. Her scandalous affair with her friend's dad is frankly unbelievable, as Rosalie as written has little to offer. Declan Pearse as the serious love interest isn't much better.  More successful are scenes that illustrate how self-absorbed amateur actors can be.  The \\"Ask Annie\\" interludes are awkward, interrupt the flow of the story, and come off as painfully pompous. Next time, please Francesca, don't write about what you know.	2004-03-29

I kept it by my bedside for weeks after reading it, hoping the incredible images wouldn't fade from my brain. A woman riding into a new life through the winter wastes of Hungary, a half-abandoned castle in the woods, two boys forging a lifelong friendship at a school for officers of the empire.

I never quite recovered from an extended maggot-fest in the first chapter, rendered in prose that unsuccessfully channels Thomas Harris of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" fame. I stuck with it because I love Dante, and was waiting for some exegesis or at least a novel take on his masterpiece. However, there are far more burrowing larvae and rotting limbs in this book than glimpses of \\"The Divine Comedy.\\" And Pearl manages the trick of having his 19th-century characters mouth 21st-century Harvard pomposity and cant on post-traumatic stress. I admire the author's obvious immersion in history of the period, but this book was much overpraised and the hype surrounding it will probably prevent the author from getting the training in fiction writing that he so badly needs.	2004-03-29

Truly masterful writing and an ability to move and delight place Moorcock in the ranks of great sci-fi writers who transcend the genre, like Neal Stephenson and Orson Scott Card.
