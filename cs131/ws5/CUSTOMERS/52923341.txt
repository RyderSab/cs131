Her happy existence suddenly changes, as her guardian takes her out  of school and into the derelict family mansion.  Strange adventures ensue, including her encounter with the native humanoid tribes, an old robot, and a number of quirky phenomena. <br /> <br />The protagonist is not particularly heroic, but very likable.  Just as she--or her companions start to slide into a template (like a plucky young heroine)--the author skewers the stereotype, but in a very believable, human way. <br /> <br />The adventures that ensue are frequently unbelivable, yet that is a part of the plot.  There is no grand conflict; instead it's a series of adventures with amusing and sometimes touching aspects.  There are plenty of light-hearted references, often ironic, to literature, psychology and metaphysics.  The lack of a central plot is a weakness, but the characters--they are not heroes--are engaging, and so is the book. <br /> <br />--inotherworlds.com	2005-08-22

This fourth book of the Ukiah Oregon series stands well on its own. Shifting viewpoints between Ukiah and his newfound \\"brother\\" Atticus, the plot shows the deadly struggle between the cult of New  Reason, the alien Ontongard, and several parties of good guys. <br /> <br />The novel starts with Ukiah in deadly danger from the cult, and proceeds without stop through confrontations, discovery, and brief, brief moments of happy repose for both \\"wolf children\\". <br /> <br />The alien influence supplies both danger and wonder in this near-future world.  But most of the novel is a skilled, captivating exposition of human emotion--love, need for and fear of trust, and courage.  In the midst of implacable enemies the author manages to fill the book with appealing characters.  Even most of the villains exhibit some interesting qualities, and short sketches of passers-by show three-dimensional attributes. <br /> <br />We learn new things about the Ontongard; and while the conclusion is satisfying, the room is left for more books in the series.

Hamilton's &quot;Anita Blake&quot; novels.  The setting is a small Southern town, several years after the undead came out of the closet, and received recognition as citizens.  Not that the prejudice against them has disappeared. Harris' heroine is less macho than Hamilton's Anita, and the narrative is calmer, for the most part, than LKH's typically breathless race; although there are several terror and rage-filled scenes. In many ways this is also a coming-of-age novel, as Sookie, the heroine, turns from a naive, intentionally simple waitress into an unwilling participant in supernatural politics and an ugly crime investigation, discovering and using hidden resources.<br />Some of the elements are extremely similar to Anitaverse, even more striking considering the trailing advertisements for the AB:VH novels. However, Harris' style is all her own, and this novel is a welcome addition to the most entertaining vampire novels, a class which for me includes, in addition to Anita Blake novels, Collins' Sonja Blue trilogy and Wm.

The case is convincing, and bolstered by colorful anecdotes of abuse, which are incredible despite being easily recollected. Indeed, they were incredible even while they happened.<br />Despite the entertaining and convinicing argument, the book suffers from two flaws. The book feels padded, despite its thinness, as the central premise, despite its value, does not provide much scope.<br />In addition, the book attributes the stock bubble of the late 1990s more to malice than to incompetence. In fact, much of the bubble was due to the classic psychology, composed of greed and self-delusion on the part of analysts, money managers, and the much-defended victim, the individual investor.

Chee of Navajo Police, a solitary, reflective man, investigates a deadly gunbattle between two crooks.  Hampered by the FBI, Chee goes to Los Angelos to find the keys to the puzzling burial of one of the crooks, and the disappearance of an old Navajo and his granddaughter.  In the meantime, he ponders the difficulties of a relationship with a white woman.<br />Lyrical, steady and reflective, with colorful, plausible characters and solid details of the Southwest and the Navajo culture, this mystery encourages the reader to accept its pace.  Chee is a likable protagonist, full of reflection but not angst.<br />The plot development is a bit slow at times, but the resolution is very satisfactory.  For the beautiful job of world-building, solid characters and spare, apt style, this book is recommended.	2001-06-16
US	52923341	R398TM4G2QMBPN	0886779995	613947698	In the Company of Others	Books	4	9	10	N	Y	Well-paced adventure with good characters and ideas	Crowded Earth has terraformed new planets.  Before the colonists landed, the pristine new worlds have been contaminated with a deadly organism--the Quill.  As would-be colonists wait in crowded, failing space stations, the Solar system has been sealed against the alien contamination.<br />A novel of exploration, biological peril, desperation and sacrifice, this is also a novel of hope, courage, affection and occasional humor.  The author mixes emotions well, and produces real conflict with no villains.  The plot moves along at a high clip, but without being choppy.  The adventure is combined well with speculation, but the likable characters provide the real attraction.	2001-06-12

Unfortunately, while full of his usual elements--arguments, force, tense battles, exhausting travels, told at a fast pace--the individual stories have all been told before.  The young Secca could just as easily be Anna of the earlier books, and her ever-multiplying enemies seem no different than Anna's in first three books.  The male chauvinists still doubt a sorceress's deadliness, and countless enemies are characterized only by their enmity and ambition.<br />There is a minor but unexciting romantic subplot, and a more intersting moral opposition to using magic in warfare--where it can escalate to mass-destruction levels.<br />On the whole, if you've read the earlier Spellsong books, you'll find little new here.  If not, start with _The Soprano Sorceress_.	2001-05-29

Surviving prejudice, hard study and deadly bandits, Kel is growing up as an examplary squire.<br />A transition book, with mild romance, conventional plot, but skillful pacing and engaging characters and world, this book will appeal to fans of earlier books, children and adults both.	2001-05-25

A book in the world of _The Thread that Binds the Bones_ (see inotherworlds.com), but unrelated to the earlier book, this fantasy set in our world has Hoffman's characteristic magic, familiar and original at once. It also has the hallmarks of warmth, pleasure, and very human villains.  Combined with romance, murky parentage, strange friendships and various non-human beings, this pleasant melange manages coherency and tight focus, and leaves the reader with a feeling of satisfaction and wonder.	2001-05-25
US	52923341	R3V89LUUNB2LCX	0060273224	962868136	Sabriel (Old Kingdom)	Books	3	3	6	N	N	A tense fantasy with some rough edges	Sabriel, the daughter of a powerful magician, lives on the mundane side of the wall--in a school that could have been in England in the last century.  When her father's duties call her to the wild and magical land, she finds herself under magical attack--and with awsome responsibility.<br />While fascinating, the world had several discontinuities, and Sabriel's peril and exhaustion appeared artificially severe.  The narrative style didn't lend itself to smooth reading--despite the tense plot.<br />One hopes that Nix's next novel is more polished.	2001-05-12
US	52923341	RFA2XBFQSKX5S	0752999036	922720111	Admiral	Books	2	7	9	N	N	A pleasant naval adventure, lacking in excitement.	Dudley Pope has written several naval adventures.  _Admiral_ is one in a series about Ned Yorke, an English Royalist in the West Indies during the Cromwell's Protectorate.<br />With Cromwell's death, Ned turns from a rebel to a privateer.  Attacking the Spanish with his beautiful lover and buccaneer allies, Ned shows his skills as a commander against a background of tropical nature, sailing, treacherous politics and dangerous but declining Spanish Empire.<br />The characters are fairly likable, but there are no interesting villains, and few true challenges, which make the successes in the story less than exciting.  The overall lack of suspense, and lack of a motivating cause on the part of the heroes (other than love of excitement and need for money) prevents this book from rising above a mild entertainment.	2000-10-30
US	52923341	R3CG6SFVI7TRAK	0553108042	732426833	The Grand Ellipse (Bantam Spectra Book)	Books	2	8	12	N	N	A pleasant, but overly long quest.	This, most &quot;modern&quot; installment yet in the world of _Illusion_, combines Victorian technology with deadly magic; WWII-style brutality, Verne-like travel, intrigue and romance. In an alternate world strongly resembling ours, a brutal and efficient empire is conquering the world, while the rest of civilization is frittering away time.  A young woman undertakes a perilous race to win a chance at a magical weapon that can change the balance of power.<br />The mixture of romance, skulduggery, adventure and magic is entertaining, but overly long.  Despite well-drawn characters, the quest contains too many subplots to maintain tension, and the result is less effective than in Volsky's earlier, simpler novels like _The White Tribunal_.<br />The novel takes place decades or centuries later than many of Volsky's books, and has references to places, phenomena, and even titles of her previous works.	2000-10-22
US	52923341	R1IP4VTNHDF4E8	0886779049	321390679	Changing Vision (Web Shifters)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Entertaining, humorous, at times touching space opera	_Changing Vision_ is the sequel to _Beholder's Eye_.  Esen, a unique and reclusive shape-shifter and Paul, her only friend, take a rare vacation, as  a number political intrigues take shape.  Avoiding capture while  simultaneously preventing a war keeps Esen and Paul busy.  With enough  rivalry to fill a Regency Romance, and enough adventures to rival classical  space operas, the plot keeps moving through a plethora of twists, while the  reader is tempted to laugh at Esen, and frequently with Esen.  Despite  occasionally convoluted misunderstandings, this is an enjoyable, fast,  touching and funny sequel to charming novel, full of trademark exotic and  attractive aliens.	2000-08-16

Surprisingly well-integrated, a multi-species platoon faces a ceremonial duty that can  explode into war.<br />A set of likable, although slightly cartoonish  characters, move the plot at a breakneck pace.  The emotions, despite the  horror and the passion of combat, are somewhat superficial, and the  intelligent protagonist is competent enough to avoid much character  development.<br />This is an enjoyable book, although the ending,  well-foreshadowed as it was, left this reader unsatisfied.	2000-04-13

Taking a fresh look at the legend of Medusa, the author avoids most cliches and deftly weaves magic and romance into Roman politics.	1999-10-17
