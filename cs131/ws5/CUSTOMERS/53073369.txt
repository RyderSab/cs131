Yes, I love this book...even though its meant for teens and not their parents (a small chapter in the beginning is written for parents).<br /><br />This book is more for the young person who has decided, on his or her own, to learn without going to school.  Some of this is help on how to convince your parents, some of it is ideas on what and how to study.<br /><br />But most of the kids I know who might have the 'out of school' idea and want to act upon it,  do so because of parents who have encouraged their kids to think and behave as if they were...well..intelligent human beings.<br /><br />I do think this book is for parents, too.  This is the book that made me rethink what I am doing, in realizing homeschooling is an option when you're not thrilled with how your kid is doing in school.<br /><br />When I first started reading, I was still thinking in terms of rating my son's grades (he did C work with an A brain).  But now I've had to rethink my logic -- what do I want for him?  Memorized data so he can get A's or a love of learning, a discovery of his passions, an opening of opportunities.<br /><br />There are chapters about each of the conventional school topics - filled with ideas and thoughts about how to think outside the box in coming up with learning about these topics, without necessarily using textbooks (Math is the exception to not using text books).<br /><br />I would NOT recommend turning this over to a kid who has been in the public school system for all of his learning years.  I WOULD recommend that those wanting to homeschool use this book as another source book for ideas and support in homeschooliing or unschooling.<br /><br />This is also not recommended for parents who prefer a more structured learning environment.<br /><br />We will probably take another look at this in a year or two, depending on how this next year goes for us.<br /><br />Wish us good fortune!  Meanwhile, parents should read this book, even if they aren't comfortable with having their teens take over their own education, read it and learn!n't comfortable with having their teens take over their own education, read it and learn! <br />	2005-06-26

Fiction puts me to sleep -- I have a half dozen fiction books lying about, well written books that just don't grip me enough to give up any time.<br /><br />But this book caught my attention right away -- and I am sorry to find that I'm done with it.  This is an entertaining read - the main characters (Harry and Claire) are likeable, and I could identify with both of them.  The plot is one I like - time travel - and handled well.<br /><br />A matter of fact first person story, about Harry, a librarian who has found himself - since a small child -- responding to stress by vanishing from the present, and appearing somewhere else.<br /><br />Since time travel allows you to bring nothing with you, Harry  suddenly naked, often in some earlier place in his life. Sometimes he appears next to his current self.  He's unable to change the past, though he's tried (often with disasterous results).<br /><br />The book opens with Harry's first meeting with his true love, Claire.  He's 28; she's 20.  But she's known him for over 13 years, though she hasn't seen him for 2 years. -- he hasn't a clue why she is so thrilled to see him.  She's jubilant to see him -- and he looks so young (the first time she met him, he was 36 and she only 6).<br /><br />This is a well written book -- not a short and light fun read, not heavy and scholarly.  It follows the plot well, and kept this reader engaged.  There are perhaps some things I'd want to question, but lightly -- it has none of those errors in logic that a less well written time travel book might have.<br /><br />Harry's experience is not always great -- and Claire, though often patient and accepting, has realistic reactions to the inconvenience of being married to a man who comes and goes, not at his own will.<br /><br />Good writing, enjoyable and yet sticks to your ribs.	2005-06-26

I'm going to do it despite figuring I'll get a zillion negatives from homeschoolers seeking a more structure route for their kids.<br /><br />Despite some negative reviews here, this readable and droll book, with short chapters, is the book we are as a 14 year old's introduction to science book.<br /><br />I'm tired of my son not getting the beauty and wonder of science because he's reading a dry ancient textbook, taught by teachers who don't really like science but have been assigned that topic.<br /><br />As I read this book, I found myself getting more interested in science.  The stories about the scientists are sometimes amusing (even if not entirely true) -- but science presented this way gives an idea of why science was so interesting to people long ago and now.<br /><br />Because it is written for the general reader, and is intended to be interesting (rather than to educate), it connects a lot of learning dots -- science, history, theology, religion, human nature, geology, and vocabulary can all be found woven together in this book.<br /><br />This book is much more likely to open a young person's (or any reader's) interest in the sciences, rather than killing that interest with dull, dry, boring 'facts'.  It puts some life into the subject.<br /><br />Getting upset over the content of this book not being science enough is a bit like getting upset at comedian Jon Stewart because the Daily Show isn't great journalist.<br /><br />Good book to spark the interest -- next step would be to follow interests further, if the reader is so ignited!	2005-06-26

But it has clear written and graphic instructions on melt and pour soaping, along with useful information such as a guide to additives, basic information about setting up your work area, selecting and preparing your molds, determining the right temperature (thermometers are not so necessary in melt and pour, so you're going by 'behavior' and look of the glycerin).  A troubleshooting page is included -- even with melt and pour, there will be problems! She has small sections (sometimes just a page) on mastering fragances, color theories, and other useful bits throughout the book.<br /><br />Please note that in my reviews, recipes are very secondary to me.  In looking at and using soapmaking books, I'm looking for information on how to (create swirls, mix colors or scents in better, use additives, package, wrap, sell).  Recipes give me ideas for recipes to make on my own.<br /><br />I like the variety she offers -- very brief bits on all kinds of soap making - loaf, french milled soaps, commemorative soaps, tube (cane) soaps, leftover soaps (she calls this shelter soap, which makes me wince a bit), soaps with small toys in them, bath salts, soap tassels (invented by Sandy Maine, see my review of one of her books), gemstoneskitchen soap and more).<br /><br />Her recipes are written as instructions, telling you what you will learn.  About 30 recipes, ranging in level of difficulty from one (moldless soap, saving face soap, tropical indulgence soap are examples) to five (Kaila's happy to be bar). She has a recipes for a Victorian bridesmade cake soap (difficulty level four) that looks good enough to eat. Most are in the one to three difficulty level.<br /><br />Four stars, though, not five.  This book is missing some information, and its sources in the back are incomplete. You will need a lot more detailed information for learning how to develop your own recipes. And I wasn't impressed by the picture, on the rainbow loaf soap page, of food coloring bottles -- food coloring is inexpensive, handy and can be used, but it will not last.  No note is made of that in this section, though it really should be noted for beginners.<br /><br />A basic book for beginners -- and fun recipes to try and to add to your own collection.d its sources in the back are incomplete.

A scholarly work, published first in 1970, it is still pertinent to today.<br /><br />It opens with an important chapter on the study of Sufism in the Western world -- and its limitations.<br /><br />Shah raises questions about how much one can learn and understand about Sufism, using books and writings which may not fully understand how Sufism works.  As one example, he uses modern Western debates on the meaning of the word \\"Sufi\\".  Westerners, with our determination that there is an understandable and intellectual explanation for everything, often cannot accept that there may not be a 'logical' explanatin.<br /><br />As explained in the eleventh -century Revelation, the earliest Persian writings on Sufism by Hujwiri,  the term 'Sufi' has no etymology.<br /><br />But for decades, a common explanation by Westerners is that<br />'Sufi' is similar to the Arabic word pronounced soof which means 'wool'. Those practicing Sufism wore wool, therefore this is the logical explanation.<br /><br />(Shah submits that the reason common among Sufis is that the effects of sounds are important in Sufism -- and the sound of the Arabic letters which bring out the sounds of  S  U  F are significant to the Sufis in their practices).<br /><br />This short chapter is full of useful thoughts for modern day Western \\"Sufis\\" , with cautions and thoughts about what Sufism is, how it is understood and much more.  He ends the chapter with a list of requirements for Western students studying Sufism -<br /><br />1. Understand the bulk of translations available are unsuitable 2. seek authorative written and oral information and activities designed by Sufis to operate in the student's own culture and times<br />3. Recognize organizations not genuinely Sufi are 'conditioning instruments' whether consciously or otherwise<br />4. be prepared to abandon preconceptions about what it means to 'study'<br />5. decide whether the student's search is or is not a disguised  search for social integration, a manifestation of sheer curiosity, a desire for emotionial stimulus or statisfactin?<br />6. credit the possibility that there is a conscious, efficient, deliberate source of legitimate Sufic teaching in the West.<br />(These seem to be true and good questions for any Seeker to ask, of any religious practice)<br /><br />This is all in the first chapter, and more - worth the price of the book just to read that section.  But, there is of course, much more.  Shah states the intent of this book is to give geeral reader an idea of the richness and variety of Sufi ideas, and the rest of the writings have been formed as an introduction to Westerners in the mid-20th century, when the book was written.<br /><br />Next is a section on Classic Authors with quotes and short biographical/historical/philosophical information about these authors.  Twelfth century philosopher El-Ghazali, Omar Khayyam, Attar of Nishapar, Ibn El-Arabi, Saadi of Shiraz, Hakim Jami, Hakim Sanai, Jalaludin Rumi are touched on.<br /><br />The next section is Four Major Orders, with short explanations of 1) The Chishti Order 2) The Qardi Order 3) The Suhrawardi Order and 4) The Naqshbandi Order.<br /><br />There are also stories of Sufi Masters, teaching stories, themes for solitary contemplation, group recitals and letters and lectures (very short, at the end).<br /><br />My Turkish daughter in law when introduced to American Sufis in our Quaker meeting looked puzzled -- they did not seem closely related to the Sufis she is familiar with.

There are two parts to Patricia Loring's \\"Listening Spirituality\\". Volume One Personal Spiritual Practices Among Friends, is for individuals. (ISBN 0965759903), Volume Two Corporate Spiritual Practice Among Friends is for those interested in the spiritual life of the whole meeting for worship (ISBN 0965759911).<br /><br />Both of these books are incredible additions to any Quaker library, whether your meeting is programmed or unprogrammed.<br /><br />Volume One is also good for any spiritual seeker to find. She offers guidelines and thoughtful queries that can help you focus on living a more spirit-led life.  Great idea for worship sharing or prayer groups, its chapter titles are revealing of the content \\"Foundational Personal Practices in Support of Listening for God\\", \\"Active Meditative Personal Practices in Support of Listening for God\\", Moving Toward and Away from Listening to God in Contemplative Prayer and Personal Retreats\\".<br /><br />Though those titles may sound a bit stiff and huge, the book is incredibly warm and inviting, soft and centered, inspiring to read.  Inside these chapters, the sections are small, intense and yet sweet - with queries and small stories, information and historical bits.  I wish I was as gifted a writer, so I could get this review right!  This is a wonderful book.  My copy is as crumpled, bent and well loved as any wise old woman could hope to be.<br /><br />The corporate book is highly recommended for clerks - meeting clerks, committee clerks -- and anyone interested in the history and current spiritual nurture of Quaker meetings.  This book goes in my bag for Meeting for Worship with Attention to Business, if only to find an inspiring reading or to give strength to the on-going attempt to keep the focus on the Divine rather than on the secular world.<br /><br />Wonderful wonderful books, true treasures.  They will be classics for years to come.  And you don't have to be a Friend to enjoy and gain from them!	2005-06-01

I wanted something with a spiritual basis, but not just one faith. This book has stories from many places - Buddhist, Hasidic, Middle Eastern, Native American, Sufis, Christian, Desert Fathers, Rumi, Japan, Zen, Burma and Tailand, Africa and China...<br /><br />In her introduction, Pearmain talks about the connection between spirituality and storytelling (my own note: read Psalms or Proverbs aloud if you want to find great stories!) She gives suggestions for personalizing the stories to fit situations, and the use of visualization and journaling.  This is a short section, and not key to the book -- the stories are definitely good ones!<br /><br />Each story fits most often on just two pages -- some a tiny bit longer.  This is handy for those of us with limited room in the brain.<br /><br />Pearmain gives also some ideas after each story for ways to further explore it (through meditation, visualization, writing, art, etc.), on ways for the teller and listeners to make a personal connection to the story, and a little encouraging bit on sharing the story.<br /><br />This book is an excellent source -- short short stories from all around the world, with stories that have a way of telling the truth in an entertaining way.	2005-06-01

Because of this, I find it useful.  It is good for the very new person, and for those like myself who are studying without yet having a teacher and who may not be naturally self-disciplined.<br /><br />It begins with a four week section designed so the reader knows how to set up the basic elements - breathing, sitting meditatin, daily life practices and such, both formally and informally. After this phase is completed, the student will have the basics as part of a schedule and can move on.<br /><br />In the fifth through eighth weeks, the student learns to focus on mindfullness of body, feelings, thinking and objects of mind (this last chapter focuses on thoughts, feelings, or object of perception which our mind is focusing on - and includes mindful conversation and deep listening).<br /><br />In the third section, weeks nine and ten, one practices loving kindness and compassion.<br /><br />At the beginning of each section there are two guided meditations you can use, breathing in, breathing out (and specific sentences to help guide you)<br /><br />The final section has ways to continue this.<br /><br />This book is very good as a help to those working alone. A good-sized book, it offers over 200 pages of instructions, not including introduction, appendix, index and other comments.

This book does not promise short term, quick fixes but encourages a way of life that will make living more joyful and meaningful - pain, change and all.<br /><br />This is not a book of \\"thought\\" filled advice from the mind, but a book (as the subtitle states) of heart advice. Pema openly shares some of her own experience as things fall apart, when her old way of doing things was no longer working.<br /><br />I bought it to give to my (fully grown) son when he was going through some difficult times.  It wasn't what he needed or related to, so I read it myself.<br /><br />I like the way she points out that when things fall apart, that usually means we are on the brink of a change of some kind.  My usual practice is to try to hold on to the familiar ways, but as I am finding out, that just doesn't work.  And if it does, I am usually even more miserable.  Depending on the kind of change you are experiencing, allowing it to happen with less resistance, without fear, can ease the opening to a new way.<br /><br />This is a disturbing thought to many of us.  Give in? No way. Why, what if your spouse is cheating and you lose your job and you have a fatal illness and the sky is falling and you don't resist?  (Ah, well -- most probably your spouse will still have cheated, that job will be lost, you will still have the illness and the sky will continue to fall.)<br /><br />On page 10 she says, \\"To stay with that shakiness -- to stay wth a broken heart, with a rumbling stomach, with the feeling of hopelessness and wanting to get revenge-- that is the path of true awakening. Sticking with that uncertainty, getting the knack of relaxing in the midst of chaos, learning not to panic-- that is the spirtual path.\\"<br /><br />This book reminds us again, that going with the pain, confusion, disorder of those falling apart times is necessary.  Eventually we can get to a place where the pain does not seem so big or so deep, where we are no immersed in our own dramas but see everything on a larger world wide scale.<br /><br />I liked her section on \\"It's Never Too Late\\", which is about not hating ourselves -- and not really condoning ourselves, but observing ourselves -- 'when we buy into disapproval, we are practicing disapproval. When we buy into harshness, we are practicing harshness...The trick then is to practice gentleness and letting go. We can learn to meet whatever arises with curiosity and not make it such a big deal.\\"<br /><br />This is a truly helpful book, if you can read it expecting a deeper, long-term change in how you experience the unexpected and unwelcome turns we find in our lives.<br /><br />I realized after reading this, that what I perhaps need to do with my son is not to buy him a book to read, but to be there for him as needed but to allow him to have his own experiences.ything on a larger world wide scale. <br /> <br />I liked her section on \\"It's Never Too Late\\", which is about not hating ourselves -- and not really condoning ourselves, but observing ourselves -- 'when we buy into disapproval, we are practicing disapproval.

(Human beings).  We are confused. We think we know, or we think we can know.  This section is very wordy, long and thick.  So are we.  Hah.<br /><br />The second goes back and tries to view our experiences with a different view.  Pure Mind.  It offers some thoughts and stories, some explanations about why we are so muddy and what it would be like if we were not.<br /><br />The third section, Purely Mind (a small section indeed) on being in the moment.<br /><br />The book is a frustrating experience because it is a book. It contains thoughts of someone, when perhaps we are seeking experience.<br /><br />I read and read, looking for explanations and answers that I know, from brief moments, are not 'there' and cannot really be explained well.<br /><br />Until we stop reading the books and 'get it' I don't know that a book will be what we want in finding freedom beyond beliefs. Because Buddhism is not what you think.  Nor what you read.	2005-05-31

I had little memory of what it was about, just that I knew it was written by someone who was an important world leader.  He was Secretary-General to the United Nations and died on the way to Northern Rhodesia in 1961, on his way to negotiate a cease fire between the UN and Katanga forces.<br /><br />This book tells almost nothing of his daily work, or of his thoughts about world events.  Instead, it focuses on his struggle and changing relationship with God.<br /><br />Excerpts are from his diary, starting when he was a young man in 1925 and ending just a few months before his death at the (to me!) tender age of 57.<br /><br />A reviewer here made comments about this being thoughts of a socialist and athiest -- clearly he did not read the book. The writings inside this awe inspiring book are from a man deeply and directly talking to his God.  His concerns are for others, not for himself.<br /><br />When I read the book, I realized some part of me must have remembered this deep connection with God, something I, too, have longed for and have found at times (when I am open to receive!) Dag Hammersjold had been filed in my subconscious as a mentor, a teacher I could return to when I could better understand what his words were expressing.<br /><br />This book is a wonder to experience -- what a privilege to have been allowed to come so close to his thoughts, his soul, his own experiential experience of the Divine.  It is not intended to provoke thoughts and philosophical wonderings within the mind of the reader, but instead to offer a view of someone who is connecting their soul rather than their mind, with God.  Dag Hammersjold was a mystic - not a new agey kind of a guy, but a Christian mystic of the 20th century (see Thomas Kelly's books, Thomas Merton's books, and others).<br /><br />His diary, unlike Kelly's writings, is not filled with the joy of his spiritual connection with God -- he struggled painfully with the awareness of his own human imperfections and shortcomings.  I only hope that in his last moments, he came to realize more peace and to accept and experience, first hand,  God's love for him.<br /><br />(The only downside to this book is that the printing is old - the cover was brand new but the words are fuzzy as if they were copied from a copy...)'s books, and others).

I've been using it myself (just testing it out!) and want to keep one for myself - and recommend it to friends.<br /><br />Why is it so good?<br /><br />It is designed for all users - beginners, seniors, children and off and on yoga folks like myself.<br /><br />There are full color illustrations for every move - arrows show how to get into different positions and how to get out.<br /><br />Sections are divided by sitting, reclining, standing -- very nice for those who only want to do one kind of pre-stretch or yoga program (sitting, for my mother)<br /><br />The front has detailed explanations and photos of each stand, divided into sections.  Easy to read, great photos again with the little arrows telling users how to get from one pose to the next.<br /><br />After this, there are beginner and intermediate practices using the photos.  If you are supposed to be doing a Little Boat pose as part of a program, you have a little picture and an easy cross references if you need to be reminded of the details.<br /><br />Nice index in the back.  I'd love to see either a second version with more programs (I'm way too lazy to make my own) or a set of cards with the photos for those who travel (I'd be more likely to make out my own program with a deck of cards!)<br /><br />Excellent book, worth the price.	2005-05-30

This book clearly isn't an information about soapmaking book -- it is actually a bit more and a bit less than that.<br /><br />This book presents itself like a gift book -- remiscent of a table top gift book.  Tucked into the pages are Maine's basic beliefs on the goodness of home recipes for soaps, shampoos. There are little bits on skin care and hair care. She provides her favorite recipes, using many of the same ingredients.<br /><br />Although she refers to the training received in the first chapters, it is less training than a lovely presentation -- for a how to of soap making, I'd use a more informational book or information from a class (for soaps made with lye, thank you very much, pretty pictures are not enough!)<br /><br />In addition to the interesting recipes (for Russian Dishwashing Disk, for example) there is a chapter on Toilet Bowl Cleaners, a Leather Care recipe, a chapter on Making Your own laundry supplies, another on Natural Pet Care and a section on her invention of the \\"soap tassels\\" line -- with a couple of recipes.<br /><br />The idea, I think, is to take her basic vegetable based recipes (CRISCO OIL!!!) and be motivated to make up some of your own, using the logic behind the percentages she uses and the combination of fragrances, seeds, herbs and such.<br /><br />An addition to the library -- still haven't found my basic must have can't do without soapmaking book!	2005-05-30

Another book to add to my soapmaking library, Grosso's book is a little different from the rest.<br /><br />Her recipes are for cold process soaps in small (one bar) recipes, a good starting place for a beginner.  Working with lye can be a dangerous process, so having very small batches is a wise beginning.<br /><br />She writes a lot about the magikal (which I like to translate to spiritual) aspect of soapmaking - different herbs have different magical properties according to Grosso, so soap can be a healing gift for a friend.<br /><br />She has a lists for essential oils, flowers, herbs, seeds listing some special properties. (the herb Dandelion reduces fear, useful in manifesting intention...and you thought they were weeds)...Vetivert essential oil is deeply calming. Lavendar flowers are sleep-inducing, soothing, etc.)  No use of animal fats, a plus for some of us.<br /><br />Good black and white pictures of the actual soapmaking process and explanations of different procedures (saponification, etc.) Basic recipe is used with additions of other things.  Yes, she is a bit heavy on the coconut oil.<br /><br />For those who are interested, she has soap making rituals, Moon phases, soapmaking for women, soapmaking for men,  for every day occasions, for holidays.  There's a little chapter on \\"presentation\\" (gift wrapping or packaging).<br /><br />This isn't a book for everyone, and even if it is for you, it shouldn't be the only book -- just something a little different.	2005-05-30

This book is about Quaker decision-making, but the use of the secularly familiar word \\"consensus\\" in the previous review may be misleading.  Sheeran examines and explores in great depth how Friends come to make decisions.<br /><br />Both simple and complicated, the process comes out of a history and practice based on spirit-led decision making.<br /><br />The book can explain far better than I what the process is, how it can work amazingly well, how it may sometimes fail.  The decision-making process among Friends is what 'hooked' me to keep coming to meetings, especially decision-making meetings (Meeting for Worship with Attention to Business).  When it works it is an awe-filled experience.  When it doesn't, the results of the decision often crumble.<br /><br />An excellent book for new clerks and newcomers, as well as a reminder to Friends who may be tempted to fall back on the corporate or secular world's way of finding consensus.	2005-05-30

This is a book I wish I'd found years ago (before it was written)!<br /><br />Almost everyone lives the divided life.  (I suspect the Dalai Lama does not).  As Palmer notes, sometimes we have to -- this is a choice we sometimes must choose to make. One of the reasons I love this book so is that Palmer does not have rigid judgmental expectations of us (we probably are harsh enough on ourselves).  He offers guidelines and explanations for the human condition, and some help on getting through.<br /><br />Parker Palmer takes a long time Quaker practice -- the Clearness Committee - and uses it to provide for everyone a Circle of Trust.  This mutual support network is unusual -- it isn't an advisory committee but more support for listening to that inner voice which we may joke about, but which exists (you know, the one you should have listened to, that nagging feeling, that annoying little warning sign).<br /><br />One thing that makes us crazy is the denial of that inner voice, our true self, the divided side of self that knows the questionable aspects of our work life, the one we hush up so we can get by and make a living.  This isn't just a teacher's issue or a spiritual issue.  For some it may be a spiritual divide; for others, a more humanistic one.  In any case, we become emotionally, mentally and otherwise unbalanced if our day to day movements and choices feel separate from -- or in conflict with -- our beliefs and values, and yet we deny that they are so.<br /><br />We do not allow ourselves to hear that inner voice, afraid of the changes we might have to make.  We smush it down, despite knowing intellectually that anything you smush down in one area pops up in another.  This book offers recognition of this conflict we are in, and gives us ways we can listen without, necessarily, having to make changes that will make us walk out from or get fired from our daily bread earning jobs.<br /><br />This is one to have, to give, to read and reread, to keep by the bedside or take on business trips.make us walk out from or get fired from our daily bread earning jobs. <br /> <br />This is one to have, to give, to read and reread, to keep by the bedside or take on business trips.   <br />	2005-05-30

Books	4	32	35	N	N	Good resource	I kept looking through this book, undecided - but eventually had to get it since it is (so far) the only book on soapmaking I've found that has a bunch of advice (Chapters 7 - 10) on pricing, marketing and selling soap.<br /><br />The first part has some practical advise on soap making from setting up a work station to using essence oils.  Basic information for Melt and Pour, hand-milled and Cold Process soapmaking, with a saponification chart, which is useful.<br /><br />Nerius offers guidelines, advise, basic info which is also findable in various places (on the internet primarily) but it is helpful to have it in book form, and all in one book.<br /><br />The recipes are secondary to the rest of the book -- there is advise on making your own recipes, which is a good thing to know. A little more information about vegetable oils as a choice for one's basic recipe (rather than one \\"Vegetarian Delight\\" recipe) would be good.<br /><br />Her cold process basic soap recipe includes rendered beef fat/tallow -- it almost sounds as if that's the only kind of CP soap to make - a negative for some of us.  (My rating should be a 3.5 stars instead of 4, for this reason).  However, in the old days, soap was made with animal fats so this is my own personal criticism.<br /><br />About 1/3 of the book is a mini-course in crafts business basics, written by Barbara Brabec - a book within a book. This, to me, was too much info in a book on soap making (a lot of the advise does not relate to the specifics of soap making).  I would have preferred to do without it, but now I have it handy in case I need it.<br /><br />Not the ONLY book to have on soapmaking, but a plus to a soapmaker's library.	2005-05-30

I've been cooking from a variety of low carb cookbooks, trying to find meals, snacks (especially snacks), desserts and other comfort foods that will please my family's palette while meeting my desire to eat fewer processed foods and fewer -- maybe no -- unhealthy foods (those I love and miss so much -- like donuts and white pasta, fresh baked breads and rolls -- I could go on and on!)<br />The intent of this book isn't necessarily to give you all the low carb recipes you'll ever need, but to provide you with tasty substitutes for those foods you really miss so you won't fall of the low carb wagon. These are comfort foods, sorely needed by me and most of my low carb friends!<br />A couple of the  reviews I've read here seem to indicate the reviewers  a) haven't used this cook book b) don't understand the logic behind low carb living or c) both.<br />The Magic Rolls are terrific -- yes, they call for flour, but not unprocessed white flour.  No, it doesn't use sugar at all. For recipes needing sugar, they suggest a well-known sugar substitute. The rolls came out fabulously; we have used them as rolls, bagel substitutes, hamburger rolls etc.  All of the ingredients were found in a large chain grocery store here in Ohio.  The preparation didn't take too much hard work, I made a lot and froze what wasn't devoured (only takes a microwave moment to warm them up from frozen).<br />Why I love this book best -- I recognized many of their recipes, found (and used by me) scattered through other low carb books -- this one has all the ones I love tucked inside, plus more. And they have helpful low carb cooking information in the opening part of the book.  They have info in every recipe showing how much carb and protein counts are in each serving.<br />The authors focus on comfort foods (rolls, meatloaf, gravy, apple brown betty, now there's a meal I no longer need to miss!) along with simplicity -- these are foods you can cook for the family that don't require a gourmet kitchen, training, budget or lifestyle. There are also a lot of Italian and Mexican recipes, two of my family's favorites.<br />I am suggesting this to all of my friends who are trying low carb, not no carb, eating because this has recipes that can help sustain a change to that lifestyle!licity -- these are foods you can cook for the family that don't require a gourmet kitchen, training, budget or lifestyle.

We think if we do things the right way, or if other people would, then eventually life would become easier. Our material needs will be met, love will bloom forever, bad things won't happen to us, and life will unfold according to our individual needs and wishes.<br />Guess again. If you're constantly trying hard and finding life to be a major disappointment, you may find comfort and practical help in the reading and re-reading of this book.<br />Peck writes in an easy to read, easy to understand manner, writing of his life and that of many of his own patients. He begins with a section on Discipline; the next is on Love; then Growth and Religion; closing (how appropriately) with Grace.<br />When first I read this, in my mid-twenties, (living life in what one of my 'friends' called Life in the Breakdown Lane) the sections didn't look like they'd offer anything to help me. Discipline was something I wanted to act out against, not find solace in. The section on Love, I was disappointed to find, did NOT provide any instructions on how to find a knight on a white horse. Growth and Religion seemed some kind of a paradox to me, and I was sure that Grace was nothing more than a name I wished I had.<br />But within those Sections I have again and again(at different levels) found peace of mind through solutions that at first I didn't fully understand, but came to believe in -- for anyone looking for help in improving their lives, from a non-dogmatic, non-fundamentalist point of view, I'd strongly recommend this book.<br />Read it, learn from it, and just as happens to the bunny in the children's book, The Velveteen Rabbit, you'll find yourself becoming more alive, and more 'real.'<br />I'd also encourage the reading of Sheldon Kopp's &quot;If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him&quot; and (if you're looking for some comic relief, always good when stressed) watch &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot;<br />This is truly a gem of a book (though I haven't liked many others of his).ief, always good when stressed) watch &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot;<br />This is truly a gem of a book (though I haven't liked many others of his).	2003-07-18

She includes all the wrinkles, twists and lines that real life brings to us.  In this book she shares the kinds of things you might think about, but not speak, the contents of a personal journal, introspective and quite true.<br />She has managed to make the most of her life, and this book is a wonder to read.  Her writing style is one that invites the reader along, and I felt (as you probably will) as if this was part of a conversation with a close friend, part with myself, part simply a life viewed through a warm and inviting window.<br />She writes about so much, this book is incredibly full -- I'm not done yet reading it again and again.<br />A quote I love, &quot;Long before I ever met Alan, I wondered if any man of my generation could love a woman his own age, could feel passion (and compassion) for her aging, vulnerable flesh, could open himself to a soul-deep love even as he himself loses muscle tone, stamina and hair -- could well and truly stand naked in front of another and not be ashamed.

As a rape survivor, I usually try to avoid the topic since it brings up painful memories.  I was sure the story would be depressing  (what else could a child's rape and murder be?), and the world is dark enough these days.  But primarily I didn't want to pick it up since books that are suddenly popular often turn out to be some kind of disappointment, usually too shallow or too shocking.  When I started to read this book, I didn't want to put it down.<br />The first person telling of the murder and rape from a young victim's view sounds so sensationalized.  But Sebold is no yellow journalist.  This is the tender telling of the effects of this killing by someone (revealed early) known to the little girl, a mystery to the family.<br />This is not a murder mystery along the lines of bestselling, popular shock writers.  It isn't written from any kind of formula, but is loosely based on the author's own rape as a college student (though thankfully, she lives to tell her tale).  In this fictionalized story, the murder is never truly solved, or resolved, though eventually everyone knows 'who dunnit.'<br />A soft and thoughtful read, sad but hopeful too as our young victim watches how lives are changed, and how life goes on, after her death.  Look for 'Lucky,&quot; her equally well-written story of the real life rape, and the changes it brings to her life and that of her family.	2003-02-15

At that time I was also traveling and found there was little time to get my body back into shape (as well as I could) and be healthy.<br />The three pound weights fit into my suitcase and all you need is a chair -- no fancy equipment.  At home, I could always squeeze 12 minutes into my morning routine.<br />Using this book, watching my diet (she addresses that) and doing cardiovascular exercises (in-line skating was my choice then) I managed (in 4 months) to eliminate only 13 pounds BUT I lost an amazing amount of inches, going from a size 12 to a size 8.<br />I find this book very helpful -- I'm a sometimes exerciser, getting off the track periodically.  This book is a joy to return to, a health and fitness aid I keep around, bringing it out to rejuvenate my routines.  The exercises are effective and for some of us, are better than those you do in the gym because they are so easy to do, right in your own home or hotel room.	2002-07-21

This book has been a sort of 'support' book to me, a sometimes working out person over 50.  I get on the fitness path, then fall off and bemoan the fact that I'm getting old and will probably die of a stroke.<br />Well, duh -- with my family history, that's probably true if I continue to live a computer potato life. (My mother had her stroke two years ago -- I had mine at the tender age of 33).  This book is helpful to 'reboot' myself when I've gotten offtrack and have stopped my daily walking, attempts at weight training, and dabbling in yoga.<br />The author, a physician, shares his own steps off of the path to fit living and offers a little bit of many things -- cardiovascular exercises, flexibility, strength building, healthy eating.  Each chapter starts off with a short story about different people and their switch from unmindful living to healthy awareness.  I don't like that he doesn't mention yoga, or strokes, but there are other books on those topics.<br />The message in this helpful book has to do with the fact that we're all getting older and can't stop that, but we don't have to be old, unfit and helpless. A tiny bit of exercise can go a long way to improve mind, body and spirit.<br />A good starter book that will refresh and remotivate!	2002-07-21

My youngest child (almost 11 as of this writing) often enjoys having books read aloud, in the evening or while we're on vacation far from the television.  It can be a challenge to find something we'll both enjoy.  My only stipulation is that I get to pick the book (and that they won't come from his favorite horror series books) His stipulation is that we'll stop reading if the first chapter is boring.<br />This book was one we both enjoyed.  We read a chapter or two a night, sometimes more when it was really exciting.  We always looked forward to reading some more.<br /><br />The main character is an outcast within an outcast society, Spaz (an epileptic loner.)  He meets some other misfits -- an elderly writer in a world without books, a homeless five year old who can only say one word and an advanced (improved) human who goes against the rules of her own perfect Eden.<br />The story, told in first person from the view of Spaz, was engrossing, filling our minds with sometimes horrifying visions of a new futuristic world, where a huge earthquake years ago upset civilization as we now know it.  The gray skied, cement grounded cities (Urbs) are run by latchlords, gang lords who make and enforce their own ever changing rules. They can and do eliminate anyone for any reason - or no reason at all.  Escape from reality is sought by nearly everyone, including the latchlords. Most people have become addicts to needles inserted into the brain, giving the viewer a realistic mind show with images of a perfect world.  Mindprobes have replaced drugs, TV and video games, but they are beginning to disrupt the 'leadership' of the latchlords, bringing anarchy and total destruction to the Urbs.<br />Far away from the Urbs (which are connected by pipelines) is Eden, home of the &quot;proovs&quot; who are genetically improved humans, thought to be superior to the 'normals.' &quot;Normals&quot; aren't allowed in Eden, where they could actually see a blue sky and green grass, things they 'd heard about from old timers, but which they believe can only be fairy tales.<br />Spaz's foster sister Bean - the only human who means anything to him - is dying in another Urb, and this emotionally numbed boy decides to risk leaving his Urb and travel through the pipelines to visit her one last time.<br />He is unhappy to end up journeying with his outcast acquaintances Ryter and Chox), aided by Lanaya (a perfect girl from Eden) on a journey to save Bean -- and while they're at it, to change the world.  Likeable characters plus some who aren't so nice.  A touch of violence and scary confrontations.

This revised Joy of Cooking (hardcover) book is a great investment for anyone who cooks -- whether a frequent, occasional, experienced or novice cook.<br />I'm no longer a frequent cook.  But as always, when I'm in the kitchen, neatness is not one of my strong points.  My paperback version of this book -- purchased in the 70's, when I did cook a lot -- started falling apart due to rough treatment, page splatters and just because it was a paperback book. I couldn't live without it, but was worried that I was overspending on a hardcover.<br />It is well worth the money -- this book has been revised, and offers more than it did before, about things that weren't so 'mainstream' back in the 70's.<br />These days I'm more interested in grains and beans, with more vegetarian meals. My sons are meat eaters, and when I am cooking, it is usually for a group.  I love this book because it makes me feel like a serious chef, without being intimidating.  This is a lovely cookbook for the ordinary cooker, urging you to try something new because it explains everything so well, without talking down to you.<br />I might use a recipe not in this cookbook, but I go to these pages first to learn about whatever it is I'm cooking -- soup, for example.  In here I've learned more than I'll never need to know about soups -- vegetarian stocks, meat stocks, how to store soups, what to put in soup, how to serve soup, and some really handy information on different kinds of soup &quot;equipment&quot; (who knew -- I always thought a crock pot, a ladle and some bowls would do it all.)<br />I love a book that comfortably comes to bed with me at night, like a juicy novel. This book will intrigue the reader, like a fascinating history story. One can learn about tropical exotic fruits; cooking methods; ingredients from baking powder to spices to yogurts; and more.  Get permission to make baklava using store bought phyllo rather than handmade, and find out it is originally a Turkish dish, not Greek.<br />The book bypasses slick photographs in favor of drawings of up-to-date equipment. In addition to making yourself, or your main cook very happy, this is also a fantastic and classy gift for anyone, from a bachelor son who enjoys cooking to a new bride and groom.  The hardcover edition is the best investment, offering a book that will last a long time, some 3 PLUS inches thick, with a wonderful red ribbon bookmark to mark your place.r />The book bypasses slick photographs in favor of drawings of up-to-date equipment.

I bought the hard back version and wish I'd waited for the paperback (though I definitely recommend this as an intriguing read).<br />My own lack of any depth of knowledge about Middle Eastern and Eastern world history made it hard for me to appreciate and analyze this alternate history for probability.  Still, I was able to appreciate the notion of an alternative life without Europe and America as we know them, with technology still developing.  There is an amusing discussion between characters about whether or not England would have ever amounted to more than a backwards nation had the plague not wiped them out (most seemed to think this was not very likely).<br /> The characters we meet in the beginning are reincarnated for centuries, as men, women and in one case, tiger, traveling in the same group.  Between lives they meet in the barrio to compare notes, critique each other, lament over their lack of progress and develop plans to better recognize each other and remember from previous lives (they never did this very well)!<br />Things I didn't like included the lack of comparative timelines; too much poetry in places it didn't seem to fit; beginning chapters had annoying comments from the narrator that were supposed to lead you to the next chapter; the ending was somewhat unclear and fizzled out.<br />The storyline petered down as if the author was in a rush to finish, leaving questions that were barely touched on, certainly not opened enough to lead to a good debate. Although technology moves on, the characters begin to dismiss reincarnation in favor of a belief in one chance, one life.  Disappointing, since this seems to indicate that the author thinks despite the dominance of Eastern religions, this alternate world would spiritually parallel the Western world today. Since it is clear (in the book) that reincarnation does exist, is the author saying that it doesn't necessarily mean we develop spiritually?  Is he presenting the notion that the more man develops technologically, the more he dismisses spirituality?  If so, his change from reincarnation exists to it does not was too abrupt and shallow to initiate a full discussion, leaving me frustrated.  The ending begs for more.<br />Still a good read, thought provoking (I gave my copy to one of my son's, but would definitely like to read it again after checking out eastern history a bit more).  But in my own reading reincarnation, I'd wait for the paperback edition.y?  Is he presenting the notion that the more man develops technologically, the more he dismisses spirituality?

Heavy on both romance and the environment, with likable characters and thought provoking questions.<br />We meet several characters and visit them in alternating chapters, all in the same rural area in southern Appalachia.  Everyone is equally interesting for different reasons, a pleasure to return to (unlike books I've read where I've found myself skipping chapters that characters that seemed superfluous or boring).  Common themes are concerns about the difficulties and pleasures of living with the land, animals and people around us, without misusing the same.<br />Deanna has retreated to the mountains after a failed marriage, now working away from people as a Forest Ranger.  She encounters a younger man and realizes her hunger to be with people, along with her anger at having that need.  (He is pretty superfluous -- handsome, sexually exciting but a coyote hunter, his character is primarily a backdrop for her to realize and present her opinions.)  Lusa is a young Jewish woman who marries a farmer. After his untimely death, she must deal with his sisters, who seem to resent her taking over their family farm. She struggles to be accepted and to accept her changing lifestyle, to find ways to grow and survive both personally and on the farm. Ancient widower Garnett Walker III is a crusty and cantankerous old soul, set in his convictions and not very open to change.  He offers a bit of comic relief, a recognition of that in ourselves that does not want to change or admit to being wrong even for our own good. He also represents those who believe firmly in Creationism and technology (a somewhat strange combination). He is paired against (or is it with?) his neighbor, the never married Nannie Land Rawley, aging hippie, organic farmer, single mother of a long dead child.  These characters are all revealed slowly to be connected. There are mainly upbeat and welcome changes and developments to be found.<br />I've never read a book quite like this, one that reads like a lazy summer romance, but with a liberal (literally and figuratively) sprinkling of environmental and biological concerns that make it a bit more filling than most.  Entertain and educate yourself!ver read a book quite like this, one that reads like a lazy summer romance, but with a liberal (literally and figuratively) sprinkling of environmental and biological concerns that make it a bit more filling than most.

There had to be more in the books, I hoped -- and there certainly is!<br />This book gives a deep, full view of the Walker family, showing the pattern and likenesses in Viviane Walker's life and those in her eldest daughter, Sidalee's. Rebecca Wells somehow takes the short vignettes from Little Altars, and expands them.  Sida retreats to a friend's cabin to sort out her forty year old life, peering into the oversized scrapbook with the Divine Secrets pasted and stuck inside.<br />She gets some pieces of the whole story -- letters, a conversation with some of her mother's friends, newspaper articles -- and eventually she can see her mother as more than a once abusive, often drunk, perpetually self-centered woman.  But we are allowed to see even more -- she gets a more complete story, but we get to feel the connections between events, as well as discovering matching patterns in Sida's and her mother's lives.  This is all done in an incredibly gentle and subtle manner, not maudlin, not glossy.<br />The story -- book and movie -- is about enduring friendship, a mother's love, a daughter's pain, reconciliation and forgiveness. If you liked the characters in the movie, this book will give you more -- not neccessarily in quantity, but certainly in quality.<br />If you are more comfortable with Shep as the patient, understanding father and husband, if you liked the smooth and happy ending, you may find the books disturbing (but read them anyway --  excellent writing, a joy to read!)<br />This is a wonderful completion of the story begun in Little Altars, as well as a fuller, deeper, more realistic rendition of what we see in the movie.begun in Little Altars, as well as a fuller, deeper, more realistic rendition of what we see in the movie.	2002-06-17

Richer, darker and deeper than the second book or the movie, this book truly is a 'must' read if you want to understand the Walker family, especially the mystery who is Viviane Abbot Walker.<br />Starting as a simple short story (&quot;Looking for My Mules,&quot; with Shep, Viviane and an old man lost on their farm), Rebecca Wells' tales of growing up in Louisiana in a less than perfect home grew first into Little Altars Everywhere, then into the Divine Secrets book and movie.  Each chapter contains a well crafted short story, told from the viewpoint of different characters.  Each chapter offers a title with the name of the narrator and year they are talking in. In some cases, the titles are enough to draw you in (Catfish Dreams; E-Z Boy War; The Princess of Gimmee.)<br />From the 60's to the 90's, each story offers a simple, but meaningful slice of the entire Walker family's story.  Some are told in the present, some are memories of what happened long ago.  The chapters weave together to give you a wider view of what was going on from different perspectives.<br />As you read, you'll find yourself piecing together the story of Sidalee, her siblings, her mother Vivi and father Shep, as well as Willetta and Chaney, the black couple who were hired help, and who have an outside view of the family.<br />Don't stop reading with this book, or you'll miss a view of the whole person -- doting mother, child abuser, unloved child, shattered schoolgirl, broken hearted, passionate lover, distant wife and mother as well as a view of Shep as a fallible human being and how he contributed to Vivi's 'condition' and the affect it had on their children.<br /> A treasure of a book,  you may find it more unsettling than the movie or the second book.  Excellent writing, it will leave you wanting to know more (unless you've already read the second book!)	2002-06-17

After reading everything I could find by Neil Gaiman, a bookseller suggested this book -- he said it was hilarious, and he was right!<br />What a joy to read!  This story was a delightful relief, an escape from the 6 o'clock news where the line between the good guys and the bad guys is presented as having a crisp black and white line (no matter what side you're on, &quot;They&quot; are 100% Evil, and &quot;We&quot; are 100% Good.)  In this story, the division is not that pristine.<br />Armageddon and the end of the human race is supposed to be underway on Saturday -- but everything's been a bit mixed up because eleven years ago, the Antichrist was accidentally switched at birth by one of the Sisters from the Chattering Order.<br />The young Lord to Be of the Underworld was supposed to have been named Warlock, and raised by an American ambassador. Instead, he's just a country boy, riding his bicycle with his three good friends and faithful hound (a downsized dog from you-know-where), living a rather wholesome life in the small village of Tadfield, with no properly evil training.<br />Long time arch rivals and good friends Crowley and Aziraphale will be in deep trouble with the Devil and God, their respective bosses, unless they find the missing child.  These two oddfellows have mixed feelings about the ending of the earthly world -- they've come to like the human race, and have found earthly things they will sorely miss -- things you can't get in Heaven or the Underworld!<br />So, get this book and go with them as they frantically search for the missing leader of the end of the world, while the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse approach on their Harleys.  Try to sort out the good guys from the bad guys. Newton Pulsifer, the scientific minded descendant of the main witchfinder who centuries ago burned the last real witch and prophetess Agnes Nutter is about to meet Anathema Device, Agnes's descendant, a young occultist. They are both moving toward Tadfield to destroy or support the only living person who can save the human race from absolute destruction.<br />Who will find whom, when, where and how?  And will good triumph over evil -- or is there a bit of good in even the nicest earthbound angel, and a touch of good in the most evil demon on earth?<br />An irreverent, witty, charmingly twisted view of that eternal battle between good and evil.

Set in modern London, our hero, Richard Mayhew, is an extremely ordinary nice guy, engaged to an extremely self-centered beauty.  On their way out one evening, he stumbles (literally) over a young woman (Door) who needs help.  Despite his fiancee's threats and whines, Richard does -- as one suspects he always does -- the right thing.<br />The &quot;right thing&quot; leads into an exciting adventure in the underworld of London that satisfies most of my needs to escape my own ordinary life.  There are subway cars that host small earldoms, alleys with the addition of underground hide-outs unseen by any but those who belong, a good bad guy, a bad good guy, some fairly mild struggles, lots of dry humor, no distracting romance, and wonderful characters.<br />Two elderly but very mean bad guys manage to be amusing in their dreadful conversations (in between doing what they love to do most -- torture, maim and eliminate those who are on their list or in their way.)  The toughest 'guy' in the book for the longest time turns out to be Hunter, a supporting (female) character.<br />Gaiman is an excellent storyteller. This book was so good I had to force myself to put it down, because at the time I didn't have another of his books to read.  The ending left me wanting more -- indeed, this was a mini-series in England (when do we get to see it?) that would be loved here.  Another book or two following Mayhew's life (it'll never be the same!) would enliven my own drab life!<br />Different than American Gods -- not suitable for the younger Harry Potter readers, but there's something about the decidedly English perspective that makes the violence mildly amusing (and besides, in the neverworld, the dead aren't always terminally dead!)<br />A great book, I've already passed mine on to a friend!

I wanted Amazon to deliver this book to my door in a plain brown wrapper.  Pop psychotherapy. Easy answers.

And I've been on this earth (and in psychotherapy) for years. Surely I've already discovered everything of meaning in my life. I was drawn to the promise of this book, still thinking -- what possible good could reading this book do for me?<br />The answer -- a lot.  If you faithfully read it and follow his instructions, hidden truths will be revealed.  For me there was something about using the format he gives -- including journaling, writing things down and answering questions -- that brought connections between my own life stories, events I'd remembered for years as unconnected separate incidents that somehow had something to do with why I am who I am today.<br />Life (mine anyway) has been an unfinished puzzle.  This book helped me find some more missing pieces, and place a huge chunk of the ones I had into the correct places. My own puzzle may never be finished, but working with this book made me want to yell &quot;Aha!&quot;<br />The only warning might be not to attempt this totally alone unless you have a good therapist, a 12 step program, good friends or whatever support system works for you.<br />Good stuff, hard work, enlightening and most helpful.	2002-06-06

Harry Potter is the closest I've found to a fairy tale that grown-ups will enjoy, but with this book (and others by this author) I've found a delicious fairy tale for the hungry adult reader.<br />This truly is a fairy tale for grown-ups.  It begins, &quot;There was once a young man who wished to gain his Heart's Desire.  And while that is, as beginnings go, not entirely novel (for every tale about every young man there ever was or will be could start in a similar manner) there was much about this young man and what happened to him that was unusual, although even he never knew the whole tale of it.&quot;<br />There's a bit more to the story than that, and it isn't quite as simple as we're led to believe.  Young Tristan Thorn from the village of Wall sets out with a mission and a certain amount of mystery about himself (that we're let into early on, if we pay just the slightest bit of attention).<br />Like Gaiman's hero in Neverwhere, Tristan is a good-hearted young man with the best of intentions.  He promises to leave the village of Wall, where he has lived his whole life, to bring back a fallen star for the woman he loves -- in exchange, she will grant whatever he wants (which is, of course, marriage as he is a charming Prince type guy, the kind you find in fairy tales.)<br />What seems a somewhat simple adventure twists and turns into much more. Medevial times, fairies, unicorns, the moon, bad people (male and female) lead our hero on an exciting adventure and in the end he gets what he doesn't even know he wants.<br />This is a gentle fairy tale for adults by an excellent storyteller.	2002-06-06

The Gods Must Be Crazy....<br />When I picked this up, I vaguely thought it was some kind of murder mystery -- I read the back, which said something about man just released from prison finding out his wife has been murdered.<br />That's only the beginning of a long and delicious story told by a master storyteller.  A mixture of a hip road trip across America, along with magical rides with mystical creatures, the eternal external and internal battle 'twixt good and evil, Christlike sacrifice and suffering, human and godly greed, wit, trickery, violence, poetry and much more.<br />Set in the US in our time, the main character, Shadow, looks forward to reuniting with his wife Laura after serving 3 years in prison. Instead, he  finds out she's been killed in an accident.  He's released early and flies home next to a man named Wednesday, who knows everything about Shadow and shows up in the most unexpected places until Shadow agrees to be sort of a bodyguard to Wednesday.  He has dark and mystical dreams; the lovely, but slowly decaying Laura, pays him wistful visits.<br />He meets some ancient foreigners as well as some younger and more stylish folks on separate sides of an escalating disagreement.  This is the classic story with a contemporary twist. The old Gods men used to worship and sacrifice for (virgins and the innocent) are battling the new gods humans worship and sacrifice for (time, original thinking and more) -- TV, consumerism and technology.  Gaiman's satire runs deep.  How about a modern goddess named Media -- 'isn't she the one who killed her children?' one god asks.  Another answers &quot;Different woman.  Same story.&quot;)<br />Though it doesn't always help to compare one writer's style with another, there are shades of Stephen King's The Stand with a touch of Bukowski and Kerouac.  Since reading this book, I've read two more of his and am searching for more. All were excellent,  managing to be similar, but very different.<br />Gaiman is clearly a gifted storyteller -- whatever I read by him leaves me wanting to read more.

Innocence once lost means doom, even lucky breaks will do no good for this stubborn girl.<br />Our heroine, a young girl living in poverty during the 1700's in the slums of London lives a life that is predictable and drab. She goes to school for an inexplicably long time (given her gender and the family's poverty in those times). At 13, when other girls would be working or wed, she hasn't learned a bit of her mother's trade (piecework seamstress).<br />Mary keeps going to school, though she does sneak over and watch the streetwalkers, one of whom has a beautiful bright red ribbon tied in her hair. Mary has no intent of being a prostitute, but she does expect to have a better life than that of her mother, step dad or baby half-brother. She daydreams about someday returning to this sad part of London with fine clothes and a well-to-do husband, though like most very young people, her ideas on how to attain her goal are are unset, vague and dreamy.<br />In her longing for some color in her life (everything is so gray and drab) she asks an old peddler what the cost of a red ribbon is -- it costs more money than her family could ever spare, for they live on the edge of survival. Eventually the peddler convinces her she can have it for a kiss, and here is her undoing, for he takes from her much more than a kiss and leaves her with less than she'd asked for, plus STD and a pregnancy to boot, all at age of 13.<br />As her mother is packing all of the girl's belongings into a shawl and wrapping it up, she tells her \\"We only get one chance in this life, Mary Saunders, and you've just tossed yours away.\\"<br />One less mouth to feed for the family -- two if you count the babe. Mary finds herself suddenly alone, cold and on the streets. She is taken in by a prostitute who helps her as best she can, by teaching her the trade. Mary intends to just make enough to get her on her feet, but of course that is not the way it goes.<br />The story traces her slide into the very unglamorous life of prostitution. She works hard, saving to buy better clothing -- for in her business, the clothes make the woman, and better clothes may be what she needs to get that better life she thinks she deserves.<br />Despite her mother's claim of just one chance, Mary does get two more. The first is her feeble attempt to go straight, as she becomes a temporary Penitent in a Home for Wayward Women and learns a trade -- ironically, as a seamstress, for which she has a real gift.<br />The thought of a long and bland life doesn't keep her for long. She leaves the home, returns to the streets and ends up in more trouble. She escapes to the small rural community her parents escaped from years ago. Her next big chance at redemption comes when she uses her skills as a seamstress and her quick talking to obtain a service job in the home of a childhood friend of her mother's, who has a child, husband and is a dressmaker.<br />She develops a warm relationship with her mistress. A young male servant is enamoured of her. She makes friends with another servant and the work she is doing, though it will not pay until the end of the year, is something she is skilled at and enjoys.<br />But Mary is in a hurry to get that better life. She does not see herself as a lesser being (her mistress' customers treat her like... a servant, something Mary can hardly bear). The young man will never amount to much, and money she learns the ways he knows best is more important to her than building friendships.<br />Mary is still young and very short sighted. Her fall is painful to read, her story both predictable and a mystery -- will she turn her life around, become a talented seamstress and marry well? The questions soon become, how did she get into such a mess, why did she do what she did (the story is based on a true tale of a young girl who murdered her mistress for a dress) and how will young Mary be rescued?<br />This book would bewell read by a discussion group, and at the end of the novel, discussion topic questions are offered. How much of Mary's life was inescapable, given the conditions of people in the time she lived in? What would have had to happen to save her (it seems she had many opportunities)? Was the murder about a dress, or was there more?<br />Don't read it if you are easily depressed or discouraged unless you're reading with a discussion group! If you like the topic, but would prefer an optomistic outlook, I'd suggest you read Moll Flanders instead.be well read by a discussion group, and at the end of the novel, discussion topic questions are offered.

One book is never enough if you're trying to learn even a little Turkish!  But phrase books are a good starting place, and this is a good little phrase book (though not my favorite) -- to carry around.  It has a dictionary in the back, and is divided by category.  Some seem a bit off -- in the socializing area there are invitations to go home with strangers (and a way to say no..but still...) Dining out, drinking, tourist areas, camping, even complaints are briefly covered.<br />This book has details beyond what I hope I'll need in Turkey. Aside from the foods, it offers all the parts of an automobile (including a diagram of the inside of a car) and body parts (no diagram!).<br />Interesting reading -- it has little bits of information that could be useful.  Don't bother with the tape -- there are better ones offered (see other Turkish language book reviews!)	2002-05-16

Listen to what your fellow reviewers are saying about this book! Despite what the title says, without tapes, this is in no way complete!<br />Make sure you ONLY get it if the tapes are available!  As far as I can tell, the tapes are no longer available (checking with book distributors such as Baker and Taylor).  If you have other good books with tapes, you may find this one helpful, but it isn't top on my list.<br />I've been teaching myself Turkish (slowly, painfully but I'm old!) for months and was excited to see this one, 7th of the books I purchased on this topic. Wish I'd skipped this one in favor of the last one I bought(which was the best!).<br />This book is good if you want to be able to take lessons and quizzes (which I do) but is extremely frustrating without the tapes as many of the exercises refer to the missing tapes.<br />Still glad I have it, but it isn't the best around.	2002-05-16

Bright yellow, an inch thick and only about 3 inches by 4 inches in size, it suits my needs!<br />All I wanted with this dictionary was to have a little book to carry around, to supplement the Turkish language books when they miss a verb.  I enjoy 'reading' it, learning sometimes how words are related, sometimes how they are not.  There are words that define families that are wonderful (father's brother, sister's brother, etc.)<br />Evidently (according to the only other legit review of this dictionary) it is out of date -- mine doesn't really appear to be, (how does a language go completely out of date in 20 years?)<br />This dictionary doesn't deal with colloquial phrases (you need a colloquial phrase book for that), but does have a ton of words stuffed in.<br />A supplement to my collection, this book is just fine though perhaps it doesn't have all the current catch phrases!	2002-05-16

Over the past few months, as I've struggled to learn a bit of Turkish, books on that topic have filled my shelves and backpack.  Every time I find another one, I add it to my collection.  My addiction to all language books Turkish isn't just based on the delusion that owning a lot of books will automatically give me knowledge.<br />What I've discovered is that one book just won't do it -- (see my other reviews on this topic).<br />Rudimentary books are necessary at first to give you basic phrases you'd need.  Once you find you can count to ten, say hello, good-bye, yes, no, please, thank you, how are you, fine, etc. you'll find a need for deeper understanding, a larger vocabulary and a better understanding of how to put sentences together.<br />In my opinion, this book (the 8th I've bought) is so far the best of those that teach you the language, not just phrases.  It comes with two tapes (you MUST have something to listen to -- pronunciation is essential to get your message across correctly). Although you could get along without the tapes which do not cover all the chapters, dialogues or tests, if you are serious, make sure you get the tapes --  they are extremely helpful.<br />Using this book (in my opinion) works best if you have started with a couple of smaller, basic phrase books, and have a self-forgiving attitude.  Turkish is different from English.  Some parts are easy to learn once you understand the format  -- others are difficult exceptions, difficult to comprehend. This book has helped me understand the tenses that are needed (so I don't have to only use the present tense for everything in my life!)<br />The tests are sometimes offered using words you haven't learned yet -- this is an intentional stretch for your learning curve -- and is a good thing.  I'm pretty sure I've found an error or two in the answers (which is why it is good to have several books and sources on hand).<br />The more I did the lessons and then went back to my basic survivor books, the more I understood, and the more I could say.<br />So far this is the best book I've found -- I suspect the next level requires lessons with real people, which is where I'm headed!<br />Excellent for the mid to advanced learner!<br />Iyi talih!ks, the more I understood, and the more I could say.<br />So far this is the best book I've found -- I suspect the next level requires lessons with real people, which is where I'm headed!<br />Excellent for the mid to advanced learner!  <br />Iyi talih!	2002-05-16

Add a dictionary and a language course or two, and how happy you may be!<br />Now, I only wanted to know the present, past and perhaps a bit of the future -- this gave me more than I needed or understood! It would have been helpful (for us low-brows) if it offered translations by tense. It gives the translation for the verb, but you're on your own to sort out Aortist/Present, Present Progressive, Future, Definite Past, Indefinite Past, Necessity, Opative (Subjunctive), Conditional and Imperative.  Then again, it gives you an opportunity to research these tenses on your own.<br />See notes by other reviewers - this book is evidently best for American English speakers.  In addition, a reader from Scandinavia points out that there are needed definitions for some of the verbs (some do not match exactly the American translation).	2002-05-16

He's a big MacDonald's supporter, a fan who begs to eat there on special occasions. And so he stepped up to defend them when he overheard a conversation I was having with someone about this book.<br />&quot;Who is the person who wrote this book?&quot; -- he demanded.<br />&quot;Where did he get his information?&quot;  he looked scornful.<br />&quot;What proof does he have?&quot;  (my son, the detective)<br />and last<br />&quot;What is he getting for saying these things?&quot; my son, the cynic.<br />All good questions, and more than most of us ask about the principles, practices and food sources of fast food restaurants.<br />You'll find the answer to my son's questions in the book -- this is a well researched, well documented and fairly presented study of the fast food industry in America.  The author targets no particular chain of restaurants, but presents us with questions we need to ask before blindly stuffing ourselves and our families with fast food.<br />Eric Schlosser covers how employees are handled, not just at the restaurants themselves but at companies whose main income is comes from supplying these chains with what they need.  He focuses on the meat industry, from ranchers to the migrant workers in the slaughterhouses.<br />His writing on the actual handling of the beef from birth to death requires a strong stomach.  I'd like to point out that we didn't become vegetarians after reading this, 'though we gave some serious thought to it.  Instead,  the next hamburger we ate was homecooked, the meat from a company who handle beef in a different way -- all because of  this book.<br />Schlosser talks about the people who work in the restaurants, what they are expected to do and how their treatment can affect consumers.  He  explores the reasons why fast food workers are not paid enough to survive (employees used to be mostly high school kids, housewives and the retired, who are looking for supplemental living -- but  many employees are now men and women needing to support a family.)<br />His documentation of common management practices light up some painful realizations about what life is like for the workers along the line.  Money saving practices are used to cut paying workers 'too much' -- although the cuts are being made into salaries and benefits  where there is little money to give.<br />I personally love reading about (in other books, too) stories of Americans who had a dream -- the founders and early promoters of fast food chains usually came from humble beginnings, taking an idea that was theirs, using their own hard work, smart minds and taking use of technical improvements to make their visions and dreams come true. Most of us have bought the fast food industry's promotional pitch -- they really love us, they do it all for us, they are a great place to work, and they are still just folks like us, taking pride in their dream coming true.<br />This book made me wonder if it hasn't all gotten out of hand, if perhaps we've forgotten that those small dreams are now mega-businesses, not small family businesses, and that if these dreams of old were dreamed today, they would be dreams that could not so easily come true.  There is little argument that today's business practices result in more profit for top of the line execs, and less pay, benefits or concerns for the seemingly interchangeable frontline workers.  The only arguments these days are about whether this is a good thing, a bad thing, or just the way things are.<br />Schlosser presents information so we can reach our own conclusions.  Of course it leans toward the humane side, rather than the profit margin side.  This book isn't just talking about the quality of the food, but the quality of life for most of us.<br />I especially liked the end of the book -- where most leave you wondering, in frustration and hopelessness,  what to do, heoffers steps to take to begin to cause some change.<br />An easy, but painful read!do, he offers steps to take to begin to cause some change.<br />An easy, but painful read!	2002-04-23

Reading history made into fiction can be quite disappointing, especially when the authors aren't &quot;established&quot; (mainstream) fiction writers. We read this book to see if we wanted to stock it in our bookstore; we prepared for a long and difficult experience.<br />Turns out the only difficulty was in having to put it down to tend to daily chores.  The story of Jane and her 7 children, escaping from slavery when she finds out her two oldest sons are about to be sold, was fascinating.<br />It is the story and details that will capture your interest, though the writing is fine.  Told from multiple views -- most from Jane's thoughts and concerns, her oldest daughter's journal, one of her son's letters two decades later, the slavehunters actions and the beliefs of the abolitionists -- you will never be bored.<br />In fact, there were times when we slowed our reading because we didn't want the story to end, but more often, there were times we just couldn't stop reading.<br />More than just a runaway story, Jane's story is that of a middle aged woman, leaving the only life she's ever known.  To attempt to escape means to be aware of the consequences if captured -- especially difficult when you are making the choice not just for yourself, but for your children.<br />Jane's children -- ages 25 to 9 -- are brought into a new awareness of their mother's courage and that of her first husband, sold away from the family long ago.<br />For those of us who don't know a lot about slavery, this book offers an educational experience that is only painful as we realize what slavery must have been like, and wonder what we would have done had we lived back then.<br />There were slaves who risked their lives to rescue other slaves (without finding their own freedom); there were people who thought slavery was wrong, but did nothing to protest it since it was a way of life; there were folks who turned others in for money or just because they thought slavery was right; there were those who gave their lives because they knew slavery was wrong. Readers can't help but wonder - &quot;how courageous would I have been?&quot;<br />This might be good reading for older children -- high school level -- but be aware there are some very graphic descriptions of slave treatment that will be disturbing to any reader.<br />Also includes photocopies of the ads slavehunters placed with the bounty on Jane and her children, plus maps of the route they followed.<br />Be sure to read Henry Burke's introduction, a too short tale of his childhood and life  -- it is as fascinating as the fiction story.those who gave their lives because they knew slavery was wrong.

It is complex, but not impossible (you'll need to learn to say &quot;Please speak slowly!&quot; or &quot;Please repeat that!&quot;<br />To understand the language you'll need to listen to someone speaking Turkish, slowly and repeatedly.

This book was my last resort in trying to put some order in my life.  Now that I'm not working, there's no personal assistant to follow me around, reminding me of appointments, locating lost papers and plane tickets, or just generally tidying up around me.  Trying to get organized, I'd tried a Palm Pilot, a Franklin Planner, promises, prayers, New Year's Resolutions and was seriously considering electroshock therapy.<br />When I recently gave up my busy work life to come a work-at-home mom, I thought one of the results would be a neat and organized home.  My excuse for a more than slightly disorganized home was that, as a full-time traveling working single parent, two dogs, two cats and a tank full of fish, I was just too busy. My fantasy was that more time at home would cure that.<br />It didn't -- if anything, my disorganization seemed to expand to fit the free time. Worse, even with all the free time, without spending much time on housework, I never seemed to be able to find the time to do a lot of things I wanted to do. My shelves were filled with home craft materials, but even if I had the time to spend on a project, I couldn't seem to locate what I needed.<br />But when my fourth grader's teacher told me he was the most disorganized child she'd taught in 7 years, and then showed me his desk overflowing with papers, books and homework assignments completed but never turned in, I realized something had to be done. I was training him to live in CHAOS (Can't Have Anyone Over Syndrome).  Visions of my son in the future, opening his high school locker only to be buried alive, prompted me to find a solution for him -- which meant I needed to lead by example.<br />And so -- since nothing else had worked --  I ordered the book, and dubiously started to read it.  Skeptically I forced myself to buy some index cards and filled them out (a rather simplistic and foolish notion, I thought).  Feeling silly, I began following the instructions (I skipped over the somewhat goofy stories the sisters tell).  Slowly my life began to get more organized.<br />At this point, my house is consistently tidy.  My Christmas presents -- some home made -- are finished, wrapped and sent.  Instead of taking up all my precious free time, being organized has given me more free time, and some peace of mind.  Best of all, my son (whose homework still gets left behind sometimes) is helping with chores (without being ordered to do so) and working on being better organized.<br />Despite being so simple -- or perhaps because it is so simple -- this system really works for me.

I didn't realize this until I was in Istanbul trying to do my homework.<br />There's a short dictionary in the back of this book, but it is Turkish to English (which makes it hard to look up some of the words you're supposed to translate from English to Turkish - and some words just aren't there).<br />The CD tape I bought simply wasn't enough, so I added this book.

Series 1)	Books	5	37	37	N	N	A 20TH century Quaker  mystic speaks	This tiny book -- 71 pages, including the appendix -- is just right for someone who wants to learn about this 20th century  Quaker mystic or someone who wants to carry around tidbits from his books (A Testament of Devotion; The Eternal Promise; Reality of the Spiritual World)  and letters to his wife, Lael Kelly.<br />Chapters include thoughts on praying, as well as reflections on a spiritual marriage, on amazing people he met in Germany during a visit in 1938, on &quot;running away into God,&quot; on &quot;holy obedience&quot; and so much more, all stuffed into this little book.  The only down-side I can find is that it leaves you longing for more, and so wanting to read more of his works (Testament of Devotion is highly recommended.)<br />In Special Concerns (to be found in the aforementioned book) Kelly writes &quot;We have tried to discover the grounds of social responsibility and social sensitivity of Friends.  It is not in mere humanitariansm.  It is not in mreer pity.  It is not in anything earthly.  The social concern of Friends is grounded in an experience -- an experience of the Love of God and of the impulse to saviorhood inheart in the fresh quickenings of that life.  Social concern is the dynamic Life of God at work in the world, made special and emphatic and unique, particularized in each individual or group who is sensitive and tender in the leading-strings of love. A concern is God-initiated, often surprising, always holy, for the Life of God is breaking through into the world.  Its execution is in peace and power and astounding faith and joy, for in unhurried serenity the Eternal is at work in the midst of time, triumphantly bringing things up unto Himself.&quot;<br />Kelly repeatedly states that there is that of God in everyone (a basic to Quaker beliefs, and strongly states that what believers need is not so much the Bible as the Living Word - all of which softens some of what this liberal Friend finds a bit close to conservative Quakerism.<br />All that aside, this is a lovely book.  This pocket-sized book also includes a small autobiograph of Kelly, who was born near Chillicothe, Ohio in 1893 and died in 1947 just as he'd begun to compile a short book that would contain some of his speeches and lectures.<br />Here is that book -- if you are interested in Quakerism, especially fairly recent writings, this is a good choice as a place to begin./>All that aside, this is a lovely book.

My 10 year old found this book a little boring for the first few chapters, but then liked it a lot.<br />The narrator, Crash, is a jock.  He tells us his story of life in Pennsylvania, with an  irritatingly friendly dorky neighbor, Penn.  They meet in first grade, and although Penn tries to be a good buddy, Crash spends most of his time avoiding or making fun of this skinny, odd boy with second hand store clothing, a pet turtle, strange eating habits (no meat???), ancient parents and no toys.  Penn isn't bothered by any of this, nor by Crash's love of tackle football, designer clothing and social status.<br />Over the years (we stay with them through 7th grade) Crash finds a cool friend, Mike, who really likes tormenting Penn.  Penn never resists, and refuses to fight back for he is a Quaker.  Crash loves his granddad, Scooter, who moves in with the family and comes to Crash's games (his parents are too busy working to provide the family with all the things the family 'needs') -- Penn has a great great grandfather who means a lot to him.  That seems to be about all the two boys have in common, other than the ability to run faster than any other kids in their class.<br />When the Penn Relay brings Penn's 80-something year old great grandfather to town, Crash finds himself in the surprising situation of wondering if he should help Penn win a place in the race, or if he should just leave him in the dust and take the place in the race himself (as he knows he can.)<br />Penn's Quaker beliefs, other than his niceness and refusal to fight, are not covered, leaving the uninformed reader to think that Quakers are about being passive, not eating meat, wearing old clothes and refusing to defend oneself -- of course, all that may be true, but not of all Quakers!<br />Anyway, this is really the story of Crash and how he slowly comes to truly see Penn, Mike -- and even himself - as the people they are.  We enjoyed reading it --  my son (who is not a vegetarian, and says he hasn't decided yet if he's a Quaker) rooted for Crash and laughed at some of the mean jokes at first, but eventually explained to me why Crash had changed at the end.<br />You'll need to read this yourself to find and discuss your own reasons why!le they are.

Series 3)	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Good book in a small package!	I got this book, inspired by reading The Red Tent.  Although it has writings about people who lived long after that wonderful book, the Desert Fathers and Mothers seem to be descendants of those depicted in the Old Testament.<br />  It starts off with the solitary Andrew (circa 241 - 356 AD), whose wisdom was sought by many (&quot;Who will not lie after the commission of a sin, through the wish to escape notice?  As we would not commit carnal sin while we are looking at one another, so if we record our thoughts as though about to tell them to one another, we shall more easily keep ourselves free from vile thoughts through shame.  So let what we write take the place of the eyes of our fellow hermits.  Then blushing as much as if we had been caught, we may never think of what is unseemly.)<br />There is the story of Maria and Abraham, niece and uncle.  An orphaned Maria grew up in the desert praying and learning Scripture, but was seduced by a monk. She fled to the city where she became a prostitute -- Abraham searched for her for two years, found her and -- well, you can read the story in the book.<br />Also stories of the Two Wise Women (yes!), a monk named Maria, more stories on monks (Abbas) and chapters with advices on prayer, judging others and the goal of discipline.  These read much like little stories, and remind me very much of stories told in Sufi Tales.<br />Very good book in a very small package!	2001-08-15

But although quite different from the other novel, this is also a story to tenderly love, especially if the reader is a 50-something woman who's made significant mistakes and has often been confused by love, intimacy and family life.<br />At 20, Kathleen fled to London, leaving her dysfunctional family in Ireland.  Her distant mother, left behind, with a string of young children, abandons everyone by dying too young, while pregnant.  Her father remarries a woman who has no love for any of the children. Sister Nora goes to New York; brother Dan finds solace in drinking but also with his own loving wife and daughter. The youngest child dies of a blood disease.  Kathleen is left alone, on her own, separate from the loveless life of the de Burca family.<br />Of course, as she later comes to realize, one never really freely escapes; the attachments and lessens learned from home can follow you forever.  She manages to create in her own life a detachment from almost everyone.  In her search for love and approval, she destroys her first deep relationship while still in her early 20's.  She can't seem to shake off her notion that sex and love are connected, that the former will lead her to the latter. Through her 20's, 30's and 40's she's found it impossible to turn down advances from men who find her very attractive, but not suitable for a long term relationship.<br />She retreats to a basement apartment and a job that requires her to travel from place to place.  She alienates herself from her best female friend,  from her boss, and from most of her living family but attaches herself into a safely distant friendship with a gay American coworker. When he suddenly drops dead of a heart attack, she is left alone, feeling totally rootless.<br />The novel follows her search for some connection in her life.  She turns to the safety of writing about people who lived long ago -- that of an English woman married to an Irish lord who divorces her for adultery.  Within the novel, she semi-retires from her job as a travel journalist, goes to Ireland and tries to research and write her own interpretation of what 'really' happened -- but the story changes as she gets more information.  She identifies with the woman, and somewhat desperately folds her own hunger for passion into the novel she's writing (making this around the time of the Potato Famine, when many of the Irish starved to death gives us a painful parallel.)<br />Along the way she semi-settles into the life of an Irish family and an aging librarian (managing to stay distant yet feel close), reattaches a little with her brother and his family, and meets and falls in love (through a physical encounter)  with a married man, Shay, who falls in love with her, too.  In a very true and familiar story for many single women, Shay wants to enjoy their love without disrupting his life with his wife, daughters and grandchildren.<br />The novel within the novel is only slightly distracting toward the end, as Kathleen tries to twist it to fit her own needs (when the evidence is pretty clear about the true story).  It would be artificial, I am afraid, to think that at 50, she will radically change, but hope is left at the end that she's heading to some acceptance of herself, of her age, of her life as she has made it (not all bad, not really).<br />Not a light read, very introspective.  I loved Kathleen because she is so much like me -- a cynical romantic (can there be such a thing), ever hopeful and yet practical, imperfect, packed with mistakes and flaws, some painfully obvious to others, some painful to herself, and yet ultimately, lovably human.<br />Not for everyone, perhaps best for the empathetic imperfect reader!painfully obvious to others, some painful to herself, and yet ultimately, lovably human.<br />Not for everyone, perhaps best for the empathetic imperfect reader!	2001-08-15

Weasel eventually drops out of school -- Mongoose has found a strange blue card that opens up a world he hadn't even dreamed of...<br />Sonseray lives in a car, with his uncle.

Her life evolves around her favorite shows -- until one week, when she has to participate in her school's Great TV Turnoff.  How will she ever survive?  That blue card pulls her so far away from the television, she may never return.<br />And April Mendez, who loves to read.

Most of what I read is nonfiction -- it isn't often I find a novel that holds my interest, let alone one that I don't want to put down.  But this story, pulled from the Old Testament's Genesis (the one with the seemingly endless list of begats) was fascinating.<br />Another reviewer here bemoaned the neglect of any mention of \\"God\\" -- in truth, God is woven into the fabric of this story (often spoken of as EL) without a bit of proselytizing.  This story personalizes half the book of Genesis (25 - 50), making it vibrant, rich and fascinating to believers and non-believers alike.  Although religion is a central part of the lives of the men and women we meet, the entire story takes place in a time when most are just beginning to consider giving up their beliefs in a multitude of gods and goddesses for the one God of Jacob's father.<br />Written in the first person, it gives voice to the lives of women, so neglected in the Old Testament. The story leads us through Dinah's life from before it begins to after it ends.  She tells us the stories her mother and aunts (the most well-known being Rachel and Leah) told each other and her as she grew up.<br />As the only daughter in a family of 12 sons, Dinah has privileges most girls don't have.  She is allowed into the Red Tent, the only place men do not go, and where the women go during their menses or when birthing.  She also shares the daily life and rituals of her tribe, with special attention to the lives of the women.  Childhood, adolescence, menstruation, weddings, worship of gods and goddesses, married life, childbirth, mothering, cooking, homelife, friendship, and death are all part of Dinah's life, along with passion and drama.  Dinah becomes a skilled midwife, and is highly valued wherever she goes....<br />Anita Diamant is a wonderful writer, historian and storyteller. Her Dinah invites the reader into the story in such a friendly, familiar way that you will find yourself eager to hear more of her tales, and reluctant to let them end.

This tiny little pocket book seems a bit overpriced at first -- but it isn't something you read and then put away.  This is a book to carry with you, and to read again and again. (Note:  we made a small cloth book cover for this book to make sure it will last longer!)<br />This book is more of an inspiration than documentation (in the back there is a list of the sources used), but then if every quote had a reference number attached to it, this would no longer be a truly &quot;pocket-sized&quot; book.<br />As the introduction, by the Dalai Lama, says:  &quot;Every major religion of the world has similar ideals of love, the same goal of benefitting humanity through spiritual practice, and the same effect of making their followers into better human beings.  As this book shows, the religious teachers wanted to lead people away from paths of misdeeds caused by ignorance and introduce them to paths of goodness.&quot;<br />And even beyond that, this book shows that beneath the surface differences between religions, there is a unifying message.  If we all could accept this connection, and not argue about the really insignificant external differences, individuals might attain enlightenment, and the world might find peace.<br />Under each category &quot;Blessed are the Peacemakers,&quot; for example, there are first some thoughts on that topic, followed by short quotes from major world religions:  Christianity (Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God); Islam (Shall I tell you what acts are better than fasting, charity and prayer? Making peace between enemies are such acts; for enmity and malice tear up the heavenly rewards by the roots); Hinduism (The nobleminded dedicate themselves to the promotion of peace and the happiness of others--even those who injure them); Buddhism (When righteousness is practiced to win peace, he who so walks shall gain the victory and all fetters utterly destroy) ; Judaism (How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good tidings, who publishes peace).<br />Until that happens (before we blow each other up or destroy the planet) this little book will offer much peace and joy to those who read it.e feet of him who brings good tidings, who publishes peace).<br />Until that happens (before we blow each other up or destroy the planet) this little book will offer much peace and joy to those who read it.	2001-08-02

Hannah -- Nanny to her family -- is an 8 year old Quaker girl, living in Pennsylvania in the days of the the Underground Railroad. She loves pretty things -- ribbons or flowers on bonnets; pantaloons with lacy edges; colorful sashes wrapped around dresses. Of course, as plain folks, her family doesn't approve of these non-functional, showy things.<br />The language is old fashioned -- the family speaks in the old Friends way of using &quot;thee&quot; when addressing family members. Hannah gets into numerous mishaps, and after every one, her parents gently explain to her why she need not have frills to be valuable.<br />Hannah's mother says,&quot;'Thee must wait till thee has learned that the color of the dress doesn't matter, and that pantalettes and sashes do not matter. Thee must learn what thy bonnet stands for. Thee must learn Quaker ways.' Mother patted Hannah's shoulder and told her to sit and think about it.<br />&quot;Hannah thought and thought, but she couldn't quite understand what it all meant. 'Why can't Sally and I wear things the big girls wear? And what does my plain, ugly bonnet stand for?' she wondered. But she was unhappy to have made Mother sad, and when she went downstairs, she hoped she could remember to do everything just as Father wished.&quot;<br />But of course, there is still another temptation or two to surrender to, and the consequences to deal with. Hannah doesn't really understand until the very end of the book, when she is called upon by a runaway slave, whose little boy is sick, to get help. Hannah does this, and much later the woman explains to her how she knew Hannah could be trusted (having to do with the wearing of a plain bonnet.)<br />The story, written in the 1940's, is based on stories the young Marguerite de Angeli (b. 1889, d. 1987) heard from an 80-year-old Friend of hers, Hannah Severn. Illustrations are quaint, as is the dialogue. A very nice book for Quaker adults or children (kids who today may have some similar contemporary questions about clothing, computers, and other longed for things.)

The truth is, many of us (Baby Boomers, Yuppies, BoBos et al) would like to live a simple life, provided we could still have all the amenities we've grown accustomed to -- cars (but nothing flashy), television (but not cable, of course), movies (art on film), designer clothes (but simple ones), gourmet food (we'll grow the herbs ourselves), computers/Internet access (well, it's just a modern typewriter/telephone and what a research tool!)<br />Savage and his friends claim that the techno life most of us lead is actually simpler than the lives they lead.  In the techno life, we can do away with too much interaction with others.  We separate ourselves with complications.  We can live in virtual reality, paring down the complications (human beings) into abstracts. We can have friends around the world, although we might not know our neighbors names.  We can amuse ourselves, filling our time with fantastic games, entertaining TV, music from around the world.  What's wrong with that?  It may be that life is so short, and we are spreading ourselves so thin, with all the possibilities at our finger tips, we may be missing real life completely.<br />They claim the simple life is actually the more complicated life, with all the mess and difficulties of living in a small community, having to rely on neighbors (who we might not even like) for help, raising our own foods, finding ways to entertain ourselves and our families that might involve planting, sewing, talking, writing, singing, and being in the moment (without the new agey spin to it).<br />Without lecturing, this collection of articles from The Plain Reader newspaper (subscribers are limited to 5,000 in order to keep it small and hand-made) motivates, illuminates and educates us.<br />Although the authors are generally Luddites, Quakers, Mennonites and other plain living folks, living sans TV, Nintendo, radio, daily newspapers, ownership of automobiles, etc., the articles are not judgmental of those of us still living in the consumer world. And let's be honest -- as much as we claim we want the simple life, here we are, you and I, writing and reading reviews, and buying books over the Internet!  We're mentioned in the book, sympathetically.<br />In an interview with Jerry Mander, the Plain editor says, &quot;..but I have never had anyone say to me, 'No, no get away from me.  These issues aren't important to me. I like being a machine.' On the contrary, in every case where I've spoken heart-to-heart about my concerns, they've turned around and said, 'You know, I, too, have a real sense of unease about what I'm doing.  I think I do watch too much television. I do feel controlled by it,' etc.<br /> Now if I were to wag my finger at them, or organize activities to &quot;wake them up,&quot; appealing to their minds, they would simply hold more tightly to their stake in the dominant culture.  When I tell them my fears and failings, I've not had a single person fail to respond.  And so I do believe this is how we're going to reach people.  Our magazine reaches people by dissolving their fear, by encouraging others with what we're doing.&quot;<br />And so this book encourages us, with examples of what the plain folk, some once Bobos like thee and me, are doing.  It almost pains me to read it, for I fall far short of the pure and simple thoughts in here. And yet there's hope -- I may not give up everything, but I can question, and make changes in how I live my life.<br />Mary Ann Laiser writes of The Media-Free Family; Bill Duesing has thoughts on &quot;Leaving Money Behind; and Art Gish speaks of 'Food We Can Live With.&quot;<br />Even if you're not ready to leave it all behind, this is a wonderful book to read. So thought provoking, it may inspire you to question some of what you're doing, what you're allowing your children to do (I'm speaking to myself, here!) and how even small changes can be made.  We bought one copy, but now we need more to pass along!<br />Can be read bit by bit, or at one sitting.  Use a marker, or bookmarks.

This is the first Hornby book I've read - it won't be the last.<br />Written from the view point of a thirty-something working woman, wife and mother, dissatisfied with her life, blaming this largely on her grouchy husband's attitude, this very funny (but not in a Laughing Out Loud way) book really puts a twist on what happens when you do your best to &quot;be good.&quot;<br />Interestingly, you can read it as a light summer read (but you'll certainly be disappointed in the ending).  You can read it alone (but it yearns to be the Topic of Conversation.)  And you'll be wasting your time if you expect it to supply answers for you.<br />In the beginning, Kate Carr tells her husband David she wants a divorce.  She doesn't quite mean it, but it slipped out. Anyway, she can't get much support from her brother and her best friend, or even from a minister she sort of holds hostage.<br />David doesn't beat her. In fact, he is the home maker in the relationship, staying home with their two small children and writing his column, while she (how good can you get?) carries on her medical practice.  In fact, she's the one having an affair, however meaningless it might be to her.  She just isn't satisfied with her life.<br />Somewhere along the line, David has a new age style ephiphany, when he's healed by a Cult of One hippie leader, GoodNews, who soon moves in with the Carrs.  David has a complete turnaround in character -- he acquires all of the behaviors Kate's been wanting him to have.  He is thoughtful, helpful, and honest. He loses the sarcasm and therefore his column, which was based on sarcasm.  He tries to do good -- not just for the family, but beyond the family -- he wants everyone in the neighborhood to add a homeless kid to their family.  He urges his own kids to give up old and new toys.  He tries to mend old family relationships.  Still, this isn't quite what Kate wants -- she finds herself turning snarly, with her liberal values challenged face to face (well, yes she has always wanted to help those who are less fortunate, but not on such a personal level!)<br />The middle part of the book is the funniest.  If you read it, expecting the ending to give you the answer, you'll have missed the point of the book.  There is a bit of dark humor here as the liberal in the family becomes the conservative, and the happy ending that should come when one is Doing Good proves to be difficult to find.<br />The very ending -- the very last sentence -- was a shock to me.  I'd expected an ending with definition, and just as in real life, there isn't one.<br />A book that might be well read and discussed in a group, certainly a book to make you think!yes she has always wanted to help those who are less fortunate, but not on such a personal level!)<br />The middle part of the book is the funniest.

But read this book!<br />When I heard the author on a local (NPR) talk show, I knew this book was one I had to read.  Having been a working, food stamp mother in the 70's, I had hoped for the sake of my own kids that things had changed.<br />One of my late 20's sons, a hard worker, can't seem to get ahead despite a willingness to work two jobs and give up what some of think are basic things in our lives (a home of our own, a spouse and kids, basic TV, three square meals).  For those of us in the family working management jobs or owning our own businesses, we're doing fine.  For those in the family who are blue or pink collar workers, life is not so sweet.<br />My son doesn't whine, but I do see his struggles with anger and depression (no negative results so far, thank God) as he suffers with feelings of inadequacy.<br />This book clearly shows that not only have things NOT gotten better than they were in the 70's, they are getting worse as the haves squeeze more and more from the have-nots.  In the company I retired from, the profit line keeps going up despite the economy.  While working for the same company, in the warehouse, my son's wages somehow never increase although his responsibilities do. What's the problem?  What's the solution?<br />The problem is the same one we've had since the industrial revolution -- or since the lords and the serfs -- power, money, greed and manipulation.  What's the solution?

I've read most of the Left Behind series, fascinated (probably because<br />I'm sure that, given the criteria you need to meet in order to be<br />&quot;Rapturized&quot;, I'd certainly be one of those left behind)<br />with the story of good versus evil.<br /> If you, too, find yourself<br />interested in the Left Behind series, but find the message in the<br />books too preachy, the characters magnificently underdeveloped, and<br />the overall writing rather juvenile, then I highly recommend this<br />book.<br /> You can read many reviews on this book that outline the<br />story -- all we can add here is a testimony that this is our favorite<br />Stephen King book. Where Left Behind takes the Bible's Revelation and<br />interprets it literally, this book goes to the heart of the<br />message.<br /> It begins as a sudden severe epidemic wiping out many<br />people, do-gooders and bad boys alike, regardless of race, creed, age,<br />gender, political affiliation, religion, IQ or physical condition. No<br />explanation is ever given (nor needed) for why some survive.  But<br />survive they do. Left behind is a small percentage of the world's<br />population (we assume, although this is all based stateside), from<br />several walks of life.<br /> We meet the survivors and watch as they are<br />drawn toward one of two polar leaders -- Miss Abigail, a 108 year old<br />black Christian or the Dark Man, Randall Flagg.  Individuals on each<br />side unite to win.<br /> Seekers of the good (a very left-wing liberal<br />bunch of folks) head toward Boulder, Colorado. The dark side is<br />home-based in Reno, Nevada. A very American story, we don't learn what<br />is happening in other nations -- (then again, we do think we're the<br />center of the world!) This book is in places a most unpleasant<br />read. Flagg is the epitome of evil, seemingly the reincarnation of<br />Adolf Hitler and every other mad leader the world has known, making<br />examples of captured enemies by placing their heads along the road, or<br />disemboweling them.<br /> The story transcends into the ultimate battle<br />between good and evil, externally and internally. Readers can take<br />their position (of course those of us who read it would be a survivor,<br />just as in the Left Behind series we'd be one of the unsaved souls<br />left on earth) and identify with the well-developed<br />characters. Together we can ask ourselves, if good triumphs in a<br />battle, is evil is gone forever? History contains the answer!<br /> Yes,<br />this book is lengthy. The original version was long, and King has<br />added much more. Think of this as the entire Left Behind Series, in<br />one book -- only better.<br /> This is a book that will take some time<br />to read, but is hard to put down!il, externally and internally.

Life for the slightly neurotic, modern thirty something single girl in  London is not easy. This novel, recommended by my son, is funny, and  had me in tears (laughter and some kind of common female bonding thing).  Bridget worries about her weight, her health and her love life. Her  mother (who is going through a mid-life crisis, leaving her husband for  a man named Julio) tries to fix her up with a man who wears a patterned  sweater, but Bridget and her boss are in the midst of a torrid e-mail  flirtation.<br />  Hope they make a movie of it! Good for fun reading. I bought this book while on a holiday in London, stayed up all  night when I should have been sleeping my way through jet lag!

This sequel to Bridget's Diary is as good as, if not better than, the first and has me thoroughly addicted to the relationship-challenged thirty-something London-er.<br />In the beginning of this book, Bridget has good friends, a boyfriend (finally!), a decent job, and a nice flat in London. But Bridget, being Bridget, finds herself in the midst of a feud with a good friend (who is moving from Singleton into life as a Smug Married by planning to wed Vile Richard), minus a boyfriend (evidently captured by the awful Rebecca, an absolutely perfect slim and trendy blonde with no qualms about stealing someone's man).<br />Her mother's off with yet another foreign man, Gary the contracter has left a huge hole in one of Bridget's apartment walls, her dream job comes with an insane boss, the weight goes up, the weight goes down and that relaxing exotic vacation ends up more like Midnight Express than Stella Finds Her Groove.<br />Relying on all the self-help books she owns (and she owns them all), Bridget still struggles, crashes and burns.  Her life is humorous largely because it is strangely familiar to single women (of all ages).  Her wants, desires, and worries are universal to women of all ages and time periods -- the books are modern-inized versions of Pride and Prejudice and Persuasian.<br />Read them both, then join those of us who are waiting for the next book (and the movie and the tube version).	2000-12-08

If you like excellent writing and an intriguing plot with a socially  conscious (NOT BORING) message, please read this  book. Don't just read it -- buy it if you can and help  support and encourage this author. This first novel should  be on the mainstream bestseller list. This is history, science  fiction, fantasy, social commentary and ecology all bundled into one.<br />  In 2043, an American woman makes a one way trip into the Shopshire, England of the 1700's, to  alter the building of a bridge. Doing so may save us all. The story gives  several views. There is that of the woman, Maggie Foster, as she lands  naked in the middle of an earthquake, then must find a place to live and learn  the culture of the times. There is the viewpoint of John Wilkerson,  swordsmaker and local entrepreneur who is trying to enforce the building of  the bridge in iron, to further his own profits. The person Maggie must  persuade to alter his construction of the bridge is a Quaker, Abraham Darby,  who is torn between a wish to do what is right or what he'd like.<br />  There is a lot of detail about iron and bridge building that some may find  interesting -- we skipped over that to read about life in the 1700's, to follow  Maggie's romances, to see her struggle to persuade the gentlemen of that  period that her opinions count, and to watch her try NOT to make any  changes in people's lives -- for if you change one thing in the past, no matter  how small, you can alter the future in strange ways.<br />  More of a romance and period piece than science fiction, it is well-written  and fascinating to read. Some Friends should be advised that John  Wilkerson's lifestyle is less than pure, and given in some detail, and that some  of Maggie's experiences are less than conventional, and given in some detail,  including her romance with Darby's sister.<br />  Will she be able to alter history without changing people's lives in 1790? Will  that be enough to delay the Industrial Revolution? And if so, will a delay  really make a difference in saving the environment for the future?<br />  Read and find out.

We came across this book quite by accident, when looking for something else (we've forgotten what!) in the self-help section of a local bookstore.  It seemed to jump off the shelf at us!<br />You don't have to be a monk to read this, or follow it.  The writing is down to earth, and follows a seeker's experience with the monks who broke away from their original Franciscan monastery in the mid 1960's, to form their own.  This is no easy feat! They were led by the belief there is meaning in eastern christianity (fundamentalists or traditionalists will find this book too liberal for their liking).  Indeed, their monastery had room for brothers and sisters, living a celibate spiritual life.<br />There is much beauty and substance in this book -- we only wish it were available in paperback, to make it more accessible to more people.<br />If you are wondering how to live a spiritual life every day, if you would like to be monklike, but have responsibilities that keep you in the worldy life, do not despair! This book is something that can help you, and uplift you, in a down-to-earth yet uplifting way!	2000-11-27

We want to convince you to buy this calendar, for yourself, for a friend, for your mother, sister, daughter (and perhaps even your husband).<br />This calendar speaks to many conditions -- for older women, it shows us how beauty comes from within, and that we can and should be considered 'calendar girls'of the highest quality. For younger women, it teaches us that beauty does not fade with age, just changes as our bodies do.<br />The ordinary British ladies who posed for the photos in this calendar did so to raise money for leukemia -- what started as a 'silly' idea blossomed into a very successful campaign.<br />The photos are wonderfully droll, showing women at work in the home, doing everyday things -- just in the natural state (with the addition of pearls, all a lady really needs!)<br />This is a wonderful gift for a woman going through the 'change' -it embraces the sexuality of the aging female in a wonderful way for those of us who found turning 50 to be a shocking disappearing act.  We are alive and well, thank you! And proceeds go to help leukemia in Britain.<br />Absolutely best calendar of the year!	2000-11-15

A beautiful photo is the cover for this book containing short stories of Buddhist &quot;acts of compassion.&quot; (Although, as the introduction explains, Buddhism does not contain separate acts of compassion, but IS a flow of universal connectedness.)<br />In this book are stories from many different schools of Buddhism, each supporting the belief that prayer, faith and compassion make life peaceful and miraculous in a simple manner.<br />The stories are short, and deceptively ordinary. (Lama Choedak Yuthok tells of an American husband who divorces his wife in order to become a Buddhist monk, and of her loving acceptance; Julia Russell shares a story of how a lonely, angry schoolchild finds love and acceptance because of very simple acts of kindness from her teacher and schoolmates; a gay man finds that changes in his own life have caused a major change in someone else's life.)<br />But they tell of how living your beliefs will have strong effects in the lives of many. In between the short stories are words of wisdom from many Buddhist teachers.  At the end there are Meditations for Developing Compassion with little explanations of Metta Practice (&quot;living-kindness, a..meditation..used to cultivate..a calm, concentrated mind&quot; and &quot;the quality of loving-kindness itself.&quot;)  Tonglen meditation is also explained, a Tibetan practice for taking on the pain and suffering of others.<br />A nice book of encouragement and example, (not an instruction manual), very good for those who are just becoming interested in Buddhism.	2000-11-08

Holding on to (hiding) our dark side is what keeps us from moving forward and making significant changes in our lives.  Can't: get rid of the excess weight, stop ruining good relationships, getting into bad ones?  You just might want to take a look at this book, find that dark side and use it to set you free.<br />One way to spot the dark side, according to Debbie Ford, in her excellent book, is to pay attention to our over-reactions. If you find yourself getting all worked up when someone accuses you of being something you just KNOW you're not, Ford tells us that that reaction means you're right on top of some important information.<br />You could go into psychotherapy to try and work it out. Or you could just get this book, and start embracing the darker side. You won't fall apart -- read it, do the exercises.  This is a book you can read and follow alone, but it's also an excellent  book to work on, or discuss, with a good friend or two.<br />Don't pass this one by, unless you're perfect!	2000-11-06

Instead, we browsed through it at a very large, library like bookstore.  The look and feel of the book made it difficult to put back on the shelf. Indeed, we found that this thick book was a feast of words, containing hundreds and hundreds of quotes - 1,600 or so -- on topics having to do with virtue: happiness, courage, compassion, purity, perseverance, courtesy, faith, goodness, love, respect, strength, and wisdom.<br />But it proved to be much more than just the usual collection of great quotes, or words of wisdom to look at once in a while, or copy onto websites and into newsletters. &quot;Virtue&quot; when served up by M. Scott Peck goes beyond conventional, dogmatic wisdom that sees goodness as something to be applied externally, and medicinally.<br />Peck thoughtfully reflects on what virtue is, what it means to individuals, how it emerges in each of us, from deep within. Before each section of quotes from a variety of people from different cultures, times, and beliefs, he offers his own reflections and experiences (on light purple paper, so you can easily see where each section begins) about the topic.<br />We love this book because it gives us all those favorite quotes, and some delicious food for thought. For the M. Scott Peck fan (The Road Less Traveled), this book will be a welcome gift (its on MY list to give and get)!	2000-11-03

It's hard when a book you've been reading faithfully every year is made into a movie, and you see who Hollywood gives the lead part to. (Then again, who else would anyone cast in this rubber-faced role?)<br />This is the original story, with the real face of the scowling, mean-spirited Grinch. That  face changes from bad to worse, and then to tender when he finally &quot;gets&quot; the meaning of Christmas.<br />But before he does, children and adults will read (and reread) in delight and shock as the Grinch disguises himself as Santa. The innocent townspeople of Whoville never seem to catch on as the Grinch forces his poor dog Max to help him steal all the toys and ornaments.  He's so sure that once he's done away with the material goodies, the Christmas spirit will be gone.<br />A wonderful story with a message we can't hear enough.  Add this to a child's Christmas bookshelf, or give it to that grumpy coworker who's ba-humbuging around.<br />This book is the classic (accept no substitutes)!	2000-11-01

Why?<br />Although we can find the same poem and pay a lot more, with award winning illustrators, the illustrations provided by Douglas Gorsline are surely the best.  They are quite colorful, and offer details little children love looking into...cats lie sleepily on the window sill, we see an overview of the town, the presents spilling from the open sack are intriguing and plentiful, and Jolly St. Nick is -- well, quite Jolly (as you can see by looking at the cover!)<br />The story is an &quot;abridged version&quot; - I'm not sure about other parents, but we read this on Christmas Eve, and we only have so much time and energy.  Everything we remember from the  classic poem by Clement Clarke Moore is in this version.<br />(From &quot;'Twas the Night Before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse&quot; to &quot;He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,&quot;HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!&quot;  In between we have everything, from the names of  the eight tiny reindeer, to a belly that shakes like a bowl full of jelly, including dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky&quot;.<br />In other words, don't be scared off by 'abridged'!)<br />Perhaps a hardcover edition might be more appropriate if you're giving a gift (unless you're giving to more than one child), but this book is one of the best offers we've found!<br />A classic done simply and inexpensively!	2000-11-01

This book opens the possibility that Santa Claus -- as presented to most of us -- may not physically exist. It does this in a way that will allow children and their parents to ease into that question, a graceful move from the belief in a living St. Nick, to a belief in the spirit of Christmas.<br />It begins like this: &quot;On Christmas Eve, many years ago, I lay quietly in my bed.  I did not rustle the sheets.  I breathed slowly and silently.  I was listening for a sound -- a sound a friend had told me I'd never hear -- the ringing of Santa's sleigh.<br />'There is no Santa,' my friend had insisted, but I knew he was wrong.&quot;<br />From here, we follow a beautifully illustrated story of this young boy's quiet night ride with other children, on the Polar Express train to the North Pole, a &quot;huge city standing alone at the top of the world, filled with factories where every Christmas toy was made.&quot;<br />Our narrator is the fortunate child, picked by Santa, to receive the first gift of that Christmas.  He knows exactly what he wants, a simple gift that will help him continue to believe in the magic of Christmas, a silver bell from a reindeer's harness.<br />He gets his wish, but loses it on the train ride home.  However, there's a happy ending -- evidently Santa has found the bell, and put it under the tree.  The boy and his little sister admire the beauty of the sound it makes, but their parents say, &quot;Oh, that's too bad....It's broken.&quot;<br />Many years later, the boy's sister and all of his friends can no longer hear the bell.<br />&quot;Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe.&quot;<br />My youngest son at ages 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 has chosen to firmly believe with the narrator, but he's moved around in his reaction to the notion that Santa isn't real.  From -- &quot;that's ridiculous, isn't it?&quot; to &quot;Mom...it is ridiculous, isn't it?&quot; This book will let him hold onto the Christmas spirit for as long as he wants, and to return to it whenever he needs it.<br />This version comes complete with CD's/tapes with readings. Buy the less expensive edition, add a silver bell, and (if you can), read it with the child yourself to give a really special gift.<br />A wonderful book for those who want to believe in the spirit of Christmas every day of every year.pirit for as long as he wants, and to return to it whenever he needs it.<br />This version comes complete with CD's/tapes with readings.

This book is a classic, and I think this is because it is a simple story (life on a farm for a talking pig and his friends) with a very deep message about life, death, and the value and connection of all sentient beings.<br />If you read this as a child, you may remember the friendship of poor Wilbur, doomed to die young. You'll recall that he's saved by his brilliant spider friend Charlotte, who weaves words into her web, in a way advertising Wilbur's uniqueness to the farmer and his daughter. You might also remember the goose, the rat and other friends who rally.<br />Read this again as an adult, and you may find there's more to the story.  When I read this story to my oldest child some 25 years ago, I was amazed at his tears at end.  In fact, I'd forgotten that the wonderful Charlotte dies after laying hundreds and hundreds of spidery eggs.<br />Wilbur (and my son) grieved over the 'unfairness' of this, although Charlotte in her wisdom knew that she (like all living beings) was are going to die.  She left her heritage - not just her baby spiders (who 'know' Wilbur, since they were as one with their mother), but Wilbur, whose life she saved.<br />A wonderful story, to be appreciated on many levels as you wish, from the most superficial to a deeper more spiritual one.<br />Hardcover edition has been on our shelves for over 30 years!	2000-11-01

My 9 year old took a look at the face of Jim Carey, as the movie Grinch, and said, &quot;That's not the real Grinch!&quot;<br />He's right, of course.  It's hard when a book you've been reading faithfully every year is made into a movie, and you see who Hollywood gives the lead part to. (Then again, who else would anyone cast in this rubber-faced role?)<br />This is the original story, in a classy cover for the Seuss lover or favorite grandchild(ren) on someone's Christmas list. Of course, as the story tells us, material things aren't as important as the intentions behind them.<br />If the price seems a bit high, amazon offers another version that's a little less expensive and still has the real face of the scowling, mean-spirited Grinch.<br />That face changes from bad to worse, and then to tender when he finally &quot;gets&quot; the meaning of Christmas. But before he does, children and adults will read (and reread) in delight and shock as the Grinch disguises himself as Santa. The innocent townspeople of Whoville never seem to catch on as the Grinch forces his poor dog Max to help him steal all the toys and ornaments.  He's so sure that once he's done away with the material goodies, the Christmas spirit will be gone.<br />A wonderful story with a message we can't hear enough.  Add this deluxe edition (sure to last for another 40 years!) to a child's Christmas bookshelf, or give it to that special someone who's ba-humbuging around.<br />This book is the classic (accept no substitutes)!	2000-11-01

The book opens with the words &quot;Life is difficult.&quot; Once you accept that, it becomes a lot easier!<br />But most of us don't accept that.  We think if we do things the right way, or if other people would, then eventually life would become easier.  Our material needs will be met, love will bloom forever, bad things won't happen to us, and life will unfold according to our individual needs and wishes.<br />Guess again. If you're constantly trying hard and finding life to be a major disappointment, you may find comfort and practical help in the reading and re-reading of this book.<br />Peck writes in an easy to read, easy to understand manner, writing of his life and that of many of his own patients. He begins with a section on Discipline; the next is on Love; then Growth and Religion; closing (how appropriately) with Grace.<br />When first I read this, in my mid-twenties, (living life in what one of my 'friends' called Life in the Breakdown Lane) the sections didn't look like they'd offer anything to help me.  Discipline was something I wanted to act out against, not find solace in.  The section on Love, I was disappointed to find, did NOT provide any instructions on how to find a knight on a white horse.  Growth and Religion seemed some kind of a paradox to me, and I was sure that Grace was nothing more than a name I wished I had.<br />But within those Sections I have again and again(at different levels) found peace of mind through solutions that at first I didn't fully understand, but came to believe in -- for anyone looking for help in improving their lives, from a non-dogmatic, non-fundamentalist point of view, I'd strongly recommend this book.<br />Read it, learn from it, and just as happens to the bunny in the children's book, The Velveteen Rabbit, you'll find yourself becoming more alive, and more 'real.'<br />I'd also encourage the reading of Sheldon Kopp's &quot;If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him&quot; and (if you're looking for some comic relief, always good when stressed) watch &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot;<br />This is truly a gem of a book (though I haven't liked many others of his).ic relief, always good when stressed) watch &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot;<br />This is truly a gem of a book (though I haven't liked many others of his).	2000-10-24

My bookshelves are filled with books on many topics, including death and dying and spirituality -- this book might be the only book I really need.<br />For years I have thought I must read the Tibetan Book of the Dead -- but whenever I tried, it was much too complicated for me to understand.<br />Sogyal Rinpoche has written this book so that it is easily understood by anyone, even us Westerners, without compromising any of the Buddhist teachings it offers.<br />In essence, we begin to die the moment we are born.  We spend this life preparing to die well. Nothing is permanent, but we spend much of our lives filling our time with activities and pursuits that help us elude ourselves into thinking that what we see and touch is all that matters.<br />Sogyal Rinpoche says, &quot;To follow the path of wisdom has never been more urgent or more difficult.  Our society is dedicated almost entirely to the celebration of ego, with all its sad fantasies about success and power, and it celebrates those very forces of greed and ignorance that are destroying the planet.  It has never been more difficult to hear the unflattering voice of the truth, and never more difficult, once having heard it, to follow it: because there is nothing in the world around us that supports our choice, and the entire society in which we live seems to negate every idea of sacredness or eternal meaning.  So at the time of our most acute danger, when our very future is in doubt, we as human beings find ourselves at our most bewildered, and trapped in a nightmare of our own creation.&quot;<br />He writes about the importance of realizing the interconnectedness of all living beings (including nature), of meditation (and gives instructions and advice), of finding and being devoted to a good master (something very difficult for Westerners to accept -- he acknowledges that there are fraudulent ones about), of learning to live and learning to die, of letting go of egos and becoming egolessness.  Throughout the book, he tells of female masters as well as males, something female readers may greatly appreciate.<br />Sogyal Rinpoche is from Tibet, and speaks of the cruelty of the Chinese to the Tibetan Buddhists  (very similar to the persecution of the early christians, and later the Jews by the Nazis -- when will we ever learn, but then that's the point of this book!)<br />In the last section of the book, he speaks of &quot;The Universal Process&quot; which is about spirituality, living and dying of all humans, regardless of race, spiritual beliefs, gender or national origin.  There are in the back two mantras with explanations and he shares  photographs of his beloved masters. Throughout the book are inspiring poems from such poets as Rumi and St. Francis of Assisi, as well as Buddhists.  In the very back he gives suggested readings, and offers phone numbers and addresses of Rigpa National Office, where those who are interested can find referrals to cources and study groups in the US, Canada and around the world.<br />This book is a very good place for the seeker to begin.  For those curious about Buddhism, or seriously interested in becoming a Buddha or a Buddhist, or just looking for more thoughts and information on death and dying, this book is excellent, easy to understand, thought-provoking.book, he tells of female masters as well as males, something female readers may greatly appreciate.  <br />Sogyal Rinpoche is from Tibet, and speaks of the cruelty of the Chinese to the Tibetan Buddhists  (very similar to the persecution of the early christians, and later the Jews by the Nazis -- when will we ever learn, but then that's the point of this book!) <br />In the last section of the book, he speaks of &quot;The Universal Process&quot; which is about spirituality, living and dying of all humans, regardless of race, spiritual beliefs, gender or national origin.

But when I came across this book (at a convention, of all places) it seemed the logical add-on gift.  If I had a grill of my own, I'd have a hard time handing this book over to him!<br />Author and chef Holly Rudin-Braschi promises that this is &quot;Everything you need to know to make delicious, healthy meals on your indoor electric grill,&quot; and she follows through by offering MORE than just the 50 plus recipes.  In the beginning, she offers an &quot;International Pantry Solutions,&quot; listing basic spices, sauces, herbs and condiments for different cuisines (Cajun, Creole, Caribbean, Chinese, French, Greek, Indian, Italian, Japanese, Mexican, southwest, middle eastern, south east Asian).  Toward the back of the book, she offers recipes for meatless grilling -- middle eastern veggie wrap with heavenly hummus, Taj Mahal Tofu Steaks with Pineapple Express Rice and Cucumber Raita Salad.  In the thickest section, in the middle, she gives the reader more traditional meals -- gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches (much improved!), hamburgers from simple to fancy, steaks, chicken, sausage, Texas chili, veal chops and much much more.<br />Throughout this thick, easy to read book, she gives a bundle of useful information, especially good for first time or infrequent cooks. This includes time saving ingredients; instructions on how to make your own Cajun seasoning, dry jerk seasoning mix, how long to marinate meat, chicken and fish, grill times; well composed salads; a chapter on how to grill super steaks, chops and tenderloins, including what to buy, how much you'll have when you're done grilling (4 to 5 oz. of meat becomes 3 to 4 oz. when cooked) grill temperatures and time for different meats and more.<br />[She also does something I've not seen anywhere before - gives recipes for sauces that go in the cups of infusion grills that use a lid, adding extra flavor to the finished food!]<br />For the new or busy cook, the layout of her recipes is excellent.  She starts with the whole menu -- for example, American Apricot Sauced Poultry with Grilled Asparagus over Vermicelli Pilaf.<br />She gives a &quot;Menu Game Plan,&quot; which includes prep and cooking time (50 minutes for this one), instructions in order of time (great for those of us who can't figure out how to get all the dishes ready to serve at the same time).  Next, she offers some Cook's Notes -- in this one she discusses to peel or not to peel the asparagus.<br />The recipe for each dish comes next, and each one is easily viewable (you don't have to turn the page in the middle of cooking). Each recipe includes:<br />Ingredients;<br />Substitutes (if you don't want to use the white wine in this dish, substitute apple cider or apple juice);<br />Step-by-step instructions;<br />Serving instructions<br />Each meal has the Grill Time for different types of grill (Two-Sided Contact Grill; Hibachi Grill, Combination Grill or Infusion Grill).  Her &quot;Mix and Match&quot; section tells you where else you can use some of the dishes -- in this one, the Rice Pilaf can be used for Amazing Maple Glazed Pork Chops on page 115 or Smart and Saucy Rosemary Cherry Lamb Chops on page 119.<br />At the end of each meal section, she offers an approximate Nutrients Per Serving of Entire Meal -- you can simply divide by the number of people/servings to determine the calories, cholesterol, protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, etc.<br /> Highly recommended for anyone who has received a grill as a gift, and really wants to cook! And if you're going to buy a grill for yourself, or as a gift, check this book out first.  In the opening chapter, she says &quot;to write this book, I used just about every electric grill available and discovered that there are four basic styles.&quot;  She goes on to give the pluses and minuses of each kind, a good help in deciding which grill is best foryour needs.<br />A great book for those who want to do more than slap a burger on the grill, with information that carries over to stovetop cooking.rill is best for your needs.    <br />A great book for those who want to do more than slap a burger on the grill, with information that carries over to stovetop cooking.	2000-10-18

This book, too, draws from his personal history, this time as an Italian-American, growing up in a large family in Connecticut. And like his other novels (13th Valley; For All Things Living; Carry Me Home), his characters, plot and writing is so good, you'll keep reading even if your vision of the world is quite different from the author's (note that this reviewer is a bleeding heart liberal pacifist WASP -- Del Vecchio is not)!<br />  This story covers so much that an attempt to explain it in detail may make it sound too complicated.  The writing is so good, it isn't too complicated, but it isn't a quick read.<br />  Del Vecchio writes primarily from the view of Johnny Panuzio, a middle-aged husband and father in the process of being downsized from his job as an advertising executive.  He struggles with a gambling addiction while functioning as  best friend to Mitch (a black coworker), a good husband to Julia (fresh back in the workplace as an executive in a publishing company), a dedicated father to a college-aged son, and a son and daughter in high school, a patient son to Rocco, who lives with the family and is slowly losing his memories.<br />  Add a mysterious death, a love story, corporate game-playing, and some local politics, all touched by a rich Italian-American heritage, and you have a book you won't want to put down.  In addition to Johnny Panuzio's viewpoint, Del Vecchio also offers the reader a view from the murdered high school student (through publications of letters the young man had written), as well as from the views of his teen-aged son and his aging father.  There are flashbacks from Johnny's childhood, as well as a running series of his own &quot;final thoughts&quot;.<br />A good, thick read that will make you think long after you've put it back on the shelf.	2000-10-16

My youngest is 9, and sometimes it seems there are so many things to talk with him about, I don't know where to begin! Parents of young children in the 21st century have to deal with AIDS, the Internet, 24 hours TV (with suggestive commercials that can be an education in and of themselves), violence in the schools, drugs, teen pregnancy, gay families, stepfamilies, not to mention their own choices in their own teen and young adult years.<br />I like this book because it offers a place for discussion between kids and parents to begin, with cute illustrations and questions that prompt some thoughtful conversations.  It suggests that you first ask them what they know about the topic you want to discuss, find out what their friends say and you'll find out what they think, or worry about.<br />The authors suggest you start talking with your preschoolers, so you can set the groundwork for open communications before adolescence sets in. They don't suggest that you tell small children everything, just begin the talk. Although you may think there is time, these days it is very likely that by kindergarten, they are already learning from their peers at school or on the bus -- and some of what they are learning is wrong, some is too much too soon, some may represent values that are totally unacceptable to your family, and much of this may be scary for a young child to hear.<br />There are chapters, questions and illustrations by topic, so you can choose what you want to talk about. Best read the book yourself, first. You might want to think about what your child will ask you (about your past), and how much you'll reveal.<br />A good addition to the family bookshelf after you talk with and listen to your child!	2000-10-12

As you no doubt know, Harry is a wizard in a world of dragons, warlocks, magic spells and battles.<br />  Reasons why Quaker kids should read Harry Potter:<br />* The Harry Potter books are wonderful for getting kids interested in READING.<br />* Most Quaker adults are Muggles, and the books teach kids how to deal with Muggles<br />* There are too few books out that interest boys in reading - the Potter books get boys AND girls interested in reading.<br />* There are too few books out that parents enjoy reading with their kids.<br />* Harry probably has Quaker routes - he's interested in social causes, the rights of the underdog, and general fairness to all.  He even leans toward non-violent solutions to most problems. This book especially touches on the social causes, as Hermione fights for the rights of the House Elves.<br />I have to confess, I found the beginning of this book simultaneously boring (too much Quidditch), and questionable as there was some brutality.  I was also saddened toward the end of this book at a death that could have been better handled.<br />But in the big picture, the sports theme is of interest to boys (girls, too), we can read and talk together, and my son's reading interest has gone up 100% since going through all 4 of these books.<br />The only downsize here is that we don't know what to read until  the fifth book comes out!	2000-10-03

Margaret Atwood continues to write stories that are...well, different, one from the other.  The style in this book is so different from A Handmaid's Tale, or Alias Grace, but as usual, the writing and characters are excellent.<br />The story starts after World War II ends, when Laura, the narrator's younger sister, commits suicide by driving off a bridge.  We are drawn into the story through a series of article clippings about the social life of the surviving sister, Iris; her pompous husband and nouveau riche sister-in-law; and the posthumous publication of Laura's science fiction novel (The Blind Assassin).<br />These articles are tucked between Iris' reflections on her life then and now, along with a running third party story between a woman and her lover, who tells her the original tale of The Blind Assassin.<br />We move back and forth in time, retracing the history of the Canadian sisters from the 1920s to 1999, in a way that makes this novel difficult to put down, a pleasure to return to.  A little mystery, a little steamy romance, some socialism, and sibling rivalry combine to make this book (as with all of Atwood's books) more than just something to read.  Iris, especially, is so human in her old age, her sins are easy to forgive.<br />The ending is a bit of a let down -- I'd figured out most of it before I was halfway through the book -- but the enjoyment of reading and being able to take all the threads and see them come to tie together was well worth the read.<br />A very good read for Atwood fans.	2000-10-03

This book, written by a Quaker psychotherapist with an interest in Sufism and Buddhism, is a treasure for adults (of all ages!) who wonder why dating and relationships are so difficult. This book isn't intended to educate any of us in Buddhism as a faith, but to speak to those who want a fulfilling intimate love relationship.<br />Western culture's view of love -- often a hard-to-fulfill expectation of love-at-first-sight encounter, based on a strong and immediate physical attraction, ending with a happily-ever-after-fairy tale conclusion -- has confused, disheartened and frustrated many of us who just can't make that kind of romance last for long, let alone forever.<br />  This book combines Buddhist, Quaker and Sufi spiritual philosophy to love, helping us clear our minds.  Kasl calls this, &quot;crawling in love,&quot; and says, &quot;When we crawl in love we are more likely to find the true fire of hearts meeting...&quot;<br />  As another reviewer stated, the information in the book is &quot;common sense, nothing original in it at all.&quot;  That comment, I suspect, would make the Buddha laugh.  We have been on earth so long, certainly there is nothing new under the sun to help us with our relationship problems, only old truths we forget as we get caught up our romantic wish for Love American Style.<br />  Kasl reminds us of some simple truths.  Ground yourself in spiritual wisdom, remember the impermanence of everything, learn compassion for yourself and others.  She sites some common themes in Quakerism, Buddhism and Sufism - center yourself, take time to reflect, listen to that still small voice within, and you will be able to accept and give love in a deep, lasting way.<br />  She explores our need for an intimate relationship, in a way that is different from the Mars and Venus approach which focuses more on the differences between men and women, tending to widen the gap.  Unlike Gray's books, and others which direct us to learn how to say and do the 'right stuff' externally, she encourages us to find connect in the spiritual and human similarities we have with each other, and to respond to each other from our genuine selves.<br />  She touches on ads, dating services, the internet, same gender relationships, dating when there are kids involved, physical intimacy, tonglin meditation, and breaking up.<br />  This book absolutely is not for everyone.  The reference to &quot;Christian&quot; spiritual practices on the back cover is misleading, since it actually draws on more liberal, non-dogmatic Quaker practices. If you are more of a Western philospher than an Eastern philosopher, if you would like new ideas spelled out in an easy to follow, guaranteed fashion, you probably should skip this book.<br />  This goes on my own list of books to loan, give or recommend to friends and family members struggling with 'relationship issues.'

And to the friend who loaned it to me, I say, Thanks, Jack!	2000-10-01

This excellent book is an excellent way to learn about Quakers.  Although listed as a Young Adult or Children's title, the book is more than suitable for adults who are interested in the Religious Society of Friends.<br />We are a small, simple group of people, and the Quaker faith involves strong and unconventional spiritual beliefs (silent worship, women speaking in meeting as early as the 1600's, lack of a minister, non-dogmatic use of Scripture), mysticism, acceptance of other believers (it is not unusal to find Unitarians, Wiccas, Catholics and Buddhists in Quaker meetings), lifestyles (simplicity, most often in a non-Luddite manner), and activism (nonviolence, anti-death penalty, prison reform.)  Note: Although Friends were active in the abolitionist movement, this came about only after a minority of Friends convinced the majority that slavery was an abomination.<br />In this tastefully illustrated book,  you will read about the beginnings of the movement in England, with George Fox.  Follow the faith to the Americas, with information about the conflicts that divided the faith into two different groups.<br />An absolute must for each Friend's (or those interested in learning about other Faiths, including Quakers) reading list, along with George Fox's and John Woolman's Journals, Jessamyn West's The Quaker Reader, and Robert L. Smith's A Quaker Book of Wisdom.	2000-09-29

Our history is traced primarily through the words of George Fox and John Woolman.

Recent events in our schools have shown that bullies -- aside from being a  pain in the brain -- can bring out reactions from their victims that are  dangerous.  Teaching our children how to deal with bullies is important for  parents, just as not being bullied is important to kids.<br />I bought this  book three years ago, and read it to my then 6-year-old.  The writing, and  the cartoon-like pictures, made it enjoyable for him.  We discussed the  topic at hand -- bullies.  At that age he was riding the bus to school, and  was on the playground sometimes with older kids -- bullying was a concern  he'd brought up often.  I was concerned -- certainly I didn't want him to  just turn the other cheek. I'd also noticed that sometimes his reaction to  bullies was to 'out bully' them.<br />This book gave him some ideas on how to  cope.  It is a great conversation starter for parents and kids.  Why do  bullies bully?  What else could they do?  What can YOU do if bullied? What  ELSE could you do?  Does bullying the bully work?  Why not?<br />A couple of  weeks ago, before school began, I noticed that he'd pulled the book out and  was reading up on it again.<br />A good book to read with your kids, and  evidently one they can also read to themselves as a refresher course!	2000-09-13

Many of the review copies I've received have been books that were  not what I'd normally chose to read (and in those cases, the books rarely  get finished or reviewed.)<br />This book was a welcome exception.  Often I've  wished I could pass onto my children some of the insights I've had after  years of living and experiencing life.  Or be able to comfort a friend in  troubled times with sage thoughts.  This book offers me that opportunity,  in a  modest-sized, but nicely packaged offering.<br />Maggie Steincrohn Davis  has woven her own reflections with those of well known and not so well  known wisemen and women, and presents us with food for thought appropriate  for many times -- joyfilled or troubled -- in our lives.<br />She says in  the beginning, &quot;I confess, I could have condensed this book into one  sentence - 'See deeply the beauty and interconnectedness of all life; then  think, speak and act from what you see.'&quot;<br />I'm glad she didn't  confine herself to a few words - this book makes a lovely bedside book to  read in those moments when you feel blue.  It makes a wonderful gift for a  friend in a time of need.  It is uplifting, yet simple; inspirational yet  earthy.  It gets added to my list of books to give as gifts.	2000-09-13

The book asks questions as a child might - what is death, what  happens to the body when we die, why does everyone want to know about  death, what happens to the inside of a person (their funny stories,  feelings, thoughts, ideas, love) when they dies?<br />The answsers are  sensible.  Boritzer talks about what different cultures do with the body,  different beliefs of the soul and afterlife (including people who belief  nothing happens), what death might be as seen by different people, and how  making life meaningful now can help a person's memory live on.<br />Not a book  about grieving, with no definite answers, this is a good book to keep on  the bookshelf for the time when the questions will be raised by your child.	2000-09-13

As much as parents think they can totally direct their child's faith, the  truth seems to be that each of us comes to our own understanding of who or  what &quot;God&quot; is.<br />This book is a good opening for discussions of  religion with children (who will eventually grow into adults, with their  own experiences, choices, experiences).  We can lay the foundation, express  our beliefs and hopefully let our lives speak.<br />This is a very short,  brightly illustrated book to have on the bookshelf for those times when a  small child asks, What is God? or when you want to bring up the topic.  The book answers the questions with &quot;Maybe,&quot; which allows the  children to share their own reflections.<br />It also talks very very  briefly about different ways people pray, the great teachers, and the  different religions of the world - Christianity, Judaism, Muslim, and  Buddhism plus a reference to other beliefs.<br />I like the page that talks  about commonality among religions. It also touches on the arguments that  happen when people disagree about God.  It focuses a lot on prayer, and in  the end it suggests ways to talk to God in a universalist way.<br />This  book is not for atheists or fundamentalists of any denomination. Nor is it  for anyone set with the belief that their belief is the only Way. It does  not question the existence of God, although it does provide different  interpretations of what God means, or could mean, to a variety of people.  (Best book on this topic, though, is still Old Turtle.)	2000-09-13

If you have young children (under 14) who 'talk back' to you, you may find  this book to be of some help in undoing what can feel like a hopeless  battle.  My own 9-year old began talking back when he got into first grade,  picking up snappy statements from TV and peers.  I tried to excuse it at  first as just the way modern kids talk to modern parents (I have offspring  as old as 32, all boys, who never talked back this way).<br />After deciding  this really was unacceptable behavior, and recognizing that left unattended  it was getting worse, I started taking steps to stop it.  This book has  been one of the aids (not the solution).  It doesn't expect the parent to  make a friend or equal of the child (rationalize, debate, etc.), but it  also doesn't encourage setting up a dictatorship.  As with many things, the  solution to problems is sometimes in the difficult to maintain moderation  arena, which actually requires more work by the parent.<br />I like this book  because it worked - despite being difficult to do at first, once the child  gets the message, repeat performances are rare and easy to stop. The book  itself is short and to the point, with just four simple steps to follow.  They are common sense - I suspect most of us who have this problem will  recognize them - but busy, often-stressed parents will appreciate the  gentle support and reminders this book offers.<br />1) Recognize what is and  isn't backtalk. (if it hurts, embarrasses, annoys you, its backtalk.  If  the child is just relaying his feelings about something, its an opinion) 2)  Choose an appropriate consequence (unlike 'punishment', a consequence is a  result that makes sense to the child) 3)  Enact the consequence 4)  Disengage from the struggle with the backtalker (don't take it personally,  or you're doomed).<br />Sounds so simple you want to click the &quot;this  review wasn't helpful button?&quot;  It IS simple -- so simple we forget,  so simple it seems to good to be true.  The hard parts of these steps are  #3 and #4.  No book can give you the solution, but books can offer help and  reminders.<br />There are details in the book that I still find helpful -- the  backtalk has pretty much stopped -- all I have to do is remind my son now  that &quot;backtalk isn't allowed&quot; and he immediately stops.<br />In  addition, there are short chapters for backtalk from Adult Children (!),  from Children in College, for Single Parents specifically, and Backtalk in  the Media.  There is a bit of information on support groups and other  resources (not a lot), plus ideas on starting your own support group, as  well as a chapter dedicated to responding to people who disagree with the  methods in this book.d parts of these steps are  #3 and #4.

The  book is divided into three sections - one is from the view of a woman  (Claudia) who ends up on trial for the murder (assisted suicide) of her  mother-in-law (Eleanor), who had Alzheimer's.  The second section is from  Eleanor's viewpoint. The final section is told from the viewpoint of the  Sam, son of the dead woman, as Claudia stands trial.<br />Szeman gives us the  story from different perspectives, something not unusual at all.  However,  as in her first novel (The Kommandant's Mistress), the thoughts shared by  each person are from minds left somewhat unattended.  In the same  paragraph, one sentence or thought will lead to something else from  different moments in the past, then back again to the present.  You cannot  read this book without paying attention, or you will become lost.<br />In  addition, each person has a different view of people and events.  Each  strongly believes their own story to be the correct one.  Of course,  nothing in real life (unlike most movies and novels) is clear, cluttered  (unencumbered by sanity, as the old saying goes). No renditions of an  event, by more than one person, is ever definite, in absolute agreement,  untainted by egos or one-sided perceptions.  In this book, events and  memories are misty, conflicting, unsettling.<br />Most disturbing to me was  Eleanor's section, as it shifted from the muddled murmuring of an Alzheimer  sufferer, gradually moving back in time until she is the wonderful woman  she once was, with a close relationship with her daughter-in-law.<br />You  will never know for sure if there was an assisted suicide, and if so, who  was the helper.  Szeman said in a recent interview that readers are split  down the middle.  If you like a straight-forward who-dun-it, smooth and  clear and easy to read, you may not enjoy this book.  It truly has an  unconventional style, and the read is not relaxing.<br />On the day the book  officially went into the bookstores, it was already in its second printing  - obviously it is speaking to many, so if you are a reader of fine  literature, and a supporter of new and emerging authors, you might want to  give this one a read!n the middle.

His opening chapter, Money, Sex and Power in  Christian Perspective lays out the focus of the book - it is difficult to  walk the walk.  He isn't focusing on the external morality of ethical  behavior, but on the social implications. He offers historical views of  attitudes on money, sex and power, and divides the books into sections that  focus on each issue.<br />In a small section titled &quot;When Good Things Go  Bad,&quot; he says, &quot;There is, of course, a proper place in Christian  life and experience for money, sex, and power.  When properly placed and  effectively functioning, they have the ability as nothing else does to  enhance and bless life.&quot;  He goes on to identify what the problem is  in each area -the demon in money is greed; the demon in sex is lust; the  demon in power is pride.  And he tells us that these really are not matters  we can be neutral about in hopes that they will disappear - if we ignore  them, we will be dominated by them.<br />How do we avoid be controlled by our  own desires, instead of controlling them to our own advantage?  In the  Power area, Foster suggests that we face the demons within, instead of  projecting them on others.  In addition, he suggests that we stop trying to  manage and control others, and focus on our own spiritual powers.<br />Foster manages to be 'proper' without being unrealistically 'prim.'  Whether read by fundamentalist Christians, small &quot;c&quot; christians,  or Buddhists, this book gives food for thought.  Agnostics, athiests and  many free spirits will be turned off by references to the Bible and the  focus on Jesus.<br />I used to think you had to agree with everything you  read in a book, to find it of any use.  There are parts of this book I  don't agree with, but I took what was helpful, and left the rest.  Those  who keep an open mind will find that this is not a dogmatic, preaching  book, but one that will make you think.k I  don't agree with, but I took what was helpful, and left the rest.

This book does not tell us other people's stories, nor is it for  those who are dying, or dealing with the immediate death of a loved one. It  is for the rest of us. Be advised - this is not an easy read - my copy of  the book, which took 5 times longer to read than my usual reading choice -  is riddled with scribbled comments, question-marks, exclamation points, and  words circled and underlined. Let me also add, this is not my style. I'm a  lazy reader.<br />This is a well-written course in the evolution and  retrogression of our individual lives, for (deny it though we might), you  and I are going to die. The questions that worry us most are most probably  &quot;when&quot; and &quot;how.&quot; Singh cannot answer the former, but  this book will help with parts of the latter.<br />Much of what Singh tells us  is based on experiences of those who have worked with those who are  terminally ill, in addition to her own observations. Whether we believe in  Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, a Higher Power, Nature, Singh maintains that the  point of dying is to return us to the place from which we came.<br />She  reminds us that we come into the world thinking we are the center of the  Universe. Perhaps we were right, for it may be that at birth we are as  close to the Creator as we will get, until death takes us back. She  describes how we spend our youth and young adult life developing, then  defending our sense of self. We live, often most pleasantly, in constant  denial of our own mortality, a truth that seems too bleak to accept.<br />In  the latter part of life, we may hold tightly to our ego, but our body  begins to betray us. If we are slowly dying of cancer, AIDS, or the  illnesses of old age, we can grow into acceptance of the insulting truth  that our ego is not the true &quot;us.&quot; One dying woman described it  as having an &quot;ego-ectomy.<br />Singh presents us with additional stages  of dying, expanding on Elizabeth Kubler-Ross' denial; anger; bargaining;  depression; acceptance. Kubler-Ross' stages dealt with the affects on the  ego, or mind; medical science gives us physical stages. Singh offers the  theory that we go through necessary spiritual stages before dying, whether  or not we have been looking for spiritual transformation. Dying offers us a  crash course, the equivalent of a spiritual shotgun wedding.<br />When we are  stripped of everything we thought made us unique, a universal specialness  is revealed. Regardless of when it happens - years, months or seconds from  our death - we will come to realize the unimportance of what was once  important. And despite ourselves we will stumble upon our own unity with  that Force we call many things - God, Universe, Light.<br />I feel more  convinced than ever that death is not a negative, dark force I must flail  against, but the other side of living, a door I must go through. That I'll  figure it out at the end doesn't encourage me to stop seeking now - perhaps  my exit/entrance will go better if I stop running from my fear of death,  and truly live my life. This book is an excellent start in learning now how  to make our own living fuller, so we will be closer to home when we die.it  as having an &quot;ego-ectomy.<br />Singh presents us with additional stages  of dying, expanding on Elizabeth Kubler-Ross' denial; anger; bargaining;  depression; acceptance.

I'd read another of Berg's books (Until the Real Thing Comes Along, a disappointment to me) and wanted to see, since Oprah had selected this book, if it was any good.<br />This book is more than a summer light read, but  not as deep as the dark-humor of  that classic divorce novel, The War  Between the Roses.  And, as another reviewer aptly points out, although the  heroine's kick into mid-life crisis is a divorce, that doesn't have to be  the catharsis - it could have been any other mid-life shake-up.<br />The  opening is hilarious, yet not - Samantha is in shock when her husband walks  out, leaving her with a pre-pubescent son.  In the first chapter, she  decides to be the perfect mother and homemaker.  Martha Stewart she's not,  and her son Travis is not interested in her attempts to carve butter in the  shape of a whale for his French toast - he doesn't want French toast, he  wants Cheerios and a normal life.<br />But life as they have known it is  changing, pretty quickly too. Samantha never goes to see a lawyer, trusting  that her ex-hubby to be will do right by her.  Perhaps he would have, but  when she runs amok in Tiffany's, using a credit card to buy extravagant  china she doesn't really want, but thinks will make her life better, he  cuts off her credit.  She decides to take in boarders, to the horror of  Travis.<br />Indeed, she goes through a gradual metamorphosis that reminds  me a lot of some of my own mid-life changes (for different reasons).<br />This is a story about a woman meeting herself again, and it is handled  well, lightly, but not tritely.  She'd given up music to be the best wife  her wealthy young husband could have - but she doesn't take the predictable  path to re-discover herself.  I was delighted to find the jobs she took on,  and the friends she made.  Her flighty mother turns out to be more than  she'd realized.  Her nearly ex-husband, if somewhat of a stereotype, is  only human.<br />Some reviewers have complained that this book isn't deep, or  that it's boring, or they didn't like the ending.  That may be because they  are too young to have gone through any major life changes.  Samantha is 43,  a not uncommon time for major life changes (whether choices we make, or  ones that are thrust upon us).  We'll make choices that are sometimes seen  later as not for the best.<br />There's a twist towards the end that seems  somewhat unbelievable perhaps because it points out how much has happened  in such a short period of time.

Years ago I read Dowling's The Cinderella Complex and found I shared many  of her views on being female in the 70's.  Red Hot Mamas carries us onto  the Middle Years for emancipated women.<br />Much of it was interesting -  this book isn't information about menopause only (thank goodness -  sometimes an evolving woman needs a break), but is about female aging in  America.<br />From the squeeze caused by needs of children and parents (middle  squeeze), to the realizations that we are no longer fertile, svelte and  young, Red Hot Mamas offers positive looks at the major changes in the  Fifty Something woman's life.  She does offer a lot of information on  Hormone Replacement Therapy, giving women food for thought.  She also  addresses the changes in our relationships with our partners, financial  independence and our generation's waning interest in marriage - not  entirely because fewer men are available.  Although the author is a  feminist, it is clear she is NOT a separatist, but she strongly supports  older women who are more often finding it possible to have relationships  with men based on the needs of both.<br />This book is certainly not for  everyone - traditionalist will no doubt find this book, and probably this  review, not helpful to them.  The rest of us will find this a nice read for  women going through menopause and feeling down.  It offers offers positive  stories of what other women have done with their lives.

Like Wood's book, Old Turtle, this story is more for adults than for the children they'll read it to - the illustrations (a different illustrator)  are beautiful, using soft autumn watercolor tones to illustrate grandfather  as he speaks with his grandchild about nature, spirit and the connection  all people have to one another.<br />Essentially this is a book about loss,  dying and eternal life.  It can be a beginning point for a discussion with  older children (ages 8 - 16 or so) who have experienced a loss of any  beloved friend or family member.<br />If I had grandchildren, I'd want to have  the hardcover book available for them to read.  The book is written to  offer room for people of nearly any faith (even agnostics) to begin a  discussion the meaning of life and dying.	2000-08-24

Approved "miracle" Drug For Women	Books	3	18	21	N	N	If you need info on Evista, this is it..	If you are specifically looking for information on Evista, this book offers a lot of information.  Are you looking for books on menopause -  hormone replacement therapy?  Is estrogen perhaps not right for you?  This  book gives information about Evista (raloxifene), one of the newer SERMS  (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators).<br />It can be difficult enough to  understand HRT (see my other reviews on this topic)  - and now we're given  yet another possible treatment to replace the loss of estrogen that leaves  menopausal women open to heart disease, stroke, fatigue among other things.  This book focuses on the effects of Osteoporosis, ways to prevent, treat  and live with it (6 of the 10 chapters focus on it).  Chapter 4 is  dedicated to Evista, giving lists of ingredients, women who should NOT take  Evista, side effects and its interaction with other medications.  There is  a chapter on other HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapies) that can help a  woman decide what is right for her.<br />This book is a good source for  information on why to use Evista rather than estrogen,  estrogen-progesterone if you are worried about Osteoporisis.  For those of  us more worried about heart disease, stroke and breast cancer, it offers  one chapter &quot;The Future of Evista and SERMS Treating Heart Disease and  Breast Cancer.&quot;<br />The book has bits of general information scattered  throughout - another decent source of information on a topic of interest to  woman of a certain age.  If you are reading lots of books, I'd add this  one to the mix.  Don't use it as your only source of information, though.  Please check out other books on Hormone Replacement Therapy and Menopause,  too.	2000-08-24

As intriguing as the first novel, The Sparrow, Children of God kept me reading, but reluctantly.  Why?  Because I knew once I was finished, I'd  have nothing comparable to read.<br />Mary Doria Russell (a Catholic who  converted to Judaism) is an excellent writer who is skilled at creating  characters that seem real. Her books raise questions that open the mind and  encourage conversation.  They are wonderful to read alone, but would be  great to read and discuss with fellow readers.<br />The story switches  between Naples and Rakhat, and spreads between 2060 and 2096 Earth-Relative  years.  Three different locations are followed - Earth, Rukhat and the  ship, Giardano Bruno.  In addition, we follow the lives of Emilio Sandoz,  Sophia Mendes (originally thought dead), and members of a Jana'Ata family,  Hlavana Kiteri and his descendants.  Despite the many viewpoints, and the  time-changes,  this is an enjoyable, thought-provoking read.<br />Was Jesuit  priest Emilio Sandoz' original mission to Rakhat a success or a failure?  Did God let him down?  Is there more to be done before his work is  finished?  Sandoz is no longer  longer judged by the Church's  interrogators as a prostitute turned baby-killer.  Still healing from the  horrors of his experience and doubtful of his relationship with God, he is  ready to move on, to make major changes in his life - including giving up  his priesthood and marrying.<br />While Emilio is back on Earth, major  changes are being made on Rukhat because of the Jesuit sponsored mission  that started in the first book.  The Runa have slowly begun questioning  their sociological position.  For centuries they were passive, accustomed  to providing the Jana'Ata with everything from childcare to protein.  The  Jana'Ata have never questioned the morality of their treatment of the Runa.  The arrival of the humans, the lives and relationships that are born, the  introduction of new world views causes life as the Runa and Jana'Ata knew  it to be questioned and changed forever.<br />You could read this book  without having read The Sparrow, but I wouldn't recommend it.  Start with  The Sparrow - if you love it, come back for more.  You won't be  disappointed.ta knew  it to be questioned and changed forever.     <br />You could read this book  without having read The Sparrow, but I wouldn't recommend it.

If you, or a friend, are turning 40 - or 50 - this is the book to get for yourself, and/or to give as a gift.  Along with the black crepe, the Over  the Hill balloons and cards, this book is a baby boomer must have.<br />Most  of the books I review are open for lending to family or friends - this book  is an exception.  It sits on my bedside table when it isn't accompanying  me on trips that allow me to do a lot of reading.  This chunky book offers  me comfort and information as I move along in life.<br />In a Chapter called,  &quot;Making Changes That Last!&quot; you'll find these words from the  authors:<br />&quot;One of the downers in midlife is recognizing that we are  no longer protected by the invincibility of youth.  One of its joys is  recognizing that we now have the wisdom and experience we need to take  control of our health and make choices that matter.<br />&quot;The chapters  that follow are filled with lots of sensible and practical suggestions  based on the latest research.  We would like to tell you that there is a  new miracle drug to prevent cancer or reverse aging.  That just isn't the  case...Alas the road to good health in midlife remains largely dependent on  three key ideas: a positive approach, moderation, and consistency.&quot;<br />You can pick this book up, choose any any chapter and find information,  short stories of other Baby Boomers' experiences, short charts, and  explanations.  It begins with a small chapter on the Midlife Journey, and  closes with a short chapter called Body, Mind and Soul.<br />In between,  there are separate chapters on specific female and male issues (prostate  cancer; male menopause; female menopause; breast cancer), as well as shared  concerns.  Memory loss, heart care, intimate relationships, the search for  the Fountain of Youth, Healthy Eating, Exercise and much more are  covered.<br />Best of all, at the end of every chapter is a reference list  with more books to read, organizations, websites to visit and a  cross-reference to other chapters in this book.<br />The thick paperback  edition has an attractive cover, quite suitable as a gift.

This is a small paperback that offers a lot for the perimenopausal - or  menopausal - woman.  This isn't a complete solution book, it doesn't  provide many recipes, or claim to cure symptoms and changes brought on by  menopause.  Instead, it gives basic, simple information on  menopause (from  &quot;what is menopause?&quot; to &quot;What should I know about  osteoporosis?&quot;)<br />In addition to these short, beginner's questions  and answers, Chapters 3 - 7 offers nutritional and dietician's information.  In Everything You Ever Wanted to Ask a Dietitian, there are tips on how  to relieve headaches, nausea, weight gain, as well as advice on how to  lower a woman's risk of heart disease (which rises due to loss of  estrogen.)<br />Much of what she says, many of us already know, but tend to  forget, since the ages between 40 and 50 are often spent in different  stages of in meno-denial (&quot;It might happen to others, but it'll be  different for me,&quot; was my logic.) This book has helpful reminders to  get us back on track,  good to pull out in the moments when we realize not  only CAN it be happening to us, but it IS happening!<br />Chapter 5 gives 20  basic recipes (The 20 Recipes You Can't Live Without), for soy and tofu  based goodies (Quick Tofu Chill, Chocolate Soy Pudding, Iced Mocha, as well  as a basic Minestrone Soup, several Bean Recipes, Power Vegetables and some  Fruit Smoothies.  Chapter 6 offers help in the grocery store, while Chapter  7 gives common restaurant advice.<br />This book is a little high priced, but  offers a lot  of easy to read, basic information to start.  It won't  overwhelm the 'beginner'.  I'd strongly suggest this book for women in  their late 30's to late 40's who know they should know something about  menopause, but aren't really ready for deep, mind-boggling research.<br />While you're at it, check out her other series books AND her larger  books on diet and menopause.

Flipping through it revealed a great book for women  just starting to look into menopause and Hormone Replacement Therapy.<br />This would be my Number One pick for any woman who wants to begin  learning about menopause, in a reader-friendly manner.  It's nice enough to  give as a gift, too.<br />These days we are offered many choices, from no  treatment to new, not quite approved treatment.  In between is a mix of  offers, from birth control pills to soy supplements.  What's a woman to do?  I suggest reading as much as possible.  However, for me, my pre-menopause  years have been spent in denial and confusion.  So much is written that it  is often difficult to digest.<br />I liked this book because it gives clear,  simple explanations beginning with an explanation of what happens to the  body during menopause, complete with drawings and photographs that are  pleasant to look at and easy to understand.<br />Hormone Replacement Therapy  is explained in separate chapters offering what happens if you take HRT,  why some women should, why some women shouldn't, alternatives diet and  exercise.<br />Personally, I didn't want a book that required a lot of  studying - this book is packed with information, as easy to read as Cliff  Notes.  I'd recommend you buy this book for yourself, and keep some on  hand for your female friends and relatives.	2000-08-24

I received the hardcover copy when my first child was born, and it was a fascination to  him at bedtime (age 1 - 3) and his siblings for years and years.<br />The  children's favorite part of this book has always been the search for the  teeny mouse, who is doing something on every page - sometimes he's hard to  find, and although the search went on repeatedly, there was always a squeal  of delight when he was found.<br />This book is a common gift item - the board  book for the child, especially - but a copy of the hardcover can become a  family library gift.  I only wish I could find mine - we went through 1  hardcover and 2 board books!<br />This is one book where multiple copies are  probably always going to be welcome.<br />Consider adding a bookplate with the  new child's name on it.	2000-08-18

As usual, Phil McGraw is steps ahead of the rest of us in sorting out what is *really* going on in relationships. <br />Refreshingly, he begins the book  by questioning the therapeutic standards too often given to the thousands  of couples in trouble.  &quot;The divorce rate in America refuses to drop  below fifty percent, and twenty percent of us will divorce not once but  twice in our lifetime. Clearly, pleasant and generic instructions on how to  communicate better or theoretical musings that give you great insights  about relationships just weren't going to cut it fifteen years ago and  won't cut it now. &quot;    Obviously (to paraphrase him), couples therapy  as we have known it isn't working. <br />You can watch him often on Oprah, but  this book is the next best thing to either watching him there, or having  him as your personal therapist. <br />This book is primarily for relationships  'on the rocks' - the first steps are set up to evaluate and understand what  your relationship is, how it got this way (no surprise, it didn't fall  apart on its own, or because of your partner).  The Seven Steps are not  simple or simplistic, but provide structure for thought and more.  This  book is not about what's wrong with your partner and how to fix him or her.   It is about the person reading the book -- you!<br />This would be a great  book for new couples to read together  (and for this price, why not order  one for you and one for your loved one, and read them first in private,  then together), not just before they are in crisis, but before they decide  to marry.  When the relationship is still strong, new, fresh, it is more  likely that both people will be willing to talk openly about what they  expect and want, and to be able to use the truly helpful instructions on  how to stay together. <br />For those in a troubled relationship, you might  want to read this yourself first, and work on your own issues.  Dr. Phil  has a directness that can be intimidating to some - but for some of us, we  need that extra push.   This book is on my must have list for newlyweds as  well as those in trouble.<br />Highly recommended for those who truly want  that relationship to work!	2000-08-18

We became addicted to the SIMS game as soon as we got it, and eventually  knew we needed to learn to understand our little people a lot  better.<br />This book helped, but it isn't fantastic.  Much of what you'll  find in here you can find at the SIMS home page, and some you'll figure out  by yourself, through trial-and-error. Some is common sense (before making  any major change, SAVE your work so you can always go back).<br />It offers  some things, but omits others.  For example, it gives  a handy chart for  skill levels needed to get promotions - what is missing is how to do what  is hardest, develop and maintain friends, since having a lot of friends is  both required for a lot of the SIMS to 'get ahead' AND is extremely  difficult to do!<br />Some of the cheats are OK, but the best ones you'll  find through other sources.<br />For SIMS beginners (perhaps as a gift for  someone who just got the game), or those who can't get on-line, this would  be helpful. For those who have been playing for awhile, or are on-line,  this book would probably be a disappointment.	2000-08-18

I just mailed a copy of this book to a friend who is dealing with  headaches caused by pressure on the brain - she isn't dying, but the pain  is constant, surgery a long way away, and medication doesn't  help.<br />Levine's book offers a refreshing way of dealing with pain caused  by a variety of diseases - from cancer to the unknown. Often we turn  against ourselves.  We judge how well we do with 'fighting' pain or  'beating' death or even 'praying for someone to heal' by the outcome. If we  fought hard enough, or bargained well enough, our prayers were answered.  If we 'gave up,' that was failure.  Levine's approach is different,  freeing. Rather than fighting the pain, we recognize it as part of us and  go with it, often learning surprising things.<br />Levine offers guided  meditations, something I'm not particularly fond of, but for those who like  to do these, these look like they would be good for people to do with an  ailing family member.<br />He offers stories of the ways people have  successfully dealt with their pain (physical and emotional).  One that  stands out is of a woman who had lead a fairly self-centered, bitter life  (before the pain!).  In the hospital, she was so hard to get along with  that nurses were slow to answer her ring. She was sharp and mean-spirited  to her own family, and eventually they stopped visiting her.<br />Her pain  became so great that, quite uncharacteristically, she began envisioning  other people who might have experienced the pain.  The idea that her pain  wasn't just hers - that it wasn't wasn't a punishment exclusively for her,  but something that many others have had somehow opened her heart, and she  did not die alone.  This isn't written in a sappy manner - there are happy  and sad endings in the book.<br />Levine himself suddenly came to a  realization that praying for someone to get well wasn't working - what did  work was praying that people be able to handle what was given to them.  That takes a load of guilt and betrayal off of those whose prayers aren't  answered, perhaps because they are trying to direct, not be open to, what  is happening between body, mind and spirit.<br />Some of the people he writes  about have healed into dying a more peaceful death. Some have healed back  into life.  This book has to be read to be appreciated, for it is really  hard to explain  how helpful this book is.  If you or a loved one is in  pain, and you are trying to find out how to alleviate it, and you are open  to alternative ways (in addition to, in conjuction with traditional  methods),  please read this book.and betrayal off of those whose prayers aren't  answered, perhaps because they are trying to direct, not be open to, what  is happening between body, mind and spirit.<br />Some of the people he writes  about have healed into dying a more peaceful death.

Steinbeck makes the life of  migrant farm workers come alive for us, while revealing the prejudices they  were up against in the 30's.<br />Sadly, it is timely because it seems to be  part of human nature to separate ourselves from those who are in need.  If  we can convince ourselves that our own wants, needs, desires are different,  or that we are more deserving, we can rest assured that nothing bad will  come our way.<br />A thick juicy book, with every word necessary and  perfectly placed.	2000-08-14

The writing is excellent, which gives  it 5 stars.  But this reader wanted to hear how great Frank McCourt's life  was when he broke free of his childhood and came to America - a happy  ending was strongly desired. That's unfair, and unrealistic, since the  story stops 15 years ago -- and this isn't fiction!<br />After reading and  loving Angela's Ashes, with the McCourt family's struggles against all that  was against them (poverty, alcoholism, dysfunctional family, dying  children) in Ireland and America, I badly wanted to read stories of how  Frank McCourt completely and quickly had a happy life, inspiring students  to improve their lives by sharing his own struggles.<br />McCourt's  life has been a stunning success, but that's not expressed in this book.  It starts when he comes to America in the late 40's, follows his young life  fairly closely  until the 70's, when the stories thin out.  There's a  sudden jump to the 80's and the death of his parents.<br />Don't expect to be  uplifted - this is part of McCourt's life story, and he pulls the reader  into the book just as he did in Angela's Ashes.  You'll struggle, as he  did, with his own shortcomings - bad eyes, bad teeth, a thick brogue,  stubborn, poor yet generous, with a weakness for the drink.  He writes so  well, you'll feel as much of a failure as he did back in those days.<br />Toward the end of this book, he sits in the Lion's Head Bar, looking at  photographs on the wall, of famous writers who'd been there. &quot;I suffer  with envy.  Will I ever be up there?  The writers travel the land, signing  books, appearing on televison talk shows.  There are parties and women and  romance everywhere.  people listen.  No one listens to teachers.  They are  pitied for their sad salaries.&quot;<br /> Of course, we suspect that  eventually his picture will appear on the wall of the Lion's Head Bar --  but the story ends in 1985, and tells us nothing of his passion for writing  or the birth of Angela's Ashes.<br />I find myself hoping he's writing  another book - perhaps another memoir, but preferably a fat, lively novel  where he'll feel free to share his passion and joy for what he has done  with his life.  After reading these books, it is clear the man can tell a  story that keeps you turning the pages, but I've been depressed enough!

This book, a gift from a friend, was a simple read - I am surprised by  some of the reviews that confuse the thoughts in here with Marxism, since I  didn't find much of that. In fact, Elgin's book is filled with quotes from  world religions, citing the reasons we truly need to live a simpler life.  I sat reading this book, surrounded with my stacks of books and clothing -  &quot;things&quot; I do not need but want - and can afford to get. Halfway  through reading, I felt supported in my firm desire (and so far feeble  efforts) to continue unloading my home of excesses while downsizing my  &quot;wants.&quot;<br />Elgin offers this support in a gentle and convincing  way - he offers no directions, for he says &quot;Because simplicity has as  much to do with each person's purpose in living as it does with his or her  standard of living, it follows that there is no single, &quot;right and  true&quot; way to live more ecologically and compassionately.&quot;<br />His  goal is to move his readers to live more simply because it makes more  sense, not because we are told we 'should' do so, or because it is a trend.  He hopes to move us from within.<br />He offers compassionate, thoughtful  reasons to live with less &quot;things.&quot; He also gives a history of  simplicity's roots - using thoughts from a diversity of views: Christian,  Eastern, early Greek, Puritan, Transcendental, and (one of my favorites, of  course!) Quakers.  He recalls an experience he had with Elise Boulding, a  well known Quaker, which helped move him more toward voluntary simplicity  (worth reading the book just to experience this with him.)<br />It makes more  sense, according to Elgin, for the good of the planet, of other human  beings, of our children's future, of our own quality of life, now.  And the  reasons are many - not  economical OR spiritual OR environmental OR  community - but any and all of those (a reader can focus on one that moves  the individual)<br />He offers information on ways of thinking and acting  that lead to a simpler life, and though I fall way short in my own actions  and behaviors, I never felt judged. I did feel moved.  In his final section  on revitalization, he offers ideas for how we might make simplicity happen.  Most of what he says I liked, though I'm not fond of his idea that  &quot;voluntary&quot; changes in consumption would be made if a higher tax  was applied to &quot;luxury goods, gasoline, alcohol and cigarettes.&quot;  While that might make changes, they would certainly not be  &quot;voluntary.&quot; However, that is one small suggestion, not a fixed  line.<br />I especially liked his People Living the Simple Life chapter, with  bits from people who found easy ways to simplify their lives.<br />This book  goes on my gift list for friends who need encouragement, not specific  'how-to directions', in living the simpler life.ays of thinking and acting  that lead to a simpler life, and though I fall way short in my own actions  and behaviors, I never felt judged.

Refreshingly, he begins the book by  questioning the therapeutic standards too often given to the thousands of  couples in trouble.  &quot;The divorce rate in America refuses to drop  below fifty percent, and twenty percent of us will divorce not once but  twice in our lifetime. Clearly, pleasant and generic instructions on how to  communicate better or theoretical musings that give you great insights  about relationships just weren't going to cut it fifteen years ago and  won't cut it now. &quot;  Obviously (to paraphrase him), couples therapy  as we have known it isn't working.<br />You can watch him often on Oprah, but  this book is the next best thing to either watching him there, or having  him as your personal therapist.<br />This book is primarily for relationships  'on the rocks' - the first steps are set up to evaluate and understand what  your relationship is, how it got this way (no surprise, it didn't fall  apart on its own, or because of your partner).  The Seven Steps are not  simple or simplistic, but provide structure for thought and more.  This  book is not about what's wrong with your partner and how to fix him or her.  It is about the person reading the book -- you!<br />This would be a great  book for new couples to read together  (and for this price, why not order  one for you and one for your loved one, and read them first in private,  then together), not just before they are in crisis, but before they decide  to marry.  When the relationship is still strong, new, fresh, it is more  likely that both people will be willing to talk openly about what they  expect and want, and to be able to use the truly helpful instructions on  how to stay together.<br />For those in a troubled relationship, you might  want to read this yourself first, and work on your own issues.  Dr. Phil  has a directness that can be intimidating to some - but for some of us, we  need that extra push.  This book is on my must have list for newlyweds as  well as those in trouble.<br />Highly recommended for those who truly want  that special  relationship to work!but for some of us, we  need that extra push.

Judith Viorst, well known adult author and the mother of sons, uses real life frustrations for this humorous (because its so true) story line, featuring Alexander, the youngest brother in a a family with three boys.<br />The first book is the best - Alexander has the worst days ever in  &quot;Alexander and the Horrible No Good Very Bad Day&quot; (the best of  the stories). In &quot;Alexander Who Used to Be Rich,&quot; he fantasizes  about all you do with a dollar, while in the third book, he resists (as  most kids do) the family's need to move far away.<br />My own sons have  enjoyed these books - starting in 1972 and into the present.  The stories  are not dated, as any parent of a child like Alexander can tell you - every  untied shoelace is a major tragedy, a move around the corner can be  traumatic and 'unfair,' and a dollar can buy you just about anything when  you're in that wonderful 4 to 8 year old time of life.<br />Parents reading  the book will see the humor.  Children hearing the words will feel as  though they are being understood.<br />As kids grow up (8 to 9 is about the  end of the line for this series) they'll begin to see the humor in  Alexander's thoughts.<br />Well written, with illustrations that are well  above average, these books are a wonderful addition to any family library.  And as long as you are going to get one, you may as well get all three and  save yourself time and money!	2000-08-03

Yes, its true -- I dreaded the nights (night after night after night) when one of my sons would insist we read this book!  Why? Because it's long, and  detailed -- good for the child, terrible for a weary parent.  My boys  memorized the story, and if I ever tried to skip a page, I was found out  and the missing page was revisited.<br />This book is a great gift to give to  any child who is enthralled with heavy machinery, but there's more to it  than that.  At the time the story is written (1939) Mike Mulligan and Mary  Anne, his steam shovel, are becoming outdated.  They used to be busy in the  big city, making basements for big buildings. But as always happens,  something better - faster, more efficient gas, electric and Diesel shovels  - is replacing them.<br />Mike Mulligan knows they still have value. He's  always told people that Mary Anne could dig as much in a day as a hundred  men could dig in a week, though he's never been quite sure this is true.<br />To find work, he ventures into the country to the town of Popperville,  where a new Town Hall is being built.  Mike promises to build the cellar in  just one day (&quot;What!&quot; said Henry B. Swap. &quot;Dig a cellar in  just one day!  It would take a hundred men at least a week to dig the  cellar for our new town hall.&quot; ) Henry and the townpeople are swayed  when Mike promises that &quot;If we can't do it, you won't have to  pay.&quot;<br />The citizens of Bangerville and Bopperville, Kipperville and  Kopperville plus all the people from Popperville come out to watch Mike and  Mary Anne work hard under the hot sun. They finish the job as the sun sets,  just in the nick of time.<br />One small boy has been watching them, and he  asks a really good question - &quot;How are they going to get out?&quot;  Mike was in such a hurry, he forgot to make a way to get Mary Anne out of  the cellar.<br />Everyone tries to think of a solution, but it's that astute  little boy who comes up with the best one.  They decide to keep the Steam  Shovel in the cellar, and build the town hall over them.  Mike Mulligan can  be the janitor, the steam shovel will keep the building warm in the winter,  they won't have to buy a new furnace (Henry B. Swap really likes this  frugal thought!) and everyone is happy.<br />The kids who read it especially  like looking at all the tiny details in the pictures, but I think they  especially like the small boy finding the solution that none of the adults  can figure out.<br />In retrospect, I suppose it really wasn't that awful to  have to read it again and again and again.  I've got the original hardcover  in hand, waiting for the grandkids!<br />Definitely worth buying the  hardcover edition!decide to keep the Steam  Shovel in the cellar, and build the town hall over them.

We've finally grown out of this book at our house - but it took a long time.  My soon-to-be 9 year old will occasionally (in secret)read this book  now, but from age 3 to 6, it was a bed time favorite!<br />The story is funny,  as are the illustrations of the little mouse, making a mess and asking for  more things - and it all started by just giving the little fellow a  cookie.<br />The hardcover book alone is a great gift item, but it's better  yet as a mini book with the cute little stuffed mouse.  If you add a small  package of chocolate chip cookies, this would make an exceptional gift.  Or, if not cookies, a crayon set with some paper is ideal (you have to read  the story to understand why!)<br />For kids who want to read and listen, the  audio tape will be listened to again and again.  This is also one of those  books that adults enjoy reading to their children!	2000-08-02

Having been blessed with all sons (ages 8 to 32), I've been able to see some of the external conflicts and internal workings as my babies grew into  young men.  This book supports what I've always suspected - boys are just  as needy of nurturing (from both parents) as girls - perhaps more so, since  to be emotionally needy and male in America is too often interpreted as a  weakness.<br />During the 70's, I sometimes found it difficult to listen to  the angry cries of my feminist sisters (and yes, I think women's minds are  of equal value to men's) who too often seem to be accusing men of just  being born 'bad,' rather than being formed and influenced by the actions  and reactions of people, culture, environment.<br />We women expect our men  (sons, husbands, friends and lovers) to be strong, yet sensitive.  Their  peers often expect them to be 'a man' - strong, not 'a wuss.'  Trapped in a  double-bind, most men respond to the heavy peer pressure, and turn off most  of their emotions.<br />When a  son hits adolescence, with the body and  voice of a grown man, we often think that means he is a man, and should act  like one.  Without defining clearly what that is (for there are often  contradictions), just when they need us most, we set them free in a world  that is confusing, demanding, and frightening. (And if you find your self  thinking there's nothing wrong with that, since that's what being a man  means, I beg you to read this book!)<br />Little boys are expected to move  away from their mother by five or six (to not do so means they'll have  'problems' later in life). When a young boy smacks a friend, we might just  throw up our hands and say &quot;boys will be boys.&quot;  Worse, when an  elementary school boy kisses a girl he likes, he may be accused of sexual  harrassment.<br />What is a parent to do?  Pollack encourages parents to  recognize and support the value in the different styles of parenting found  in fathers and mothers - complementary, instead of competitive, styles  gives more to the children.<br />Instead of pushing young boys out early to  'be a man,' Pollack supports parents who allow their children to stay  connected - to them, and to their own emotions. He encourages parents to  find out what is going on behind those 'it doesn't hurt' looks on faces.<br />Although written before the Columbine horror, one of the most important  parts of this book is the last third, dealing with issues of violence and  young men.  Suicide, homicide, bullying are rampant (stats are in the  book.)  Anger is one of the few emotions boys are allowed to express openly  - fear and hurt are no-no's for a boy who wants to be a &quot;real  man.&quot;<br />This book has been extremely helpful to me, supporting things  I've seen my former mother-in-law do - nurture her sons.  Too often the  idea of a mother nurturing her sons is thought to be emasculating -  evidently, the opposite is true.  Many fathers, too, will find  encouragement in this book - and I suspect since they know more than I ever  will about growing up male in America, much of this will ring true to  them.<br />The book isn't perfectly honed - there are portions that have logic  that isn't fully explained - but this is a thick, enjoyable read that only  hits the tip of the iceberg (he doesn't spend a lot of time on growing up  male in different cultures within America - that would be another book in  and of itself).<br />A must read for teachers, social workers, youth leaders,  therapists, this book is also a good source of information and consulation  for young men and those who love them.d of competitive, styles  gives more to the children.<br />Instead of pushing young boys out early to  'be a man,' Pollack supports parents who allow their children to stay  connected - to them, and to their own emotions.

Are you looking for a good book to introduce a small child to the joys of reading?  Then this one is a great one!<br />Long before I realized that babies are little sponges, someone gave me this book for my then first-born  one year old (1968! ) Since then, this book has been a staple for all my  children, the youngest now 8.<br />I have read to each child, before they  were one - only one isn't as fond of reading as the others, but even he  enjoys a good book now and again.<br />This book is the perfect book to  introduce little ones to the joys of reading.  The words are few and small,  and the question is one of interest to little ones who are still trying to  sort out what is going on in this new-to-them world.<br />The little bird  falls from her nest while mother bird is out getting worms.  She (or he)  goes to every animal she sees and asks, &quot;Are you my mommy?&quot;<br />This simple story keeps the child's interest, because the little ones  are concerned about what happens if they separate from a parent or  caregiver.<br />In the end, of course (I doubt that this is giving away the  story!) the bird finds the mother and all is right.<br />If you want your  children or grandchildren to enjoy reading, this book is an excellent  start.

A young Catholic, she was jailed  because of her efforts as a resistance worker.<br />She watches a co-worker  being beaten to death for trying to wash out her underwear. One of her jobs  is to sort through huge piles of dirty, bloody prison uniforms from those  who are murdered, to find scraps and buttons that can be reused.  Her  single cell is flooded with smoke from the ovens.  She spends much time in  solitude, reflecting on how she will handle her own early death which she  is sure is imminent.<br />She is never marked for extinction, and so has a  slightly different view of life in the camps than the tellers of most books  I've read. Life in one of the worst prisons in France during WWII is not  pleasant, although through she can receive mail, smuggled in Christmas  presents, and medical care when sick.<br />In her isolation, she survives by  befriending the cockroaches in her cell. She secretly makes a Christmas  handkerchief for the Jehovah's Witness who brings meals around.  She  observes the lives of those destined to die, and is deeply moved.<br />Realizing that the only way to bear witness is to survive, she does. It  took 55 years for her to be able to write her story - she spent those years  raising her children and working to improve the lives of the homeless.<br />  Translated from the original French, the tenses used are a little  unsettling, without any obvious reason. The text switches from past to  present sometimes within the same paragraph. It could have used more  editing after the translation.<br />However, for those interested in the  Holocaust, this is a very quick read, and offers a look from the eyes of a  young non-Jewish girl.  A worthwhile read.	2000-07-28

Reading this book was a enriching, rewarding experience for me.  As with most books, it isn't for everyone. I was looking for a little lighter read, since I've been reviewing books on death and dying and the Holocaust.  Silly me - but I am so glad I made the mistake of thinking this would be an  escape from the ultra serious!<br />This is definitely not a light read and in  fact, it hits on many of the issues I've been exploring - the existence and  function of God, the meaning of life, the use of suffering and healing, the  delicacy and necessity of human relationships.<br />The story switches  between the year 2019 - the US has lost its primary position as a world  leader to Japan, marketers search the streets looking for ghetto kids with  intellectual skills to groom and sell as indentured servants - and the year  2060, when a Jesuit priest is under examination for sins he is assumed to  have committed while on a mission to a New World - Rakhat a planet far away  from here.<br />We see Father Emilio Sandoz before the journey (2019) as he  initiates this venture, traveling with characters so well written, I  started to believe they were real.  Dr. Anne and her husband, George; the  recently freed indentured planner, Sofia; the young man who discovered the  existence of the other world, Jimmy Quinn; D.W., their grumpy Jesuit  leader.  Two other characters are less developed, but make nice backdrop  for this riveting story.<br />The book was a little difficult to get into at  the start, not because of the writing, but because of the promise of  horrors to come.  How could this priest, so filled with life in 2019, be so  horribly disfigured (did I really want to read the gruesome details?)  And  how could he have ended up a prostitute, and then murdered a child?<br />Note:  These are not spoilers -- this is information freely given at the  start of the story, a hook that pulls the reader in.<br />To find out, the  reader follows Sandoz' slow recovery, sees his bitterness and anger in his  interaction with the community who is interrogating him in the year 2060,  after he has been rescued and returned from Rakhat.  Sandoz questions the  intimate, passionate connection he'd had with God - and the reader is led  to question some assumptions about God, quite similar to those raised by  the Holocaust. (Isn't God supposed to deliver us from evil if we do all the  right stuff?)<br />A science fiction tale, a mystery, a spiritual quest, a  sociological and anthropology exploration, this book would be an excellent  choice for a group to read and discuss.  It is also great for the  inquisitive mind of the solo reader.<br />As for me, I hated to put it down.  I read it as often as I could, and almost wept when it was done (sort of  Harry Potter for this grown-up!)

This book was a great investment for me - my family has never made it to total vegetarianism, but we are eating less red meat and enjoying the options more.<br />My biggest concern was that in going away from meat, my  family would have no protein - what DO you need to look out for, where do  you find enough protein for growing kids?  Reading this book gave friendly,  easy to understand information along with shopping help and recipes that  can lead the reluctant a little closer to healthy eating.<br />I keep this  book in my cookbook library, and periodically pull it out and for awhile,  cook meals that are tasteful and a little better for our bodies than the  usual typical American meals.<br />More than half of this book is filled with  information on how to step towards vegetarianism in a non-judgmental way.  She gives information, recipes and shopping hints for each stage without  pushing the reader on to the next.  She also realizes that there may be  serveral stages all within the same family.<br />1) Stage One is where many of  us are - less red meat, coffee, refined sugar, more vegetables, fruits and  cereals.  Eating poultry and fish, milk products, egs, beans, and other  grain products.  She lists the pluses of this stage, and doesn't urge  anyone to move on to the next stage unless they want to.<br />2)  Stage Two is  the next step - still eating fish, but almost no poultry, more dairy,  grains, legumes, nuts, seeds.<br />3)  Stage Three goes beyond the more  traditional lacto-ovo-vegetarianism into macrobiotics, natural hygiene.<br />She says here, &quot;The Stage Three diets represent a much larger step  away from what we grew up with, but...remember: You don't have to do it all  at once.  Or forever.  As the teacher said, every little bit  helps.&quot;<br />The last part of the book has recipes, divided by the  stages, which makes it really helpful for people like me who are vegetarian  wannabes, living with meat-lovers.<br />Soups, Casseroles, Indian Side  Dishes, Vegetable Side Dishes, Breads, and more  - some have become  staples, even in the months when we are eating less healthy foods.

Why does my kitchen look like Dexter's Laboratory? Because my 8 year old loves to cook up his own 'recipes', mixing and zapping all kinds of concoctions.<br />When I saw this book, I decided to give it a try, and I'm  glad I did!  It helps to keep the experiments in-line.  There are almost 70  easy, cheap, interesting recipes in this book.<br />The author cautions that  adult supervision is needed - definitely true since although the  ingredients are pretty much common to the household, they include some that  are messy to handle and sometimes a stove or glue guns are used.<br />We leave  our book on the kitchen table, and before running an experiment, my son  checks to see if we have the ingredients.  Food coloring, corn starch,  white glue, funnels, rock salt, water are scattered throughout the book  (the only addition I'd make to this book would be a checklist of common  ingredients, to add to my grocery shopping list!)<br />A favorite for the  little kids (under 7) is the shaving soap/food coloring/egg carton/paint  brush in the bathtub combination. Instant watercolors, with just 2  ingredients (water and food coloring) is also popular or instant finger  paints, with liquid starch, powdered paint and freezer paper.<br />For older  kids, jewels and gems can be made of white glue, the ever-present food  coloring, and rock salt and given as gifts. They can make their own  stickers with water and gelatin, or use coffee grinds, flour and a few  other very ordinary things and make Treasure Stones, to hide gems or secret  messages in, and give to friends (or teachers, or family).<br />Clean up and  prep for most of these are easy enough a child could do it! (As I tell my  son). The index in the back separate concoctions by type (Toys; Paints;  Dough's; Edible Concoctions; Putty, Clay, Pastes; Other).<br />This is a  collection of shared recipes, so there will be some you already have. But  there are 70! (So unless you're a homeschooler or a teacher, there have to  be some new ones).<br />All the recipes are in one place, and the directions  are easy enough for a child (6 and up) to read.<br />We aren't even halfway  through, but we love this so much, we ordered Book Two.

While we didn't enjoy this book as much as the first  one, it was still a welcome addition to &quot;I've got nothing to do&quot;  solutions.<br />With yet another 60 plus ideas to educate and entertain,  indoors and out, this book is great for giving kids something to do that  isn't TV or Nintendo.  This book has more ideas for gift kids can make plus  edible recipes than the other.<br />There's an edible frosting dough (kids can  make sculptures to add to the top of a cake!), a delicious wreath for the  holidays, a shake and make whipped cream, and a fruit roll-up recipe that's  a little different.<br />There are several art projects - a lot of alternative  painting ideas, there are a lot of Garden Concoctions - Apple Head People,  Indian Corn Jewelry, Living Words, Bird Cookies, EggHead Garden, Greenhouse  in a Bag - that are wonderful for kids who like the nature).  We especially  like the number of concoctions that can be made as gifts for friends and  relatives - Magic Candle Art, Ice Lanterns, Kooky Clingers, Magic Photo  Art, Peppermint Wreaths, Silly Stained Glass, Cool Crayon Tee Shirts.  Don't let the 4 - 8 age recommendation on this book fool you - older kids  will like this book - just leave it lying around the kitchen and older kids  will probably find something they'd like to make!<br />Adult supervision is  definitely needed.  Many of the ingredients are common to most households,  but some are not. Most projects take pre-planning.

A few steps above most light summer reading, this book is almost on the same rung as &quot;She's Come Undone,&quot; which I enjoyed long before it became an Oprah selection. These days, I don't often finish reading  fiction, unless I plan to write a review; often I drag myself reluctantly  to the end, yawning all the way.<br />But this book was a fast, fun, witty 2  hour joy. I read it as I sipped my caffe latte in a local bookstore, where  I often explore books before making a purchase. I read the whole thing. The  only reason I didn't buy this book was -- the price (full price in that  particular store).<br />It is wonderful, and if it had been in paperback, I  would have snapped it up. If I was buying it for a gift, I would have  invested in it, for it is sure to please the reader who enjoys nostalgia,  good writing, and humor, all rolled into one!<br />The story begins with the  arrival, in the early 50's, of a black and white television set at the  Palmer residence. With the tv comes the beginning of some major changes not  just in that household, but in the lives of most of us.<br />The talented  Marjorie Klein demonstrates that by telling the story from dual viewpoints  - mother and daughter. Lorena's view is written in third-person - she is a  self-centered, talent-free mother and wife, who will do anything to be a  star.<br />Cassie, the 10-year old daughter of Lorena and her frustrated  husband, Pete, speaks to us in first person, sharing her embarassment over  her mother's behavior and her deepening understanding about what is  happening.<br />If you grew up in the 50's, you'll remember the television  shows and stars that are woven through-out the novel. Lorena's  disappointment of her life as a housewife and her twisted vision of herself  as a star is fed by the shows she watches. As she changes hairstyles (never  quite getting the right perm), practices her ticket to fame - a tap dancing  rendition of Chattanooga Choo Choo - and seduces the mailman who's cousin  &quot;is in television,&quot; Cassie watches her mother and her *own*  television shows.<br />No one believes her when she describes what she sees,  for everyone else sees only the familiar test pattern (for those of us who  remember when television went off the air late at night!). Cassie sees  funny dances called odd things like the twist and the monkey. She sees a  movie star who is a president, and watches another president die, the  Simpson family and war, right there on tv. She sees in to the future.<br />To  tell you this doesn't reveal the plot at all, for the real story is the  entertwining of Lorena's fantasy, the unraveling of the Palmer marriage,  and Cassie's vision of what the future can be.<br />One of her friend's  parents starts to believe her, and asks her gently, &quot;is there anything  you can do to change what happens?&quot;<br />For the most part, there is  nothing she can do until one night, she sees something horrible about to  happen in her own life -- can she do anything to change it?<br />You'll have  to read it for yourself and find out. This book is good -- very good. It  very well may be this author will be famous someday. Wish I had a test  pattern so I could see.

Planning and  packing, bartering (excellent tips on this - you can use them here!), money  exchange, culture shock, knowing the language and alternatives, luggage  options (complete with instructions on how to make your own money belt),  food, alternate housing, and more.<br />Although the only trips I'm planning  for the next year are of the more mundane variety - to European cities with  family members - as I read stories about women traveling alone or with  friends in India, Thailand and other exotic places for 3 months and longer,  I found myself thinking maybe I could do this - if only I could  just drop  responsibilities and go. (She offers a chapter with trip planning, several  months out, outlining what responsibilities need to be dropped or covered,  and how to do it!)<br />Since I can't, reading this book gave me the feeling  that I've at least shared the experience, while offering lots of  information about how to &quot;go&quot; if ever I'm able.<br />The resource  section at the very end has a wealth of information.  A good read for you,  a gift for a wanna be traveler, a nice read for wistful couch potatoes like  me.	2000-07-16

The star rating for this book was difficult to decide on - I'd wanted to move it up to 3 1/2 stars, maybe 4 -- but the rating would have to be conditional. This book is not for everyone - the topic and the writing  style are both disturbing, probably not by chance.<br />Sherri Szeman was my  creative writing teacher some years ago - she was an excellent teacher, a  demanding critic, sending things back for re-writes, as I creaked my way  back from years of non-writing.  I picked up a galley edition of her  newest book (currently titled &quot;Only With the Heart&quot;) at a recent  bookseller's convention, and though I'm three-quarters of the way through,  found it so frustrating that I decided to read her first novel, &quot;The  Kommandant's Mistress,&quot; which had gotten rave reviews.<br />Although the  style used in both books is virtually identical - shifting without warning  several times in each chapter from different time periods in the  character's life (very difficult to get used to), I found that unusual  style worked in this book much better than it does in her new book.<br />Why?  It may be because this book reflects an extremely disturbing time, when the  minds of a nation were (to put it mildly) confused, mired in the darkness  of Adolph Hitler's leadership.<br />The first part of this book is written  from the perspective of the Kommandant, the second from that of the  mistress, who of course is not a traditional mistress by choice or  definition. The last section offers two short bios of the characters which  leave many questions open.<br />Someone called this a poorly disguised  Harlequin -I would have to say, NOT!  Harlequins are formula novels, light  and fluffy.  If you prefer your novels to have a plot neatly laid out, with  a satisfying conclusion, do NOT read this book - you will be disappointed!<br />If you enjoy a creative writing style, and an in depth look into the  lives of two ordinary (not normal) people in an exceptionally evil time,  you will probably enjoy this book. The lead  characters are full and  complex, the story is gripping. Szeman has researched the events of the  time and uses quotes from historical figures (she provides a long list of  books in her Author's Notes for anyone who wants to read more about that  time.<br />For those who have an interest in the Holocaust, this book should  be on the 'must read' list.time,  you will probably enjoy this book.

I decided to read it  anyway, even knowing the ending, and find that I'm glad I did.<br />Very  well-written, with a clever, poignant plot, this is a story that will stick  with you. The  narrator is Gordie, a young writer who wants to achieve the  same fast success his mother reminds him (constantly) that his deceased  father managed to find.<br />It's hard to say what needs to be said about this  very good book without giving things away.<br />Gordie starts at the bottom,  as an obit writer, low-end in the newspaper world - under the supervision  of an aging, failed writer and editors who stab at Gordie's eager ego every  time he attempts to take short cuts to success.<br />His lies tangle with the  lies of others, his pride encourages him to inflate himself and blinds him  from the truths. His inexperience couples with his wish to succeed; he  seduces himself into believing what he wants to believe (aided by Alicia, a  young and recent widow who has ego needs of her own).<br />Inevitably, Gordie  finds himself both caught in, and part of the cause of, a tragedy.<br />(Note: what a previous reviewer's comments mean -- about LBJ, cowboy  songs and Vietnam -- is a mystery to me, for none of those things are in  this book)<br />This story is one that is not just good to read, but causes  you to reflect for a long time after finishing.	2000-07-12

I ignored it, but kept feeling drawn to it.  The title seemed a bit extreme, yet I kept wanting to pick it up.  When I started reading, I realized that  one of the people it was about was me.<br />If you have lost a parent as a  child, please read this book.  It is not a self-help book - but it leads to  healing by acknowledging that the loss of a parent is a major event in the  life of a child, changing that child's view of the world and affecting his  or her life into adulthood.  Like attending a 12 step program, and feeling  instantly at home, this book opens doors to a community of like-minded  souls.<br />Our culture used to minimize the effects the death of a parent has  on a child.  While adults grieved in their own healthy or unhealthy ways,  children were often ignored, sent off to relatives, cut off from one-side  of the family and often introduced to a new, substitute parent and expected  to never talk about the parent they lost.<br />My own father died a sudden,  fairly publicized death when I was 17 and my sister was 11.  I've been  painfully aware that there was one life before he died, and another one  after, as clean a break as you could make cutting a thick rope with a sharp  knife.  But no one else - aside from therapists - seemed willing to talk  about it. With children, it is important that the grieving process not be  ignored or minimized, for how they process their grief will have a lasting  effect on how they live their own lives.<br />While reading the stories in  this book, I felt deeply saddened and warmly comforted. The book validated  what I have known to the core of my heart for a long time.  The death of a  parent makes a hole that lasts forever.<br />Now, that hole isn't dark and  deep forever. It isn't a huge pit you fall into and can't get out of,  though at times it might feel like that. Instead, it is a loss, or an  absence, that is always there, sometimes small, sometimes large. It can be  healed, to varying degrees.  But it is there, and it will not go away.  Ignoring it only seems to enlarge it.<br />Harris' book offers the comfort of  knowing that the reactions we had to our parent's death -- and still have,  as we procede through life without that parent -- are not abnormal.  I  realized that many of the things I did that weren't so good for my life  were 'normal' reactions (and thank goodness I've learned from them all).<br />Better yet, some of the things I've done that have seemed a little odd  to others are actually healthy and quite common. For example, in my  personal pages I have a web page for my father -not a grieving memorial,  but a place filled with photos and memories to share with my own children,  who never met him, and with other family members. In the chapter entitled  &quot;Staying in Touch,&quot; Harris tells how some of us talk with our  parent, years after they've died. Other cultures have rituals to remember a  lost parent. It isn't morbid -- it is a way to grieve, heal and move on  without trying to erase memories that need not go away.<br />She tells stories  of over 60 individuals, each with a very different situation.  The chapters  cover the grown children's struggles to grow up without one -- sometimes  two -- parents; to risk loss in love and other relationships; the changed  relationship with the surviving parent; issues in parenting their own  children; dealing with their own mortality.<br />This book is not a  self-help book, but a book that anyone who has lost a parent before they  were 18 should be aware of and read when they are ready. It is also an  excellent book for the surviving parent who wants to be aware of their own  child's needs.<br />For me, this was an excellent and helpful book.all, sometimes large.

A  necessary read for anyone  interested in not just the spiritual side of dying, but the practical,  political, difficult aspects of dying.<br />When I started reading books on  dying (Final Gifts by Maggie Callanan, Patricia Kelley; The Grace in Dying  by Kathleen Singh), I read books that gave me hope and comfort in dealing  with my own mortality.  This book made the hair on my neck rise up.<br />It  begins by shattering illusions (the ones I'd built up)  about having a  pain-free, easy death.  There are insurance companies, personal opinions,  differing agendas of a variety of institutions that come into play.<br />In  short, some people have an easier death than others.  Webb writes in an  easy to read, article style. She begins with a chapter called &quot;Dying  Easy&quot;, about the  nearly beautiful, fairly comfortable death of Judith  Hardin, who at 36 dies at home with her husband and children.<br />&quot;Dying Hard,&quot; is based on Webb's personal interviews and  experiences with the death of Peter Cicione.  Cicione died a death more  painful than it needed to be, largely due to medical staff's fears that  this dying man was misusing morphine,  might overdose or use so much  medication that the drugs would no longer be effective (not true).<br />In  &quot;The Sorcerer's Apprenctice&quot; and &quot;When Death Becomes a  Blessing,&quot; Webb focuses on the history of medical control of pain, the  prolonging of life with new medical techniques and modern pain control  through the works of Dr. Kathleen Foley, director of neurology pain service  at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.  Foley estimated that 5% of the  patients she was seeing were &quot;in unassuageable pain.&quot;  Webb's  conservative estimate offers that &quot;109,500 people a year die with  unrelieved suffering.&quot;  Much of this is due to outdated information,  old rules, and misunderstandings about how much medication a dying person  in severe pain can and should get. She offers the possibility that  terminally ill patients who want to commit suicide or look for assistance  in dying might not do this, if their pain could be properly handled.<br />She  has chapters about the legal conflicts for families who want comatose  relatives off of life-support systems, with detailed information about  Karen Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan's cases and the affects on their families  long after these women died.<br />&quot;Bearing the Burden&quot; focuses on  what happens to the lives of families with a terminally ill member -  &quot;The sad secret that many don't want to admit is that care at home,  wonderful as it can be in helping a patient to a good death, is hard on  families. Home care may allow for those close, intimate, late-night times  with the dying family member...but there are also the difficult times:  changing diapers, losing sleep or feeling intense anxiety because the  patient is in pain or can't breath...&quot;<br />This first half of the book  is tough reading, but necessary - for there is still a lot of work to be  done to make dying easier.  The second half of the book deals with hospice;  assisted dying (suicides); spirituality in dying.<br />She closes with 10  common factors 'good deaths' have - 1) open, ongoing communication with  doctors, patients, families 2) preservation of the patient's  decision-making powers for as long as possible 3) sophisticated pain  control 4) limits on excessive treatment (medical interventions, per the  patient) 5) focus on preserving the patient's quality of life 6) emotional  support 7) financial support 8) family support 9) spiritual support 10)  patient isn't abandoned by the medical staff even when curative treatment  is no longer required.<br />She also has 10 changes, which she believes need  to be made to change the culture of dying from a cold, hospital-set  detachment to a  family affair.These encompass everything from expanding  health insurance to cover needs currently not met, to legalization of  assisted suicide.<br />If you have given little thought to some of the darker  sides of dying, focusing as I have on the spiritual and more uplifting  side, this book offers a lot of food for thought.  Well-written, easy to  read, disturbing.<br />Even if you have different opinions than Webb has  (about assisted suicide, for example), this book is a good read to  investigate the other side's information and arguments.ily affair.

Like Richard Cormier's books, this &quot;Young Adult&quot; novel is not just for those under 20.<br />Nothing is black and white, everything is poetic, mysterious and slightly cloudy in this original, enticing novel by  David Almond.<br />The opening chapters look morbid - Kit is new to the  community where his ailing granddad grew up, a mining town in England. He's  reluctantly drawn into a group led by the dark and sinister John Askew, the  son of the town alcoholic.  These kids play a game called &quot;Death&quot;  - Askew holds a knife to the one chosen in a spin-the-bottle selection, and  takes them into the deep dark mine and leaves them there.  The Dead One  emerges moments or hours later, claiming to have been truly dead.<br />I got  that far and thought this book wasn't for me - surely something evil was  going to happen to Kit who was drawn both to Askew and the game.<br />I pushed  on, and was greatly rewarded. Kit struggles with his wish to believe that  no matter what others may say about someone, there is a goodness within  all, waiting to be recognized and invited out.  He expresses this through a  story within-the-story, that ties in with Askew's disappearance, his own  grandfather's preparation for dying (wonderfully handled) and his shadowy  visions of many children - one special one named Silky - who died years ago  in the mines.<br />Although I saw this somewhere referred to as like Harry  Potter, I'd have to say it's not - the audience for this book is looking  for more substance than entertainment (and I LOVE Harry Potter books).<br />An  excellent read!	2000-07-02

Not only did I have them, I'm sure I was one, too - there's nothing like a corporate environment to bring out interesting tendencies in anyone.  When I received an anonymous e-mail at work, with  excerpts from this book, I had to have it!<br />Easy to read, written with  wit and actual substance, this book (predecessor to the very popular  &quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&quot; and &quot;When Smart People Work for Dumb  Bosses&quot;) helped get me through some difficult times.<br />If you can't  just stop working to do something you really enjoy -- and not many can,  aside from Dilbert's Scott Adams and me -- this book is like an emotional  teddy bear with teeth. He defines  different &quot;Crazy Bosses&quot; by  behavior (most of us are a mix), reasons why they may be that way, and  practical ways to work with them, because most of aren't likely to get away  from them, even if we change corporations and bosses.<br />  The truth most  of us don't want to know is that the insanity of the business world is ours  to deal with, not management's to fix. There is no one coming to the rescue  - and we each play our own part to the madness, by our own responses.  This  book is a good aid with suggestions on what to do and what NOT to do, to  survive.<br />We have to rely on our own emotional and physical health,  friends, a sense of humor and a sense of our own self-worth (aside from  work) so we won't feel like a victim.<br />The book I found the most helpful  throughout my corporate life - and it was great in my real life, too - was  M. Scott Peck's &quot;The Road Less Traveled.&quot;  &quot;Life is  difficult,&quot; and once we figure that out, we can get on with living!  If you are feeling like a victim, read these books and start a discussion  with a friend or two!<br />Good luck - and rest assured that there *is* life  after work!	2000-06-30

Retreating, I was terrified of my own mortality and of what I might do if I were around  someone who was dying.  Would I say the wrong thing or nothing at all?  Would I cry, or do something to inadvertently hurt them? What is dying  like?  This book is great as a comforting instruction manual on what  happens, what to do, and what not to do.<br />It begins with information about  what happens to the body when it is in the process of dying, then moves  into experiences the authors have had in dealing with people who are dying,  or whose loved ones are dying.  They have helpful information throughout  the book for those, like me, who were unsure about what to say or do.<br />They include individual stories about messages people send when they are  approaching death and how not to miss them; seeing people who have already  died and what that may mean; symbolic dreams and how to let the dreamer  find the meaning; choosing a time to die (not by suicide); waiting for a  person to arrive or an event to happen.<br />Family and friends often ignore  this precious information. It seems illogical, far out, too much like  stories about abduction by aliens.  We brush them off as hallucinations,  caused by denial or possibly drug-induced.<br />When I first heard volunteers,  nurses and others who work in hospice tell stories of people who have  similar Nearing Death Experiences (not to be confused with &quot;Near Death  Experiences&quot;), I was dubious.  However, in my readings and hospice  volunteer work, I find that these stories are universal, timeless and not  as new age-y as I'd thought. We've been ignoring these wonderfully soothing  stories of how people die, because for years we've moved birthing and dying  out of the family and into hospitals. We are beginning to move them  back.<br />If you've lost a loved one, are dealing with someone who is dying  (yourself or someone else), if you avoid visiting friends who are dying or  if you're struggling with your own awareness that someday you will die,  please read this book.  It will put your mind at ease.one who is dying  (yourself or someone else), if you avoid visiting friends who are dying or  if you're struggling with your own awareness that someday you will die,  please read this book.

I've not read any of Elizabeth Berg's other books, although I want to - her writing draws you in to the characters, her descriptions and dialogues are excellent. This story was well written, mildly entertaining (I read it  all the way through), but unfulfilling.<br />A few chapters into the book,  though I still wanted to keep on reading, I wondered if this was the book  the latest Madonna movie was based on - girl wants baby, girl has baby by  gay best friend, everyone lives happily ever after.<br />This book isn't that  story - there's a bit more.  Patty's clock may be ticking, but not  necessarily for a baby. She thinks it might be for Ethan, but she seems to  be searching for some meaning in her life, without knowing where to start.  She isn't the only one who is lost, for somehow the message the author was  attempting to relay doesn't quite get to the reader.<br />In the beginning,  Patty tells of her 'house game.'  An unsuccessful real estate agent, she's  been playing this game since she was a child. When driving around, she  looks at houses, then picks one she pretends is hers. The only rule is that  after she picks it, she can't change her mind if something better comes  along.  She claims she never feels regret. Here is the big clue about  Patty, and what she's doing with her life.<br />Patty is so preoccupied with  her own lack of a love life, she misses clues her parents scatter around  that something is not quite right. She throws away, without even trying him  out, the ideal guy for her, fixating on someone she can never have,  settling for less than she needs to - but in the end, she's moderately  contented.<br />It isn't until the end of the book that the hollowness of  Patty Anne Murphy's life comes to light.  She has found meaning through her  baby - but she's the fifth wheel in a warm dinner in her new home. She  claims that's OK - but it sounds a bit like her acceptance of the old game  rules for 'house'-- hard to believe.  If you really peek closely, you can  see hints that she's finding out the real thing she was waiting for wasn't  the unattainable guy, nor necessarily the lovely new addition to her life -  but is perhaps her acceptance of just being herself.<br />There seems to be a  chapter missing towards the end; readers have to struggle harder than Patty  to find some clues.  Somehow the connection between writer and reader  doesn't quite make it (as other reviewers of this book seem to agree).<br />It wasn't until I read the interview with Berg after the end of the  story that I understood some of her deeper intents for the book.

My first copy was free, but I'm going to buy more as gifts because I want this author to write more!<br />When I got my copy of this book at a recent booksellers convention, Robert Rubin asked me as he signed it, &quot;So, is  this a dream of yours, to hike the Appalachian Trail?&quot;  No doubt an  amusing question to ask of a slightly plump, middle-aged woman exhausted  after 4 hours of walking the floors, but in actuality, I had to tell him --  &quot;Yes!&quot;<br />Years ago I had a dream, to take 6 months off from  work and life, and walk the Appalachian Trail, alone.  There has to be more  to life than working 9-to-5, I'd thought -- a sentiment Rubin shared when  he made his decision to abandon job and wife for half a year.  In my case,  time slipped away. I grew older, with more responsibilities and  limitations, and recently realized that for me, this long and lone journey  isn't likely to happen.  This book simultaneously put that dream to rest,  while making it come as true as it can be for me.<br />In the beginning of  the book, Rubin shares a quote you'd find at the start of the journey --  &quot;Appalachian Trail - Georgia to Maine - A Footpath for those who seek  Fellowship with the Wilderness.&quot;  In this shared journal of his 6  month venture, Rubin finds just that, and more.  From the start. he knows  he's going on some sort of pilgrimage -- a search for meaning in his life.  Though he never spells out what he found, by the end of his journey,  it is  clear that he has gotten where he needed  to go.<br />Rubin is a true  storyteller, weaving together day-to-day happenings with past events that  put him on this path, pulling the reader in so close we are there with him  as his body is put through the rigors of 2,160 miles of walking, climbing,  falling (don't let hikers tell you they never fall on the Appalachian  trail!), being sick and eating portable meals that eventually taste like  paste. His humor shows through - I laughed outloud in several places  (that's just not like me - I'm more of a silent smirker).  He develops  friendships with other thruhikers -- those who are hiking the trail from  start to finish -- Kilgore Trout,  RockDancer and many more - while  struggling to assure his wife of ten years that though he's left her behind  (alone at home with the dog), he will be coming back.<br />Hiking this  trail is one of the last adventures in the United States -- it would be  impossible to finish it without changing your self, to some degree.  Each  section has a map of the leg of the journey he's on with miles hiked, and  miles to go.  By the end of the book, as the 'to go' got down to less than  150, I was nearly as excited as he must have been -- almost there!  Never  once did I get the message from him (though others would strongly disagree)  that those who don't make it all the way through are 'less than.'  In fact,  I find myself wondering now if I could be a &quot;section hiker&quot; --  for me, a month would more than meet my pilgrimage needs, while probably  being the emotional and physical equivalent of Rubin's 6 month  journey.<br />If you're a wanna be hiker, if you watch the Travel Channel, or  liked watching &quot;Survivor&quot; for the adventure and camaraderie  (before it started getting really mean), you will love this book!  I'll be  buying a copy for at least one of my three sons, the middle one who isn't  quite sure what to do with the rest of his life. Meanwhile, I'm going to  buy myself a book on short hikes on the Appalachian Trail. Anyone care to  join me?veral places  (that's just not like me - I'm more of a silent smirker).

Unless you believe that when we die, we cease to exist (period, end of life), and whether or not you work with the terminally ill, this book is a must read.   This book does not tell us other people's stories, nor is it  for those who are dying, or dealing with the immediate death of a loved  one.   It is for the rest of us.  Be advised - this is not an easy read -  my copy of the book, which took 5 times longer to read than my usual  reading choice - is riddled with scribbled comments, question-marks,  exclamation points, and words circled and underlined.  Let me also add,  this is not my style.  I'm a lazy reader.<br />This is a well-written course  in the evolution and retrogression of our individual lives, for (deny it  though we might), you and I are going to die. The questions that worry us  most are most probably &quot;when&quot; and &quot;how.&quot;  Singh cannot  answer the former, but this book will help with parts of the latter.<br />Much  of what Singh tells us is based on experiences of those who have worked  with those who are terminally ill, in addition to her own observations.   Whether we believe in Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, a Higher Power, Nature,  Singh maintains that the point of dying is to return us to the place from  which we came. <br />She reminds us that we come into the world thinking we  are the center of the Universe. Perhaps we were right, for it may be that  at birth we are as close to the Creator as we will get, until death takes  us back.   She describes how we spend our youth and young adult life  developing, then defending our sense of self.   We live, often most  pleasantly, in constant denial of our own mortality, a truth that seems too  bleak to accept.<br />In the latter part of life, we may hold tightly to our  ego, but our body begins to betray us. If we are slowly dying of cancer,  AIDS, or the illnesses of old age, we can grow into acceptance of the  insulting truth that our ego is not the true &quot;us.&quot;   One dying  woman described it as having an &quot;ego-ectomy.<br />Singh presents us with  additional stages of dying, expanding on Elizabeth Kubler-Ross' denial;  anger; bargaining; depression; acceptance.  Kubler-Ross' stages dealt with  the affects on the ego, or mind; medical science gives us physical stages.    Singh offers the theory that we go through necessary spiritual stages  before dying, whether or not we have been looking for spiritual  transformation.  Dying offers us a crash course, the equivalent of a  spiritual shotgun wedding. <br /> When we are stripped of everything we  thought made us unique, a universal specialness is revealed.   Regardless  of when it happens - years, months or seconds from our death - we will come  to realize the unimportance of what was once important.  And despite  ourselves we will stumble upon our own unity with that Force we call many  things - God, Universe, Light. <br /> I feel more convinced than ever that  death is not a negative, dark force I must flail against, but the other  side of living, a door I must go through.  That I'll figure it out at the  end doesn't encourage me to stop seeking now - perhaps my exit/entrance  will go better if I stop running from my fear of death, and truly live my  life.  This book is an excellent start in learning now how to make our own  living fuller, so we will be closer to home when we die.	2000-06-20

My youngest child has been afraid of the dark, strange noises, and the unknown for a long long time.  At age 6 he discovered this book, and read it again and again.<br />This surprised me at first - it's a lot like Hansel  and Gretel but for a small child, boy or girl, who is dealing with the  scariness of the real world, Bony-Legs is a story that's scary but  encouraging.  What goes around will come around, is the message this book  gives.<br />Sasha's aunt (her mother never would have done such a thing!)  sends her to Bony-Leg's house in the woods to fetch a needle and  thread.<br />Along the way, Sasha is kind to a hungry cat and a skinny dog,  feeding them her lunch. She greases a creaking gate at the entrance to  Bony-Leg's cottage.<br />&quot;Poor gate,&quot; said Sasha, &quot;You need  some grease.&quot;<br />  Once she gets to Bony-Leg's, she's locked in the  bathroom, told to get nice and clean so Bony-Legs can eat her up.  The cat,  the dog she fed  on her way to Bony-Leg's give her a mirror, a wooden comb  and let her escape without a mew or a bark.  The kindly oiled gate lets her  out without a squeak.<br />With the help of these others, and the use of her  own cleverness in figuring out how to use the mirror and the comb, Sasha  escapes. And Bony-Legs - well, you'll have to read the story to find out  all the details!<br />An enjoyable, short read filled with color pictures and  a kind child's cleverness.	2000-06-19

When I first saw this book listed, I thought &quot;who on earth would buy that?&quot;  Well, turns out that would be me, buying it as the perfect gift for my ex, for Father's Day.  [Let's just say, &quot;average Joe with  a touch of Dudley Do-Right.&quot;]<br />Of course, before wrapping it I had to  read the whole thing through, cover-to-cover, and later wrestle it away  from our almost-9 year old, who said it was scary, funny and interesting. I  think he only gave it up because he knew he could finish it later.<br />True,  many of the worst-case scenarios in this won't happen to me - I can't  picture how I'd get into a situation where I'd have to leap from a  motorcycle to a car, deal with a charging bull, or have to survive if my  parachute doesn't open.  Then again, if it happens, I'll be ready!<br />And it  just might be possible that I'll need know how to treat frostbite, survive  at sea, use a defibrillator to start someone's heart, survive an  earthquake, make a fire without matches or avoid being struck by  lightening. Now I know - and maybe one of the important things I know is  that you CAN survive from some pretty awful things!<br />One of the most  amusing parts of the book is in the intro, where the authors warn us -  insist, actually -- that we consult a professionally trained expert before  trying anything in this book.  Good advise, if you happen to have one with  you when that mountain lion attacks.<br />But as they say in the preface,  &quot;You never know&quot; and &quot;be prepared&quot;.<br />If you want to  save your money for retirement, as one reviewer advises, I'd say that's  fine. Buy it as a gift for the traveling student or co-worker or for that  information-addict on your gift list.<br />Better yet, put this little book  on your own Wish List!	2000-06-18

The Bailey School kids are fine for him to read alone, but I  can't read another one in that series without falling asleep!<br />We are a  family of readers and writers, and one of our favorite things to do is sit  and read to each other - what book would fill that need while we're waiting  for the fourth Harry Potter book? <br />We'd read C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of  Narnia long ago (as far as we could get before it got too complex for us),  so what were we to do?<br />Then I remembered this book, sitting on my  bookshelves from days gone by - the paperback version I have cost  $1.25(! ) and had been first read by me and then by my older sons. I  pulled it off the shelf, blew off the dust, opened it...and it fell apart.   So I ordered up this book and the next two from Amazon. <br />We got them  soon, and haven't stopped reading yet (as of this writing, Harry's Fourth  Book is ordered, but even the title is unknown).  My son actually brings it  to me, begging me to read some more (something that's only happened with  Harry Potter so far.)  <br />As with Harry Potter and Chronicles of Nania, as  we started reading, we got involved in the lives of some very likeable  people and wanted to find out what was going on in their lives. We read two  chapters at a sitting, which can be torture - what is going to happen next?  <br />     Because the book was written long ago, it is delightfully empty of  the extra angsts teenagers have to worry about today.  One of Meg Murry's  biggest worries is that she'll never be as beautiful as her own scientist  mother. She is  harrassed at school because of her 5 year old brother's  brilliance (Charles Wallace is a genius who seems stupid to others). And  her father's absence is the talk of the town (did her run off with  someone?).<br />Charles Wallace makes friends with Mrs. Who, Mrs. Whatsit and  Mrs. Which, three strange old ladies who turn out to be much more than they  seem.  They know where the children's father is, and take Meg, Charles  Wallace and Calvin (Meg's hunky-nerdy classmate) to find him.<br />The forces  of evil are at work, though, and the children have to struggle to resist.   One of them gets pulled in, and only one can save them all. When the book  ends, you aren't left with a cliff-hanger (like the Anamorph series, for  example). Things are settled and you can move on to something else, or do  like we've done, and move onto the next book, A Wind in the Door.<br />Like  Chronicles, but unlike Harry, the author is sending a  message - there are  biblical references so discreet you won't notice them unless you already  know of them.   <br />   This is a book to read with your children. Many of  the words are too difficult for a child to figure out and offers an  opportunity to discuss many things with your child, while  &quot;visiting&quot; with an unusual, yet ordinary, family you'll want to  visit again!	2000-06-17

I'm holding them for the grandchildren. The Frog and Toad books have held up well -  my oldest 'child' is 32, my youngest not yet 9, and  everyone has heard Frog and Toad stories over and over.<br />This book,  published in 1970, is the first of four.  The two friends are somewhat like  the Odd Couple, two best friends with distinctly different personalities.  Frog is usually cheerful, while Toad tends to view things from a darker  side.  In &quot;Spring&quot;, Frog convinces Toad that Spring really is  here, that it is worth it to get out of the bed where Toad's been lying for  so long his calendar still says November.<br />In &quot;The Story&quot;, Toad  (who isn't quite as much a creative thinker as Frog) struggles to think up  a story to cheer up his ailing friend - he struggles so hard that Frog ends  up comforting him!<br />&quot;A Lost Button&quot; is an amusing story about a  search for (you guessed it) a lost button - Toad's lost his button, and  Frog spends his time looking for it - they find many buttons, but not the  one Toad's looking for, which turns up back at Toad's house.  He reward his  friend by sewing him a special jacket filled with all the buttons.<br />In  &quot;A Swim&quot;, the self-conscious Toad tries to hide while putting on  his swim suit, but ends up being seen by everyone, wearing his funny  striped suit.  Even Frog laughs at him - but he manages to walk home with  dignity.<br />&quot;The Letter&quot; is the last story in this book. Like  many little children, Toad loves getting letters but is really sad because  nobody writes to him. Frog comes to the rescue, eventually, with the help  of a turtle mail carrier.<br />The stories are short, sweet and about  friendship, but in a simple manner. Drawings of Frog and Toad are on almost  every page, and are detailed enough to warrant a lengthy view and some  comments from young readers.

Once a child startsreading (with Frog and Toad Are Friends), the second, third and fourth books are welcome friends themselves.<br />This book, published in 1971, is the second of four.  Toad is a bit negative and nervous, and worries about rules, while Frog is often cheerful and dedicated to alleviating Toad's fears and doubts.<br />&quot;A List&quot; is a funny story remembered long after reading it - Toad has a list of things to do, and anything not on the list can't be done.  He loves to do something, then cross it off.  But what happens when your list blows away, and &quot;run after the list&quot; wasn't even on the list. Worse, you can't remember what else was on the list.  Frog is such a good friend, he just sits quietly with Toad as he struggles to figure out what to do.<br />In &quot;The Garden,&quot; Toad would like to have a garden like Frog has, and with Frog's encouragement, he starts one. He tries directing the garden to grow, until Frog (hearing all that shouting) gives him some advise on how to nurture a garden.<br />&quot;Cookies&quot; is probably one of the best stories. Frog and Toad make cookies, and they are so good that they can't stop eating them.  They determine its about will power, and in the end they end up with no cookies &quot;but we have lots and lots of will power.&quot; Frog says.<br />&quot;Dragons and Giants&quot; is about Frog and Toads fears and how they deal with them.  &quot;We are not afraid!&quot; Frog and Toad screamed at the same time. A funny story that children will like.<br />The last story &quot;The Dream&quot; is a bit deep - Toad is asleep and has a dream about starring in a play, while Frog sits in the audience and shrinks almost to non-existence.<br />The stories are short, sweet and about friendship, but in a simple manner.

This book has  five stories, starting and ending with Winter tales.<br />As usual, Toad is a  bit negative and nervous, while Frog is calm, positive and dedicated to  being a very good friend to Toad.<br />In &quot;Down the Hill&quot;, Frog gets  Toad to come outside and try sledding down a hill with him. Toad goes  reluctantly along, and for a moment enjoys the ride. Frog gets bumped off  the sled, and Toad still enjoys the adventure until he realizes he's alone.  He decides Winter is best spent inside.<br />The next story is about a story  told from Frog to Toad, one rainy day when they are wishing Spring was  here.  Frog promises that Spring is just around &quot;The  Corner.&quot;<br />&quot;Ice Cream&quot; is a funny story about what happens  when Toad buys ice cream cones for himself and Frog, and carries them a  long way on a very hot day.<br />&quot;The Surprise&quot; is a story about  what happens when two friends try to do something special for a friend, in  secret.<br />The last story, &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, has a worried Toad  frantically searching for his best friend, sure that something terrible has  happened.

This is the last in the series about Frog and Toad, who are different but very good friends.  Published in 1979, the two have not changed a whole lot, though the stories have gotten  funnier - droll is perhaps a better word.<br />The pessimistic Toad is  procrastinating in &quot;Tomorrow&quot; until he realizes that he's down in  the dumps because of all he has to do tomorrow - so he does it all today  and tires himself out.<br />In &quot;The Kite,&quot; Frog's optomism pays off.  &quot;Shivers&quot; has some scary tales that Frog enjoys telling, and  Toad enjoys hearing.  On Toad's birthday, in &quot;the Hat&quot; Frog gives  a present that's a little too big, but Toad insists on keeping it.  When  Frog secretly fixes the problem while Toad is sleeping, Toad believes his  head has grown.  In the final story, &quot;Alone,&quot; the two friends  learn they can still be friends, even if they are alone sometimes.<br />In  all the books, the stories are short, sweet and about friendship, but in a  simple manner.

That is an indication that some reviewers don't 'get' this book.<br />This book, one of Atwood's earlier works, was written with a great deal of metaphor symbolism etched so skillfully into the  content of the book, you may not realize that until you've reached the end,  and have an &quot;aha&quot; experience, in some ways similar (though  without the visual shock effect) to the way I felt at the end of watching  Sixth Sense (the movie).<br />  If you like Margaret Atwood, you will  greatly enjoy seeing her young mind at work, as she shows us the unraveling  mind of a young woman looking for something in the Canadian woods one  week-end.<br />This book is effective and touching if you can  move with it  - but it isn't a linear-read. The missing plot and underdeveloped  characters are not missing or underdeveloped at all -- read without that  analytical side of the brain, and the treasures will 'surface'.  Undo  expectations  and flow emotionally with it -- you won't be  disappointed.<br />(my original paperback version has $1.50 marked on it!).  The original version is falling apart, and I wanted to own another - glad  to see it is still here (oh, my but look at the price now!)	2000-06-15

The idea of a family of tiny people, living in my own house and taking, for the most practical of purposes, things we'd thought we'd lost was quite enjoyable.  The best part of the books, for me, were the descriptions of what they did  with the buttons and baubles they risked their lives to 'borrow' - (imagine  bumping into our family cat late one night while you're trying to lug a  teacup back home).<br />Because I was a young girl who thought girls could  do anything, I didn't really appreciate Arrietty's spunkiness.  As the only  child of the last Borrowers in this household, she's allowed to do many  things her own mother hadn't done as a child.  And perhaps because she can  do some things her mother couldn't, she moves a step further and does  whatever any boy could do.<br />I thought I could read these books to my 8  year old, who loves the Harry Potter series and The Wrinkle in Time books,  but these books are too difficult for little kids (even those reading at an  advanced level).<br />The language is very British and there are side  explanations that are much too lengthy.  Evidently I missed, as a pre-teen  reader,  the notion that the Borrowers might have been fabricated by the  boy who was narrating the stories. (It is rather absurd to think that they  were made up - I've lost too many socks and earrings in my lifetime, so I  know Borrowers exist.)<br />Before the John Goodman version of the movie, we  watched British video of The Borrowers and The Return of the Borrowers  (great for younger kids). It was excellent, even though the special effects  aren't where they were in the American version, the British version was  excellent.<br />For those 11 and up (to 111) this is a great series to read.	2000-06-14

Science fiction writing - for those who think it's just make-believe fantasy - allows us to explore current issues from the safe light of afar - ('cause it's just make-believe fantasy, right?) While reading, we can make  comparisons of modern racism or genocides with fictionalized aliens, and so  on....<br />In this book, there are no aliens from outer space.  This is an  alternate view of our own history and other social issues in the days of  Nazi Germany. The anonymous reviewer (&quot;Things are Not as They  Seem&quot;) has the BEST words on this book - read his/her review and then  buy the book, if you haven't!<br />Here's my story - my first husband brought  this book to me in 1968, as I lay in a hospital bed after the birth of our  son.  That's my kind of guy (though I didn't know it then!) We were barely  out of our teen years, right in the midst of some major changes in the US.<br />Fresh out of high school, I hadn't bothered to think through much, and  had grown up accepting the US's Number One Hero position in the world.<br />This book was fascinating, not just a sci fi escape, but a book that  raised questions in my very young mind, questions I wouldn't have gone to  on my own.  What would our lives have been like if the Axis had won the  war?  The book is good for the liberal-minded, though the ending is...well  - you need to read it yourself.<br />And it needs to be read and then  discussed, in order to challenge that cocky belief we hold to be true, (a  slightly masked form of global racism), that we are the chosen country.<br />It is time for someone to write on this theme again, but for now, this  is a good read.  If you liked Sinclair Lewis' &quot;It Can't Happen  Here,&quot; or if the short story &quot;The Lottery&quot; got you thinking,  you will enjoy reading this book.	2000-06-13

Who could resist the title, along with the beautiful cover? The chapters are short, and the content is a fascinating mix as our heroine, Mary Rose  O'Reilly tells us what is going on in her true life. Her sons are grown and  she's decided to work in a barn, with a young man named Ben and a lot of  sheep. She moves from the day-to-day workings of sheep work - it isn't at  all what you might think, the lovely young shepherdess herding the sheep  through the meadows. Aside from sheep sheering, there is more than some of  us need to know about sheep - I can't go into details here, but there is  something about rubber bands and the rear-end of the sheep that can only be  described within the context of the book. In addition, she moves from her  days as a Catholic novice to her life as a Quaker and a Buddhist, to her  trip to England to sing with a musical group, Sacred Harps. This is  definitely not a deep read, not the answer to a spiritual quest. If you  like well-written books which meander a bit (this IS a book by a woman  going through the some changes in her life), you will probably enjoy this  one. I've nibbled my way through this book, a chapter here, a chapter  there. It is a beautiful  book to give as a gift, perhaps to a 50-something  woman with an interest in spirituality, music and nature!  Might be great  in paperback, but that's a year away...	2000-06-13

Set in pre-Revolutionary Philadelphia, this is the story of young Peter, orphaned and then adopted - for reasons he does not understand - by a Quaker family.  He does not understand their ways - their non-violent approach, the deep reflections on what he thinks are simple, everyday  things.  When a runaway indentured servant is found by the Quaker farmer,  Peter cannot understand why this man is willing to turn her over to those  who pursue her and will bring her back to a life that seems<br />unfair.  She  escapes, but her 10 year old friend is captured, and Peter must answer his  own calling.  In the end, he and his adopted father come to understand  and appreciate each other.  The(adoptive) Quaker father is sorely  misunderstood by Peter, but also has to face some of his own short-comings.  Peter also has to stop running, and listen more intently to others.  Not a  truly excellent book, but a nice period piece, good for boys who are  dealing with similar emotion in these times, and good for girls, because  the young girl is a strong character.	2000-06-13

There are books on frugal living, cutting costs and you'll find plenty of those in here, or in any bookstore.  But let's start with the premise that 21st century life for many people - especially those who can afford to  browse the Internet, and shop on-line, is paced far too fast to be truly  enjoyable.

This book speaks for me, a relatively new Quaker without the family support mechanisms birthright Friends might take for granted! My own friends and family members ask me why I chose to become a Quaker;  acquaintances and curious visitors sometimes ask me what Quakers believe.  The former is easier to answer than the latter, but this little book  explains Friends in a welcoming manner that is easy to understand.<br />  Robert Smith touches on the history of Quakerism, his grandparents and  growing up in Moorestown, New Jersey. He wrote the book because he believes  there is a need in the world today for what he calls the compassionate  Quaker message.<br />  The author voices his belief that &quot;Quaker  values of simplicity and silent contemplation, truth and conscience, seem  more important now than ever before.&quot; He explains further. &quot;To  Quakers simplicity does not mean turning the clock back on progress or  rejecting the benefits of modern science and conveniences of modern  technology. Nor does it mean casting off one's possessions and embracing a  life of poverty. And it certainly does not mean casting off joy.&quot;<br />  With all the currently popular books on Simple Living and spirituality,  Smith's book stands out, speaking briefly and clearly in chapters titled  Silence, Worship, Truth, Simplicity, Conscience, Nonviolence, Service,  Business, Education and Family. In these brief chapters, he covers more  issues than I can fit into this review -- Quaker history, his own military  part in World War II, intermarriage, the internet, and more are within  these pages. He weaves in quotes from Jesus, Martin Luther King Junior,  Shakespeare, Rabindranath Tagore, as well as those from Friends past and  present.<br />  The chapters fit together like quilt squares. Any one  could be read and comprehended by itself, but as pieces of a whole, they  reveal much more. A simple lifestyle, not necessarily &quot;forsaking  worldy goods&quot; is connected with silent worship, bare walls, and simple  folks. He tells us of his own childhood, of Quaker cousins who had more  toys and possessions than he had, and of his own 'un-Quakerly  jealousy.&quot; A trip to Toys 'R Us to buy a checker set with his grandson  brings them down the action toys aisle, and leaves us to guess which his  grandson found more appealing. He recognizes that there are increased  difficulties these days when trying to sort out for children -- and for  ourselves -- what is necessary from what is desired. The answer is the same  as it has always been.<br />  &quot;'What do I need?' is simplicity's  fundamental questions, a question that rubs against our natural proclivity  for acquiring things, a question few of us feel ready to address. America's  favorite weekend activity is not participating in sports, gardening,  hiking, reading, visiting with friends and neighbors. It's shopping.&quot;  (pg. 54)<br />He does not preach or focus on the Bible, but writes in an open  and inclusive way about the variety within the Religious Society of  Friends.<br />  &quot;But for all their differences, Meetings  for Worship are fundamentally the same. At each Meeing, a group of  individuals gathers and, open to the word of God, waits in  attentive,expectant silence for a spark of the divine in their midst.  Sometimes it comes in words; sometimes in silence. The language of truth  can often be heard in silence, if only we know how to listen.&quot; (p. 29)<br />He closes the book with Ten Life Lessons, with explanations of each:  Seize the Present; Love Yourself, whatever faults you have, and love the  world however bad it is; Stop talking and listen to what you really know;  Play soccer; Accept the fact that our lives are only partly in our hands;  Believe in the perfectibility of yourself and society; Make your love  visible in the world through your work; Seek justice in the world, but not  in your own life; Look for the Light of God in everyone; Let your life  speak.&quot;ht of God in everyone; Let your life  speak.&quot;	2000-06-13

This is a book worth having, if only for the stunning artwork by  Illustrator Cheng-Khee Chee.  But in addition to the artwork, the story is one that is ideal for young and old.  In this story, the world begins as a  beautiful place, filled with luscious trees and colorful plants and  flowers, stuffed with a wide variety of strange and exotic creatures. They  begin talking, then discussing, then arguing over who God is. Before they  come to blows, Old Turtle offers her wisdom and  view of the future. There  is peace until God adds people to the earthly creatures, and they (we)  go  through the same argument - whose definition of God is the accurate or  better one? The  people argue, hurt each other, wars break out (stop me if  you've heard this one!).  Old Turtle  comes to the rescue again.  Diversity, God as in all of us - a wonderful book, and absolutely worth  having or giving in hardcover.	2000-06-13

(and give a copy to your kids)	This is my personal favorite in a long list of books on financial planning, although I think it caused the hairs on the back of my financial planners neck to stand up. Actually, that might be a good sign. The advice  in this book goes against everything a sensible planner says to do. The  traditional advise is to protect, nurture and grow your 'estate.'<br />  You know the bumper stickers you see that say &quot;We're Spending Our  Children's Inheritance&quot;?  This book is based on that theory, although  with a kinder philosophy behind it.  The authors recommend you<br />  1)  Quit Your Job. (virtually,not actually)Rather than leaving your job, start  thinking of yourself as an independent contractor - and make sure you do  what you like, get what you want)  The work world has changed, employers  complain about lack of employee loyalty, but will 'right size' you tomorrow<br />  2) Pay Cash - Get rid of credit card thinking and credit card debt.  This is not your father's credit card system anymore!<br />  3) Don't  Retire - The idea of putting yourself out to pasture at a given age  is as  dated as the concept of  thinking you have to grow your inheritance to  leave to your kids.<br />  4) Die Broke.  Spend your money wisely now, use  legal ways you can take care of your parents and your kids while you are  still alive.<br />The idea is not to live poor or foolishly, but to rethink  entirely why you are struggling so hard now for a tomorrow that may or may  not come.  Use your money today, to take care of yourself and your loved  ones. This book is easy to read without talking down to the reader, is full  of good advice with possible to practice wisdom.  A good investment!	2000-06-13

I'm sorry - normally I only write reviews of books I've enjoyed and found useful, but this book was such a disappointment, I have to put my two stars worth in.<br />The concept is great - I really like the notion of being  reincarnated and knowing as a new person  what you know now.  The idea of  coming back in the body of a young junkie, and then helping her out (since  you're body is definitely dead, anyway), is also interesting.<br />But after  the introduction, this book didn't go where it could have.  There are  underdeveloped characters, side plots that don't go very far before  fizzling off and a bit of incest that is, but isn't.<br />This is Laurel  Doud's first novel, and this reads like a first novel with a mediocre  editor.

In many years in the Corporate life, I wanted the Company to understand that a lot of the problems management was having were caused by...surprise!...management.  <br />This book is excellent in explaining to  those of us who hate the insanity of corporate life what is happening and  why, and possible remedies.<br />If you are working, or are listening to a  friend or loved one complain over and over about office politics and  craziness of different bosses, this book is a great read.  <br />Even the  authors, however, will tell you not to expect the Company to listen.  They  might nod and buy the book, pass them around HR and so on, but in essence,  most mid- to large-sized corporations are so big that their dysfunctional  behavior cannot be taken apart without the whole thing unfolding. (Or at  least, that's what they believe, and so the urge to hold on).<br />The CEO of  a dysfunctional company won't appreciate the insight that each company is  as healthy or as ill as their top leader - the further away she/he gets  from the goings on, the less s/he may be aware of this, and the less  willing to hear this.<br />My advise is to read the book but expect no  &quot;cures&quot;. Reading this book helped my sanity (I took early  retirement).  Anyone suffering inside a corporation can start questioning,  seriously, if they want to stay in this dysfunctional &quot;family&quot;  (there may not be much of a choise)and if they can get out, start planning.   Even if retirement or leaving is years away, planning helps. Get a life  outside the Company. Also read &quot;Crazy Bosses&quot; and other books by  Anne Wilson Schaef.	2000-06-13

My boredom evaporated immediately, though I don't usually spend time reading 'books like this' -  coffee table books always seem like a waste of time, money spent for a  quick flip through a soon-to-be dusty book.<br />This isn't a book you can  shuffle through, and it probably won't gather dust because it's really a  treasure of reproductions of little hand-written letters women have written  to each other over years gone by - mothers to daughters, daughters to  mothers, sisters to each other, friends-to-friends and (yes, I think)  occasionally a lover-to-lover.<br />Mary Shelley, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jane  Austen, Emily Dickenson, Louise May Alcott and others have letters.  In  addition, there are pages of quotes from other exchanges.<br />But the  amazing thing is that the stationery, the script, even the envelopes are  reproductions of the actual writings, and so look genuine - they are tucked  throughout the book in tiny envelopes, printed or hand-written as the  originals one.<br />Each letter has a transcript in the back, as the  'originals' may be difficult to read due to script styles or language  (Marie Antoinette's letter en francaise to her mother is, of course, in  French - loose sheets in calligraphy, folded inside a larger piece of  paper).<br />This would be a wonderful gift for a sister, mother, daughter,  friend, especially if she's interested in history as the letters and the  rest of the content of the book have information about the times of each  letter writer.<br />If this book is available in paperback, don't get it - the  hardcover is the one!	2000-06-13

I'd read it several years ago and it was helpful in getting me to get outside myself, and change my attitude a bit (oh, what a helpless victim of circumstance and other  people's actions I'd been!)<br />Later, I ordered up several copies to hand  out.  When I was an executive, other women would sometimes come to me with  complaints about who did this to them, and why they were helpless to  change.  Everything I suggested had a 'Yeah, but...&lt;sigh&gt;' attached  to it.  Before I hit my mid-40's, I was caught in the drama, feeling  responsible and depressed by their circumstnaces.<br />Then I started handing  out copies of the book. I'm sure many thought I was nuts, but a couple have  actually gotten the message.<br />I'm not a tough-minded broad, but a  bleeding heart liberal who finally realized you can help a fellow  working-woman to grow not by solving her problems, but by supporting her as  she learns she can do it herself.<br />The language in the book (really a  booklet) is based on &quot;As A Man Thinketh&quot;, but altered just  slightly for women.  It is invigorating to realize that what is true for  the gander is true for the goose.<br />Don't be put off by the style -  &quot;Woman is buffetted by circumstances so long as she believes herself  to be the creature of outside conditions, but when she realizes that she is  a creative power, and that she may command the hidden soil and sees of her  being out of which circumstances grow, she then becomes the rightful master  of herself.&quot;<br />Oh yes! So, here's the message - what you think and do  greatly affects what happens to you.  You aren't the victim you think you  are, so move on!<br />&quot;As A Man Thinketh&quot; and &quot;As I  Think&quot; are also available.	2000-06-13

This book reminds me a little of Scott Savage's book (A Plain Life: Walking My Belief), although the author is not a Quaker.  Reading one chapter in another book was  enough to draw me to this title.<br />At 37,  Mike McIntyre was an established journalist, with a good job in San  Francisco, a girlfriend, a nice apartment.  His job enabled him to travel  all over the world, but he felt moved to leave it all behind, and travel by  the grace of others from the West Coast to Cape Fear, North Carolina.  He  feels he's a coward, that he's afraid to take a gamble with  anything...neither of these being words that describe Quakers.  But his  feeling that an inner voice is telling him to do this, and his conviction  to go ahead despite less than encouraging words from his family  (&quot;you'll get raped,&quot; his own grandmother tells him) are, to me, a  spiritual calling.  He says he will not take money, not even if he finds it  on the road in front of him.  He sets out, wary but determined to go.  Like  Scott Savage's need to turn over his already expired driver's license,  McIntrye has picked his destination as a symbolic gesture.  &quot;If I make  it to Cape Hope,&quot; he says, &quot;it will be as a different man from  the one who starts the journey.  I am afraid.&quot;<br />Right out the door,  he finds himself a fill-in guest house on a talk show (&quot;Life in the  Country&quot;) on a local radio station.  He isn't alone as a guest - his  new partner is a tall, blond with red lipstick and high heels, a  firefighter named Diana, who used to be named Dennis.  The book is full of  strange encounters, and is an interesting read, to put it mildly.	2000-06-13

Although the lead character in the first two books is  a girl, Meg Murry, her younger, gifted brother Charles Wallace, plays a  major role in all stories, especially the third book. There is a subtle  message that I totally missed when I first read these books, some 20 odd  years ago, a nice mixture of fantasy, life's meaning, and Meg's difficulty  with her hot temper, which (in same situations) has some very positive  value.  The Murrys are real, loving and likeable.  Author Madeline  L'Engle uses the characters and the stories, to convey to us thoughts about  good and evil, and the strength of a good spirit. You really need to read  them in order, so try out the first one.  This is an excellent family read  together series.	2000-06-13

Child: 50 Ways Improve your Child's Behavior attn Span w/o Drugs Labels or Coercion	Books	4	262	267	N	N	Not for those who think medication is	...the answer. He has good reasons why we (parents of kids diagnosed as ADD) should really examine medication and other solutions. I am glad I bought this book.<br /> Before heading right to the 50 Ways, Armstrong offers  the reader five chapters filled with information, positive and negative,  about ADD and medication, the whys and wherefores. He starts with reasons  why he doesn't believe in A.D.D as a medical problem, treatable primarily  by medication.<br />As he says in this review area, he is NOT saying ADD  doesn't exist - he acknowledges that the problems we experience with our  kids are real. What I believe he IS saying is that he doesn't believe the  'disease' diagnosed as A.D.D. is a medical problem only within the child,  curable by medication.<br />He suggests that some of the problem may be  cultural - we expect our children at the age of 6 to be able to sit quietly  in a classroom setting - other cultures allow children more freedom, some  offer less.  Changes in our own &quot;short attention span&quot; culture  may contribute to the A.D.D. behaviors, as do boring classroom set-ups,  gender differences, different learning styles, parent-child dis-connections  and so on.<br />He tells what is good, and not good about the pills - some of  which may be the same as a placebo effect. When parents and teachers know  the child is being medicated, they relax and that change of attitude has a  positive effect on the child (I have seen this with my own child and his  teachers).<br />He writes more about the negative effects of Ritalin (not  Adderall) as perhaps stifling creativity and the dependency factor,  although he is clear that there is no answer yet (however, both Ritalin and  Adderall are controlled substances and many children do have negative  'withdrawal' effects).  Despite his discussion on drugs, he says &quot;Such  drugs, used in the right way with the right individuals by responsible  physicians, can significantly enhance the quality of life for many  children.&quot;  But he limits this to three situations - 1) several  hyperactive children 2) children in the midst of a life-changing trauma  (death in the family, for example) 3) a last resort.<br />After some 50  pages of this introduction, you get to the reason you bought the book -  alternative solutions and they are good (whether or not your child is on  medication).  He starts with a checklist of things that may bother you  about your child's behavior - each one checked off directs you to at least  one chapter with possible solutions.<br /> Examples include: Runny nose,  itching, stomachache - go to Chapter 2 and look at the Feingold Diet, or  Chapter 12 ideas to help alleviate what may be an allergy problem; play  Nintendo for two or three hours at a time, go to Chapter 3 and consider  limiting TV and video games or Chapter 36, giving your child access to a  computer (he misses, on this one, his own Chapter #5, find out what really  interests your child - the one I've found most effective - piano, riding  lessons, reading, outside play with friends really are more appealing when  encouraged by a parent!).  Each of these chapters has information, which  many of us have already read - but he also provides resources at the end of  the chapter which I am finding helpful. And let me once again point out, he  has 50 (5-0!) ideas neatly arranged in one book - I especially like that  you can look at the list of your child's particular problems and go right  to the chapter, rather than trying to read all the way through, cover to  cover.<br />For those who believe that medication is a strong, necessary and  large part of the solution, or for those who do not have the time, money or  emotional resources to examine the &quot;whys&quot; of ADD, the first part  of the book more of an annoyance than a help.<br />If so, I'd still encourage  people to read this book, pages 61 - 257.e for many  children.&quot;  But he limits this to three situations - 1) several  hyperactive children 2) children in the midst of a life-changing trauma  (death in the family, for example) 3) a last resort.   <br />After some 50  pages of this introduction, you get to the reason you bought the book -  alternative solutions and they are good (whether or not your child is on  medication).

Anyone who is aware of current news and political issues and history, will find this book, written in the 1930's, to be astonishing.  I read this in high school, and remembered it years later  when I was putting books on my web page.  Why did I remember it? Sinclair  Lewis wrote this long before the world became aware of what was going on in  Nazi Germany. This illustrates the often ignored fact that we can tell what  is going on around us, if only we listen to the signs and signals, and stop  burying our heads in..oh, well, in books and the internet and TV shows.  He  takes the story to America, where people's response to what's going on in  the world is &quot;It Can't Happen Here&quot; (not that any of us would say  that these days...). Anything that Can't Happen Here, then, isn't our  problem.  Until, of course, it happens here...<br />This is a good book to  read if you like messages in your fiction - (did you enjoy reading  &quot;The Lottery?&quot;)	2000-06-13

The road to a near-workerless economy is within sight. Whether that road leads to a safe haven or a terrible abyss will depend on how well civilization  prepares for the post-market era that will follow on the heels of the Third  Industrial Revolution. The end of work could spell a death sentence for  civilization as we have come to know it. The end of work could also signal  the beginning of a great social transformation, a rebirth of the human  spirit. The future lies in our hands.\\"<br />Thus ends the book, leaving no  neat little answers - negative OR positive, but urging us to open our eyes  and look around us.  I'd seen him on C-span and promptly ordered his book  through Amazon.  This was when it first came out in hardcover and my oldest  son, assured of a future work using skills from his newly obtained Masters  in Computer Science, was concerned I was reading such a book. \\"Isn't he one  of those Luddites?\\" I think of myself as a wanna be Luddite, but I saw no  signs of this in the book. Instead, Rifkin seems to be concerned with the  coming affects of the Informational Revolution.<br />The book begins with a  history of the Industrial Revolution. He gives us a nice tour of the birth  of materialism as a concept created and promoted by economists and  businessmen. \\"The term `consumption,\\" he tells us, \\"has both English and  French roots. In its original form, to consume meant to destroy, to  pillage, to subdue, to exhaust. It is a word steeped in violence and until  the present century had only negative connotations.\\"<br />The chapter,  \\"Technology and the Afro-American Experience,&quot; addresses the effects  of slavery, the supposed freedom of sharecropping, the loss of jobs as a  consequence of the invention of the mechanical cotton picker, the rush to  the cities and the subsequent loss of jobs as technology slowly progressed.  There is a correlation to the success of whichever modern day technology we  are experiencing, and the situation in the inner-cities. \\"Today, millions  of African-Americans find themselves hopelesly trapped in a permanent  underclass. Unskilled and unneeded, the commodity value of their labor has  been rendered virtually useless by the automated technologies that have  come to displace them in the new high-tech global economy.&quot;<br />One  chapter is entitled \\"No More Farmers\\" and discusses the advances of  robotizing replacing tasks such as harvesting and livestock management, as  well as the end of outdoor agriculture. Other chapters deal with the future  for retail, service, blue collar jobs, the declining middle class and the  growing chasm between the haves and the have-nots.<br />In the chapter  titled, \\"A More Dangerous World,\\" he cites the Merva and Fowles study,  saying that it \\"showed a striking correlation between growing wage  inequality and increased criminal activity.\\" \\"Rising unemployment and loss  of hope for a better future are among the reasons that tens of thousands of  young teenagers are turning to a life of crime and violence.\\"<br />He does  point out that the explosion of the Third Revolution is going to make the  social wounds we've tried to heal seem like paper cuts, but does not claim  that we should unhook our computers and resist the revolutionary explosion.  His suggestion is that we work on `empowering' the Third Sector' - the  independent sector - and turn back to community, to helping each other  before it is too late. \\" A new generation might transcend the narrow limits  of nationalism and begin to think and act as common memebers of the human  race, with shared commitments to each other, the community, and the larger  biosphere.\\"  He does offer that since hi-tech advances may mean fewer jobs  in the market economy, the only way to make sure those whose jobs are lost  will be compensated is to have the government supply compensation.  Naturally, this gives a flash-back to the welfare system, which I think has  freaked out a few reviewers, paralyzing them into a sort of retro response.  But Rifkin isn't just talking about the recipients of old - those  stereotypical lower-income, under-educated inner city folks, he's talking  about many more people. In my family, my middle son is a hands on kind of  worker who in the past might have been a farmer. No matter how much  education he gets, he isn't one of those who will sit well in the new  techno age, and already he's feeling the pressures. The high paying jobs  for him are life-threatening, so the kind of work he's hired for is low  paying, not enough to support himself, let alone the family he has decided  he can't afford to start.  Rifkin isn't doing retro work - he suggests  tying the subsidized income to service in the community, which he suggests  migh help the &quot;growth and development of the social economy and  facilitate the long-term transition into a community-centered,  service-oriented culture.\\"<br />His answers are not clearly spelled out - he  offers suggestions and insight into where we might be going as a race (the  human race). The truth is, we all need to ask some questions and help find  the answers.  For those whose minds are set firmly in any direction, you'll  get from this book very little - for those with open minds, regardless of  your political view of the world, you may find this to be a door to the  future.e system, which I think has  freaked out a few reviewers, paralyzing them into a sort of retro response.

Eight hundred thousand men, women and children were killed in a hundred days in Rwanda in the spring of 1994, most of them in the first 50 days. These killings were acts of incredible violence by otherwise ordinary  people, neighbors, friends, co-workers, classmates and sometimes family  members of the victims. How could such a thing have happened?<br />  The  author, a staff writer for the New Yorker, offers as an explanation for why  he was so curious about Rwanda, that &quot;The best reason I have come up  with for looking closely into Rwanda's stories is that ignoring them makes  me even more uncomforable about existence and my place in it.&quot;  Gourevitch holds that the genocide in Rwanda was not a spontaneous,  emotional response to years of bad history, but part of a long and planned  out process. This was not a brewing madness that came over the Hutus, nor  simply the result of years of disagreements with another race living in the  same country. Instead, it was a political plan of the same nature as the  Final Solution in Nazi Germany.<br />  Although I have listened to, spoken  with and even written a little about our Friend, Amminadab Munyaneza (in a  local newsletter - Amminadab was in a Master's program in my home town), I  never quite understood what had happened in Rwanda. When I saw this book I  thought it might offer answers to questions I've had for years. Why do  people do such things? What can we do to change the situation? Surely  someone must have known what was going to happen.<br />  The book was an  intriguing, sad and useful read, a mixture of history, true stories  including at least one hero, and the author's own outrage. Greed, politics  and fear were key components, along with the abandonment of Rwanda by the  UN and its supporting countries. I learned a little - I was not aware that  the refugee camps Amminidab spoke of held more Hutus than Tutsis (for most  of the Tutsis had been murdered), that many of those who committed  atrocities were mixed in with those who had not, that the Tutsis who  survived sought revenge, often on Hutus who had done no harm, that the  murders (Hutus of Tutsis; Tutsis of Hutus) were still going on well into  1998.<br />  The recent awareness of problems in Kosovo have made it sadly  clear that `racial cleansing' and genocide are still among us. And so the  questions increase. Will Rwanda ever be healed? Will Kosovo? Is it possible  for this to happen anywhere? What can we do, can I do?<br />  Reading this  book did not answer the questions, but it a little clarity to what  happened.ed  atrocities were mixed in with those who had not, that the Tutsis who  survived sought revenge, often on Hutus who had done no harm, that the  murders (Hutus of Tutsis; Tutsis of Hutus) were still going on well into  1998. <br />     The recent awareness of problems in Kosovo have made it sadly  clear that `racial cleansing' and genocide are still among us.

Some of us confuse this with the `simpler life' we hear about, a supposedly easier, leisure-filled life thanks to modern technology. As many have noticed, the  technology we use in hopes of giving us more free time actually gives us  more time to do more `stuff', often with more stuff. There can be an  emptiness that comes along with all of the stuff, extra time some of us  seek to fill with more activities and more stuff. What seems to be most  lacking is a connection with people, with our community.<br />  Giving up a driver's license is no small thing. Being able to drive an  automobile in our society means independence - teen-agers and the elderly  particularly find getting or maintaining possession of a driver's license  paramount to their quality of life. But they aren't alone. If you do not  drive, but travel by foot, bicycle or horse and buggy, you realize your  world both shrinks and expands. Physically, it consists of places and  events that are close enough to get to within a day. It expands because  that smaller surrounding must be more filled with community, and the people  you are more dependent upon.<br />  Although he and his wife became  Quakers in the beginning of their journey, most of what he writes about  community comes from their experiences with the Amish families they first  lived near.<br />This kind of community didn't exist at all if it only  existed in one's mind, as for example in a computer-driven `virtual  community.'&quot;<br />&quot;Unlike pretend or fantasy communities, the real  one we were learning from wasn't filled with folks hand-picked for their  similarities. They did not necessarily really, really like one another, nor  completely share the same interests.&quot;<br />  I thought if I read the  book, I'd feel compelled to change my life completely, or to feel bad about  the life I live. Instead, it gave me the opportunity to do a lot of  reflective thinking, and to find ways and reasons to question how I am  living my life, and to find small ways of changing it for the better. I  found myself wishing I had the riches Scott Savage has, the family, the  community, life partner, the strength of character, the determination to do  without the things that seem to fill up my life, and that of my youngest  son.hinking, and to find ways and reasons to question how I am  living my life, and to find small ways of changing it for the better.

Yes, it is true, I paid full price in a real world bookstore.  The perils of impulse buying are rewarded sometimes by  treasures.  This book has chapter after chapter of interesting  articles by a variety of travelers who find some spiritual message in their  journeys.  Amazon leaves out the part of the chapter that makes this sound  like a spiritual book (&quot;transformation&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;),  calling it True Stories of Life on the Road, but I have the book in my  hands, and the title is as shown above.  There is no 'new age' feeling to  the stories, nor are there tons of meetings with angels.  Instead, there  are true, perhaps slightly odd, stories of encounters with one's own inner  being, through travel experiences.  Each chapter is by a different, often  well-known traveler or writer - the writing is of an excellent quality.  In  one chapter, a man far away from his wife through miles and emotional  connection has a frightening event and calls his wife.  But before he can  tell her the details, she tells him of a dream she had.  Her dream is not  an exact rendition of his event, but so close that it is clear they were  connected. Other stories may tell of spiritual adventures, ventures that  changed a life, or life, death, worship practices in other lands.	2000-06-13

This book offers her a  comfortable entrance. To those who underrate it because this book doesn't  fit their needs, I would ask that they do as the Dalai Lama does -  recognize there is more than one doorway to peace, tranquility and  illumination. I was impressed in this book to find that rather than passing  judgments, the Dalai Lama had answers for non-Buddhists and athiests  (non-believers)who are looking for 'happiness'.  For many comfortable with  the Western way (psychotherapy), this book will offer an opportunity to  seek and find true happiness.	2000-03-10
