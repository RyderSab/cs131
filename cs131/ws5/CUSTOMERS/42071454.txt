I have a busy life, sometimes larger novels can take me quite some time to accomplish.  This book, I basically sat down and read in just a couple sittings.   The main character in this novel showed what it was like to love and be loved, and how love can overcome all time.  Normally that would turn me off about a novel, but there was an actual story surrounding it.  A life that you could get yourself drawn into and appreciate the words on the page for.  It was a very moving novel and I can not wait to pass it on to my friends to enjoy.  I can't wait to read another book by what is becoming one of my favourite authors.	2005-08-11

I could simply not put it down, and my day was marked for how long it was until I could find out what happens next.  I wanted the ending to come to see how things played out, but when it came I wanted more.  For the end I was at university waiting for class to start, and I felt so stupid because I was trying so hard to not cry at the end.  And, I never cry at books.  This book was so fabulous, do read it, I recommend it to anyone.	2004-11-10

I have always loved the story of King Arthur, and to hear if from the woman's point of view was fascinating.  It really showed a side of King Arthur that we may miss if we were listening to a &quot;guys&quot; telling of the story.  I have to admit, Morgaine fascinated me!  She was so different from what I have come to expect of women back in the days of Knights!  She actually was more like women of today, trapped in the past.  I think that of all the women of Avalon.  Then, there is the Queen's wife!  I spent the whole book wishing she was not alive.  She has to be the most annoying person in the world, I am sorry!  She needs to go away.  Everyone else lived up to my expectations.  I am just glad that I discovered this book, it opened new doorways for me, that's for sure!	2003-08-20

I just had a feeling, so I splurged.  I have never honestly read Margaret Atwood before, just nothing I have ever picked up.  This book sparked my interest though.  It is strange to see how one person, or one small group of people, can be the end of the Earth as we know it.  You also think about genetics, could all our manipulation be our downfall?  I really think this book could happen, in a way, so it is really scary to read.  It causes you to think about what just may happen if we don't change the way that we live.  Just think about that...	2003-08-20

It tells the life story of the main character, as if she was writing her autobiography.  In this book, the author captures exactly what it was like for a woman growing up in todays, and the past, society.

The way the author, Isabel Allende, uses wording makes the book come to live in more ways then one.  You can actually imagine that you are a character in the book, feeling the hardships that they are dealt during this period in time. (The California gold rush)  It's one of those books you can learn from, plus enjoy an enticing story about hardships and love.  An excellent read!	2001-12-28

I later tracked down this boxed-set and I continue to collect her books 3 years later.  She is one of the best authors I have ever read, and I read a lot, so if you haven't read her, do.  You won't regret it!	2001-12-28

One of the greatest things about this book is that in some ways you can relate to the character.  All of Madeleine L'Engle's characters are like that.  You can almost see some aspect of your self in all of her books.  This one I highly recommend!	2001-12-28
