In them, we are given the tools we need to live life in a new way--free from fear and guilt, and open to the possibilities life presents.  Most importantly, they instruct us not to force our ideas on one another, but rather to grant others the freedom to make up their own minds.  By this example of tolerance, we can use our lives to heal the divisions between us, and remind ourselves of Who We Really Are.	2003-03-29

The beauty and power of the Walsch books is that they say so much with so little.  A wonderful example of this is the sentence on page 260 of The New Revelations...\\"When inner peace is attained, outer peace becomes possible at last.\\"  Could we ever hope to find words more applicable to our present world crisis, or how to resolve it!!!	2003-02-03

I can't believe that some people can't see the beauty they contain.  These are the people living in the darkness who need to be reminded of who they really are.  This is the time for all people who appreciate the wisdom contained in these books to demonstrate with their lives the truth of our oneness.  There is no separation from anyone or anything.  Only the living of this truth can change the path our planet is now on.  I sincerely hope that inner peace will be found by all...for this is the experience of oneness with god and with all of life...and it is the only thing that can save our world.	2002-03-31

I have written a number of reviews of the Walsch series, but just can't seem to get enough of hearing what others have to say about these marvelous books.  So...here I find myself writing yet another review...inspired again as I am by the reviews of others.  Perhaps the message I keep hearing is that I can never adequately do justice to these books no matter how many reviews that I write.  I just can't seem to put into words how magnificent and beautiful are the messages it contains.  The only words that come to mind...holy, holy, holy.	2002-03-18

I also love to come online to look at all the reviews on this website, and even write one or two myself.  I am especially heartened by those reviews which speak favorably of these books.  In fact, I refuse to read a review with anything less than 5 stars any more.  Perhaps this is my own judgementalness and intolerance creeping in...:)  Unlike me, I doubt Jesus would have had a problem hearing about the beliefs of others...even those unlike his own. I am sure that he had a very small ego, and would not have been threatened simply by someone's differing  point-of-view. To the contrary, Jesus would have embraced these contrary opinions, not rejected them.  He understood that what the world really needed were voices of peace, and examples of tolerance and unconditional love.  In the end, I must come to terms with my own contribution toward a more harmonious and joyful planet. I must ask myself the question...\\"Is mine a light that can truly light the world?\\"	2002-02-10

He lived 500 years ago in Europe, at a time when Martin Luther and the Reformation was taking shape in Europe.  It was also a dangerous time when any opposition to the Catholic church could result in death at the hands of the Inquisition.  Servetus had revolutionary ideas which flew in the face of religious dogma of the day, and published these controversial views for all to see.  Needless to say, he immediately became a serious threat to the Catholic church. He was captured, but managed to escape from prison, and lived a number of years longer under an assumed name.  Eventually, however, he was found out, arrested, tried, and convicted of heresy in Geneva.  He was burned at the stake, and died a martyr for his beliefs.  <BR>Isn't it wonderful that we can read a book like Conversations with God, and not have to fear for our lives today?  But, in another sense, isn't it frightening how little we have changed from those days when any voice of opposition had to be silenced, sometimes in the most brutal of ways?	2002-02-02

Add to that its joy, fun, humor, and lightheartedness and you have something pretty good on your hands.  I will be reading this book for the rest of my life...especially when life deals out more than I feel capable of dealing with.  At times like these I find nuggets of Truth which help to ease my mind...bringing peace and acceptance to the situation at hand.  &quot;Know that what you do in the time of your greatest trial can be your greatest triumph.&quot;  Yes...God is with us through it all...we need only remember that.	2001-06-04

I desire now to live these wonderful truths with each moment of my life.  They are deceptively simple ideas which hold within them the power to change everything.  I believe the essence of Neale's message is &quot;peace&quot;.  When each of us can find peace within ourselves, we can begin to heal the divisions which have damaged our planet.  May we all embrace one another as the gods and goddesses we truly are, and together we can create a more loving and joyful world.	2001-04-30

Like the other Walsch books, this one speaks to my heart in a way that no book ever has.  It's hard to pinpoint exactly what, in its contents, produces such an impact, but I only know how my experience has changed from reading it. I now feel that anyone can live as an enlightened master with the help of these books.  I recommend them to anyone who is dissatisfied with what they've been seeing in their lives, and for those who desire to be the conscious cause of that change.	2001-02-09

After reading the CWG trilogy and Friendship With God, I &quot;know&quot; this next volume will be just as exciting and wonderful!!!  I don't quite know how to put into words what these books have meant to me in my life.  Their message is so positive, uplifting, compassionate, courageous, and truthful that I am simply left shaking my head in amazement...:)  I think if we ever needed to hear these words, this is the time.  For so many years has the human race done all it can to destroy all that is truly sacred and beautiful about life.  Perhaps now we can wake up and possibly rebuild some of this precious place we have always loved and called our home.	2000-09-27

That is why I  am so grateful for Neale's latest book.....Friendship with God.  Its  emphasis on &quot;getting out of our minds&quot; so we can experience  ourselves as the Masters we are,was just what I needed to hear.

I've never read anything written so powerfully and brilliantly as these books.  They finally give us permission to lighten up  a bit and enjoy the ride.  The often hilarious dialogue seems to jolt us  from our doom-and-gloom outlooks--opening us to a Perfection which is  limitless and all-encompassing.  To live these Truths is to find peace  within.  To know one is loved without condition is to be free of the fear  and guilt which so often rule our lives.  It is time for a new gospel of  goodness, oneness, and love.  May we choose to joyously express these  Divine qualities of Self so that we might again re-member Who We Really  Are.	2000-07-14

Some people want to debate whether these books are or are notdivinely inspired, but I'm not interested in that.

Just as I listen to my favorite CD's repeatedly, I also read and reread these pages...each time with a new perspective.  So it really doesn't concern me where these words are coming from.
