The book would also prove helpful for client reading, as well as widows and children who find themselves suddenly and maybe unexpectedly inheriting a business.    Very well researched by two seasoned professionals, Richard E. Jackim and Peter G. Christman, The $10 Trillion Opportunity walks clients who are in the possible position of selling or merging their business through every step of the way.  The wording is easy to understand, but doesn't speak down to the reader. The book is wonderful for making it perfect for family members on the periphery of a sell or merger operation.  Case studies provide highlights throughout the book, and add clarification to the actual text.    The book has 221 pages, with 24 chapters.   It's indexed in a completely thorough manner.  Each of the chapters is broken down into very small sections;  I believe that each page has a good stopping point.  This isn't the type of book that you just sit down and read from cover-to-cover; rather, it's meant to be studied and digested, so plan to take your time.    Richard E. Jackim is an attorney and investment banker.  A graduate of Cornell Law School, he has been involved in more than sixty mergers or acquisitions of middle market companies.  After working ten years in investment banking, Richard Jackim co-founded The Christman Group, LLC, a middle market investment banking firm based in Illinois.    Peter G. Christman is an entrepreneur, corporate executive and investment banker, working with such well-known companies as Ford and Xerox.  He founded and ran an investment banking firm, during which time he developed his unique Exit Planning Coach process.  Together with Richard E. Jackim, he co-founded The Christmas Group, LLC.    If you or your clients will ever be in a position to sell or merge a business, make sure you read The $10 Trillion Opportunity before you make any steps that can't be revoked.  From what I've read, this is really the definitive book on this topic.    Rebecca Henderson   Allbooks Reviews	2005-09-23

While I don't quite agree with all of the theology presented, it is very obvious that Mrs. Drayton is very passionate about her beliefs, as well as the sharing of those beliefs with all who will listen.  She is quite generous in sharing examples from her own life in Silent Speaker. <br /> <br />The book has 110 pages, with 9 chapters.  All of the chapters are broken into smaller segments;  the print is quite large, with spacing between the lines - great for older eyes!  There are many quotes from the Bible in Silent Speaker, as you would expect.  They quotes are from the King James Version of the Bible; I would have found Silent Speaker easier to read, follow and comprehend had the author used a more modern translation. <br /> <br />Evelyn Murray Drayton is an ordained minister and author.  She and her husband, Russell, live in Georgetown, South Carolina.  Together they have two sons, Justin and Nicholas. <br /> <br />	2005-09-17

But when most of those residents go together on The Letter Writer's cruise to Hawaii, things suddenly start to change. <br /> <br />The Letter Writer is a wonderful novel, with just enough complexity to make it interesting and hold your attention, but not so much that the characters get mixed up in your mind.  Novels like The Letter Writer are my favorite; I call them great airplane books, because they're so fascinating they hold your interest through late and delayed flights, turbulence, crying babies and roaring jet engines.   <br /> <br />Mercer-Nairne skillfully weaves together the life circumstances of several characters.  Until the middle of the book, you wonder where he's going with his characters, but then you begin to see just what he has in mind.  It's not until the epilogue, however, that you find out all of the many twists and turns, most of them very surprising, that have taken place in the book. <br /> <br />The book has 351 pages, with 57 chapters, plus an epilogue;  none of the chapters are very long, but several of them are further divided.  This is one of the things that makes The Letter Writer great reading in my opinion;  while it's certainly written so that it can be picked up and put down, you won't want to do that.  You'll want to read it as fast as possible.   <br /> <br />I think The Letter Writer would make a fabulous movie, but at any rate, I'm looking for more novels from Mr. Mercer-Nairne. <br /> <br />	2005-08-22

The Company She Keeps by Diana Reynolds Chambers is a wonderful book that you shouldn't expect to be able to put down until you're finished with it.  Starting in the small, sleepy town of Alert, North Carolina and ending on the beaches of Bali, there's action everywhere in between! <br /> <br />Most of the action centers around E, short for Evelyn.  She's a young girl from Alert, moves to Washington, and on from there to even more exciting places.  Throughout the pages of The Company She Keeps, E becomes romantically involved with 3 spies, finally marrying one. <br /> <br />The Company She Keeps is filled with romance, mystery, heart-break and even some geography and social studies lessons.

Franzmeier's mystery novel, TheTwins, has its beginnings in Minnesota during the late 1930's, in the days leading up to World War II.  The main character, Al Freitag, has a promising career in law enforcement.  His wife, Tillie, is a social worker attending graduate school.   <br />  <br />The Twins is a riveting mystery.  It's a follow-up to Mr. Franzmeier's first book, The Spiral Bridge; several of the characters, especially Al and Tillie Freitag, are in both books.  Orville Switzer, a young teenager who's a slow learner, again faces tragedy in The Twins.  Orville endears himself to nearly everyone with his sweet personality. <br /> <br />In order to try to figure out who murdered two young women (who are The Twins), Al goes undercover as a truck driver.  Al's suspicions that the transportation company owner is involved in the murders prove correct.  As we read further in the book, we find that the businessman, Teddy Banks, is involved in much, much more. <br /> <br />A bit of romance occurs in the book as Tillie's mother, Iva, and Teddy become romantically involved, much to everyone's consternation.  As he did in The Spiral Bridge, writer Franzmeier skillfully combines the good versus evil theme in The Twins.  Complex questions regarding searching and finding God's peace permeate the book. <br /> <br />Make sure you read the books in the order in which they're written.  Although they could be enjoyed when read in the reverse order, I think they would offer more entertainment when read in the order written. <br /> <br />The book has 224 pages that are divided into 31 chapters.   Several of the chapters are further divided into smaller sections.  As with The Spiral Bridge, after you begin reading The Twins, your attention will be riveted until you're finished.  I read The Twins in one evening. <br /> <br />Just as in The Spiral Bridge, Mr. Franzmeier has done a fantastic job of developing the main and supporting characters.  Many of the characters speak with a German accent;  Mr. Franzmeier did another wonderful job of writing in the dialect when appropriate.  When I've read some books that lapse into dialects, I find myself having difficulty in being able to figure out what's being said.  That's definitely not the case here! <br /> <br />The Twins is an enjoyable mystery; your thinking is challenged.  I'd love to see this book made into a movie!  <br /> <br />	2005-06-03

Franzmeier's debut mystery novel, The Spiral Bridge, has its beginnings in Minnesota during the 1930's, in the midst of the Great Depression.  The main character, Tillie Tilden, is between her junior and senior years in college.  She is contemplating if she should take a job in the Minnesota farm country teaching in a one-room schoolhouse, in exchange for her senior year of college.  Most of the book is set in the rural setting of the farm country, although some is set in St. Paul.  The Spiral Bridge tells of Tillie's adventures during her first year of teaching. <br />  <br />The Spiral Bridge is not only a mystery, it's a romance, too.  Writer Franzmeier skillfully combines the best elements of each genre.  In the pages of the book, we become well acquainted with Tillie, and before long, she meets her boyfriend, Al, who quickly becomes a main character. Tillie is troubled by her mother's feelings toward Al.  Her father, a veterinarian employed as a meat inspector, is a farmer at heart, as Al is in actuality;  he's much in favor of their relationship. Tillie's mother, however, has no use for farmers.  What a conflict!   <br /> <br />But that's not the main plot.  Helen, the teacher who taught in the small school a year before Tillie came, killed herself.  Why?  Many questions are raised concerning this.  The author develops a wonderful plot line between Methodist, Lutheran and Catholic beliefs not only about suicide, but about other theological lessons as well.  Your thinking will be challenged! <br /> <br />The book has 214 pages that are divided into 25 chapters.  After you begin reading The Spiral Bridge, you won't want to put it down.  I read it in two evenings and part of one afternoon. <br /> <br />Alvin Franzmeier has done a wonderful job of developing the main characters, as well as the supporting ones.  While suspenseful in many sections, this isn't the type of book that made me afraid to go to sleep at night - I sure don't like those!  The chapters led easily from one to the next; there was never any question about how each character was related (in the story, not necessarily by blood) to another.   Some of the characters carried an accent from either their or their parents' native (European) countries; the author did a wonderful job of writing in the dialect when appropriate.  In reading some books that lapse into dialects, I find myself hardly being able to figure out what's being said.  Not the case in The Spiral Bridge!    <br /> <br />The Spiral Bridge is a fabulous mystery; like any good mystery, the plot takes a complete turn close to the very end. I'm looking for more good reading from Mr. Franzmeier! <br /> <br />	2005-05-30

Wow! What a story! Shirley Cheng is most definitely someone who sees the glass of water as being half full, rather than even partially empty. She is living proof that someone can be happy, live a fulfilling life that matters to many others, in spite of severe physical pain, being legally blind and living life out of a wheelchair. <br />In the midst of pain and not knowing what medical calamity would next happen to her, Shirley has devoted her life to making the most of what she has. Her extraordinary intelligence (being at the very top of her class) is topped only by her determination to succeed and not to allow the constant unwanted companion of pain, the harshness of blindness and the inconvenience of confinement to a wheelchair determine the course of her life. <br />With her subtitle, &quot;A Young Woman's Autobiography of a 20-Year Tale of Trials and Tribulations,&quot; Shirley has clearly illustrated the details of the patience required for learning to do tasks most of us take for granted. While she had her vision, the circumstances of her life have probably made her more aware than most of us are of the some of the very simple pleasures of life. I practically cried when she wrote of the beauty of a pattern of fabric, for example! Shirley has used this book to remind us to count our blessings! <br />The 700 pages are divided into 91 (yes, 91!) chapters, plus an epilogue. Approximately the last 40 pages are wonderful black-and-white pictures of the author and her mother. The print size is larger than usual; perhaps this is a conscious choice the author made because of her visual problems. While the book is an autobiography, it's written in the third person, making it seem more like a biography. While I would never doubt the writing talents and skills of Miss Cheng, some of the descriptive narrative did bog me down in a few places. All in all, though, it's a good book. <br />Since early childhood, Shirley Cheng has had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a cripplingand debilitating disease. She's had more pain in her twenty years of life than most people have in a lifetime, but remains a very happy individual. Shirley is the author of two other books. Her plans include surgery to restore her vision and earning multiple degrees from Harvard. <br />The Revelation of a Star's Endless Shine truly lives up to its title.	2005-04-26

Do the ancient writings of Biblical prophesy have any relevance in today's world?  You bet they do!  In The Fullness of Time, J.B. Orly has written about a subject that generations of Biblical scholars have puzzled over and examined.  Mr. Orly's book makes the complexity much more understandable and less mysterious. <br /> <br />The Fullness of Time is subtitled \\"The Truth About What's Coming and - When.\\"  In this highly readable book, Mr. Orly has explained Biblical prophesy to his understanding.  He doesn't try to \\"convert\\" the reader to his way of thinking, but only to offer his opinions on prophesy.   <br /> <br />Often when thinking of Biblical prophesy, we tend to think of the book of Revelation.  Mr. Orly definitely covers Revelation in The Fullness of Time, but he also covers other parts of Biblical prophesy, especially the book of Daniel.  Current events are related to events that were predicted centuries earlier in the Bible.  The Fullness of Time is not written as many books of Biblical prophesy are written; that is, with language that is highly theological and so difficulty to understand that you have to have a dictionary by your side as you sit and study.  Instead, this book is very readable and understandable, and uses modern language. <br /> <br />With 546 pages, The Fullness of Time is definitely a hefty and meaty book.  Don't let the length scare you, however!  Mr. Orly has divided the pages into five volumes;  each volume has several chapter.  Furthermore, the chapters are divided into much smaller sections, many of which are no more than 2 or 3 pages long.  The Fullness of Time would be a wonderful book to use in supplementing a daily Bible study, if only because of the way it's divided.  The author has gone to great lengths in researching the book, as well as in documenting that research.  The chapter notes are very impressive! <br /> <br />If you're even vaguely interested in Biblical prophesy or if you're looking to expand your knowledge base of it, make sure The Fullness of Time is in your reading material! <br /> <br />J.B. Orly, author of The Fullness of Time has a master's degree.  Mr. Orly has held several interesting positions in various businesses, including chairman of a major research foundation, as well a president of a private company.  He has been published in a variety of articles in trade journals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-24

I don't think of people helping to directly provide food to foreign nations by educating the population in ways they can help supply more food for themselves and perhaps for export.  Nurture the Heart, Feed the World has certainly broadened my interpretation of \\"foreign policy.\\" <br /> <br />Nurture the Heart, Feed the World is a delightful autobiography written by Dr. Leon Hesser.  The book tells how he used his background in agricultural economics to increase the production of food on three continents.  In some ways, the book could almost be considered a co-autobiography, if there is such a thing.    Dr. Hesser writes often about his wife, Dr. Florence Hesser.  Starting with their early years, exploring youth, marriage and family, the reader learns about Dr. Leon Hesser's interest in farming, as well as his wife's initial reluctance to live on a farm.  Their various foreign postings made sure that they and their family experienced a wide range of cultures and climates.  Dr. Florence Hesser had a great deal of success as Professor of Education and Director of the Reading Center at The George Washington University.  Her career, like his, has been very interesting and has touched many lives. <br /> <br />The book is filled with so many pictures, I felt like I was having a private showing of a family photo album!   In my opinion, this added significant value to the book.   Many books of this nature have a selection of pictures all together toward the middle.  However, Nurture the Heart, Feed the World spaced pictures throughout the book, so they were in context with the print.  Moreover, nearly all of the pictures had captions underneath. <br /> <br />Born in the Midwest, Leon Hesser earned a Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics from Purdue University.  His subsequent career as a Foreign Service Officer in the Agency for International Development, U.S. Department of State took him and his family to various postings around the globe.  Currently, he and his wife, Dr. Florence Hesser lead a very active retirement life in Naples, Florida.  They give a new meaning to the word \\"busy!\\" <br /> <br />Nurture the Heart, Feed the World is a wonderful story that takes the reader all over the globe. The author and his wife have enthusiastically shared their life histories.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-24

If you want a book that will take you away from your daily worries, this book is for you.  I generally enjoy mysteries, but not those so frightening they prevent me from sleeping.  Anthrax: The Game met my mystery requirements. <br /> <br />People in a New England town suddenly start dying of anthrax.  Employees of several governmental agencies are sent to investigate the source of the poisoning.  There are several subplots to Anthrax: The Game;  one is current and the other is three years prior.  Events three years prior bear a startling resemblance to the current events;  this is yet another subplot.  The reader wonders, and then learns, not only why someone was so intent on killing people, but who it was.  To say much more would be to spoil the story! <br /> <br />This book has more than twenty chapters;  at the very beginning of each chapter, the reader is told the setting of that particular chapter.  Because of the complexity of the subplots in Anthrax: The Game, this information was really nice to have for context purposes.  A glance at the cover lets the reader know that they're going to be reading about a scientific subject.  Ms. Hightower has researched her subject matter well, although I have to hope some of the information in the book can't be true.  Unfortunately, in today's world, it probably is all too accurate. <br /> <br />This book is a riveting mystery, with a lesson we all need to learn from time to time.  Quite simply, that lesson is that when we are in those situations in which we're faced with a problem, we need to step back, think about other parts of our life, do something relaxing to clear our heads, and often the answer comes to light. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-19

If you own or manage a business, your employees should be your biggest asset.  If they're not, it's more than certain that you have a problem.  Dignity and Justice for All is ideal for those beginning their careers in business, and especially for first-time managers.   <br /> <br />I'm always appreciative when a book's subtitle provides valuable insight into it.  The subtitle of Dignity and Justice for All is no exception, because the subtitle is A Blueprint To A Positive Work Environment.  Filled with numerous examples from her years in the business environment, Camille Cances has given some remarkable illustrations, both of what works and, perhaps equally important, what does not work.  I especially enjoyed the chapters entitled \\"The Four C's\\" (which are communication, compromise, control and care) and \\"Becoming the Leaders We Want to Be.\\"  The traits Ms. Cances lists as valuable for leaders (honesty, vision based, goal oriented, knowledgeable, asking for help, being fair, self-confident, creative, handling change, self-motivation, and follow through) are certainly benchmarks for everyone, whether or not they work in the business climate. <br /> <br />Having worked in the business world for a number of years, I would have benefited greatly from this book early in my career.  However, now is better late than never!  The chapters were short, and further divided into smaller sections, making this a good book to read on the run.  There were several typographical errors in the book that detracted from the content. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-19

This book surely must be based, at least in part, on some observations from East Tennessee Christian Home in Elizabethton, Tennessee because the author has cited several times East Tennessee Children's Home (where the novel is set), as well as Allen Avenue (the actual location of The Home), and Elizabethton, Tennessee (the city in which the novel is set).

When I first viewed the picture on the cover of the book and glanced at the subtitle, I thought, \\"What on earth would this book have to do with leadership?\\"  The answer is an unqualified, \\"Absolutely plenty!\\"  The cover picture shows several men who appear to be playing some type of a game on snow and ice.  The complete subtitle is \\"Leadership Lessons from the Great Antarctic Explorer.\\"  The authors of Shackleton's Way, Margot Morrell and Stephanie Capparell,  skillfully combine a sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat story with legendary lessons on leadership. <br /> <br />Very briefly, Shackleton's Way is the story of Sir Ernest Shackleton and the 27 men stranded with him in the Antarctic for almost two years in the early days of the 1900's.   Everyone survived, but probably only because of Shackleton's outstanding leadership abilities and practices.    Margot Morrell and Stephanie Capparell, skillfully weave lessons on leadership throughout the pages of the adventure-filled book.  <br /> <br />The thorough research from various diaries, letters, books and other documents is evident on every page of the book.   The authors certainly did their homework! Each chapter tells of a portion of the trip, while illustrating the leadership lessons Sir Ernest utilized in maintaining hope, working with diverse folks in an often-adverse environment, working as a team, creativity in problem solving and many other traits a good leader uses.   Near the end of each chapter, bullet points clearly and succinctly illustrate pertinent points in that chapter.  Finally, each chapter ends with a section called \\"Working It In,\\" in which contemporary leaders demonstrate how Sir Ernest Shackleton's leadership lessons were of value to them. <br /> <br />Not only will you find the lessons in Shackleton's Way useful with co-workers and employees, but you'll also find them helpful with your family.  Even though these principles and lessons about leadership were illustrated nearly a century ago, they are timeless;  if anything, they are more valuable now than at that time.  Sir Ernest Shackleton was a servant leader;  we would all do well to learn leadership lessons from Shackleton's Way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-01

Parents often need stories to tell their children, whether bedtime stories or stories more of the life-lesson type.  Frequently, those in leadership or management positions need examples to introduce a talk of some sort, whether in a formal or informal situation.   How I Found Trouble and Trouble Found Me by Johnson City, Tennessee author Jeffrey Shapiro tells approximately 40 stories from his own life.  Just about all of the stories can find their way into a parental, management or leadership example at some point. <br /> <br />The stories in How I Found Trouble and Trouble Found Me  run a full range of emotions.  Some of the stories had me crying and some of them had me laughing, and some had me crying from laughing. The latter are my favorite!  Mr. Shapiro writes in a very conversational tone;  I felt like he was personally telling me each story. <br /> <br />How I Found Trouble and Trouble Found Me is divided into eight sections. The 219 pages absolutely run by faster than a car on a race track. Some of the stories are just a couple of pages long, but more are a little longer.  I particularly enjoyed the stories in the section, \\"A Boy and His Toys\\" and \\"The Consummate Professional.\\"  My favorite story?  \\"Long Ride Home\\" in the section entitled \\"Maladies of Old Age.\\"  It could be made into a movie! <br /> <br />This book is a wonderful gift idea for all sorts of occasions.  It's also a great book for what I term \\"plane books.\\"  These are books I love to read when traveling or waiting for an appointment, because they're so interesting I can block everything else completely out.

For the maximum impact from the book, do the exercises she suggests at the end;  they'll help to gel what you glean from the pages.   <br /> <br />Joy of Leadership is a short and quick read.

I wanted to introduce myself to her philosophy of volunteerism prior to the meeting.  Since then, I've re-read the book several times, and each time I get more and more out of it.  The writing is fresh but timeless, new and invigorating.  It's  book that's so good you can tune everything else out when you're reading it.  &quot;To Lead is To Serve&quot; is also a quick, easy read - you can read it in just a couple of hours.<br />The principles that Ms. McBee espouses in &quot;To Lead is To Serve&quot; can absolutely turn an organization - any organization, be it for-profit or a non-profit, around.  Unlike many who write about non-profits, the author skillfully differentiates between management and leadership.  The heart of the book is the recruitment and retention of volunteers.  Membership-based organzations will find great benefit in using Ms. McBee's ideas to not only recruit members, but to also retain those members.  Drawing upon her extensive background as both an employee of and volunteer for non-profits, the author sparks different, exciting and creative ideas for serving others.  Truly, to lead is to serve.  This book tells how; a real bonus is that many of the ideas can be implemented immediatly and individually.  Whatever your position in a for-profit or a non-profit, I enthusiastically recommend that you read this book and then apply its life-changing and organization-changing principles and ideas.	2003-06-24
