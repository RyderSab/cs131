They may defoliate hundreds or thousands of acres, but they are the dietary staple of many mammals &amp; birds. Some caterpillars ingest fallen leaves, thereby hastening decomposition &amp; soil formation. This guide will enable forest managers, entomologists, &amp; nonspecialists to identify many of the eastern region's most frequently encountered species. Chapters: life cycle; morphology; collecting caterpillars &amp; eggs; verifying identification; rearing caterpillars; preserving specimens; photographing caterpillars; species descriptions. Glossary.

The Text appears largely as it was written while the war was still in progress; it has been reviewed for declassification &amp; cleared for release. In the preface, Poole discusses the few revisions that were made &amp; the rationale for leaving the text substantially unaltered. For 1969-1970, it is important to convey the attitudes of senior policymakers without benefit of hindsight. The Nixon administration did not yet look upon South Vietnam as a lost cause. While the JCS had reservations &amp; made them known, the overall tone of their appraisals of the war was one of guarded optimism. A full test of Vietnamization was yet to come. Illus	2004-07-18

US	49339747	R3FLSWM6JN3RTW	0701138378	791690804	Zinky Boys	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Afghanistan War	Svetlana Aleksievich is a prominant Belorussian feminist writer. Her best-known work is \\"War's Unwomanly Face\\", a collection of interviews with rank-and-file women soldiers of World War ll. Despite her personal anti-war sentiment radiating from every page, the author's treatment of the veterans is sympathetic and respectful. After all, they sacrificed their youth in the Great Patriotic War. That titanic struggle is commemorated every year, its soldiers honored as heroes of their Motherland. Not so the Afghanistan War and its veterans. Not unlike American Vietnam vets, afgantsi were damned and forgotten by their homeland. \\"Zinky Boys\\" takes its name from the zinc coffins which transported Soviet remains from Afghanistan. The USSR did not learn much from the American experience in Vietnam, but one lesson they did realize early was public reaction to planeloads of returning coffins. \\"Zinkies\\" were delivered to families at night, in a government attempt to conceal information about numbers and types of casualties. Like her previous work, this book is a collection of interviews from the author's distinctly pacifist viewpoint. Fully half of her contributors are women. Most are grieving mothers, sisters, sweethearts, and wives of soldiers. These did, and still do, comprise Russia's largest and most influential feminist movement. Their stories are absolutely heartbreaking. Other correspondents include female medical personnel who treated wounded. Theirs are harrowing stories of the mutilations committed by mujahedin (\\"holy warriors\\"), whose favored attrocities were dismemberments and castrations. Some victims were tournicated and left alive to be rescued by their comrades. They often begged their surgeons not to save them. The sealed coffins of those who died of dismemberment were horribly lightweight on the shoulders of their pallbearers back home. Cynically, the military learned to weight such coffins with dirt to prevent questions from bereaved relatives. The final groupof female contributors are \\"civilian workers\\", most often a euphemism for prostitutes, who went to Afghanistan for their \\"international duty\\". These correspondents speak of the emotional burden of officers and young conscripts. The majority of the men interviewed by Aleksievich are suffering from physical ailments, Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, nightmares, alcoholism, and other maladies which also affected their \\"vietnamtsi\\" counterparts. These men fought a largely unsupported war against an enemy who spurned conventional tactics. They witnessed violent death and unspeakable torture of their comrades. Often they were forced to slaughter innocent Afghan civilians used by mujahedin as human-shields for their strike-and-run operations. Aleksievich has little compassion for Afghanistan vets. Like a Soviet equivalent of Jane Fonda, she accuses them of being murderers and baby-killers. She simplistically lauds the mujahedin for \\"defending their country\\", perhaps ignorant of the fact that they were mostly foreign jihadists recruited, funded, supplied, and trained by the USA to fight a proxy war with the USSR. Not surprisingly, Aleksievich was hailed by the Soviet anti-war movement while hated by the government and veterans. It is ironic that her book mimics the Soviet press by publishing only a single POV. She does give a sound-off platform to one offended and anonymous afganetz, but presents him as a disturbed psycho. Vietnam vets would probably identify. This is not the best book about the USSR's disasterous, decade-long conflict.(...)Despite its shortcomings, it succeeds brilliantly in its own category: a feminist treatise against war and a voice for those whose lives were destroyed by it.	2004-07-16

After its publication a great number of major events took place. To mention only a few: both the UNIDROIT and the Lando Commission published their Principles; Markesinis published a book on the gradual convergence of common law and civil law in Europe, Kötz and Von Bar published the first book on European Contract Law, and European Tort Law, respectively; the Trento Project on The Common Core of Private Law in Europe was commenced by Mattei and Bussani; and an international conference was held in The Hague under the very title Towards a European Civil Code . These events, and indeed many others, convinced us that the idea of a commonly held civil code for Europe is not as bold as it might have seemed when we started preparations for the first edition of this book in 1991. European private law has become an established field of research in which many eminent scholars from all over Europe are involved. Courses on European private law are taught at several European universities. All these events - and the commercial success of the first edition - call for this second edition, which differs from the first in several respects. First, we have added several new subjects, which have increased the number of chapters from 23 to 36. Secondly, we no longer asked the contributors to discuss the feasibility of a European civil code - except for a few chapters which deal with completely new topics - but instead to directly address the possible content of common rules. Thirdly, we are glad to welcome some new authors for some of the subjects already included in the first edition. Finally, all chapters have been updated.<br />Table of Contents<br />Preface.

Based on the experience of the IMF Legal Department in assisting many developing and transition countries to draft tax legislation, it comprises contributions by tax experts from around the world. <br />This useful guide aims to identify the legal issues that arise in the drafting of tax laws and to examine the various solutions which have been devised in national legislation. A comparative tax law bibliography and a bibliography of the national tax laws of IMF member countries are included in appendix. <br />Its practical nature and the general scope of its discussion will make it a valuable tool not only for officials in developing and transition countries and their advisors, but also for students, academics and practitioners with an interest in comparative tax law. <br />Table of Contents<br />Preface.

Then a new movement -- mystical, militaristic, &amp; virulently anti-Christian -- began to spread like wildfire among the Chinese peasants. The foreigners nicknamed them &quot;the Boxers&quot; -- a snickering reference to their martial-arts routines -- never imagining that the group would soon terrorize the world. Based on diaries, letters, memoirs, &amp; extensive research, this is &quot;a fast-paced &amp; exciting narrative that skillfully captures the human interest, folly, irony, &amp; tragedy of this historic upheaval.&quot; B&amp;W photos	2004-07-14

In this new edition, the author analyzes the law of secured credit under federal bankruptcy law. He presents an exhaustive and authoritative analysis of secured claims in bankruptcy since even secured creditors cannot rely passively on their relatively privileged status but must avoid potential pitfalls to recovery and actively pursue all available assets of the debtor.<br />Virtually all of the material is new to this revision since secured creditors were largely immune from bankruptcy administration prior to 1978. Secured interests are now enforced in bankruptcy proceedings far more than anywhere else. Moreover, bankruptcy law does not adhere to a distinction between real and personal property.<br />In Part I the authors cover the avoidance powers of a bankruptcy trustee against security interests otherwise good under state law. Among the topics covered are voidable preferences, commingled bank accounts, lapsed perfection, and exempt property. Part II begins the discussion of the administrative treatment of a secured claim once it is established as valid in bankruptcy. Topics included are liquidation and reorganization, reinstatement and cure, special status of airplanes, redemption and affirmation, automatic stay, proofs of claim, adequate protection and cash collateral. Part III concludes with analysis of after-acquired property and proceeds, proceeds and voidable preferences, power of sale, surcharge, post petition secured credit, &quot;double elevens,&quot; classification veto, equity cushions, post petition interest rates, and fees, costs, and charges.<br />Gilmore and Carlson on Secured Lending: Claims in Bankruptcy will enable practitioners to serve the interests of their creditor clients more effectively by recovering the maximum amount possible from any bankruptcy proceeding.	2004-07-09

The Russian aspect of these recollections, with their unfamiliar allusions (partly explained in the footnotes), does not hide a similar sense of disillusionment and suffering. Alexievich uses first-person accounts to illustrate the style of conflict the Soviet soldier faced, as well as to reveal the enormity of the betrayal of the ordinary Soviet citizen that may have contributed to the end of the U.S.S.R.

Roetzel's &quot;Gentleman&quot; is about creating a classic, elegant life style. Following Mr. Retzel's philosophy, style is not something we do for others. The pursuit of style is for one's own personal satisfaction. Therefore, Mr. Roetzel focuses on an understated, conservative elegance, with an acknowledgment of the importance of details, even if no one else notices. Roetzel's book focuses on mens fashion, with a bias toward tailored English clothing, but he goes beyond business clothing, to address casual, sport, and home style. In addition to the obligatory chapters on suits, shoes, and casual dress, there are sections on grooming and fragrance, hairstyles, wristwatches, and how to enjoy an elegant, relaxing breakfast at home. This book is a treatise on gracious living, and he introduces his readers to many of the small luxuries which no one should miss out on: the experience of a traditional shave from a good English barber; a pair of shell cordovan shoes; a bespoke suit; a comfortable and beautiful dressing robe. His philosophy is best exemplified by the section on eating breakfast, where he exhorts one to begin the day with a leisurely elegant ritual including &quot;perfectly toasted bread.&quot; Personally, I barely ever eat breakfast, but the call to slow down and take the time to enjoy life's small pleasures resounds loudly none the less. The book is not perfect, and Mr. Roetzel has some rather quaint and outdated ideas - Overall, however, the book is an excellent roadmap for those who wish to live a cut above the norm in this too-fast, hyper-casual, overly-efficient, mass-produced, machine-made, often-shoddy world	2004-07-04
