When they died on safari in Africa he apprenticed himself to a shaman. As a young man Kitaj had a torrid love affair with a witch-woman high in the African mountains of Ruwenzori, which resulted in a son and a murder.<br /><br />Kitaj spends the next period of his life becoming the richest man in the world, then throws most of it away in a study of spiritual things, letting go of his worldly cares and answering the suppressed calling he has felt since he was a child. This finally leads to his spectacular transformation - disappearing into thin air- in Venice in 1992, with the promise that he will return in 1999, a new Messiah for a new millennium.<br /><br />The narrator spends an incredible amount of time describing Kitaj's spiritual experiences and inner journeys to enlightenment. It got to be a bit much at times, I had to force myself to read through the middle hundred or so pages of the book, and thought if I saw the phrases \\"mythreality\\" or \\"newconsciousness\\" much more, I would scream. There is disappointingly little meat to these descriptions either; hints are dropped about telekinetic powers or UFOs from Sirius which are never explained.<br /><br />The narrator himself quotes a journalist's assessment of the messiah Kitaj, which states that anything written about the man tells more about the writer than the subject. This is indeed the case with this book, it is more John Hall's history and inner life than Kitaj's. I don't know if this is an unintended irony, or a brilliant bit of writing.<br /><br />If you like a story with an unreliable (possibly crazy) narrator, read the chilling WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN by Lionel Shriver.	2005-09-28

(And no - it doesn't get any more cheerful.) The story of the two telepaths' too-perfect married life is told in a series of flashbacks interspaced with chapters of Jeremy's grief-stricken downward spiral, and a strange, omniscient voice who is observing their perfect love.<br /><br />The series of ever more bizarre and violent events that befall Bremen as he slowly kills himself are reminiscent of Dante. The flashbacks are as much occupied with the mathematics of Jeremy's work as his life with Gail. (You can tell without looking at the copyright that this book was published in 1991-1992, because chaos theory was the big fad in mathematics then.) Although a lot of time is spent describing Gail, it never feels like she's a fully-realized person of her own - she's just \\"the wife\\", a shallow reflection of the protagonist's (or author's) desired mate.<br /><br />If you like this book, I bet you'll like REFLEX and JUMPER by Steven Gould.	2005-09-16

The narrator of this tale is Daedalus, the Greek inventor famous for the creation of human wings - in the legend his son Icarus perished while misusing them.<br /><br />In Saberhagen's version, Daedalus has recently had a misunderstanding with the King of Athens, so flees to the court of King Minos of Crete. He has been working for the king for a short time when a white bull, subject of an old prophecy, comes out of the sea onto the shores of Heraklios.<br /><br />This is an unusual bull - he walks on two legs, can speak, and is accompanied by a metallic companion. It is quickly apparent to the reader (but incomprehensible to the narrator) that the bull and his strange companions are visitors from outer space. At the bull's request, Daedalus builds a labyrinth where the bull sets up a school - which is destroyed by the brutish Athenian prince Theseus.<br /><br />The bull's school is a clever parody of the ridiculous aspects of the university system; the book itself is divided into sections named after the various stages of study at university. An entertaining read even if this subtlety is lost on you, a good yarn about alien invaders in Greek times.	2005-09-15

After his father's death, Rafe stays at home for a couple of years and attends junior college to appease his clingy mother before going off to university. There he meets his bizarre roommate, J.D. Flood, aka Damon, the dissolute scion of a wealthy Grosse Pointe family.<br /><br />Damon leads Raphael into debauchery with an older woman, the end result being that a drunken Rafe crashes his car into an oncoming train. As a result of the wreck the former football hero loses his left leg and is emasculated. All this happens in the first couple of chapters. The rest of the book is taken up with Rafe's recovery and rehabilitation, full of frequent rants about social services and their corrupting programs. Rafe is settling into his new life, mainly watching the antics of his poor neighbors, whom he christens \\"The Losers\\" when Damon comes breezing back into his life again.<br /><br />I kept waiting for something to happen, but the whole plot (such as it is) is not revealed until the last chapter, as a reminiscence after one of the main characters is dead.

Sidney was born in into an important British family during momentous times, two of his godparents were Philip I of Spain (for whom he was named) and \\"Bloody\\" Mary Tudor, and he was the nephew of Robert Dudley, love of Elizabeth I's life. Sidney is well known in academic circles for his writings and poetry, but like most people, I had never heard of him before reading this novel. I looked him up on the Internet and was surprised by the amount of material about his writings and his life.<br /><br />At this time Poland is without a king (Henri of France deserted the throne) and the powerful lords are vying with one another for control. The Poland Philip encounters is a hotbed of social conflicts: Catholics and Protestants, new medical and scientific colleges and occult studies that are anathema in England or France, and always the threat of invasion by the nearby Turks.<br /><br />Young Philip is ostensibly in Krakow for his other godfather Antony's wedding, but he is secretly carrying a message from Queen Elizabeth to the exiled Catholic priest and professor Caspar Laurence. Sidney is attacked several times by someone presumably looking for the message.<br /><br />While waiting for the priest to return to the college so that he may deliver his message, Philip spends time with Antony's new sisters-in-law, Yolanta and Maria, who are close to his own age. He grows to know and care for the girls deeply, orphans who are being raised by their uncle Pan Jan Zamoyski, the most powerful lord in Krakow.<br /><br />When the sisters take Philip to see the local sights, disaster strikes. They visit a spring called the Ancient Mass, which has been considered a holy site for millennia. When Philip bends to drink the water, something bizarre happens to him, and when he comes back to his senses a couple of minutes later, the girls have both disappeared.<br /><br />A vast search is instigated, but there is no sign of the girls, and no clues as to what happened to them. The tensions already simmering in Krakow boil over - directed at the prime suspect - Philip. He finally manages to make it back to the spring some days later to conduct his own investigation and finds an insensible Maria lying next to the spring. There is still no sign of her sister Yolanta.<br /><br />Philip delays his return to England despite Queen Elizabeth's and his family's urgings, determined to get to the bottom of the mystery of Yolanta's disappearance. However, Maria never remembers anything more than a sensation of falling into light and Yolanta is never seen again. A dejected Sidney finally returns home to his queen's service.minutes later, the girls have both disappeared.  <br /> <br />A vast search is instigated, but there is no sign of the girls, and no clues as to what happened to them.

After one month, if Satan decides to stay mortal, he may be eligible for re-admittance to heaven under the normal rules.<br /><br />Glen Duncan's brilliant writing shows Satan as Legion, indeed, forever getting lost in digressions and asides, altering his own story to fit circumstances, lying to the reader, himself, and anyone else who will listen. It's like Satan as played by Eddie Izzard.

In this \\"Other Side of the Story\\" of the Bible, God, Lucifer, the angels, cherubim and seraphim are all incorporeal beings from another universe, who come to Earth's universe when their space-time collapses. Got that so far? Ok, so these beings are the combined spirits of their former races, God in particular is the combination of spirits of three species, thus his trinity. They like Earth's potential, but are dissatisfied with its inhabitants and cause a cataclysm to destroy the dinosaurs, thus allowing the rise of the mammals. They manipulate the evolution of man, discarding one imperfect model after another, until they come up with a version that will best serve their purposes. And what is this purpose? Well, apparently God and the heavenly host are some sort of galactic vampires who live off the psychic energy of their charges. The more fearful and frantic the prayers, the more psychic energy expended, and therefore all the more satisfying the savor for the heavenly hosts. Especially savory are righteous bloodbaths and crazy violence - more psychic energy than fearful prayers.<br /><br />So Lucifer, aka Satan, is against using people as sheep, and rebels against God to save man. He has been trying to help man all along, and shows how through the retold stories of Cain, Abel, Seth, Moses, Lazarus and Jesus. (I kept hoping he would cover the story of Job) Satan and his cronies discover a way to use tachyons to bend time and receive nourishing energy from their former universe - knowledge he shares with God. God scornfully replies something along the lines of \\"Why, when I've got it so good here?\\" After the age of miracles, God and the heavenly host depart to four other planets to raise creatures who will be the perfect sheep without that pesky free will. The coming Armageddon will be when the other creatures come to Earth to kill off mankind in a cataclysmic bloodbath (very savory).<br /><br />While an interesting concept, this book is hard to take seriously, especially as it lapses back and forth between biblical phrasing and modern prose. The science-fictiony aspects are not that well done, either. I would venture to guess that the author is an ex-Catholic.  Protestantism simply does not engender this level of hatred.

Can Morgan, the half-Deryni Duke of  Corwyn, prepare his young ward to defend himself against Charissa in time?<br /><br />What are Deryni? They are never formally explained, but Deryni are magical people, not technically human, who can evidently breed with humans, because there are numerous half-Deryni characters in this novel.<br /><br />The Church, which I assume to be the Catholic Church of Rome in the 1100s, hates the Deryni and wants to stamp out their magic and influence in England. (I also assume that this is set in England - an alternate history - because Gywnedd is the name of Wales in this time period.)<br /><br />I had a friend in junior high school who was a devoted Deryni fan and urged me repeatedly to read this series. I wish I had, because now that I'm older and more skeptical, I was less than captivated by this book - which I'm sure I would have been when I was younger. This is truly a teenager's book, because all the characters are so black-and-white; either all good or all bad. The plot seemed slow, but mainly because the POV shifted between multiple characters and sub-plots. I wish it had been written from the POV of young prince Kelson, and his angst and personality explored more in depth; i.e. - a typical hero quest novel. I felt as if I did not know Kelson, whereas a book with a similarly slow plot, DRAGONSONG by Anne McCaffrey, haunts me to this day because of the deep character development of the heroine Menolly.<br /><br />For a good hero quest series, you can't go wrong with David Edding's BELGARIAD.ero quest series, you can't go wrong with David Edding's BELGARIAD.	2005-06-30

In this compulsively readable book, he presents the religious and social origins of food taboos - many of which have been carried forward to modern societies all over the planet. I found his insights into the derivations of many popular words and phrases to be fascinating. However, his irreverent attitude may be seen as heretical by people of various religions, Christianity being the main focus of his humorous finger-pointing. If you are not thin-skinned about hearing less-than-angelic things about your religion's history, I think you will find this book fascinating.	2005-06-24

Here, Sydney meets the formidable Anna Espinosa, who will become her major rival during the first season of the television show. Sydney's cover is blown, so she must outsmart the malicious and sneaky Anna to successfully finish her mission.<br /><br />A good entry in the Alias series, I would rank it as a tie for the second best story line of these books.

(I assume the tale is set in Chile, but the country is never specifically named.) Esteban, the impoverished scion of the Trueba family, makes his fortune in mining in the late 1800s so he can marry Rosa, the beautiful daughter of the del Valle family. Rosa dies unexpectedly and Esteban ends up marrying her clairvoyant younger sister, Clara, who always keeps the house alive with her spirits and s&eacute;ances. The story follows the lives of their children (Blanca, Jaime and Nicolas) and their granddaughter Alba through prosperity, poverty, death, birth, revolution, war and exile.<br /><br />Esteban says at one point in the story that the Marxists will never rule the country because they are cold and calculating, and do not acknowledge the magic and spirits of the Latin American culture. Allende calls forth spirits in these pages and makes the reader believe in green-haired mermaid girls, clairvoyant grandmothers and revolutionary lovers.	2005-06-16

He is warned to be wary of the wizard, and soon notices that the situation is far from normal at Glynrenden's home in the woods. Most strange of all is the mage's disturbing and bewitching wife, Lilith, who watches everything impassively with her luminous green eyes.<br /><br />Aubrey learns lessons of love and hate, right and wrong, on top of the art of shape-changing during his time as Glynrenden's apprentice. A deftly woven tale, reminiscent of the fairy tales I loved as a child, full of nature and morals. Of course, the reader figures out the truth about Lilith long before Aubrey, but this did nothing to detract from my enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />I am in love with Sharon Shinn's writing, but this book is not for you if you like a story with more action and whiz-bang.	2005-06-16

To his amazement, he wakes up in his eighteen-year-old body in his college dorm. It is 1963 again, and Jeff is young and full of memories of the events of the next 25 years, like who won the World Series. Jeff lives a very different life the second time around, financially secure and health-conscious. However, he dies at 43 again.<br /><br />And Again. And Again.<br /><br />In one of his many \\"replays\\" Jeff meets Pamela Phillips, who is also repeating the years between 1963 and 1988 multiple times. Together they find love and try to change the future world they remember. Jeff and Pamela's journey to enlightenment reminds us of the joy in simple things and the beauty of life.<br /><br />The concept is fascinating, but the writing seems alternately stilted or excessively descriptive of mechanical processes which do not enlighten us about the characters, merely their movements. Jeff's ambitions seem like puerile misogynist male fantasies at times, but the book kept me turning pages to find out what ultimately happens to him.<br /><br />If you love the Jeff character, I think you will like JUMPER and REFLEX by Steven Gould, the adventures of a young man who discovers that he is telekinetic and what he does with this ability.	2005-06-15

Noah Hicks, Sydney's hunky on-again, off-again boyfriend is also on the mission, and the two of them get to spend a little time alone.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the best book of the Alias series. There is more fast-paced action and mission interactions between Sydney and Sloan, like an episode of the TV show. The mysterious Rimbaldi is also implicated in the works of art being stolen.	2005-06-13

In this future world, people with ESP are employed in all professional levels of the job market. It is impossible to get away with murder when all the cops, doctors, lawyers, etc can read a person's intentions and stop him before he can fully think about, much less commit, such a deed. Nevertheless, Reich does commit the murder, and most of the book is taken up with his attempted flight from the clutches of Esper Police Prefect Lincoln Powell.<br /><br />I know, I know, this book is supposed to be a classic, but I thought it was a real stinker. It reads like a smarmy 50s cops-and-robbers story, which is essentially what it is - only set in the future with telepaths. Don't get me started on the character development! All the female characters are either a) breast-heaving, snuggle-kittens or b) crazy death crones. Just awful.	2005-06-10

Did you ever wake up one morning and wonder: What happened to the endless summer afternoon of my childhood? How did I end up here in suburbia, paying a mortgage and watching endless repeats of Thomas the Tank videos? This is what seems to have happened to the characters in this darkly comic novel.<br /><br />Sarah, a feminist bi-sexual in college, marries an older man for financial security and finds herself stuck in the endless hell of playground snack-time with a demanding three-year-old. Todd, the handsome former frat boy, slipped easily enough through college and law school, but now cannot pass the bar exam. These two seem somehow personally offended that real life should encroach on their lives, and in a last ditch effort to avoid adult responsibility, they begin a love affair. (Perrotta does an excellent job of using their affair to allude to the story of MADAME BOVARY, the book that is read in Sarah's book club.)<br /><br />Thrown in the mix is Larry, the angry former cop; Mary Ann, the uptight Martha Stewart clone; and Ronnie, the recently paroled pedophile whose presence brings the simmering summer heat to a fiery explosion. An excellent read whose pages are as easily and quickly consumed as the cute little goldfish crackers pictured on the front cover.	2005-06-08

She agrees to one last mission, ferrying a group of rich members of The Contact Society out to chase a mysterious signal that was picked up four years ago around a neutron star. To everyone's surprise, the signal leads to a series of discoveries of long-dead alien cultures and an unknown group who is monitoring them. The rules in McDevitt's universe are vastly different from what we are used to in other sci-fi tales; the amateur SETI hunters run around trampling and poking ruins, cutting through hatches, and instigating first contact with alien races, all without waiting for official back-up. McDevitt delivers plenty of action, danger and sweeping interstellar vistas, but little is ever learned about the ETs.<br /><br />So why did I give it such a low rating? I kept thinking of the crew as \\"Gilligan's Island in Space\\"; there is the millionaire, the professor, the movie star, the funeral director, the artist, etc. A lot more character development, and much more diligent editing would have been in order (In one especially memorable scene, a character who died a gruesome death a couple of planets ago takes part in the conversation.) The POV shifts incessantly in the latter half of the novel, seemingly in an ill-advised attempt to fill out the characters. McDevitt uses the acceptable method of POV hand-off, but it still gets old really quickly. If you prefer action sequences, as I believe most sci-fi readers do, perhaps the razzle-dazzle will make up for these faults. But personally, I would have preferred more about the archaeology and the origins and motives of the aliens.<br /><br />If you like tales of interstellar archaeology, try THE SHIP WHO SEARCHED by Anne McCaffrey.	2005-06-06

Joan persuades her older brother to secretly teach her to read, starting a life-long love of scholarship. When the opportunity presents itself, Joan hides as a male to further her education, even forsaking the knight Gerold, the red-headed love of her life. Joan's tale, in keeping with the legend, can only end badly. A few of the plot elements stretch credulity, but overall this is a good read with bright, vibrant characters. I always love a tale where an oppressed woman breaks away from the system and realizes her full potential.	2005-06-03

When the mother dies in a car accident, the girl spends the next 30 years shutting down all emotions and merely existing. When she is struck by lightning, her perspective is slowly changed by a steamy (literally) affair with Lazarus Jones - a handsome young man who was revived after 40 minutes of being clinically dead from a lightning strike. She becomes suspicious when Lazarus, like a character from one of the fairy tales she loves, will only make love in the dark.<br /><br />I love Alice Hoffman's work, but I am of two minds about this book. Perhaps I'm left with this feeling of diffidence because I read most of this book on a plane, but I don't think that is quite it. The interlacing of fairy tales into the story was deft and lovely. I can only come to the conclusion that the choice of first person narration is what makes this book hard to love; because what can you expect but a cold narration from a self-proclaimed ice queen? I think I would have liked this book much better had it been written in third person.	2005-06-01

There is only one problem... Rose is a boy, whose adoptive father and mother raise as a girl for their own bizarre reasons. However strange this may sound, Rose is probably the most normal member of this family of psychopaths, cross-dressers and child molesters. This sounds like an exciting, titillating novel, but it is not. At one point Rose (the narrator) even tells us if we want that kind of book we should seek elsewhere. To be perfectly blunt, what other reason is there to read a book about confused gender identity than voyeurism and titillation?<br /><br />Some books make you wish there was more of it. For MISFORTUNE, I kept hoping fervently for less. In my opinion, the plot does not progress until Rose finally runs away from her deranged family, at age 17 and approximately page 300. And the oh-so-perfect and improbable ending which neatly ties all the loose ends into a bow... Well, I'm sure it was meant to emulate the improbable endings of the Greek myths mentioned liberally throughout the book (That's another thing - if you're not familiar with Greek myths you may soon be lost), but all I could think was \\"Puh-leeze!\\".  For a much better read about a boy raised as a girl try Jeffrey Eugenides fabulous MIDDLESEX: A NOVEL.	2005-05-31

The story covers Diego's tutelage in Indian mysticism, swordplay, acrobatics, magic and gambling as a child and young man.

Buck's trilogy about the family of Wang Lung, the protagonist of THE GOOD EARTH. This book finds his grandson, Wang Yuan, son of the warlord Wang the Tiger, graduating from the war college at the beginning of the first Chinese Cultural Revolution. Yuan, a serious, thoughtful, but willful boy does not want to follow in his father's footsteps, but instead feels an affinity with the earth and growing things as his grandfather Wang Lung did.<br /><br />Yuan defies his father and runs away to live in his grandfather's old mud farmhouse. This begins a chain of events which take Yuan across the world. He ends up in the coastal city where his half-sister and her mother live, as well as his uncle, Wang the Landlord, along with his spoiled family. Yuan gets exposed to, but never really embraces, the westernized party lifestyle of his half-sister and the revolutionary activities of his cousins Sheng and Meng.<br /><br />After Yuan is arrested as a revolutionary, his family ransoms him and sends him to study in America, where he spends six years attaining an advanced degree in horticulture. Being a foreigner in a strange land causes Yuan to examine all his feelings, beliefs and prejudices. He is doubly introspective when he returns to China and sees his country anew through foreign eyes. Yuan is caught in a trap by his education, neither belonging wholly to either the old China or the new, his heart as divided as his family - half live in the modern coastal city and half live back in the country.<br /><br />I thought this was the best of the trilogy because Yuan's introspection makes him the most well-developed and conflicted character in this multi-generational tale. However, Buck's plodding, biblical style is not for everyone and I will admit that every page seemed like as two or three (or more!) It took me several weeks to complete this novel.	2005-05-27

In the aftermath of thermonuclear war, he becomes the leader to rally his family and neighbors to survive in the desperate situation.<br /><br />I'm afraid I can't say much to recommend this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting, with persons of color and women portrayed as the barest of stereotypes. Far too much time is spent in the beginning of the book describing the chess-like moves of the USA and Soviets that lead up to the war. This book is probably typical of the mentality of the 50s, but seems extremely dated to a modern reader.

Hoffman's natural (and supernatural) descriptions are not the spice that livens the story as they have in her previous works.

IMPERIAL WOMAN is the fictionalized biography of the great Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, the real power behind the throne during the reins of the last four emperors of China. The story starts with her as a beautiful Manchu teenager who, along with her cousin Sakota, is picked for the emperor's crop of concubines. Through guile and ambition, Tzu Hsi bears the male heir to the emperor she comes to control. When the emperor dies young, Tzu Hsi makes sure she and Sakota are named regents for the young child emperor.<br /><br />Through keen intelligence, intrigue, and whatever other means necessary, Tzu Hsi holds the imperial throne through her son's childhood. Buck portrays a woman split between feelings of love for her family and what is the best for the empire, rather than what I gather is the historical feeling - that Tzu Hsi was some sort of evil spider spinning schemes from the center of her web in Forbidden City. Through all the machinations and years she is aided by Jung Lu, her former betrothed and the love of her life.<br /><br />The Dowager Empress has the ultimate power, but Buck shows she is a servant of the opinions of her court advisors and in reality only rules the eunuchs and court ladies in the Forbidden City. She is a relic of the past in a time of great change and cultural upheaval in China, when it is besieged by western nations and ideas. The infamous Boxer Rebellion is the beginning of the end for Tzu Hsi, and she loses her spirit and resolve after this defeat and the death of her beloved Jung Lu.	2005-05-12

SONS is the sequel to the famous (and thanks to Oprah - newly popular) THE GOOD EARTH. The story begins just where the previous book left off, with Wang Lung a dying old man, hoping his sons will handle his legacy wisely. Of course, they do not.<br /><br />The oldest son, Wang The Landlord, turns into fat, greedy man who sells off much of the land to pursue hedonistic pleasures. Wang the Merchant, the second son, sticks more to the letter of his father's wishes, but is an opportunistic skinflint who loves silver above all else. These two think always of their position in society and how to advance it, and care more about how they appear in others' eyes than the actual substance of their lives. Their children are spoiled and worthless, just as Wang Lung saw the old lord Hwang's sons become in THE GOOD EARTH. The reader gets the feeling Wang Lung would be disgusted.<br /><br />The majority of the novel follows the wild, rebellious third son, who becomes known as Wang the Tiger. He ran away from home as a teenager to be a soldier, and this book finds him a young man planning to escape his master and establish his own dynasty in the north. With his trusted companions, Wang the Tiger fights his way to becoming the controlling warlord of a region in the north, and he finally falls in love with a fierce robber girl. (These scenes painted vivid pictures in my mind reminiscent of the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.) Much to his bewilderment, the years go by and his life does not work out as he plans. He ends up with a son he does not understand, just as his father did not understand him.<br /><br />Pearl S. Buck's plodding, biblical phrasing is not so easy for the modern reader, and I confess that while it was a good story, every page seemed like two or three, and I found myself groaning aloud \\"Isn't it over YET?\\"	2005-05-09

Both men became masters of genetic engineering, Martin specializing in plants, and his nephew Heinrich in animal life forms.<br /><br />Martin designs and freely distributes his proud creation to save the human race, tree houses. These houses are literally trees, genetically modified to have rooms, beds, chairs, cupboards that grow food, and of course, composting toilets. A tiny problem develops when the first version of the house eats its occupants. Oops. Heinrich's big creations are LDUs, sentient worker beasts that look like walking tables with eight eyes; fauns, cute little half girls-half goats who educate and care for human young; and TRACs, large sentient creatures designed to act in the stead of trucks or buses.<br /><br />When the dynamic duo's designs begin to interfere with the status quo of the major political and economic powers of the earth; of course it means war. Heinrich, when not genetically modifying himself into a giant stud-muffin and growing his own Pam Anderson-like wife, has been preparing for this eventuality. When the two scientists unleash metal-eating microbes, the compost really hits the fan.<br /><br />I agree with Connie Willis that great science fiction comes from taking a hypothesis and drawing it out to its most logical or most absurd conclusion. Leo Frankowski does just that in this book, letting the Polish uncle-nephew duo have complete free reign to design whatever absurd thing they can dream up without any real repercussions; universe builders remaking the earth as they want it. The humans in the story do not have much character development, but the little faun, Liebchen, and the LDU, Dirk, are really endearing as they grow and change in the struggle to understand human morality and ethics.<br /><br />I am surprised this book is so obscure; it is my favorite Frankowski book. If you have read any of his Conrad Stargard novels, you already know that the book is full of plenty of whiz-bang, neato ideas, male chauvinism, puns, but is overall a rollicking fun read.

Elizabeth Gilbert presents a mesmerizing, cheeky portrait of one of the most fascinating men in America today, Eustace Conway. I freely admit that Eustace, a man who lives (mostly) as if he were in the nineteenth century, and is on a mission to covert the rest of the nation, may not be fascinating by most people's standards.<br /><br />But I was fascinated by the unflinching honestly with which Gilbert described his loves, values and skills, as well as his flaws and emotional crises. Eustace wants to change the world by teaching people how to live like their ancestors, but is ironically crippled by his dysfunctional family history. (He wants everyone to learn from history, but he cannot learn from his own.) What makes the most impression, however, is Eustace's incredible, manic DRIVE. This brilliant man could be a captain of industry, find a cure for cancer, or be the commanding general of an army, yet he lives in the woods and gives all his energy to living the natural life as diligently and perfectly as possible. Gilbert provides plenty of background information, but it is up to the reader to decide how they think Eustace became this driving force.	2005-04-29

I get her e-mail newsletter (wonderful) and the owner of my local independent bookseller knows to keep a copy of her latest novel for me. So....I can't believe I'm saying this, but.....<br /><br />I had to force myself to finish this novel. The only other book of hers that left me less-than-giddy was SONGS OF THE HUMPBACK WHALE, for which I made the excuse that it was her first novel. This book starts out well, but I was expecting more mother-daughter, father-daughter emotional interaction. Most of the middle is taken up with the father, Andrew, and his experiences behind bars. I thought his actions were out of character for the man previously described  (and I really hope that was not the actual recipe for meth he describes using cat litter, pie pans and moth balls - more than I want to know). The ending goes back to the story-telling I expected, with the Picoult twist at the end which keeps you thinking long after the novel is finished.<br /><br />So, I'm sorry Jodi, but I really couldn't get into this one.

Like many other prisons, The Crotch is shut down and the entire population deposited on the planet Tartaros, named for the lowest level of hell, the galaxy's dumping ground for the unwanted. Soon after they are abandoned in the sandy desert of Tartaros, the seventeen thousand-plus population is reduced to three thousand. The remaining \\"sharks\\" decide they must band together if they want to survive, and elect a leader who makes Bando the first police officer of the newly-christened Razai gang. With the help of pre-teen killers, homicidal maniacs, and political dissidents, Bando makes up the brutally simple Law of the Razai as they travel in search of a place of refuge. In between trials and fights for survival against the gangs already in residence, Bando and his compatriots must think about the meaning of justice, and Bando examines his own heart to see if he is worthy of the trust placed in him.<br /><br />This edition contains all three books in the series: INFINITY HOLD, KILL ALL THE LAWYERS, and KEEP THE LAW, and features a lengthy introduction by the author (in which he hints that there may be more Tartaros books in the future).	2005-04-27

In fact, the reader never finds out satisfactorily what she was thinking that led to this unwholesome obsession with Steven Connolly, who is younger than her own children. What we do find out is exactly what the narrator of the story is thinking. This tale of scandal is told by Barbara Covett, a sixty-something spinster schoolteacher who befriends Sheba, less for her sparkling personality than for the chance to be in the epicenter of the scandal. Barbara's voice is clear and disturbing, she obviously has a history of obsessive, over-the-top relationships littering her past, such as the one she develops with Sheba. At times I was saying aloud \\"What a bitch!\\" and at others I entirely sympathized with Barbara and found her saying aloud thoughts I have had myself (scary though that sounds). One of the most fascinating and complete character portrayals I have read in a long time. You will be enthralled right through to the last chilling line.	2005-04-25

Ray is a quiet, lonely man who loves Livvy almost immediately, for reasons the reader cannot fathom. Livvy is diffident and stand-offish, out of touch with her feelings, but eventually falls for Ray, also for inexplicable reasons. The dialogue is stilted and strained, so it is hard to suspend disbelief with this improbable romance. The author instead spends much of the novel's time on the improbable sub-plot of Livvy's friendship and eventual betrayal by two Nisei sisters from the nearby Japanese internment camp.

After years of near-estrangement, both women are now in their later thirties and Rachel tries to re-connect with Beth by riding the city buses with her - Beth's obsession. Rachel finds that Beth has made a place for herself in a world other than the one her family would have chosen, and picked smart and caring mentors to help her on her journey. Rachel also realizes that Beth comes with the love and frustrations of any sister, \\"special\\" or not - one minute you want to hug her, the next you want to strangle her. Ultimately, this book is more about Rachel's journey to free herself from her emotional handicaps which are preventing her from having satisfying relationships.

(... well, maybe not that.) The premise is interesting, but I couldn't help but feeling that this book fell into the trap that is the downfall of so many science fiction novels, namely that the author spends too much time on the \\"gee-whiz, neato\\" concept, and not enough time on character development.

So, I was ready to enthusiastically devour this novel, the story of Susannah, the Edori snatched away to be the angelica despite her involvement with another man (mentioned as an old legend in the novel Archangel). I found this novel to be better written and more wholly developed than Archangel or Jovah's Angel, however the romance between Gaaron and Susannah was too flat and cookie-cutter. I couldn't see any way to differentiate them from Gabriel and Rachel, the protagonists from Archangel. However, the sub-plot of the maturation of Gaaron's troublesome sister Miriam was deeply satisfying. Shinn captures her personality perfectly.

In my opinion, Jane Eyre is a boring plot anyway and the depth of Jane's feelings is the only thing that makes it compelling reading, not whether on not what's-his-name will fall in love with her. I like this version much better because it is written in modern language and so much easier to read than the original.

Gregory uses modern language and expressions in her writing, so this novel does not drag a modern reader through a field of Thees and Thous, which IS more historically accurate, but frankly I am not interested in reading a novel that I have to translate. Lots of sexy court plotting and intrigue make this a page-turner perfect for beach reading or a rainy weekend, but I'm afraid serious history buffs will not appreciate the modern take on the story.	2005-02-11

Tommy is thrown into a brutal work camp with other illegal children, a place filled with unspeakable brutality and the aching sweetness of first love. He inevitably turns to studying the system which has enslaved him and discovers the key to the prophecy made by the all-knowing computer, Mac III, which runs this frighteningly believable world.

I was excited and intrigued by the concept of a novel written from the point of view of Amy Robsart, the long-suffering wife of Robert Dudley, the love of Queen Elizabeth's life. However, the book was mostly about Robert, and both the women in his life were portrayed as whiny, annoying, and more than a little crazy. Serious fans of Elizabeth will not be amused.

The story is told from the point of view of his oldest son, Charlie. I can't help but wonder how the narration would have been different from other family members' points of view, especially the mother, whose name was not mentioned once, as far as I remember. Allie is insane in the manner of Hitler, Mussolini or some other dictator, but his only population to control is one family and some unsuspecting natives. He would obviously like to remake the world in his own image if given the chance. He makes a model village in the jungle called Jeronimo, where he is king of a warped kingdom. Disaster, of course, is not far away. I had a hard time reading this because my mind kept wandering trying to diagnose Allie. (Bipolar with 95% of the time in a state of mania?) Just when I thought the family's situation could not get more desperate, it did. This book is very good but so depressing I found it very hard to finish. Read it if you want a voyeuristic look at a family tragedy and the insane proclamations of a madman.

The best kind of science fiction, the \\"What If?\\" In this novel he raises the question: What if the consciousness of everyone on Earth was suddenly twenty years in the future and everyone glimpsed their future lives for two minutes? The ramifications are staggering from a psychological perspective. Is everything pre-determined or do we have free will?<br /><br />As in Sawyer's other novels, the characters discuss all the scientific theories and ramifications of this accident in great detail that frankly will go right over the head of some readers. (My friend found these parts mind-numbingly boring) Boring or not, I am really surprised at the extent and length of the griping other reviewers have done over the viability of the science.

Since it is 1938, there is almost no possibility of Daniel Poloski getting a job with his disability, so they must live off charity in this small town full of gossipy, nosy neighbors.<br /><br />Amy knows how to handle herself in town and at school; how to act and what to say to fit in. But one day there is a new boy at school, Jason Fitzmaurice, who does not and seems doomed never to learn. At first Amy thinks he is crazy, then feels sorry for him when the school bully repeatedly beats him up. By surreptitious means, Amy helps foil Jason's attackers and inadvertently makes a friend.<br /><br />Jason is not scared of the abandoned shack in Stone Hollow where several people have died, and everyone in town is sure is haunted. Jason drags Amy up to the hollow, where they find a megalithic stone in a grotto. Jason says the stone is a focus of some mysterious power, and he claims to see Indians and the people who once lived in Stone Hollow. Is he telling the truth, or is he crazy as Amy first thought?	2004-07-29

I have a mental image of him pulling two pieces of paper out of a bag, and he must write a novel about these two things. One paper says [Man unjustly accused of molesting his daughters] and the other says [Earth receives message from outer space]. I found the novel very enjoyable, a quick read, but not dumbed-down like a lot of fiction these days. I couldn't help but notice the similarities to Carl Sagan's CONTACT: a message from an extraterrestrial civilization with instructions for a machine to be built. In fact, this is the fourth or fifth Sawyer book I've read and I dimly recall him mentioning Sagan several times. I must agree with other reviewers that the characters were flat and cliched. Sitting here now the only character I can remember with any distinction is Cheetah, the artificial intelligence computer.	2004-07-27

The main characters from the first two books of this series, BELOW THE ROOT and AND ALL BETWEEN, are back, along with a cast of hundreds. The two girls from different cultures, Teera and Pomma, are the focus of the Rejoyning, the integrating of the Kindar and the Erdlings into one society. The girls soon find out that it is no fun to be revered as messiah figures; in fact it puts them in danger from the splinter groups on each side who want society to remain as it was before the Rejoyning.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this book, like everything else that Ms. Snyder has written, but making myself finish was a grueling chore. The plot is most likely too convoluted and politically significant for children to read. It is two hundred pages of all the minutiae of council meetings and political machinations to try and integrate two societies. Instead of being written from the children's perspective like the first two books, this one is mainly told by adults and details the boring grown-up concerns, like supply distribution. None of the charm or magic of the first two books. What a yawn! Only read this if you want a detailed account of integrating two superstitious, bigoted societies.	2004-07-27

Molly has inherited a little money from an uncle and they decide to spend the year in Italy so she can explore art. The story is told from the children's point of view, mainly David's. Tesser, Blair and Janey act exactly as before, almost stereotypically so. However, there is no recurrence of the spooky happenings from Blair that made CUPID so wonderful. Amanda has reverted to teenage surliness after her about-face at the end of CUPID and is (again stereotypically) a real pain about the move she doesn't want to make.<br /><br />The kidnapping takes place after Amanda brags that her father is a rich movie-maker in California to impress the Italian kids in school. Instead of just Amanda, the kidnappers end up with all five Stanley children and find it is much more than they can handle. The children finally free themselves mostly by frustrating the kidnappers to no end. An enjoyable read, but not as good or memorable as THE HEADLESS CUPID.	2004-07-27

Their discussions are satisfyingly deep and far ranging: paleontology, cosmology, biology, genetics, theology, evolution, faith, morality, friendship. The human scientist, Tom, is dying of terminal cancer, which lends extra weight to his introspection, and the alien, Hollus, is thoughtful, sensitive, and a lot more three-dimensional than many characters in fiction (expecially science fiction). A very satisfying read, which will have me pondering some of it imponderables for a long time to come.	2004-07-21

The clash of cultures makes for good books, but I have personally always been more interested in the Ages of Chaos and the Hundred Kingdoms, when it is said use of laran science for nefarious purposes was widespread. This book, to my great delight, takes place in this time!<br /><br />This book tells the story of Queen Tanquiel Hastur-Acosta, who escapes the depradations of the conquerer Damien Deslucido and his evil laranzu brother, Rumail. She escapes her besieged castle and makes her way across land to try and reach her kinsmen in Thendara. Along the way, she meets under-keeper Coryn Leynier, whose home has also fallen to the evil Deslucido, who is traveling to his new post at Neskaya tower. They form a deep and lasting mental bond when Coryn saves her life during a raging blizzard. With his help she is able to reach the home of her powerful uncle, King Rafael Hastur II. There she gives birth to her son, the next king of Acosta, and fights the political machinations of Deslucido and tries to regain control of her son's birthright.  Finally, when it is discovered that Deslucido can lie under truthspell, King Hastur acts, and the evil marauder is finally defeated. Coryn and the other tower workers in Neskaya and Tramontana are drawn into this terrible battle which rages on the physical world and in the Overworld as well.<br /><br />I thought this was a very good, engrossing read. Bradley's writing always seemed to me to be sparse on descriptions, very down-and-dirty. So, this book was a pleasant change in some ways, it seemed more complete and satisfied my curiosity. However, the long drawn-out discussions of political machinations and the long battle with Deslucido were a bit too much for me. Some prudent editing would have been nice, IMHO. I kept thinking \\"Isn't it over YET? I want to get to the ending!\\"	2004-07-20

Not only does that mean the usual mood swings and hormone surges, but also the surges of Romilly's awakening laran. Romilly has the MacAran gift of rapport with animals in full measure. Her overbearing father, Dom Mikhail, loves her as his favorite, but will not bend in his views of what is right in their society; that women should stay at home and embroider while men work with hawks and hounds. Mikhail also does not believe in tower training to control laran, and Romilly's beloved older brother, Ruyven, also strongly gifted with laran, fled home to take a place as laranzu in Tramontana tower against his father's wishes.<br /><br />Romilly is unhappy under her father's autocratic rule, (as is her other older brother who is ironically berated for not having the family laran) but is hopeful until her father gives away her prized hawk and pledges her hand in marriage to a fat, greasy, older lord who has already lost multiple wives in childbirth. Romilly cuts her hair, puts on boy's clothes, and takes to the forest. She has many adventures and gets embroiled in the battle to restore the rightful Hastur King to the throne of Darkover, a battle in which she unsurprisingly plays a major part.<br /><br />Romilly is very like Menolly from Anne McCaffrey's DRAGONSONG books. She is very sensitive and talented, subjected to emotional abuse (and a little physical abuse by her family-especially her father) and she suffers from low self-esteem. Her feelings of injustice are keenly felt and heart-rending. She grows and matures as she comes into her talent and is instrumental in helping a respected surrogate father figure. I first read this book as a teen, and found the angst and righteous indignation of Romilly tore at my heart. It still does. Would highly recommend this, especially to teen girls.	2004-07-20

This book is written in the voices of the four daughters and the mother, which I thought were each distinct and believable. It is fascinating to see the exploration of faith, love, hate, ego, and bigotry as it is played out among the stranded Price women and the increasingly insane Nathan Price. Unlike the typical novel, which would have probably ended when the Price women finally left Nathan, this one continues on so that you find out what happened to the girls after they grew up.

This is the story of how the shy and chubby Martha, who feels that she cannot measure up to her superstar family, meets Ivy, the free-spirited, imaginative daughter of the town's most notorious family. Martha becomes Ivy's home and family, and Ivy brings Martha out of her shell and helps her to see her full potential. A story that is truly timeless and everyone can relate to - whether the reader is currently experiencing the painful awkwardness of childhood or simply remembering it. Everyone can remember how it feels to not fit in anywhere, and innocently do things that you are ridiculed and teased for. I think everyone knew a rich bitch in school, someone who was sweet as sugar to adults, but a little two-faced sneak to other kids. Too bad everyone couldn't have Martha's wonderful experience of having a friend like Ivy.	2004-07-16

It is told from the point of view of Teera, the Erdling child who was rescued by Neric and Raamo and taken to Green-sky. The book starts back at Teera's home in the caverns below &quot;The Root&quot; and shows how their society is marred by strife and hunger. The food allocation committee decides her pet lapan (something similar to a rabbit) must be killed and eaten for food. Teera, desperate to keep her pet, runs away from home and wanders down the endless corridors until she is hopelessly lost, then squeezes through an opening in the root into the forest above.<br /><br /> At first Teera is enchanted by the green forest and the abundance of food, but soon is full of homesickness. Just as she is about to give up hope, she is found by Raamo and Neric, novitiate Ol-zhaan priests from the cities of Green-sky high in the trees. Raamo can hear her telepathic cries for help, and also through telepathy (pensing) calms her enough for the trip up into the city of Orbora. There they place Teera in the care of Raamo's family, where she immediately forms a deep bond with Raamo's sister of the same age, Pomma.<br /><br /> Teera tries to keep the secret of her origins, but her hosts soon find out she is not a child from their city who fell, but was born and lived below the root. Raamo's fellow initiate, Genaa, learns that her father is not really dead, but was imprisoned below the root by the evil machinations of the secret society within the Ol-zhaan priests called the Greets-kel. When Genaa leads a party to the forest floor to make contact with the inhabitants of the caverns, chaos is let loose in Green-sky.	2004-07-15

In book one of Snyder's unforgettable Green-sky trilogy, thirteen year-old Raamo is chosen to be one of the elite Ol-zhaan priests. The Kindar people live in cities within giant trees and live off the products of the magical Wissenvine. 'The Vine' provides fruits, building materials, and the roots ('The Root') cover the mysterious forest floor so that the evil Pash-shan are imprisioned below.<br />As Raamo progresses in his training, he learns the history of the Kindar people, how they came from another planet ravaged by war and the first Ol-zhaan were determined to eradicate these emotions from subsequent generations. Now the Kindar know nothing of violence, war, or any original thought for that matter. The people chant proscribed chants of peace and live a very restricted existence where they are not allowed to even look at the forest floor. Raamo is befriended by Neric, another young Ol-zhaan healer, who urges him to re-think everything they have been told about life in Green-sky and the supposedly evil Pash-shan monsters.<br />Neric and Raamo take a dangerous trip to the forest floor, where they find eight-year-old Teera lost in the forest. Assuming she is a child who has fallen from the trees, they take her back to Green-sky and leave her in the care of Raamo?s family. When they learn that little Teera is not a Kindar, but a Pash-shan, or Erdling as they call themselves, their world is turned upside down.<br />Excellent fantasy for any age. The Kindar and Erdlings are a little reminiscent of the Morlocks and Eloi in The Time Machine. Another fantastic book that has a very similar story is THE GIVER by Lois Lowry.	2004-07-13

Sawyer creates a fascinating world which is inhabited with Neanderthals and shows us how their society works. It is very interesting to see our world through their eyes, to examine our belief systems and the structure of our society.

Here are murderers, bigots, small-minded busybodies. Jane Goncalves and her foster children left the big city to escape these things, but find themselves embroiled in controversy and strife. Sam Rockwell exists in a shadowy purgatory of grief after losing his beloved wife to cancer. Sam and Jane come together in the face of adversity and form a deep bond, showing that the best families aren't necessarily related by blood.	2004-07-08

In this book Robin, middle daughter in a large, poor family during the Depression, finds just such a place in the Velvet Room. This is Robin's name for the library in the old McCurdy mansion on Las Palmeras, the California rancho where her family is working picking apricots. Robin loves the library with its precious historical artifacts and wide window seats hidden behind thick velvet curtains. Robin hides from reality in the Velvet Room until she reaches a crossroads and realizes what is most important to her. This book was, and still is a favorite.

What makes her famous is that another white person stumbled upon them first, Charles Corgie, a handsome charlatan who had the tribe believing he was a god. Instead of blowing Corgie's cover, Gray stayed on in the village as his co-goddess and observed the interplay until the bitter end. (This episode is deserving of a book in its own right, and I was disappointed that it was only a few chapters.)<br /><br />In late middle age, the eternally youthful Gray is firmly established in the university system, queen of all she surveys, worshipped as a goddess by her assistant, Erroll. Then Raphael Sarasota enters the picture. Through this young man who looks so much like Corgie, Gray is able to unleash her sexual fantasies and finally finds that she actually needs another human being. A large part of the narrative is made up of Erroll's clever fantasies about Gray and Raphael. Raphael uses and discards Gray, who is painfully oblivious despite everyone's warnings. Ms. Shriver again masterfully describes the inner workings of a difficult, perhaps even unlikable, character. For another fabulously written character study, read WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN.	2004-06-28

Mariana is an orphan in ancient Rome during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. She is raised by the loving family of Marianus, who trains her in his very unfeminine craft of goldsmithing. After her adoptive mother dies of dysentery, Mariana, still feverish with illness, is visited by spirits. Word of this phenomenon spreads throughout Rome, even reaching the emperor's ears. Marcus Aurelius sends for Mariana to investigate the phenomenon and she heals him of dropsy in his legs. After this the spirits settle and life returns to normal for her family. The healing gift returns in little spurts over the years, which Mariana uses to ease her family's aches and pains.<br />Twelve years later, Mariana is again summoned by the emperor. Now a young woman of twenty, she is reluctant to go and does not believe in her ability to heal. In the emperor's presence, Mariana meets the man who is to change her life, the Chinese Ambassador Lin Pao-jan, called Paulus. He has been sent by the Chinese emperor to find and bring a healer back to China. They ask Mariana to go on this journey, but she refuses, and in the end the Ambassador kidnaps her from her home.<br />What follows is a two-year journey along the Silk Road over mountains and through harsh deserts. A strong love-hate relationship develops between Mariana and the Ambassador, and she also struggles to explore her talent and find inner peace. When they finally reach China, she learns that Paulus kidnapped her not to heal the emperor, but his own beloved twin brother who is dying of consumption. Mariana tries to marshal the strange forces of the god Apollo, but can only ease the brother's pain into death. Racked with grief, Mariana is summoned to the presence of the Son of Heaven, the emperor of China. She is asked to heal his three-year-old son who has taken a tumble down the stairs. Marshaling all her inner strength, Mariana plunges into the dream world of the child's coma and brings him back out. She is rewarded with her freedom to return to Rome.<br />This is the turning point in Mariana's relationship with Paulus. They finally admit their attraction to one another and become lovers. After many months of persuasion by Paulus and his family, they marry. Paulus is soon killed by an arrow and Mariana decides to journey back to Rome to the family she has so missed and loved. After she leaves, she realizes she is pregnant with her daughter Paula, whom she gives birth to on the long journey back to Rome. There she is reunited with her loving family, and eventually with Paulus when she dies. Ruth Nichols hints at the idea of reincarnation throughout the book and especially at the end when Mariana is reunited with the spirit of Paulus. I cannot understand why this book is shelved with the children's books at the library. Perhaps only because Nichols wrote two other children's adventure books. The historical facts about journeys along the Silk Road before the time of Marco Polo are spot-on, and findings and research done since the publication of this book have only served to reinforce what is laid out here. The characters were a little flat, but overall it was a good read if you are a fan of history.child's coma and brings him back out.

One day they walk into a glowing wood near their home and are transported into another world, whose night is filled with blue and purple stars, and whose woods are full of dwarves and Kobolds. Eventually they learn from the very long-lived Lady Iorwen they are the descendants of the king (Lady Iorwen's son) who went missing and was presumed dead five hundred years ago. Judith and Tobit go through many episodes of physical danger before the final confrontation with Hagerrak, a long-lived usurper who rules the kingdom rightfully belonging to the royal household of the Wanderer.<br />This book would be an appealing adventure if the characters were more fully developed. They are portrayed with stilted emotions only in fits and starts, and the whole construction of this unnamed land and its inhabitants seems liberally borrowed from the likes of Tolkien or C. S. Lewis, but without the depth of development. Perhaps this is due to the style in which it is written, which wavers between common third person and the overly simplistic voice of an impersonal narrator.	2004-06-11

There is an old axiom that romance stories by women end in happily-ever-after and romances by men end in death, and that holds true in this case. I found the romance cloying, flat and one-sided.

American society has become more stratified than before, where the wealthy working class called \\"Donkeys\\" literally buy votes by providing bread and circuses for a large uneducated welfare population called \\"Livers\\". Of particular interest is the character of Drew Arlen, a young Liver who wants to raise himself above his birth and be on par with the Super Sleepless.

This is the story of one such child built to the specifications of her wealthy industrialist father, Leisha Camden, who is beautiful, blonde, intelligent, and who does not need to sleep. The story follows Leisha's growing up in an America that gradually grows to hate and resent Leisha and her peers. Leisha is one of the most three-dimensional characters I have ever read, and I agonized with her over the moral decisions she was forced to make. Calls into question everyone's rights as citizens and human beings. Was there ever a good decision made by committee? Is any man good enough to govern another without their consent? Like Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, but without the mind-numbing twenty-page speeches. Every time I read this novel, I get something different from it. A perennial favorite, I cannot recommend it enough if you like a good moral dilemma.	2004-06-07

Instead, the book is about Piemur, Menolly's friend, whose golden voice changes with puberty, and he is forced to reassess his life. Piemur runs away from Harper Hall and finds adventure in the jungles of the Southern Continent. Menolly is mentioned here and there, so we find out what happens to her. Maybe it's because I'm female, but I just couldn't get as attached to Piemur, as immersed in his world. Still a great book by one of my favorite authors.	2004-06-07

When Christopher finds a neighbor's dog impaled on a garden fork, he decides to solve the mystery of the dog's death. While Christopher does not feel much of an emotional connection to most people (including his own father), he feels that the dog's death is heinous murder. In the course of his investigation, he finds out much more than he bargains for. A really interesting look at the thought processes of the autistic. I found myself laughing to keep from crying at some of the situations Christopher gets himself into, and felt great sympathy for his working-class parents who seem more than a little overwhelmed by Christopher's care.	2004-06-03

Great Character Study	I was so blown away by this novel, the minute I finished reading it, I turned to page one to read it again. Eva Khatchadourian is without a doubt the deepest, most three-dimensional character I have ever read. There were many times when I did not agree with what she did, or even particularly like her, but Eva seemed too real to be fictional. The novel is a series of letters written by Eva to her husband Franklin, and they are so brutally honest they may as well be written in blood. I felt like an eavesdropper at Eva's therapy sessions as she recounted the chronology of her marriage to Franklin, then their decision to have a child when Eva is 37 (before time runs out). Eva agonizes over every doubt, every misgiving, every bit of selfishness and negative feelings about being a mother from conception until the present day. With good reason. In the present day, Kevin is in prison for murder, another school shooter. Lionel Shriver creates a compelling, thought-provoking novel which shows that we need not sympathize only with the victims of random violence. This would be a great book for a book club (but the lenghty introspection is definitely not for everyone). I talked about it for hours to whoever would listen, welcoming debates about nature versus nurture, capital punishment, etc.	2004-06-03

She is forced to face opposition and prejudice from the music masters and her fellow students. However, the care and understanding the MasterHarper, Robinton, give her make the transition less painful. So do the friendships of Piemur, an impish singing apprentice, Sebell, a journeyman harper and Robinton's right-hand man, and Camo, the sweet but dull-witted kitchen drudge. Menolly faces her demons and triumphs in true fairy-tale fashion. Another favorite book, read so many times it is in tatters.	2004-05-28

I think of it often and dig out my tattered paperback to re-read it and always pick up something new.<br />This is the story of Margaret Redmond, who dies of asthma at the age of seventeen in the year 1900. She finds herself in a strange \\"heaven\\" where she meets Paul, a member of a large Chinese family who lives in a great compound. Paul's grandmother, the matriarch of the clan, has predicted that Margaret will destroy the compound. Margaret does not understand this, or anything else at first. She begins to remember other lives, one as an Indian slave, Zawumatec; another as a sailor's wife named Elizabeth; and finally the life in ancient Sumer, where she was a doomed prince named Tirigan. Margaret must confront the lessons learned in these lives and the curse and hatred that have clung to her throughout the centuries before she can find peace and learn who \\"Paul\\" really is. A moving tale of reincarnation and the power love and hate have in shaping our destinies.	2004-05-27

When the father's business falls on hard times, Beauty and her two older, more beautiful, sisters move with their father to a meager cottage on the edge of a thick forest. The forest, they soon learn, has a sinister reputation. The father is lost in the woods and takes refuge in a mysterious castle where the Beast lives. Beauty's father takes a rose as a gift for her, and the Beast demands payment of Beauty as compensation. Fearful at first, Beauty comes to know the Beast over the months she lives in the castle. Eventually, Beauty admits that she loves the Beast and the spell is broken. The Beast is now a handsome, rich nobleman in a castle full of servants. Over the course of her stay, Beauty has grown older, taller and beautiful. I only wish the story had continued on to show how the couple copes with their new circumstances. One especially delightful touch is Beast's magical library, which contains books not yet in existence, like Bleak House.	2004-05-26

I expected from the title that there would be some sort of revenge ala The First Wives Club, but no. Rose's revenge is more like validation, when her erring husband's new relationship is not all wine and roses. The way Rose is so wrapped up in her garden and many unfamiliar British slang words may be off-putting for American readers. I also thought the beginning was slow, it seemed like a long setup before the action started, but overall a pretty good read.	2004-05-25

His jumps seem to center around a few locations or catastrophic emotional events. In a large number of jumps, he ends up in the meadow outside of Clare Abshire's house. So, Clare knows and loves an older Henry, whom she has known since she was six. But in Henry's timeline, he does not meet Clare until she is twenty. Confused? Sometimes it is, but also very compelling and hard to put down. If my husband had not forced me to go to bed, I would have read this in one sitting.	2004-05-24

These three meet an odd assortment of bedsheet-stealing old ladies, Mrs. Who, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Which. The ladies are not what they appear, and whisk the children away on a quest to find Meg and Charles' missing father on the far-away planet of Camazotz, where everyone is perfectly alike, to their detriment. L'Engle's deceptively simple prose evokes the warmth of love and the chill of fear with equal facility. If you have not read this, you are never too old.	2004-05-24

His parents, only under-educated teenagers at the time, believed in the expertise of John Money at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Dr. Money told them the best course was to castrate the baby and raise him as a girl, that nurture was more important than nature; gender could be changed with willpower, surgery and hormone treatments. The book recounts Brenda's lonely, mixed-up childhood and the devastating effect it had on the entire family. I was filled with rage at Dr. Money, who only wanted to promote his theories and stroke his own ego, no matter what the cost to patients or their families. This book is doubly devastating after hearing the news that David Reimer (formerly Brenda) had killed himself in May, 2004 at the age of 38.	2004-05-20
