From the Book Flap - Chio would cry to her husband Goro, whenever she forgot something - which was very often. Except for her bad memory, she was a good Japanese wife, and the old couple tended their farm together happily. <br /> <br />One night Chio and Goro lay on their mats talking about what they would be in their next life. Goro decided that he would become a fox. Chio agreed to be a fox too, a clever one that would never forget anything. Then they went to sleep and a few hours later Goro slipped away into the next life. That same night a tiny red fox was born to a mother fox in a nearby forest. <br /> <br />Chio made plans to join Goro soon, but when she was ready to go, she suddenly could not remember what animal she decided to be. A dog? A rabbit? A bear? Poor Chio! Finally she decided that in her next life she would be a chicken. That night in a nearby farmyard, a tiny chick was born to a mother hen. <br /> <br />Meanwhile Goro's fox mother was training him to raid the chicken coop and catch a plump young chicken for their supper. What happened when Goro the fox encountered Chio the chicken is just the beginning of many amusing surprises in the many lives of Chio and Goro before they are reunited in the same form.	2005-07-12

I began reading with much anticipation after accumulating a somewhat large collection of material about the tornado and the reconstruction. Like many other publications, Mr. Laffoon all but ignores the Pinecrest neighborhood and surrounding houses, including those on Marshall Rd. located behind the completely destroyed High School. These were the last neighborhoods/houses hit before continuing on to Wilborforce and Central State Universities. My house and many others were unsalvagable. Mr. Laffoon's rare mentions of my neighborhood concern the so-called racist response to our two new neighbors, teachers and officials of Central State University and their families. I heartily disagree with this OPINION of Mr. Laffoon's. My Mother and we two girls went over to the Dean of Students' house with baked goods and welcomed them to the neighborhood. Both my brother and my sister were friends with age-mates of the other family who moved there. I am sure we weren't the only friendly people in the neighborhood. While it is slightly understandable that publications somewhat ignored my neighborhood and the surrounding area, as the devastation wasn't as complete as the Arrowhead neighborhoods - This finger-pointing about my neighborhood is uncalled for and not factual.	2005-04-24
