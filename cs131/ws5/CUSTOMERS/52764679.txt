He is supposed to be a shoo-in for a prestigious appointment at Oxford's Mercy College.  They are shocked when he is not chosen.  The man that is chosen, Edgar Stone, is a womanizer and is not well liked. <br /> <br />Stone is found dead, and Peter is accused.  Catherine does everything she can to prove he's innocent.  Unfortunately the police have a call from Stone saying that Peter is there threatening him with a knife right before he's found dead. <br /> <br />Her daughter and ex-husband have hired a solicitor, but he doesn't seem to be much help.  Her relationship with her daughter is tenuous at best, and these circumstances really wear on it.  Plus Catherine and her ex-husband run into each other more than Catherine would want.  This adds a lot of tension in the family. <br /> <br />I am not a big fan of mysteries set in England.  I think one of the reasons I like this series is that it is an American who has moved to England.  So often she will explain the idiosyncrasies I would otherwise not understand.   <br /> <br />Catherine is an enjoyable character.  I like seeing England through her eyes.

In walks Molly Saint.  She wants them to look into her husband's past.  The McKenzie's, especially Greg, are initially skeptical about taking this case.  Molly has been married to Damon Saint for five years.  But, Jill has a feeling that something isn't right and convinces Greg to do some preliminary investigations.  If they don't find anything alarming, they will stop. <br /> <br />They are already working for Leisure Foods Group investigating missing funds from a King Cole specialty restaurant.  Jill goes undercover as hostess in the restaurant.  Greg gets friends to eat there so that they can determine if the money they pay to the restaurant is actually accounted for in the deposit the next day. <br /> <br />The day they met with Mr. Logan from Leisure Foods Group in the Opryworld Hotel, Dr. Elliott Bernstein, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, was gunned down at the hotel.   Since Greg used to be an investigator for the DA's office, he knows some officers.  But since he left that job after some comments he made about Detective Mark Tremaine ended up in the newspaper, he doesn't get along with many of the officers.  The one officer that is still his friend is Detective Phil Adamson. <br /> <br />Once Molly disappears, the McKenzie's begin to delve deeply into Damon's background.  They never lose sight of their other cases, but this one has become priority.   <br /> <br />The Greg McKenzie series is fast becoming one of my all-time favorite series.  Mr. Campbell has a great way of telling a story while weaving the various cases that Greg and Jill are working on.  I find his characters to be very believable.  I like that they don't just center on one case.  That's not how it is in real life. <br /> <br />I like the Nashville setting.  And the fact that Jill is a pilot and owns a Cessna allows them to travel to gain additional information and not lose much time.  <br /> <br />The only complaint I'd have is that they turn off their cell phone too much, especially during important cases.  But, since they are older, this is still believable <br /> <br />I can't wait to read the next Greg McKenzie mystery.  I highly recommend this book and the whole series. <br /> <br />	2005-08-26

Some actions in Liz's past have put them in a sticky situation that comes to a head in this book.   <br /> <br />A past lover and ex-employee of Liz's, David Hayes who is now paroled, contacts her upon his release.  He embezzled millions from the bank where she works.  No one ever found the money when he went to prison. <br /> <br />Now he's trying to enlist her help to get the money for the Russian mob, who he stole it from, before they kill him.  She tells Lou about her past affair.  In the meantime, Lou's long-time friend and fellow cop, Danny Foreman, enlists Lou to help him track down David Hayes.  While Lou has a hard time with the affair, he knows his family will never be free without David Hayes being brought to justice. <br /> <br />There are so many twists and turns in this book, it is very difficult to figure out exactly who the good guys and the bad guys are, let alone figure out the whole mystery.  It is a very fast-paced, action packed book.  It is hard to put down.  You always want to read just a little more to find out what happens. <br /> <br />I have always enjoyed the Lou Boldt series, but I think this was a great diversion from the normal way the story was told.  It also gave me a better sense of the relationship between Lou and Liz.  I liked that.  I can't wait to read the next book in this series!  I highly recommend this book and the whole series. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-25

She is hiding out from the law and her ex-husband. <br /> <br />This time she's working at Page Turners Bookstore.  With her love of books, she thought this would be the perfect job.  Wrong.  Not only is the caliber of customers low, but her boss, Page Turner III, is the pits.  Plus the stores appear to be on a downward spiral. <br /> <br />Her apartment complex, The Coronado Tropic Apartments, become infested with termites.  The residents are all forced to move out for the weekend while the complex is tented and bombed. <br /> <br />Her landlady treats Helen to an enjoyable weekend at the beach.  Her new boyfriend, Dr. Rich, comes to spend it with her.   <br /> <br />But, when they return to the Coronado, they find Page Turner III dead with a knife in his back, on a bed in one of the apartments.  How could this happen?  Did anyone at the Coronado even know him?  Plus, the apartments had been locked down and tented. <br /> <br />Suspects are not is short supply.  Helen's friend Peggy is arrested.  Apparently she had been engaged to Page some time before and had threatened him.  Helen investigates to help get Peggy released.  She feels Peggy knows something but won't tell her.  Could it have been his wife, one of the female authors he took advantage of, or one of Helen's co-workers? <br /> <br />I really enjoy this series.  Helen is a lot of fun, and the characters she works and lives with always add to the story.  Fort Lauderdale is a terrific setting, too.  There are plenty of twists and turns before the killer is revealed so that it is not easy to figure out who the killer is. <br /> <br />This series is a great cozy series.

But due to time and money constraints, she vows to do the best she can with what she has to work with. <br /> <br />While removing the paneling in Carl's bedroom, Erin discovers her baby picture and some letters.

Erin has a tough time knowing what to do.   <br /> <br />Then Randy keels over and dies at the hospital.  Apparently he was poisoned.  Someone shoots at Erin's car.   <br /> <br />Things keep heating up and Erin soon feels she has to discover the truth about her adoption, as well as figure out who killed Randy. <br /> <br />I enjoyed Erin Gilbert and the tension between her and Steve Sullivan.  The contest was very believable with all the reality t.v. shows.  But since I'm not into interior design, I found there to often be too much description for my liking.

This search ends up taking her out of Texas for a few days. <br /> <br />When Meagan's uncle is murdered, Meagan asks Abby to help find who killed the two men.

This is the second in the series.  It is great.  I can't wait for the next one!  Abby is such a great character.  She is full of spunk and has wonderful people around her to assist her and support her.  Of course, there are those like Aunt Caroline, who you can't always tell if they really have her best interests at heart. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. <br />	2005-02-15

Then Corliss is found murdered in the cemetery.  He is clutching a piece of paper that brings Quill into the investigation.      Quill starts hearing rumors of a large hotel being built in town.  She and Marge end up doing some late night investigation to find out more.  Plus Marge's ex-husband Boomer is in town.  No one even knew she was married before.  One morning Marge asks Quill to help her find Boomer as he didn't show up for their meeting.  He is apparently dependable to be where he says he will be.  Unfortunately they find he's had an \\"accident\\" and has been decapitated.    Quill begins to wonder if the two murders are related.  She begins digging to try to find the link.  She ends up putting herself in danger before unmasking the killer.    I love this series.  Meg and Quill are so likeable.

She was a rower.  She tries to interview Denali's roommate and an ex-boyfriend.  The more she digs, the more she questions everything her client has told her.  Plus she finds more pieces to investigate the deeper she gets. <br /> <br />Plus Carlotta is dating Leon, an FBI agent she met on her last job.  Carlotta isn't sure where this relationship is going.

I don't feel that she puts herself in dangerous situations without the proper tools like in many mysteries.  This is very believable.  I like the way that she is able to find out the needed information without just calling someone else to find out everything.

That always makes a book more real to me.  The characters and their interactions were well written. <br /> <br />I recommend this book. <br />	2004-12-16

Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher and family are to gather for Christmas at Brockdene, Lord Westmoor's estate in Cornwell, with her mother Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple.  Daisy arrives ahead to get some information for an article she is writing on Brockdene.   <br /> <br />Once Daisy arrives, she finds that not only will Lord Westmoor not be joining them, they will be joined by The Norvilles, some poor relations who live there.  She is sure her mother was not made aware of this information and wonders how she will handle it when she arrives. <br /> <br />Daisy soon realizes that the Norvilles are mostly unhappy people.  It is discovered that Susannah Norville, the family matriarch, arrived at the state many years ago to find out her husband Albert had drowned and his family would not accept her word that they had been married.  So her sons were not given their birthrights as earls.  Her son Captain Norville has arrived with Reverend Calloway.  Daisy doesn't know immediately what the purpose of his visit is.  Then he is found murdered in the chapel.   <br /> <br />Daisy's husband, Alec, didn't want anyone to know he was a Scotland Yard Inspector.  But once the local police are contacted and it is soon apparent Scotland Yard will be called in, he has to step up and run the investigation.  He calls for his team to come assist him. <br /> <br />Alec's young daughter, Belinda, and her cousin Derek, have been enjoying investigating the house.  Many desks are supposed to have hidden compartments.  They discover some of them and then find some valuable clues for the investigation.  <br /> <br />I found Daisy, Alec, Belinda and Derek to be very entertaining characters.  I think they really made this story.  Normally I don't read many books set in London or back in time.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this book to be a very enjoyable read.  I recommend this book. <br />	2004-12-15

She hasn't seen or heard from Molly for ten years.  They were best friends in school even though they were not of the same social class.  Molly was a scholarship student.  Andy was a debutate, although she never really ran in her mother's high society circles and is now a debutante dropout. <br /> <br />Molly is being charged with murdering her boss, Bud Hartman.  She asks Andy to help her out.  Andy gets her mother Cissy, much to her chagrin, to call a lawyer for Molly.  Andy ends up dropping off Molly's six-year-old son David at Cissy's doorstep while she tries to help get Molly out of jail. <br /> <br />Brian Malone does not impress Andy as a go-getter attorney.  She doesn't feel he is really looking out for Molly's best interests.  So, Andy decides to go under cover as a waitress at Jugs, a Hooters-type restaurant, where Molly had worked.  For some reason Julie, Bud's girlfriend who now runs Jugs, takes a liking to Andy.  She ends up inviting her to Bud's funeral.  Why would Reverend Jim-Bob, a well-known televangelist be willing to preside over Bud's funeral? <br /> <br />Then there's the Mothers Against Pornography run by nurse Peggy Martin.  Why is she so adamant against Jugs?   <br /> <br />Where is this waitress that left overnight a few weeks before?  Why did she leave and never even return for her paycheck? <br /> <br />Andy finds herself in some interesting and even dangerous situations as she tries to discover who really killed Bud and framed Molly.   <br /> <br />This is the first book I've read in this series, but it won't be the last.  I truly enjoyed Andy and her antics.  I think she and Malone will make a good team in future books.  They feed off each other really well.  Her mother really adds character to the story as well.  I found myself laughing out loud several times while reading this book.  I highly recommend it. <br />	2004-12-15

Morgue Mama and Aubrey forge a great partnership.  Soon they are working together to try to prove that Sissy James did not poison TV evangelist Rev. Buddy Wing.

I can't wait for the next book! <br /> <br />Ms. Connor presents her intricate knowledge of forensics in a way that is understandable by lay people.  It makes it much more enjoyable to understand how and why they can figure out the crime. <br /> <br /> The characters in this series work well together.  She has come up with a way to intertwine the museum and crime lab.  This is a winning series. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book!  If you missed the first one, One Grave Too Many, I recommend you read it as well. <br />	2004-10-11

Since this is set in England, it doesn't surprise me that I had some trouble reading it.  If you like series set in England, you will probably like it more than I. <br /> <br />The Hopwicke Country House Hotel has hit some hard times.  Owner Suzy Longthorne has reduced her staff and has had to welcome groups she might not have in the past.  The Pillars of Sussex, an elitist men's group, is one such group.  They are holding one of their social gatherings at the hotel.  Since it will revolve around much drinking, they have all booked rooms for the night. <br /> <br />Jude has been hired by her friend Suzy to help with waitressing the event.  She helps Nigel, a young man supposedly an initiate for Pillar membership, up to his room after having drunk too much.  He talks about wanting to marry Wendy.  The next morning Jude discoverrs him hanging from the beam of the four-poster bed in his room.  It is determined it to be suicide.  Jude does not agree.  She enlists her friend Carole to help her investigate.  She feels he was murdered. <br /> <br />Jude and Carole are constantly stymied by people giving them information on their whereabouts the night he died, and especially as the stories change to hide the truth.  Suzy is concerned about the reputation of the hotel and refuses to cooperate with Jude. <br /> <br />At times I found it tough to keep up with all the characters in this book.  I also found the differences of how we speak and write in America versus England difficult.   <br /> <br />I like the way Jude and Carole work together in this series.  I recommend this book to those that like mysteries set in England. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-11

An added benefit is that she will get to spend time with Scotland Yard inspector George Sutherland, who is in town for a conference. <br /> <br />At an extravagant party at the Virginia home of Maine's junior senator Warren Nebel, she and George descend some dark, rickety stairs to the dock and find the body of his chief of staff Nikki Farlow.  At first the police think it was an accident; that she tumbled down the stairs.  Neither Jessica nor George buy that.  With further investigation, the police determine that it was murder. <br /> <br />Detective Moody from the Fairfax County Police Department realizes what a resource he has in Jessica.  He asks her for her help.  She enlists George to assist as well, not always to the pleasure of Detective Moody. <br /> <br />Senator Nebel's wife, Pat, who is Jessica's friend, has been ill.  He requests that Jessica spend some time with her during the week.  With all the investigation, spending time with Pat and spending time with George, she doesn't get to participate much in the literacy drive she came to town for. <br /> <br />There are many rumors that Senator Nebel and Nikki had had an affair.  His wife Pat even believes this.  Could he have killed her?  If so, why now? <br /> <br />As she begins to delve deeper into Nikki's death, she become privy to some information that was not released.  Could this prove that the Senator had nothing to do with her murder? <br /> <br />I always enjoy books in this series.  Since I've watched it on t.v. for so many years, I can see Jessica and the other main characters doing the activities I read about.  It is a great cozy series and is always an easy read.  This book being set in the D.C. area made it even more enjoyable for me, since I live in the area.  I highly recommend this book. <br />	2004-10-11

So, they need to investigate without anyone leaving.  Luckily there is a blizzard going on outside and they can use that as the excuse no one can leave. <br /> <br />Usually her books have some recipes, but this time there are over 25 recipes in the back of the book.

With the help of Norman, her other \\"sometime\\" boyfriend, they begin to put the pieces together. <br /> <br />The setting for this series is Minnesota.

He is producing a pilot for a reality TV show featuring three married couples.  They have all had some problems in their marriages but say they want to make it work.  They are vying for a chance to renew their vows in a wedding-cake-shaped hot air balloon and win one million dollars.  Apparently things haven't been going very smooth.  Many things have happened and he wants Regan to come help him keep any more things from going wrong. <br /> <br />He is in competition with Bubbles who is producing a pilot for a comedy TV show.  Unbeknownst to him, she has been having trouble with her actors and things haven't gone smoothly for them either. <br /> <br />Many things continue to happen including Danny's parents arriving only to lose a bag of mail for advice columnists helping on his show.  Worse than that, his mother read one of the letters and if the advice columnists don't pay overdue alimony, his pilot might not be finished in time.  Since his parents helped cause some of this trouble, they find themselves in deep to help resolve it. <br /> <br />Regan begins to question whether all of the married couples are truly who they say they are.  Then there's Roscoe, the man behind the contest of the two pilot shows.  He is a real character and Regan doesn't really trust him.  She has her boyfriend, Jack who is a New York Detective, checking into their backgrounds. <br /> <br />While I liked this book, first one I've read by this author, it was definitely not your normal mystery.  There wasn't any murder.   There was some investigation into the various characters, but not the normal investigation to solve a crime or murder.   <br /> <br />I found this book to be an easy read and enjoyed the story line as it was different than anything else I have read.  Even with many characters, I felt the author did a good job of describing them so that I was able to keep everyone straight.  I recommend this book. <br />	2004-10-11

I really like Bay.  She is a believable protagonist.  The relationships between characters are very well written, too. <br /> <br />I love books set in the south.  Set in South Carolina, this book is steeped in the south.  Bay's knowledge of the area and people really comes to play in the solving of this mystery. <br /> <br />This series is definitely a new favorite of mine.  I highly recommend this book! <br />	2004-08-25

Lee has confessed to murdering her husband Kemper.  She doesn't want Sarah to find a way to get her off, she just wants her to dig up dirt on her husband proving that he got what he deserved.  She also wants Sarah to take care of her teenage daughter, Kip.  What Sarah doesn't know is Kip is a real handful! <br /> <br />Sarah feels that Lee is covering for someone, but she isn't sure who - Kip, Avenger, Bud (the trainer), or someone else.  She knows that if it turns out to be Kip, nothing she could do would make Lee admit it.  So, Sarah begins investigating with the help of her friends Tinkie and Cece.   <br /> <br />Plus, once Kip moves in, all sorts of things start happening.  Sarah is unmarried and thirty.  One night Kip overhears Sarah talking to herself (or so she thinks) about this.  Then men start appearing at the door to escort Sarah to the ball.  This is just the beginning of trouble. <br /> <br />What Kip doesn't know is that Sarah was talking to her great-great-grandmother's nanny's busybody ghost Jitty.  Jitty helps Sarah talk over the case throughout the book. <br /> <br />At the ball, the barn where Avenger, Kip's horse, is burns down.  Everyone saw Avenger, Kip and Bud in the fire.  No one saw them come out.  Sarah doesn't know how she can face Lee with this terrible news. <br /> <br />While I had a little trouble with the ghost, I really enjoyed this book.  The story moves at a good pace and the characters work well together.  The many references to daddy's girls gave credence to it.  I love books set in the south, so Zinnia, Mississippi added a lot to this book. <br /> <br />I recommend this book.  I hope to read more in this series myself. <br />	2004-08-25

Judith is pretty much bed-bound, so Renie ends up doing a lot of the leg work.  Most of the staff won't talk, but they do find a few who will give them a little information.  But then most of them mysteriously go on vacation or are transferred. <br /> <br />Plus Renie is not the best patient.  She is constantly finding a way to order in better food.  Their neighbor across the hall, assists in this activity on a few occasions.  Then a snow storm brings the town to an almost standstill.

A few minutes later Renie observes him being hit by a car in the hospital parking lot. <br /> <br />They know someone is up to no good and hope that they can survive while working to uncover everything! <br /> <br />I love this series.  These cousins always make me laugh.  They get into some of the wildest situations!  Judith's husband and her mother are not as prominent in this book.  They really add to this series as well.  I like how the author can weave the various characters in and out depending on the setting.  They still play a part, but maybe not as big. <br /> <br />The author has a real winner!  If you are looking for a cozy that you can fly through and enjoy, you've found it! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book and the entire series! <br />	2004-08-02

I hate the way her co-workers and boss treat her, but then I just remember that it is the 1950s.  <br />I think this book is written well.  Especially getting that feeling of the 50s across.  I tend to read books set in the now so this is a refreshing change.<br />I highly recommend this book and the previous book, Murderers Prefer Blondes.	2004-07-16

She has her hands full in this book as she is roped into being a chaperone for the church youth group.  They are going to Camp Pearly Gates to do some volunteer work to built bleachers.  Mrs. Jim Bob Buchanon, the mayor's wife, and Brother Verber, the local preacher, would make it interesting enough, but then she also has the high school shop teacher and ten teens to keep in line.  <br />When the body of a white-robed woman turns up on the campgrounds, life gets even more complicated for Arly.  Then there's the man she found fishing on the campgrounds.  Not to mention all the reported sightings of ghosts.  Once her mother Ruby Bee and her best friend Estelle show up, things get even more interesting.<br />Ruby Bee runs Ruby Bee's Bar &amp; Grill.  Due to a recent fire in the kitchen, she is out of business for a couple weeks.  So she brings all her food up to the camp to feed the kids.

It is told from multiple points of view, which at first I found difficult to follow.  Once I got to know the various characters, I found that this story couldn't be told from one point of view.  It is very well written!  <br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-07-16

It's not the documentary that has everyone stirred up, though, it's the story that a Confederate soldier hid two saddlebags of gold up in Cotter's Ridge outside of Maggody back in 1863.  No one had ever heard this story before.  Could the gold still be there?<br />Most everyone begins hunting for the gold.  Cotter's Ridge has never had so many people on it at one time.<br />Outsiders have been arriving in Maggody early for the filming - actors, authors, a filmmaker, and reenactors.  Mrs. Jim Bob Buchanon, the Mayor's wife, is beside herself trying to be the perfect hostess for those staying at her house.  Then the genealogist of the Stump County Historical Society dies under questionable circumstances.  Police Chief Arly Hanks begins investigating.  It amazes her that with as many people as were on Cotter's Ridge when he fell to his death, no one saw anything.<br />People are missing as well.  None of them are totally suspicious disappearances, but yet Arly must investigate each one.  Are they related?  Where have they gone?<br />When one of the Buchanon clan becomes the victim of a vicious and fatal attack, Arly must tackle a very perplexing case.  Could the same person have killed them both?  Why?  Who?<br />The many characters of Maggody really add to this story.  I really enjoy this series.  Ms. Hess has really captured the essence of the Ozarks and the people.<br />Ruby Bee, Arly's mom, is a great character and really adds to the story.  She is always getting on Arly.

She continues investigating and observing the various couples involved.  She feels one of them will lead her to the killer.  Can she stay out of harms way in the process?<br />Hannah is a great character.  I love this series.  It is so different.  Even though I don't dive, I found it very interesting.   It is such a well written book that you don't feel like she's giving you diving lessons throughout the books.  So many authors try to teach how to do something within their book.  She gave great tips throughout, but I found the mystery to be the most important part of the book.  A refreshing change.  The romance that is heating up between Hannah and Peter is terrific, too.  <br />I highly recommend this book and the first one in this series - Swimming With The Dead.	2004-07-16

Usually I don't like stories set back in time, but this one is a great exception.  The characters and setting are so well written.  I found it difficult to put the book down.  I wanted to find out who did it and why.  It is a very well written story with enough twists and turns that you don't figure it out ahead of time.<br />I highly recommend this book and look forward to more in this series!	2004-06-23

It is a quick read.  Very enjoyable!<br />Desiree Shapiro is a private investigator in New York City.  She is not your stereotypical P.I.  She is five-two and considers her best feature to be her glorious hennaed hair.  <br />Teenager Vicky Pirrelli comes to Desiree's office to ask for her help.  Her dad, Victor, was convicted of killing his mistress, Christina.  Recently he told Vicky that he didn't do it.  She wants Desiree to help clear her dad's name.  The kicker is that the crime happened ten years ago and her dad died two weeks ago in prison.  Vicky's only source of income is babysitting and working a few days a week at Frank `n' Burgers, but Desiree agrees to help her anyway.<br />When she begins investigating, she quickly determines there are four suspects, including Vicky's own mother.    Victor's lawyer Blossom Goody is still around and is able to give Desiree some information for her case.  Tony, Victor's brother and now Vicky's stepfather, is tough to pin down.  When Desiree does finally meet with him, he isn't much help.  Desiree has her work cut out for her.  Then some strange things happen that scare Desiree.  Can she find Christina's murder and clear Victor's name without putting herself in more danger?<br />Her personal life isn't going real well either.  Nick's nine year old son, Derek, is not too happy his dad is dating Desiree and lets her know it.  Will Derek turn Nick off to her?<br />This series is always so much fun.  I like Desiree.  She is the kind of P.I. I'd want to hire if I had to.  I feel like she would be on your side pulling for you.  She is also very competent and gets to the bottom of things.  New York is a great setting for a P.I. novel.  <br />There's even a recipe at the back of the book!  I highly recommend this book.	2004-06-23

She is also a member of the Dive and Recovery Team for the Denver Homicide team.  <br />The Denver police commissioner's son, Michael Duvall, was found pinned inside a submerged wreckage of a cargo ship in the British Virgin Islands.  He had been living down there and was an expert diver and researcher.    Hannah is sent down to investigate.  When she first arrives, Chief Dunn was not too receptive.  He didn't like her coming in to look over his shoulder and re-investigate Michael's death.<br />Slowly she is able to gain some people's respect, including Chief Dunn, and helps them get to the bottom of his death - proving it was murder and not an accident.  During this time, though, Hannah finds herself in many dangerous situations, above and below the water.  At first, everyone thinks they are accidents.  Hannah believes they are related to Michael's death and someone not wanting the truth to be known.  Eventually Chief Dunn begins to believe this to be true too.<br />I really enjoyed this book.  It is so different from any other mysteries I've read.  I am not a diver, but I found the diving portions to be so well written, I enjoyed them.  I felt like I was down there with Hannah and seeing everything she saw.  It was fabulous!<br />Hannah is a very likable character.  She is a loner and thinks she wants to stay that way until she meets Peter O'Brien.  He is a suspect and she has a real struggle because she is so attracted to him.  This relationship really adds to the storyline.<br />I think Kathy has a real winning series!  I have also read Dark Water Dive, the second book in the series, and loved it.

First is a note about a young man who died after being lost in the woods in Connecticut.  The second is an obituary about a wealthy man that committed suicide.  Chris' aunt has never mentioned either of these, so she tries to contact the remaining family of each to find out how her aunt was tied to these people.  Turns out the young man was a dear friend of her cousin.   Both of these deaths occurred about twelve years ago.<br />In the investigation, Chris finds that the victims, though they didn't know each other, were wearing each other's shoes.

Most of the men at the magazine expect her to make the coffee.  One day when she calls in sick and the coffee doesn't get made (well, duh, she's not there!), they don't know what to do.  Paige takes a lot of ribbing from her co-workers about her name.  She is looking for that one story that she can investigate and write, hoping that it will be published in the magazine.<br />One day while she is clipping articles from the local papers for her boss, she spies a story that grabs her interest.  She recognizes the picture of Babs Comstock, but not the name, on a story.  Babs was strangled with a Hopalong Cassidy jump rope.  Babs had had high hopes for the big screen.  She had been trying to get modeling jobs, thus her picture had come across Paige's desk some time ago.<br />Paige decides to begin looking into Babs' life and try to determine who could have killed her and why.<br />She interacts with Detective Dan Street who is running the investigation.  She is surprised to find she is very attracted to him.  Paige is a widow.  He is divorced.  Her friend Abby keeps encouraging her, but Paige is quite leery.<br />Paige soon finds that Babs (really Wanda Wingate) was involved in some unsavory activities.  Paige also finds herself in some dangerous situations.  She ends up on the roof of her building, with very little clothing on, hiding out during one of those situations.<br />This is such a terrific book.  It is the first I have ever read by this author, but it won't be the last!  I can't wait to read the second book in this series.  <br />Paige and Abby are great friends.  They are very well written characters and interact wonderfully.  The author has really captured the time period as well.  I found it difficult seeing Paige treated so terribly at work, but then I had to keep reminding myself that's what it was like back then.<br />The story moves along at a fairly good pace and the setting is described very well.  I found the mystery to have plenty of red-herrings so that I had trouble figuring out who did it.  That's the way I like it.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-05-20

She doesn't know how they will sell them until they open and are mobbed once again.<br />Then the State Police determine he was killed and arrest Brennan's daughter, Diedre.  She and her husband Kenneth had arrived with Brennan and Shelby Cabot from the publisher's the night of Brennan's talk.  <br />About 50 years ago P.I. Jack Shepard had been shot in a bookstore in this same location.  Apparently Brennan's Jack Shield character was built off of Jack Shepard.  <br />Penelope starts conversing with Jack Shepard in her head.  Most of the time she is trying to stop hearing him, but he is very persistent.<br />I like the interaction of Penelope and Jack, even though he's a ghost.  This is such a well-written cozy.  She has created likeable characters, including a ghost, but it isn't scary in the least.  Matter of fact, I found it funny!<br />The interaction between the other characters is well written as well.  I also like the setting of a small Rhode Island town.  The bookstore setting gives it charm.<br />She has a real winner!  I highly recommend this!  You won't want to put it down.	2004-04-14

He has come asking for a part of her liver.  He is a recovering alcoholic in need of a liver transplant.  Due to his alcoholism, he can't be moved up in the list if his need becomes greater.  He has heard that a relative can give him a portion of their liver and that portion will regenerate in the donor and the portion given will grow into a full liver for him.<br />Chris is not sure what she thinks of her father's return, but she knows she can't give him a portion of her liver.  Instead she is able to get him into a new program that will transplant a genetically altered pig's liver into a human.<br />The transplant goes very well.  Then Wayne has a fever.  There are so many precautions taken to prevent from infecting Wayne or anyone else, but still they keep a close eye on him.  He gets well quickly and they figure all is well.  Matter of fact, things seem to be going extremely well, better than expected.<br />When some nurses that took care of him die, they start looking into whether this could be related to the transplant.  Then some more people die.  They can't figure out how these people tie back to the transplant.<br />Chris feels responsible and works hard at investigating the various deaths, including looking into where their lives might have intersected.<br />The pace in this book is great.  It keeps you wondering what will happen next.  I found it difficult to put down.  <br />The characters interact well and there is enough uncertainty that you can't easily figure out too soon what is going on.  It is very well written.  <br />I recommend this book.	2004-04-14

Louisa May Alcott is 22.  Yes, this is the Louisa who later writes Little Women and goes on to become a famous author.  In this book she does the sleuthing.  <br />Her friend Dorothy Brownly Wortham is recently returned from her travels in Europe after her wedding to Preston.  Louisa and her friend Sylvia Shattuck have been invited to Dorothy's for tea.  Also in attendance are Dorothy's twin sisters Edith and Sarah, their brother Edgar, and their aunt Alfreda Thorney.  Unfortunately the one person missing is Dorothy.  After waiting for quite a while, she arrives.  She says that tea was for tomorrow, not today.  She won't say where she's been.  She seems quite distraught and asks everyone to come back tomorrow for tea.  She asks Louisa to arrive a little early so that they may talk.<br />Louisa is distressed and determined to arrive early to find out what is wrong with Dorothy.<br />The next day, Dorothy is once again missing.  After everyone arrives, Constable Cobban of the Boston Watch and Police arrives to announce that Dorothy had drowned.  Her dog Lily was found drowned with her.<br />Louisa and Sylvia attend the autopsy but it proves to be too much for Sylvia and they leave.  Louisa is determined to find out how and why Dorothy was murdered.  Yes, it was murder.  <br />Louisa ends up putting herself in danger and bringing gossip upon her name in her quest to find the murderer.<br />While historical mysteries are not my favorite, I really enjoyed this book.  It was fun having a famous author do the sleuthing.  I thought I was well written and the characters were so well developed that I had trouble figuring out who did it.  That always makes it a good mystery in my eyes.<br />I look forward to reading more books with Louisa doing the sleuthing.  I recommend this book.	2004-04-09

The job description said she'd give lessons, schmooze with the members about the professional golf circuit and help out in the pro shop - in emergencies only.    She'd hit some rough patches in the LPGA tour and her friend Laura had heard about this opening and pressed her to apply.<br />When Cassie arrives, she meets Scott Mallory, the club's pro and Richie, the assistant pro.  She also meets Elizabeth Weigel, the president of the ladies' group.  Cassie is asked to go to the board of directors meeting that night as Scott and Rich are committed to a Connecticut PGA Section dinner.  Then she meets her suite mate, Megan Donovann<br />At the meeting, she meets many people.  Brad Latham presents a proposal to pursue Audubon Sanctuary Certification at the club.  This is not met with much agreement by the board.  Then Elizabeth Weigel speaks to suggest the board revisit the club's policies regarding gender equality.  None of the board is very supportive of her suggestions either.<br />The next day was the ladies' member-guest tournament.  Cassie was stationed on the seventh tee.  If  a participant's tee shot reached the green, Cassie was to use their club to try to hit her own ball closer to the hole.  If she couldn't do it, they got a sleeve of Lady Precept balls (hottest ball on tour).  By mid afternoon, Cassie found herself still stuck at the seventh tee and she had an urgent need to pee.  One foursome told her the next one had fallen a hole behind so she went behind some tall reeds to relieve herself.  Then she discovers Brad Latham tangled in the underbrush.  He was bloody.  He had been beaten.  He later dies on the way to the hospital.<br />Cassie wonders who would want him dead.  True no one was supportive of his proposal at the board meeting, but could someone have killed him for that?<br />Many things start to happen.  Then there is another death, this time of someone Cassie has gotten to know.  She begins to really look into the members and who would have wanted these two people dead.  She ends up putting herself and others in danger.<br />I am not a golf fan, but I loved this book.  Cassie is a great character.  She has a lot of spunk but yet she has weaknesses too.  The many additional characters in this book are all well written and really add to the story.  The setting is great too.  Having so many different types of people coming together in the club setting, and have the controversies they do, make it hard to know who could have done it.<br />I look forward to reading more of her exploits in future books.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-04-09

He even complains that Prozac is too loud!<br />Howard Murdoch hires her to write a love letter to Stacy Lawrence, the aerobics instructor at his gym.  Much to Jaine's surprise, Stacy agrees to go out with Howard.<br />Then Stacy is found dead, bludgeoned to death with a Thigh-Master.  Howard is arrested, but he says he didn't do it.  Detective Rea feels they have the right person in jail.  Jaine decides to look into it.  She feels responsible because, if she hadn't written the letter, Stacy wouldn't have agreed to go out with him and Howard would be arrested.<br />In the course of her investigation, Jaine meets Cameron Bannick, a major hunk, who knew Stacy but had an iron clad alibi.  She is very happy about this when they start dating.  She can't believe her luck.<br />Jaine uncovers quite a few people who weren't too sad that Stacy was dead.  Some even had possible motives to kill her.  In the course of her investigation, the killer begins to catch on and in the end, Jaine finds herself in a lot of danger.<br />I truly enjoyed this book.  Jaine is such a likeable character.  She is very much a three-dimensional character.<br />The additional characters in the book are all well written and the plot is well crafted.

Jaine wrote a segment called \\"Cinderella Muffy.\\"  The head writers Stan and Audrey Miller had liked it.  So, here she was.  Miracle Studios wasn't one of the more glamorous studios and the office she shared with Kandi  was a closet-sized room.  The window overlooked the transvestites on Santa Monica Boulevard.  <br />The star of Muffy `n Me is Vanessa Dennis.  She is a lovely teenager, but Jaine soon found out that her personality was not so lovely.  <br />One day on the set they accidentally walk in on actor Quinn Kirkland and Vanessa Duffy \\"boffing like crazed rabbits.\\"  <br />Later when Quinn dies, Kandi is considered to be the police's top suspect because she handed the donuts to him that were poisoned.  No one else seemed to have had access to the donuts to put the poison on them.<br />Jaine begins to investigate because she believes her friend is innocent.  In her investigation she discovers that there weren't many people on the set that wouldn't have wished Quinn dead, even Kandi.  <br />Jaine is also getting emails from her parents.  Her dad thinks her mom is having an affair.  Jaine tries to help them figure thing out, but it is difficult.  This does distract her from her investigation at times. <br />Before Jaine can prove who killed Quinn, she makes some enemies and puts herself in danger.<br />I think this is a fabulous book and series.  The characters were so much fun.  Having them all work on a low-level comedy helped keep the characters together and easier for Jaine to investigate.<br />I highly recommend this book.

At first Jason doesn't believe her, but then he hears the message too.  <br />Since Jason is tied up in his conference, Carolyn goes to visit her.  Vera Blue, her mother-in-law, tells her not to investigate.  She says the police will figure out their mistake.  Once Carolyn meets with Vera's lawyer Margaret Hanrahan and Inspector Harry Yu, she realizes she'd better start looking into things because no one else is.  The police feel they have the murderer.  <br />Carolyn and Jason move over to Vera's sublet so that it will be easier for Vera to get messages to them.  In the process, Carolyn meets Bruno Valetti who lives on the second floor.

Sam and Carolyn do a lot of the detecting together.  There are so many potential suspects.  They quite often end up in seedy locations.  Plus Jason is not too excited to find out they have been riding on Sam's motorcycle.<br />This was the first book I've read in this series.  I like Carolyn a lot.  This was a very enjoyable story.  I thought she blended some great characters together and I found the story to be quite believable.<br />My only frustration was with the fact that a chapter can be written from a different character's perspective.  She lists at the beginning of each chapter who is speaking, but I read in small bursts and found myself forgetting who was talking.  I can see in other books (I've since read another in this series) this really helps the story.  I just didn't find itas helpful in this one.  <br />I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more in this series.	2004-02-15

Holly McDougal had been strangled on the MGM lot. <br />Elvis went to the California Correction Institution in Tehachapi to see Squirm.  He met Bob Reardon, warden of CCI.  After his discussion with Squirm, the warden gave Elvis a script.  In a recent interview Elvis had asked for a first-class script. <br />Then Elvis contacted Regis Clifford, Squirm's lawyer.  Elvis quickly concluded that Regis was a drinker.  He discussed Squirm's case.  He found out that a makeup artist named Connie Spinelli had told Regis that Holly McDougal was a wild kid.  She said that she `made a stripper blush to her ankles.'   Unfortunately when Regis went to meet with Spinelli, she had vanished.  <br />He also told Elvis that Miss Nanette Poulette, Squirm's girlfriend, had given some damning testimony against him which seemed to seal his fate.<br />Elvis asked around about Spinelli and finally got someone to talk to him.  He then called his buddy Billy Jackson and asked for his help in contacting her.<br />Elvis went to the stunt shack on the MGM lot.  He met Will Cathcart, a stuntman and rodeo rider.  He showed Elvis around including the bunk room where Holly had died.  Will had not been around then.  He also gave Elvis a trial ride on Nelly, the stuntman's mistrees, a harness.  While dangling from the harness, he met Mickey Grieves, Squirem's good buddy who had referred Squirm to his attorney.  <br />I won't tell you anymore.  You'll have to read to find out how Elvis keeps digging and digging to find out the truth behind the strangling of Holly McDougal.  So many times I had to remind myself that Elvis never did all this investigation.  It is written so well and with such believability and history interwoven, that I often forget it's fiction.<br />Mr. Klein has done a great job in catching the true essence of Elvis and using it in his books.  <br />I highly recommend this book and the whole series.	2004-01-28

Turing was programmed by Zack Malone.  She is sentient.  <br />She begins worrying when Zack does not come to work for a few days.  There is no record of his planning to be absent.  Turing observes James Smith (is that his real name?) from security searching Zack's office.  She then enlists Tim Pincoski who works in the copying room and Maude Graham, a secretary, to help her find Zack.  Turing is able to view the goings on at UL via the various security cameras but soon realizes she cannot see any cameras on the ninth floor where security resides.<br />At first Tim insists Turing is a real woman who refuses to meet him in person.  Over time, he begins to understand that she really is a sentient computer.<br />Tim ends up on the run from security.  Maude and Tim put themselves in continuous danger to help Turing in her quest to find Zack.<br />I found this to be a refreshingly new protagonist for a cozy mystery.  Many times I almost forgot that Turing was a computer.  She is so realistically written but yet has the limitations of a computer.  It is those limitations that brought back the fact that she was a computer.  The way she interacts with Tim and Maude in their search and the way she has to be careful who is listening or watching are so realistic.<br />Tim is a great character and I hope that he and Maude will be in future books in this series.  I like the Crystal City location as I have been there and recognized many of the locations mentioned in the book.<br />I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading the next book in the series.	2004-01-04

Much to the chagrin of Sheriff Flynn.  They had run ins on a previous murder investigation.  Of course, it probably didn't help that Jack had solved that one instead of the sheriff.<br />A boxer, Roark, was found inside the car with the judge.  As yet no one has been able to get to the body because Roark was attacking them.  Jack, using his alternative dog training methods, coaxed Roark out of the car with a tennis ball.<br />The police believe that Roark killed the judge.

Eventually Farrell Woods came by and Jack was able to get some much needed information about some things going on in town recently.<br />Jamie and Jack keep digging and the identity of the real killer and the truth about what happened begin to come clearer.<br />I truly enjoy this series.

Her best friend, Miriam, is dating Melibee Elphinstone.  Belle doesn't know much about him.  Miriam talks Belle into joining them for dinner at Mel's.  Then Miriam finds Mel dead.  She calls Belle, who rushes over.  Unfortunately Miriam touched the Inuit sculpture that turns out to be the murder weapon.  Belle calls her friend Steve, a police detective, over.  Since Miriam has gone into shock, instead of arresting her, she is placed in a sanitarium to recuperate.  <br />Belle takes in Miriam's apricot mini-poodle, Strudel, until Miriam comes home and can take care of him herself.  Her own dog, Freya, a shepherd, enjoys having a companion to play with.<br />Belle discovers that Mel had invested many women's money and most of them had lost their life savings.  Knowing that Miriam too had invested money, she got Jesse, another dear friend, to arrange for a lawyer for Miriam.  But, Belle wasn't sure that young Celeste could handle a murder trial if things should come to that.  Then Steve is unavailable because he is under suspicion of taking bribes in drug investigations.<br />Belle is outraged.  She thinks Brian, another detective, is behind these outlandish charges against Steve.  Belle had scorned Brian's amorous attempts.  So, Belle begins investigating on her own.  Belle meets Dorothy Grasslin at the sanitarium.  She is a volunteer who comes to chat with the patients.  Dorothy's late husband was a P.I. so she asks to help Belle investigate Mel's death.  Miriam's ex-husband Jack comes back to town to help with the investigation as well.  <br />The only thing I had some trouble with was the terminology.  It reminded me of some of the British mysteries.  I could usually figure out what was meant, but I didn't exactly know what they meant.<br />The other thing that I found to get a little old, was Belle's referencing most things to an old movie she'd seen.  I hadn't seen many of them so the references didn't mean much to me.<br />They get into many predicaments in their investigation.  I like the various characters she has created.  Belle is very believable and likeable.  This being the first book I've read in this series, I only had the descriptions from this book to base my information on.  Jack was well described and I thought he fit into the story well.  I also like Jesse a lot.<br />I recommend this book and look forward to reading others in this series.	2003-12-21

Mark, the manager and overseer of the Outlook, the upscale gallery for her show, introduces her to Henry Duran who is interested in her sculptures.  But, he wants something with a little more edge to it.  She takes him into the studio in back to show him one of her sculptures that didn't make it into the show.  She feels it might be just what he is looking for.  On their way back there, she smells something burning.  Without thinking, she opens the peephole on the kiln in the firing room and finds a man curled up in the kiln, dead.<br />Maggie's boyfriend, Detective Sam Villari, is in charge of the investigation.  While he is working, she is questioned by another detective. <br />Maggie and Villari have a very volatile relationship.  He loves her and readily admits it.  Maggie isn't sure what she feels and definitely can't voice it.<br />Mark and his wife Jamie seem to be having trouble.  Mark says Jamie is distant and won't talk to him.  Maggie has spoken to Jamie about it, and she says work is just busy.  Maggie does not believe this to be what is causing their trouble, but she isn't certain what is.   Then Maggie follows Jamie when she gets into a black car with another man.  Unfortunately Maggie's car is not very good.  She ends up losing them.<br />She, Duran and Maggie's friend Lisa begin investigating.  They are looking into various leads to determine who killed Jeff Riley and why.  They find themselves in some very interesting predicaments and often in danger.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Maggie Kean is the girl next door, but she has her own baggage as well.  Her relationship with Villari is on again, off again.  You never really know what's up.  Her car really adds to the story as well.  Her friend Lisa is terrific and sticks with her through thick and thin.  Duran is a character in and of himself.  He is so well written and described.  I wonder if he'll be in future books.<br />I am not an art fan, but this was such an enjoyable read, that I never really thought about it.  I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more!	2003-12-10

Cliff and Ned Stevenson make his life difficult at every turn.  Jake Harvey, Janelle's father, is constantly in his face about this case as well.  Then there's Janelle's aunt Dorothy and cousin Tommy.  <br />As Frank interviews Janelle's friends, she starts to see a different Janelle than the one painted by her father.  He tries to follow each lead.  He steps on many toes in the process. <br />Frank works closely with the State police.  He also works with his assistant Earl, but is afraid to put Earl in charge of much.<br />Many pets are being killed.  Frank feels there is a connection but can't tie them together.  Everyone thinks he is wasting his time.  <br />The ransom note arrives and causes more controversy.  Then other things begin happening.  Frank is running out of time but has so many leads to follow he is afraid he is wasting his time.<br />Trout Run is definitely a small town with a close knit community.  No one wants to admit that something this terrible could happen there.  Especially if one of them is involved.<br />I really enjoyed this book.  The author starts right out with her disappearance and pulled me right into the story with this.<br />I thought Frank was a well-rounded character.  He related well with the townspeople but yet didn't let them intimidate him.  He still investigated them.<br />The fact that no one was very forthcoming with information was also very indicative of a small town.<br />I highly recommend this book and lookforward to reading more in this series.	2003-12-10

He goes to Prague because his Czech cousin Anna and her husband Vlasta aren't answering their phone.  Vlasta is to come to Philadelphia for heart surgery soon.  <br />When he arrives, he finds their nine-year-old daughter Marie hiding in the giant oven in their apartment.  She tells him that two men with guns came and took her parents away.  He then smuggles Marie off to Philadephia.  His secretary, Mrs. Doyle, is to care for her with the help of Dr. Fenimore's girlfriend Jennifer and Horatio, his teenage office helper also known as `Rat'.  <br />He then goes to the University where his cousins teach to try to contact some of their colleagues.  Unfortunately the college is on break and there aren't many people there.  He meets Ilsa.  She gives him a tour of the city and ends up taking him to a puppet show.  He meets Redik, the puppet master and a colleague of his cousin's.  She also takes him to St. Wenceslas Chapel.  They see a sign announcing that the Crown Jewels will be on display there the next day.  <br />Dr. Fenimore has many adventures in Prague.  He and eventually Jennifer, when she comes to Prague, are brought more deeply into the center of things.  They both find themselves in danger while trying to untangle the web and find his cousins.<br />This is the first I have read in this series.  It won't be the last.  I cannot wait to read the next one.  Dr. Fenimore is such a great character.  He is so simple, but yet very intelligent.  You can believe that he doesn't have a cell phone or use email regularly.  He is the kind of doctor I'd like to find.  All of the other characters are so wonderfully created as well.  <br />The scenery of Prague was very interesting.  I don't know much about it so I enjoyed learning.  <br />Plus I got to meet author Robin Hathaway and that was an added bonus. <br />I highly recommend this book.  I also have readher new book Scarecrow in her new series.  Please read my review on that book as well.	2003-12-10

Due to her troubled past, she has left that work to become the Director of the newly renovated River Trail Museum of National History in Georgia.  The museum is to open to the public in a few weeks. <br />Atlanta Detective Frank Duncan, her former lover, calls and asks her to examine a bone found in the woods.  His friends, George and Louise, found a bone in the woods near their daughter Star's boyfriend's house.  Star and the boyfriend are missing.  They are worried it is her.<br />Diane had promised herself that she would never examine bones again.  But, since they are friends of Frank's, she does.  She determines that the person was male.  <br />The museum has their opening party for contributors, board members, and invited guests.  It is a hit.  Frank gets called away because George, Louise, and their fourteen year old son Jay have been shot dead.  The police believe Star did this.  Frank does not and begins trying to prove that she didn't.  <br />Many unusual things begin occurring at the museum.  They all appear to be an attempt to discredit Diane so that she would be unseated and the museum could be sold and relocated.  She doesn't know why board member Mark Grayson is pushing so hard to relocate the museum when it has just been renovated.<br />This is a terrific series.  I have always liked her Lindsay Chamberlain series and I feel this is another winner!  She goes into great detail with the forensic examinations, but never did I feel her descriptions were too graphic or gory.  This made it much more enjoyable for me.  Many of the forensic mysteries go too far.<br />Diane is a well-crafted character and you don't find out too soon what she's all about.  It is all laid out with perfect timing.  I cannot wait to read the next book in this series.  I also feel that the setting of the museum was a great idea.  Lends itself to many interesting situations and many wonderful characters.  I highly recommend this book.	2003-12-10

One day he comes upon a mob throwing things at a home in Hanover Square.  Since Hanover Square is one of the wealthier neighborhoods of London, a riot is one of the last things he would expect to find there.  A young officer shoots Mr. Thornton, the leader of the mob.  Captain Lacey comes to his rescue and helps Mr. and Mrs. Thornton get home.<br />Mr. Thornton's maid, Alice, tells Captain Lacey that Mr. Horne lives in the house in Hanover Square.  She also tells him that Mr. Thornton believes Mr. Horne kidnapped his daughter, Jane, and her maid, Aimee, from their carriage.  They are still missing.<br />Captain Lacey finds that Mr. Horne is associated with Mr. Denis -- not someone to get tangled up with.  Mr. Grenville, Captain Lacey's friend, assists him in looking for Jane, but discourages him from interacting directly with Mr. Denis.<br />Then Mr. Horne is found dead in his study.  Aimee is found bound and drugged in a wardrobe just feet away from where Mr. Horne was killed, but Jane is nowhere to be found. <br />As Captain Lacey and Mr. Grenville continue investigating to find Jane, they are told of another girl's disappearance.  They end up putting themselves in great danger to locate Jane. <br />The only thing I had trouble with was the setting -- London in 1816.  I rarely read books set back that far in time, but I actually enjoyed this book.  Captain Lacey is a very likeable fellow.  His past has caused him much pain and he is trying to survive in a very tough world.<br />I found the other characters, although some of them were less reputable, to be very well constructed.  From her descriptions, I got a real sense of London in the 1800's.  <br />I recommend this book.	2003-12-10

Cecily owned it and Hugh ran it before they were married.  It seems Edward's current manager has fallen down a well and Edward is out of the country on business.  <br />The authorities believe Barry Wortham's death is an accident.  Cecily wonders otherwise, especially once they arrive at the Pennyfoot.  All the staff is talking about how they don't believe it was an accident.  Then Mrs. Wrotham asks Cecily to look into Barry's death.<br />Cecily invites her friends and former employees, Mrs. Chubb and Gertie as well as their families, to come and join them for the holidays.  She also sets out to have a pantomime prepared for the holidays by her friend Phoebe and her dance troupe.  This usually spells disaster.  Her friend, Madeline, will help decorate the Pennyfoot for the Christmas holidays.<br />Many things happen to Cecily while she is investigating.  Hugh is quite perturbed, because he explicitly asked her not to do anything without consulting him first.  She keeps forgetting.  <br />Then there's a definite murder.  Cecily steps up her investigating and ends up putting herself in danger as well.<br />The four barristers and their wives staying at the Pennyfoot are real characters and really add to this story.  I like books set in Inns and find it makes it easier to keep everyone together and accounted for.<br />This was the first book I've read in this series, and I can truly say I am looking forward to the next.  Rarely do I like books set back in time, but this series is truly enchanting.  The staff, current and former, are enjoyable characters and really add character.<br />I highly recommend you read this book.	2003-11-26

It is the first mystery I've read that combines murder and figure skating and is very well written. <br />Rebecca &quot;Bex&quot; Levy is a figure-skating researcher for the 24/7 network. It is the World Figure Skating Championships in San Francisco -- the end of her first season. The Russian skater, Xenia Trubin, is awarded the Gold medal and the U. S. skater, Erin Simpson, is awarded the Silver medal. The 24/7 broadcasters, Diana and Francis Howarth, state on the air that they believe Erin skated better and should have been awarded the Gold. They go on to imply that the Italian judge was bribed to vote with the ex-Soviet bloc of judges. Bex is appalled. <br />Then Silvana Potenza, the Italian judge, is found dead. The police believe it was an accident. Bex finds a printout of an email sent to Silvana the morning before the ladies' long program. It lists the ladies' finish order as Xenia first and Erin second. The email was signed Sergei Alemazov, Xenia's coach. <br />Bex finds there are so many suspects and so little time -- she has promised her boss Gil that she'd figure out who killed Silvana before their big show in two days. <br />I am a fan of figure skating, so merging it and murder together truly interested me. I like Bex, she's a very likable character. Her job as a researcher helps her have access to and information about the people involved that most people couldn't find. Ms. Adams has done a great job in creating this character. <br />Bex' boss Gil is a bit over the top, but that's what makes him so great. The Howarth's are very believable and are utilized at the right times in this book. This was a great book in what I hope will be a long series. I can't wait to read the next one. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book.	2003-11-26

She is planning to leave the NYPD soon for a desk job with an insurance company.  <br />Her new partners are Gordon Defino and Sean MacHovec.  It is soon evident that MacHovec prefers to stay in and work the phones.  Defino and Jane do the legwork.  They were to re-investigate the death of Arlen Quill.  Quill had been found stabbed to death in the entry of his apartment building.  <br />When they begin investigating, they find that everyone has moved from the apartment building.  Considering that it is a rent-controlled building, this alone is suspicious.  Then they find out that there were other deaths that in and of themselves were not suspicious but when you put them all together, they were.<br />On top of all this, Jane is going through some changes in her life.  Recently she split up with Hack.  He's married and his daughter was getting suspicious.  And she's moving into a new apartment.  Then the letter arrives and complicates her life even more.<br />She ends up going to Omaha to try to find one of the former tenants who might have much needed information.  From that trip, she is concerned that she was followed.  The case takes on a different tempo.  She ends up putting herself in danger in her attempts to solve it.<br />I really like Jane.  She is a complex character but yet she is human.  New York is always a great setting for a mystery with a detective for the protagonist.  <br />The plot takes many twists and turns before everything is discovered.  It is very well written.<br />I have always enjoyed Lee Harris' other series starring ex-nun Christine Bennett.  The two series are very different and I think that is a good thing.<br />I highly recommend this new series and cannot wait for the next book to be published.	2003-11-21

Her son Toby is coming home for the first time from college for Thanksgiving.  They are awaiting his arrival, she probably more than the others.  It had been hard on her having Toby gone.  <br />She is kept busy with her work as a journalist for the Pennysaver, the weekly newspaper.  She attends the meetings of the Tinker's Cove Board of Selectmen.  Many of the meetings are long and tedious.  That was before the ancestors of the Metinnicut Indians are trying to get the Metinnicut recognized as an official Indian tribe.  At one of the meetings, discussion gets quite heated when discussing their proposed casino.<br />Curt Nolan was a very outspoken advocate of the Metinnicut tribe and the casino.  He ruffled many people with his abrupt ways.  Then he is found dead behind the refreshments stand at the local high school football game on Thanksgiving.<br />Not only did Toby come home for Thanksgiving, but he brought friends.  Friends that were not anticipated by Lucy.  She didn't get to have long talks with Toby as she had hoped.  She barely got to see him, let alone talk to him.  Lucy is having a tough time dealing with this.<br />Then Miss Tilley gets Lucy to agree to look into Curt's death.  She doesn't want to do it because her husband, Bill, had explicity told her not to.  But, Miss Tilley can be quite persuasive.  <br />Lucy also agrees to take Kadjo, Curt Nolan's dog, since he no longer has a home.  She is afraid that Bill will be upset, but he accepts the new dog into the family without any problem.<br />I like this series a lot.  Lucy and her family are your every day average family.  She just ends up involved in investigating murders.  And she always ends up putting herself and sometimes her family or friends in danger.  This book is especially good what with the added stress of Thanksgiving and Toby's return to spice up her life.<br />I always enjoy mysteries set in New England, especially Maine.  The descriptions of the area are very enjoyable and make me feel like I've been there.<br />I highly recommend this book and the whole series.	2003-11-21

Part of the way they have to ride their horses.  They find a large crater.  It appears that a cow exploded and killed a woman and a man.  It turns out to be environmental activist Stewie Woods and his new bride.<br />The cattle belonged to ranch owner Jim Finotta.  When Joe goes to notify him of the death of approximately 10 of his cattle, he notices an elk head on Finotta's wall.  Joe determines that Finotta killed it out of season and left the meat to rot.  He tries everything he can to prosecute Finotta, but he is so well connected that Joe is stopped at every turn.<br />Unbeknownst to Joe, his wife, Marybeth, knew Stewie many years ago.  His death stirs up her memories and puts them in danger as well.<br />Then more environmental activists die in bizarre accidents.  Joe knows something is going on, but can't quite put his finger on it.  More things begin happening, and the next thing he knows, he is being hunted.  Will he ever get home in one piece to his family?<br />I like Joe.  He is a great guy.  He always tries to do what is right.  Quite often that ticks other people off and makes his job harder.<br />This series is a step out of my normal genre.  I usually only read cozy mysteries (little sex, violence and cussing).  This goes over that line, but because I like Joe Pickett and Mr. Box's writing style, I read this series.  I do want to mention that this book is a bit violent and graphic.  I found I had to skip over some of those parts. <br />I recommend this book.  This is one series that you will want to read.  The suspense keeps you guessing and the pace moves quickly.	2003-11-05

I found ex-cop Jack Field to be a very likeable guy.  You can see with his relationship with the dogs as well as humans, that he is very caring, but he is also strong.<br />Jack, his dog, Frankie, and his foster son, Duke, left New York City and started a canine kennel in Maine.  Duke's family had been gunned down and rather than let the gang kill Duke, Jack brought him -- with his grandmother's consent.  The New York District Attorney was a different story.<br />Jamie Cutter is Jack's girlfriend.  She's also a part-time medical examiner.  She brings Jack along when Allison DeMarco is found dead in her home because Allison's dog, Ginger, had been barking and everyone was afraid to go near her.  Jack knows Ginger because he helped train her.  <br />Jack has a run in with Sam Kirby, Rockland County Sheriff Deputy.  Then he meets Sheriff Horace Flynn, uncle to Jamie's soon-to-be ex-husband Oren.  Sheriff Flynn doesn't like Jack, especially after he determines the relationship between Jack and Jamie.<br />Jack ends up bringing Ginger back to his kennel. <br />The local police have decided Tim Berry killed Allison.  Tim and Allison's daughter, Tara, take off in a flurry of bullets.  <br />After Jack gets shot, Mrs. Murtaugh, who helps run the kennel, has her granddaughter Audrey Stafford work at the kennels to help out.

Jamie assists him.<br />Jack can't figure out why Sheriff Flynn is still involved in the case since Carl Staub of the Camden police is in charge of the investigation.  And then there's Sam Kirby.  Jack spies Kirby tailing him, among other things.<br />I highly recommend this book and can't wait to read the next book!	2003-11-03

Assist. at an England auction house and jewel thief	When I picked up this novel to read, I thought I was reading the next segment in her Lilly Bennett series.  I soon realized that it wasn't, but I soon fell in love with Kick Keswick.<br />Kick is the Executive Assistant at Ballantine and Company Auctioneers in England.  But, she is also a jewel thief.  She has learned so much about jewels that she now constructs fakes and expertly slips the real jewels into her pocket and puts the fakes in the Auction company safes.

Sir Cramner Ballantine found her and helped her turn her life around.  She learned everything there was to learn about the items being auctioned.  Before Sir Cramner died, he gave Kick a 15% interest in the company as KDK Trust.  No one else knew about this but his lawyer.<br />Sir Cramner had asked her to keep an eye on his son Sir Benjamin as he took over Ballantine and Company and to not let him run it into the ground.  This task about did Kick in.  Now Ballantine and Company has merged with Brace International.  Owen Brace takes when Sir Benjamin kills himself.  Kick has her work cut out for her to help Owen gain the appearance and respect worthy of Ballantine and Company.<br />The undercurrent of her being a jewel thief working in an upscale business constantly kept this story moving.  I found myself picking this book up to read to find out what happened next.  It isn't your standard mystery by any means, but I truly enjoyed it and look forward to reading about more adventures with Kick.<br />The England scenery and the upper class auction business gave the story a lot of credibility and gave me a look into a lifestyle I am totally unaware of.  I got a good education but in a veryenjoyable manner.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2003-11-03

She fears he may be in danger if the killer thinks he was seen. <br />Mike is assigned the case.  April begins investigating when she is supposed to be recuperating.  Finally Mike tries to let her help.  <br />The killer used martial arts skills.  April had not been able to attempt using hers.  He had taken her by surprise and was very powerful.<br />Then a second victim is struck down in the same place in a similar fashion.  Birdie Bassett had inherited her husband's fortune against his children's wishes.

They also look into his known friends and contacts.  <br />I like April Woo.  She is a fun character with a mother that is a hoot.

These crimes are very believable in this setting.<br />The friction between Mike and April adds to the story and helps us get to know them as a couple, not just individuals.<br />This was a new series to me and I am happy I have gotten to know April Woo.  I look forward to reading the next book.  I highly recommend this book.	2003-11-03

Then people begin dying and things turn toxic.<br />As she begins investigating, she discovers a tangled web tying everyone and everything together.  Now if she can just untangle the web before any more manatees or people die.<br />The only constant characters in this series are Rachel, Jake and Terri, her cross-dressing friend from New Orleans.  But, they aren't in every book.  I think one of the things I like most about this series is the fact that there is a new boss and a landlady/landlord to get to know in each book because she is in a new location.  But she always butts heads with her boss and often her landlady/landlord are older.  She comes up with some of the most unique characters for her books.  <br />You must read this book, I highly recommend it.  I can't wait for the next one.	2003-10-27

His partner, Katja Abdretevsjty, is missing and a suspect in his murder. Dawn Gilpatrick, owner of Stepping Out Dance Studio, is frantic to find Katja. She does not believe Katja had anything to do with Shane's murder. <br />Junie Baker, Dawn's ex-husband and ex-partner, is stealing teacher's from Dawn's studio for his own. His studio is located only 4.8 miles from Dawn's and there is a lot of bad blood between them. He was trying to steal Shane right before his murder. <br />Designer Enrico was to unveil his new collection of ballroom gowns during the competition, but someone got into his studio and slashed all the dresses. <br />Are the murder and dresses related? Who could have done these things? Where is Katja? Lindy's &quot;friend&quot; Bill Brandecker, a professor and former New York detective, has come to spend a few days with Lindy. She still isn't sure what the situation is between her husband Glen and herself. Glen has been in Paris for months and recently said he wasn't coming back. But, he hasn't asked her for a divorce. She is so confused. <br />Rose, a co-worker of Lindy's, is a close friend of Dawn's. Rose persuades Lindy to help Dawn find Katja. Of course, Bill is not happy. He doesn't want Lindy involved in another murder. <br />Ms. Freydont has a real winner with this series. She has created terrific characters and always sets the book in an interesting setting. I enjoyed the ballroom competition as the backdrop in this book. I learned a lot about the competition. All I'd ever known before was what I'd seen on TV. This gave me a lot of background to the competitions. <br />I like the way Lindy and Bill begin to work together at times during this murder investigation. There are plenty of twists andturns and Lindy puts herself and others in danger more than once. <br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book and this series	2003-10-14

It will be an old-fashioned Halloween fair with a bonfire, ghost stories, a haunted hay ride going through the woods and by dilapidated buildings, and a theatrical revue which she is to direct.  It's all to raise money for a teen center.  Everything is being held at the historic VanCleef Farm site.  This is also where the teen center would be housed.  The picketers across the street cause a lot of trouble for the fair.<br />Then Lindy finds what she believes to be a dummy under the bridge.  It turns out to be a dead man.  Unfortunately it gets away because Adam Crabtree, the recluse, nudges it, and the current carries it off.  To add to the trouble, the pranks begin.  A chilling limerick, based on the Seven Deadly Sins, is found with each prank that happens.  At first the pranks seem harmless.  Then it turns deadly.  Derrick Justin is found hanging from a rigged platform.  Pinned to his shirt is only a single word -- lechery.  <br />Who wants to ruin Mischief Night forever and doesn't want the teen center?  There are so many suspects Lindy is afraid they won't find the killer in time and it will be shut down.  Then the much needed teen center will not happen either.<br />I really enjoy this series.  Lindy and her assorted dance company friends always keep the story interesting, especially Rebo.  He is terrifically constructed.  Plus Lindy is never certain what is going on with her marriage and this always lends to the story line as well.<br />The additional characters, those working on the fair as well as those against the fair, really assist the story line. <br />I highly recommend this book and series.	2003-10-14

The company is hired to perform on a small cruise over New Year's being offered by Cameron Tyler.  At first Lindy declines attending because she doesn't want to be away from her husband Glen over New Year's.  Plus their son Cliff would be home from the holidays and even though he would spend most of the time with his friends, she wanted to be home to see him as much as possible.<br />Then Glen gets sent to Paris to work over the holidays and Cliff heads on a ski trip with friends.  So, Lindy agrees to go.<br />She shares a cabin with Biddy McFee, the company's business manager. David Beck, rock star, is their neighbor across the hall.<br />Suzette Howard is in charge of the Stars of the Metropolitan Opera who will also be performing.  Her daughter Dede is traveling with her. <br />Things start happening when they arrive.  When Suzette sees Danny Ross and Adelaide Kyle, the married cabaret act, arrive with their son Richard, she freezes in place.  Lindy can't figure out what that was about.  Then the first night out, Suzette says Danny Ross was murdered and pushed down the stairs.  Nobody is at the bottom of the stairs, and Danny Ross is asleep in bed.  Lindy isn't sure what to think..<br />David Beck is another strange person.  He appears to have multiple personalities -- man, child, and rock star.<br />Then there is a dead body at the bottom of the stairs.  But, Cameron Tyler insists on telling everyone (even Lindy) that he just had a concusion and was flown to a nearby hospital.  Lindy knows this can't be true; she saw him -- his neck was obviously broken. <br />More things continue to happen.  There's another murder.  Lindy befriends David and they begin to try to sort out what is happening.<br />I highly recommend this book.  The dance company characters are just that, characters and Ms. Freydont has done a great job in building each one.  They work well together, too.<br />The cruise as the setting is terrific as well.  All the players are confined to a ship.  Makes it a little easier to investigate.	2003-09-28

Her parents sold it to them for $1 when they decided to retire.  <br />I like this series because Sophie always gets herself into some situations.

Then there's her gay son Rudy and his grown daughter Margie.  Both play important roles in most of the stories.<br />This story was well crafted.  She had enough people involved to keep you wondering which one did it.  I wasn't disappointed with the ending, nor could I figure it out too early.<br />The Minneapolis setting is interesting too.

His parents took good care of him and he never went hungry, but they never had any of the extras.  Matter of fact, when his father became ill and later died, Fell had to get a job.  His mother took his checks and gave him a small allowance to spend.  She was a cold-hearted woman and controlled his life.  Then one day he returned from work at the hotel to find his mother dead.  Instead of grieving, he feels relieved.<br />Even before he can decide what he will do, his parents' lawyer calls.  Fell finds out that his mother left him a large sum of money.  Where did the money come from?  They lived like misers.  He could have gone to the university.  They stole his youth!   Fell goes home and begins going through his father's desk to find out more about his parents' financial situation.  He finds a cash box full of money.  Why would they hide money in the desk?  Could it have been gotten illegally?<br />Aunt Agnes, his mother's sister, comes to call.  She is concerned that Fell will need someone to care for him so she has decided to make the sacrifice.  Fell is stricken with horror.  He immediately tells her that won't be necessary because he is engaged to Maggie, a co-worker at the hotel.<br />Next he needs to tell Maggie and see if she will go along with his charade.  She is a very plain girl and it turns out her home life hasn't been great.  She is thrilled with the idea.

Fell has no problem with this in the beginning.  <br />Fell's house is vandalized.  Is this related to the old robbery?<br />Fell and Maggie are great characters.  Underdogs all the way.  You can't help but root for them.  This is the first book in a new series by a terrific author.  I already like her other two mystery series.  This is another terrific series and I can't wait for the next book.<br />I had a little trouble with some of the terminology because it is set in England, but I really enjoyed the book and recommend it highly.	2003-08-16

Sarah donates clothing to the mission.  <br />Sergeant Frank Malloy is called to the scene of a dead woman in City Hall Park.  He recognizes the hat as Sarah's and is convinced she is dead.  He is quite relieved to find it was not her and agrees to investigate the death.  Sarah is able to identify the woman as Emilia, a girl she met at the mission.<br />Sarah is so impressed with the work of the mission that she decides to volunteer her time and agrees to help host a dinner at her parents' house to raise money for the mission.  She is also looking into Emilia's death.  Frank has forbidden her to do this, but it doesn't seem to stop her.<br />Emilia's family is no help.  Sarah begins to get an uneasy feeling at the mission.  Could one of the girls killed Emilia out of jealousy?  Could someone in Emilia's former life have caused her death?  The Catholic church refuses to bury her due to her past.  So many questions but as Sarah gets closer to the truth, she is put into danger just as Frank feared.<br />There are very few mysteries set back in history that I enjoy reading.  This series is one.  The characters and settings are so real and the lack of conveniences only enhances the story.  <br />I really enjoy the relationship between Frank and Sarah, although I hope in the future that they get together.  The tension does add to the story.  Her neighbor Mrs. Ellsworth is a great character as well.  She really adds character to the story.  <br />I am always amazed by the immense poverty.  This book brings a lot of that forward as the mission is a dangerous area of town as is Emilia's parents' apartment.  Frank constantly travels through dangerous parts of town looking for Danny to get information.<br />I highly recommend this book and series.	2003-08-16

Thirteen years ago he left the NYPD under suspicion of shooting an unarmed black teenager.  He and his then partner, Jake Toronto, saw a gun in the teenager's hand, but none was ever found.  Jake now lives in nearby Leonardtown.  Both Jake and Frank are now into falconry.<br />Frank is out hunting with Armistead, his red-tailed hawk, when they discover the body of a teenage boy in the brush.  Dewayne Turner turns out to have ties to Frank's teenage daughter, Nicole, over in Leonardtown.  She lives with her mother.  Frank tries to contact Nicole but is put off until Nicole calls one night letting him know she is in the Leonardtown jail.  She was arrested after the Sheriff received an anonymous tip that they would find drugs in Nicole's car.  She took off and they ended up in a chase before they caught her.  Made it even worse for her.  Then they tied her and her father into Dewayne's death.  Now Frank needs to find out who really killed Dewayne and whether Nicole is into drugs.  His ex-wife Camille isn't much help.  Nor is her current boyfriend Kevin Weems.  <br />Commonwealth's attorney Priscilla Thomasen appears to help Frank try to find the truth, but he always knows that she is the one bringing charges against Nicole.  He worries what they might find.<br />New evidence is uncovered in the long ago shooting involving Jake and Frank.  The now retired police officer they had gone to assist in New Rochelle thirteen years ago, Officer Cahill &quot;Cat&quot;, has also moved back to Leonardtown.  He and his wife have a restaurant.  <br />Frank needs to find the killer before more people are killed and his daughter is convicted.<br />This is the first in a new series.  I enjoyed this book and I definitely like Frank and Jake.  They are complex but very likeable characters.  I especially like the Virginia setting as I that's where I live so I recognize many settings in the book.<br />Falconry is new to me, but I enjoyed getting to know more about it through this book.  I will begin reading the second in this series tonight.  Can't wait.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2003-08-16

New York Detective Sergeant Frank Malloy summons Sarah Brandt, a midwife, to the elegant home of famed magnetic healer Edmund Blackwell.  Mrs. Blackwell has gone into labor after finding her husband dead in their home.<br />Frank determines that Mr. Blackwell was murdered although it appears the killer tried to make it look like suicide.  As he begins investigating, Sarah, who has helped him with previous investigations, has to keep returning to the Blackwell's since their new son has become ill.  In her many trips to their home, she begins to find out some important information regarding his death.  Frank  does not want her helping with the investigation, but realizes his wishes will not be heeded.<br />Frank and Sarah find that things were not as happy in the Blackwell household as first thought.  Then there are all Mr. Blackwell's female clients who seem overly upset over his death.  And there is a scandal that was about to be made known in Blackwell's past.  Is his assistant too eager to take over?  Who killed him and why?  Could it have been regarding one of these issues or is there another issue they don't know about yet.<br />Normally I don't like mysteries set back in time, but this is one of the few series that are the exception.  This series is so well written.  The characters are so real and the time-period laid out so well.  I often find myself amazed that the police back then were so brutal and so many people were living well below poverty.  The darkness of New York really adds to this series.  Her writing of the time and the way she lays out the story without giving the killer away is terrific.  You never know until the killer is revealed who did it.<br />This cozy mystery is great.  I highly recommend this book as well as the whole series.	2003-08-15

She goes with Weezie to camp out the night before the big sale at Beaulieu to try to help her.  Unfortunately Weezie discovers a dead body and becomes the prime suspect for the murder.  <br />In the meantime she runs into her hunky ex-boyfriend, Daniel Stipanek.  Things get steamy as they reacquaint themselves.  <br />Mary Kay Andrews definitely has a hit series.  I can't wait to read the next in the series.  Weezie is a fabulous character with lots of spunk and reality.  You feel everything with her and are constantly cheering for her, too.<br />I think Ms. Andrews must have written romances before.  The steamy scenes are so well written and without all the unneeded smut!  I applaud her!<br />I especially like the Savannah setting. It is so rich with scenery, and I felt I could see each one.<br />Uncle James is a great character too.  Then there is her mother and don't forget Tal, her ex.  They are all so well described.  The thing I really like is that they don't fall out of character.  She keeps them separate and makes them so real.<br />I highly recommend this book and can't wait for the next one.	2003-08-04

Why she went into business with her ex-husband, she's not sure, but they get along better as business partners than marriage partners.  They own an antique shop called McClintoch and Swain.<br />Lara goes abroad to do the buying.  This time, while abroad,  she is going to Bangkok, Thailand to visit Jennifer, Rob's daughter, who is there with her boyfriend Chat Chaiwong.  Rob, a policeman, is Lara's significant other.<br />Clive asks Lara to look into the disappearance of William Beauchamp.  He left his wife, Natalie, and disabled daughter some time ago fleeing to Thailand.  He opened an antique shop there.  Now, he hasn't been heard from or seen for months.  Lara finally agrees and meets with Natalie to get any pertinent information.  He sent her some amulets which Lara takes with her.  They might help with her inquiries.<br />The many characters she encounters in Thailand, and the many escapades she and Jennifer experience, are very believable and add to the intrique.  I think Lyn  did a great job at creating the Chaiwong family -- showing their wealth and thus various attitudes throughout the book.  She always brings some history into the books as well.  This history adds to the story.<br />Most of the books in this series have exotic settings.  I know that Lyn does a lot of research and it shows in the great descriptions and knowledge of the areas.   It makes me feel like I've been there after reading the book.<br />Lara is a great character.  She is very well developed and her actions are quite believable.  She doesn't do really stupid, dangerous things like some characters.  Most her dealings are something a regular person might do.<br />If you like exotic settings, history and mysteries, you'll like her books.  I recommend them!	2003-07-31

In Taneysville, Massachusetts, a builder is developing fifteen acres of land.  The vestry of Trinity Episcopal Church, just down the hill from the construction, meet to figure out a way to stop the builder.  The noise and vibrations from the machine are damaging the church.  John Stark, a vestry member, goes up to confront the builder.  Unfortunately this does nothing to stop them.  The people in town are quite upset as none of the local tradesmen were hired for this job.  They brought in a foreign crew.  <br />Then a skeleton is found by the construction crew.  This stops the machines and workmen.  The police take the remains to be analyzed and will not allow them to continue.  They are concerned this might be a sacred Indian burial ground.  So until the skeleton is identified, no work can be done.<br />Mitch Hoffmeyer, a politician who grew up in Taneysville, hires P.I. Rosco Polycrates to identify the remains.  He doesn't want there to be any fuel his opponent can use.  Then Rosco's wife Belle, crossword editor, starts receiving anonymous crossword puzzles with hidden clues.  She and Rosco start asking questions and soon find that not is all that it seems in this little town.<br />The author has done a great job of describing the tensions in this small town.  It is all very believable and I felt like I was there.  All through the book you know the unidentified older woman in the nursing home is important, but you don't know until the end why.  <br />I like this series because it is always set in New England and the plot is always more complex than you initially think.  There are twists and turns that finally bring you to the conclusion but you can't easily figure it out ahead.  I always think I have it figured out and then more information is brought out and I have to start all over again.<br />Please read this book.  It is great!  The whole series is too.	2003-07-29

He always carried it with him.  She wonders how it ended up in a box in the attic instead of in the rubble of the plane crash that killed him and her mother approximately 15 years before.  He was a scientist during the Cold War years.  She reads the entries made the day he died.  It starts her looking into what was going on back then and how and why they died.<br />Charlie and her brother Ron run an investigation firm.  Ron agrees to try to get a copy of the NTSB report about the crash.  Charlie set up a meeting with Jim, an NTSB official, who calls and says he has important information to give her.<br />The deeper Charlie gets into the investigation, the more dangerous things become for her and those involved around the investigation.  There is also danger for those who are close to Charlie.  Who could have caused her parents plane crash and why.  What secret can be worth killing for after so many years?  Who is next?<br />This is the first book I have read by Connie Shelton, but I don't expect it to be the last.  I enjoyed it.  I found Charlie to be a very likeable sleuth.  Her brother Ron and fiance Drake are also well constructed and believable characters.<br />She did a great job with the setting and bringing forth the concern of danger from the investigation. <br />I definitely recommend this book.	2003-07-11

Her ex-fiance, Luc, comes to town to try to woo her back.  He also wants her to help him to set up a foundation for abused children.   She knows that if she doesn't see him and get closure once and for all, she and Simon, the town mortician and coroner, will never have a future.<br />Scumble River is celebrating its bicentennial.  There are many activities, including the re-enactment of the discovery of Scumble River.  Gabriel Scumble, the last of the Scumble's, has been brought from Montreal to participate in the re-enactment.  <br />Then he is discovered dead at the bandstand.  Skye once again gets involved in helping to solve this crime.  This time Wally, the police chief, does not get mad that she is helping; neither does Simon.  <br />She has her hands full with problems at the high school as well.  Also, her uncle Charlie is acting strange.  And then Luc is suspected of killing Gabriel Scumble.  What more can go wrong?<br />This is small town at its best.  Denise Swanson has a hit series on her hands.  I truly enjoy every book and love the various small-town characters.  They are so true to form.  There is always something going on behind the scenes in town as well.<br />I feel as if I've been there.  She does a great job of describing the location and characters.  You can also feel the tension between the various people.  Skye's mother is a real character.  This book only has a few members of Skye's family really introduced.  In previous books the whole family has been involved.  What a group of characters!<br />If you haven't read one of Denise's books, I recommend you run out and buy one.  Once you do, you won't be able to stop reading them!	2003-07-11

This book is terrific!<br />Emily Andrew accompanies her grandmother on a seniors tour of Switzerland.  She expected a travel brochure vacation, but the fog never lifted and the food was nondescript.  Iowans are fanatical about being on time, so much so that they are usually half an hour or more early.  This about drives Emily crazy.  She has lived in New York long enough to no longer have the compulsion to be so early.  <br />Andy Simon, the tour escort,  was a Senior who was always sweet talking the ladies.  Then he is found dead.    Emily agrees to be the tour escort in Andy's place.   <br />Sexy Detective Etienne Miceli  begins investigating Andy's death.  He and Emily hit it off immediately.

The things that Emily had to endure and the way she describes and sees things is truly funny.<br />I highly recommend this book.  I can't say the scenery was beautiful due to the fog, but she describes it so well that you can see it as she does.  The characters are an absolute hoot.  The romance between Etienne and Emily is tastefully described.  <br />You won't be disappointed by this book.  I can't wait to read the next book due out in August 2003.	2003-06-21

I'd definitely enjoy a visit at the Inn at Hemlock Falls run by sisters Meg and Quill.  I think that's why I enjoy this mystery series so much.  It's set in a place I could see myself visiting.<br />Meg is the chef at the Inn and Quill is the manager.  In this book the town's mayor, Elmer Henry, tries to convince Meg to judge the Fry Away Home contest being held in town.  Meg emphatically refuses.  She is appalled to be asked to judge a deep fat frying contest.  Harry Holcomb of Holcomb's Wholesome Fried Chicken wants celebrity chef Banion O'Haggerty to judge the contest.  Unfortunately O'Haggerty wants more money than Holcomb is offering.  Elmer will have to come up with the difference.  He'd rather Meg do it -- he wouldn't have to pay anything.  Holcomb is opening the town's first Holcomb's Wholesome Fried Chicken.  O'Haggerty arrives and decides to stay at the Inn.  Meg hates O'Haggerty.  Then Holcomb's most hated rival, Colonel Cluck, is setting up shop here, too, and decides to stay at the Inn as well.<br />O'Haggerty is found dead.  Meg and her fiance, Andy (and the town doctor), are suspects.  Meg and Quill jump into action to help solve the murder.  Sheriff Myles Hales, who Quill sees on a regular basis, is not happy when Meg and Quill try to help.  He even calls in an old friend he once worked with, Jordan Bellemarin, to run the investigation as he was too connected.<br />The setting in this book really assists this story.   Having everyone staying under one roof helps in the investigation and \\"snooping.\\"  The characters are very well developed and life-like.  The plot always has plenty of twists and turns.  I definitely couldn't figure this one out ahead.  I also like that Quill, who does most of the detecting, is smart.  I don't like books where you can't figure out why they can't see what's right in front of them.  I never feel that way in this series.<br />I highly recommend you read this book.  It is the greatest in a long line of great books in this series.	2003-06-08

Who is behind this?  Helena begins to show her true colors.  She is a snob with a heart of stone until the camera is rolling.  Then she is all class.  Could she be behind the disappearance and death?<br />I have read the whole series of books set in Hemlock Falls.  They are delightful and easy to read.  I feel as if I know Quill and Meg.  They always end up helping solve the crimes.  Quill dates Myles the local sheriff and he doesn't approve of her help in these matters.  <br />There are many wonderful characters who work at or stay at the Inn in each of her books.  Dina, the receptionist, is the one who recognizes Helena and alerts Quill.  Doreen, the head housekeeper, with her many opinions and schemes often helps Quill but can also be an embarassment.<br />Then there's the town Chamber of Commerce.  Quill is the secretary, but she can't seem to take readable notes.  The Chamber is always sticking their two cents into the mix.  In this book they set up the Little Miss Falls beauty contest and attempt to get Helena to cover it on her show.<br />Quill gets herself into many situations while looking into the disappearance and death.  The plot is very well written and the setting is beautifully described.  I would love to go there for a stay.  I highly recommend this book as well as the whole series.  They are great!	2003-06-03

She is constantly reminded to not include the police.  There are many twists before you get to the end.    This is a very enjoyable series.  I enjoy trying to complete the crosswords even though I am not very good at them.  There are always clues in them.  I like when Belle tries to complete the crosswords and gives some of the crossword answers in the book.    The characters are very believable and well developed.  Rosco is believable as a P.I.  He used to be a detective so he has connections in the police department.  I like the character Carlyle who is the medical examiner.  He and Rosco do not get along but he likes Belle.

Norman Rhodes, one of Hannah's favorite people and one she dates occasionally, has bought the Voelker place from Rhonda Scharf.  He is a dentist in town.  He is planning to tear the house down and build their dream house.  They had designed it together and won a contest.  Hannah is surprised by Norman's decision to actually build it.  She wonders if he is going to pop the question.  When he doesn't she worries that she has gained too much weight and goes on a diet -- tough to do when you bake cookies all day long!<br />Hannah is also seeing Mike Kingston, head detective with Winnetka County Sheriff's Department.   So, on one hand she is happy Normal hasn't asked her to marry him.  She'd have to give up Mike!<br />Delores Swensen, Hannah's mother, and Carrie Rhodes, Norman's mother, own and run Granny's Attic, an antique store.  Before Norman demolishes the Voelker house, Delores is going to go through it looking for antiques for their store.  She asks Hannah to come.  Norman is coming too.  Delores has a habit of putting Norman and Hannah together.  She is hoping they will eventually get married.  Although there are times both Norman and Mike are invited to events by Delores.  Then she places Hannah between them at the table!<br />When the three of them are looking through the Voelker house, Hannah discovers one of her Lemon Meringue Pies partially eaten with ants crawling on it.  She takes it out to the trash.  She sees the remains of two take-out meals of osso buco. <br />Delores goes downstairs to see if there are any antiques.  When she returns, she looks like she has seen a ghost.  Close.  She'd found a dead body.  <br />In this book Mike doesn't mind Hannah looking into this murder.  Usually he has fought with her when she has looked into a murder.  <br />Hannah's older sister, Andrea, who is pregnant with her 2nd child, begs Hannah to let her assist.  Andrea is married to Bill, Mike's boss.  Their younger sister, Michelle, has come home to visit and assists them as well.<br />Not only has their been a murder, but then some money from a long ago bank robbery appears.  <br />I thoroughly enjoy this series.  This latest book is very enjoyable.  The recipes sound scrumptious too.  Hannah and her relationships with Mike and Norman are fun to find out the latest.  <br />Lake Eden is a great setting for books.  It is a small town but near the big city.  Joanne has made me want to vacation there from her fabulous descriptions.  The people sound like they would be fun to get to know.<br />I like that Hannah and Andrea are getting closer.  I would like to see Hannah get married, but I can't decide which man I'd want it to be with.<br />Hannah's cat Moishe sounds like a playful but loving cat.  I like how he keeps stealing her pillow and how he insists on getting his food.<br />I guarantee reading this book, and the others in this great series, will make you laugh but will also make you hungry!	2003-03-17

She volunteered time at the Theatre now and then.  She was found by Johnny Wales, a stage hand at the theatre.  The only eyewitness to her murder is John Partridge.  He is an alcoholic and thinks he is a CIA agent.  He was sleeping it off in the alley.<br />Detectives Rick Klayman and Mo Johnson are investigating this death.  There are rumors that Nadia and Senator Lerner were involved.  The Senator's ex-wife, Clarise, is the head of Ford's Theatre and was unaware that Nadia was volunteering time at the theatre.  Clarise is also to be confirmed as the head of the National Endowment of Arts within the week.<br />The Senator and Clarise's son Jeremiah becomes a suspect in the murder when a previous boyfriend of hers mentions that Jeremiah dated Nadia.  That information is confirmed by another source.  <br />Mac Smith is now a professor of law.  He is teaching a special class on Lincoln the lawyer.  He was a criminal lawyer until a drunk driver hit and killed his first wife and only son.  He is remarried to Annabel who was a divorce lawyer and now owns and operates a Columbia art gallery.  Mac is asked by Clarise to assist Jeremiah when he is arrested.  Mac and his former law partner Yale Becker represent Jeremiah.  <br />Detective Klayman wonders if they haven't been hasty in arresting Jeremiah.  He's not convinced that all the other suspects were sufficiently interrogated.  <br />Mac and Annabel are surprised by the Senator's and Clarise's detachment from Jeremiah through this ordeal.  <br />Detective Klayman is very interested in President Lincoln and attends Mac's class.  They are careful to not discuss this case, just Lincoln.<br />I am very happy that Margaret Truman has returned to her Capital Crimes series.  I like Mac and Annabel and always enjoy seeing Mac get involved in a murder investigation.  They feel like very down-to-earth people to me.  Like your neighbor next door.  <br />The Senator in this book was very well written.  He was very detached and always too busy to deal with the daily problems.  <br />All of the peripheral characters were well constructed as well.  In the end of the book, I found myself flip-flopping from thinking one person did it to another.  I wasn't able to easily pick out the killer.  A sign of a good mystery!<br />I highly recommend this book and all the books in this series.  The fact that I know the DC/VA area that was discussed always makes it more interesting.	2003-02-11

Her husband Merle -- the town butcher who was not well liked -- is found in pieces wrapped in his own butcher paper.

The police feel it's an open and shut case.  Jake and Ellie don't.<br />Then there's another death.  This one appears to have been a heart attack, but Jake and Ellie feel it was murder and related to Merle's murder.  With an attempted murder, things really start heating up.<br />Christmas is just weeks away.  Jake had planned to rehabilitate her old house this winter but now she's on the trail of a killer.  There are so many suspects.  Ellie and Jake spend their time checking each one out and eventually they end up in danger themselves.<br />Jake is also a newlywed with a teenage son.  Her ex lives in town and keeps coming to her for help with his new relationship.  He is a very self-centered man.<br />This author has created a wonderful town -- Eastport, ME -- with fabulous characters.  They are very believable and act just like I would expect people in a small town to act.  Her plots are always very well constructed and I have a hard time figuring out who did it and why.<br />I have read 1 other book in this series.  I highly recommend this book and the whole series.  This a true cozy series.<br />I like the friendship between Jake and Ellie that has developed.  I hope the relationship of Jake and Wade is more prominent in other books.  She spends more time talking to her ex in this book.  I'd like to get to know her son Sam better.  I think in some of the earlier books he plays a bigger part.  One reason she moved to this town was to get him away from his old friends and drugs in the big city.	2003-02-10

I found myself really feeling for Charlotte in her concern for her health and her frustration with turning 60.  It is all very believable and well constructed.  This series is definitely a quick read.  You will want to keep reading until you get to the end.<br />I like the relationship developing between Charlotte and Louis, Judith's soon to be ex-partner.

He rents the house from her that has been in her family for years.  She is a Feng Shui practicioner.  She had received an anonymous payment and request to perform a Feng Shui consultation for his birthday.  <br />Her cousin Phyllis Waterhouse is the Chief of Police.  Their relationship is strained because their grandfather left the Perfume Mansion (the house she'd rented to Palmer and surrounding land) to Salome.  Dora Whalen, the Perfume's housekeeper, lives in the caretaker's cottage on the grounds of the Perfume.  Salome's ex, Gabe, is a famous mystery author.  Salome did lots of research with him when they were married.  Palmer was a famous artist.  <br />Salome looks into Palmer's life and tries to help figure out who would have wanted Palmer dead.  It ends up putting Phyllis and her in danger.<br />This book was not one of my favorites.  It is well written, but I found it to be VERY heavy with Feng Shui.  I would have liked the story better without so much description of Feng Shui.  I don't think it contributed to the story.<br />I will say that I have read the 2nd book in this series and liked it much better.	2003-02-10

Her murder is staged to look like she was speeding again and lost control sending her car through the retaining wall and down the mountainside.<br />This book is a prequel to Stream of Death in this series.  Ed McAvoy is Chief of Police in the Village of Peekamoose Heights, NY.  He has come here to get away from the big city. Sgt. Jim Culpepper is 2nd in command in the police department.<br />Jennifer Rooney is Veronica Loring's long-time friend and current partner.  She assists Ed McAvoy in finding the killer.<br />The scenes in Veronica's house after her funeral are the best.  Bill Stackhouse did a great job of setting this up and surprising the reader at the end.<br />Bill Stackhouse's description of Lucille McAvoy, Ed's sister-in-law, is so well written you can actually see her and hear her.  From his description, I doubt most of us would enjoy talking to her and this really comes across.<br />The plot in this book is so well written you don't anticipate it.  This is the first book I've read by this author.  It is great.  I got very engrossed in the story.  <br />I like how you know HOW the murder happens but don't have to know WHO did it.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It is a must read.	2003-02-10

Of course, none of the pranks could be proven to have been done by them.  Skye takes her 2 nieces to a couple pageants to see things first hand.<br />This book has many twists.

I like the friendship developing between Salome and Judah.  I think they work well together.  I hope they do more investigating together in future books.  I think Salome is constructed better in this book and we get to know her a little better.  <br />There wasn't as much Feng Shui in this book and a lot more investigating.  This made it more believable and kept my interest.  I recommend this book.	2003-02-10

With Elise gone, all he did was miss her, but yet he's not sure what type of relationship they have.  There was too much of that in this book.<br />This series is very enjoyable.

Typically I only read cozy mysteries -- those with very little sex or violence. This goes over that barrier but does not contain as much sex and violence as a hard core mystery. <br />It stars Joe Picket who is a game warden in Wyoming, his wife Marybeth who is pregnant with their 3rd child and their 2 girls Sheridan and Lucy.  Joe recently replaced Vern Dunnegan as game warden and the locals still can't get used to that fact.<br />Sheridan tells her dad of her dream of a monster coming into their backyard.  Joe discovers that Sheridan wasn't dreaming.   Ote Kealey was found dead and bloody on their woodpile out back.  Ote had been camping up on Wolf Mountain.<br />Joe's perplexed as to why Ote would come to his house.  To protect his family, Joe has them check into a local motel.  Then he sets out with Wade, another game warden, to discover what was going on up on Wolf Mountain.  <br />This thrusts Joe into a race to try to save not only an endangered species, but to figure out a mystery that will threaten his life and his family.<br />I liked the author's character, Joe Pickett, and his family. I enjoyed the way the author lets you see things from Joe's point of view as well as from Sheridan's. I don't know much about game wardens and it is not a profession I would think would be interesting for a book, but it is in this series. I felt I got to know a little about the profession and the problems and joys of that profession. <br />I HIGHLY recommend you read this first book.	2002-10-26

Kali finds out her friend has been killed and notifies Owen Nelson, DA and candidate for governor, about the slaying because Kali is concerned there are things about Anne's death that are similar to the Bayside Strangler murders.  Both Kali and Anne had worked with Owen on that case.  <br />Owen is concerned that publicity of this could kill his run for governor.  So he asks Kali to come back to his office and discreetly assist the detectives on this case.  <br />When there are more murders, the press makes the connection and it can no longer be kept quiet. Kali assists the 2 detectives and ends up in danger.  Uncertain of who the dangerous one is, she starts accusing those closest to her.<br />I always like this series.  This author is one of my favorites.  She has another series as well with a suburban housewife as an amateur sleuth that I love.<br />I was a little hesitant to read this book as I was afraid it would be filled with gruesome details and be a scary read.  That is not the case.  The information is presented in a way that you know the danger and type of killing, but it is not dwelled upon.<br />I recommend this book and both of her series.	2002-08-27

I highly recommend <BR>this book and the complete series.<br />One of the things I like is the authors description of his <BR>preparation of the various seafood that he has caught and <BR>then cooks.  I am not a big seafood eater and so this gives <BR>me insight into a type of food I would otherwise not hear <BR>about.  I also like his description of Martha's Vineyard.  <BR>Matter of fact, I like it so much that when we were <BR>recently on a 9 day vacation in New England we went to <BR>Martha's Vineyard.  We weren't able to stay long, but at <BR>least I got to see some of what he describes.  <br />Having read most of the series, I also like how he builds <BR>on the relationships of the characters.

US	52764679	R3M0NUJAND7989	0140058362	562019909	Dark Nantucket Noon: A Homer Kelly Mystery	Books	2	4	6	N	N	Hard to read	This is the first book I have read by this author.  I began reading this at the beginning of our vacation to New England.  I almost didn't make it past the first chapter.  I stuck it out another chapter to meet the main character Homer Kelly.  That made it bearable.<br />I must say that this is not one of my favorite books.  I just didn't feel that the characters flowed with each other.  I especially did not like Kitty Clark who was accused of the murder.  She was too flighty for me.<br />Homer Kelly, a former lieutenant-detective and academic, was her attorney.  He is the main character of this series.  I did like him.  So I will try another book in this series in time.  I hope that not all her books are written in this same way.<br />There just wasn't any connection between the characters and maybe that's the way this story needed to be told in her opinion, but I felt it was too disjointed and Kitty had no \\"confidant\\" friend other than her attorney whom she had just met.<br />I prefer a series where you really get to know the characters...<br />The setting as I stated is on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts.  Kitty has come there to view the eclipse, as have many other people.  She stumbles upon a dead woman at the lighthouse who happens to be Joe Green's wife.  Kitty and Joe Green had an affair before Joe was married.  She is still in love with Joe and had tried to NOT run into him on the island.  Kitty is accused of the murder because of this history and the fact that she is found by the dead woman with a knife in her hand.  Homer Kelly comes to her aid and helps her unravel the truth.	2002-07-12

Benni and Gabe Harper are very likeable characters.  I did find this book a little harder as Benni and Gabe are at odds through most of the book.  I didn't like how Benni handled things, but then not everyone handles things the same way.  Once I was able to accept that, I was able to settle down and enjoy the book.<br />In this book Gabe's ex-partner is passing through town.  When Benni meets this ex-partner, Del Hernandez, she is quite surprised to find out Del is a woman.  Gabe had never mentioned having a woman partner, even though this was before they met.  The former relationship of Gabe and Del puts a lot of strain on their marriage.<br />Benni is asked to inventory four trunks full of materials possibly related to the decades-old bludgeoning death of wealthy Garvey Sullivan.  While inventorying these trunks, she begins to speculate about the murder and thus starts investigating.  It helps her keep her mind off her personal problems.  <br />Benni always seems to investigate things in a way that makes me want to read the next page and then the next.  I have a lot of trouble putting these books down.  I highly recommend this book and the whole series.	2002-06-16

I felt like I was right there again.  This was a great first mystery.  I look forward to reading the next in the series.<br />Callie is a great character.  She has a haunting past which by the end of the book she is starting to put behind her.  I do hope that in future books she will start to make friends who can help her sleuth.<br />A restaurant at Nags Head is a great location for a mystery series and look forward to a long running of this series. <br />Highly recommend this book.	2002-02-27

The interaction between Hannah and her sister Andrea is fun. I've read the whole series and their relationship has really progressed. I really enjoy it that they investigate together. The recipes in this book sound great. I really want to try the pancake cookies. I must say that I guessed the killer but not the reason why. I found myself drawn to keep reading as I kept wanting to find out the outcome. I recommend reading this book and the whole series. If you like fun mysteries that are easy to read, you'll love them!!!!<br />This series is set in Lake Eden, Minnesota.  This book is set during the first annual Winter Carnival.

I plan to read the whole series.  I enjoyed the main character Beth Harley.  Her 3 law partners were enjoyable as well.  She is dating a homicide detective and at first he is jealous of her sleuthing, but in the end accepts her help.  I hope in future books they might even work together to solve crimes.<br />An old classmate from law school is murdered and she was writing a brief for him and feels compelled to solve his murder.

I plan to read the 2 previous books now as well.<br />I enjoyed the characters.  Jacobia is a smart amateur sleuth.  She and Ellie are a great team for investigating.  She is a newcomer to the area but was knowledgeable about the area and with Ellie's help got the locals to talk to her.<br />Her exhusband is an unlikeable fellow and I was glad he wasn't too involved in the story.  <br />I would like to see a little more interaction with her son Sam and her boyfriend Wade.<br />I felt this story was very good.  I did have an inkling as to who did it before it ended, but I wasn't sure.<br />I recommend this book.	2002-02-06

I like Alexandra Walters, the gospel singer/amateur sleuth.  The author has lots of insight into the life of a gospel singer and this really shows.  I like getting to know the other singers and Alex's housemates.  The boyfriend with the mafia ties is a great touch, too.<br />Being a mother, I could really relate to Alex's feelings of not wanting to lose her daughter, Jessica.<br />I like the clues given.

But in the end, it turned out to be something I could unfortunately believe.  <br />I like this series set in the Inn.  The customers are always a hoot.  Magdalena is hilarious in all her antics and beliefs.  I don't really get into her carrying around a kitten in her bosom though.  <br />I always look forward to reading more in this series.  Highly recommend it.	2001-09-05

I think with each book we see Joanna mature.  And now with Butch, we see her struggle to be sheriff, wife and mother.  He has to struggle to be a sheriff's spouse -- with all that comes with that.  It was neat getting to see how she saw herself back as a child in how Jenny felt now.  I think she needed to remember.<br />The Arizonz scenery is great as always.  Joanna's co-workers are maturing in each book as well.  I feel she has a much better raport with them now.  Which is how real life is, too.  This is a well-written series.  Great book.	2001-09-05

The author is also a gospel singer and you could tell she knew what she was talking about. I like the main characters in this cozy. <br />It is an enjoyable first book by this author. I am hoping there will be many more in this series. A quartet singer from Alexandra's past is murdered and she is one of the many suspects.

Many people in town remember  her high school graduation speech in which she  did not talk nice about the  town.  <br />I enjoyed this cozy and cannot wait to read more.  The sleuth is  likeable and the story moves quickly but she doesn't omit important items.   There aren't so many characters that you lose track of who people are.  She  gets into a few sticky places (don't all amateur sleuths).  It is a fun,  quick read and I highly recommend it.	2000-08-29

I had never read any in  this series before.  I have read one of her Hamish Macbeth mysteries.  I  truly enjoyed this book.  I will be reading many more Agatha Raisin books.   She is a grumpy character in the beginning of the book but as time goes on,  she mellows (not lots).  I like the characters she interacts with.  I  usually don't enjoy British cozies as I tend to prefer books set in  America.  But I read this for an e-mail mystery discussion I am in and  really enjoyed it.<br />Agatha Raisin retires from her PR firm she has sold.   She moves to the Cotswolds -- the dream of her life.  Quickly she finds  herself bored and tries to get the village to notice her.  There is a death  and then when she starts asking questions, she ends up getting into a lot  of trouble.  I also enjoyed Detective Bill Wong and her friend and  ex-employee Roy.  They liven up the story.  James Lacey that comes into the  story near the end appears to liven things up as well.<br />I believe there  are 9-10 others in this series.  Can't wait to read another!	2000-08-29

Probably helps that I got to have lunch (one on one) with J. A. Jance last  year.  <br />Joanna Brady is a Sheriff in Arizona.  She is also a widow and  single mom.  I like the way J. A. Jance has developed Joanna's 12 year old  daughter.  She has gone through a lot but yet isn't an obnoxious child, nor  is she a wimp.  Joanna has gone through a lot as well.  In this book she is  to marry Butch.  Her neighbor and friend Clayton dies.  He used to help her  feed her animals after Joanna's husband was killed by drug dealers (in a  previous book).  She always has a lot to deal with -- running the Sheriff's  Dept., taking care of her daughter, keeping peace with her mother (a  full-time job), getting to know Butch (in the past books), and trying to  solve various murders and crimes. <br />Lucy has run away because her mother  is getting out of prison.  Her mother killed her father and Lucy has been  living with her grandmother.  She doesn't want to see her mother so she and  her red-tailed hawk Big Red run away.  <br />I normally don't like books where  it isn't told in first person, but this is one series that it works well  for.<br />I really enjoy this series and am always waiting for the next  installment.	2000-08-29

I truly enjoyed this cozy series.  The two main characters are Hillary and  Jane.  Hillary is a Southern Belle who is rich.  She is a decorator but  cooks too.  Jane is a single mom who can't cook or decorate but works for  Hillary.  They are fun together and get into all sorts of messes.<br />In this  book they go to the south of France so Hillary cn attend a prestigious  cooking school.  Hillary wants to rent a house that is expensive (even for  her) so she gets other people from their Alabama town to go to France with  her.  Of course there are murders and Hillary and Jane are in the thick of  things but end up solving the murders.<br />I actually wondered about the  people who ended up being involved.  I didn't solve it exactly but was on  the right track.  I can't wait to read the other books in this series:   Deathday Party and Leading an Elegant Death.	2000-08-29
