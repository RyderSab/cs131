There is something about Caroline that you can always associate with - maybe the common \\"fears\\" women are always prone to.  But, MERRY Recluse - hardly.  Caroline didn't seem to fit in the skin she was in - in so many ways.  Been there.  Closer to the end she SO DID - in her passion for dogs.  I have ALWAYS been a fan of Caroline's, yet I find such sadness (and lack of confidence) in her.  Just wish she could have lived doing cartwheels, hugging her dog and not questioning or interrogating herself so harshly.  I think we all question why we just don't seem to FIT IN - as Caroline obviously did.  Maybe the answer is that we don't have to.  I sadly acknowlege her death.	2005-09-13

Love all the little trivia.  Susan is an excellent, engaging writer - nothing boring or pompous about her style.  If I could have another sister, I'd sure pick her.  Obviously, she is strong, independant, positive, caring and her own woman who appears to be hugely happy in living a GOOD LIFE.  Most of all, loved her crazy little footnotes - uplifting and silly - and sometimes passages in the book also shared this humor.  I get tired of stodgy, know-it-all types and Susan surely ISN'T one.  She doesn't come across as the snotty \\"expert\\". That is appreciated!  The only downside for me was in not knowing a portion of the animals she was writing about.  Some were pretty obscure for this gal from Kenosha, WI.  Great job to Susan.  You're a credit to YOUR species.	2005-04-18

She is the strong one, the stable one, the woman I most liked.  Yumi turns out to be a pretty crappy mother, among her many other faults.  It was an okay book, but predictable.  Although I saw it coming, the ending did turn out to my liking. Momoko was another undervalued jewel.  In the scheme of likeable women, Yumi (for me) came in a distant third.	2005-02-17
US	52931164	R2KBL75HQK6D2G	0399148981	638165429	By Way of Water	Books	2	3	8	N	N	Weak.	Perhaps she is a fairly new author and future books are bound to get better.  I found her story depressing of course, and also a bit weak.  While teachers and friends try to discover why Justy never talks, nary a word or concern about this upsetting condition comes from her parents.  A bit hard to believe on that score.  Generally, depressing through and through.  I also found it unlikely to believe that a child of Justy's age could think at a level of such maturity.  All of the characters were a huge disappointment, altho that was perhaps the authors intent.  I am not trying to be overly harsh - I think Charlotte Gullick has it in her to write a more profound book.	2004-11-05

I took my time with this book.  Pondered and reflected.  Much of what he says seems to make so much sense.  Our life in the modern world has so much to do with the progression of events happening 150,000 years ago.  This book is a good one to help with male/female relationships. I found the book extremely interesting.  The only portion I didn't enjoy as much was the Adam/Eve suggested portrayal.  It went on a bit too long.  But, because of this author, I seek to know more.  Ordered The Red Queen and fully intend to find out all I can.  To you Mr. Shlain I extend my thanks.  You are a good teacher and I appreciated your book.	2004-08-17

Such a pretty little book.  Sorry to say, expected the read to be a bit better.  The ending threw me and wasn't as I'd hoped.  I guess it's true that reading (as education) can change a person - but not always in the way we would hope.  Somehow, I am much disappointed in the Little Chinese Seamstress.

Edie divorces her husband because of the abuse, and yet Edie is an abuser herself. I suspect that Edie truly tried to shine and be a good mother, but once the abuse got going she was like a tornado totally out of control - she couldn't stop. Another confusing thing is that Graceanne really pushed all of her mother's buttons and did some really devastating things to a family that was already struggling and near the end of their rope....huge library fines, the dress, etc. Not that I condone the abuse, but I found myself thinking &quot;STOP GRACEANNE - you're pure and simple asking for it!&quot; And, the last question, why in this mother's mind was only Graceanne beaten? Sorry to be so stupid, but what do you really suppose happened when Graceanne tells Charlie that they are swimming to Illinois???? What do you think readers? Do they live or die????  One other question I direct to myself:  why do I keep picking out books that are so sad - depressing?	2001-09-11

I don't think friendship is too awfully deep when you screw around with your best friend's husband.

The very most shocking and disapointing event in the book is when the main character fails to save his ex-girlfriend and her daughter from inevitable death. As a matter of fact, this character failed miserably. Lots of people stand by and let bad things happen - fail to get involved - believe they can't make a difference. Sadly, that's sort of what this book was about. I hope our culture produces better than that.	2001-08-28

The main character's name is no less than &quot;KENDRA&quot;.  Doesn't that give you a clue?  She's weak, insecure, helpless, can't cook very well and pretty stupid.  The old helpless victim saga.  Finally, she figures things out - but, had I not gotten this book at a rummage sale, I doubt I would have ever read it.  It was pretty easy to surmise who the bad guy was.  It was about worth what I paid for it - a quarter.	2001-07-09

Yet, I felt when reading this book, if only heterosexual love could always be this fulfilling and deep.  Todd and Jacob definitely  got the idea of commitment and love RIGHT in this book.  We should all do  as well.  While I (a heterosexual) have no bias whatsoever to the gay  lifestyle, I hold optimism, through this book, that those struggling with  acceptance of this issue will find their answers here.  The only part of  the book I didn't really care for was Summer's extremely long lasting  confusion about Nicholas.  I loved the quotes throughout the book.  'Think  I will write some of those down to pass along to others.  Many were very  inspirational.  Good job on this book.	2000-07-10

I had interest in the book because Pat Conroy recommended it - and he is an author I have quite a lot of respect for.  Sorry, this book was pretty much drivel in my opinion.  No depth.

It's always so nice to find other people that see animals in the same heavenly light.  If my husband asked me to make a choice between him and my beloved dog - I'd pick the dog.  The reasoning would be, that if he  couldn't understand my love and very primary NEED for animals; perhaps he  never knew me at all.  But you know what?  My husband does &quot;get  it&quot;.  His heartstrings have been pulled in the same way as mine.  Pets  never leave and seldom disappoint.  When everything is topsy turvy in my  world - precious Molly comes to the rescue.  The best part of the book was  for me when George decides to take the somewhat bedraggled mother, Lupa.   He really IS an animal lover - a man with a soul.  I'm the gal that always  wants the orphans, the discarded, or the mutts.  Great book.  So glad this  book was written.	2000-02-16

Do you realize there was no &quot;villian?&quot; Rosemary is a decent person, and so is Eleanor.  Both women can easily be admired, as well as best friend Jane.  I  truly liked the sparseness (almost directness) of Amy Ephron's characters.   I will buy more Amy Ephron books.  Personally, I don't understand the  somewhat mediocre reviews on AMAZON.  I thought the book a  delight.....simple, direct, excellent writing and a wonderful story.	2000-01-19

I like to alternate reading a difficult book, followed by a &quot;quick read&quot;.  Anita Shreve is a quick read.  On the positive side, some of  her phrases rang true with me and perhaps I can even understand the  monotony or routine turns a marriage can take.  The book was easy to read -  and I guess I needed that.  Negatively, I could not fathom how quickly Sian  and Charles meet for the first time at the Ridge and hop right to it.   Think I'd be a bit more pensive after a thirty-some year separation.  Just  like in The Pilot's Wife, Sian and Charles are SO careless about their  affair! Clues everywhere.  Wake up Stephen and Harriet.  Just one other  trivial comment.  Doesn't Sian ever wear pants or snowboots appropriate for  walking the Ridge in winter?  What's with all the black dresses, black hose  and high heels?  I would have put her in hiking boots and a good pair of  jeans.  A bit too hoity-toity for me.	2000-01-18

I found myself staring at the pages -  not even willing to blink. There is however, one thing TOTALLY missing in  Annie's book - and that's a picture of her.  I carefully look at all of  Annie's beautiful photographs and I want to see HER picture, see if I can  figure out by looking in HER face the brilliance - discover some clue to  the unique way she thinks.  Maybe somewhere in a picture of her face I  could start to figure out how she performs the miracles she does.  The book  is refreshing, liberating and a treasure to me.  What is in that mind of  yours Annie Leibovitz?   You are outstanding.  Your book and its  photographs are a precious gift to me -	1999-12-13

I sat down to read Charming Billy and just couldn't get into it as much as I'd hope.  I love to read and figured this book would be a good one.  Maybe, just maybe, my mind is  preoccupied with Christmas frenzy stuff?  I thought the book more or less  predictable. It is hard for me learn to love a character that is a drunk.   All these charming little tales of Billy - but how much havoc ran rampant  with his family and friends due to his drinking?  It's hard for me to be  compassionate here.	1999-12-13

Other readers claim the book to be a little slow in the first half, although I had no problem with the  excellent character development of Mark Dooher and his power-bound  behavior.

(The horse pictured on the cover was an instant draw for her, as we have a very beloved Palamino.)  Turns out, this book will be long  remembered by me. It's got all the elements I enjoy: writing about nature  and animals, an appreciation and wonder for the land, unusual characters,  and Sophie - the determined young girl.  The &quot;Pablo incident&quot; was  agonizing for me.  I was totally dazed.  Karla Kuban has done a remarkable  job with this book....I look forward to more.	1999-02-18

On a positive note, the book was a fast read and somewhat of a page turner....a &quot;quick-read&quot;, sadly without much depth.  Every female character was a huge disappointment in that those portrayed were either  huge town gossips, bigots, or corrupt. 'Sure didn't make me feel very proud  to be a member of the female gender.  If anything, this book was a cheap  thrill.

Not a bad book overall, but I found it a bit too &quot;cutsey&quot; that  new gal in town (Meg) would form such a quick and intense bond of  friendship with neighbor, Christine.  Next thing you know, she's coaching  the baseball team, too.  It was just a bit too unbelievable to me.  I did  like the cozy description of the house and the land - details that appeal  to me.  The mystery itself was good - I found myself reading to the end  non-stop to find out who-done-it.  It was a good book, but not one to put  on my top ten list.	1998-10-07

I was most intrigued by the movie, &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape&quot;  - also written by author Peter Hedges.  Because of this, decided to get  &quot;An Ocean in Iowa&quot; to see what else this author could crank out.   To my delight, the book was a marvel.  Little Scotty Ocean is one cool,  introspective kid.  The story reads from a 7 year old's perspective and  some of the cute and ingenious things this kid thinks about are incredibly  witty.  I like the fact that in this split-up household, neither parent is  held out to readers as a failure.  Both parents are lovable characters,  even though flaws are apparent.  I looked at the picture of author Peter  Hedges on the bookjacket and really wondered if Scotty's character was  partially based on Peter's own perception of things when he was a kid.   Peter Hedges eyes tell it all; he looks to me as I'd pictured Scotty.   Great story Mr. Hedges.	1998-09-21

I picked up this book on a whim, always interested to read a Diary-type  format as they read quickly and yet you feel &quot;sneaky&quot; and  intrusive somehow reading what you would normally view as personal text.   Mattie Spenser was really a rebel in her own day, questioning why women had  to constantly submit to every whim and demand of a man.  The book is  interesting throughout - yet as a woman living in the 90's - I sure woulda  changed the ending!  Thank God women have come as far as they have.

I really enjoy John Irving books as they always are a little quirky and atypical.  This book read like two however:  Part one, the orphanage...Part two ... the apple orchard.  The thing that disturbed me was that when Homer FINALLY comes clean with his quest for the truth in his relationship with Angel, he does an about face and prepares for the second phase of his life in another huge lie.  I question how a character seeking truth so badly would consider living yet another lie.  Homer and Larch were characters beautifully developed.  Throughout the book Melony kept me in suspense, due to her explosive potential.  Don't get me wrong:  it was a very good book - but I can't believe how willingly Homer lives another lie.	1998-03-03
