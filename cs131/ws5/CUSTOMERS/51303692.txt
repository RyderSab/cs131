Carl Sommers claims that the cure for the deplorable moral decay of kids today is to teach them NOT to make their own moral judgements, NOT to question their own cultural values, and NOT to be tolerant of differing cultures/value systems. He claims that teaching kids 'too much' tolerance is teaching them not to condemn such evils as slavery. And yet he does not explain how slavery could have been eliminated from our own culture without people who questioned their own cultural values. Questioning cultural values is how we improve society. Without questioning, we stagnate as people and as a culture. <br /> <br />I can't say that brainwashing kids to believe exactly as they are told can be seen as building character--quite the opposite.	2005-04-30

A big trunk full of magical 'starstuff' must be kept out of the hands of the evil secret society by the good secret society.  Orphan Peter stumbles into the middle of it, and a powerful pirate captain hears of the 'treasure' and steals it, playing havoc with the plans of both factions.   <br /> <br />Annoying flaws in general are: 1. They pull that old, old line about how some great geniuses of the past were only geniuses because they used starstuff.  (For Heavens sake, will writers ever let Da Vinci actually have credit for being a normal human being?) and : 2.  The lamest naval tactic ever pulled.  \\"Here we are in the center of the ocean, weeks of rowing to the nearest port. I'll take the treasure in the dinky little rowboat, and you take the fast ship the pirate wants, and he'll be forced to CHOOSE which of us to chase after!\\"  (Black Stache actually captures them simultaneously, though, rather than taking blatantly obvious course of capturing the Wasp and picking up the rowboat at his leisure later.) <br /> <br />As to what makes it fail as a prequel, aside from the fact that a plausible and structured grown-up-style explanation is being foisted onto a pure childhood-style fantasy: the characters have been completely changed. <br /> <br />Don't expect Peter to be the brash, cocky little egomaniacal young child of the original.  Starcatcher Peter, quite frankly, is too old and has too much depth.  One would need to believe that he regresses unbelievably in maturity, intelligence and age from the end of Starcatchers to the beginning of Peter and Wendy. And that his ego quintupled. <br /> <br />The Lost Boys in Starcatchers do not share Peter's power of not aging.  So, if they were still boys when Wendy arrived, it presupposes that Peter dragged Wendy back within no more than a year or two.If so, it's an odd thing that a pirate captain is still sailing the seas as late as the Victorian era!  The timeline between books is insupportable. <br /> <br />Captain James Hook is the most egregious error.  Don't expect insights into Hook's melancholy, tormented soul, his mysterious upper-class past, his shocking secret noble identity, or his fall from grace. Black Stache is little more than a coarse thug, constantly screaming \\"You idjits!\\" at his crew.  I kept waiting for a clever plot twist, for Stache to be supplanted by Slank, perhaps (who was a mildly better fit) for Molly's Father to turn out to be villainous, or even for steady young James to be somehow corrupted by the starstuff into stepping into Stache's place.  No such luck.  Stache is what you see, and Stache is what you get.  One is forced to suspect that the writers had their minds poisoned by the Disney version of Peter Pan one too many times, rather than having read the original work carefully. <br /> <br />I don't really think a prequel to Peter Pan was necessary--in any event, this is one which I am sure will quickly be forgotten.  I regret that two such fine writers made such an unholy botch of their source material, and would like to advise them to stick to writing original stories.  If they were unkown hacks, I'd assume they published this because they didn't have any good ideas of their own to write: as it is, I have no idea why they wrote this book.	2005-02-22

But this tale of perserverance and determination makes a wonderful and gripping read.  The fantasy rat world is only half the story--the other half is the fascinating account of the hard work, training, and innovation of the dance troupe. By the time the Rattoons get to Rat Hollow, you know how very hard they've worked, and you're rooting for their success.  Not only was this a fun read, but it was an interesting and eye-opening look at the work that professional dancers put in before they're ready for the Boom-Boom Room.	2004-12-02

This story, with its repetitive hammering of the 'It's what's inside that counts' message is certain to make any halfway intelligent child roll his or her eyes and toss it aside as yet another piece of adult propaganda.  There is absolutely no character development or personality--the bugs only exist to blurt out their lines and platitudes.<br /><br />So, why did I give it three stars?  Because I felt the ending had merit.  Sommers actually let go of the bludgeon for half a second and came up with an effective line.<br /><br />\\"Sorry,\\" Katy called back (to the repentant bugs, as they are left behind.) \\"If you didn't like me when I was a caterpillar, you wouldn't like me now.  I'm still the same inside.\\"<br /><br />That line was ALL that was really needed to get the idea across, without all the previous hounding and nagging.<br /><br />Subtlety.

It allows you to start with basics and build up from there, in my view essential for learning a language where no friendly Latin root words are present to give you clues. <BR> <BR>For example, the kanji which stands for day/sun.  The Japanese pronounciation (nichi or jitsu) is also given, and then the book then goes on to show exactly how it acts as a root word/symbol for longer words/kanji combinations like konNICHI and sakuJITSU.  The connection between written and spoken Japanese is  extremely helpful for attempting to understand both, and connecting words in this way makes building and remembering vocabulary much simpler. <BR> <BR>If you're just starting out, this book will give you reassurance that, yes, there is some kind of sense and structure to it all, after all.	2004-01-27

Charlie Bone returns in a worthy successor to his previous book.  This sequel begins with a flashback: about 80 years ago, Ezekiel Bloor, as a child, used a small time-travel device to send his smarter cousin away to an uncertain destination.  Which, of course, means the present time.  Now old Ezekiel, still jealous of his cousin (now not only smarter, but MUCH younger), wants to get rid of him for good, and get his hands on the Time Turner once more.  Charlie must find a way to smuggle his young great-uncle to freedom against the combined forces of the school and the evil aunts.  The betrayal of friends, the tragic tale of Mrs. Bloor, secret allies among the Bloors Academy staff, the further development of Charlie's abilities--dark, tense and suspenseful, followers of the series won't be disappointed in this book.	2004-01-23

Forget the old formula of a normal person getting caught in a fantasy world, Inkheart turns that tradition on its head when characters from a fantasy novel get sucked into our world.  Meggie's father has always had the talent of bringing things out of the books he reads aloud, and it's his great misfortune that the first time he brought people out, he inflicted a particularly amoral villain on the world.  Many years after the event, that villain has taken over a remote village, and has plans for the future.  Meggie, her bookbinder father, and her book-collecting aunt must stop this heartless scoundrel from using them to expand his little empire. <BR>  The characters are detailed, multi-dimensional and engaging, and the story is a page-turner, with unexpected twists and turns. It was difficult to put down!   <BR>   While the ending was satisfactorily resolved, there are enough loose ends that this book is simply screaming for a sequel to be written.  I hope there will be one!	2004-01-23

I doubt there is a review here without the words 'Harry Potter' in it, but that's because so much in this book either resembles something from the HP books, or its evil twin.  This is a much darker and more suspenseful world than HP: no fun pranks with friends in the corners of a cuddly, friendly school....Charlie attends Bloor Academy, run by dark and evil people, where, if an accident threatens your life, the staff is more likely to have caused it than to investigate it.  It makes for a fun and suspenseful read, and Charlie's attempts to thwart both the dark side of his family and the school is aided by a few trustworthy friends.  (Though it's hard to tell exactly who is trustworthy!)  Interesting characters abound. My biggest beef with the books is: it's SO obvious where Charlie's father is! WAKE UP, Charlie!	2004-01-23

Her autobiography tells the tale of her struggle against abuse and discrimination, her adventures in school and as an animator, and most of all, the developing sense of humor which helped her get through it all.  Alternately heart-rending and hilarious, this is a book that's hard to put down.  <br />As Heidi was the child of a television producer living in Beverly Hills, celebrity-watchers should find enough famous names peppering the pages of this book to satisfy them, and anyone interested in animation history will enjoy the skewed and very alternate point of view of the pranks, politics, and subterfuge which went on behind the scenes at Walt Disney Studios animation department.	2003-11-05

I agree that this is the best yet of the Agatha Raisin series.<br />In the Case of the Curious Curate, the mystery takes a much more central position in the book than in previous episodes.  The investigation is fun and John Armitage is an excellent investigative partner, being inquisitive and determined.  Unlike the last two books, in which the murder seemed to serve as little more than a backdrop to Agatha's problems with James, this is a story a mystery lover can really get their teeth into.<br />Which isn't to say that Agatha's life is any less the hilarious soap opera!  In and out of disaster and anguish as usual, Agatha actually seems to develop a bit more confidence in this book, starting a community project on her own initiative and taking more interest in other people.  And yet she remains the same entertaining bundle of neurosis as ever!  And the supporting cast of characters are as colorful and distinctive as ever.<br />Anyone who's rooted for the abrasive Agatha through her previous adventures won't want to miss this one!	2003-04-02

The Schwinn company was built by an immigrant with a knowledge of mechanics and a fierce dedication to quality.  Over several generations, the company gradually fell apart, as subsequent, born-privileged Schwinns took less interest in the company product, focusing on marketing at the expense of manufacturing, and arrogantly believing that the prestige of their name brand would endure over their stubborn reluctance to innovate or modernize.  Along the way we get informative and interesting glances into the beginning of BMX and mountain biking, fascinating portraits of the personalities involved, and a strange sense of the interconnectedness of all the big names in the bike industry, as Schwinn's errors lead to the rise of Trek and Giant, and effect many other familiar bike companies.

This book was written after the brilliant and hilarious &quot;The Elves and the Otterskin&quot; and frankly does not have the same high level of humor.  However, there are definitely compensations!  The fascinating powers of the Dragon's Heart, the power struggles between the villains, and the richness and originality of the story, set in Elizabeth Boyer's unusual Alfar/Skarpsey world, make this a book worth reading several times over!  Books where a servant has to prove himself aren't all that uncommon, but this book goes far beyond the point where Brak has proven himself his master's equal.  There is no doubt of Brak's power and leadership before the story is half over, and we are left to watch his struggle against the machinations of Myrkjartan in gut-wrenching suspense.<br />There are situations in this book that I have never seen in any other fantasy book, and the excitement builds steadily to the final battle.  Elizabeth Boyer was one of the most exciting fantasy writers of her time, and I feel it is a crying shame that her books aren't being reprinted!	2002-08-23

Maybe this review is unfair, as I could honestly not get through the entire book.  This book is written in a sort of graphic-novel format, which is innovative and interesting at first.  As the book gets into more complex concepts, it is INCREDIBLY distracting to have every five-to-twenty-word phrase accompanied by its own (often abstract) image, sending your eyes hunting through the comic panel for the continuation of the sentence you are trying to read.

This book reads like Terry Brooks writing a Dean Koontz novel, to some degree. But the characters are fresh and likeable, the situations are original, and the plot is compelling.  And I like Dean Koontz and Terry Brooks both. :P<br /> A young girl with the potential to be a professional runner (and some minor magical abilities)suddenly finds that mysterious secrets and terrible events are happening all around her, and a demon has come to town with the purpose of taking her.  Her only protection is her tough old grandmother (also with a little magic) and a drifter who is a Knight of the Word, sworn to spend his life hunting demons and trying to prevent or postpone a horrific future which he is given visions of in his dreams. The magic is all a secret undercurrent under the otherwise normal small-town activity.  The plot is suspenseful and captivating!<br /> My main complaint with the book is the way some characters babble on for ages explaining all the plot points and events the reader might not have figured out on their own, especially Pick, and especially at the end.	2001-04-18

These books read in a doleful, deadpan, Poe-like tone, while discussing terrible events...events that become so terrible that they cross the line to silliness. You have an old-style melodrama villian in Count Olaf. In the three heroes, you have the distilled goodness, courage, resource and sweetness of every hero of every melodramatic childrens book ever written. In Mr. Poe you have the quintessential essence of those eternal, frustrating characters who always refuse to believe children because they ARE children. Every character and situation in the book is a stereotype, overblown and caricatured to the point where you are forced to giggle at it.  Sunny's 'conversation', the author's autobiographical notes, and the sometimes hilarious definitions of words add to the spice. For good measure, the three children are honestly likeable!  Very well written, both stylistically, and for 'grab' value. A series to be read and reread and snickered over many times!

Not much chance of either these days.<br />Others are situationally specific, like asking your parents to take you to see a famous old fort (nice if there's one in the neighborhood) pull out the weeds in the vegetable garden (if you have one, know what a weed looks like, and it's the right season) or helping your parents polish the silverware (How many people HAVE actual silverware these days?) or going to your older brother or sisters swim meet (if you have one and if they happen to be in the swim team and their school has swim meets.)<br />Other things you wouldn't necessarily want your child to have a try at, at least without supervision.  (Can you leap over someone who is in a crouching position?  Do you know how to use the fire extinguisher?)<br />Other things are simply sugary reminders to wash your hands, wipe your feet, and pick up after yourself.<br />The general tone of the book is pure Christopher Robin and Little Lord Fauntleroy, and many of the suggested activities seem anachronistic and completely out of touch with reality and modern times.<br />There are a some activities in the book which are useful and workable, but the title would be more accurate if it were 101 Activities rather than 1001.	2001-03-16

Each day, the ghost of a little girl relives  the day of her death...knowing that one day, her childhood friend will come back through the hedge and allow her to change the horrible events of the day she  died.<br />Meanwhile, decades have gone by, and a young girl comes to live  next door with her miserly, domineering, hermit grandmother.  Eager to  escape her unhappy situation, the girl follows a ghost cat through the  hedge...and starts off a bizarre series of ghostly events and time  travel.<br />This book is seriously creepy, and remarkably clever.  It keeps  the reader unsure and in suspense until the end of the book!  The same  writer has written &quot;The Ghost in the Swing,&quot; which is probably  one of the best ghost stories written for younger readers.	1999-08-22

They made compass cases out of melted phonograph records!  They made air tubes out of hundreds of cans!  They hid tunnels everywhere!   And it was  all TRUE!!!<br />Unfortunately for me, the rest of the class whined that the  book was boring (!!!) and the teacher had us turn them in.  He had to pry  mine out of my fingers.  Years later, I was finally able to get a copy of  the book, and it was worth it.<br />I'd like to list the truly amazing things  they did to escape the Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, but I wouldn't want to  spoil the book for anybody.	1999-08-22

(I got it as a child, and still read it!)  A girl staying with her aunt is haunted by the ghost of another aunt she never knew she had--a girl her own  age who disappeared in childhood many years ago.  The ghost needs the  girl's help, but there is a cruel streak to many of her pranks which keeps  you wary, never able to trust her.  Great characters make this book even  better.  Apart from the girl and ghost, there is the eccentric ghost-hunter  aunt and the creepy neighbor.......not to mention the mystery of how  Felicia died.  Jane Patton Smith wrote another book, too--The Twisted  Room--which is also a fascinating ghost story worth reading.	1999-08-22

Not since the companion volumes  &quot;The Bully of Barham Street/A Dog on Barkham Street&quot; has any  writer really made the concept of point-of-view so beautifully.  Sara's  enemies all become friends as she learns to understand them and their  problems.  And, naturally, helping them helps her to stop obsessing about  her own troubles and makes her a stronger person.<br />A joy to read, and good  for you, too! ;o)	1999-08-22

US	51303692	R1YHLORY64GIMB	0380729342	425070591	Tales from Watership Down	Books	1	8	11	N	N	Disappointing	I must say, I was disappointed with this book.  It seemed to me that Adams didn't really bother to re-read Watership Down before he wrote it.  The characters seem to have blander, flatter, altered personalities.  There is  moralizing, pontificating and preachiness.  The rabbits, who questioned  what on earth a camel was in the Tale of Rowsby Woof and the Fairy Wogdog,  suddenly have a story featuring all the exotic and far-away animals Man has  extincted (as if they would have a clue about this!) Prince Rainbow, the  enemy and jailor of the rabbits, is suddenly their helpful friend!   Completely unrabbitlike things are done casually, such as riding on another  animal's back.<br />The thing that gets me the most, though, is that  Elairhrairah (forgot the spelling) no longer does his remarkable deeds with  the cleverness of his own quick wits, but by the use of magic!  This  obliviates the whole concept behind the rabbit legends in the previous  book. (Be clever and full of tricks, and your people will never be  destroyed.  Oh, and don't forget your magic wand and glass slippers!)<br />I  agree with those who say Adams did this mainly as a way to churn more cash  from his old work. That and a chance to do a little more human-bashing  where people would listen to it.	1999-08-22

I read it when I was 9 and loved it.  I read it again when I was 34 and loved it again!  (Actually, I read it several times between, as well.)  Long John  Silver is arguably one of the most Macchiavellian characters you will ever  find between the covers of a book.  (I'm mainly reviewing it to raise the  average rating.  Anyone who thinks this book is boring has to have a screw  loose!)  From the arrival of the mysterious Billy Bones, to the attack on  the inn, to the sea voyage, to the mutiny, to the battle for the island, to  the treasure hunt, even to the final fate of John Silver, this book is a  stunning rollercoaster of suspense and adventure!  I'd give it ten stars if  I could. <br />Here's a bit of information you other readers might enjoy:  the  meaning of the pirates' song--<br />Fifteen men on a dead man's chest Yo ho ho  and a bottle of rum!<br />The real-life pirate, Edward Teach (Blackbeard the  Pirate) once marooned 15 of his men on a small island named Dead Man's  Chest.  He put them ashore with no weapons, equipment or supplies--just a  bottle of rum.	1999-08-22

There are Gilligan-themed recipes, favorite recipes of cast members, and Dawn Wells' own family recipes, along with an interesting story about her family's  history in cooking!  (Naturally, there is a plethora of coconut-cream pie  recipes as well!!)<br />Between the recipes are fascinating behind-the-scenes  stories about the cast members, Gilligan trivia, and bits of script from  the series.	1999-08-22

It's a great dog story without any of the anthropomorphizing or exaggerated canine brilliance found in most dog books.<br />The main characters are a boy and his grandfather and a German  Shepherd named Blaze.  The boy is an orphan, living with his fussy aunt and  uncle.  The grandfather lives far away and raises German Shepherds. The  grandfather sends the boy a puppy, but the aunt and uncle immediately get  rid of it, giving it away to the uncle's co-worker.<br />A year later, tragedy  has struck.  The kennel has burned down, killing all the grandfather's  dogs.  He comes to fetch Blaze, hoping to start the bloodline over again,  but finds that the dog has turned savage from abuse and neglect.  He takes  the dog and goes home, not realizing that the boy has stowed away in the  back of his truck.<br />Together the boy and his grandfather get to know each  other and retrain Blaze. <br />This book has humor, suspense, mystery, and  tears.  The dog is all dog, and the people are complex and interesting.   Essential for the dog enthusiast.	1999-08-22

Becky Sharp grabbed me from the beginning with her  rebellious spirit, and I think it is only pure Victorianism that she ends  up....well, the way the novel ends, she's obviously on her way down.   <br />But as for the novel in general, it's a soap opera that keeps you  tearing your hair out, because everytime you are waiting with your jaw  hanging to find out what happens to character A, Thackeray suddenly  switches to the storyline with character B, or off on one of his little  side discussions of his club buddies or something.  There's no better way  to maintain suspense!  The many humorous bits, especially Jos Sedley :o) ,  add to the books considerable charm.  <br />Boring?  Never!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1999-08-22

There are quotes, urban legends, comic book covers, movie synopsis, and lots more.  My favorite is a photo of an ivory carving  of a ratcatcher, with the rat escaping by climbing over him.    If you have  a horror of rats, you'll enjoy the book.  The author herself seems  fascinated but horrified with them.  If you like rats as pets or just as  interesting animals, you will find that the book leans heavily toward the  horrific and sensationalistic.  References to bitten babies and devouring  hordes abound.      There are positive references to rats as well, but they  are in the minority, including a quoted paragraph from the Rats of Nimh.   Positive references have obviously only been cursorily researched.  There  is, for example, no reference to the history of keeping domestic rats,  stories of prisoners in the Bastille taming rats, mention of Jules  Verne's(!) story The Adventures of the Rat Family, though much lesser  authors are quoted for much less rat-oriented literature.	1999-07-16

It's the story of a rebellious orphan girl sent to live with a cranky, eccentric aunt, against both their wills.  In the aunt's garden live strange and rare little animals called  Bogwoppits.  The girl befriends one, even as her aunt is trying to  exterminate them.<br />The book is filled with moments of intense horror,   hilarious humor, and unexpected plot twists.

The information is divided into small fact capsules with illustrations, which keeps it from ever being boring or overwhelming.   And there's so much on a page that the book's worth re-reading several  times, in case of something missed or forgotten.  A gotta-have for the  piratically-minded!	1999-07-15

Good Luck Arizona Man is the story of a white boy raised by Apaches, trying to discover the secrets of his own past  and heritage while keeping his Apache identity.  He goes on a search for  the lost gold of the Apaches, which is tied up with his own mystery.   Unfortunately, the mountains are filled with bizarre and dangerous white  men also searching for the gold: and the Apache chief has sent men to  ensure that the prophesy (he who finds the gold must die) comes true<br /> The  book is humorous and whimsical, with many surprising plot twists.  I doubt  that the portrait of Apache life and customs is very accurate, but the  white men are equally ridiculous.  In any case, the characters (and their  names--Head Toter, Tied-Up, Miss Utter Delight, Fantail and Poop, Old  Wickiup, Missing Toe) are hilarious and unforgettable.	1998-11-27
