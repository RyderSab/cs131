Let me start by saying that I own everything that Lawrence Block has published.  That out of the way, let me say this:  What did he think was pulling this story together?  There is no compelling theme, no protagonist, no cogency as he flits from one character to another without any particular purpose.  The sex is a poor substitute for plot mechanisms.  Was he writing in the hopes of selling the book for conversion to a soft core movie producer?  Was he in a rush to bring out the defining post 9/11 NYC novel?  Whatever the motivation, the finished product just does not reflect the level of expertise and craftsmanship that Block has demonstrated in other efforts. What a disappointment.	2003-03-15

A master of concise character development, Starr has put together one gem of a fast reading look at the life of a young man trapped in his life in Brooklyn.  You can only hang on for the ride as Mickey Prada makes one poor decision after another and watches his life go down the toilet.  A likable enough guy, Mickey is not too bright.  His inability to size up the situations in which he finds himself leads to the destruction of the limited life he knows.  Crisp clipped dialogue and scenes rife with local color and characters give this short novel a stunning vibrancy.	2003-03-15

I played a lot of ball in the 60's and have no where near the recall of detail that he has (maybe he had filsm to review? - he does reference newspaper clippings throughout the book). While being a former ballplayer is not a prerequisite for enjoying this book I imagine it would help if you've had some time on the hardwood.  He does bring a beautiful poetry to what was then a beautiful sport.	2003-01-26

In fact, even many people who have pituitary tunors go to their graves (from other causes) without ever knowing that they had them.  Almost half of these tumors are now discovered as \\"incidental findings\\" when a patient is given a CT or MRI scan for some other reason.  Once you have the diagnosis howver, you really need some guidance as to your options.  This book will help you find that guidance and help inform your opinion about an area that the average family doc is not very fluent in.	2003-01-26

Short chapters, stereotyped characters and familiar angst in familiar surroundings. If you are not a Parker fan, it may be difficult to swallow that the heroine can just put on a wig and successfully present herself repeatedly in close quarters to a psychiatrist (whom she has already met several times) as a comletely different person.  If you are willing to overlook that particular plot lynchpin, then you're likely to enjoy the book.	2002-09-28

In order for mind candy to work, however, it must be at least minimally plausible.  The willing suspension of disbelief just doesn't work here.  Unlimited funds, international absolution of all sins and the treatment of foreign countries like they were just another NYPD precinct dosen't cut it.  Character development is lacking here and so is the usual cast.  While The Two Chinatowns gave usual protagonist Detective Brian McKenna's partner (Detective Cisco Sanchez) center stage, The Protectors gives short shrift to all of the previous supporting roles.  Okay reading for a long flight, but just not the grabber I've come to expect from Mahoney.	2002-09-18

This is a poorly written and disorganized book. The descriptions of characters behind the walls are one dimensional and self-serving.  The attempts at relating corporate skills to prison survival skills are shallow at best. The story of the crime the author committed to get to prison does not ring true on any level.  This story sounds like a thousand others, only perhaps this guy is a bit more literate and knows an agent.  A larger than average vocabulary does not make you a writer any more than it makes you a pro-social member of the community.	2002-08-24

It is a collection of stories about individuals who worked in a couple of fire companies that responded to the WTC.  While the author gets a few technical details wrong (A little fuzzy on the rank structure of FDNY in one place and not accurate about the FDNY communications disruption by the collapse of 6 WTC - it was the &quot;nerve center&quot; of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Mgmt, not FDNY.  FDNY had repeater antennas that came down in the collapse.), the depiction of the characters is the result of good research turned into good writing.  Halberstam does nothing here to tarnish his reputation as an excellent writer.  This book, by being about the people, rather than the event, begins to help those outside FDNY begin to appreciate the magnitude of the loss.	2002-06-05

Nonetheless, anybody who rides the Pike, lives in or around the Pike or has an interest in big road building project will find this little book fascinating.  The author tries to orient the reader in all of the pictures because so much of what was available for reference is either gone now or because the pictures themselves have a moonscape quality to them.  I would have liked a large locator map in the front of the book, with reference to it tagged on each photo.  That would have helped me to &quot;put things in place&quot; in my mind.  I also would have liked a little more detail on why things went they way they did (why did the Pike not go through Worcester, for example). All that being said, however, I know a lot more about the Mass Pike now than I did before; which is what I hoped would happen when I bought the book.	2002-06-05

His research is thorough and he makes history entertaining.  This book will appeal not only to medical and mental health professionals, but also to those readers interested in social history, McLean Hospital neighbors and Boston history buffs as well.  Just knowing about \\"ice-pick lobotomies\\" done on an outpatient basis is payoff enough for buying the book!  The descriptions of characters, systems and a different time not really that long ago is fascinating indeed.	2002-05-30

Second half:  Fair narrative	The interviews(in the first half of the book)with the people who were present for the attack make for compelling historical reading.  I suspect, however, that a re-read in a couple of years may yield some opinions different from those prevailing now about actions taken that day. Indeed, some very heroic deeds took place that day - some by public safety personnel and some by civilians.  But there were also deviations from standard practice that may ultimately be viewed as unnecessarily risky.  It is too soon now; but at some time in the future there may be an opportunity to learn some lessons from some of the breakdowns in disicipline that Smith chronicles, as well as a failure to act on initial assessments of building stability.  Beyond that, there will also be questions (alluded to in the book) about fire proofing, construction, fuel tank placements, and the wisdom of having certain types of occupancies in these kinds of buildings. All in all, this is a record of a very sad day.  The second half of the book is less intense; but that would almost have to be expected given the nature of the events chronicled upfront.	2002-05-19

The willing suspension of disbelief which is essential for the success of a good fiction read becomes more and more difficult as the book progresses.  Unexplained details (a character who is described as a &quot;miracle worker&quot; is a repeated deus ex machina whom the author inartfully uses to tie up loose plot ends, e.g.), impossible coincidences (an ex-con known to the protagonist just happens - out of the absolute ether - to have the drop dead connection to the bad guy) and unresolved plot lines (what happened to the social worker and the ex-wife?  They simply disappeared!) sink this book.  Deaver is a talent but it is not evident here.  If this was a first novel, it would be tagged with a slew of &quot;Thanks but no thanks&quot; letters from any publishers to which it was sent.  Too bad.	2001-05-09

They have a mixture of outrageous humor, explosions, dwarfs, dead bodies, a grandma who is downright dangerous with a stun gun and a 45, and a couple of love interests thrown in for you to occasionally catch your breath. I'm surprised they haven't made a movie out of at least one of these books. In this latest episode, Evanovich once again mixes the usual players with the right combination of both new characters and new twists on Stephanie's relationships with a few of the old characters.  Along the way, you get to know more about Trenton than you really want to, while at the same time feeling that you really did know Trenton all along - you just know it as the town you grew up in.  A good fun read that leaves you waiting for the next installment.	2001-01-18

I came late to this series, but I have enjoyed every minute of catching up.  The Stephanie Plum/Joe Morelli relationship allows for more comic riffs in this book, as the various members of the Morelli clan run through pre-wedding rituals.  The usual cast of characters (and they are, indeed, &quot;characters&quot;) is joined by a new gem:  Sally Sweet, the cross dressing &quot;regional&quot; rock star.  It's not often that I laugh out loud while reading, but Janet Evanovich has me to the point where I have to read about Stephanie's exploits at an earlier hour because I'm waking other family members!  This is a good fun romp through the wilds of Trenton.  Do yourself a favor and join it.	2001-01-09

I buy his books.  But Hit List?  Keller, the pro killer engages in the kinds of behaviors that you just find a little to hard to believe. The cynical hit man going to an astologer? And altering his behavior because of what she says?  I don't think so.  Then there's the matter of the back and forth between Keller and his &quot;agent,&quot; Dot.  BORING!  Filler?  Who knows?  Seems like Block had a good idea in having a hit man set up as a target.  Seems like he had a bad idea in having a short story set up as a novel.	2000-12-17

The protagonist in this series, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, has degenerated into a paranoid BORING one dimensional irrational person.  Her behaviors are simply not believable.  A person who thinks and acts this way could not hold a job as a mortician, let alone a state's Chief Medical Examiner.  This book was a struggle to work through.  Its plot contrivances seemed to be thought up on the fly and slapped into the manuscript.  At times, I was wondering if the author simply grabbed an old character (The evil Carrie) and tried to re-work her for the sake of meeting some kind of publishing requirement.  I could never really get &quot;into&quot; the story...whenever I was slipping into the fictional world created by the author, the sloppiness or preposterousness of that world jarred me back into my own.  A true disappointment and the last Cornwell book I'll ever read.	2000-12-09

Mr Bethune and his ghost-writer follow the oldest training guide:   &quot;1.  Tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em,    2.  Tell 'em,     3.  Tell 'em what you told 'em.&quot;<br />So it can seem repetitive at times.  And, it can certainly seem simplistic (I suppose it could even seem painful if you're an MBA).  However, if you step back and think about it, &quot;simple&quot; may just be the message. Not that the job of managing an airline isn't complex.  But the solutions to problems can be so complex as to get in their own way.  So, if you stay with it and pick out the pearls, you can have a nice simple list of management prescriptions.  Simple in their statement, but often difficult in their execution.  Which is probably where Bethune is different.  He didn't just talk about, he did it.	2000-12-09

The example used are purposely non-business (setting the table, getting gas for your car) so as to illustrate the &quot;concept&quot; of process mapping.  So, if you know absolutely nothing about process mapping, I suppose this is a good place to start.  However, this is SO basic, it would also help your appreciation of this book if you were a complete dolt.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for practical applications to your work processes (rather than seeting your table or getting gas for your car), you're in the wrong book!  Similarly, if you'd like to get past the basics, then you have to go past this book.	2000-11-15

A couple of examples:  He talks of a stop on the &quot;N&quot; line at 86th Street and 8th Avenue (p.259).  Not only is there not a stop there....there is no &quot;there&quot; there.  Those two streets do not cross.  Eight Avenue ends in the 70's.  Also, the author talks of the view of the Ave X subway yards and overhaul center that can be &quot;clearly seen from the &quot;N&quot; and the &quot;R&quot; Lines as they begin the Stillwell Avenue descent into Coney Island&quot; (p.5).  Problem is, the &quot;R&quot; train goes nowhere near Coney Island.  In fact, it is underground for its entire run in Brooklyn.  There were others, but I won't bore you with the details.  In a book that purports to be a &quot;guide,&quot; attention to detail is important. In a lot of cases here, we are not talking about minor details.  The prose style, if you can call it that, is way too cute.  All in all, if you want a guide to the subway, get the free map from the MTA.  If you want to know about the neighborhoods, take a bus tour and see for yourself.  Given the unreliability of the book regarding areas of the world with which I'm familiar, I'd be very hesitant to count on it for anything at all.	2000-11-02

I was willing to overlook the hard to believe level of introspection and insight for a pre-teen boy in Brooklyn (or anywhere else, for that matter).  I am pre-disposed to enjoy Brooklyn in the 50's because that's where and when I grew up.  However, DON'T waste my time with a plot you didn't finish.  This is not a novel, it's a fantasy.
