In so doing, he implicitly declared that speculative systematic theology, Biblical archeology, and history were admirable, but secondary endeavors, which must be subordinated to the study of the Holy Scriptures, especially the New Testament.<br />Dr. Frei argued, brilliantly, that theology is derivative from the canonical form of the text, rather than the interpretive principle by which we judge the Scriptures.  In so doing, like Luther, this man of God wrested the Bible out of the hands of the clerics and academics, and gave it back to the people.	2003-09-26

Smith's real contribution is not that he celebrates the life of an extraordinary individual, but that he does so without lapsing into hero worship.  The author shows us that Mullins was an ordinary man who struggled with ordinary temptations.  Mullins strength lay not in his ability to overcome temptations, but in his willingness to rely upon God's grace.<br />For all of us who struggle to live meaningful, Christian lives, this book is an inspiration!  Apparently, even in our time, and in our confused and unfaithful world, it is possible to live the faith.	2003-09-20

In this text he makes a noble effort to interpret scripture through the life, actions and sayings of the historic Jesus of Nazareth.  <br />Unfortunately, he attempts his hermeneutic task with a degree of certainty unjustified by the evidence. What Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer forgets is that neither Schweitzer nor any of his successors, up to and including the Jesus Seminar, have been able to define the life and sayings of the historic Jesus with any degree of certainty.  Consequently, Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer projects back on the historic Jesus concerns that are more appropriate to the twenty-first century a.d. than to the first.  The result is that Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer interprets scripture through a Jesus of his own making.  Sadly, he has succeeded in recasting Jesus in his own image.<br />Nevertheless, Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer's concerns about the subordination of faith to culture are important and worth pondering.  His response, forged through years of focusing his scholarly and personal life on issues of justice and peace, is worth considering.  Read this text and take Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer seriously, just as he attempts to take Jesus seriously.  However, take him with a grain of salt.	2003-09-10

Neither is it an overly difficult text, as some reviewers have claimed.<br />Instead, it is a thoughtful, scholarly, re-examination of the parables, which raises the possibility of alternate readings, more appropriate to the first century a.d., rural, Palestinian context in which the parables were first proclaimed.  Professor Herzog's work is challenging.  It refuses to accept as sacrosanct any of the old verities that many of us were taught years ago in seminary.<br />In a modified form of redaction criticism, Professor Herzog closely examines each parable in its canonical form, and then seeks to work back to the most plausible words of Jesus, consistent with Biblical archeology and the sociology of religion.  The results are new possibilities for proclamation.<br />This is not a book for the casual reader, or those who wish to maintain long-held beliefs at any cost.  However, for educated seekers of truth this book is a gem.	2003-08-23

He can be contentious.  He [is not fair in his opinions].  His myopic view of how God works in history too often denies the possibility that God might work through anything except Holy Scripture and the fellowship of the Church.  His radical commitment to second and third article concerns is purchased at the expense of an under-developed and weak first article theology.  In his world, ecumenical ministry does not include Roman Catholic or Orthodox ties.  Still, Pastor Piper does raise a number of day-to-day concerns that deserve the attention of all ordained clergy.<br />The real weakness in Pastor Piper's book is not his conservative view of the world, the Church or Holy Scripture.  Nor, is the problem that Pastor Piper is so in love with Jesus that he fails to make much of a place in his stated theology for God: the Father.  Rather, the problem is that Pastor Piper wastes his talents.  He is a lazy author.<br />Possessing strong cognitive skills, Pastor Piper wastes his abilities to state such obvious claims as pastors should pray (p. 53), pastors should read (p. 89), pastors should stand against racism (p. 197), pastors should be concerned about worship (p. 229), and (MALE) pastors should love their wives (p. 245).  WELL, DUH...  Mediocrity triumphs, again.        <br />While the issues that Pastor Piper raises deserve the attention of all ordained clergy, they do not necessarily deserve a book.  Pastor Piper has produced a document worthy of a first year seminarian, not an experienced leader of the Church.  Once again, beautiful trees were cut down and processed into paper in order to make an ugly book.	2003-08-02

The holder of a Ph.D., he serves as a professor of philosophy at Boston College: a school well noted for its intellectual rigors.  His academic credentials are immaculate.<br />Peter Kreeft is not insular.  Teaching at a Roman Catholic college and obviously holding strong allegiance to Roman Catholic tradition, he manages to quote Martin Luther and Chuck Colson.  He dedicates this book to James Dobson, Richard John Neuhaus and Alan Keyes.  His ecumenical credentials are perfect. <br />However, because Dr. Kreeft recognizes the seriousness of the issue at hand, and because he states his case with strident passion, he will inevitably be belittled by the irreligious, the merely spiritual, and liberal, &quot;feel-good&quot; Christians, alike.<br />The issue that Dr. Kreeft seeks to define is the difference between popular culture and true faith.  His is the voice in the wilderness crying that there can be no easy peace between our secular culture of death, and faith in the living LORD of life.  Accepting his claim requires learning how to see what is broken in the society that surrounds us.  <br />The response that Dr. Kreeft seeks to elicit is sanctification: more faithful obedience to God's Word, and a weakening of the claims that our sinful world makes upon its Christian inhabitants.  Accepting his call requires learning how to let go of the privileges, amenities and pleasures of popular culture.  Accepting his call requires disciplined discipleship.<br />Those who claim their privileges, demand their entitlements, and are in love with this world will belittle Peter Kreeft.  Despite their attacks, his is a corrective, conservative voice that Christ's Church must hear.	2003-07-16

Reputable sociologists tell us that as men marched off to World War II, women were forced to fill the vacancies in the factories and other segments of the work force.  As an unintended consequence, women found their own voices and the Women's Liberation Movements took on an impetus which earlier generations could only dream of.  Despite retrenching and conservative dynamics during the 1950s, the rights, strengths, powers, and abilities of women have grown more-or-less steadily ever since.  In Western culture, women have found their own voices, and they are no longer extensions of their fathers or husbands.<br />...unless you are Donald Harvey.<br />In Dr. Harvey's world, men are powerful actors, who initiate marital dissolutions (i.e.: pages 17, 19, 21, 25, 45, 133, and 187), and women are nothing more than helpless victims, who patiently endure their husbands' abuses (i.e.: pages 17, 55, 172 and 187).  Moreover, some of Dr. Harvey's conclusions are intellectually questionable, such as when he labels alcoholism or drug abuse as a choice (i.e.: page 36), despite the inclusion of chemical dependency in the DSM IV, as a disease.  Dr. Harvey paints with too wide a brush, indicating that an estranged father's love for his children is a form of manipulation (i.e.: page 141), and warning abandoned wives that their in-laws will always take the side of their missing partner (i.e.: pages 157-158). <br />Dr. Harvey's book appeals to a certain world-view that has not existed in reality since the 1930s, if it ever existed at all.<br />This book also follows the formula of man bashing, currently popular in pop-psychology, which may sell books and help to enrich Dr. Harvey, but which fails to meaningfully facilitate the dialogue between the genders.  <br />This book is worse than useless.  It is destructive.  If you don't own it, don't purchase a copy.  If you do own it, it might make good kindling for your fireplace.	2003-06-21

This is the worst type of publishing to issue forth from the ivory covered towers of our institutions of higher education.  With his concern for social justice, this effete academic snobbery would have made Walter Rauschenbusch ill.  While it may amuse the academic, it does nothing to educate the general public, because the author goes out of his way to be obtuse and frighten away the lay reader.<br />Professor Malina succeeds at painting a picture of Jesus, and the early Jesus movements, in context.  However, he does so at a terrible price.<br />Professor Richard A. Horsley has also done much to paint a portrait of Jesus and the early Jesus movements in their first century context.  The difference is that Professor Horsley's works are, generally, accessible to the lay reader.  Unless you are a doctoral student and interested in the most minute of details, read Horsley instead of Malina.	2003-06-03

Horsley argues that far from being the innocent victim of illegitimate charges made against him by an unholy alliance of Jewish religious and Roman political authorities, Jesus was a very real threat to the ruling institutions.  <br />At least from the perspective of the social, political and religious elite, Jesus was a dangerous figure worthy of condemnation in order to maintain the Pax Romana.  His radical preaching and practice of the immediate presence of the Kingdom of God implied that no other kingdom and no other authorities could justifiably be obeyed.  \\"A slave cannot serve two masters...\\"<br />For those interested in studying serious Christology, or the social and historical context of the earliest elements of the Jesus movement, this can be a valuable book.  <br />For those who wish to maintain the uninformed innocence of a Sunday School faith, this book should be avoided.

Professor Horsley argues, successfully, that Jesus can only be understood in his original context.  He further argues that Jesus can be best interpreted in corporate, rather than individual, terms.  <br />None of this is new.<br />In the last twenty pages of this book, however, Professor Horsley draws disquieting social, economic, political, military and religious parallels between imperial Rome and an imperial United States of America.  With irksome clarity and courage, he points out that ancient Palestinians resisted Western imperialism by every means possible, including terrorism, and that some of their Middle Eastern descendents appear to be doing nothing more than following that example.<br />After September 11, 2001, this is not the book to read if you wish to be comforted, or rest cozily in your Western preconceptions.

Without flinching, he describes the dysfunctional system that has resulted in denial, avoidance, minimization, anger and a self-destructive religious culture. <br />Sadly, Father Cozzens' concerns are applicable to other religious denominations as well.  All of the problems that he describes as existing among Latin Rite Roman Catholics exist, also, within the so-called Protestant denominations.  <br />Father Cozzens' remedy is as appropriate for the rest of the Church catholic as it is for the Roman Catholic church.  If the Church is to be saved from its own bureaucracy and episcopacy, the time has come for honest, direct, open, challenging, and painful dialogue.  If the laity are to escape the heavy hand of the clergy, so that they too may minister, then the time has come to end clerical privilege. <br />Father Cozzens prescribes a painful remedy for that which currently ails Christ's Church.

Nevertheless, Colson: the convicted criminal and reprehensible politician, has given us one of the modern treasures of Christian devotional literature.  <br />Colson dares to say what must be said: that loving God with one's whole heart, and mind, and soul is not an essentially emotional event.  Loving God has little to do with the heart.  Instead Colson, courageously, declares that loving God is an act of the will.  It is nothing less than complete obedience to God's revealed Word.<br />Colson is intelligent enough to comprehend that such obedience is impossible.  Still, he has the courage to uphold it as the model: the goal for all who call themselves by the name of Christ.<br />In a world flailing in a swamp of competing values and rampant relativism, Colson has the strength to stand for the absolute sovereignty of the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Jesus.  <br />Perhaps, I and those like me, who cannot seem to forget Watergate, need to learn to forgive Colson.

For more than 2000 years, Christianity has judiciously made its spiritual claims based not on forensic evidence but on Spirit-inspired faith. Being a law school graduate and a former reporter, Mr. Strobel seems all-too-ready to take his readers out of the realm of the Spirit and into the world of questionable evidence.<br />At best, Mr. Strobel's effort is a well intended, but useless attempt to prove the claims of faith in the court of world opinion. It is a sort of amusing parlor game: a cute and harmless diversion. It is nothing more than words and wishes unnecessary for believers and meaningless to skeptics.<br />At worst, this book testifies to a new Gnosticism: an attempt to prove the claims of faith by a special knowledge, which ironically undermines the faith itself.<br />Probably, Mr. Strobel's book is neither the best of what it could be, nor the worst.

By this what they most often intended to communicate is that worship attendance and church membership rolls have decreased in Europe and the United States.  Moreover, public morality today, as exemplified by public figures, is not what it was decades ago.  For many that change is also tied to a perceived loss in the Church's power, population and prestige.  <br />Into this morass of self-pity, too often expressed by uninspired and uninspiring Christians in the developed world, Professor Jenkins infuses the hopeful truth.  The simple fact is that Christianity is expanding, rather than contracting.  However, most of the growth is in the global South, rather than in the developed world.  <br />Professor Jenkins explores how this growth of Christianity among the world's poor, disenfranchised and forgotten might change the expressions and forms of religion in coming years, while maintaining the heart of the historical faith.  He draws the obvious parallels between the growth of Christianity today and the growth of Christianity in the earliest days of the Church among the world's outsiders.    <br />Professor Jenkins' book strikes a glorious note of hope.  Individual sanctuaries may close, but the faith will continue.  Religion may find new forms of expression, but faith in Jesus Christ will go on.<br />If you are concerned about the current crisis that the Church in the developed world has created for itself, then read Professor Jenkins' work, and see that there is yet hope.  God continues to act in our world.  The faith continues to grow.	2002-10-06

Without blinking, they stared into the utter darkness of loss, illness, violence, fear and failure.  Then, they applied the Gospel proclamation to each situation, thereby creating the possibility of hope in the midst of suffering.<br />Unlike earlier expository preachers, their work is not overly historical.  Unlike the American &quot;positive&quot; preachers, of the last two centuries, their work is well-grounded and theologically sound.<br />What Professors Aden and Hughes have given us is a text that is relevant and profound.  Any seminarian, deacon, elder, minister, pastor, priest, dean, or bishop who preaches to people in pain would benefit by keeping a copy of this book close at hand.	2002-08-25

By sharing stories that have often been obscured, Kirsch demonstrates to us that the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Jesus refuses to be bound by middle class morality.  By revealing a bit of the sex and violence in the Bible, Kirsch shows us how God loves, nurtures and works through even the most public of scoundrels.<br />In an age when religion has too often been hi-jacked by fundamentalists, who demand their particular version of purity, Kirsch shows us how God works in the real, messy world with real, messy people.  For those of us who are less than perfect, Kirsch's book and the \\"forbidden tales of the Bible\\" can only be received as good news.	2002-08-02

Professor Horsley has repeatedly offered us books impeccably researched and annotated in great detail.  Yet despite the promise of those works, Horsley has too often hidden his gifts behind an impenetrable wall of technicalities and minutia.  In his attempts to demonstrate his intelligence, Horsley has sometimes made his writing obtuse and inaccessible to the average reader.<br />This, however, is not one of his failures.  Here Horsley finally gets it right.  Here Horsley fulfills the promise of his other works.<br />Examining the politics, sociology, psychology and religion of the renewal movements founded by John the Baptist, Jesus of Nazareth, and Paul of Tarsus, Horsley and Silberman weave an exhilarating narrative that exposes the historical roots of Christianity.  Thoroughly comprehendible by the lay reader, without sacrificing scholarship, this book demonstrates that the authors can strike an appropriate balance between academia and popular reading.	2002-07-17

That's the way it is with Dr. Ashcroft's work.<br />Drawing extensively upon Biblical, archeological and sociological resources, Professor Ashcroft draws a vivid picture for us of the women who followed Jesus. Her end-notes are generous and irrefutable.<br />Dr. Ashcroft helps us to understand how Jesus' message and ministry liberated these women from unjust cultural and religious bonds. His presence led to freedom for them just as surely as it did for the poor, the sick, the demon possessed, the Gentiles, and all the others oppressed by the religious and secular authorities of his day.<br />Many Biblical scholars have argued that Jesus' angry exchange with the money changers in the Temple led to his crucifixion. Dr. Ashcroft, subtlely, demonstrates that the incident in the Temple courtyard was part of a larger constellation of his empowering the oppressed and standing against the oppressors, which ultimately led to his execution. In the end, the powerful men of first century, Pallestinian, Jewish society simply could not afford to allow this trouble-maker to hang around. He was just too threatening to their interests to be allowed to live.<br />Dr. Ashcroft, implicitly, argues that we have not often heard this liberating Gospel, because in a Church controlled by men it is both inconvenient and embarrassing. If that is so, then we have forgotten why Jesus came. If that is so, then we are as wrong, and as subject to judgement, as were the scribes and the Pharisees.	2002-07-07

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.&quot;  Perhaps, Professor Borg should have used those lyrics as the preface to his book.  This work is, after all, easily misunderstood.  <br />In this text, Professor Borg fills a lot of space by simply repeating material that he published three years earlier in &quot;Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time.&quot;  It's hard to understand why we should purchase and read the same material twice.  <br />In this text, Professor Borg minimizes, to the point of nearly denying, the divinity of the historical Jesus.  It's hard to understand why self-proclaimed christians would wish to read this book.<br />However, like the popular singers, who appear to have been his inspiration, Professor Borg's intentions are honorable.  This book is not so much a great piece of theology, as it is an apologetic: an attempt to reach the millions who have given up on faith as a meaningful guide to direct their lives in this world.  If Professor Borg frequently stumbles and falls as he seeks new paths for those who have strayed from the way, it is only because he is exploring new territory.<br />Chapters 5 through 7 define the true strength of this book.  When Professor Borg stops attempting to rewrite theology, and instead asks the question, &quot;How should we live on this earth at this time?,&quot; he makes his most meaningful contribution.	2002-05-25

This is not another one of those awful &quot;self-help&quot; books.  Rather, His Holiness presents a cogent discussion about the self-destructive qualities of anger, etc..., and appeals to our intellect to refrain from those emotions.<br />His Holiness' line of reasoning seems self-evident and simplistic until one observes normal, unpleasant, self-defeating human behavior in a typical traffic jam or family argument.<br />If you sometimes get unexpectedly caught in your anger, or other negative emotions, read this book.

Their arguments were brilliant, intricate, innovative and often too convoluted to be understood by those who do not hold a theological degree.<br />His Holiness the Dalai Lama has given us something new in the field of ethics.  He has provided us with a thoroughly accessible system of ethics.  More over, His Holiness' writings are as valid for atheists and agnostics as they are for theists.

Bishop Holloway provides us with a provacative, compassionate, occasionally humorous and always well reasoned argument to develop a non-theocentric ethic for the twenty-first century.  Not since Joseph Fletcher has the world seen such a strong argument for a coherent situational ethic.<br />Fundamentalists of all stripes will undoubtably object to Bishop Holloway's efforts to outline a moral system requiring the consent of those who live within it.  Such a system would potentially undermine the absolute authority that Church, State, Synagogue, Mosque and Temple have too often claimed for themselves.<br />Despite the inevitable objections of the ethical establishment, Bishop Holloway's intellectually sophisticated argument offers the possibility of a new morality that will appeal to the millions who have opted out of older, absolute, authoritarian systems.	2002-04-12

In the first half of this book, His Holines the Dalai Lama dispenses the simple wisdom so familiar to readers of some of his other texts.  Based on a talk given by His Holiness in Great Britain, the first half of the book has all of the easy ebb and flow of any open, honest discussion.  It is charming, disarming, and profound.<br />The second half of the book, however, consists of a series of sometimes esoteric, exclusively Buddhist questions and answers.  This Buddhist catechism is undoubtably of great value to Buddhist parents seeking to raise observant Buddhist children.  It probably serves well for new converts to Buddhism, also.  However, for the rest of us, the second half of the book can quickly become dry and boring.<br />His holiness has so many great books in print, please do yourself a favor, unless (1) you are seeking to raise good Buddhist children, or (2) thinking of converting, read something else.	2002-03-27

His writing style includes enough dangling participles to drive any fifth grade teacher into a severe state of apoplexy.  Despite the rulings of the courts, he still fiercely defends his father.<br />Nevertheless, Jay Bakker has something important to say, to which it would benefit all Christians (especially, those of us who are religious professionals) to listen.  <br />Bakker's message is deceptively simple. During his earthly ministry Jesus Christ dealt graciously with everyone he met: Romans, women, tax collectors, children, Gentiles, prostitutes -- everyone...  Now, the Church that bears his name dare not be any less gracious to those who live on the fringes of modern society.  To do so would be to dishonor the name of our Savior and diminish the Gospel. <br />Reading the way that Bakker confronts the hypocrisy of those who prefer the law over the Gospel, and observing the way that he let grace take an hold of his life is fascinating.  If you love the Lord and his Church, but sometimes have a difficult time putting up with all the rules and regulations, read this book.	2002-03-27

Instead, he called upon us to admit our own relative weakness, and surrender to God those elements of our lives that we shall never control.  <br />In short he called upon us, in faith, to abandon ourselves to emptiness: the great mystery.

Freedom of religion, as practiced in the United States of America, is an awful and illogical liberty.  In our quest to be inoffensive, we act as if multiple, mutually exclusive, truth claims can all be valid at the same time, and religious preference is merely a matter of personal taste.  As a consequence of our corporate irresponsibility, many are left free to follow lies and the path to eternal corruption.<br />I am a conservative Christian, who believes that the only path to truth lies through God's grace as presented to us in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, whom Christians confess to be the Messiah.  I, personally, believe that Buddhists and followers of non-Christian religions are wrong.<br />BUT...  My personal faith claims do not undermine the wisdom of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama's teachings on meditation and compassion.  In his little book, the Dalai Lama lays out for us a path to a more inhabitable planet.  Demonstrating that he fully comprehends the flawed, sinful nature of all people, His Holiness goes on to show us how all creatures can live together in a more peaceful world.

Some have even treated her as a subject of disdain. Ms. Smith effectively refutes those authors, using Adam's and Chamberlain's letters to one another as her primary source materials.<br />What emerges is the vision of a strong, educated, ambitious, self-directed, courageous, emotionally-stable and patient woman, who endured every hardship brought to her home by her husband's long career of service to his country.<br />What also emerges is a more complete picture of our nation's greatest hero. The same man who quietly endured the terrors of war, who courageously accepted an horrific wound, and who was so gracious with a defeated enemy, could become quaintly insecure when dealing with the woman he loved. The stellar academic, warrior and politician was as much of a quivering paramour as any other husband in love.<br />For Chamberlain fans, this book offers a more human image of the titan.

Professor Horsley's anthology of essays (primarily by other authors), and his introductions, do much to appropriately redefine Saint Paul's writings within social and political contexts.  Explicitly rejecting the notion that Paul is to be read exclusively as religious literature intended for a religious community, Horsley (et al.) painstakingly demonstrates that the preaching of the crucified Christ was a direct challenge to the Roman Empire.  Similarly, the building of Christian communities around the proclamation of the resurrection were intentional rejections of secular values and order.<br />Living in an age when religion has too often been high-jacked by fundamentalists of all denominations and faith groups, to serve only petty theological agendas, Horsley's collection stands for us as a useful reminder that faith can be something more.	2002-01-13

He argues against those who have rejected tradition and the teaching magisterium of the Church to cling solely to uninterpretted Scripture, as the ONLY authority for life and faith.  However, except on the lunatic fringes of religion, such radicals do not exist.<br />Even among the least &quot;(Roman) Catholic&quot; of Protestants, worship is still recognizable as Christian precisely because some core of tradition has been preserved.<br />Sunday School, Vacation Bible School, Bible Studies, sermons, etc... are universally present among so-called Protestants precisely because the teaching magisterium of the Church has not been rejected.  Its focus may have shifted from the Vatican to the local community of believers, but the teaching magisterium itself continues to be affirmed.<br />In other words, Sungenis structures his arguments against a position that does not exist.  His is a theological debate by caricature.<br />Even among the earliest of the Reformers, other authorities were recognized along side of Holy Scripture.  In 1580, the writers of the &quot;Epitome&quot; to &quot;The Formula of Concord&quot; stated, &quot;Other symbols and other writings are not judges LIKE Holy Scripture...&quot;  The point being that even at that early stage of the Reformation, tradition and teaching were valued, but Scripture was more highly valued as the ultimate arbiter in all matters of faith and life.<br />Tradition and teaching are not rejected by Protestants as Sungenis claims.  They are merely subordinated to the authority of Holy Scripture.  That's a subtle distinction: apparently too subtle for Sungenis to delineate.he authority of Holy Scripture.

This book, however, is much more worthy of an investment of your time and attention for at least two important reasons.<br />First, unlike Golay, Mr. Perry has selected a worthy individual to compare with Chamberlain.  Unlike many of his Southern compatriots, Oates was not a former high ranking official of the US federal government (e.g.: John Breckinridge or Jefferson Davis), nor was he a graduate of the US Military Academy at West Point or a former US Army officer (e.g.: Davis, Lee, Longstreet, Jackson, Bragg, Alexander, Ewell, A.P. Hill, Garnett, Pickett, Armistead, et al.).  Thus, Oates did not compound his acts of sedition with the violation of sacred oathes.<br />Second, Mr. Perry's text is not so much a comparative biography as it is a comparison of the philosophies and circumstances that led these two, brave men to heroically oppose one another on Little Round Top.<br />Following St Origin, the Church has long argued: &quot;Lex orandi; Lex credendi.&quot;  Mr. Perry makes clear that the opposite is also true: beliefs can lead to actions.  Right beliefs lead to great, heroic actions (a la Chamberlain), and flawed philosophies lead to tragically flawed actions (a la Oates).<br />Mr. Perry's real contribution is not so much that he exegetes the lives of two brave men for us to emulate.  His real contribution is that he demonstrates the power and value of our beliefs.	2001-08-14

It must take a tremendous ego for an author to give a book such a universal title.  The surprising thing is that Charles Van Doren's work comes so very close to being completely worthy of its moniker!<br />Obviously this is not &quot;A COMPLETE History of Knowledge: Past, Present, and Future.&quot;  Not even Mr. Van Doren could pull that off.  Much of the knowledge of Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Micronesia, and the indigenous peoples of Australia and the Western Hemisphere is simply glossed over.  The book clearly has a pro-Western, Euro-centric preference.  Even an author as obviously brilliant as Mr. Van Doren can only do so much in a mere 412 pages.<br />Nevertheless, the text is engaging, thoughtful, stimulating, enthusiastic, concise, and very well written.  For those already blessed with a traditional, liberal arts, undergraduate education the text will serve as a valued reminder of many of the great concepts to which they were exposed in college.  For those without such an education, the text will serve as an even more valuable compendium of Western thought.<br />Well done, Mr. Van Doren!  Thank you!	2001-07-14

Forward: My Civil War Reminiscences	Books	5	75	96	N	N	A Genuine American Hero	These United States of America have more pretenders to the title than genuine heroes.  Revisionist historians often inform us that our idols have feet of clay.  George Washington, the &quot;father of our country,&quot; was too proud to shake the hand of ordinary American citizens.  Thomas Jefferson, &quot;author of the Declaration of Independence,&quot; held others in servitude.  Abraham Lincoln was subject to deep bouts of depression.  George Patton was a bully incapable of showing compassion for psychologically wounded soldiers.  It is even whispered that &quot;Ike,&quot; the very symbol of 1950s family stability, may have had an affair during WWII, while Mamie patiently waited at home for the return of her soldier.  The list goes on.<br />That on-going litany of real world disappointments is what makes Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain so important to the American story.  In Chamberlain, we find one of the few genuine heroes, so far revealed in our short, national history.<br />In this volume, we read Chamberlain's (mostly) post-war speechs and reports on some of the most critical actions of the Civil War.  Despite his meteoric rise from Lieutenant Colonel to Major General in four, awful years, Chamberlain does not turn the spot light upon himself.  Despite being awarded the Medal of Honor, Chamberlain does not see himself as special.  Instead, in speech after speech, Chamberlain gives credit (by name) to his soldiers and to his God.  Like Alvin York, another American hero who would follow him 50 years later, Chamberlain was truly humble, and in his humility could be found the seeds of his heroism.<br />This book, like Chamberlain's other writings is a magnificent primer for those who would seek to give selfless service to their nation, their God, or both.	2001-05-26

Neither did he disappear on 12 April 1865 following his magnanimous violation of military protocol at Appomattox Court House.  In this volume, Mr. Pullen documents Chamberlain's life after the Civil War, demonstrating that the hero's character continued to illuminate all his life until his death in 1914.<br />Unlike Sis Deans', &quot;His Proper Post;&quot; Michael Golay's, &quot;To Gettysburg and Beyond;&quot; or Willard M. Wallace's, &quot;Soul of the Lion,&quot; Pullen's text does not presume to be a complete biography.  It does not address the question of what forces in Chamberlain's up-bringing formed such an extraordinary man.<br />Unlike Chamberlain's own books &quot;Through Blood &amp; Fire at Gettysburg,&quot; and &quot;The Passing of the Armies;&quot; or Michael Shaara's, &quot;The Killer Angels,&quot; and Alice Rains Trulock's, &quot;In The Hands of Providence,&quot;  this is not primarily a book about soldiers at war. <br />The question that Pullen addresses is, &quot;What becomes of the hero after the battles cease: how is courage displayed after the war ends?&quot;  In the case of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, and other great Americans, the answer is that true heroes continue to demonstrate the same commitment to service in peace as in war.  True heroes demonstrate the same integrity and courage in their chosen civilian occupations that they once showed while facing iminent death.  <br />Forget the trendy books on leadership and values.  Instead, read Mr. Pullen's book.  Be inspired by the story of an exceptional leader, who demonstrated his commitment to American values until the day he died.	2001-05-10

This book does not provide what I sought.  It is clearly an apologetic for Pope Pius XII, the Curia, and all things Roman Catholic.  Professor Marchione is, after all, also Sister Margherita.<br />There are ditches on both sides of most roads.  It is just as possible to fall into one ditch, as it is to fall into the other.  Whereas Cornwell fell into the ditch of vilifying an holy and decent man, Marchione falls into the other, seemingly canonizing the late Pontiff well before the Vatican has concluded that (inevitable?) action.  Dr. Marchione's commitment to her faith and her passion for this cause, out-shine her scholarship.<br />Nevertheless, this is a scholarly book in which Professor Marchione goes far to prove her points that the Holy Father was not silent in the face of the Holocaust, was not cowered by Hitler, and acted decisely to save hundreds of thousands of intended victims of the Third Reich.  The end notes, annotated bibliography, appendices, documents, and indices take up approximately 1/3 of the book.  Dr. Marchione's scholarly documentation, alone, makes this book worth reading.  Her appeal to the original source documents handily refutes the arguments of Cornwell, Hochhuth, and others, who attempt to drag the good name of the Holy Father through the mud of innuendo and lies.  <br />To counter the argument that the Pope kept silence during the Holocaust, Sister Margherita presents to us the encyclicals &quot;Mit Brennender Sorge,&quot; and &quot;Summi Pontificatus,&quot; as well as the thirty-three wartime messages which directly addressed the issue. To counter the argument that the Vatican did nothing to save the Jews, or others, hunted by the Nazis, she tells us of the thousands hidden in the old Roman ruins under the Papal residence at Castel Gandolfo, and the hundreds of thousands hidden in churches,monasteries, and convents throughout Europe with the knowledge and approval of the Holy See.  Then, just to make her point, she introduces us to Israel Zolli, the Chief Rabbi of Rome, who converted to Christianity after the war, taking the Pope's first name as his own.<br />This is not a neutral, dispassionate history.  Still, unlike some of what has been written lately about Pope Pius XII, it is fair.  It is well documented.  It is well written, and it is worth reading.	2001-04-28

I read this book in one sitting, because I could not bear to put it down.  I'm not easily moved, but Ms. Opdyke's story of life as a young woman in Nazi occupied Poland moved me.  I don't easily cry, but I shamelessly cried several times while reading this book.<br />This is an inspiring tale of courage and resistence in the face of unambiguous evil.  It is also the hope-filled story of grace found among the most surprising of individuals: two Soviet physicians consipring to help a young prisoner of war to escape; a Wehrmacht Officer's Club manager blithely feeding slave laborers with luxuries intended for the &quot;master race;&quot; a simple Ukranian priest openly preaching resistence; a Nazi officer sheltering Jews in the basement of his villa!<br />Above all, this is a story of choices: a story of ordinary people immersed in a living hell, who chose to keep faith with each other, their ideals, their country, and their God.<br />In a time when too many among us seek to avoid responsibility, here we find the story of a young woman who willingly took responsibility for herself  and dozens of others.  In a time when politicians conveniently twist &quot;values education&quot; to their own advantage, here we find the story of a woman whose religious and ethical heritage repeatedly demanded the best of her, even under the most dangerous of circumstances.  Here we find a heroine on the order of Oscar Schindler or Raul Wallenburg.  This life-affirming tale demonstrates that even under the most extreme circumstances, one righteous person can still change the world for the better.  For that reason alone, this book is worth reading.<br />If you have been wounded too often, and have become just a little too cynical about the world, read this book.  If you enjoy a thrilling adventure story, laced with romance, read this book.  If you want to inspire a child (especially a girl) to greater moral courage, read this book with her.

Although the author attempts to paint Pope Pius XII as a Machiavelian character, what he accomplishes is to outline one of the great tragedies of our time.<br />Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII) grew from childhood to maturity at a time when the Church was under siege.  Living in a family of conservative, lay canon lawyers, the young Pacelli witnessed the loss of the Papal Territories and the declining secural powers of the papacy.  He also saw the anti-modern, anti-liberal, and anti-democratic backlash inspired by those defeats.  From the time that he was a young man, Pacelli was DESTINED to become a conservative Catholic, placing his hopes for the future of the Church on an authoritarian, centralized bureaucracy and papacy.<br />As an up-and-coming member of the Curia, and as the Papal Nuncio to Germany in the 1910s and 20s, Bishop Pacelli witnessed much of the revolutionary chaos and violence of the twentieth century.  He was DESTINED to fear Communism as a threat to the Church, and his flock.<br />As the Cardinal Secretary of State for the Vatican in the 1930s, Cardinal Pacelli concluded a much-criticized concordant with Hitler, that mirrored the appeasment policies of France and Great Britain prior to World War II.  His was a politic informed by his abiding fear of Communism, and his geographical location within facist Italy.  Within the limits of an harsh reality, he attempted to negotiate the best possible position for the Church and millions of Roman Catholics in an openly hostile Germany.  He was DESTINED to act naively before a cynical dictator.<br />Pope Pius XII's times were complex and dangerous.  To be portrayed accurately, those times must be painted with great delicacy.  Instead, the author paints with too wide a brush.<br />The author is openly hostile to his subject: evenafter his coronation as Pope Pius XII, the author simply (and offensively) refers to him as &quot;Pacelli.&quot;<br />The author is informed by a fataly defective theology.  Rather than understanding that Christianity is the faith that worships and proclaims the risen Christ.  He describes Christianity as &quot;a religion based on the concept of agape, the love that accords  each individual irrespective of difference, equal respect...&quot; (p. 280).  Perhaps, this tendency to reduce the beauty of theology to mere social action explains, in part, the author's open hostility to his subject.  Perhaps, he wished to make the Holy Father into a courageous social worker, rather than one of the chief defenders of the faith.<br />The author approached his task with an historic bias, describing the Nazi holocaust as &quot;the greatest crime in human history&quot; (p. 293), and soundly criticizing the Pope for not doing more to stop it.  Somehow, the author makes his claim, despite the fact that slavery and the black diaspora impacted more lives and has lasted longer than the holocaust.  Somehow, the author makes his claim, despite the virtual elimination of native people from North America.  Surely, Hitler's crimes were horrible, but not necessarily the most awful that the world has ever seen.<br />Too often in this text, history descends into rumor.  Too often, biography becomes innuendo.<br />Despite all of its flaws, this book gives us a glimpse into two tragedies.  That, in itself, is as instructive for us as it was for the ancient Greeks.  First, we see the tragedy of Pope Pius XII: a mere mortal DESTINED to lead his denomination in &quot;interesting times.&quot;  Secondly, we see the tragedy of John Cornwell: an author unable or unwilling to understand his subject.	2001-04-05

Rosamond Johnson, wrote a song for a chorus of five hundred black school children, in Jacksonville, Florida, to sing in celebration of Lincoln's birthday.  The song was originally published by mimeograph, and intended only for that year's remembrance of President Lincoln.  Yet, the black school children of Jacksonville kept singing.  ...and because the song reflected the truth of the black experience in America, the chorus swelled from five hundred to millions of voices.  Today &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; is alternately referred to as the &quot;Black National Anthem&quot;<br />Deeply patriotic, and clinging to a vision of an America healed of the scourge of racism, the brothers Johnson answered Francis Scott Key's anthem with realism, pathos, and hope.  Whereas Key's song speaks of the external, military enemy, the Johnsons' chorus speaks of the more insidious internal enemy of racism.  Whereas Key wrote of liberty already won and now demanding defense, the Johnsons wrote of liberty delayed, eventually promised, seen, but not yet fully acheived.<br />In this anthology, the editors give us an history of this deeply moving piece of music, and a chronology of its authors.  They also give us one hundred short reponses to the song -- almost meditations -- by Americans of every skin hue.  Finally, the text includes a pictoral display of the 20th century, American, black experience which is a treasure in and of itself.<br />This is more than a coffee table book.  This is a book for all Americans to read and re-read: for in this text are planted the seeds of tolerance and understanding which our nation so desperately requires.	2001-03-18

Dr. Martin has provided us with a good, solid, although less than profound, primer on early Christian worship.  This is the right book for high-school-age Sunday School classes, and for adults begin initial studies on the Christian liturgies.  This text is insufficient, however, for more advanced reading.<br />With a well crafted vocabulary, a solid understanding of the subject matter, and an obvious infusion of Dr. Martin's own, deep faith, this is a delightful book.  <br />Its only short-fall is that Dr. Martin paints the image of early Christian unity in faith, doctrine, and practice with too wide a brush.  Thus, we read &quot;The Resurrection is by common consent the decisive element in THE kerygma...&quot; (p. 75, emphasis mine), even though James D.G. Dunn (Unity and Diversity in the New Testament: An Inquiry into the Character of Earliest Christianity, Trinity Press 1990) and others have argued conclusively for multiple kerygmata in the earliest Church.  In fact, for 49 pages (124-173) Dunn demonstrates explicitly and convincingly the complex variety in early Christian worship and sacramental practice.  Martin, on the other hand, paints a rather flat image of an unified Church in which all the faithful believed the same doctrines, adhered to the &quot;Didache,&quot; and smoothed over the differences between the synoptic Gospels, the Gospel according the Saint John, and the Pauline Epistles.<br />Dr. Martin's book is an excellent place to begin a study of the Christian liturgies, especially if the reader remembers that it is only a starting point.	2001-03-11

For the pensive and discerning reader, struggling through Professor Dunn's compact and rich text can be as significant an event, as reading Luther's &quot;Introduction to Romans&quot; turned out to be for Wesley.  Certainly for those of us who attended traditional, conservative and orthodox Christian seminaries, this text can be an eye-opener.  Similarly, for the laity whose spiritual guides graduated from such seminaries, this book can be liberating.<br />Contrary to what many of us learned in seminary (and others have simply assumed through denominational hubris), Dr. Dunn goes to great lengths to demonstrate -- from the canon of the New Testament, itself -- that there is no historically-mandated, one, proper way to be a Christian.  Bishops and Church Councils may declare what they wish to declare, but often those declarations are simply not supported by the experience of the earliest Christians, as recorded in the New Testament.  In one, bold move Professor Dunn minimizes both the teaching magisterium of Rome, and the most confrontive claims of the Protestant traditions.<br />Quoting extensively from Scripture, Professor Dunn demonstrates that: (1) there was not one expression of the Gospel, but several within the earliest Christian communities; (2) the confessional formulae and their settings for proclamation varied; (3) that the concept and structure of ministry varied widely among the earliest Christians; (4) that the structure and practice of worship was not unified; (5) that different Christian communities experienced the Spirit of the living God in different ways; and (6) that while all of the early Christian communities were unified by centering their lives and proclamations around the risen Christ, all of the early Christian communities did not understand the risen Christ in the same way.  In short, Professor Dunn shows us that the earliest Christians were unified in their devotion to the risen Christ, but greatly diverse in the way that they experiencedhis presence among them, and told his story to the world.<br />Living in an era when denominational antagonisms are too often glossed over by a thin veneer of polite ecumenicity, reading Professor Dunn's book can be a humbling experience.

Those with enough knowledge, motivation, and leisure time write the histories that inform the attitudes and opinions of the rest of us.  <br />Unfortunately, the bulk of humanity does not consist of articulate, highly motivated, and independent elites.  Thus, most histories end up biased in favor of society's masters, and against the proletariat.<br />One quick survey of the average New Testament history will demonstrate our fascination with kings (e.g.: Caesar), priests (e.g.: Ananus and Caiaphus), ethnarchs (e.g.: Herod Archelaus), tetrarchs (e.g.: Herod Philip and Herod Antipas), governors (e.g.: Pontius Pilate), prophets (e.g.: John the Baptist), pharisees (e.g.: Paul), sadducees (e.g.: Jonathan, son of Ananus), philosophers (e.g.: Philo of Alexandria), historians (e.g.: Josephus), rabbis (e.g.: Jesus), and other people of note.  Very seldom do we examine the lives of the ordinary people who left little, or no, written records of their experience.  Too quickly our image of first century, Palestinian life becomes colored by the proclaimed experiences of the elites.  Too quickly we forget or dismiss the experiences of the illiterate majority, barely eaking out an existence in a subsistence economy.<br />By focusing his attentions on the miserable lives lived by the majority of the peasants, Professor Horsley gives us a more balanced view of Palestine in the time of Jesus and the earliest Church.  He shows us a peasantry, not only resentful about Roman occupation and taxation, but also deeply distrustful of their own political and sacerdotal institutions.  He shows us subsistence farmers pushed off their land, or ever more deeply into debt, by Roman and Jewish over-taxation.  He places before our eyes people whose lives could end instantly and violently on the whim of a king, governor, or ordinary Roman soldier.  He shows us a people yearning for their ancient and legitimate kings.  He brilliantly paints the picture of a people pushed to the edge of life, and made ready for revolution, whether that be the political revolution of 66 a.d., or the revolutionary preaching of Good News by an itinerant Galilean rabbi.<br />Professor Horsley helps all of us to see first century Palestine more clearly: more honestly.  For that alone, this book is worth reading.	2001-01-21

Thus he instantly enthralls his audience by inter-weaving the lives of one of America's greatest heroes: Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, and an American traitor: Edward Porter Alexander, into one, seamless story.  Golay takes dry, dead history and makes it live, so that the seemingly formidable task of reading 345 pages passes quickly and enjoyably.<br />This is a great book to read if you are looking for a little fun, or if you wish to share information with a friend or family member unfamiliar with the details of America's 19th century, intramural tragedy.<br />However, a double biography is an artificial construct, at best. Golay's choice to tie together the lives of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Edward Porter Alexander emphasizes just how artificial that structure can be.  <br />Chamberlain was a genuine American hero: a civilian academic, past the age when he would have been expected to serve, he rushed to his country's defense at the beginning of the Civil War.  Serving brilliantly, at great personal cost, Chamberlain is creditted by many with turning the Battle of Gettysburg, contributing significantly during the Battle of Five Forks, and beginning the process of national healing with his chivalrous gesture at the Surrender Triangle of Appomattox Court House.<br />Alexander, on the other hand, was a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and a regular Army officer.  Like all regular Army officers, he had sworn &quot;to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.&quot;  In order to participate in the insurrection, he violated his sacred oath: he lied.  The nation expected better of the man, and should have had its expectations fulfilled.<br />In an age when values are, again, viewed as important, we must clearly state that, ultimately, despite the shared battles, hardships, and adventures, the lives of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Edward Porter Alexander were not parallel.  Chamberlain's life is to be emulated, and Alexander's rejected.<br />This book works.  It is simply flawed by its structure.	2000-11-05

Rabbi Wylen is, himself, something of an extraordinarilly ecumenical individual: a Jew occasionally teaching at a Catholic University.  It comes as no surprise, then, that he has written an extraordinarilly ecumenical text.  Reviewing a wide variety of sources Wylen displays an encyclopedic knowledge of Jewish life, law, and practices during the period of the Second Temple.  He firmly places Jesus of Nazareth within the context of normal, first century, Galilean, Jewish experience. <br />Rabbi Wylen's work would seem to be of the greatest value for Christian non-scholars seeking to better understand the circumstances surrounding the earthly life of the one whom they worship.  Rabbi Wylen exposes widely held myths, long promulgated by ignorant preachers (e.g.: the &quot;lex talio&quot; was no longer practiced in the first century), and helps us to better understand particularly difficult passages of the New Testament (e.g.: the Palm Sunday Gospel appears to include practices reserved for Sukkoth).  In the process he more clearly illuminates the Gospel and the uniqueness of Jesus Christ.<br />This is a wonderful book for those who are serious about Biblical scholarship: who do not mind having their assumptions challenged.  If you want to be comfortable, buy another book.  If you want to learn, purchase this one.	2000-09-25

Although normally a positive book reviewer (check-out my other  &quot;Amazon.com&quot; reviews), I must admit that I have long considered  self-help books to be the products of effete snobs, and self-involved  &quot;experts&quot; who seek to have all of us become like them -- or at  least like what they perceive themselves to be.  Dr. Maxwell's latest  effort although full of truisms, good advice, wonderful stories, and even  humor has done nothing to change my mind.	2000-09-07

However, since the goal of this or any other academic text is truth  rather than novelty, the book is still quite useful.  In those first five  chapters, Segal more than adequately summarizes the curricula of many a  good undergraduate survey of religion, or comparative religion course.<br />The material that Professor Segal presents on Palestinian cultures,  politics, the life and message of Jesus of Nazareth, the role of Paul of  Tarsus, and the ascendancy of rabbinical Judaism is not new.  However, he  does bring all that material together in one book that forms a handy  reference for any would-be Biblical or Talmudic scholar.<br />Professor  Segal's most valuable contribution occurs in the last two chapters of his  book, where he demonstrates that rabbinical Judaism and Christianity are  (fraternal) twin religions born of the same political, social, and  religious stimuli.  Facing the crises of the wars of independence begun in  66 and 132 c.e., and their consequences, the religious and political  systems which centered on the temple at Jerusalem were no longer viable.  Thus, Christianity (which in many ways was still a Jewish sect) traveled  one road to survival, while rabbinical Judaism took another.  The result  was two different religions.  Nevertheless, Professor Segal does well to  remind us that those religions were born of one mother: historical,  pre-rabbinical, temple-centered Judaism.<br />Because Segal's claim is true,  it is incumbent upon all Christians and Jews to realize that the  differences between them are not schisms between  believers and infidels,  but a continuing discussion within the household of faith.	2000-09-06

Not since Schweitzer, has the world seen such a powerful reconstruction of the historical Jesus of Nazareth!  Schweitzer's efforts were tainted by his  strong Christian faith, and his tendency to see the apocalyptic in all of  Jesus' thoughts and teachings.  Vermes, on the other hand, gives us an  intellectually more honest, less influenced, vision of the Galilean rabbi,  whom many of us continue to worship twenty centuries after his public  execution for sedition.<br />In the first three chapters of this book, Vermes  draws upon contemporary documents to clearly draw his picture of Jesus, the  Jew, the Galilean, and the Hasid.  The result is an image freed from the  theological meditations of Saint Paul and the nascent Church, which recast  the Jesus of history into the Christ of faith.<br />In the next five chapters  of his book, Vermes brilliantly examines some of the many titles given to  Jesus, distinguishing between those that would have been used by Jesus, or  others, in his own life time, and those imposed upon him after the  crucifixion by the Church that worshipped him.<br />Vermes' work should be  mandatory reading for any serious student of the New Testament.  If you are  a believer, it will, occasionally, infuriate you.  If you are a skeptic,  you may find Vermes to be &quot;too soft&quot; on the traditional faith.   ...but no matter what your faith, you will learn.	2000-08-27
US	51869166	R3JGJAO17RV3IN	0800627970	862103069	The Religion of Jesus the Jew	Books	5	84	86	N	N	The Quest for the Historical Jesus Continues	Albert Schweitzer did not initiate the academic quest for the historical Jesus, nor did he end it.  Schweitzer was, however, its most famous  proponent.  Second only to Schweitzer, Geza Vermes has, justifiably, become  the penultimate voice of scholarship in this endeavor.  Schweitzer  demonstrated the importance of the apocalyptic to the historical Jesus.  In  his 1973 tour de force, &quot;Jesus The Jew,&quot; Vermes emphasized Jesus'  existence as a Galilean, Hasidic Jew.  In this work, he firmly places Jesus  within first century, Palestinian Jewish religious tradition.  The result  of Schweitzer's and Vermes' combined works is a less romanticized, less  theologized, and more believable earthly Jesus.  Although this book will  disturb those who are comfortable with unquestioned piety, it is an  invaluable tool for serious Bible students.  It digs below the theology of  the early Church to get a better view of the historical Jesus of  Nazareth.<br />Vermes describes Jesus as an observant, first century Jew,  whose behavior was very much like that of other observant, first century  Jews.  He shows us how Jesus' teachings relied upon bibical and charismatic  authority.  He shows how speaking in proverbs and parables was not a way  for Jesus to obscure his message from all but the elect, but was rather a  way to illustrate his teachings.  He describes Jesus' preaching as closely  related to the work of his rabbinical contemporaries.  Perhaps most  striking of all, he proves that Jesus' address of God as &quot;Abba&quot;  was not unique.<br />Vermes shows that the religion of Jesus, the exorcist,  the preacher, and the friend of pariahs was authentically Jewish.  It was  the early (largely gentile) Church, as it theologically reflected upon his  life and death, which transformed that faith from Judaism to Christianity.   In the end, the reader is left indebted to Vermes for his scholarship, yet  still responsible to make one's own decision regarding the Lordship of  Jesus, the Christ.	2000-08-23

The Rev. Anderson need not worry about that punishment.  In fact, the  title of his book is a bit deceptive: This is not &quot;The Gospel  According to Disney,&quot; nor is it a theological treatise of any sort.   Rather, it is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as seen in bits and pieces,  through the work of Walt Disney, et al.        In each of the 20 short  chapters, Anderson lays out a sermon illustration, Sunday School or  Vacation Bible School lesson, as seen in one of Disney's films or leading  characters.       The book is amusing, engaging, and restates the  unchanging Gospel of Jesus Christ in a fresh way that is easily grasped by  a modern audience.       If there is any short fall to this valuable little  book it is that the book can be a bit short on divine grace, and very long  on perfectionism at some points.  Ironically, sometimes (despite the title)  rather than appealing to the Gospel, Anderson appeals to the Law.        ...but a book that includes maxims, morals and ethical teachings is still a  valuable text.  Especially, when paired with opportunities to view the  original films, this book can be a wonderful teaching tool for parents,  Sunday School teachers, Vacation Bible School teachers, divinity students  and clergy.	2000-07-27

The subtitle of Alexander and Preston's book is &quot;Claiming God's Grace for Lesbians and Gays.&quot;  Nevertheless, this is not a book for homosexuals.  This is a book that raises important theological and  liturgical questions for all of God's people.  Reduced to their simplest  forms the question are: &quot;DOES the Church tell the truth about those  who are different?&quot; and if not, &quot;CAN the Church tell the truth  about those who are different?&quot;<br />     Cutting through the  psycho-babble and well-intentioned but destructive, liberal, social  thinking, Alexander and Preston quickly get to the heart of the matter: (1)  some denominations baptize infants and young children, boldly declaring  that what matters is not our decision for Jesus, but his decision for us;  (2) a growing body of scientific evidence argues for a significant genetic  component to homosexuality, but (3) despite the commitment that  denominations make in infant baptisms and a growing body of scientific  evidence for sexual predispositions, most congregations effectively  excommunicate homosexuals.  The point is simple: every time the Church  chases away an homosexual, we sin. <br />     In the face of our religious  hypocracy and failure to keep the promises of infant baptism, Alexander and  Preston calmly remind us, &quot;We Were Baptized, Too.&quot;  This  thought-provoking argument demands to be read and discussed within the  &quot;straight&quot; Church.  Can we tell the truth about those who share  our faith, but whose ways of loving are different from our own?	2000-07-27

Not everything can be achieved, not every wrong can be righted simply because the international community desires it.   We cannot suddenly rebuild failed states or failing territories in our  own image...&quot;  With those powerful words, near the very end of his  epilogue, Shawcross clearly states his thesis: there are limits to power.   Limits which, in the post-Cold War world, we have not, yet, learned how to  successfully manage.<br />In the preceeding 412 pages, Shawcross details the  impotence of international diplomacy and peacekeeping.  Calling forth the  heart-breaking litany of Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia, Chechnya, Congo,  East Timor, Guinea, Haiti, Iraq, Kosovo, Liberia, Libia, Rwanda, Sierra  Leone, Somalia, and Uganda, Shawcross reminds us that the world community:  (1) idealistically sought to end each of those horrors, and (2) inevitably  found itself powerless to significantly change circumstances for the  better. <br />While Shawcross' description is undoubtably correct, he fails to  offer a prescription for the situation in which the world finds itself  since the fall of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.  Thus his book ends  up being little more than a descent into hopelessness.  <br />Shawcross would  have more positively contributed to the debate if he had followed the  example of Colin Powell, and others, who have clearly stated under what  circumstances they believe international intervention to be warrented and  useful.  As it is, Mr. Shawcross has left us nothing to debate or ponder.   He has merely served as the deliverer of bad news.	2000-04-09
