A marvelous collection of short stories.<BR>I enjoyed it even more than his outstanding novel,&quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;.<BR>Each of these slices of life caused me to recognize the truth of the interactions and the ultimate problems of human communication. As Richard Russo notes in his introduction, Yates focuses on our dreams and aspirations; mostly to be frustrated by the reality of day to day living. I rate this a &quot;must read&quot;.	2003-07-16

A Studs Terkel-like verbal history of the role of the talent agency in Hollywood; with a particular focus on the Mailroom where the movers and shakers get their start. The book is a never ending compilation of interviews with the men who made it after paying their dues in the servitude of the Mail Room. For those in the industry it is probably fascinating lore. For me, it was one big bore.	2003-07-04

He projects the frustrations inherent in living a life where there is no level playing field, with little chance that this will change. He does not hit you with a mallet, but grabs your heart and your mind; as you read you feel the sorrow and the rage. And for a moment, you have a dim understanding of this &quot; us and them &quot; quandary. <br />I believe this to be a classic; not to be accepted lightly or forgotten easily.	2003-06-11

Admittedly, there are passages of remarkable insight, but enormous amounts of time are devoted to the author's obsessions with parturition, infant development, <BR>pale sexuality, and show-offy displays of her academic credentials in literature. I kept hoping for some original thoughts and theories of human behavior, but was disappointed and bored. Much of this material has been explored before and with greater skill and intelligence. <br />As I moved from page to page it reminded me of slogging through the swamps of Mississippi, on bivouac, back in 1945.

But, the essence of the book, dealing with the lives and thoughts of mid 19th century intellectuals. was engrossing. <br />Menand structures his narrative in such a way that the reader can grasp the major themes on which the central figures focused.<BR>I was shocked by the pervasive racism and parochial religiosity of these Great Men. Political correctness in that era would not even try to wash in the late 20th century. The story of the 3 black med students being driven out of Harvard by their peers and the fact that Harvard did not accept a woman to its med school until 1945 were astounding revelations<br />I was also impressed by the false pseudo scientific hypotheses which were accepted as gospel by many. And used as rationalization for passive prejudice and government action.<BR>We have come a long way since then. <br />While admiring much that Holmes, James, Pierce et al contributed I left feeling somewhat disappointed in their narrow vision.<br />Certainly, I recommend this volume. It stimulates thought and provides significant knowledge about the era.	2002-01-24

The author digs deeper and paints with a broader brush than the play. <br />Her command of the English language is outstanding. She is non judgemental, but is consistently sympathetic to the problems of the Gay Community and of all minority groups. The book combines an overview of the facts with close scrutiny of the attitudes and opinions of the major players in this classic tragedy.<br />She is careful to avoid sweeping conclusions vis a vis the final affect of Mathew's death. I may seem cynical but nothing changes in this arena. Hate survives. My advice to all minorities:<BR>Be vigilant, stay strong, be prepared to retaliate, and stand tall. The Fred Phelps types are pitiful and beyong contempt.<br />Incidentally, I am a straight grandfather; been around for 75 years.	2001-09-14

I found much of the material to be revealing of the methodology used by rich and poor to escape the responsibility of paying ones dues.<BR>The authors lost me in their attack on VAT ( National Sales Tax ) which has worked successfully in tne United Kingdom and in Canada. These countries are way ahead of us in Social Services. Any tax plan will have its defects, but this is one way to avoid the off shore plans, and the refusal to even submit the 1040 form.<BR>The final chapter devoted to the authors' solution to the problem is a joke. If you take one suggestion after another it is clear that our economy will not tolerate their badly constructed cure. I think that they were just in a hurry to close out the book and had really ill considered, ( or no ), advice from seasoned economists. These two chapters left me with a feeling of let down and disappointment. I had hoped to find some well constructed answers to a pernicious problem. But they offered none.	2001-09-04

They are always at war with their mothers. Never find any redeeming features in either of their parents. This is pretty tired and unoriginal stuff in my view.<br />Her short stories/novella, &quot; Another Marvelous Thing &quot; does it a bit better.

It is an essay on &quot;letting go&quot; and on facing death. Sex is a metaphor for life; as it has always been for Roth. Perhaps, if I were younger, I may have missed the point. David's battle with depression is the war we all fight as seniors. And Roth's never ending struggle with the concept of committment has been an recurring theme throughout his career. It is true that he comes back to these themes many times, but he does so with great skill and creative talent.

It does not. Throughout, the author is feeling sorry for herself. She took on a problematic adoption, and seems totally unprepared to face the truth. People, the world over, are racist, or sexist, or religionist. In-group, out-group mind set is part of the human genetic makeup. Look at Africa; look at the middle east; look at Ireland. <br />And blacks are as racist as the whites. Maybe more so, today.  White attempts to bridge the gap are rebuffed. Snide remarks by blacks about &quot;liberal&quot; whites are hurtful too.<br />In addition, I think the professor has bent over backwards looking for racism. Some of her attacks on well meaning educators resulted in negative consequences to her child. I think that she might be labeled as paranoid in some of her accusations.<br />The long critique of &quot; color blindness &quot; is absurd. It is the ideal to which we should aspire.<br />Finally, Dr.Rush, I think you are doing your daughter more harm than good with this inflammatory screed.	2001-05-05

I come down at the 1 star level, but would not label it trash.<br />Rather, I question the validity of the story line from beginning to end. If Knowles  intended symbolism the obvious interpretation of the Cain and Abel story is  so heavy handed as to be laughable.<br />I lived through that period in time,  at the age of the leading characters, who would now be in their seventies.  Their attitude toward WW 2 is totally off base, and doesn't reflect the  feelings of my contemporaries or me at that time.<br />The falling from the  tree premise is articial and strains credulity.
