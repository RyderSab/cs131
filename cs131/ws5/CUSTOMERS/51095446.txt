Similar to Mitford in it's southern writing feel, and the small town, where everybody knows everyone, like Mitford it is also a feel good book. However, this is not a Mitford knock-off, it has a completely different writing style that stands on it's own. To me it seemed like a blend of At Home in Mitford and Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarden.<br />Each chapter can be read as it's own short story, but they build upon one another, completing a picture of life in Harmony. Told in the first person by a Quaker pastor, Home to Harmony is a delightful, charming read about small town life. There are many laugh out loud moments, solid Christian roots, and real perspective on how we should all approach life. Harmony is a town that shouldn't be passed over, but savored with an extended stay~	2003-04-19

Broken into 3 sections, representing each of his wives, the reader gets to meet and despise the man who is Ken Kimble.  It is interesting to see how the same man relates as a husband to three very different yet similarily seduced women.<br />At the onset, Ken Kimble seems like a caring, sensitive man, tapping in to each wives weaknesses, saying the things that comfort them and reel them in. Then after marriage, he becomes distant, selfish, deceitful. Jennifer Haigh does a great job of portraying women in all forms-weak, pathetic, vulnerable, strong, resilient. Her cast of characters, both the wives as well as the children who result from his trilogy of marriages are strong, well-defined characters. The writing of this novel is excellent-the pages will fly by in one sitting. Mrs. Kimble has a creative plot and solid writing. I look forward to more from Jennifer Haigh.	2003-04-07

I love any books that center around a group of women and their friendships. Unfortunately, I was left somewhat disappointed with this novel. It did have its cute moments and it wasn't bad, but I didn't finish the last page loving it, like I did Patty Jane. Each chapter starts out with a different character who is hosting the Angry Housewives book club, lists what book she has selected and the reason it was chosen, which I thought was a cute touch. I think the reason I didn't love it was that none of the characters really grabbed me. Each of the five women had a very distinct personality, and their struggles were ones that I think women everywhere can relate to, but there wasn't anything overly unique about them other then their stereotypes.  I don't mind reading something that's been done before, but didn't find anything unique that really grabbed me with any of these women. I still adore Lorna Landvik and will eagerly await anything else she writes. The writing was excellent, I just didn't fall in love with the story.	2003-03-25

Realizing that these two novels are not his normal genre, I am not comparing them to his other works. Wish You Well is a cute, entertaining read that is a southern tale of life living in the Virginia mountains.<br />The story centers around two children, Lou and her little brother Oz, who find themselves living with their great grandmother, Louisa May Cardinal, after being in a tragic accident. Meeting Louisa for the first time, the children have to adapt to a completely different way of life, coming from New York City, to a small, rural place that contains no electricity, running water or any modern day convenience.<br />Baldacci does a good job of painting the image of mountain life, it's inhabitant's struggles, trials and tribulations.

I think Jill Bialosky has true talent as a writer as she succinctly captures the emotions and pains that her characters experience.  I think the negative to this book is that all it is about is a huge cycle of dysfunction, which some may find rather depressing and the ending left me somewhat unsatisfied. That aside, it was an easy and entertaining book to read, the writing was well done, and I would certainly read other books by this author.	2003-02-02

Leading the parishoners of St. Cecilia's is Father James, who learns that St. Cecilia's doors will be closed due to lack of funds. Heart-broken, Father James is distressed at what will happen to his St. Cecilia's family, who rely on the church and their friendships there, to get through life's struggles.<br />Katherine Valentine is a gifted writer, though her style is simple, it is wonderfully easy to read, and creates a true warmth and feeling of comfort. Even though it did seem a lot like the Mitford series, it was still creative in the story lines, entertaining and insightful. For those with Christian roots, it provides some strong messages of faith &amp; hope.	2003-01-30

The girls will go through some more ups and downs, but their friendships will help them prevail.<br />Along Came Mary also introduces us to two new characters Mary Madigan &amp; Rotten Rick. The only disappointment I felt while reading Along Came Mary was that the majority of the book seemed to focus on Maddy &amp; Rick, instead of the girls at the flower farm. I enjoyed Bad Girl Creek a little more for this reason, as I loved the focus of Nance, Phoebe, Ness &amp; Beryl that Bad Girl Creek had. Despite this, Mapson still maintains her gift for writing, and has you feeling all of the joys and pains that her characters go through, as if they were actually happening to you or your closest friend.

This was my first novel by Michael Malone &amp; I found his writing style to be wonderful, entertaining and easy to read, as well as discriptive and moving.<br />The story begins with 7 year old Kaye intruding upon Noni one wintery, snowy night, where they journey out into the freshly fallen snow and take off on Noni's new beautiful red sled with her name engraved upon it. Thus begins a lasting yet tumultuous friendship between the two. The Last Noel is written quite creatively, as the novel spans 12 different Christmases at various points in Kaye &amp; Noni's lives. At their homes of Clayhome &amp; Heaven's Hill you will meet many lovable characters. The story spans the relationship of Noni &amp; Kaye as they struggle to love one another at the right times and in the right ways. There is also an undercurrent of racial tension, but the heart of the story lies with this loving yet frustrating couple. <br />The Last Noel is a cozy and moving story that will stay with me~	2003-01-02

The imagery that Jan Karon paints is picture perfect, with streets named Lilac Lane &amp; Old Church Road, and the local diner, The Grill, where the townfolk gather and catch up on the latest goings on.<br />Mitford is the ideal of small town, southern life. It is here that Father Tim lives &amp; breathes, where he is the pastor of a small parish. For the past 12 years, without a vacation or break, Father Tim has nourished his congregation while neglecting himself. Little does he realize how a new neighbor, a little boy, and a faithful dog will come into town and change his life.  Mitford has a cast of wonderful, colorful characters and the pace is just right for the simplicity and loveliness of Mitford. This is not a book if you're looking for action, but if you like warm and cozy reads, this book is a must. I can't wait to read the rest of the series~	2002-12-30

Rose the smart sister is a successful lawyer, who has her own great apartment &amp; the best shoe collection around, while Maggie, who is beautiful, can't seem to get her life together. Constantly taking advantage of Rose, In Her Shoes explores the dynamics of the two sister's relationships and how they find a way to make peace with one another. Weiner also covers the importance of family in our lives. As she did in her first novel, Weiner provides a lot of substance as well as an entertaining read~	2002-12-20

It looked like a fun holiday read. When I first started reading it, the writing did seem sort of elementary, but once I allowed myself to get into the story more, the pages flew by fast &amp; I found it to be an entertaining read. Baldacci does paint a cozy setting aboard a train, as people are headed towards their Christmas destinations. The Christmas Train isn't deep, but it is an entertaining and fast read. The story is a combo of a love story/a bit of a mystery/and a history of the train system. If you take it for what it is, a purely fun &amp; entertaining light read you may end up enjoying it. It was a perfect read for the hoidays.	2002-12-20

What I loved about Zippy is that it was such an easy read, written in simple language, but yet observant &amp; well written. I found The Solace of Leaving Early to be an entirely different writing style, that at times was tough to read. Kimmel is a very talented writer, and she did create two very quirky characters who the novel centers around; Langston Braverman &amp; Amos, the local pastor.  Both Langston &amp; Amos, unknowingly are facing many of the same struggles, but yet, can't seem to stand each other. Kimmel takes us down a path of realization as these two characters struggle with the circumstances they unwillingly find themselves in. Issues of guilt, finding your calling, and unconditional love are explored. Do not read The Solace of Leaving Early expecting another Zippy as they are two totally different types of writing. Even though I didn't love Solace, it's still clear that Kimmel is a talented writer, and I look forward to more of her works.	2002-12-03

Lin gets to experience small town life once again, and her story unfolds as she mixes with a cast of zany characters and gets mixed up in the local small town politics & scandals. Queen Bee of Mimosa Branch had a lot of potential, and had it's cute moments, but overall I felt it was lacking in character development. The story was an easy read and the writing was good, I just couldn't identify with the main character as much as I hoped.	2002-11-22

It still is a fast, entertaining read, but the characters were not as likeable as her previous novel. <br />What is good about Fishbowl, is that it is a fresh approach to the chick lit books that are out there right now. While it does have the girl wants guy theme, it is not center to the story line like most chick lit books. Instead, the novel focuses on the relationship between these 3 very different roommates, Allie, Jodine &amp; Emma.<br />The girls are bonded when they need to come up with money making schemes to pay for their apartment kitchen which burned down. The story is told in alternating chapters between the three roommates and a &quot;narrator.&quot; During the narrator chapters, the author is talking directly to the reader, like she's having a one on one conversation with you, which I was not a huge fan of.<BR>Mlynowski definitely has talent as a writer..she did keep me entertained, and it was easy reading, I was just not as impressed with this one as Milk Run. I'm still a fan and would continue to read other works by her~	2002-11-04

Sela Ward's love for the south resounds in every page, as she strives to balance her Hollywood life with the simplicity and charm of the Mississippi life that grounds her.<br />Sela Ward seems to be a truly down to earth, loving &amp; caring person &amp; she lets the reader in to her life through a history of her family, and her own personal ups and downs. It is very evident how much she loves her family, and what is truly important to her.

The first half of the novel takes place while their father is away, serving in the war. Each sister has a distinct personality, a reader, an artist, a musician, the quiet one. You will get to know this family in touching little stories of their daily life. Each chapter seems to set up a moral lesson for the reader to learn. We also meet a wonderful set of neighbors, Mr. Laurence and his nephew \\"Laurie\\" who quickly find a place as part of the March family.<br />The second half of the novel, focuses on the girls as they leave their childhood and begin their journey into adult life. Lessons of friendship, family, and love are covered as we join the characters through the ups and downs of life, good times and bad. It seems that Louisa May Alcott used her own family as the basis for the stories in Little Women, basing the character Jo on herself. It is amazing how though the book was written in the late 1800's, so many things about humans remain the same. The foundations of life that are important in friendships, family & love don't change through time, as Alcott has shared with us. This is a book that young and old can read and appreciate.	2002-10-25

As the story develops we see how a reclusive old widow with a lot of money, and a poor uneducated handyman with a bad rap, are brought together in the most unusual of circumstances.

Set in Mooreland, Indiana, we get to see what small town life is like for Zippy during her childhood years. The book is full of laugh out loud moments, with Zippy and her crazy antics. At times I thought that Zippy seemed a real life version of Ramona Quimby, the star of Beverly Cleary's beloved childrens books.<br />A few have critiqued  the cover of the book, but I thought it was cute, and I loved that each chapter started with an old family photo. Some have criticized the book for having issues with the family...like their dirty house, gambling dad, having a gun in the house, or her lack of desire to go to church, but Kimmel has done a great job of focusing on the good in both her family and her life, and finding a way to see humor in some of the not so good. I really appreciated her perspective and that she shared her childhood memories with us in such a funny &amp; delightful way. I also adored the ending of the book, if you like feeling good about life, read this~	2002-09-30

As a recommendation from my brother, the cover didn't really look like a book I would normally read. What a gift to discover, that between the cover was a magical, entertaining and touching story.<br />Boy's Life is told from the perspective of 11 year old Cory. Riding with his father, one early, dark morning, on his dad's milk route, Cory and his father find themselves witnesses to a horrible accident. For Cory's father, this turn of events, leaves a scar, that shakes his world and disrupts his life. Through this incident, a mystery of sorts begins in the novel. In the midst of this, we also get a day to day look into Cory's life, dealing with the town bullies, and the antics of what a typical little boy's life is like growing up. Set in southern Alabama, Boy's Life is like a cross between To Kill a Mockingbird and the movie Stand by Me. What you get is a cast of wonderful, colorful characters, a little southern fiction, a little mystery, some racial tensions, and an endearing coming of age story. Boy's Life has found a place on my list of all time favorites.	2002-09-24

What could possibly bring these two very different women into each other's lives & make them friends?<br />Entering Normal is a story of motherhood, friendship, loss, and relationships, about the ups and downs of life, and how we find the strength to keep on going. The writing was well done, this is an easy read, and the pages turn quickly. However, the character development and plot line were only mediocre at times. This was an entertaining read, but I wasn't wow-ed by the end. I think LeClaire has talent as a writer, and I will try reading some of her other works.

Eliza is a likable main character, who you can't help but root for, as she longs for the attention &amp; love of her father, and family.<BR>After the first quarter of the novel, however, the story takes a different direction, as it focuses more on religion and mystical themes, then it does on Eliza and her spelling bee. The story becomes somewhat bizarre and the ending is also somewhat unsatisfying. Goldberg certainly has a talent for writing, but the story fizzled out for me. I would have enjoyed it more, had she kept the story focused on Eliza and less on different religious themes. I thought I was getting a story about a little girl and a spelling bee, and ended up with an exploration of religious themes. Again, the writing is good, but the story a let-down.	2002-09-07

It may be helpful to read The Cape Ann first as you get a better understanding of one of the characters, Lark,  and her mother, but it is not essential. It is interesting to read The Empress of One, and glaze over some of the same incidents from The Cape Ann from a different perspective.<br />Sullivan's writing is wonderful.  She has a great ability to take you back to the old days of small town life, when everybody knew everyone and day to day life was more community centered. The Empress of One is the coming of age story of Sally, a little girl who grows up with a mother who is deemed &quot;crazy&quot;, but as we know today would be described as clinically depressed. It's both interesting and sad to see how society back in the day, dealt with some heavy issues, such as mental illness, compared to the strides we've made today. Sullivan will have you so familiar with the quaintness of Harvester and it's townfolk, you'll feel like it's your own home town as well. My only complaint is that she did leave a lot of unanswered questions and loose ends. If she ties those up in another novel, there won't be any complaints~	2002-09-02

We also meet several other members of the Cold Springs community, Bobby a highschool senior, who deeply desires to be a part of the war effort, the apple of his eye, Dixie, Bobby's family, and a few other side characters.  Wood has a real gift for writing, her descriptions are excellent-you can picture each scene perfectly in your mind. Through Grace, we learn how the effects of the war turn life upside down in this small, close-knit community. As you follow the character's lives, you will see what their motivations and deepest desires are, how they all want to be accepted and understood in different forms and different ways. The story was entertaining, but not something that left much of an impression on me. To the author's credit, the writing was excellent (5 stars).	2002-08-24

The once booming and flourishing mills, owned by the prominent Whiting family, have been deserted. There are two types of people in Empire Falls-the ones that have been born and raised there, and continue to gruel away at mundane jobs, and those that left, got an education and came back. <br />The heart of Empire Falls is the fantastic character development that Russo accomplishes in his 483 pages. The novel centers around Miles Roby, a man who did leave Empire Falls briefly, for a few years of college, but came back when his mother Grace fell ill, and found himself permanently displaced as the manager of the Empire Grill. This position maintains his relationship with the town money controller-Mrs. Francine Whiting, who not only controls Empire Grill, but most everything else in the town as well.  You'll learn about Miles through his relationships with his wife/ex-wife Janine, their teenage daughter Tick, and his brother David, along with a cast of colorful townfolk who are quirky and real. There are too many distinct characters to name them all, but in each you'll identify someone you know with the same traits. The story has some twists and turns between current events and flashbacks, that unfold some long hidden secrets.<br />My only issue with Empire Falls was the ending, which didn't seem to maintain the heart of the first 3/4 of the novel. The ending did seem rushed, and more like the ending to a movie, then to a well-drawn out novel.  If you like books that focus on character development more so than action, I think you will like this book. Even though I was discouraged by the ending, it is still a wonderful piece of writing and deserves praise for that alone.	2002-08-15

The only thing from Avonlea that will be at Redmond, is dear old chum Gilbert Blythe. The question is, will Anne & Gilbert finally get together, or will Anne continue to maintain her \\"only friends\\" status?  Montgomery teases the reader with little incidents, and hope is created, that this couple we love will get together at last.<br />Amazing in Montgomery's writing is the discovery of how much and how little college years of L.M.Montgomery's time compare with those of our modern day.  Though times are surely more old fashioned-where gentleman callers visit during certain hours, and no dorms are co-ed, some things never seem to change. When Anne achieves a certain accomplishment, her friend calls out..\\"Let's go get drunk!\\"   Anne of the Island takes an entertaining look at Anne leaving her childhood years behind and enjoying those life changing 4 years that college brings.

The first page tells us, from  first person narrative, that her name is Susie Salmon & on a certain December day, she was murdered while walking home from school. So begins the story of Susie Salmon's murder. The rest is a look at how the Salmon family & the rest of the community cope with this horrible tragedy. On the flip-side we get to see, what Heaven looks like to Susie. Not only is the story line incredibly unique, the writing is excellent. Sebold seems to take a look at all of the supernatural things that people talk about after a person's death, and offer up unique explanations. More importantly though, the story centers on watching how the Salmon family copes, imperfectly, at one of the most devastating losses, that of a child. A true page-turner, The Lovely Bones is about family, love and the afterlife.	2002-08-02

Capote does an outstanding job of telling a<BR>horrific, true story while writing it to read like a fictional novel.  Capote introduces us to the town of Holcomb, Kansas, a place where people don't lock their doors and everybody knows everyone. You will be introduced to each member of the Clutter family & learn how much they were liked and respected in their community. In alternating chapters, you will also meet the two killers, Dick Hickock, and Perry Smith. The murders are disturbing and horrifying, and the heartlessness with which<BR>they are done is unthinkable. <br />Apparently, Capote traveled to Holcomb, Kansas to do research for writing this book. He has been criticized by some as being biased in his views as he befriended the two killers, and some claim Capote lost his objectivity. The book was written as an anti-capital punishment stance, but it isn't the focus of the story. Instead, it is a look at both sides of a horrible crime, from all angles. The truth is chilling and as they say, in this case, truth is stranger than fiction.	2002-08-02

Montgomery IS The Story Girl	It's no wonder that the lady who has gifted us with the Anne of Green Gables series created a character referred to as The Story Girl, one who could transport her audience to a far-away, magical place through the gift of storytelling.<br />As a huge fan of Anne of Green Gables, discovering that The Story Girl was Lucy Maude Montgomery's personal favorite of the works she had written, I anxiously began The Story Girl. It is the charming story of Sara Stanley, the Story Girl, who lives in Carlisle, with her cousins and the hired boy Peter. Told from the perspective of Beverly King, who has moved to Carlisle with his pudgy brother Felix, while their widowed father is  working in a foreign land, Beverly and Felix become enchanted with their new life, hanging out with The Story Girl, beautiful cousin Felicity, sweet, endearing cousin Cecily, practical cousin Dan, and the hired boy Peter.<br />Though Peter is not family, his hard-working, considerate, loyal personality make the rest of the cousins slowly<BR>but surely come to accept him as part of the group. One can't help but wonder if L.M. Montgomery IS the real life Story Girl, one who is well known in Carlisle for being the most magnificent storyteller around. Her magical gift of telling stories captivates her audience, both adults and children.  Her  stories combined with all sorts of amusing antics the children get into compromise the heart of this novel.  The kids will have you in stitches, as they come up with a contest to see who can deliver the best preacher's sermon and the lengths they will go to for coming up with schemes to see who can have the best, most vivid dreams. As always, Montgomery is able to deliver a timeless classic that is wholesome, yet just as powerfully moving <BR>and entertaining nearly a century later. It is written that Montgomery was quite sad to say goodbye to these characters as she completed the last page, and it is no wonder that the reader is left feeling quite the same way. Fortunately,  the stories go on in the sequel, The Golden Road.	2002-06-17

In True to Form, we are delightfully reunited with little Katie Nash, the main character from two of Berg's other outstanding novels, Durable Goods & Joy School.  Berg does not disappoint as she brings us back into Katie's life, reminding us of what it's like to be a kid again, and the thoughts and feelings that accompany the coming of age process. Through Katie, Berg shows us not only how  much insight she has, but also how truly talented her gift is. Her writing is simple, yet powerful and moving. Her words will take you back to the days when  life consisted of school, friends, and parents.<br />In True to Form, Katie Nash is a 13 year-old girl, trying to figure out who she really is and what she stands for.<BR>Dealing with the death of her mother several years prior, Katie has been raised by a very stern father, who<BR>has a difficult time showing emotion. Fortunately, he is now married to Ginger, who is a mother figure &friend to Katie. When Katie's dad announces that she has two jobs for the summer, babysitting the Wexler kids and helping to care for elderly Mrs.Randolph, Katie is less than thrilled. Little does she know how meaningful these experiences will prove to be. Thrown into the mix, Katie discovers what it is that makes a true friend, and the price of popularity. <br />In one of  Berg's most powerful passages, Katie is describing her drawer, where she keeps things that are special to her. \\"...I have red lipstick that was my mother's, with the mark of her mouth on it. I have a rhinestone button I found outside, feathers from birds, pennies that mean good luck. I have a box of crayons that I never intend to use, I just like to look at them all perfect and read the names of the colors out loud, and I like to smell them deep, like I smell the test papers<BR>that have just come off the mimeograph machine. I have some torn-out hairdos that I would like to get, if my hair will ever grow really long instead of acting paralyzed. Sometimes I think, What if I died and someone looked into my drawer? I wonder what they would understand about me. Probably not so much-for one thing<BR>they would get the crayons wrong. I think, actually, that none of us understands anyone else very well, because we're all too shy to show what matters most. If you ask me, it's a major design flaw. We ought to be able to say, Here, look what I am.\\"-So open up True to Form & learn who Katie Nash is. You might even discover a little bit more about yourself. I know I did.	2002-06-01

Though we know the ultimate outcome from the Bridges of Madison County, in A Thousand Country Roads, we get to go back into Robert Kincaid's life and see what roads he travelled after his life changing experience in Madison County, Iowa. Did Robert Kincaid ever get <BR>over his love for Francesca & find happiness? Was his life one fulfilled or one left with unrealized dreams?<br />Waller warns the reader in the beginning, that A Thousand Country Roads is a book that most likely cannot stand on it's own, but should be read as an epilogue to Bridges of Madison County. Going forward and backward in time throughout the novella, we get to see both a Robert Kincaid pre-Francesca as well as what happened to the post-Francesca man who left the woman he loved to stay with her husband and family. Waller takes us through some interesting events in Kincaids life, but at times the story got too bogged down with details of Kincaids photographs instead of focusing on the feelings and thoughts of Kincaid. I wanted more of who this character was, what his heart and mind were thinking, and less about the ins and<BR>outs of his photography.  Perhaps it was intentional on the author's part, as photography was who Robert<BR>Kincaid was. A man of few words, who kept to himself and enjoyed being out in the great wide open. For fans who enjoyed Bridges of Madison County, A Thousand Country Roads provides a nice rounding out to some unanswered questions, but it wasn't quite as satisfying as I'd hoped.	2002-05-30

Now living with Chloe on a much smaller income than either of them are used to, life is not the same as it was back in California. Chloe's days of waitressing and horse training are over, as she embraces the reality of being a parent and coming to terms with what this relationship with Hank amounts to.

Ultimately, Chloe must decide between a stable and steadfast love or one of pure passion and unexplainable force.  In Loving Chloe the reader is asked to examine all of the angles of a love triangle and how to make sense of it. It also asks if unconventional solutions can work and be accepted, and what are the affects? The novel also takes a glimpse into parent/child relationships and how they affect who we become as adults, and what we pass on to our children.  While the ending may be considered somewhat unrealistic or unsatisfying, it does leave the reader with lots to think about and ponder~	2002-05-25

The cover is so pretty and the dust jacket description of a coming of age story in a small town set my expectations high.<br />In Off Keck Road we get the glimpse into two lives-those of Bea and Shelley. In Bea's life we see someone who grew up a child of wealth, who left small town life for a brief period, but ultimately returns to her home town, where she ends up caring for her mother until her final days. A successful career woman, Bea has mastered one area of her life, but found another area without nurturing, for Bea is alone. Shelley, on the other hand, has fallen into an odd working situation with an older man and seems to struggle more with her identity and what she is looking for in love. The characters are loosely tied by the men they love or have thought about loving, but the lines are fuzzy.<BR>As new characters were introduced, I had a hard time of keeping track of who was who, and was left wanting to know more about the characters. I don't feel I ever got more than a tiny glimpse. I feel the story had promise, but never really took off. This will not prevent me from reading more by Simpson, however, as I adored Anywhere but Here and do believe that Simpson has true talent as a writer and story teller.	2002-05-16

It is a page turner, and left me eager to see how the story line would all play out, though I felt it somewhat fizzled out in the end.<br />Grand Avenue is the setting for four women, the Grand Dames, each unique in personality and appearance. Meeting in the park near their home with their young daughters, the women become fast friends and confidents. The stage is set in the first chapter, as the reader is immediately warned that two of the friends will die, one a horrible death, and that one will turn out not to be a friend at all, a betrayor.<br />Grand Avenue was an entertaining, page-turner that left me anxious for the conclusion and kept me guessing with lots of twists and turns. Aside from the pure entertainment factor, the story also takes a look at the why's behind a person's personality, the insecurities, dreams and hopes. This novel would be a great read for a day at the beach, or to take along on a vacation.	2002-05-16

Chloe is a character who strives for independence. Raised in a multitude of foster homes, Chloe has built a wall of defense around herself and only allows room for love in her horse Absolom and her dog Hannah. Living in a small shack without running water or electricity, Chloe is a person of simplicity. When she meets Hank, the timing couldn't be better. As their relationship unfolds, Chloe endures a series of personal crisis that allow Hank to show her that the possibility of love is not something that we all only get one chance at. However, the question remains, will Chloe let herself believe this, or will she keep her barriers up?<br />Hank &amp; Chloe is a cute story of two people struggling to learn how to love one another, despite very different backgrounds and current lifestyles, but it teaches how love can overcome these things and a love for life can transcend surface differences.<BR>I only gave it 3 stars because at times I was somewhat bogged down by all of the horse references, as Chloe is a true horse lover and the story centers around this. Despite this, one can appreciate the obvious love that the author has for nature and all of it's beauty. Jo-Ann Mapson is an excellent writer. I favored Bad Girl Creek a bit more, but will still read Loving Chloe to see where she takes these two characters and look forward to more works by this very talented writer.<BR>Jo-Ann Mapson	2002-05-16

We get to know each friend, her strengths and weaknesses, her role in the dynamics of this circle of friends. The first chapter of the novel sets the reader up for suspense, not letting us know who the narrator is, and blantantly telling us, that amongst this close-knit group of women, 2 will die-one horribly, and one will betray, is not really a friend at all.<br />As the pages progress, Fielding takes the reader around many twists and turns, helping us to learn the characters even more and getting the mind reeling as to what will happen to fulfill the destiny we are told from the beginning. The character development is excellent, and the twists and turns highly entertaining, but I felt the ending was a let down and somewhat out of tune with most of the novel. The conclusions wrapped up a bit too quickly and were not quite convincing enough. It was a page turner, and a fun read-would make a great beach read.	2002-05-09

I had high hopes for the short novella that lay between the adorable cover of Off Keck Road, and the front flap describing the story as a coming of age story, of friends and the ups and downs of a small town life. Off Keck Road left me somewhat disappointed. <br />The story centered around Bea, a woman who grew up in Green Bay, left for a short time during college and briefly after, returns to her home town where she cares for her mother and develops a career and niche for herself. We also get a brief glimpse into the life of Shelley, a Keck Road resident who struggles with a sense of identity in her family and experiments a bit with love and physicality with men. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the story more if I could have gotten closer to the characters, if we were more clued in with feelings, dreams, disappointments. Simpson touched the surface at times, but I never quite got a connection with them. At times the writing was choppy and the characters hard to keep track of. I went back and read it a second time and enjoyed it a bit more, but overall it left me with a sense that the story was not fully developed. I will still read more by Simpson, but would recommend Anywhere but Here.	2002-05-09

The plot is full of surprising twists and turns in the dysfunctions of family &amp; small town community. When the main character Sissy LeBlanc finds herself face to face with her long lost highschool sweetheart, Parker, she has a lot of questions to ask herself and a lot of self-reflection to do. In an unhappy marriage to PeeWee Leblanc with three children, Sissy is put to the test. How far will she go to explore a lost love, how much does her marriage mean to her &amp; what about her children? It was difficult to rate this book because for writing it is a 5-once I started it I read straight through to see where the story was going and how it would all come together in the end. However, I had a hard time finding any sympathy for the main character, Sissy. Almost every character in the story was dysfuntional, but entertaining. I was hoping for a little more good substance in Sissy's character that I didn't find. This novel is an excellent beach read &amp; is entertaining. It does deliver what the title promises-scandal! Loraine Despres does have a gift for writing &amp; I would read more from this author.	2002-04-29

The story is more about the characters and their lessons. The descriptives at times can be gruesome, but are effective in painting the daunting image of Finch's life.  While I give the development of the story a 3, I would give the writing a 5. Reynolds has a true gift as a writer~	2002-04-19

Having read the book and adored it, I eagerly purchased the audio version so I could enjoy this story a second time. Jenna Lamia, the narrator, captures the essence and spirit of this beautiful tale of southern fiction splendidly. Her gentle voice and southern accent are adorable and fit perfectly the voice of the main character, little Lily Owens. On the flee from a daunting father, Lily escapes with her black caretaker, Rosaleen and finds herself a part of life with the three calendar sisters, August, May &amp; June. While serving as the apprentice beekeeper to August, Lily struggles to uncover secrets about her deceased mother, what lead her to this charming home of the calender sisters, and discovers some ugly truths about racial tensions in the south. Sue Monk Kidds first novel has earned a place as one of my favorite stories of all time. Jenna Lamia brings it to life as honey for the ears.	2002-04-19

This is one book that you can judge by it's cover. The story was just as cute &amp; cozy. Wynter is in the 7th year of her marriage to David when he springs the news on her that he &quot;needs a break.&quot; In shock and sorrow, Wynter retreats to Seattle where her friend C.M. suggests she come to get away for awhile. Wynter finds herself presented with an opportunity to bake bread in a quaint little bakery, The Queen Street Bakery.<br />Bread Alone explores the pain of getting over heartbreak, of what it's like to discover the person you thought you would wake up to for the rest of your life, no longer wants you. It takes us down the path of mother/daughter relationships and opens our eyes to the growing pains of discovering who we really are, and what makes us happy. It's also about frienships, both those with our most trusted and endearing girlfriends, as well as with the men who can prove that there are still some good ones out there. The recipe for this novel is complete as Judith Ryan Hendricks also gives us just that: recipes for bread, scones and the like woven into the heart of her story. Make sure you curl up with some piping hot, fresh bread and butter when you read this one, the cravings are endless, and the story a sastisfying and filling one.	2002-04-08

Within these pages we meet Annie and Carl, a young couple struggling against the tide, to make the first year of their marriage work.  Carl is a twenty year old law student, who gets cut-off financially from his family when they learn he has married Annie, an 18 year old girl from an uneducated, and poor family. The story chronologically walks us through the first year of marriage for Annie and Carl in an extremely simple, yet touching way. The writing style is simple, but effective.  Annie is an optimist and though she feels that she doesn't fit in amongst the college students and the scholarly life,  has an innocent zest to learn and adores books and writing. Carl, more of a realist, is a hard-working student who struggles to find time to be a good student and husband as well as provide financially. Blended in, are a rich cast of characters from the local grocer, Henry to the caring landlandy, Mrs. Hansmon, each adding a touch of humanity and warmth to the story.<br />This book should not be compared to A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, but based on its own merit. It is a feel good, comfort book, best described as wholesome, yet insightful. Yes it is simplistic at times, but it works. What the reader is left with is that love can endure, through sacrifice and trial. We can't do it all alone, it is only through the help of friends and community as well as faith. It reminds us, that if we are patient, we can all look toward tomorrow and find joy in the morning.	2002-04-02

Unfortunately, I did not find this to be a book that I enjoyed. The book was well written and full of a lot of lyrical/poetic prose. This is a book that requires much focus and concentration and despite my best efforts, I can't say that I enjoyed it. The novel, set in India does flashbacks from past to present around an Indian family. Rahel &amp; Estha are twins, born into a family that owns a pickling company. Most of the story is set during the 1960's and portrays a life of deep poverty and sadness. Through flashbacks from the past as well as current information, we learn the painful history of this family and the secrets that destroyed it. I had hoped to gain a better understanding of Indian culture, but personally felt the author only grazed the surface of this issue and never felt I got to really know or understand any of the characters. This is a book that I may have enjoyed more reading it in an English class to gain a full appreciation and understanding of the writing. While many may love this book, I don't think it's for everyone.	2002-04-01

You don't have to know the Bible inside and out, or really at all, to appreciate this novel. While the story is based on information from the Bible, the novel tells a bigger story about what it was like to live as a woman during this era. Like a balancing scale, the life of a woman seems to be a blend of subserviance as well as a celebration of one's gender. While women were responsible for catering to the men's needs, they also rejoiced in The Red Tent, a place they would go to during their monthly cycle, to bond and dote on one another.  <br />I was struck with how strong these women were and had an appreciation for how much easier it is to be a woman in today's world. The physical experience of childbirth during these times was so intense..without modern medicine death more prominent. The spirit that existed in this community of women was amazing in how they cared for and supported one another. <br />The novel was not action packed or fast moving, but what it does offer is a look at not only what it was like to live during this time and the obstacles that these women faced, but also explores the depths of mother/daughter relationships. It reminds us of the legacy that we can all leave behind and the mark we can leave here on earth long after we are gone.	2002-03-20

In both stories, a wife is living in a dark, unpleasant home environment. In A Recipe for Bees, Augusta, an older lady, approaching the end of her life, reflects back upon her childhood and her marriage. Her mother dies at a young age, leaving her alone with an unaffectionate father. When she meets Karl and they become married, Augusta moves from one unaffectionate household to another. Living at Karl's father's farm, Augusta is only subject to more withholding of affection and is living a dark and depressing life. The rest of the novel delves into Augusta's search for independence and what she chooses to make of her life. The story takes us down journeys of the ups and downs of marriage, being a misfit in the community, and mother/daughter relationships. The main problem reading it, is that I couldn't find it in me to like the main character, Augusta. I also felt that the story left the reader with a depressed feeling of what marriage is like.  The weaving of the &quot;bee&quot; theme added a nice touch to the story, but if you're looking for a great read with a &quot;bee&quot; them, try The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd. The writing in A Recipe for Bees was good, but I felt the story was lacking something~	2002-03-08

His wit and humor provide many laugh out loud moments. In this series of essays, we learn about some of the author's trials from childhood through adulthood. He handles some pretty deep issues with a sense of humor, keeping them light and entertaining. In the end I found I enjoyed the first half of the book much more than the latter half. His interaction with his mother and other members of the family, while somewhat dysfunctional, also manages to be touching and funny. As he moves into his teen years and becomes adventurous, we learn of his exploits in the art of hitchhiking and vacationing at a nudist colony.  This book does have a lot of &quot;bathroom&quot; humor, so I wouldn't reccommend it for the easily offended reader.  I have heard that Me Talk Pretty One Day is his finest yet, so will definitely read that one.	2002-03-02

You don't want to look, but you can't stop yourself. The story of the Piper family is one of sadness, perversion, and well kept secrets. The writing is excellent, though the reader may find themselves confused at times. Some things are written like riddles, that leave you wondering if what you read means what you think it means.  Keep reading..as the story unfolds, answers are revealed and things clarified.  This is definitely a dark book, so prepare yourself, but it also is a page turner. This book is hard to put down, because you will want to know where is it going, why? What does this all mean? After completing it, I'm still trying to figure out if I liked it? But there is no question, the writing is supreme and the characters are still with me. That's good writing.	2002-02-23

Who are these companions that only Eva can see and what is their purpose? I felt a slight disappointment with the story as I was waiting for some surprising twist that never happened. I also was never completely swept away by a mother/daughter bond theme. Despite this, the author's words are beautifully written, full of vivid imagery.

The writing in this novel is incredible. I think the reader should be prepared for the fact that this story is melancholy and can be depressing at times, but at the same time is brilliant in its character depth and social understanding. I wish I would have read this novel in highschool as there is clearly a lot of symbolism and statement that would lead to great discussions. The center of this novel is John Singer a deaf-mute who is feeling abandoned after his life-long friend Antonapoulos is sent away to a distant hospital. The novel introduces us to 4 lives: a young girl named Mick who grows up in poverty; Dr. Copeland, an African-American doctor; Jake Blount a wandering alcoholic and Biff Brannon a cafe owner. We learn the loneliness and pain of each of these characters and watch as each one is drawn to the mute, John Singer. McCullers details her novel with many truths about the human spirit, as well as some political and social statements of her own. It is said that much of the novel is autobiographical as McCullers was raised in a small southern town, primarily by her African-American maid. I would suggest that the reading of this novel is coupled with a little research about McCullers and some background info on the novel for full appreciation. Upon completion I am glad that I read this and can appreciate it for all that it offers and is trying to say.	2002-01-26

Their current project is to assemble Hy's grand-daughter, Finn's, marriage quilt. It is during this process that we get a glimpse into each of these women's love stories and learn what stitches &amp; fabrics their individual marriages are made up of.<br />I felt slightly disadvantaged reading this novel, after having seen and loved the movie dozens of times. When I realized the movie was based on a novel by Whitney Otto, I couldn't wait to delve into it.  Because I love the movie so much, I found it very hard to be objective while reading the book. To it's credit, the movie follows the book very closely.  The novel does provide some additional tidbits, but overall, I didn't feel that I learned a whole lot more from the book.<br />This book was well written and uniquely drawn, tying in the intricacies of quilt making with each woman. What we learn from the story is how different and complex marriages can be in various shapes and forms, but the common string that binds them all is one of love.	2002-01-18

I believe that what makes a novel a classic, is when it can be enjoyed and understood whether it is read one day after it is written or 50 years after it's release. Such is the case for Betty Smith's master piece. There isn't a lot of action and comotion in this novel, but there is a lot of life. It has it's moments of sadness, happiness and humor. There are issues that a young girl shouldn't have to deal with such as alcoholism, death...poverty but as in life the novel has it's ups and downs.

Beverly Cleary takes us back to her childhood and shares with us her memories of growing up in Oregon and what her family life was like. One can't help but notice, there are so many similarities between Ramona and a young Beverly Cleary!  As always, Cleary paints a perfect picture of life as a young girl and what it was like coming of age. Her words are full of honesty, insightfullness &amp; humor.  My only other recommendation is to make sure you buy On My Own Two Feet, which takes you through her adult years.  When A Girl from Yamhill is over, you will be hungry for more! Beverly Cleary is a timeless delight to read for all ages.	2001-12-04

Part of this novel reminds us of the dark past our nation has come from, times of slavery and the horrors of the civil war. The other piece to this novel reflects on how our childhoods shape who we become, both good and bad. The narrator, recalling her life as she approaches the end of it, recalls for us her terrible childhood, raised by an overbearing and horrendous father who left permanent scars on her psyche. My only complaint with the story is that it seems there is one devastating blow after another and yet for some unfortunate souls, this is life.  The lessons to take away from the novel make it worth the read.  When you're on your death bed and reflecting upon your life, will you be glad you drove the nicest car and had the finest of treasures? Or will your treasures be the upright and moral life you lived and the way you touched others?	2001-11-28

The writing is great, I would give Elinor Lipman 4 *'s for her writing talent, but this story just never took off for me.  Harriet Mahoney is a 40 something year old woman who finds herself alone after her live-in boyfriend of 12 years meets someone else. An aspiring writer, Harriet takes a job working for Isabel, living in her mansion &amp; helping her to ghostwrite a novel about Isabel's scandalous life.  Where this book fell short for me was in the character development-I never got to know or care too deeply about any of the characters.  I will still give Lipman's other novels a try as she is a talented writer.  This novel wasn't terrible, but I felt it was a little flat.	2001-11-14

But once I got into the book I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Bad Girl Creek is a story of friendship and love.  Phoebe, a thirty something year old woman who is confined to a wheel-chair, finds herself the inheritor of her deceased aunt's flower farm.  Still grieving from the loss of her aunt, Phoebe takes on 3 roommates.  The duration of Bad Girl Creek centers on how Phoebe comes to find these new roommates &amp; the friendships that form among them.  Each roommate brings to the novel her own set of baggage that she must work out.  This story is about friendship, of finding one's place in life, of learning to trust others &amp; of having faith.  Though the characters have problems, the writing is light and has just enough depth and comfort to make it a worthwhile read.	2001-11-12
US	51095446	RDWMFQHNKC2CY	0060188731	546555129	Bel Canto: A Novel	Books	3	33	39	N	N	Interesting Topic &amp; Good Writing	The first thing to note about Bel Canto is that you don't have to be a lover of Opera or be interested in a terrorist plot to take something away from this novel.  While neither opera nor terrorism are appealing reading topics for me, I am glad that I read this book.  The writing is excellent.  In summary, Mr. Hosokawa is given a birthday party by an unnamed South American Country.  His favorite opera singer Roxane Coss will perform. During the party, consisting of numerous international guests, terrorists take over and keep a group of 59 men &amp; one famous opera singer hostage for many months.  This novel explores how people, who can't speak the same language nor have much in common in the outside world, come to bond and care about one another.  You can't help but imagine how you might behave or feel if put in the same situation. The author also asks the question, is the life we live day to day, true of who we really are? Once the characters are put in a hostage situation, it seems that some traits they do not allow in the &quot;real world&quot; are allowed to come forward behind the walls in which they are being kept hostage.   Though many of the events that transpire seem unrealistic, Patchett's excellent writing makes most of it believable. The only disappointment was the ending, which still has me puzzled.	2001-11-01

One of the lines from the novel sums up my love &amp; appreciation for the writing:  &quot;..They wanted to create a place where people who are oppressed by the notion that there are too many books and too little time to read them might carve out a retreat;where gentle souls who carry the burden of knowing that the world is too much with them can set aside a week or ten days to whittle down their list of 'books to which I must one day get around'&quot;-As a lover of books, this idea sounds like the perfect escapism. That is what Bill Richardson accomplishes in his writing-escapism with the various characters we meet at the Bachelor Brothers Bed &amp; Breakfast, and another peek into the family unit of Hector &amp; Virgil. The book is speckaled with funny little anecdotes throughout.  While not quite as good as the first novel, it's still a charmer.	2001-10-19

What makes Nelson's book special  is that because it is supported by Grant's daughter Jennifer and wife Barbara, the reader can feel confident that the facts and descriptions reported are true to Cary Grant's character. The text is an enjoyable blend of Nancy Nelson's writing as well as Cary Grant's own words and the words of those who were his close friends.  I was in love with Cary Grant before reading this book, simply because I adore him in his movies.  After finishing it, I adored Cary Grant as not only an incredible actor, but as an endearing and generous friend, father &amp; husband. The mark that Cary Grant has left on us is priceless and his films continue to bring joy to so many generations after him.  His charm is timeless.  Nancy Nelson allows us to get as close to knowing Grant as we possibly can.  I highly recommend this book.	2001-10-12

As with several of Oprah's picks, this is not one I probably would have pulled off the shelf on my own, but I'm so glad that I read it. Part of what makes this novel so special is that Lalita Tademy, who was a successful career woman at Sun Microsystems, gave up her high paying salary to research her geneaology. After tracing her family's history, and gathering as many photos and facts as she could, she wove the pieces together into this historical work of fiction creating Cane River. Similar to so many previous stories of slavery, reading this will make you ashamed at the history of our country and saddened at how these lives were torn apart and abused through slave trading &amp; treatment.  But what is most powerful in the story is the strength of these three generations of women-Suzette, Philomene &amp; Emily; how they overcame adversity and pain and kept fighting for each new generation to live a better life, despite their own sadness. This novel explores each of these inspiring ladies lives, the men in their lives &amp; their families.  It explores issues such as racism, both white vs. black as well as racism within the black community (light coloring vs. dark coloring).  It examines the consequences of inter-racial relationship as well as how slaves were handled and treated. How can a person own a slave, but in some way feel the slave is part of the family?  One can't help but feel how simple our lives are today compared with all of the hardships these women faced.  The sacrifices that family will make for one another is truly remarkable.  Tademy did a fantastic job in recreating her family's history and sewing it into an incredible story.	2001-09-26

Simon will have you shaking in your boots-as he has the children. Convinced that Simon is out to kill them, Alice &amp; Simon live in fear of having their food poisoned or any other tactics Simon might use to get rid of them. This book has the reader in true suspense. Is Simon really trying to kill them, or are the children's imaginations running wild? Not only is Hepinstall's writing fantastic, she creates Alice &amp; Boone into two children who are not only smart and witty, but have incredible character depth. This novel has a chilling element of suspense but also a great demonstration on the bonds of sibling love and loyalty. There are also some laugh out loud moments as Alice and Boone have some witty wise-cracks and sarcasm that they play off of one another that provides a little comic relief throughout the novel. I couldn't put this book down!	2001-09-12

After losing their parents, the girls are raised by their grandmother, Minerva. The story begins when one of the sisters, Jo-Nell, is in an accident, and Freddie and Eleanor, come to her side to help her recover. The characters and their relationships with one another seemed a little under-developed. The novel takes an interesting look at how 3 individuals cope differently given many of the same obstacles to over come, and how they try to free themselves from their current obstacles. I think overall, this novel was just ok. For other great southern writing, try Big Stone Gap by Adrianna Trigiani or Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood by Rebecca Wells.	2001-09-12

In this novel, we meet Josie, who spends the summer living with her mom, and Josie's 3 year old boy Henry on the east coast. Peter, Josie's husband, is in California and Josie plans to join him in the fall. For the summer Josie has agreed to be a research assistant, helping Fiona Jones uncover anything she can get her hands on about Jackie Kennedy. This story explores the complexities of relationships-how do you know if you can trust your spouse, being happy with who you are, and accepting that famous or not, we all have our own obstacles and discoveries to make in life. Whether you are married to JFK or Peter, no marriage is perfect and you have to put in a lot of work and effort. Spend the summer with Josie-it's worth it!	2001-09-04

The novel details each of the lives of the various people who have owned the painting-either how they came to get the painting or pass it on and what importance the painting comes to play in their lives.  Each chapter is a short story of it's own, beginning in the present and working it's way back in time through the actual creation of the work of art.  I really enjoyed how Susan Vreeland took us back in time and the creative way in which she pieced each of the owners together. In the end I was left with a powerful feeling for many of the characters, both the artist, his subject and several of the owners. Not only was the story entertaining, but the themes that run through out the book are very thought provoking. The story touches on differences in perceptions of beauty, appreciation for the fun in life and the importance of love-how each of these play into giving one a sense of meaning and purpose. After finishing this book, it is still provoking much thought within me.	2001-08-31

Three women Ellie, Madison &amp; Leslie are, at age 40, pained and bitter about life. As they meet again for the first time since they were 21 they get a mystical chance to see what their life would have been like had they chosen different paths. This novel takes an interesting look at the &quot;what if's&quot; in life and how the choices we make in life so deeply affect us. It is not realistic, but I don't think it's supposed to be-but rather a creative way to explore the road not taken. The novel isn't too deep and the writing is light, but the subject is intriguing.	2001-08-26

Rebecca Ray seems to have talent as a writer-this was easy reading and I got good visuals of the characters, the setting and what was going on around them. However, the characters remain static throughout the entire book. Maybe that is why Rebecca Ray chose not to name the narrator/main character-we never really get to know her.  All we see is her quirks-her apologizing and men abusing her, but we never get to see why.  She cuts herself up, literally, but this is not explored any further.  The family is dysfunctional from beginning to end, but all we end up with is a 400 page snapshot of examples of the dysfunctionality without any insight or resolution. The ending is abrubt and without conclusion, resolution or insight.  I feel that Rebecca Ray is promising and capable of great things, but she needs a little development.	2001-08-14

Already stressed with normal teen angsts like fitting in and finding a boyfriend, Mia is horrified to learn that she is now the heir to the throne and has to be trained to be a &quot;fit&quot; Princess. With the help of her grandmother, Mia begrudgingly begins the training.  We meet a lot of characters at Mia's school, portrayed as the different personality types we all know or remember from our own school days.

The main character, Ian Bedloe, is a young boy who finds himself raising three children left behind by his deceased brother.

However, that is the only reason I can come up with to give this novel 2 stars. I'm all for a sweet romance, but this was too much. The writing was too syrupy and the &quot;pop culture&quot; references were corny. I found it tacky that he used JFK Jr &amp; Carolyn Bissette Kennedy as the means to which his main characters met one another. If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks writing, you may enjoy this one, but both are a little much for me. I really wanted to like this one, because the concept the novel was written in was clever (as a diary) and the story could have been a tear jerker, but I didn't get to feel for the characters.	2001-08-01

Trigiani is quite insightful in human traits and attitudes that can help us all get through life a little more easily. It was enjoyable to watch as Ave Maria learned so much about herself through the discoveries she made and how she learned to find herself and a place she was comfortable with in Big Stone Gap.

Patty Jane's House of Curl does have the same essence as Steel Magnolia's.  The characters are quirky and lovable.  If you've read Where the Heart Is, this novel is similar in that a lot of tragedy does occur.  Just when things start going well, you can be sure that something sad is lurking around the corner.

In an effort to cultivate their friendships one of the ladies decides the group should work on a church cookbook.  We get introduced to a little bit about each character's lives, but I felt that the author just scratched the surface and there wasn't a lot of substance.  It is an easy, light read and if you liked The Persian Pickle Club, you would probably like this novel as well.  I felt it had the right ingredients, but they just weren't stirred up enough to cook up any real emotion.	2001-07-06

What a delightful read!  The twins Hector &amp; Virgil alternate chapters telling tidbits of information and charming stories about their lives, their b&amp;b  and people they have met along the way.  Thrown in are entries from guests of the B&amp;B. There are many laugh out loud moments. The pictures painted are cozy, light hearted and humorous.  Reading it is like curling up into a warm quilt and spoiling yourself with a mug of hot cocoa. I can't wait to read more from this author.	2001-07-04

The story is told in alternating chapters from Jimmy's view and then Emily's view so the reader can see the differences in man vs. woman perspective.  I like the concept, but felt the effect fell short in that the  differences weren't written strongly enough to capture any real significance. The shortcoming leaves the reader feeling like they are reading a recap of what they just read in the previous chapter.  It also seems that the book is weighed just as heavily on what the experience of war is like for a soldier as much as it is on trying to dig up a lost romance and the romance is definitely the more intriguing part of the story.  I was also somewhat disappointed with the choices that the characters made, but in honesty they are probably realistic choices.  The premise of this novel was excellent, but I felt that there was too much missing to make it as good as it could have been.	2001-06-30

Forced to read it as it was a selection chosen for a book club, I ended up liking it.  It is the retelling of the classic Cinderella, but told from a different vantage point-one of the Ugly Stepsisters. In a clever twist on there being two sides to every story, the concept of this novel gives the reader a whole new perception of what the Cinderella story could have been about.  Although not the magical fairy tale of Disney's Cinderella, the author was able to keep the fairy tale essence in his writing style.  This book was unique and thoughtful.	2001-06-28

The rest of the novel is about her conquests and experiences in her journey to create the new Jemima and try to get her man. The writing style is very elementary and there isn't a lot of substance here, but it is a perfect beach read-and has it's entertaining moments.	2001-06-28

However, upon finishing it, I was glad that I took the time to read it. The story is of the Oufkir family and how they were held prisoner by the Morrocan government after their father attempted to assinate King Hassan II.  The conditions they endured for the twenty years they were held captive were horrendous.  Yes, the story is a depressing one, but you can't help appreciate in the end,what this family endured and how the bonds of love can get people through the most trying of times.  I found the novel was hard to get into initially, but give it a chance.  It picks up toward the middle and becomes very engaging for the remainder. It will leave you feeling a little richer and a little more appreciative of your own life.	2001-06-28

Isabelle is devastated when she learns a secret that her daughter Amy has kept from her.  As a single mother, who can often come across as rigid and controlling, Isabelle tries to raise her daughter with dignity and prevent her child from making the same painful mistakes that are a part of her past.  The author does a phenominal job in helping the reader really know the characters and feel their anguish.	2001-06-28

Myra is in her 50's and has always been on the &quot;outside&quot; with feelings of insecurity and not being a part of the &quot;popular&quot; crowd.  As an adult she is a traveling nurse who has an excellent repoir with her patients and has made a comfortable life for herself-but she is alone. She suddenly finds Chip Reardon as one of her new patients.  Chip is the token popular guy from highschool who Myra always had a crush on.  Chip has come home to die and Myra is now to be his nurse.  Through the novel Myra learns that she has a lot to offer and that she is worthy-something she's never felt before.  Yes, it's a tearjerker and one may be turned off when they find it to be another cancer story.  However, Berg creates characters that are so likable and flawed, you can't help but be pulled in.  Her talents are proven again.	2001-06-28

Although a work of fiction, there is so much real detail on the inside world of a geisha and the culture.  The story is very engaging and stays with you long after the novel has ended.	2001-06-28

From other reviews most people LOVED it, giving it 5 stars or a few rated it very POOR.  Neither rating captured my sentiments.  Two other reviews did capture it's essense-NO FRIED GREEN TOMATOES and another that explained-it's not a bad novel and if you're looking for a quick, light, southern cozy/light mystery read this is for you.  I don't believe it's an &quot;If you loved Divine Secrets, you'll love this.&quot; I don't think it's as good as the Ya-Ya's. And it did cross my mind that the story is very similar to Fried Green Tomatoes.  If you take it for what it is-a quick, light read, you won't be disappointed.	2001-06-25
US	51095446	R2MI9Q4YL3UA4	0786867655	704251230	Cranberry Queen	Books	2	7	10	N	N	Somewhat Disappointing	I was very excited to read this book.  I really liked the title and the cover and the sleeve made the novel look very interesting.  The story is about Diana, a young thirty-something whose life is suddenly turned upside down.  The bulk of the novel is about Diana trying to cope with the tragedy in her life and how she moves on.  I think this novel had a lot of potential but it didn't seem to go as deep as I hoped it would.  I also thought the ending was unsatisfying for the reader.  There is a lot of good information about cranberry bogs and in reading the acknowldgements at the end of the book, one can appreciate the story a bit more after learning some of the author's background.  I think it was a good first novel but would have liked a bit more depth.	2001-05-30

Becky Bloomwood is an energetic, creative &amp; crazy single girl who loves to shop.  This book highlights one silly antic after another and even though Becky can sometimes be ridiculous, you can't help but love her.  This is a very light-hearted, easy read.  If you're looking for a fun easy read and you like &quot;girl&quot; stuff, this book is for you.  I read it within 2 days and was sad when it was over.	2001-02-12
