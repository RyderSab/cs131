Tempest Down was a disappointment.  This book, Rogue Angel, was worse.<br /><br />Mr. Rovin has, once again, seen fit to dispense with actual research and veracity, substituting lame plot points and actual idiocy for a story.<br /><br />The forms of address are once again incorrect.  Rear Admirals are not called \\"Rear Admiral\\" by anyone unless they are in deep trouble and getting reamed out.  Likewise Lieutenant Commander.  Just a jarring bit that made the story grind to a halt.<br /><br />As far as the LASER team, let's leave aside the fact that there are already teams formed for rescues under adverse conditions.  The LASER team seems to delight in doing training that will likely kill its members.  No one trains for missions by parachuting into a live volcano.  What utter nonsense.  If they wanted to practice extracting people from fires, they could do what every fire department does, and simulate the fire.  But that would not give us an opportunity to see just how inept the LASER team is at executing what is supposed to be their main job.  Poor writing.<br /><br />The aircraft are complete nonsense.  Aside from using non-military aircraft for military missions, and having subsonic aircraft being considered for sustained supersonic flight, the flight sequences are poorly done at best.  Radar is a super detection device, able to see from Sakhalin Island by Japan all the way to California, or it can't see another aircraft a short distance away.  Even backscatter over the horizon radar can't do what is in this story.<br /><br />The Angel itself is tested off an aircraft carrier, the USS Hidalgo.  USS Hidalgo?  When did we have a president or military hero named Hidalgo?  Must have missed that class.  The Angel itself is described as being the size of a Boeing 737.  Flying off a Nimitz class carrier?  And then being able to land back on the same carrier?  No wonder Rovin had to decide to make the Angel be able to flap its wings to hover.  Ridiculous as that sounds, it is no more ridiculous than landing a 737 sized aircraft on a carrier.<br /><br />Let's look at the Chinese.  At first I thought Rovin was writing about Taiwan.  Why?  Because the two main Chinese characters have first names of Bruce and Christine.  Last name of Chan.  Born in mainland China.  Bruce and Christine?  Well, at least the book had a laugh in it.<br /><br />Then we have Chinese fighter aircraft flying across the Pacific ocean, refueling from a tanker, making an incursion into American airspace, with the end intention of landing on the Brazilian aircraft carrier Sao Palo.  A simple look at Jane's All the World's Navies would have told Mr. Rovin how idiotic that idea is.<br /><br />Lastly, Mr. Rovin seems to think that if he needs an acronym, why just make one up.  After all, SOP might mean Standard Operating Procedure in the real world, and in every other military techno-thriller in the world, but Rovin just tosses out ridiculous phrases and keeps going, much like an 8 year old making up military sounding words while playing soldier.<br /><br />Please don't waste your hard-earned money on this.  If you want it that bad, e-mail me your address, I'll send you my copy.  Normally I'd give the used book to the Veteran's Hospital nearby, but I figure the Vets have suffered enough.<br /><br />Definite don't buy/don't bother reading.decide to make the Angel be able to flap its wings to hover.

In fact, all I will note is that I spent four and one half years in the air force, and yet I seem to know more about naval operations than Mr. Rovin.<br /><br />One jarring thing that kept leaping out is Rovin's insistence on using full rank titles, all the time.  This is done only when the person being addressed is in deep trouble for something.  Constantly calling someone \\"rear admiral\\" is a sure way to get a stern talking to.<br /><br />This had all the makings of a good, maybe even a great story.  Unfortunately, those makings were left to rot.<br /><br />Tom Clancy should sue just for having his name on the same book cover as Rovin's.<br /><br />I feel like I was robbed.	2005-10-07

I fear that, judging from this book, the wish will not be granted.<br /><br />While Mr. Cussler has not been one of my favorite authors of late, too much nonsense and self-promotion, one thing that I will always say for Clive Cussler, his research for his books was always excellent.<br /><br />Ted Bell on the other hand, seems to feel that he can toss out any old piece of writing and expect people to accept it as accurate.  The mistakes are many, and they so detract from what is supposed to be a techno-thriller as to make it laughable at best.<br /><br />Alexander Hawke, the protagonist, is supposed to be an ex-Royal Navy pilot.  Who flew ROYAL (read that British) Navy F-14 Tomcats in the Persian Gulf war.  Not as an exchange pilot, as a British pilot off of British aircraft carriers.  Really?  Must have been one of those secret arms deals.<br /><br />We have another character playing with the safety on a Glock semi-auto pistol.  Another example of someone (Mr. Bell) who probably saw a Glock once and made erroneous assumptions.  There is no safety on a Glock, the small lever is the take-down lever used to disassemble the pistol for cleaning.<br /><br />Another scene has Hawke deciding to land his home built seaplane on a US aircraft carrier.  Using the arresting cables.  No tailhook on his seaplane, no problem.  His mechanics will install one overnight, never mind that using something like that on an aircraft not designed for it would simply tear the aircraft apart on landing.<br /><br />We have a Russian super submarine that fires Russian \\"Type III\\" torpedoes.  Never heard of those, and neither has Jane's All the worlds weapons systems.  Ah well, just some inconvienent facts to discard.<br /><br />We have an ensign in the US Navy serving as a steward in a wardroom on a US Aircraft carrier.  Maybe in charge of the stewards, but a commissioned officer as a steward?  Nope.  More poor research.<br /><br />Characters are presented as being cardboard cutouts of action figures.  Alexander Hawke is either a dithering buffoon unable to make a decision, or a hard charging, go into battle without any solid plan superduper hero type.  Both are idiotic at best.<br /><br />It appears as if Mr. Bell simply counted pages, and when a certain amount went by, had something explode for no real reason or had somebody get beat up just to prove the machismo of Hawke or the evil intentions of the extremely one-dimensional villians.<br /><br />This book reads like a creative writing assignment done by a hormonally enraged teenage boy out to prove how tough he thinks he is.<br /><br />Please don't waste your money.haracters are presented as being cardboard cutouts of action figures.

Unfortunately that is lost in the first few pages.  Many different attacks are planned, and every time one is ready to occur, the US military is there to thwart it.  But of course, that would be boring, so like on the old \\"Star Trek\\" TV series, whenever the transporter would get the boys out of a jam, it malfunctioned.  Likewise the US military.  In this book the military is at best a bunch of imbeciles who can't seem to do the simplest task without destroying their own equipment.  It got boring after a while.<br /><br />The various attacks are serious, but there is no follow-up.  Some of the attacks are enough to bring the country to its knees, but the results are glossed over, or just not mentioned at all.<br /><br />Sorry Mr. Weber, but a techno-thriller writer has a responsibility to stick to what could happen, and then to wrap up what did happen.<br /><br />As a side note, the whole book is a set-up for a sequel.  This is another problem I have with this.  I am sick and tired of bad guys making miraculous escapes and then coming back to haunt us in other books.<br /><br />Maybe Mr. Weber should look up the term \\"deus ex machina\\" before he writes his next book.	2005-06-14

A character who seems to be the personification of evil, and a dark plan hinted at.<br /><br />Unfortunately the book quickly goes off track after that.  We are treated to a polemic against the death penalty, seemingly regardless of the crime.  There are pages and pages of description of newspaper antics which have absolutely nothing to do with the story, and sub plots and sidelines that are never adequately fleshed out or resolved.<br /><br />Mr. McCoy uses the plot device of jumping back and forth in time so we can have some idea about why the main character acts as he does.  Unfortunately there is no indication to this, so I found myself stopping and wondering just what was going on.<br /><br />Mr. McCoy also took quite a bit of the book to scold the United States over the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  He went into pages of detail of how horrible this was, and the effects on the poplulation of those two cities, making it seem as if some poor innocent country was attacked with nuclear weapons for no reason other than existing.  Oh, to be sure he puts in one (ONE) short paragraph admitting that Japan started WW2, and quickly mentions and then glosses over the rapes of China, Korea and the rest of the Asian theatre.  I suppose this is going to set us up for what comes later in the book, but it never does.  All it does is give Mr. McCoy an excuse to slip his views into a novel without any reason for them to be there.  He excuses all of this to explain why his main character doesn't wear ties!  A bit of a stretch to say the least.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are sexual adventurers who seem ready to jump into bed with Andy (the \\"hero\\") at the jump of a mattress, but all of whom are then conflicted about how horrible it is.  A subplot, which was very difficult to weed out of the story line involved a divorce and the main character's mother, none of which had any bearing whatsoever on the story.<br /><br />I feel as if I read a short story that was filled with garbage in order to make it novel length.<br /><br />As to the action sequences, while they were interesting they seemed to be placed as an afterthought.  And, as one of my personal pet peeves, the research was half-hearted.  At one point we have a UH-60A Blackhawk helicopter crewman telling us that they were fully armed, with 7.62MM machine guns and a fully loaded 105MM howitzer ready to go.  While UH-60 can lift a 105 howitzer to transport it, firing it would be impossible.  Just poor research.<br /><br />Don't bother, unless you want to waste your hard earned money for what is essentially an apologist's view of domestic terrorism.earing whatsoever on the story. <br /> <br />I feel as if I read a short story that was filled with garbage in order to make it novel length. <br /> <br />As to the action sequences, while they were interesting they seemed to be placed as an afterthought.

Paramount is accuracy.  While the first book, The Last Jihad, seemed to have very little in the way of technical errors, The Last Days just abound with them, and they detract from the story, such as it is.<br /><br />There are plot gimmicks that are cheats.  In one instance the author gets his hero into a life or death situation with no way out.  Then, shades of \\"Dallas\\", Bennet, the hero wakens to find it was all a dream.  Later in the book when Mr. Rosenberg had evidently figured out how to extricate everybody, the same sequence is used, but with a happier ending.<br /><br />Technical errors are glaring.  In what is a favorite of writers who don't do their research, Mr. Rosenberg has his hero taking off the safety on a .357 magnum pistol.  A revolver?  With a safety!  As a side note, that little push lever is what you use to swing out the cylinder on a revolver in order to reload it.  Later we have \\"clips\\" being used to reload this same revolver.  For the record, even with a semi-automatic pistol, the item that holds the ammunition is called a magazine.  A clip is used for rifles, and not pistols.  This shows poor research.<br /><br />In another scene we have one of the characters taking the \\"safety\\" off of a Glock semi-auto pistol.  The Glock pistol, in all of its iterations, does not have a safety.  That little lever is what is used to take apart the pistol for cleaning.  The only Glock that uses anything else has a lever that switches it from semi-auto to full automatic fire, but no safety.  Again poor research.<br /><br />One scene has the main characters being rescued by Seahawk helicopters from the Gaza Strip area and taken to the USS Reagan off the coast of Israel.  Bennet, the main character, hopes they won't fall into the Atlantic Ocean when they land on the carrier.  The ATLANTIC ocean???  That must be some Seahawk to make it from Israel to the Atlantic.  Just poor research.<br /><br />There is an ongoing plot device that uses continuous rainstorms blanketing the entire area from the Straits of Gibraltar to Israel.  These storms of course interfere with rescue attempts and flight operations, but only for the good guys.  Evidently the bad guys can launch aircraft in any weather and simply fly around it.  This is reminiscent of the old Star Trek episodes when Scotty couldn't beam them up due to \\"ion\\" storms or somesuch.<br /><br />The entire operation, and I won't give it away in case you decide to punish yourself and actually buy this trash, is run by the president of the US.  From Washington D.C.  We have FBI agents calling the president to get approval on basic tasks.  While micro-management does happen, this book thrives on it.  No one, from the FBI director to any military leaders to anyone else can make any decision, no matter how trivial, without the direct intervention of the president.  I suppose this was supposed to make the McPherson presidential character appear to be in charge, but what happens is it makes everyone else appear to be incompetent, and the president doubly so since he appointed the leader.<br /><br />Unless you're a glutton for poorly researched novels, don't bother with this one.  Don't waste your money.n ongoing plot device that uses continuous rainstorms blanketing the entire area from the Straits of Gibraltar to Israel.

We see Vornado and Dillinger as midshipmen and what they have to deal with.  Unfortunately this is where the character development starts to break down.  We never really find out why a first class midshipman has it out for the two of them, just some half developed stuff about not trading on daddy.  A missed opportunity for character development there.<br /><br />I won't go into a spoiler, as the other reviewers did, about the taking of a nuke submarine, I'll just say that it seemed less than plausible.  However another opportunity was missed here too.  A chance to show why terrorists were going to do what they planned to do later in the book was missed.<br /><br />The Arab terrorists were generic to say the least, and there was no background to what they were trying to do.  Without giving away too much of the plot, the plan to launch nuclear cruise missiles at Israel, while a nice twist, left me wondering about several things.  The USA knows about the plot, but yet they wait until the terrorists have the means, and are underway before attempting to stop them???<br /><br />Some mention was made about this being post 9/11.  That being said, it absolutely blows credibility out of the water to think that extraordinary measures were not taken to find and stop the terrorists before they had the submarine that is central to the story.  We are to believe that the Russian Federation would sit idly by while a submarine is being assembled under their noses.  No protests, no attempts to destroy the sub, whose location is well known.  Nothing but sitting by and waiting for the thing to put to sea and then hope to stop it there.  Hard to believe, and harder to read.<br /><br />As far as the female/male character interaction aboard the various submarines involved, sophmoric is the word that came to mind to describe the actions of the characters.  We are supposed to believe that in a submarine looking for a rogue nuke sub the captain would take time to engage in a dalliance with another crew member.  If Clancy had written this, it would've been laughed out of the book stores.<br /><br />I'm sure someone will note that people on warships have feelings too.  And to them I say, of course they do, but during a search for a submarine that they know is going to launch missiles is hardly the time to play Untersee Love Boat.<br /><br />There was plenty of action, unfortunately it all adds up to a sum that is much less than the whole of its parts.  If this is the start of a new series, then I expect disappointment if it continues in this vein.<br /><br />As far as technical research, there may be much that is accurate in the book.  However there is one point where a fire is being fought.  Halon is used, so as to make it possible to continue to breathe.  I have dealt with Halon, it displaces the oxygen in an atmosphere, thereby removing a requirement for combustion.  It does NOT, regardless of what the author states, damage electronic equipment.  In point of fact, it was specifically designed so that it would not harm electronic equipment.  But it does make it impossible to breathe, contrary to what the author says.  This makes me wonder what other technical aspects were fudged or just plain wrong.  Plausibility was a big casaulty here.<br /><br />Cartoon cardboard characters, a plot that is ridiculous, and poor technical research.  A waste.  Don't bother.

The plot moves along quite nicely, with just the right amount of \\"drag\\" on the good guys.<br /><br />By drag I mean this, it is possible for the US to send its high-tech war machines against virtually any country and come out on top.  This is due to the large amounts of money spent on the quality as opposed to quantity of weapons systems.  Smart bombs, eyes in the sky, that sort of thing.  This would make for a very dull book.  So there is a spy, who we never get a good \\"read\\" on, who makes it his/her job to report on every move that is being made against Pakistan.  The motives of this spy are not explored, but the spy does provide a nice counterpoint to the seeming invincibility of American firepower.<br /><br />I will not go into whether or not Pakistani or Korean names are correct, as I do not know the facts of the discussion.  However the idea that the gloves are off in the worldwide fight against all forms of terrorism is a good one.  Fighting by Marquis of Queensbury rules while the other guy is beating you with a 2X4 is a great way to get dead in a hurry.  This book shows that shooting first and not asking questions may be one way to go.<br /><br />As far as not giving a full 5 stars, there was one technical detail that leapt out at me and ruined the perfect score.  At one point Mr. Hagberg has a special ops team getting into AH-1W Super Cobras for a mission, 8 troops to a helicopter.  A TWO SEAT helicopter.  I had a mental image of troops hooked to hard points on the stubby wings for a bit.  But that is my only complaint.<br /><br />Go ahead and buy the book, its a good one.	2004-11-22

I was ready in all respects.<br /><br />I will state that the story is truly frightening.  The idea that there could be what the author postulates is a scary one.  The execution of the main line of the plot goes along fairly well.<br /><br />However...  (you knew there was a \\"however\\")<br /><br />The devil is in the details.  The cover of this book makes it look like a techno-thriller.  That allows the reader to assume certain things.  The first assumption is that while there might be one or two less than believable main plot points to get the book started, the details in the book will be accurate.<br /><br />Its the details that fail.  There is one scene where a helicopter uses \\"burners\\" to exit an area.  On a helicopter?  Afterburners?  Really now.  Anyone who has read anything past the most basic of flight knows this is absurd.  And as long as I'm complaining about helicopters, this book is supposed to take place several years in the future.  Why then is the US military using Huey helicopters, a design that is currently in its 50th year for critical missions?  Were all the Blackhawks grounded?  In addition, it would seem that the Iraqi military has somehow gotten ahold of some of these overage Hueys for their own use.  Somewhat unbelievable.<br /><br />The narrative itself seems to jump around a bit, requiring the reader to backtrack to figure out what happened.<br /><br />In addition, there are some plot points that go unresolved.  Without giving away too much, at one point an alternate target is mentioned after a major primary target is hit.  Then nothing.  We never find out what happens to the alternate.  Was it hit also?  It seemed important enough for the bad guys to mention it, so what happened to it?  In addition, after the main target is hit, there is almost no mention of the after effects of the strike.  This is surprising since it is the after effects that were the main reason for the strike in the first place.  No mention of the results.<br /><br />As far as the romance end of things, while I am in favor of the hero getting the girl, having this discussion in the middle of a firefight is extremely unrealistic to say the least.<br /><br />It seems as if Mr. Buchannan wanted to get a message across about red mercury (not giving anything away here), and just tossd in a generic mix of action, characters and some details to do it.<br /><br />Not a bad story idea, but not 5 stars.in the first place.

There is plenty of metal flying around, the other services are included in the total warfare concept (something sorely missing in other books.  You know, the Navy, Air Force, whatever wins the war alone type of thing.)  In short, a very good read.<br /><br />I note that homage is paid to Tom Clancy and Red Storm Rising.  One of the finest novels ever written about modern war as far as I'm concerned.  Although Mr. Farmer doesn't spend a Clancyesque 200 pages setting up the battle, the same authenticity is there.  You just know that he's \\"been there and done that\\" when it comes to armor.<br /><br />Buy the book, you will not regret it.	2004-09-29

In fact, looking at recent events, maybe not so far off the track at all.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I believe the characters were well thought out, not one dimensional as is the case in some books where action takes precedence over character development.  Not perfect, but very well done.<br /><br />The technical aspects seem to be right on the money, at least as far as I can tell from additional research on various military websites.  My only complaint is that no author seems to feel the need to explain just what a specific unit designation means, ie:  Battilion 2/64 etc.  I have never been able to figure this out, but I am sure that to an Army trained person it is obvious.  That is my only complaint.<br /><br />To put it simply, go out and buy this book.  Steal it if you must, but it is a terrific read.  Well worth the money.	2004-09-25

Only the Republicans can do anything, the Democrats are totally inept.  This is the main premise of the presidential \\"crisis\\" that is pivotal to the book.  Where was the Secret Service while this was happening?  The idea is idiotic to say the least.<br /><br />The story itself is an interesting idea, which is unfortunately so poorly executed as to be almost unreadable.  The main idea is that a volcano in the Canary Islands will erupt and cause a \\"mega-tsunami\\" which will effectively destroy the east coast of the USA and the coast of Europe.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Mr. Robinson can't even keep his technical details straight even when he is making them up himself.  At one point, describing how the tsunami will form, he says it will start at 1 kilometer in height and then increase to 150 feet when it hits the east coast.  Sounds like a decrease to me, but I never was good at math.  In addition, what a tsunami is was explained at least three times in the book, to people allegedly intelligent, who you would think had heard of the concept.<br /><br />Poor editing there.<br /><br />As to the other technical details, they don't border on the ridiculous, they leap-frog right past it.  F-15s being flown by the Navy,  US Air Force squadrons embarked on a carrier, a Harpoon missile being used as an anti-air weapon!  Did Robinson simply pick the names and nomenclatures of weapons out of a copy of Jane's All the World's Weapons Systems at random?<br /><br />His cruise missiles use \\"sonar\\" altimeters to keep their altitude.  The Patriots are either flying at \\"near the speed of light\\" or else possibly not capable of doing the intercept job.  Which is it?  The list goes on.<br /><br />A pivotal plot point involves bringing an aircraft carrier out to search for the rogue submarine, the carrier being loaded with Seahawk sub-hunter helicopters.  Pages are devoted to the transfer of these helicopters from this carrier, to another carrier already in the area.  The danger and complexity involved in transferring the fixed wing aircraft from the already resident carrier to the helicopter carrier (also a Nuke class CVN) and the helicopters to the first had me wondering, why not just fly off the carrier that brought them?  Needless nonsense that makes no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />As to the sub hunt itself, it was idiotic from the start.  We have the US Navy command searching for a submarine that they know they can't hear with passive sonar, and just using radar in the hope they will run across a periscope above water.  Well, if you're searching for a sub you know is going to launch nuclear missiles, just use active sonar, right?  Maybe not the same range, but effective nonetheless.<br /><br />I could go on, but I'll leave it with this thought.  Techno-thrillers, unless they are science fiction, must, and I repeat must, be plausible.  They have to \\"follow the rules\\" as it were.  Otherwise it's just bad, and I mean very bad fiction.<br /><br />Love or hate Tom Clancy, but he always has his facts straight.  In fact, if he read this book, he's probably laughing himself to sleep at night secure in the knowledge that Robinson poses no threat to Clancy in the techno-thriller genre.<br /><br />Don't buy it, don't even borrow a copy.

However, put them together and it seems like they just tossed some nonsense together and called it a book.<br />They fall for the trite &quot;deus ex machina&quot; ploy when their main characters are in trouble.  The &quot;art room&quot; will be able to see all and fix all.  Of course this wears thin after a very short while, so the authors have to have the super techno stuff fail at the worst possible moments.  (Think first Star Trek series when the transporter would fail just when it is needed to beam up the crew and you get the picture.)<br />The main characters are literally all over the map, with almost no explanation as to what they are doing wherever they happen to be.  Poor plotting, extremely poor character development, and virtually no attempts at bringing all the disparite plot lines together leaves the reader with the feeling that they just wasted their money.<br />The only upside is the teaser in the back of the book for the upcoming &quot;Liars and Thieves&quot; looks like a good read.  However it also seems to be a Coonts novel.  Maybe he should stick to solo writing.<br />Don't bother.  Don't waste your money.  I wish I didn't.	2004-06-01

I can even get past the whole &quot;Tailhook&quot; thing, but I have a major problem with the ending.<br />As some of the other reviewers have stated, the book just sort of peters out.  There is a great build-up, likeable if slightly unbelieveable characters, and some terrific action.  Then it all sort of fizzles out.<br />I won't give away the plot of the book (others have already done that), but it almost seems like the ending was either re-written for whatever reason, or rushed to print.  It just does not satisfy the reader.  Too much is left dangling, too much left unfinished.<br />I don't know, maybe this is just a lead-in to a sequel???	2004-04-20

Add a star if you like your horror plausible.<br />As far as the negative reviews, maybe they should go back and re-read the book.  The main character is indeed a programmer who is now too old to write code.  That doesn't mean he isn't a programmer any more.  As far as the rabit scene, which seems to be a major stumbling block, well rabbits are small creatures, humans are larger.  Get over it.<br />As far as the explanations, all I can say is, if you read any Tom Clancy you are used to long explanations.  If you read the explanations you understand why, maybe not immediately, but further on in the book.  This is called setting up a plot device.  Those people who didn't understand why the main character was called out to the site didn't read the explanations, they only skimmed them.<br />If you want to have a no-brainer read, go elsewhere.<br />If you want to wonder about what is being cooked up in labs behind closed doors, and how it can affect the human race, this is the book for you.<br />Go ahead, skip the latte at the coffee shop and spend the cash on this book instead, you won't be sorry.	2003-11-23

The best thing I can say for this book is that it was loaned to me.  I didn't spend any money on it.  That's the best I can say.<br />Scot Harvath is an uber-agent.  Only he knows how to do anything in the world of counter-terrorism.  Once you get past this, you must accept that he can also do anything, at any time.  About the only bright spot was during the section on the training at a CIA facility.  The pranks were the only smile I got out of the entire book.<br />To be honest, after the cliched skyjacking, the cliched Arab terrorists and the cliched acts of terror that were supposed to target Israel as the bad guys, I was cliched out.<br />Garbage.<br />On the cover of the paperback it says something about Clancy fans not being disappointed.  This was obviously written by a family member of the author.  Buy this book and disappointment will be the least you will feel.<br />Take a pass on this.  Save your money.	2003-10-14

Our trusty hero runs around spouting silly things like &quot;sweep and creep&quot; and the like and we are expected to believe this is how the US Secret Service personnel truly talk.  I speak from experience when I say, a load of rubbish.<br />The plot was predictable at best, but to be honest, drawn out would be a better description.<br />There was plenty of action, unfortunately none of it made sense.  The entire Secret Service is made to look like a bunch of idiots, except of course for our hero.  (And no, I'm not a secret service agent)<br />The whole thing is just not believable.  From Swiss super mercenaries that no one seems to know about, to the tired plot device of a big government conspiracy, the whole thing just sort of sits there like a bad exercise in cliches.<br />Don't bother.

Okay, so I'm not the only reader who picked up on the Heinlein references in the book.  There are probably even more than I noticed.  The book is not derivative, it's just a fun read.<br />If you're looking for some kind of deep thought piece, this won't do it.  If you want a book that you will think, geez this could maybe happen in a few years, this is it.<br />The characters are well drawn, you get a feel for why they do what they do, the science is plausible within the framework of the book, and the plot moves along.<br />I would have been happier if the book had been longer, I get the feeling that some things were edited out to make the book more commercial, that's why the four and one half stars.<br />However I'd reccommend the book.

The blurb on the back tells you that cloning of Jesus Christ is part of the book.  But is it?  We are never fully allowed to know.  As far as the cloning itself, too unreal, too contrived to establish a plot point.<br />The main character in the book seems to be on a quest, I won't say what for in case you actually decide to buy this nonsense.  But by the end of the quest I found that I was just relieved it was over.<br />As far as the plague, all I can say is Stephen King did it better in the book \\"The Stand\\", and it was more believable.  The book builds and builds and then just dissappoints at the end.  A total waste of time.<br />Characters are one-dimensional at best, and when the author tries to flesh them out, I found myself hoping they would get killed off since they were so boring to read about.<br />This book could've been one of the great ones, instead Mr. Long opted for the easy way out of any plot points, and the entire book just comes across as dismal.  Even Stephen King, who couldn't write a happy ending if his life depended on it, managed a more upbeat ending in \\"The Stand\\" than Mr. Long even attempted in this book.<br />Blather, and not well done blather at that.

That book had so many plot twists and improbabilities that it just galled me to read it.  Picked this one up by mistake.<br />Reilly still is fond of the deus ex machina plot device.  Things just seem to pop up just when the characters neeed them most.  Same goes for the story line, as such.  Need some weapons?  No problem, let's put a bunch on Marine 1 (although I note in Mr. Reilly's defense, he does state in the forward that he took many liberties with the facts) and let the characters find them when they need them.  Let's put some Komodo dragons into the mix so we have some excitement there.  Add stuff as it's needed and justify it as you go along.<br />While the book seems to have been written by a teenager who is making things up without regard to accuracy, it is a fast read.<br />Don't expect to find any great American novel here.  Just mindless action with no regard for facts.  Not much character developement either, as another reviewer has noted.  Just understand this, the book reads like a James Bond movie watches.  If you've seen a Bond movie, you know what I'm talking about.  No &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; there, but fun and mindless.<br />Ditto for this book.  Fun and mindless.

Mr. Hubbell does neither.  He gets into a little (very little) about paradoxes and also about how the time machine works, but just enough to set the stage.<br />I must say that all the way through the book I thought I had the ending pegged.  I didn't mind, as this is one of those books you keep reading even though you know the ending.  Good characters, good plot settings and fine action.<br />Then you get to the end.  All I will say is, you're not going to believe it.  Either that or you are more cognizant of what was going on.  Regardless, it took me by surprise, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.<br />Go ahead, spend your money on this one, you won't be sorry.	2002-12-16

The plot is a direct imitation of Independence Day, War of the Worlds, and any number of other SF titles that were MUCH better done. The book itself is the first in a series.  It is not a \\"stand-alone\\" read.  If you care to find out what happens, you won't, but if, you must buy at least the next book in the series.<br />We are asked to believe that the Sauron race descends upon Earth, laying waste to everything they see.  They conquer all, with no reply from an emasculated military.  But wait, while the military can't seem to make the weapons be effective, by God, some good old boys from the back country can get those aliens.  But not enough to matter.  By the end of the book I was hoping for some kind of finale.  It wasn't there.  In fact, the book endpapers tell you to look for the next book in the series, \\"Earthrise\\".<br />I'm here to tell you, don't bother.  I don't mind series books, in fact Harry Turtledove has turned them into a cottage industry.  But Mr. Turtledove's books can be read as a series or individually.  You will pick up immediately what is happening.  Mr. Dietz however seems to think that he can put some garbage together, publish the book and we will \\"need\\" to see how it comes out.<br />Again, don't bother.  I won't go into what is supposed to be a morality tale about race relations, because to be honest, Mr. Dietz doesn't do it very well.<br />It could've been worse.

Yes, there is a lot of action.  Yes, there is a lot of time spent on (in?) submarines.  But no, the believability factor is missing.<br />Mr. Dimercurio seems to want to use a jackhammer when a small tap with a ballpeen will do.  We have mysterious state troopers pulling people over to get them to meetings.  Doesn't anyone own a pager 20 years from now?  Why is everything so contrived?  Why is the US getting involved in a war that seems to affect absolutely no one on this continent?  For that matter, why are the British involved?  And the coup de grace for the believable factor comes with a missle attack in the Suez Canal that should leave the American Admiral in chains as a war criminal.  Where is the public outcry, the press wanting to know just what the hell is going on?<br />I don't mind suspending belief to read a good story.  I just expect that story to have some sort of basis in plausibility.<br />As far as the characters go, all I will say is, no one who is a main character in these books seems to be able to die.  Good guys, bad guys, it's all the same.  They can survive darn near anything, and we are expected to accept that.<br />Mr. Dimercurio, I have wasted  my last dollar on you.	2002-12-01

By the same token, I do expect a book with over 860 pages to be very &quot;meaty&quot;.  I was NOT dissappointed in this regard.  The stage is set for further Harrington novels, loose ends are gathered up (notice that I didn't say snipped), and we even get some combat.<br />It is that lack of more combat which took that half star away from the book.  I admit it, I'm a dyed in the wool military SF fan, and while this book has some very satisfying combat scenes in it, there could be more.<br />The only comparison I can think of is a Tom Clancy novel.  You can wait for five or six hundred pages for something to happen, but when it does, it's worth the wait.  The same holds true here for me.  I felt that this was worth the read, and I reccomend it without reservation.<br />And get ready for the follow-on books...	2002-11-18

In other words, with just a little background in the book, you can read it without reading anything else in the series.

The story itself is a good one, sort of an &quot;Urban Legend&quot; meets Steven King thing.<br />I won't go into specifics.  I will say that if you're looking for a &quot;keep me up with the door locked&quot; book, this probably isn't it.  It's no 'Salem's Lot, but then, few things are.  What it is, it's a story about how ordinary people are presented with extraordinary occurances and how they deal with them, along with the rest of what is happening in their lives.<br />I reccomend this book without reservation.

I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who has even the slightest interest in the US Navy.  Aside from providing what seems to be an accurate account of the fire and the events that led up to it, and followed it, this book also provides an insight into how the ordinary seaman lived and worked.<br />The descriptions of how jobs were done, and how the sailors coped with their surroundings are almost worth a book by themselves.  This seems to be an accurate accounting of the way things were, and probably still are, aboard an aircraft carrier.<br />There is of course one small quibble.  At one point in the book, Mr. Freeman refers to Commander Rowland as the highest ranking enlisted man on the ship.  He goes on to say how this is accomplished.  As most know, commander is a &quot;commissioned&quot; rank, and not enlisted.  As far as the differing routes that some reviewers caught, to be honest I missed it, being caught up in the whole story of what was coming.<br />I recommend this book without reservation.

I can get past the typographical errors, as that is a publishing problem.  I just can't get past the poor writing.<br />The characters are ridiculous in the extreme.  And the situations they get into are absurd.  In one instance, we are expected to believe that one character can allow a car to flatten a police motorcycle, with the cop standing there, and just receive a summons and drive away.  In what universe?  The aerospace company is named Sparo.  The aircraft involved is a cartoon of what a real aircraft should be.  In fact, any 8 year old could describe a plane better than the author.<br />All in all a dissappointment from start to finish.  I was at the point of wishing bad things happen to the characters, just to liven things up.  The author makes an attempt at a sub-plot, with an art history professor possibly spotting that Leonardo da Vinci is in modern times, but this goes nowhere.  It's as if the author started the chapter one day, came back a few days later and finished it without bothering to read what he had written.<br />The &quot;action&quot; more or less takes place in a thinly disguised Canada, with some action occuring in Florence, Italy about 500 years in the past.  The only reason I can think of for the author not to come right out and say the college town is in Canada is he is afraid of being sued by Canada for defamation of national character.<br />The only saving grace to this whole debacle is I purchased the book from the bargain rack, and that solely because the cover looked interesting and the price was well below ten dollars.

It reads like a very bad &quot;B&quot; movie out of Hollywood, but without the production values.<br />The characters are wooden at best, the plot is so transparent as to be figured out in the first few pages, and the so called &quot;insider writing&quot; that the author seems to claim with his alleged experience on the USS Enterprise is the biggest laugh of all.<br />Most novels expect you to suspend belief in order to read them.  This novel expects you to suspend your intelligence too.  We are expected to believe that National Security Council agents (???) are stupid enough to rent an apartment and not sweep it for eavesdropping equipment.  We are expected to believe that the Navy would allow one of its nuclear carriers to blithely sail into known danger without stopping it.  In short, we are expected to become imbeciles.<br />This book reads like some kind of locker-room sea story that gets told to ones friends, the more outrageous, the more ridiculous, the better.<br />Don't bother, unless as I said, you need a laugh.	2002-07-19

While I'm sure that the technical merits of the hardware involved in this book are accurate, the merits of the characters are not.<br />I must say that I have enjoyed the other Amanda Garret books immensely.  Which is why this was such a huge dissappointment.  Amanda Garret was/is tough but fair, easy to be commanded by but the sort of demanding boss that gets her troops to work well for her.  Until this book that is.  Now Ms. Garret is reduced to a simpering puppy-love struck school girl who just can't help but fall into bed with her adversary.  The sexual scenes involving Garret, and her pal Christine Rendino, do not add to the book.  In fact they read almost as if some editor looked at the manuscript and said, \\"hey, we need some sex in this thing\\".<br />And that is just the way it reads.  The sex is an add-on which contributes nothing, the characters were doing so well up til this point.  Some of the characters we'd like to know more about, but don't get the chance.  These include the admiral in charge and the helicopter pilot who seems to be quite a character in his own right.<br />The plot contrivances are stretched so thin you can see right through them.  Need a secret base?  Poof, one appears as if by magic.  Need to track the heroine?  Poof, suddenly the National Reconnasence Office can task a satellite right where it needs to be.  Need a new country to act as villian?  Hey, Indonesia looks promising.  And so on.<br />The only feeling I got from this book was that I was making a mortgage payment for the author.  His heart seemed to be elsewhere, this being written only to fullfil some type of contractual agreement.  There was no zest in this book.  Nothing like the first in the series.<br />My reccommendation:  Don't buy it.  Save your money.	2002-07-08

The book actually reads like a novel, with many characters contributing to the outcome of the book, with the difference being that this story is ongoing.<br />The points made in the book for the continuance of these deterrent patrols is a strong one.  I am sure there are people who actually believe that the world is a great big happy place now and these submarines are an anachronism at best.  And to those people I would say, read this book, see what is going on and sleep well.<br />However, and you knew there just had to be a &quot;however&quot;, I have just one criticism of the book.  Or to be precise, the way some of the crew members are described.  It is almost a reverse prejudice, a sort of &quot;look how much we entrust to these people&quot; kind of thing.  What I mean by this is that when Mr. Waller is describing crew members, he invariably tells of them being tall, dark haired, whatever.  But when a Black crewmember is described, Mr. Waller goes out of his way to point out that this is a Black person he is talking about.  Almost as if to say, &quot;see, they are here and we do give them important jobs.&quot;  I have actually noticed this sort of thing in other books, and it just seems to leap off the page at me when I see it.<br />Aside from this, the book is excellent and I would rate it a &quot;go out and buy&quot; type of book.  You will not be dissappointed.	2002-06-13
US	49684118	R148VWTMVQGFEH	0743435257	901207868	Gust Front	Books	4	6	7	N	N	John Ringo has arrived...	I will start this review by saying this, if you want brand new, cutting edge, never been seen science fiction, look elsewhere.<br />However, if you want sit down and read good book, this is for you.  Mr. Ringo brings forward the characters from \\"A Hymn Before Battle\\" quite nicely, and fleshes out most of them.  Some new characters are introduced, and a welcome addition they are to the series.  My only quibble would be the lack of terror that should be felt by the refugees from the fighting.  It is touched on in a tangental manner, but we really don't feel it.  But that is minor, and possibly these days best left to the reader's imagination anyway.<br />There was some quibbling about this being some kind of Clancy rip-off.  I disagree.  The book is long, 700+ pages.  But well worth the space.  The descriptions of the weapons are needed to show why the soldiers stand and fight the way they do. (Murphy's Law #7 of Combat:  If the enemy is in range of you, you are in range of him.)  This is important to why the story is done the way it is.  As far as a complaint about why the American soldiers don't pick up the weapons of the Posleen and use them, how would they?  Remember, the Armored suit troopers (not giving anything away here) are already better armed.  The Posleen are ten times as strong as a human.  How would a human pick up and use a weapon that is too heavy to field?  First maxim of combat:  It doesn't matter how good your weapon is if you can't bring it to bear on the enemy. (probably not #1, but it should be)<br />My final thought on this book is...Go and buy it.  You will NOT be sorry.	2002-05-13

After reading further reviews I purchased the book, and I must say I'm not dissappointed in any way.<br />While there are elements here from other SF writers, I viewed them as more of an &quot;homage&quot; to these other writers rather than derivation.  In fact it was fun to pick out some of them.  (Readers of Starship Troopers will definately know what I'm talking about)<br />The reason for the four star rating is that this is a first solo attempt, although I do seem to see some input from Mr. Weber here and there.  But it does stand fine.<br />Do note that it is the first in a series, and from the looks of it, it will be a fine series.<br />I rate this book a definate buy.  It's worth the money.	2002-05-13

The glossary in the back (why do they always put it in the back of the book when I start at the front?) was helpful.  The characters were well drawn out as far as the crew of the USS Tulsa, and the other characters, including the female characters (disregard the editorial reviews) were well done.<br />The action moves along very well.  In fact, I found myself tempted to glance ahead a couple of dozen times to see how the characters would get out of certain situations.<br />There is no &quot;formulaic&quot; plot to this book.  You don't get it telegraphed pages ahead what is going to happen.  And with the recent sinking of the RFS Kursk, the book is even more timely.<br />Now, as to why only 4 stars:  I felt that the end was a tad abrupt.  Not to say that it doesn't finish the story as it is laid out, but there are some issues that could have been dealt with, but weren't.  This may be a bid for a sequel, but I somehow doubt it.  I would have liked to know, for example, the outcome of the several boards of inquiry that were talked about throughout the book.<br />But on the whole, I can reccommend this without reservation.  It is a definate go out and buy it book.	2002-04-10

But there is a little bit that most of the other reviewers seemed to have missed.  We may not have seen the last of the bugs.  Not giving anything away, but stay tuned for more.<br />As far as the action, it is top-notch.  If you liked In Death Ground, you're gonna love this.  While some of the book is repetitive, it doesn't detract from the book.  There is the usual Weber touch, making us feel something for the characters, sort of like the Harrington series.  And Mr. White can write like nobodies business.  I can't wait to see what comes next.<br />Go out and buy this book, with the caveat that you should read the first book, \\"In Death Ground\\".  But you will not be dissappointed.	2002-02-28

Ms. Ramthun makes a common error in describing Air Force enlisted personnel as &quot;soldiers&quot; and &quot;privates&quot;.  As an Air Force veteran this is glaringly incorrect, airman or senior airman would be approriate.  Also there is mention of Eileen Reed as an Air Force pilot, but this is not gone into.<br />There is another passage in the book where Eileen's partner is described as &quot;transferring from the East&quot;.  I suppose this is a common mistake, but there is no nationwide ability for police officers to transfer from one state to another.  If there was, there'd be no cops left in the Snow Belt.<br />The characters however are right there, and even the prior shooting that Eileen Reed describes and the aftermath is accurate.  The reader will NOT believe what the character does with a victim after the first described shooting (you have to wait til the end of the book to get to this), but it is accurate, and as a police officer, I can say that this sort of thing happens, and it is turned a blind eye to.<br />Go and buy this one.  The small errors are just that, small.  The book is a good read.	2002-01-14

Character development is nil, and what attempts are made are cliches.  Whenever a character is about to do something, a sense of deja vu takes over.  And well it should, you've read this stuff before, and the realism of the hardware and locales notwithstanding, the people in the book a less than zero.<br />As far as plot development, forget it.  There is a passing reference somewhere about a Seawolf submarine, so I guess that justifies the title.  As far as problems to be solved, the author resorts to the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; method.  You need some help, hey let's have one of the good guys be a sleeper agent for an allied power, who just &quot;happens&quot; to have a submarine off the coast (this was hinted at, but poorly done).<br />I hate to say it, but this series seems like it was rushed to print to take advantage over the current military situation in the world.  If this is the case, then shame on the publisher, and if this is just the author's best, maybe he should consider some serious rewriting.<br />Don't bother with this book, you'll only be let down by your expectations.  I know I was.  Although on the plus side, now when I see the author's name on a book, I'll know to save my money.	2001-12-27

If you want a space opera that keeps going, this is the place.  The prince is shown to be a royal pain in the butt, but then, that's what royalty tends towards, until someone takes a shot at them.  The Marines are shown as true to life.  Someone made a comment about the constant swearing by the Marines.  Well I'm here to tell you, in a combat situation, proper language and etiquette are the first things out the window.  And these Marines seem real to me.<br />The problems shown with procurement of weapons is realistic.  One only has to look back at the problems of the M-16 rifles during the Viet Nam war to see that every problem is not ironed out before a weapon system goes to the troops.<br />As far as the romance, or lack thereof, hey, it's a combat novel.  If you want romance, go to the bodice ripper aisle.<br />I like the characters.  I am starting to like Prince Roger more and more, as I suspect the authors planned.  The rest of the cast is shown to be human, even the aliens.  They are us, and we are all in the fight.<br />Buy this one, I don't think you'll regret it.	2001-12-27
US	49684118	R3C8PZ30B0P1TM	0425180093	72854739	The Sixth Fleet	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Sequelmania	While this book may be accurate in its technical details of Navy operations, there are other facets which are disturbing.  Foremost is the obvious lead in to a sequel.  While I have nothing against a &quot;series&quot; type of book, each book in the series should be a stand alone novel.  This book ends with no obvious solutions to the situations generated, and with no real idea whether there is any reason to continue.  There is no give and take.  The US Navy is pictured as constantly taking hits with no way to respond.  There is an obvious attempt to show the US Navy against impossible odds, but the reader figures that the USA will prevail in the future.  It seems as if the author has written himself into a corner and will have to resort to gimmicks to extricate himself.<br />Since I have the second book in the series also, I should be able to comment on that book soon.<br />And a minor(or not, it is after all a 'technical' matter) with the terminolgy.  It is an M-60 machine gun, not an MG-60 as is repeated in the book.<br />I hope this series improves.  I give it one or two more tries then I'm outta here.	2001-12-13

It also gives us some insight into what Dragons and their riders will be doing.  I was very satisfied with the plot, the development of the newer characters and even the romantic interest held my attention.  I especially liked seeing K'van and Heth again, as their story, &quot;The Littlest Dragon Rider&quot; (at least that's what I remember the title to be) is what started me on my journey to Pern.<br />The book also shows a developing society.  While some may nitpick with how dragons are referred to (calling Golanth Golly), I see this as an indication of an evolving people who are exploring their new found societal mores.  I find nothing wrong with having seperate classes, ie; Holders, Weyrfolk, Craftspeople, as this is the society that was put in place by the original settlers of the planet.  Instead of trying to put some type of modern PC spin on the series, readers should remember that it is a work of fiction, not a thesis on how to live.<br />If I had to complain about any one thing, it would be the way the Abominators are dealt with.  It seemed a bit deus ex machina for my taste, but one quibble in an otherwise terrific book doesn't stop me from wholeheartedly reccomending this book.<br />Go out and order this one, it is the prelude of great things to come on Pern.	2001-07-03

He has an accurate read on Rudy Giuliani (thinly disguised here) and his group of sychophants.  The Rudy &quot;bunker&quot; mentality is well portrayed here, as is the &quot;New York City vs. Everyone Else school of thought.  Even the Rudy Bunker, perversely built in the World Trade Center, is accurately shown for the folly that it is.  The police department is realistically shown, except for one small dig at Long Islanders who are city cops, but one can't have everything.  The action, once you get past the stretch of imagination required for the 100 Chinese submarines, is non-stop.  The New York character is well written here, these are the people of NYC, average, above average, and some decidedly below average.  But they're all here, and they all play a part.<br />If you're looking for deep socio-political thought, go elsewhere.  If you want an enjoyable read, something to sit around the pool with, this is the book for you.<br />I recommend this as a good buy.  It's worth the read, just don't go looking for deep thought here.	2001-04-26

The continual lack of quotation marks (maybe that key was broken on the keyboard?) is annoying to say the least.  To try and figure out who is talking, and about what detracts from the pace of the story.<br />The characters were one dimensional at best.  There is nothing to bring us into the character's mindset.  These are not sympathetic people we can care about.<br />As far as the gunfights themselves, they are the product of someone who's total association with gun wounds is from the movies, television, and the ramblings of those that are credited in the acknowledgement section.  These things do not happen the way they are described here.  As a Police Officer in New York City I can say with some authority and experience that the author's idea of what would happen during an assination and it's aftermath is obviously grounded in some kind of Francis Ford Coppolla vision of idiocy.<br />The research, apart from the weapons themselves, with which the author seems to have devoted more time to than the story, is sadly lacking.  A glaring example,  in one description of action the author talks about NYPD and NYC fire department helicopters on the scene of some action.  What a surprise to the Fire Department in New York City that does not, and never has had, any helicopters at all.  A simple phone call would have told the author that.  The scenes where the cops are all either bumblers or criminals is the view of a lawyer who has been trained to see all cops as either criminals or idiots.  In other words a stereotype.  And speaking of stereotypes, it would seem that the author went to great lengths to be able to include the &quot;N&quot; word at every possible juncture, called for or not.<br />Another complaint is the large type in the paperback version.  This would seem to be an attempt to pad out the size of the book so that it appears that you are getting more than you really are.<br />This book reads like an exercise in a creative writing class that just about deserved a C for the attempt.

What I got was better.  While Mr. Clancy has admittedly never been in the navy, and seems to get around that by sometimes excessive technical discussions, Capt Harlow needs no such artifice.  We are introduced to the technology only on the level to which we require for the story.  The characters, while they may seem outlandish, are very true to life.  In fact, as a police officer in NYC, and having helped many sailors out of scrapes during Fleet Week, I can say that the liberty sequences, even though they seem outlandish, are dead on.<br />As far as the story, all I can say is, could be, very well could be.  The premise is not out of the realm of possibilities, and Capt Harlow does NOT resort to &quot;deus ex machina&quot; solutions to plot problems.  What happens could happen, and when it does you look at the book and think, &quot;well, sure I can see that happening.&quot;<br />As far as the rest of the cast of characters, and the way that the Secret Service acts and would act in the face of a threat to the president, he hit that one on the head, dead on.<br />I recommend this book as a definate go out and buy.<br />Keep up the good work Captain, I await whatever you write next.	2001-03-11

To say I was pleased with this novel would be an understatement.  While I do draw certain paralells to the first Die Hard movie, this book does diverge on many points.  We are treated to yet another look into the minds of politicians who once again are rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, a recurring theme with Mr. Flynn.  Unfortunately this seems to be an altogether realistic view of certain politicians.  We also see the inner workings and motivations of the special units that go a long way towards protecting the citizens of this country.<br />There are numerous technical items that are very believeable.  The use of remoted cameras, scrambled radios, and others are but to name a few.  The weapons are realistic, the tactics and their inherent risks and advantages are likewise on the mark.  There are even areas where our heroes make mistakes, and they rise above it, showing that they are human, and not some kind of James Bond superspy.<br />This is another keeper, and I have already ordered the next novel that Mr. Flynn has written.  If he keeps this up, certain well known authors of technothrillers will have to move over and make room for the new big dog on the block.<br />Go out, buy this book and enjoy.

He does not waste the readers time with endless motivations by the characters in the book.  While the characters do seem a bit one-dimensional, they are easy to keep track of.  While several stereotypes are played out here, they all have a ring of truth to them.  Yes, there are people in the world who see everything in black and white, and there are certainly politicians that strive to make political gains out of any situation.<br />The picture painted of &quot;senior White House Officials&quot; basically rearranging the deck chairs on a sinking Titanic rings true.  There is very little doubt as to who is doing what to whom.  Mr. Flynn does not try to make this a mystery novel, rather a procedural on assination and it's aftermath.  We are introduced to some characters who have deep motivations for what they do, and we can sympathize with them.<br />Mr. Flynn does not resort to &quot;deus ex machina&quot; by having magical weapons or characters appear when the situation becomes dire.  What transpires in the novel appears to have a genuine flow to it.<br />As a first novel, I reccommend it with few reservations.  As I have started his second novel, I now look forward to finishing &quot;Transfer of Power&quot; and going on to the third novel.  I will note that while some characters do make appearances in both of the novels, each book is certainly a stand alone read.<br />Mr. Flynn looks to be quite the writer and if he keeps this up, I will definately keep buying his books.	2000-11-17
US	49684118	R2EHVX2BS4CX23	038080316X	645272947	Colony Fleet	Books	2	9	13	N	N	Average Science Fiction, Nothing New	Generation ships to the stars, rigid caste system that isn't so rigid, a main character who isn't compelling, and an adversary (can't call him villian) who we just don't care about.  This stuff has been done to death, and in this case there is nothing new.  I thought there would be some interesting plot turns when the opportunity arose, but alas, no.<br />Ms. Matthews seemed content to write an average book with no real &quot;bite&quot; to it.  There is simply nothing here to hold a readers attention.  The science is straightforward, and the people seem to be wooden.  The characters are in an essentially life or death situation, and yet they are reduced to rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.  Average or slightly below.  A true ho-hum of a book.<br />Sorry, not worth any real effort.	2000-11-13

The plot is predictable right down to the obligatory hospital scenes and male/female buddy bonding scenes that are so fashionable right now.  What I find most disturbing isn't the lack of credibility in the story line or the weapons or the characters.  What is most disturbing is this book is an obvious set-up for follow on novels.<br />Mr. Hemry seems to have taken one large novel and broken it down into seperate books.  One wonders if this is for the monetary or artistic ways this can play out.  If you write a book about the Moon and war thereon, don't stop half way and tease.  Write the whole thing and publish it.  If Robert Heinlein had tried to publish &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; in this manner he would have been laughed out of his publishers office.<br />The authors of today should stop trying to milk the endless sequel cash cow and just get back to the business of writing enjoyable self contained novels.	2000-11-10
US	49684118	R2JF47AURKH3XV	0399145931	699086817	Sea Fighter	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Way to go Mr. Cobb.	This book takes Amanda Garret in a new direction, and it is a fine way to go.  The book is believable, the plot works, the characters are human and we can sympathize with them.  As far as one reviewer's complaint about the dialoge reference demolitions, that's the way those guys talk.  Their commanders do put up with it since they are a small and highly skilled group.  Go out and spend the money on this book, you won't be dissapointed.<br />And for an extra treat, e-mail Mr. Cobb at the address he puts in the book.  Unlike Mr. Clancy, Cobb still answers his e-mails and evidently personally (one teeny little misspelling, ah well).<br />I highly recommend this book.  It is an excellent read and hits all the right buttons.	2000-11-06
US	49684118	RJZECFZPIAM1M	006103004X	893798538	Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Topical and Downright Interesting Read	This book reads like a Clancy novel, except it really happened.  And with the recent Kursk disaster in the Russian Navy the book becomes all the more topical.  It takes us into a world that has been covered by &quot;national security&quot; for so long that the government has forgotten that there is a human side to the whole submarine espionage equation.  This book takes us into the subs, and into their crews like nothing before.  There have been novels hinting at some of this, and news stories about some of this, but this book is the total look at the whole thing.<br />A reader can not help but be enthralled by what happens under the ice, or in the Western Pacific during some of the operations described here.  The fact that this is still going on, and with good reason I might add, only adds to the value of the book.  This book is worth the price, and worth the time to read.  Go out and order it, you won't be sorry.  But be forewarned, set aside enough time to read it in large doses, because you will NOT want to put it down.	2000-10-30
US	49684118	R1E34WPLFAGY1U	0312971230	724985102	Ice Station (Scarecrow Series)	Books	1	5	7	N	N	Absolutely Ridiculous	I won't spoil the story for any readers who feel bound and determined to waste their money on this collection of idiocy, but you'd be better off watching an old James Bond movie than reading this &quot;book&quot;.  We have NATO partners committing acts of war against each other, both in the Antarctic and in their home countries.  We have miraculous weapons which appear and dissappear as needed regardless of the story line.  The phrase &quot;deux ex machina&quot; (God in the machine) comes to mind with the nonsense that we see.  The hero needs some esoteric piece of equipment, no problem, he will swim unaided in Antarctic waters and find an ice station that suddenly appears out of the ages with just what he needs.  Chased by killer whales?  No sweat, just press a magic button on a magic crossbow (which we are to believe is what the US Marine Corps chooses to arm their Recon Forces with) and be whisked out of danger.  Expect more silliness like this, including things that even Albert Broccoli would never have had the nerve to put into a Bond movie.<br />This book should be kept as a text in Creative Writing courses under the heading, &quot;What Not To Do When Writing an Alleged Techno-Thriller).<br />The author would have done well to remember that the phrase techno-thriller implies technology that works, and some honesty in the story lines and plot twists.<br />Ridiculous, absurd and a waste of good paper.	2000-10-17
US	49684118	R3LFOAZVTAISQF	0805055789	684938954	NYPD: A City and Its Police	Books	1	22	28	N	N	Axe to Grind?  Ommisionist History?  You decide.	It would appear that the two authors have some kind of axe to grind against the NYPD.  If one is to believe this book, all New York City cops are corrupt, or inept, or just lucky bumblers who when they do solve a crime, do so by sheer luck.  This is omissionist history at its worst.  As an insider in the NYPD I feel I know what I am speaking about.  These two authors seem to be the type of person who, once having been denied entrance to the police department, set about tearing it down.  It is a one-sided look at the police department, with absolutely no in-depth look at how the &quot;job&quot; actually works.  Don't waste your money on this tripe.	2000-10-14
US	49684118	R3SX1JH483DEXU	0843947071	432526743	The Pegasus Project	Books	1	2	2	N	N	Less than one star for this one.	After reading this book, all I can say is, awful, awful, awful.  The author seems to have found a thesaurus and was bound to use it.  The flight sequences are horrible, the characters are impossible to like, and the plot  lines are idiotic.  We have a C-141 as an AWACS plane (not done, basic  research would have shown this), and this plane, after being shot down, has  the crew picked up by unknown helicopters that somehow manage to beat out  F-16s to the scene of the shootdown.  There are implausabilities in the  actions of carrier groups (one that will take two weeks to transit a couple  thousand miles), and it is just an exercise in what the author could throw  onto paper.  Do NOT buy this book.  If you want good military fiction,  look for Proud Legions, an excellent book, with realistic details and very  readable.  Pass on Pegasus Project.	2000-06-14

My only complaint is that there was no way to make it longer.  The characters were real, I felt as if I could see their motivations for their actions.  I could visualize what  was happening by using the multiple maps that were in the book, and the  description of the M1A2 Tank and glossary were topnotch.  A definate  keeper.  More, more, more!	2000-06-14
US	49684118	R3EBSW8PUN7013	0380808927	358617375	For Duty and Honor	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Huge dissapointment	After reading this book, I tried to sort through all of the loose threads and realized I could weave a rug with what wasn't cleared up.  While the descriptions of life on a carrier may have been accurate, the story-telling  just isn't there.  We are asked to suspend belief, and to believe that 8000  naval personnel would blindly follow orders without checking.  As just one  example, we have the carrier supposedly at EMCON (emissions control-nothing  radiated), and yet crewmembers are recieving and sending e-mails.  And this  is just one of the minor inconsistancies.  All in all a very dissapointing  book.  I'd reccomend reading an old Tom Clancy before you spend your cash  on this one.	2000-04-29

After reading the author's reviews of various telescopes I was able to make an informed decision.  The sections on what to buy, and more importantly, what not to buy were invaluble.  If  you are considering astronomy as a hobby, or just want to find out if it is  for you, invest in this book FIRST!	2000-04-27
