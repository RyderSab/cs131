If you are interested in the world when a voyage could take years and many men never came back, a world where the broadside and the sword were master, this book is for you.  It's entertaining, educational, inspirational, and has a sweep seldom found. I wish I could rate the book higher than 5 stars. Dampier I would rate ten.	2004-05-05

For a generation of americans, viet nam was part of our minds, our bodies, and our lives, present and forever. Laurence brings that place, and time,back. I am not entirely sure I wanted to revisit.

I think it helps to have  a nautical backround.It also helps to be the kind of person the author writes about, since he portrays people in shadows and shades, and events move slowly most of the time. He has the sea right, he has these players right. I wish the end had been either slightly different, or slightly longer to taste it more, but you cannot have it all. This book is really about the process, not the ending anyway.	2002-04-07

Great recipes, great cooking, great presentation. Not practical. Yes, I can cook this way, but not in real life.  If I want a book for only 6 times a year when I want to spend excessive amounts of time on, I can do it.  I can do Charlie Trotter. I just don't want to.

As good as it is, and it is good, and well written, it is not a book for the casual, or even interested, reader. The book is filled with graphs, charts, and technical evaluations.  if you know your captain, this is the place to find out why and when, and where he served. The book does not give enough detail to feel the spirit of most of these men. For that, look to the books titled &quot;Broadside&quot;, or &quot;The Sea Warriors&quot;.	2002-01-06

It is a very good book, but it has a couple of things that could have improved it beyound measure. 1.  There are so many remarkable men in all navies  and battles that the reader needs something to distinquish them after the years of war.  2. I wanted more details on the battles, perhaps some diagrams. 3. I would have liked to have known more about what happened to these men after the wars. Cochrane, as an example, died the year the american civil war started.  But not to quibble, this is a good book that puts it all together. You just stay hungry.	2001-08-20

This is an interesting book, more from what it does not say as does.  Smith was not a great man, not a nice man, not a particularly likable man. But he had luck, and time, and place on his side. He made do in the only war he had, and he had the brains to take avantage, the luck to survive, and the good fortune to put the two together.

When I read this book, I was struck by the difference in histories of the German death camps and the Japanese.<br />What is striking is the apathy toward the Japanese biological and chemical warfare testing by the allies. Is it because the victims were Chinese?  Or was it related to an occidental acceptance or oriental suffering? Or was it just money, exhaustion, and the interest by the allies in the field?<br />In any event, the very dryness of this book makes it more compelling. And the cooperation after the war between the US government and the Japanese authorities is shattering.<br />What is even more depressing is the see no evil attitude after the war by the Japanese. Almost no information made it to the Japanese people, and they appear to care less.    <br />At least they moved on to making transistors.	2001-05-03

Read through the night and finish the book, or savor the writing and take longer to read it. In the end, I read until i fell asleep at three in the morning.

One of the problems in modern American society is the feeling that history started in 1940, and for some even later. This book shows that heroes were born and made and lived even as early as 200 years ago. The Horatio Hornblower books, the Patrick O'brien books, the Alexander Kent books. they are all based on this man. Now we can meet the real man, warts and all. And he fits into the world of America's beginnings, the Napoleonic wars, Revolutionary France, freedom in south america. Nearly up to the civil war. From round shot to rifled rounds.

I have read this book two times. So obviously, I find it compelling. The first time I read it as straight military history, the second more critically.  There is no doubt about the bravery on both sides. My  questions are these:  Without the huge American fire power, air, and  resources, this battle would have been an unmitigated disaster. How could  this have been avoided ? And the other question is, General Moore left  Vietnam after only 6 months.  What had the military learned, and why was he  pulled. This truly was a formative battle and a precursor of the future.  And a disasterous tribute to the futility on both sides. What a waste.	2000-03-13

I believe almost everything in this book is true. I think the assumptions are correct, the assessments realistic and true. But, its impossible to accept at face value, because 100 pages of footnotes marked confidential do not a  proof make. By the very nature of the subject, there is subterfuge  and deception, secrecy and deceit. In the end, you have to believe a good  part of this book without seeing all the footprints.

In a time where Viet Nam is ancient history, World War  two is pre history. Somewhere in line with the dinosaurs. Despite Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line.  So this is a good book, one to make us remember and think.   What surprised me, but should not have, was the quality of Pyle's writing.  It is beautiful, simple, haunting, clear and evocative. You have to wonder  what would have happened if he had lived and how he would have gone into  the time after the darkness. I think Hemingway said something to the effect  that each man has a right time to die. If so, Pyle's timing was perfect and  he got it right. Great book.	1999-12-08

It's not great, but its better than good.And its a good start for both beginners and more advanced students of the period and of naval and maritime history. What it does is capture more than  a ship's history. In a world where anything older than 3 months is  forgotten, a different world of long ago comes to life in color. I just  wish it was longer.	1999-08-16

It tells a lot more than I expected, and I wish it included even more.  As a parable its outstanding.  It always surprises me, our lack  of memory and the absence of history.  Maybe its possible to live only with  Star Wars, but I don't think so. Some of the comments in regard to W.  Wilson were intriguing.	1999-05-19

If forgiveness comes from understanding, then how in the world is it possible to both understand and forgive the main character that  represents two generations. How she made me responsible and participatory  in her guilt is remarkable. I congratulate the author.	1999-04-18

If the first four recipes are workable, I buy. If not, back on the shelf. This one is a keeper.<br />I have three other books by these authors. But this book  features more daring recipes, and the effect is, overall, more stunning. It  has a number of dumplings recipes, which are all great. <br />There are not  many books featuring fusion, but if this is the future, I'm buying the  ticket.	1999-02-22

The writing lacks music, it does not flow, and I have the feeling that the author was uncomfortable writing. He cannot seem to convert his love of radio into  words. BUT...He loves the medium. He loves the people, and He loves the  memory. That comes through.So, ultimately, this is a great book, because in  the end, the small errors, the lack of poetry, don't matter. What does is  the sound of the  broken topped radio that brought the world into his home  and into his head.For that, the sound of  a world fading into silence, we  should thank him.	1999-02-03

I believed that McCarthy was a monster. I remember from our black and white tv Have you no shame ?<br />Now it appears, I was wrong. Worse, my parents  were wrong, their friends, and their class. If not entirely, at least in  part or in degree. Its a good lesson, and maybe a sad one. And, given the  season, it makes you wonder about Virginia and Santa Claus.	1999-01-02

AND ITS A BIG PROBLEM. IT'S ONLY IN PAPERBACK.<br />THIS IS A BOOK THAT SHOULD BE KEPT, READ, RE READ, AND THOUGHT ABOUT, FOR YEARS. IT SHOULD BE A REMINDER AND A TRIBUTE FOR AS LONG AS THE  GENERATION THAT FOUGHT THE WAR, AND FOUGHT AGAINST IT, LIVES. TO DO THAT,  IT SHOULD BE HARDBOUND.	1998-12-10

It reminds me of the book by Phil Jenkins, An Acre In Time, about one space of land near Ottawa, Canada. To see our spaces over the  course of centuries is a revelation, an education,  a memory and a warning.  The production is excellent and the book should be included with every  college level history course.	1998-11-29

Although not a civil war buff, I have always  been curious about the war, but never able to appreciate the huge sweep of  events. This book does two things. It makes understandable the battle of  Gettysburg and its precedents, and it reminds us that the men who fought  there and survived continued to live for many years, with other lives than  four years of war.  It does one other thing. It shows us that man fought  man, one winning, one losing, but together. I'm both saddened and heartened  by their  stories, now far away and long ago.	1998-09-15
