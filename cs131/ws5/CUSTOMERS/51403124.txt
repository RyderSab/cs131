I never expected a man to write a female character so well, with humor, truth, it is right on the mark. I also did not expect to like it as much as I did, because Bill Gordon started the story with so many characters, that at first it is difficult to get them quite straight, but suddenly the book just takes off, and you are in Mary Nolan's world of family, friends, aunts, you name it.  Plot driven, character driven, and it just rings true. Read this book!	2005-02-17

It begins with the death of an unknown man in Florida and goes back in time to his history of marriages with three Mrs. Kimbles over a time span of thirty years.  We see how well he can seduce and court these women, but he does not have it in him to carry out the relationships.  He leaves the first one, a young woman named Birdie, with two young children.  She cannot manage to live whithout him so she finds herself drinking wine to excess, totally unable to cope.  These pages are particularly painful because we see the effect this has on her life and her two young children, Charles and Jody.  We watch them grow up and meet the other wives, once as a product of Ken Kimble absconding with them to Florida to meet and live with wife number 2, Joan Kimble, who of course believes his lies.  Dinah is wife number 3, who actually was the babysitter for Birdie's children.  Dinah has a son, Benjamin, and much of the whole group minus, Mr Ken Kimble, of course, come together.  This is done very nicely, and without feeling contrived.  We never really know Ken Kimble, except as a seducer and cad, who only piles on the charm at the beginning of any relationship, especially when the women are young.<br />This is not a perfect novel, but it is really very good, worth reading, and of course you don't put it down without thinking about these characters for a bit when you are done.	2004-01-20

I cannot say enough superlatives for this book and the Hill family that Nancy Clark has created.  It is funny, character-driven, (with an emphasis on characters), and never failed to keep me interested.  It is the year or so long story of the large and extended Hill family who have come to stay with and do not leave their Aunt Lily's home in Massachusetts. On the surface, it looks like nothing happens, but we watch the Hills' lives change over the year, and yes, they finally do leave.  It takes place around the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and even the Ramones have a brief cameo in the book, which I loved. (Joey Ramone so loved being present at the fall of the Berlin Wall).  Take the time to read this book if you love well-drawn, interesting, funny characters, if you delight in a long chattery sentence, and want to be with Hills once you have finished the book. We may get our chance, because Nancy Clark is working on a second novel about the Hills, and I want to see what Lily, Ginger, Harvey, Becky, and the group have been doing. This is great reading.	2004-01-07

Cassandra Mortmain, the young narrator, writes this a journal that takes place over six months, while she works on her writing. But this never feels like a journal, instead it is well-written,and joyful, with all the melodrama one would expect from a teenage girl.  The Mortmains have been living in poverty in a castle in England, because after Father was released from a three-month stint in jail, after the \\"cake-knife incident\\" in their neigborhood, he wanted to live in the country. They had been living on the profits of his first and famous book, \\"Jacob Wrestling,\\" but he has a serious case of writer's block, eccentricity, and questions are raised about his sanity. With little income, their home is falling apart, many of their belonging have been sold off for food, we watch their fortunes change when Neil and Simon Cotton move in next door.  Cassandras's sister, Rose, her brother, Timothy,  stepmother, Topaz, and the lovesick Stephen all live in the castle, interesting people all.  Throw in the wealthy Cottons who move in next door, and we add love and engagements, Simon loves Rose, Rose doesn't love Simon, Neil hates Rose, and Cassandra of course, loves Simon.  There are many more interesting characters who do not overshadow the  plot while we watch Cassandra change during the course of her journal.  Fabulous story!	2004-01-03

Mission Flats begins twenty years ago when a cop is murdered in a bar, and his killer commits suicide by jumping off the Tobin Bridge in Boston.  Then we go to Versailles, Maine, to the murder of a Boston district attorney, found by Ben Truman, police captain a town where not too much happens. Back and forth to Maine and Boston, until we slowly learn how and why so many characters are linked. The ending was a knock-out surprise, and well done by the author. The mysteries and secrets in this book are exquisite for a debut novel, and you will not be able to rest until you know them all.  The mark of a good book for me is that I thought about the characters for hours after I finished the book, and as a voracious reader I was not ready to start a new book until I could let them go.	2003-10-12

It is a gripping mystery, though the ending is not quite a surprise, it does not take away from the story, the characters, and the sharply written prose.  Two girls go to India, meet up with a third, and one of the original two does not come back. With India as background, the anxiety of travel without tourism, the coming of age, the secrets, mystery, and guilt, this is a fabulous book.  You can read this book in a day, simply because you will not want to put it down.	2003-05-06

Morality for Beautiful Girls, the third book of the series, just continues to please.  Mma Precious Mamotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni, as are all the characters in this novel are such complete, carefully drawn people that is wonderful to be with them once again.  Mma Mamotswe runs a detective agency but what she really does is help people with problems in their lives.  She looks at life in a balanced and faithful way, and she lives a good life, expecting others not always to do the same.  In this book we see her give her secretary more responsibility and authority and it does nothing but good. I love the way Alexander McCall Smith describes Africa, and I feel like I am there.  This is a wonderful, fabulous book--read it, read the series!  After this, it is to The Kalarai Typing School for Men for me.	2003-03-29

Julie Otsuka used the viewpoint of a different family member in each chapter and it was both stunning and seamless.  I loved this book. It is sad and at times painful, and inasmuch as it was difficult to read about the family being uprooted, the father taken away in his robe and slippers, I found their return home even more poignant. Who were the people who lived in their home while this family was interned? Who touched their belongings and where is the rosebush that was in the yard? This is a wonderful book, and it's hard to believe that is a debut novel.	2003-01-30

Theresa is a 15 year old wonderchild, who is not only beautiful, but blessed in her ability to take care of other peoples' children.  She cares for her cousin, Daisy, Flora, the daughter of a local artist, and a host of Moran children, and Swansons.  What drives this book is that beautiful prose McDermott uses throughout--clean and lovely, never wasteful. You know there will be trouble ahead by the easy bruising on Daisy, and I found it a little unsettling that Theresa does not mention it to any adults, and that her own parents do not notice either. But in this world, parents do not seem to notice their children, why would they notice a bruised foot? Only a physician parent notices, but he is too busy giving Theresa the eye, and asking her for babysitting time.<br />Last Night is still my sentimental favorite Alice McDermott book, but this is a close second.  A lovely book, with characters you won't forget.  It's a slim volume that should not be read too quickly, savor it instead.	2002-12-03

I had sworn off negative reviews, but this long book of adverbs and meandering paragraphs, and let us not forget the additional parentheses in far too many sentences has had my reading attention for far too long! I wanted to like Harriet and her quest to find and convict her dead brother's murderer, but the book is just so flat. We have Harriet and her large family of aunts, caretakers, her absent father, the car salesman, the gross-out of all snake-handler and his boxes of snakes. Then the Ratcliffe family, and frankly the only time the pages come alive--except for the horrible snakes--is when the Ratcliffes are present. I stuck with this book until the bitter end, and the only part about the end of the book that was sweet, is that it was finally over. Now I am be free of those pesky adverbs and parentheses that Ms Tartt finds so appealing. Oh, the pain!	2002-11-15

The prose is wonderful, the kind of writing where you go back over sentences to feel the beauty and the craft of a perfect phrase--over and over.  I haven't read a book like this in so long, it had no cliches, no tiresome plot devices, just a funny, sad, sweet, well thought out story.  Kimmel brings the characters together in a perfectly believeable way, it always rings true. Spend a few days (you don't want to give this book up too soon) with Langston, Amos, Germane, Alice's the sweet wounded daughters and all the major and minor characters that are written so clearly. Read it at least once!	2002-09-17

The story hinges on the relationship of Maria and her cousin, Tsugumi whose behavior becomes out of control, but apparently forgiven because of her chronic unnamed illness. Maria lives in a seaside inn with her mother, aunt, and cousins until her father brings mother and Maria to Tokyo. Maria moves back just for the summer, and eventually we get to Goodbye, Tsugumi. The plot was so-so, but the dialog hurt the most, often to the point where it felt jarring. I always like to give Yoshimoto's books a whirl, maybe it's because of that Banana as a first name. She is worth reading, so try her first novel, Kitchen, if you want a better sample.	2002-08-24

I just loved that little Baby Otis (and naming the baby Otis, just added to his cachet) and it was wonderful watching the characters interact with him. Caroline Leavitt did such a fine job of character development with Molly, her mom, her sister, Suzanne, and her husband, Gary. I really knew these people. The story of Molly's critical illness shortly after giving birth to Otis, and how much this affected so many people was done with marvelous skill. This book is a find.	2002-08-13

The story of Sophy Chase and her almost husband takes you to Swansea, her twin stepdaughters, the first wife, and the sharply written summer (versus all year round) island life. You also get the story of her almost-boyfriend and her almost status as a stepmother to 4 adopted children, with the sharpest focus on Vicky who disappears for a few days during a particularly difficult time in Sophy's life. It might sound complicated, but it works.  This is great read, it may be a fast read, but Elizabeth Benedict's characters stay with you. I am so glad I found this book!	2002-07-16

I loved Richard Flanagan's first novel, The Sound of One Hand Clapping, and I thought the concept for this novel, was well, novel. And I thought it was creative. William Buelow Gould, the main character (or is he?) is a liar and a thief and who knows what else, sentenced to prison on Van Diemen's Land. He paints his way into a better life for a little while at least, but the story flattened out and lost me by the end. It was hard to follow, just so bleak and dark, and to stay with the story of Gould, the fish, Tasmania, prison and the horror of his life, it was too hard. If the payoff at the end were better, it might have felt worth it to stay with the novel, but the scenes and characters were horrific at times, and the story spun out of control. Read English Passengers by Matthew Kneale if you want a seafaring story mixed with Tasmania.<br />Having said all that, I will look for Richard Flanagan's second novel, Death of a River Guide. But first, some lighter reading!	2002-05-28

It may be that I loved it more having just returned from a vacation in Portugal, but so be it. The mystery is told in the present and past, and it is fun to watch the past and the Nazi mystery move closer in time to the present. What I really liked about the book was the author's ability to use every character and to good economical effect--there are no loose ends. This is a book to read on the weekend, because you won't want to put it down. And you won't want to lose your place in time, because the action goes back and forth so quickly. The added piece is the taste and sights of Portugal. Robert Wilson loves his Portuguesse food, wine, and  bicas, and he can take you to Lisbon, Cascais, and Alcantara with his writing. This is  well worth a reading.	2002-05-21

Ann Darby writes about the sixties in such a way that the reader is placed back in time--I felt like I was growing up all over again. It is ultimately the story of the young Maggie and her family, told at times in the voice of different characters; her mother, her great-aunt, sister, and brother. It's more than a coming of age novel, at times her family comes apart, then comes back together. Ann Darby is a writer I feel lucky to have found, and I am looking forward to her second novel.	2002-05-14

I cannot get this story and these characters out of my mind--I still think about them, days after I finished the book. It is the story of Piper at thirty diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer and as a teenager, and it shows the force her mother's absence brings to bear througout her throughout Piper's life. Piper stumbles through school, attracting the attention of an older man, and this is where a lesser writer would have faltered, but there is not a false note in the writing. Greenwood uses touching prose and imagery, going back and forth in time and it never feels jarring. It just flows beautifully. I am so glad I discovered T. Greenwood and I recommend this book highly.	2002-03-14

The story begins with Maria, who is leaving her daughter, Sonja, and husband, Bojan. Forever. The images and sounds of the snow falling as she leaves her daughter are absolutely one of the finest passages I have read in a long time. I went back to it after I finished the book and it meant so much more. I could feel the snow and the despair of this family acutely the second time. Richard Flanagan takes us through present and past to tell this story, using prose that speaks like poetry. There were sentences I just read repeatedly because they were written so well. It is a sad book, beyond heartbreaking at times when we see how much hurt each member of this family has borne.  There were times when I hated Bojan as much as his daughter did, but when his full story is revealed, he must be understood and forgiven.<br />The book ends with hope and redemption, and it is believeable and welcome. This book, its characters, images, and symbolism in the writing, are unforgettable.<br />This is another example of a superior novel that begs to be read by a larger audience.	2002-03-04

Kate Carr and her little family of father and Gran live a claustrophobic life together hiding secrets that are gently alluded to throughout the book. Kate is the fourteen year old girl holding the mysteries in her head that she works out slowly through dreams and shards of memory. Yes, she is deceitful and manipulative and ever so disturbed, but she is coping in that Gran and Dad world where no one is allowed to talk about her mother, the woman that left her behind. The fact that Kate feels she needs to have her school \\"friends\\" divert some of Dad's attention from her to one of them is just one part of the chill in this novel. Penelope Evans has fleshed out the major and not so minor characters so well that each has a place in my mind long after I finished this novel. This is a winner of a mystery.	2002-02-27

Once I started this novel, I could not put it down. And now I can't keep the story and characters out of my mind. I was hooked from the first sentence, \\"They are all dead now,\\" and found myself going back to the book's prologue to review how \\"they\\" found their end. The book has mystery and misery, the voice of children and adults, secrets slowly revealed, and unforgettable characters. When Ann-Marie MacDonald writes about the new home the Pipers move into. \\"...But just because it was new, doesn't mean it wasn't haunted,\\" you know you are in for a great ride of a novel. It's a very difficult book to get through, but Ann-Marie MacDonald writes so well, that it is hard to believe this is a first novel. It spares little, and should not be missed.	2002-02-18

Lionel Essrog is the central character with Tourette's syndrome, and I cannot say enough superlatives about his characterization and dialogue. I found myself thinking about Lionel long after I  finished the book; the tics, the words, the creativity, I can't say enough good things about this work.

I feel lost in a sea of glowing reviews, but I have to agree with ramson, I just didn't like this book. I couldn't see how decades of hatred could be changed in so short a period of time, it didn't ring true. The characters had no life on the page unless they were fighting with each other, and I found myself skipping paragraphs to get to some plot movement.<br />I did like the location, and many of the author's touches worked regarding the New England location, except for one.
