And this time, Grisham is delivering an international suspense thriller, which he's quite good in writing. It's all about a Washington power broker (not a stock broker as the title may lead you believe) who's released from prison under a special deal. The CIA gives him (the power broker) a new identity, etc. relocates him to Italy. Nice scenery and details about Italian life. Now, the power broker is a target to his previous \\"clients\\" from the Russians to the shady middle eastern characters to whom he had sold U.S. secrets during his \\"good\\" old days. The Broker reminds me a little bit on the in 2000 published novel by Alec Donzi \\"The Consultant\\" which is along similar lines and also an exceptional international thriller. Both books are excellent reads -- and with \\"The Broker\\" the real Grisham is back in a powerful way.	2005-01-12

I bought several books on how GarageBand works and while some had some helpful hints, the author of this book, Bob LeVitus, knows what he's talking about. Every sentence and page has valuable advice on how this thing, \\"GarageBand\\", really works. He also includes the limitations of GarageBand and alternative software suggestions for more elaborate recording needs. The author is very knowledgable about home-studio recording and he has excellent suggestions on microphones, speakers, and inexpensive technical gear incl. audio interfaces, etc. that will make your recording project a professional adventure. This book is so interesting and has so many useful tips, etc. that everyone playing around with GarageBand should read it in order to easily use this Apple application and to get the most out of it -- saving you a lot of frustration at the same time.	2004-12-08

The author describes virtually every detail incl. the emotional aspects from prevention to diagnosis and through the healing process. I picked up a copy of this extensive book when one of my friends was diagnosed with breast cancer to be able to better relate to her and to understand what she's going through and I must say it is a very interesting read. Another excellent book on the subject that is really encouraging and helpful and I think is also a \\"Must-Read\\" is \\"Breast Cancer Be-Attitudes\\" by breast-cancer survior Sylvia Baker.	2004-11-06

God's Word leads Christians to a life of Grace. While the word \\"Grace\\" is mentioned often in sermons, many pulpits don't even teach true Grace, instead they often teach works and a performance-oriented \\"Christian\\" lifestyle. It seems as if most preachers and believers just can trust God for the effectiveness of true Grace as taught in the Bible, which in fact would really changes everything. True/pure Grace is powerful. <br />At MegaGrace there are many helpful articles and resources about the true Grace of God and its practical applications. This book is excellent and every Christian should read it.	2004-10-25

With this book, Sylvia Baker wrote one of the best books on the subject of breast cancer. It takes away the fear from surgery for those women who need to go through the process and this book offers lots of hope for the recover process. Baker herself is a breast cancer survivor and has gone through the whole ordeal. She wrote the book from the heart with the purpose of edifying and encouraging the reader, while being objective regarding the issue.<br /><br />The author approaches the subject systematically, but always with the concern of the individual patient in mind. This book is highly recommended for everyone who was just been diagnosed with breast cancer or who is already in the recovery stage, and it's also a great and encouraging read for loved ones of breast cancer victims as it is a very helpful book -- one of the best books on the subject out there. Because of the excellent content, this book is just simply an encouraging read for everyone.	2004-10-25

Clearly, this book is targeted for success in the Real Estate market and that's what Donald Trump apparently knows the best. The subtitle is a little misleading, because not \\"Everything you need to know about success, real estate, and life\\" is in this book, instead there are some gems here and there and you won't find anything really profound. <br />Needless to say that the Donald is an icon, a legend of the American Dream and all success-hungry people can look to him as a shining example of that. The only sad thing was that he publicly attacked Mark Cuban which was a major mistake, because aside from Real Estate the Donald isn't doing so well with some of his other big-money businesses and much could be said about his failures in that area. For instance, how can anybody lose even a dime with a Casino when it's a 24-hour piggy bank? ... well, the Donald showed us how a potentially great Casino company can lose it all. So after all, the \\"billionaire\\" isn't that hot in every area, but granted he surely knows Real Estate I guess, and now he's the TV-star -- that's a nice little touch for a guy who is now in his late 50s. <br />Like we said, you won't read anything in this book that changes the world, but for personal gain we all can learn from Trump's extensive business/real estate experience and buying this book is an inexpensive way of learning some interesting strategies.	2004-10-15

I love it because of its unique insight. I know it's supposed to be a novel, but this book reads more like an investigative report, although the author borrows heavily from the fiction genre. What's amazing to me is the fact that this book was published in late 2000 and the author probably conceived the idea and wrote the book a few years earlier, and the results would normally qualify as a prophecy as Donzi wrote history before it actually happened. Right now we're seeing much of the content or at least the general premise and various situations fulfilled before our eyes. Nevertheless, Donzi's style is predominantly one of an investigative journalist and that takes time to get used to, but it's a work of suspense and a very interesting subject matter. I'm looking forward to the movie release, if that is in the works as the storyline in The Consultant is great film material; it would make a great action thriller.	2003-11-02

I always love to learn about subjects that interest me, and even though I may have read through dozens of books on a subject to gain the maximum know-how about it, it's always a thrill to pick up a read that is truly superb. Bryan M. Stoller, the author of Filmmaking for Dummies, has accomplished one of the best jobs on this subject matter that I've found so far over the years. He's categorical and precise and I'd call it the best Filmmaking Course on a budget. The reader can learn in this inexpensive book just as much as in many 8-week filmmaking courses that often cost thousands of dollars and the good part is that with this book you already have the notes printed in front of you. The author offers a volume of resources discussing the differences of using actual film vs. video and new 24fps digital camcorders like the Panasonic AG-DVX100 Cinema Camera. He has excellent chapters on lighting, sound and camera filters, as well as on the commercial aspect of idependent film distribution and film festivals, etc. This is a very practical, right-to-the point book and it's an enormous resource from a qualified guy who's been interested in filmmaking for a long time and who has at least 20 years of on-hand in-the-field experience. Stoller also offers very helpful Website addresses for further information, even where to buy or rent equipment, etc., etc. Every aspiring and even professional filmmaker will definitely benefit from this book. Amazingly, this book is so updated as if it was just written a few weeks ago including the newest technological developments regarding digital film formats.	2003-09-06

While the author, Paul Stevens, isn't a psychologist, he writes from a Pastor's viewpoint as he taught hundreds of relationship classes and conducted counseling sessions for well over a decade. The approach in this book is conversational which personalizes the subject matter. Instead of humanistic concepts this book brings us a biblical approach regarding relationships. It is a great read for singles as well as for married couples. Another book that I highly recommend which is also powerful and talks about a proper self image and marital relationships on a biblical basis, is Dietmar Scherf's &quot;I LOVE ME: Avoiding &amp; Overcoming Depression.&quot;	2003-05-16

It takes more than one read to really get into the story. Often, his books grow on the reader and society and years later his works are accepted by the general public. Sure, in &quot;Prey&quot; Crichton is experimental, but he's always been that way--taking risks and exploring the unusual; and this is exactly what makes good storytelling and great authors.

He talks about the rearrangement of priorities in order to gain stability in life. No matter if you're a woman or a man, the commonly accepted mood swings are in fact devastating and painful.

Over the past couple of years I've read through all the new books by Grisham, Clancy, Crichton, Harris, Patterson and others. A few books like Hannibal by Harris, The Testament by Grisham and A Man in Full by Wolfe I found worth reading. But I was searching for an international thriller and Rainbow Six by Clancy came pretty close. Then came The Consultant by Donzi and this was it. His voice is fresh and unique. He arranged the book into 76 chapters which adds to the electricity of this high-profile thriller. True, I might be biased to some degree because some parts of this novel play in my 'backyard' in Naples, but the whole story is so very engaging and extremely interesting that you just can't put this book down. Also, Donzi introduces the reader to a lifestyle on a completely different level and he makes you understand how rich folks really think. Great book: it's the best novel in years!	2002-07-20

Although no doubt that the events of 9/11 were horrific, this book is excellent in capturing this tragedy.

This book offers tremendous hope in a testimony of the human spirit ... the outpouring of the public to help the victims and their families. In another book that I just read I discovered that the danger of further attacks on our homeland isn't over, instead the real danger is imminent and such attacks would be even more widespread and devastating as the 9/11 events as explained in the high-powered thriller by Alec Donzi, THE CONSULTANT.	2002-04-03

Excellent character studies and it seems Grisham is good at that. The pacing is a little slow and the plot isn't sophisticated, but it's an enjoyable book to read and refreshing to see Grisham in action again.

By the way, Dr. Scherf's book was already published a few years ago. Anyway, both books analyze this key problem of Identity Crises in people, nations, companies, etc. Scherf has a direct, but gentle approach vs. Dr. Phil and Scherf offers a true solid identity that each person can obtain in a very relaxed way. While Dr. Phil doesn't deny his strong roots in faith and finds them essential for a fulfilled life, Scherf explains it in &quot;I Love Me&quot; extremely well why such roots of faith are extremely helpful to find a true identity and a true purpose in life to produce healing in the soul.	2002-02-06

The premise is unique and the whole setup is very interesting as two guys are trying to pull a $300 million stunt, but they're no pros and there you have the dilemma and also the fun. The exotic locale of Florida makes it almost a vacation read and if you plan one in the near future then this is the book you want to take along.

The thing about it is that in FIRE he takes the reader with him to the front lines so to speak. Junger is the essence of an investigative reporter, brave and detailed in his pursuit of the extraordinary adventure. The whole book is like A Perfect Storm of which he too is the author. In times like this, it's great to have a guide (Junger) who offers an inside peak behind the scenes of global events. Another author who is talented in this regard and who too is an investigative reporter and takes the reader to the front lines so to speak is Alec Donzi, and his thriller about the reality of global nuclear terrorism, THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi, is a chilling account of what the future may hold for mankind.	2001-10-03

I read this book just recently and the events of Sept.11,01 had at least some similarities: a jet that explodes, radical muslims involved and so forth. The author, Mr. Rushdie received a death sentence from the Iranian Kohmeni regime for this book, and Rushdie lives in hiding somewhere in England. This book was certainly a type of prophecy but it also provides us with vital insight into the mind of some islamic fundamentalists. Interesting. Another book that I highly recommend which talks about the modern-day nuclear terrorism at a completely new level and which might be a powerful prophecy is THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2001-09-18

This book explains the terrors of germ warfare, especially if such bombs and devices get into the hands of terrorists and other crazies. The authors did excellent research and show how someone could build one of these bombs for the fraction of the cost what a nuclear device would cost. Scary to say the least. Another new book that I just read and highly recommend as it explains very realistically the danger of nuclear terrorism in our time is THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2001-09-18

The motives and agendas of terrorists are analyzed and we get a very good picture of how international terrorism works as we even get a glimpse into the minds of such dangerous characters. Another book that explains the next step of terrorism with the reality of very dangerous and devastating nuclear terrorist attacks is the powerful thriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2001-09-14

This is a great book with lots of highly interesting information. &quot;The New Jackals&quot; was definitely a warning and we all should have taken it seriously and should have done something about it a long time ago.

Craven takes us into a world of the global power struggle of the super powers. It seems as if the Cold War isn't over yet and after reading this book we understand even more why the U.S. needs a Missile Defense System. Another book that I've enjoyed on the subject, although it is presented as a novel, in fact it contains lots of real-life facts and information about the secret threats, and it is also a type of expose so to speak, is the powerful megathriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2001-08-28

This book is not the typical heavy brain-squeezing Spence novel, but instead it's a rather fast-paced easy read and I'm sure it will introduce a lot of new readers to Spence. There aren't that many books in this type of setting that deal and describe this particular era in the way this author does. Another loaded thriller that I found excellent and which deals with the modern-day China/Far East plot to become the leading world power is Alec Donzi's THE CONSULTANT.	2001-04-09

Great sales and negotiating skills are explained and &quot;The Art of War&quot; is a &quot;Must-Read&quot; for the serious contender. It contains ancient Chinese wisdom that is still applicable in our modern world. An amazing read! To find out more about the current application and realistic scenario of China's global takeover strategy and techniques, you may want to consider the powerful, fast-paced edgy novel THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2001-04-03

No, it's not a legal thriller and matter of fact it's not even a thriller. It's a cute little story--almost in Falkner tradition--about a cotton pickin' kid in the South about half a century ago. I read the book in less than 2 days and I like it. This is an absolutely new Grisham and the cover already hinted that it would be. Grisham is a good writer and &quot;A Painted House&quot; shows his skill. For thriller fans I very much recommend the powerful megathriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi who perhaps will now take Grisham's place in the thriller category.	2001-02-07

I think it is one of his best works. Yes, it's different, but it's a book by a seasoned writer who plays with words, applies excellent charaterization, and pays attention to detail. &quot;Code to Zero&quot; is not your typical breathtaking thriller, but it's an interesting book and time well spent. If you prefer a fast-past thriller, I highly recommend the new powerful megathriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2001-01-30

Traffic is very realistic. Soderbergh, the cast and the film crew did an excellent job. To have the shooting script is another advantage and for film aficionados and film students this screenplay is a &quot;Must&quot; in their collection and valuable resource material. Another powerful thriller that I've recently come across and I very much recommend as the scenes come alive from the written page with one scene after the other like in a movie, is the very realistic and edgy thriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2001-01-27

In his new book, Bill Gertz lays the cards face up. Supported by solid research, his claim that China is a threat to the national security of the U.S. and the world is absolutely validated. The nuclear threat is to be taken seriously considering China's philosophy and a population of over a billion people. This book is highly recommended as it provides a good overview and lots of interesting details regarding this subject. Another excellent book that discusses the nuclear threat via China and North Korea, although it's supposedly fiction but vaguely based on a declassified CIA report, is the very realistic new high-profile thriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2001-01-18

What I liked in this book is the &quot;fantastic&quot; realism similar to the art world and the unpredictable development of events and the behavior of the main characters. By the way, characterization is exceptionally well done, although it may have slowed down the pace quite a bit. Still, you can't put the book down: it just goes on and you want to know what happens next. This book is a little different than other Koontz novels, but it's a great read. For a faster-paced thriller with intricate plotting and breathtaking action, I highly recommend THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi which I just read over the holidays.	2001-01-08

This thriller is fast paced and the plotting is intricate. The characters are deeper in Roses are Red, although Patterson continues his style with short sentences, paragraphs and chapters which speed up the pace. In this book, Cross is on the trail of a killer-crazy bankrobber who employs special techniques of terror, just right for Cross to get involved. This novel is a thrillride; I certainly enjoyed it. Another fast-paced thriller that was recommended to me, and after reading it, now I highly recommend it as I thought it was a mind blowing novel, is the intelligent action thriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2000-12-27

While I found that the characterizations aren't that deep in The Bear &amp; The Dragon, Clancy spends a lot of time on the main plot, which is concerning China's desire to rule the world and how they might go about accomplishing it. Also, Clancy spends a lot of time on subplots and overall the story is well executed. I didn't like the excessive use of foul language which is absolutely unnecessary and it spoiled the book to some degree. Anyway, reading this Clancy is an experience. Another new thriller that features a possible China world domination scenario, but is faster paced than Clancy, and it is a very informative book, although it's plenty of entertaining, is the loaded action thriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2000-12-27

While Ken Follett's novels are always exciting reads as he pays a lot of attention to detail, this book is set in a time some of us may still remember, namely the late 1950s. Characterization is deep as usual and while Code to Zero is not necessarily a high-profile thriller, the story touches on some high concepts in the masterplan so to speak, but is played out in the details of the lives of various individuals. And the story keeps on moving. Obvious is Follett's knack and expertise for historical research; no matter if he writes about something centuries ago or closer to the recent past, he writes about the subject with authority. Another fast-paced thriller that I strongly recommend and which is set in the present, is the explosive new thriller by Alec Donzi called THE CONSULTANT.	2000-12-11

The characters are well developed and the plot has plenty of twists and turns. I think The Last Precinct is one of her best books so far, although some lose ends are not tied together at the end. And I'm not fond of the lesbian emphasis in that certain character, but it's an interesting read and a great follow-up to Black Notice. As I'm more of an international thriller fan, I just finished a tremendous new book by a new author, and this book I really read from cover to cover over the weekend as it's suspenseful, a story that keeps your face glued to the page, which is THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi.	2000-12-11

The tribulation period begins, as the Bible refers to it. &quot;Left Behind&quot; shows us that it's no fun to be left behind, and tells this biblical principles in a story of the main characters. The tension keeps on going, from page to page and it's a highly interesting read. It's time to consider a few things in your life. Another book that is highly recommended as it deals very realistically with the nearing end of humanity and the threat of supernukes in the Far East, is the powerful megathriller &quot;The Consultant&quot; by Alec Donzi.	2000-11-28

It's something you want to read, then ponder this thought and that profound principle as it will have a positive impact upon your life, if such wisdom is seriously considered. Among the other treasures of wisdom with substantial content and important lessons for life, books you simply don't want to miss are &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; by Mitch Albom and &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding &amp; Overcoming Depression&quot; by Dietmar Scherf.	2000-11-20

In fact I didn't like the excessive foul language throughout the book. The story is still interesting, but it goes on forever. If Clancy would have used more contemporary locations for this thriller and not the traditional surroundings, it would have been a much better book. I'm sure this book is going to make a good movie, if they cut out the bad language. Based on a friend's recommendation I just read through another brand new thriller in this genre and I highly recommend it as it is fast paced, loaded with action, excellent plot, info and research and plausible scenarios, which is the explosive megathriller &quot;THE CONSULTANT&quot; by Alec Donzi.	2000-11-14

It has quite some wisdom in it, although you don't want to take it too serious. Most of us have problems with change and it usually starts when our schedule becomes messed up and lunch is delayed for an hour or whatever. This little guide gives some advice how we all can adapt to these little and maybe bigger changes in everyday life. It's well worth the read. Recently I also read a book that contains a valuable chapter on 'Trying to change the Unchangeable' and as a whole is a very helpful guide to a fulfilled life, which is Dietmar Scherf's &quot;I LOVE ME: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression.&quot;	2000-11-14

In &quot;The Mark&quot; the second half of the Great Tribulation takes place and it can be helpful to read at least the first book in the series, this one &quot;Left Behind&quot; to understand the basis of the story completely. &quot;Left Behind&quot; although based on Biblical truth turns out to be a thriller with the assurance that these things will take place.

There are surprising twists and turns. The beginning is a little slow, but as the story goes on the book intensifies significantly to the end as it also offers an enganging ending -- well done indeed. Another thriller that I just read and I thought was awesome as it is fast paced and plays on an international level is the new intelligent and explosive megathriller by Alec Donzi &quot;The Consultant.&quot;	2000-11-07

Another brand new book that explains the whole scenario extremely well in form of a novel, although the book is based on a (de)classified CIA report, and it's a breathtaking thriller and strongly recommended, is Alec Donzi's &quot;The Consultant.&quot;	2000-10-31

I like the international intrigue in it as he takes us on a journey around the world where there are terrorist activities everywhere. Who's behind it all? Well that's a surprise. There's plenty of action and suspenseful scenarios. I also appreciated that this book is kept shorter than his previous works which makes this book a faster read. Another brand new book that I enjoyed a lot and it is strongly recommended as it is along the lines of Ludlum's new book, but it is faster paced is the international megathriller &quot;The Consultant&quot; by Alec Donzi.	2000-10-31

This book covers a very interesting subject and that kept me going, because this time, the characters weren't that interesting. And it is a very long book. I'm sure it was a lot of work to write this novel and I respect that, but sometimes it seems as if an editor should have just ripped out this section and that paragraph. Anyway, if you have some time to spare then this book might a great way to enjoy a good read. In comparison I just read a brand new 400-page thriller by a new author which covers a similar topic of nuclear terrorism, and it's fast-paced and I read it in less than 2 days, which is the highly recommended new high-profile megathriller by Alec Donzi called &quot;The Consultant.&quot;	2000-10-26

Another book  that I highly recommend as it is so very helpful, and which has been  written by a man who is frequently assigned the title of Dr. Laura's twin  brother, is Dietmar Scherf's &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding &amp; Overcoming  Depression.&quot;	2000-09-07

The book explains in detail depression episodes and  analyzes its root problems, then offers specific help to break that vicious  pattern of depression. A good read for anyone suffering from depression,  and it's also good for prevention.

As Scherf appears to honestly care about the well-being of each  individual, he makes them face the music with much love and care. But he  doesn't applaud or even support self-pity, as he knows that only the truth  presented in love will bring healing. After reading this book I'm positive  that you can say 'Good-bye' to depression.	2000-07-13

It's an excellent resource for studying the Bible. It's just as valuable for new Christians as it is helpful for mature believers. The book  contains 52 vital doctrines of the Bible, the cardinal doctrines that are  essential for the understanding of Christianity and a Christian's growth.  It features chapters on the &quot;Bible,&quot; &quot;God the Son,&quot;  &quot;God the Trinity,&quot; &quot;God the Holy Spirit,&quot;  &quot;Satan,&quot; &quot;Man,&quot; &quot;The Church,&quot; &quot;The  Second Coming of Christ,&quot; and so much more. At the end of each chapter  it has a short test which will be very helpful in Bible study groups as  well as for individual studies. Everything is explained in an  easy-to-understand format and it also discusses various viewpoints of a  certain doctrine. This book is also helpful as a quick reference guide.

We haven't found a better slang dictionary yet. It has virtually all the slang words in there, words that you just won't find  anywhere else. One of the very nice and helpful features is that it tells  you in what year the word was used first and susequently, and in which  publication (book or newspaper, etc.), and how the meaning changed over the  course of the decades. The dictionary also has sentence examples on how the  word was used, e.g. in which context, so you know exactly when and how to  use it in your applications. It's just very interesting to find out the  original meaning and usage of certain slang words and to enrich your own  vocabulary. We highly recommend it!	2000-06-30

There's also a small pronunciation guide included,  but it can help tremendously if you know at least some German to better  understand Yiddish. For my part, I didn't have a problem at all with  pronunciation of the Yiddish words. You'll also find 1001 Yiddish proverbs  with English translations in this dictionary, and it's fun to go through  these mostly one liners. I find this dictionary extensive enough to  research and learn at least some basic Yiddish as it also features short  sentences. It's a lot of fun to read through it, but it's also very  interesting, and everybody interested in languages as well as every fiction  and nonfiction writer should have this dictionary, ... it's the best  resource on this subject that I've found so far.	2000-06-30

Her story shows us  that nobody is perfect, although we may have a strong faith in God. It's a  thick book all right, and it's not an easy read, but once you've read The  Poisonwood Bible, you know you've read a book with excellent  characterization, first-class narrative, interesting dialogues and a  gripping tale of survival. For practical Christianity though, I recommend a  non-fiction book by Dietmar Scherf called &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding and  Overcoming Depression&quot; which will shed a lot of light on important  aspects of true faith.	2000-06-28

This book is probably one of the best grammar books out there, and it is absolutely a &quot;Must-Read&quot; for every writer (fiction and nonfiction, also journalists should read through it). The author is clear  and precise in her explanations of grammatical concepts and possibilities,  and she makes grammar fun. Some conventional approaches to grammar are  challenged in this book, but the author Constance Hale--who currently  teaches at U.C. Berkeley--is a qualified professional in her field. She's a  maverick and she offers a healthy dose of motivation to be creative with  your use of grammar in the new millenium. This book can really help to  equip a writer with this certain edge in his or her writing projects.	2000-05-29

This book is very encouraging and I think especially  cancer patients will find in it tremendous comfort and even hope. Healthy  folks will love to read this book too, and they'll come away thanking God  for their health.

In this book, Arnold Schwarzenegger's precious wife puts things into focus. She's blunt and direct, explaining that success is not that easy to come by and success is never a freebee. The book contains lots of valuable  lessons on life and it's a life guide and to many perhaps even a life  &quot;guard&quot; so to speak. Mrs. Shriver is honest about her own  challenges to live up to the measurements of her parents and now being a  parent and so forth. In short: it's an excellent book.

While I'm counting on encountering depression attacks, thanks to the  &quot;I Love Me&quot; book, I think I'm now able to withstand these  attacks. Finally, my ten-year long bout with depression seems to have  ended.

Dr. Scherf has done his research as he, too, once suffered from manic depression and has  been healed from it since the early 80s. This book cuts to the heart of the  matter in a very loving way, and the author doesn't compromise when it  comes to the crucial issues that need to be dealt with, so that healing of  depression can take place. I think that's what the critics don't like: Dr.  Scherf is very direct, but he has a kind and loving approach. For the  spiritual aspect of this book, he uses biblical principles that are so  true, but he leaves every reader a freedom of choice to accept his research  results or reject them. I think this book is something every person should  read, no matter if they're depressed or not, because it is a motivating  book, and it discusses absolutes and convictions that we're all struggling  with, and &quot;I Love Me&quot; provides us with many answers on these key  issues.	2000-01-25

Fact is that these diet tips don't require much  discipline, it's more of a rearrangement of when what to eat, and of  course, leaving out some 'unnecessary' foods. For the few bucks the book  cost, it's money well spent to give it a try. Aside from the physical  aspect, I also encourage readers to balance their psychological and  spiritual lives in order to be consistent in their dieting behavior,  therefore I highly recommend another very valuable and helpful book, which  is Dietmar Scherf's &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming  Depression&quot; also available at Amazon.	2000-01-04

But now I understand. Although I'm a joyous person in general, there are these strange 'blue Mondays' if you know what I mean,  and I know I was a real jerk. That's probably why most of my relationships  didn't last too long, I guess. This book has produced a positive attitude  within me and I no longer get ticked off by various things. As usual,  medicine isn't always tasty, but getting healthy is desirable...and in  comparison this book is quality medicine.	1999-12-21

Of course, this read will be a delight throughout any season as it brings us back to the  essential issues of life, and the author makes us think hard about our  priorities in life. I also recommend another book that in a very practical  manner deals with very important key issues of life, which is Dietmar  Scherf's &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression&quot; as it is  also available at Amazon.	1999-12-16

I gave up seeing my psycho therapist a long time ago, and after Prozac &amp; Co. couldn't help me either, I also discontinued with 'conventional' medication. Various herbal supplements helped me a lot and some books have  helped me too. But it wasn't until I read Dr. Scherf's &quot;Avoiding &amp;  Overcoming Depression&quot; book a few times that I felt that I was healed  from depression completely. I can't even pinpoint what it was in this book  that changed everything for the better; I just know that I'm no longer  depressed, and I recommend it to everyone who has depressive mood swings.	1999-12-15

The book starts out with a chapter on Identity Crisis and Self-Analysis, but not in the usual psycho lingo. Instead this book is down to earth. I remember, about a year ago, the nationwide discussions that this book  initiated, are currently found everywhere. The spiritual aspect will be  challenging to some while others will receive powerful relief. But why  accept superficial solutions when this book handles the answers in a  practical fashion. As I said, I obtained this book about a year ago and my  life has never been the same. If I need encouragement, then I read parts of  this book and apply the very powerful tips and hints in &quot;I Love  Me.&quot;	1999-12-15

It's so positive and full of energy that I couldn't put it down. The author  addresses virtually every subject with competence and he has excellent  insight and he offers strategic tips to combat depression. One major reason  that this book is so good and helpful, is probably the fact that the author  also suffered from depression for over ten years or so, and that he himself  has been free from it for 15-20 years. Truly a great book!	1999-12-08

It's a loving story of an old man, who's dying, and a young man chasing the American dream, and finally he's learning the most important  lesson in life. Together with purchasing this book, you may also want to  consider to give another book that also deals with the most important  issues in life, to your sad friends, which is Dietmar Scherf's &quot;I Love  Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression&quot; also at Amazon.	1999-12-08

It's a sweet story and touchy. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that while in this great last lesson of life, and the frequent discussions of subjects like death,  God wasn't mentioned once. It's human wisdom, and the conclusions are that  love always wins, and that to forgive every day is important. But still,  it's a great book and it brings redemption in focusing our lives back to  the real issues. One other book that I really liked and that deals with the  most important issues of life, this book does it from a spiritual  viewpoint, although remaining practical in its application, is Dietmar  Scherf's &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression&quot; -- also  available at Amazon.com	1999-12-06

An old guy teaches a young guy the lessons of life, but the young guy doesn't listen, and only later in life he adheres to the wise advice. While the ending is sad, this  ending was expected from the beginning of the book anyway. Sure, you're  gonna shed some tears, but any attentive reader can unearth treasures of  advice for life. Another book that I found very interesting as it contains  also this type of mentor mentality with much helpful advice is Dietmar  Scherf's 'I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression'-- also sold at  Amazon.	1999-11-25

Gladly, Tis isn't as sad as the first installment. Still, the foul language could've been left out. Other than that it's a great memoir and an  interesting portrait of our society. This book goes well with 'Tuesdays  with Morrie' even though I like 'Tuesdays with Morrie' better, and it also  is a great combination with Diemtar Scherf's 'I Love Me: Avoiding and  Overcoming Depression' which you may need after you read Tis, and is also  available at Amazon.	1999-11-25

In this book I found ways how to live a successful and healthy life. I used to be moody and I was aggressive toward my mother, but ever since I read this book,  improvements are happening fast. So I don't understand the negative critics  of this book...I think they're in desperate need of 'I Love Me' because  they must be a bunch of very depressed and rebellious people that just  don't want to face the truth. Well, I've written to the Scherf headquarters  and I received very informative material from them and as I can see it,  many thousands of people have been healed from depression. These facts  should shut up any critic if they have a brain, because this book has done  so much good in my life, and I know it has helped many other people too.	1999-11-25

A self-made billionaire commits suicide. When his last will is discovered, it is mind-boggling to the supposed-to-be heirs. He leaves his vast fortune to  one of his children, Rachel. But she's enstranged to her father, and has  given her life to God as a missionary in the jungles of Brazil. Now, the  lawyers have to find her, which is not an easy task. In the meanwhile, the  supposed-to-be heirs are circling like vultures, trying to overturn the  'insane' will. The story is suspenseful, heart-warming, adventurous, and  beautifully written. It's also a picture of human nature, and the story  carries a rare genuine redemptive byline. Really a good book!	1999-11-25
