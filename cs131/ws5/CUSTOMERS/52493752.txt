But alas, I got as far as page 500 (over half-way!) and just decided that LIFE IS TOO SHORT to keep reading bad fiction.<br /><br />I noticed that Amazon is offering a deal on this novel together with Nick Hornby's \\"A Long Way Down\\"...just get that one.	2005-08-08

US	52493752	R2PUPFF4SW2DMM	0747553068	645852095	The Paper Eater	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Spooky	After reading Liz Jensen's most recent novel, \\"The Ninth Life of Louis Drax\\", I was avid to read her earlier works. All are wonderful social satires, and several are also \\"speculative fiction\\" about dystopic societies. \\"The Paper Eater\\" tells of one such dystopia, an island called Atlantica where the inhabitants are kept happy with shopping and aromatherapy while the very land beneath them erodes away from toxic waste. The corporation that runs the island decides to blame the ecological failures on terrorists.<br /><br />An amazing thing about this about this novel is that it was written BEFORE 9/11 and yet explores the use of fear to control, as well as the willingness of a society to trade rights for safety.<br /><br />In short, I highly recommend all of Liz Jensen's wonderful stories. She can be favorably compared to Britain's other great social satirist, Fay Weldon.	2005-06-27

Her selection of these three Faulkner novels will most certainly turn off burgeoning readers who will surely be frustrated enough to vow never to read another book. How sad.<br /><br />What is with this idea that if a book is difficult to read/follow, and demands copious amounts of time and effort on the part of the reader that it \\"must be good\\".  Faulkner is not worth the pay-out. He requires an intense amount of study and then in the end, you don't even have that great of a story!<br /><br />I'm not afraid to say that \\"the Emperor has no clothes\\" when it comes to Faulkner. If you've tried to slog through his stuff and are tempted to blame YOURSELF - don't! You aren't dumb, you aren't illiterate, and you aren't the only one \\"not getting it\\".

All the females in it care only for the approval and notice of males.  Whether the female character is the 13 year old girl, the 30 year old college professor, or the 50 year old cancer patient, she will lie back passively and offer herself up to any male who wants to \\"fill\\" her. They open themselves to let men put whatever they want to in them; penises, foreign objects, diseases, silicone breasts, babies, and then medical tools to scrape the babies out. It's the ultimate portrait of women as disposable sex objects. Yet every single woman in the novel is complicit in her own destiny; they can't be painted as victims because they are always making their own bad choices. Every single female character is of above average intelligence, possesses plenty of financial resources and family who love them. So WHY?  Just so that they are attractive to men.<br /><br />If, in the end, they all - or even a few of them - learned that you can live a perfectly happy and fulfilling life without being a gaping hole for every Y-chromosome that passes your way, then this whole depressing journey might have been worthwhile.  But guess what? No such luck.<br /><br />Read this book, watch an episode of \\"Elim-a-date\\" or \\"The Bachelor\\" and weep for the sheer stupidity of the women of the 21st century.	2004-09-14

What is so intriguing is that this work, set 200 years ago manages to mirror TODAY'S social and political climate quite eerily.  (Maybe some things really don't ever change.) Social hypocrisy and the importance of a woman's reputation (at least on the surface) are the core themes in the novel.<br /><br />The story revolves around the lives of three central and real-life characters; high-born sculptress, Anne Damer, low-born actress, Eliza Farren and aristocrat, Lord Derby. The back-drop is late 18th century England as rebellion, revolution and equality (for males) are becoming world-wide issues.  References to gay issues, weapons of mass destruction, homeland security, terrorism and the minimum wage are all in this story that is told 200 years later.<br /><br />\\"Life Mask\\" is a thoroughly satisfying read and would make a spectacular movie.  Those who enjoyed \\"Slammerkin\\", and \\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\" will love this new work by Emma Donoghue.	2004-09-10

It's a perfect rendering of a marriage mistake. Trust me. If \\"Breathing Lessons\\" gave us a day in the life of a marriage, then \\"The Amateur Marriage\\" gives us the whole of two people's (Michael and Pauline) adult lives, and in so telling, gives us the social history of the last half of the 20th century.<br />If I was put on that proverbial desert island with only one author's works, it would be Anne Tyler's...may she write for a hundred years.	2004-01-12

All the characters are interesting, whether they be alive, dead, or dead-but-don't-know it. One character is so far removed from the narrative that she is almost a &quot;hear-say&quot; character, and yet she is a catalyst and integral to the story.

I've been a huge Atwood fan since I was in high school and have read all her novels and short stories, but I think &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; has moved into the top spot as my favorite Margaret Atwood novel; it's simply riveting.  I started the novel tight after seeing British director, Danny Boyle's new movie &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and it couldn't have been better timing.  Both stories contain a fast acting virus that decimates the planet and both stories keep you &quot;on the edge of your seat&quot;.  Atwood's dystopia is all the more harrowing because it's based on bio-technology that is ALREADY in play, perhaps already being misused.  Her phrase to describe some of the horror: &quot;unintended consequences&quot; is darkly humorous.<br />I don't often read science fiction (and this isn't) or speculative fiction (this is) because I often find the genres tough reading; too much techno-babble, too &quot;out there&quot;.

US	52493752	R1MCBZP88XHGET	1565123824	136695014	Single Wife	Books	3	13	20	N	N	Unbelievable	To enjoy Nina Solomon's first novel &quot;Single Wife&quot; one must first suspend one's disbelief that any modern, educated woman could be this dense, this out-of-touch with reality, this subjugated, this intentionally obtuse, this unimaginative and this phenomenally incurious. Oh, and for this story to work she also has to be rich, coddled, and basically stupid.<br />This is not to say that it isn't an enjoyable read, because it is. The premise is interesting; a young woman desperately keeping up the appearance that her husband hasn't left her. And if the reader can keep from being frustrated by this immature dim wit, he or she will enjoy various literary allusions such as those to &quot;The Odyssey&quot; (Penelope weaving while her husband is away) and the 1944 thriller &quot;Gaslight&quot; (Charles Boyer tries to make Ingrid Bergman think she's nuts by dimming the lights).<br />Solomon's writing is good and I'll definitely try her next novel. I'm hoping for something a little more believable, thought.	2003-06-09

Many of us mothers have been mulling myriad questions about the teens who have participated in school shootings over the past few years and I was interested in a view of that issue.  I wanted &quot;why&quot; answers, who doesn't? But of course things aren't that black and white.<br />Shriver draws us into the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of a child who can only be described as a &quot;bad seed&quot;, a cold mother and a delusional father. We know from the onset that this hurricane produces no happy ending, in fact the ending is even sadder than we anticipate, although there is a glimmer...<br />I have to pick at one slight nit about the reference to military academies (like West Point and Annapolis) as being for troubled or recalcitrant boys. Nothing is further from the truth. Our military academies take the cream of the crop (both male and female and only 1% of those who apply) to become U.S. military officers. I think the author was actually referring to military schools which are quite another thing.	2003-06-04

I was relatively enjoying \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" until page 72 when Ms. Weisberger takes on the city of Houston as if she was being paid by the Southern Stereotypes of America.  She refers to my hometown as the following: \\"city of misery\\", \\"Third World\\", \\"swamp\\" - to name a few.<br />Now, I can take a ribbin' - in fact there are plenty of things about Houston to poke fun at. But this was vitriol, not humor.  I thought about pointing out that a city with the 4th largest museum system, a world-class ballet, a Grammy winning opera company and a Tony award winning theater probably shouldn't be called Third World...but what's the point?  I hope Ms. Weisberger comes to Houston on a book tour.  She will find the people very friendly and courteous... even though we have those horrid southern accents she hates (New Yorkers sound like music?)<br />So I'm returning my copy for a full refund.	2003-05-22

This is a vast and engrossing novel and when I heard it was to be made a movie I could see how attractive that prospect would be to a filmmaker since the novel is so evocative. A good film maker could draw out even more the sights and sounds (if not the smells, thank you!) of the era as well as the drama (and humor) of the story.  When I read that Kurstin Dundst is to play Sugar I was thrilled because I think she could be just right for the part...IF...if if if the screenwriter is true to Michael Faber's story.  I began to worry that it could be turned into a \\"love story\\" with Rackman cast with a handsome heartthrob. WHAT a mistake that would be...Rackman is a selfish rake who loves no one more than himself.  He buys Sugar only so that no one else may have her and then tires of he when she becomes too available. If they turn it into \\"Pretty Woman\\" I'll cry. And it's possible because they guy who did \\"Pretty Woman\\" (and sent the message to the young women of America that prostitution is a viable path to true love and a rich prince) is set to do it.  I'm also afraid that they will try to \\"tie up\\" the ending and that would be horrible, as well.<br />So I implore Michael Faber: you have a masterpiece here, don't sell it out like Pat Conroy did to Barbara Streisand who then RUINED his masterpiece \\"The Prince of Tides\\"...it can happen...please don't let it happen to you.	2002-10-24

She is one of the most interesting, funny and aggressively irritating characters I've come across in a long long time.

Her descriptions of Ontario, the farming community and especially the special pond, rich with life, are evocative of both Barbara Kinsolver and Margaret Atwood.  This is an extremely satisfying novel about growing up and how the things we think are important change with age and maturity.<br />I'm planning to recommend this novel to my nieces who are 14 and 15.

It's lyrical and witty and a perfect character sketch of 13 year old Broiny as she plans a play in her brother's honor in 1935.  This chapter could stand alone as a short story and you would feel wonderfully satisfied and impressed.<br />But if you move on to the following chapters in &quot;Atonement&quot; confusion, disappointment and frustration set it.  I was so prepared to love this book based on the media hype and the wonderful first chapter...but by the time I got to page 70 and still nothing had happened and the run-on paragraphs were PAGES long full of of internal monologs and descriptions...I finally, reluctantly, sadly, had to close the book.

Quite the contrary; each section, however brief, is finely crafted and perfectly in tune.  The pathos that runs through the story - and we get it in increasing doses as the novel unfolds - is as heartbreaking as the humor is &quot;laugh out loud&quot; funny.

Both are privy to the unfettered ruminations of the opposite sex, but when discovered, the reactions of the two groups couldn't be more different.<br />&quot;Disobedience&quot; is a fully satisfying read.	2000-11-27

Guys turn out to be guys.&quot;<br />This is my favorite line in Frances Prose's new novel &quot;The Blue Angel.&quot;<br />&quot;The Blue Angel&quot; is a fascinating yet horrifying  trip down the proverbial &quot;road to ruin&quot; take by the protagonist,  Creative Writing Professor Ted Swenson.  Finding himself enthused about  student Angela Argo's, writing talent he also become beguiled by her  personally.  Despite her Technicolor hair and numerous facial piercings he  finds himself draw in to her web...and then caught.<br />&quot;The Blue  Angel&quot; it very witty and Prose manipulates the language  beautifully...some of her sentences are so perfect that I found myself  stopping to savor them.  The book provides a brutal and believable look at  a man's downfall but it is also a fair indictment of the women who  continually define themselves and each other as victims, especially in  sexual harassment cases.<br />An excellent novel and I will be checking out  Prose's other works post haste!	2000-05-03

To write a review of Dave Egger's staggering work of heartbreaking genius would be redundant - it's a &quot;self-reviewing&quot; memoir/novel/historical treatise...Eggers anticipates every comment or  criticism that one could make and examines each, every step of the way. His  style is both honest and hilariously self-conscience. I recommend it.	2000-04-26

This collection of slightly interwoven short stories will delight lovers of Irish fiction - particularly of the entertaining and wonderful Maeve Binchy type.  (I'm guessing that she wrote &quot;The Wedding of the  Pughs&quot;!)<br />The last chapter which involves a fading movie star and a  tiger is the perfect comic end to these tales. I will now explore the work  of these other writers!	2000-04-10

She's never steered me wrong so I did - and then spent every spare minute in the next two days  with my nose in it.  Ms. O'Dell writes very convincingly as Harley, the  male 19 year old protagonist of this Greek Tragedy.<br />This book is not  for everyone and I applaud Oprah's courage for choosing it.  The subject  matter is gruesome and disturbing. This is the kind of story that most of  us want to run from. But Ms. O'Dell's narrative is too gripping and to REAL  to turn from. I will be in the front of the line to purchase her next  offering.	2000-04-04
