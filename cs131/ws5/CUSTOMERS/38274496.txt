The dialogues are treatises on various interesting questions, such as what is love, virtue, etc.... The style of the texts are based on the Socratic method of asking questions and use of analogy to test an hypothesis. This gives the texts the style of mysteries as you follow the twists and turns of the arguments to get to the conclusion. Socrates is often the protagonist guiding the reader so it also gives the texts a sense of biography.<br /><br />This collection contains probably the best works, and Rouse's translation is clear and easy to read. Enjoyable, entertaining, mind-opening.	2005-03-02

I have to admit to being a little prejudiced before starting this book. I had read a lot of negative criticism of Freud, so finally I decided to read something for myself and find out what all the fuss is about. A person who creates such polar views must be saying something that touches the core. This slim book is a good place to start.<br /><br />Freud clearly had a deep understanding of the human condition. When you consider he was a born in the 1800s, it is clear he was many years ahead of his time. This book discusses how the individual is inevitably subjugated by his society to become civilized. That is how the social order represses our desires. He discusses both the positive and negative aspects of this on personal development. I found it quite a difficult read as there are extensive footnotes throughout the book that are sometimes pertinent and at other times not, which I found disrupted the chain of reasoning at times.<br /><br />A worthy read that has encouraged me to read more of his work.	2004-11-16

It was interesting to read some of the authors trying integrate this into their model of the mind.<br /><br />The work is somewhat dated (published in 1964) in that none of the latest findings in neurobiochemistry and structural neurology are discussed. I found the chapter on symbolism in the visual arts by Jaffe stretched its arguments a bit too thin for my liking, but was captivated by Jacobi's chapter which describes an analysis.<br /><br />This is a very good primer to Jung and a worthwile read.	2004-11-15

We follow him as he tries to find out who killed the neighbours dog. Our hero has an incredible memory for detail, but is unable to empathize or step back from these details and thus handicaps him in daily living. There were some minor inconsistencies in style to enable the story move forward a bit quicker and I thought that the author wrote himself into a corner (to create some suspense) at one point that he did not get out of too convincingly.<br /><br />If you liked this story I would suggest reading Flowers for Algernon.	2004-07-24

The Darwinist idea was chance changes and permutations of a species' gene pool, that have a bearing on physical traits and behaviours that govern the likelyhood of an individuals survival, results in an evolutionary process. The individual organism is the central object in Dawinist theory. In modern theory the genes themselves are central. That is, organisms are vessels for genes that move forward through time via the organisms they build. This change of perspective helps explain non-selfish acts by individuals, the presence of inactive genes (benign genetic parasites) and why sexual reproduction, which increases gene permutations, predominates amongst the more complex oraganisms. All of which can not be easily explained from the Darwinist viewpoint.<br />The book also explores the statistical nature of survival and extinction and how complexity can be derived from very simple mechanisms, using simple and well thought out examples. At the end of the book, an entertaining exposition of the application of these ideas to the metaphysical world of thought is given.<br />The whole book is written in an engaging and clear style that it is very easy to read.

He is often writing/refering to stuff that is in the books, but you obviously cannot see on a sound track. Given today's technology it would be even better if they produced a CD which contained the written material as well, so you could follow along a bit better.<br />If you ever wondered what the great man sounded like this is your chance.<br />The lectures were recorded live so the acoustics/mic'ing could be better. But electronics were not as good in the 60's.<br />The books themselves are an excellent introduction.	2003-01-23

You are walked through the ideas of special and general relativity, quantum mechanics and string theory without any formalism in a clear and easy to follow way. A truely impressive feat. A glossary of physics terms is also included, though you probably won't need to refer to it to read this book.	2003-01-22

Good diagrams are used in place of the mathematics, with clear explanations and nice analogies to make this subject very accessible and understandable.<br />This will certainly get the mind wheels turning, a very stimulating and fun read.	2003-01-16
