Thoroughly enjoyable and populated with wonderful characters though it takes a little while to move from the mudane story of some denizens of 1950s suburbian to the fun house mirror of what's REALLY going on beneath the surface.  Dick really takes his time tantalizing you with clues that lead to the expected unravelling at the end like a good mystery writer and that really kept me on the hook.  However, once the truth was revealed it felt hurried and a little confusing to me which was a small letdown even though I enjoyed getting there immensely.  Like others here, I am definitely seeing this book's influence on films like The Matrix, The 13th Floor, and (especially) Dark City.	2005-07-15

If your needs are similar, I cannot recommend a book more highly than William Queen's harrowing, white-knuckled account of his adventures infiltrating the Mongols motorcycle gang.  The storytelling is tense and often pretty coarse (maybe even a little sensational) which kept the pages turning for me.  The book is filled with the most unbelievable array of characters that seem crazier than any even Hollywood could dream up and the events unfold at an increasingly breakneck pace. <br /> <br />But aside from all the vicarious thrills to be had by reading about the outlaw ways of Queen and his Mongol brothers, there is a real emotional core to this book that was just as compelling for me.   The conflicting feelings of loyalty the author developed over the course of the investigation made for powerful reading and I couldn't hold back the tears when he spoke of the toll the whole situation took on the well-being of the children of the gang members in addition to his deteriorating relationship with his own young sons.  This is a first-rate nonfiction potboiler with heart.	2005-07-04
US	51193736	R149PTP3HO4QZR	1566565847	779010266	The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions And Distortions	Books	5	72	74	N	N	Explosive, damning	Like many, I was absolutely slack-jawed while reading Griffin's Book \\"The New Pearl Harbor\\".  The claims of conspiracy in the 9-11 attacks were unbelievably controversial yet appeared to be very solidly reasoned and researched, and backed up by numberous sources.  But then the Commission Report came out and, after reading it, that volume seemed so mammoth and exhaustive that Griffin's book seemed light and sketchy by comparison.  While I was still troubled by many suspicious aspects of the attacks, I was much more satisfied with the official explanation that the whole thing was the result of a simultaneous, catastrophic failure of virtually every civilian and military system that was supposed to protect the U.S. from terrorist attacks. <br /> <br />But now Griffin has returned to pull back the curtain to reveal how this supposedly impartial and unbiased commission really conducted their business.  The author lays bare their phony cloak of nonpartisanship, their selective examination of only the evidence that supports their foregone conclusions, and their failure to hold anyone in power accountable for what happened.  Griffin writes chapter after chapter that patiently and methodically picks apart the methods and conclusions of the comission; what they missed, what they ignored, what they distorted.  By the end of the book the 9-11 Commission Report seems like nothing but a shoddy cover-up. <br /> <br />I'd be willing to consider the possibilty that Griffin has got it all wrong but the extent to which you would have to twist and torture the facts and the evidence to explain your way out of the author's incisive conclusions leaves me very persuaded.  David Ray Griffin has been called a conspiracy nut (and worse) but I have yet to see any detailed and/or compelling rebuttal to his extensive research.  And until I do, I remain convinced of a large scale cover-up and I will never again trust my government to truthfully account for a national tragedy.  I invite you to read this book and convince me otherwise.	2005-07-03

For any American who just doesn't get Eurpopean values and general attitudes about civil society this book will be a major revelation.  I already had a lot of info about how far the U.S. is slipping and how the EU is gaining (despite the fact the ratification of their constitution is now in the toilet) but the statistics and anecdotes especially in the first third of this book really crystalized it for me.  The author does a superb job of tracing the historical roots of the divergence of European and American culture and values (though it got too dense for me after a while).   <br /> <br />After reading this book it's clear to me that my country is living a lie about its own greatness (not to be confused with its might) and more than ever I feel like I would feel more at home across The Pond.  And just the fact that I feel just a little nervous and unpatriotic about putting that down in writing speaks volume about the B.S. this once great nation is going through right now.  A bittersweet read overall.	2005-06-03

I originally stayed away from this book because I heard that the author didn't actually put herself in the sink or swim situation of the low-wage workers she was trying to find out about.  Nevertheless, her journey was a fascinating one that will keep me from getting cranky or impatient during my future encounters with these mimimum wagers.   <br /> <br />We (and by that I mean educated, upper-middle class, white collar twits) expect the world of maids, clerks, servers, attendants, etc. but what do they get?  Much of them don't get a living wage, that's for sure.  I worked these kinds of jobs for almost 10 years but I was always up my way because of education and (to a lesser extent) privilege.  The people the author meets in the book are living out their lives in precarious, stressful poverty while at the same time working their asses off.    <br /> <br />This depressing subject is often made wickedly funny because of Ms. Ehrenreich's coarse wit and sharp prose.  And I have her to thank for putting words to my feelings of resistance every time we talk about hiring a \\"cleaning lady\\".  Says Barbara:  \\"I just don't want to have that kind of relationship with another human being\\".  Amen.	2005-06-03

While this book does contain frequent tidbits about the process of filming LOTR, the bulk of it seems taken up by verbose musings on how miserable and unfair it is to be Sean Astin.  There's a ton of backstabbing and whining (albeit very apologetic) that really made for tedious reading.  The author comes across as alternately needy, spoiled, self-absorbed, vain, and often desperate for  constant validation of his own worth as an artist.  (Hey, that describes me a lot of the time, but I don't feel the need to write a BOOK about it.)   <br /> <br />The book does have its merits, however.  It contains an illuminating history of Sean's many dealings with various directors, actors, agents, and other denizens of the shark-infested waters of Hollywood over the course of his career.  There's also a fair amount of interesting information about the business of big studio film production and casting.  Sean seems like an sharp, ambitous guy who's bound for even greater heights, but overall I found this to be a very disappointing read.  If you're looking for a backstage pass to the making of the Tolkien films, hit those DVD bonus features one more time because much of this material belongs in a therapy session, not a published volume.	2005-04-13

Nick is the only member who was in the band from start to finish(?) so I respect his perspective.  He certainly doesn't gloss over the more tempestuous moments in the band's history (i.e. Syd Barrett's departure and the infamous schism in the 80s) but he's extremely diplomatic and even-handed so those looking for the juicy details are bound to be disappointed.  The book is more a celebration of the band and on that level it suceeds marvelously.  Nick is an excellent writer (assuming he wrote it all himself) and a sharp, witty guy.  All that would be enough for me but it must be said the pictures alone are worth the price.  This is a large, luscious volume that I enjoyed a lot.  I only wish Nick hadn't let the other Floyd members add their revisions; this contributes the heavily \\"authorized\\" feel of the book.	2005-04-11

The author's depiction of the experience of being a telepath is fascinating and very often thrilling.  Unfortunately, despite Silverberg's rich, funny, and tragic character study, the story material is pretty light.  The narrative whips back and forth a decade or two to various episodes in the main character's life which results in a very fractured tale that ultimately left me feeling like not much went on in the book.  Once the thrill of Silverberg's vision of mind-reading wore off, I had to push myself to finish it.<br /><br />If finely detailed characters and descriptions of telepathy are enough to keep you busy, you'll probably love this.  If you (like me) crave a more dynamic plot, you might pass on this one.	2005-02-21

You may disagree with his conclusions but critics can't escape the fact of history that all empires fall and they fall hard.  What?  There's no American empire you say?  Just because we have no actual \\"colonies\\"?  Because we use our might to \\"liberate\\" people (especially those who have oil beneath their borders)?   Wake up.  This book taught me that the U.S. has a bigger military that the next 12 biggest militaries COMBINED and we have got bases in every corner of the globe where we stand ready to unilaterally impose our will on any nation that displeases us.  If that doesn't fit your definition of a global empire, I'm dying to know what would. <br /> <br />This book lays bare the extent to which the U.S. government (Republicans AND Democrats) have squandered our tax dollars on a vast global military network that has turned the U.S. into a hated playground bully (OK, maybe we'll help a tsunami victim or two every now and then).  No wonder we are making enemies faster than we can kill them.  What's most disturbing about the book is how pessimistic Johnson is about the prospects for us reversing course.  Let's stop this nonsense and start building a great nation from the inside out.  Read this book to discover just how difficult this task will be.	2005-01-30

This book is long, meandering, and sometimes makes mountains out of molehills.  But Klein really sees the big picture of how the emerging global economy manifests itself in our trips to the mall and elsewhere.  Despite some legitimate criticism this book has gotten, I took from it three core ideas that I challenge anyone to dispute: <br />1. Corporate branding pervades our lives.  It is encroaching on our public institutions and there are less and less places that are free from the noise of advertising and logos.  Also, brand quality now takes a back seat to brand image. <br /> <br />2. Globalism is creating a permanent third-world underclass that makes cheap stuff for shady contractors, hired by large firms who then market to us in the West.  Most large retailers no longer manufacture anything and the companies that do are scattered across the poorest regions of the world, their labor vigilantly hidden from the consumer.  Does a visit to a slaughterhouse make you hungry for a burger?  A visit to a Chinese sweatshop might bum out your next trip to Old Navy. <br /> <br />3. Contract manufacturers absolutely do provide jobs in countries where options are limited but wages are often so low and conditions so brutal (not to mention the institutionalized union-busting), that they would absolutely shock most of us mall rats.  On top of that, corporations generally sell the products at huge markups and reap obscene profits.  That's called exploitation and it's immoral. <br /> <br />Update your thinking about the new global economy.  There's more to it than that $5.99 Finding Nemo T-shirt at Wal-Mart.

But after reading the 9-11 Commission Report, I'm conflicted.  Griffin makes a very compelling case for conspiracy but the sheer exhaustiveness of the Commission Report make this book seem light.  Though I'm no longer totally convinced of a broad conspiracy, there are aspects of 9-11 that stink to high heaven and were never explored by the media or the Commission (the very suspicious nature of the collapse of WTC-7 and the puzzling nature of the damage to the Pentagon, among very many others).   <br /> <br />If you were among those who were outraged at the attacks and pledged to \\"never forget\\" then you owe it to yourself and your country to at least consider the unthinkable by reading this book along with the Commission Report (and I also recommend Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed's \\"The War on Terror\\") and decide for yourself.  If you dimiss every single reasonable conspiracy theorist as a nutcase without considering their arguments, an actual goverment conspiracy might bite you on the butt when you're not looking someday.

I've just always run out of gas after the first 1000 or so pages so it made sense to just start with this one and give it the attention it deserves (especially after seeing the film).  I was suprised at how much I enjoyed the journey of the hobbits back to the Shire to kick some hindquarters as toughened warriors.

It's thick with philosophy and politics but these rarely overwhelm the gripping narrative and impressive characters.  I've been around the spinoffs and derivations of this story all my life, so I thought the original might seem tame, but what was most compelling about the novel for me was just how terrifying and vivid Orwell's world is.  I mean, I could TASTE it.  Grim and relentless, yet thrilling and emotional.

The author does draw many conclusions of his own, but mostly he simply corrals the best investigative reporting (much of it from major media sources), public testimony, and government documents into a coherent picture of why things went down as they did.  The historical and political backstory provided is crucial to dispelling the apalling myth that we were attacked out of the blue and nothing could be done about it.  The tone is incredulous and even-handed rather partisan or ideological.  The facts presented in this book rocked me to my very core and left me mad as hell.

Unfortunately, the rest of it gets lost in the minutae of the investigation in Germany, background of terrorist groups, and personal details of the lives of survivors.  Nicely done, but not totally what I was after.	2004-11-12

Despite my embrace of various 9-11 conspriracy theories, I found this volume to be a pretty throrough and plausible account of the events that lead up to and followed the tragedy.  Also, the report is pretty hard-hitting and unflinching in its examination of U.S. policies and the systems that are supposed to detect and deal with threats.  The commissioners make some important recommendations that are probably too radical for the powers that be to embrace with any enthusiasm so I doubt much will change.  This ain't no Warren Commission report but I still feel like there are several aspects of 9-11 (especially regarding planes and buildings) that the commission ducked.  Still, I learned a lot.	2004-10-16

Another fine work from my favorite guy that's got great action, pacing and, above all, characterizations.  The people in this story were very real to me and the society in which they live seemed very plausible.  The meandering and intersection of the characters' fates is set against an impending climax that we know is coming from the beginning of the story and when it arrives, it's thrilling and very moving.  I loved this one.	2004-10-16

Dick	Books	2	12	17	N	N	Fanciful	The latest manifestation of my obsession with PKD ends in disappointment.  The author seems to care more about pretentious writing and fanciful extrapolations of events in his subject's life, rather than responsibly unravelling the man and his madness.  To be sure, there's some fairly solid biographical info in places, but the amount of ponderous crap I had to wade through to get to it left me very unsatisfied.	2004-10-16
