Yet, as she describes each phase, he thinks about what he is, and doubts he could be much more. This is a parable about love, faith and beauty. We were surprised by our toddler's reaction. We didn't think she'd have patience for the story (more words than your average book for 2 to 4 year old), but s/he did. It is a soothing, warm story that we liked reading as much as s/he did. The pastoral illustrations complement the story beautifully. The narrative describes a plant's cycle (from seed to flower) in terms simple enough for a young reader to understand. The book is as billed: a book for all ages. On the surface this is the story of how a flower grows. Scratch a little deeper, and there are lessons about doubt, faith, love, patience and beauty.	2005-06-22

She has only a few friends at her new school, most of her friends from before seem to have abandoned her. She is also trying to figure out more about a boy she likes. This is a young adult novel focusing on the things that are important to and affect teenagers. It is a great book that young readers can relate to. It mentions many of the things young teens are facing today. I suggest it for readers in 8th and 9th grades.	2005-06-22

This book, published by Catholic Publishing, emphasizes the victory of Patrick over the Irish Druids and other enemies of the Church. This book is drier than some of the other books this parent found, but the illustrations are vivid and the stories are good teaching tools. This is a good book for showing that perseverance, courage, and most of all, faith, will overcome all. This book is better for school-aged children due to the realism and the themes of victory over evil. It allows you to explain Catholic beliefs about St. Patrick and his important work in Ireland despite many enemies and difficulties.	2005-06-22

It shows--pictorially, using two different styles--how a youngster can put the concepts they represent immediately to work. The book goes well beyond the \\"save your pennies\\" philosophy I was raised on. The book introduces terms that some kids never hear until they take their first economics class. I liked the presentation style  that looks vaguely like a Tim Allen movie--artistic washes, subtle tones. Kids will love the brightly colored segments. More importantly--for the parents at least--they are sure to absorb some sound ideas about ensuring their own futures. The purpose of the book is clear: the sooner you learn to manage your money, the more you'll have to enjoy.	2005-06-22

If you remember Opus and Bloom County and the basselope, Rosebud, this is for you.  It will takes you back twenty years. Breathed does a fantastic job with the artwork, and the story is exquisite, too. On it's surface it is just a fun book to read together and laugh out loud.

This is a pastoral book that celebrates and educates children about the Ta&iacute;no history and culture. The illustrations are incredibly beautiful. It is difficult to tell, at times, whether this is to be a rhyming verse or descriptive poem. When reading aloud, sometimes the rhyming and/or alliterations works, at other times, though it is difficult reading. The intricate, colorful illustrations will brighten any day, even if you don't read the text. The story introduces readers to Puerto Rico in a way that they are not likely to find elsewhere. The parallels with Native American culture (i.e., Nature's role in our survival) also lend great opportunities to talk about conservation and caring for our world.	2005-06-21

Think Twilight Zone for mid-elementary school kids. The stories are such that they offer suspense and fantasy, without creating fear. Don't try this book with kids under five. The stories aren't too spooky, but the younger kids just won't get it, Some stories ended a little flat--just ended, without a proper catharsis or climax. The first thing to know is, these did NOT cause nightmares in a six-year-old boy. The stories are short, suitable for bedtime reading, and the \\"horror\\" of the stories is drawn from suspense and odd twists (boy turning into a snail, boy wishes for twin brother and gets an evil twin one day). They do NOT rely on blood and gore. There are no educational elements to speak of. Indirectly, the stories may spur your child's imagination in new directions.	2005-06-21

This is a thrilling adventure that takes you away with it. It is for younger teenagers.  Each character has a special vibe and its own personality. Just reading one makes you want to read the whole series. The reader gets drawn into the story and goes along for the ride. The book is well written and the plot is exciting.

They are the Fortune Tellers Club. Gena find a pair of cat-eye sunglasses in a thrift store and believes they can predict the future!  Gina's friends laugh at her, but not for long. This is a well-written book, full of suspense.  I wanted to keep reading and never put it down. It was a funny book at times, and serious at others. The story line was a little bit young. I would recommend this book to most kids who are ages seven to ten. The story moves quickly, and the characters have enough depth for teens to say \\"that's me,\\" or \\"that's just like so-and-so.\\" The interplay among the girls is excellent. One of the characters is dealing with a dad who wants to date again. Something today's kids can relate to. The author projects excellent imagery and its wholesome, fun reading. Kids at every age can use a reminder about the importance (and rules) of friendship. For those squeemish about mystical arts, it's an opportunity to talk with your kids and keep the 'evil' in perspective.	2005-06-21

It is equally appropriate for adults who work with children living without their parents. Alcoholism, shelter living, and feelings of displacement are handled with great aptitude.

Thanks to a special gift from her grandmother, she has the power to be totally absorbed in the stories she loves. This story is part teen journal and part mystery. Windy's life is front and center in this book. The occasional references to how she misses her mother, grandmother, and father offer key perspectives about how Windy sees the world. The story moves smoothly and it is easy to keep up with the plot. Teens will relate to Windy. However, Windy's life happens largely in isolation, the other characters are largely absent: her father is traveling, her mother  is dead, and a step-mother that just pops in/out. This may not be an environment you want to condone or encourage for your teen. The subtle, underlying message in this book is that a love of reading sparks your imagination...and you can transport yourself into a story.	2005-06-21

This is an amusing linguistic travel adventure written in diary format. Because the author phonetically spells the Spanish words Melanie learns, I found myself saying some of the words aloud and learning quite a few things along the way. An appendix of all the foreign words Ms. Weston used would have been an added benefit to the book. With Love From Spain, Melanie Martin will make you want to take your kids on a European adventure of your own, no matter where you live in the world!

I read the book in one sitting and went to bed later than I should have! This is an enjoyable read that I'll probably pick up again. The story moves quickly, and the writing is clear, albeit awkward at times. The imagery and mystery blend well, making it a story where you can follow along with Josie and Lucy. It might have been nice to have a map of Whitner for visual readers. Some may find the plot troubling, as Josie and her brother entice the two-time murderer back into Whitner by themselves. The story debunks traditional myths/stereotypes of ghosts, and looking past it, there are opportunities to talk about compassion, empathy, and taking responsibility for one's actions.	2005-06-21

This is a series book for middle readers. The writing level is not as sophisticated (read: challenging and smooth) as I've seen in other books for this target audience. Let's hope  the target reader is more savvy than what the plot offers and doesn't buy into some of the mean-spirited activities the girls are engaged in. The story perpetuates some of what is wrong in how we treat each other. Reiterating poor behavior and bad choices for teens who are absorbing what they read is never good. The story isn't written well enough for them to draw out (what we expect) is a positive life lesson. If you can read this with your pre-teen, there's an opportunity to talk about how people treat each other; how it feels/what it would feel like to be the odd person out; how it feels when someone plays tricks on them.	2005-06-21

We were quite disappointed that the tape brought to life the teasing (which we were able to play down in the readings). <br /> <br />	2005-06-20

Gang the responsibility of finding a place for Jesus to be born. Their search takes them from the Roman Empire to Bethlehem and from castles to a stable. This is the story of Christ's birth from the Angel's perspective. The story is packed with valuable information for setting both the historical and religious contexts of Christmas. The young angels are today's kids in white garb and with backpacks. The book may be trying to do TOO much. While the search for a suitable birthplace for the King of Kings makes for a viable, effective plot technique, the story (despite all the words) doesn't reconcile the modern-ish angels with an historical event very well.	2005-06-20

To his surprise, he discovers that he has worth in his \\"later days,\\" too. This is an allegory about living life to its fullest ... and accepting the surprises along the way. This is a fun read, but will be particularly great come fall, when it will be easy to bring the book to life. It is a nice reminder that we are only limited by the perceptions we create for ourselves. The book offers several layers of learning, depending on the child's age: what happens in the fall, how life changes, and self-esteem. It wouldn't take much to draw lessons about aging parents/grandparents from the story, too.	2005-06-20

The style of writing is very similar to the Rugrats, a show on which both writers have worked. It has a very Nickelodeon-esque pace with flying donuts and evil characters in the form of teenage babysitters who try to dominate the smaller kids. It is one way to lure the TV generation away from the tube and into a book with similar characters whose lives are as magical as the imagination of an 8-year-old child. There is a moral to the story, and sometimes the best way to \\"get it\\" is with humor and a push of the imagination.	2005-06-20

Toss in an earthquake and  Pirate Treasure Day and you've got a humdinger of a day! Six teens determined to win the prize on Pirate Treasure Day find more than they imagined when the take a shortcut at the 3 Doors Bookstore. This is a fantasy adventure book for teens. The story has wonderful twists and turns, so it is hard to predict what will happen next. Although primarily a fantasy, there are learning opportunities to be found in the discussion about 19th century, archaelogy (and lost civilizations), and the value of teamwork.	2005-06-20

Each story is a testament to perseverence and self-determination. Whatever a child's dream (science, education, sports, invention, performing arts), there is a hero AND heroine who made their dream come true. The collection ran the gamut of great achievers. Some I knew about, others were new. The stories were too short for my taste. Although balanced in numbers, some of the selections puzzle me. For example, why Sammy Sosa and not Roberto Clemente? The stories have enough information to potentially inspire a child to research and learn more about a person of interest. Great balance of men and women for all fields of achievement.<br /><br />The mini-biographies were choppy at times. The collection may be too heavy with sports figures (24% are athletes, all but one male), including Michael Jordan, who left school early to go pro? The biographies celebrate personal triumphs, despite others' judgments and roadblocks. A great book for talking about being true to one's self!	2005-06-20

He was chosen in a prophecy, and with his two best friends and a falcon, must save his village. Together, they face many obstacles in their path to achieve their goal. The book offers opportunities for discussing community, family, and one's purpose in life. The book has a pretty good plot, but the story could have been presented better. It is a good story for people in the second or third grades.	2005-06-20

With their parents traveling in Europe, fifth-graders Ginger Wanamaker and Irene Fong spend a month with Ginger's grandparents. In their search for interesting things to do, they discover that the house was part of the Underground Railroad. The story not only sets out historical events, but is designed to generate kids' interest in doing more research, too. This well-edited book is a wonderful read, full of adventure with an educational twist to which many young readers can relate. After just a few pages, the reader notices the educational value of Curiosity. While the questions at the base of each chapter may be somewhat intrusive for the average adult reader, the book is ideal for readers age 9-12. This is a fast read, with a great story built around historical events, places and things.  Everyone in the house--not just the target audience--will enjoy the book and want to learn more.	2005-06-20

Our preschooler loved following the frog from page to page. Even now that she knows the answer, we've still been asked to read it for several nights in succession. The illustrations are captivating, making the story a fun read. Even with all the visual clues, we didn't figure it out the first time. Buy! There will be days where you will just want to stare at the pictures. They are that neat. There are many learning opportunities here: every frog is a prince (we are all beautiful); patience; opposites, clich&eacute;, and creative thinking. Last but not least, Riddles make great gateways to opening one's imagination and pushing the brain in new directions.	2005-06-14

His worst fears come true when the school bully says he's not allowed to play with them. When Boomer gets the chance to show his special qualities, others stop and take notice. This is a story that reminds kids (and their parent readers) about the pitfall of judging others. Our preschoolerloved it right away, especially Boomer's lavender coloring. We were asked to read this one several times in a row, for several days running. This is a sweet story. Predictable, but cute. The author creates a great way for parents to talk with their kids about their fears, which likely mirror Boomer's: first day of/new school, being made fun of, feeling left out.	2005-04-28

As we closed the book on the first reading, our preschooler announced 'Read it again, Mama.' We've since read it a number of times, each one a little slower, as s/he begins to study the illustrations in more detail. The story is really just a sequence of sentences counting out how many bees and what they do. It's the beautiful illustrations and the fun of sharing a read-out-loud book that make this great. The bees are cute and the pages are sturdy and will withstand frequent readings, too. Definitely buy this book if you want an art-quality counting book for your child's library.	2005-04-19

Books	5	0	0	N	N	As Soothing as Rocking Your Baby	This is a poem that explains how parents view their children: babies take a place in your heart, and no matter their size or their age, that loving spot remains. This book exudes love, and can be enjoyed by everyone in the family. Although not billed as a book for adoptive families, it may assuage the 'fears' of adopted children. Our preschooler immediately wanted a second reading ... and then asked us to stop reading and started reciting the poem herself. It is a wonderful poem that will make young kids feel warm and also allow parents to remind pre-teens and teenagers why they remain so protective, but without being a nudge or going over the top (i.e, too sappy).This is a book that is shared with a hug. There is no story, per se, only the warmth of sharing your love with a child. For adoptive families, it helps affirm a child's place in your heart.	2005-04-14

We've had nightly requests for this book for more than a week now. What a great book! The message is visible in simple phrases with comparative language that young readers can comprehend. It offers kids a positive, new way to look at the world. Parents will enjoy the book as much for its fun as for its message. The illustrations are bright and engaging; and the poem is just what you want to introduce acceptance and the beauty of diversity ... without being onerous or dour.	2005-04-14

When Jessie doesn't mail her mother's letter asking the Lighthouse Service for assistance, she creates a dangerous situation for her family and the ships that rely on the light.

Even without having lived at a lighthouse, you get a sense of what life was like. It is easy to empathize with both Jessie and her Mother. This is a book everyone can enjoy. If you live near or love lighthouses, you'll want this in your collection.	2005-04-14

As the sun sets, Peeper heads out to visit wit his other nocturnal friends in the rainforest. Tonight he wants to find something different to do. After two readings, this book was part of our preschooler's daily 'must-haves' at nap time, and often in the evening. Months later, we still get requests to read it. The story moves fast and is packed with lots of tidbits about the animals' behaviors. It's initial attractiveness was likely due in part to Zaboomafu, which is wildly popular in our house, but we are still sharing this one, nearly a year later!	2005-03-13

Music, more than anything else, helps her deal with the scars of her childhood. In her effort to land a spot as a regular on a local teen dance show, she gets more than she bargained for. This is a mystery adventure for young adults that is fun and moves along well. The plot moves quickly, with the right balance of character development and action. It's great to have a mystery with good clean fun. Although principally just a fictional novel, teens trying to come to grips with 'family secrets' or dealing with life-altering trauma may find a kindred spirit in Mattie. It's a nice follow-on to Secrets and Kisses. If you haven't read Secrets & Kisses yet, buy both. Even if you aren't a teen anymore, you'll like this book.	2005-03-04
