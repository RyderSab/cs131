Even secularized Jews, starting with Moses Mendelssohn and others, transfer this belief into an attempt to create a worldly utopia in the here and now while abandoning traditional Jewish observance. This explains why various universalist, utopian philosophies, such as Marxism, attracts secular Jews. Similarly, attempts to create an improved \\"Reform\\" Judaism, or a quasi-universalist Socialist Zionism attracted Jews who had abandoned belief in the Jewish religious tradition. Amos Elon, a Jew of this type, in this outstanding book, looks back at what seemed at the time, the most successful attempt of the Jews to shed their supposedly \\"parochial\\" traditions and to assimilate into what looked like a vital culture, Germany of the 19th and early 20th century which had such a flowering of music, literature, art, science and industry in which Jews played such a major role. Although most Jews abandoned religious tradition in the period, moving upward in the social and economic mileu of Germany, and felt that they were as German as any non-Jewish German, especially after having fought as good patriots in the wars of the 1870 and 1914-1918, the whole edifice of German Jewish assimilation came crashing down, dragging much of Europe into the abyss with it. Many Jews came into prominence in the highest levels of German society and politics, even into the Kaiser's entourage, and yet, when the crunch came with the defeat in 1918, the Kaiser and others blamed \\"the Jews\\" for the defeat, even though the Jews were the most loyal of all Germans. As Elon points out, many in Europe admired or feared the Germans, only the Jews loved them. And this love was totally unrequited, as the Germans, as a people, decided that the Jews were responsible for all their problems and that the Jews would have to be annihilated, even if it meant the destruction of their own country in the process.  <br />Elon describes well the adoption of the \\"kulturreligion\\", the religion of culture that the German Jews adopted with their almost fanatical devotion to music, literature, art and philosophy, and their blind, fanatical patriotism that burst out in 1914 when even many who would later claim to be pacifists such as Martin Buber expressed bloodthirsty enthusiasm for war and German aggression. However, I don't agree with Elon's assertion at the end of the book that Hitler and the Holocaust \\"weren't inevitable\\" since he claims that Hitler came to power only through a shabby political deal and not through \\"irresistable historical forces\\".  All the accounts I read of the period by Germans who were around at the time said most people, especially the young, felt that Germany's future was \\"either Red or Brown\\" (i.e. Communist or Nazi) and that democracy was discredited. <br />What is especially interesting is how Elon is expressing his own longing for such a secular messianic era. Once an ardent Zionist, who thought a similar Israeli society based on a similar \\"kulturreligion\\" would develop in Israel and people like him would be revered as national \\"philosophers\\", he, to his horror, saw the revival of traditional Jewish religious observance, bringing him to the decision earlier this year to leave Israel for good. As he stated in a newspaper interview, he used to be able to call the Prime Minister of Israel to arrange a personal meeting, but today, the political elite has no interest in him, so he sees no reason to remain in Israel.  <br />At the end of the book, he express the despair of the good German Jews who loved their country so much. Instead of pointing out how tens of thousands of German Jews made \\"aliyah\\" (immigrated) to Israel and enriched the emerging society there, in spite of the inevitable hardships, he instead focuses on all the Jews who committed suicide, unable to live outside their beloved Fatherland which had foresaken them. Elon is giving expression to his own despair that the Jewish state is returning to its own Jewish roots and his alienation from them.  <br />This book is a must for those who want to understand the tragic culmination of Jewish life in Germany and Europe as a whole, and the odyssey of the alienated Jew who simply wants to abandon his own people and tradition, something that the Germans and Europe proved is impossible.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-14

As a young man, he assiduously <br />read the works of Leon Trotsky, as he says in his memoirs.  Trotksy's distorted Marxist view of reality has stayed with Peres his entire career.  Trotsky was only interested in \\"world revolution\\", making everybody the same, and Trotsky would define what the \\"same\\" would be and use force to impose it. Thus Peres reveres the song of John Lennon \\"Imagine\\" in which talks about a world without nations or religions, and I presume Peres and Lennon would then force all of us to believe in what they believe in also, even if we don't want to.  Peres retains the Marxist philosophy that man's primary motivation is economics  which leads him to make his silly statement in his book \\"The New Middle East\\"-\\"in the modern world all people care about is money and internet\\"-although we see that the Muslim extremists and their supporters don't seem to think the way Peres does.  In any event, there is no place for the Jews or Zionism in his scheme of things.  When Peres and Rabin made their Nobel Prize speeches, they made them in English, although the custom for everyone else who shows pride in their country and culture is to make it in their native language, as did their \\"friend and partner\\" Arafat.  Obviously Judaism, the Hebrew language and Zionism are embarrassments to him.  Fortunately, the people of Israel have had their say by reducing the number of seats the party he has had a stranglehold over for almost the last 30 years from 44 down to 19.    Thus, the reader interested  in seeing the way Israel is going in the future had better look elsewhere than this cliche-filled, \\"politically correct\\" book.	2005-06-02

This must be kept in mind when reading this book.  While they clearly show the reckless policies Sharon carried out, much of their ire towards him is political.  For example, while they decry Sharon's alliance with the Gemayal's Falangist Party, correctly pointing out its Fascist tendencies and pontificate about Sharon sullying's Israel's reputation by making an alliance with what is essentially a corrupt, mafia-like organization, suddenly,  10 years later, when Peres and Rabin (whose Labor Party they support) made the Oslo <br />agreements with the even more murderous and corrupt Arafat and the so-called \\"Palestine Liberation Organization\\", Shiff and Ya'ari were praising the \\"pragmatism\\" of Peres and Rabin saying \\"you can't choose your peace partners\\".  Thus, we see that their primary agenda is political and not \\"truth seeking\\". (Incidentally when Arafat started his war with Israel in September 2000 Ya'ari went on television and said \\"I always knew the Oslo agreeements were a mistake\\").  Similarly, they (correctly) denounce Sharon's underhanded activities during the war, keeping the government in the dark about his activities, but then in 2004 when Sharon used undemocratic, dishonest procedures to betray his promises about not destroying the Jewish communities in the Gaza district, they suddenly claim he is a great, far-sighted leader.

US	52274159	RFDMBNYLL0LVP	0520207661	608877018	The Rabin Memoirs, Expanded Edition with Recent Speeches, New Photographs, and an Afterword	Books	2	6	10	N	N	Flawed Autobiography about A  Flawed Man	Yitzhak Rabin is a truly tragic figure in the history of the Jewish people.  Here was a man, while having many good qualities had deep, even fatal character flaws that allowed him both to play a major role in bringing about Israel's great victory in the Six-Day War of June 1967 and yet, at the same time, bringing about his own destruction while leaving his country in a perilous  state as a result of his disastrous Oslo agreement of 1993.  Unfortunately, like almost all the autobiographies of Israel's famous leaders, this book is self serving and does not really give one a good idea of what really happened.  For example, Rabin completely skips over Israel's War of Independence in 1948 when he had the important position of commander of the Har'el Brigade which played an important role in the battles for Jerusalem.  The reason is that he showed for the first time during the war his inability to function under pressure and it is believed that he fled the battlefield at a critical juncture, but it was decided to hush up the matter. Rabin was a member of the \\"Dor HaPalmach\\", i.e. the generation of the Palmach (pre-state elite military force). These people fought hard and contributed much but this gave them a feeling of priviledge which led them in later years to behave arrogantly and for those who entered politics to show contempt for Israel's democratic system-Ariel Sharon's dictatorial behavior being the latest example (although Sharon was not in the Palmach, but he did joint the military elite in the 1950's).  Rabin played a major role in preparing the Israeli Army for its lightening victory in 1967, but once again, he suffered a nervous collapse before the war, and did not (as I understand it) play an important role in its execution.  Rabin, who was thrust basically unqualified into the Prime Minister's office in 1974, mainly for the reason that he was out of Israel during the Yom Kippur war, was unprepared for the job. He was the first of a long line of military mento become Prime Minister, and he showed all the flaws of this group, arrogance, contempt for democracy, and corruption. These men have led Israel into a dead-end situation, because many people blindly think that \\"generals are good leaders\\" whereas the reality is that they are the worst leaders, since their whole career they give orders and have no patience with the give and take of politics.  Rabin, in the book spews out harsh criticism of his long-term  rival Shimon Peres, but in his second term (1992-1995) which is not covered in his book, he allowed this dangerous man to lead him around by the nose, forcing the Oslo Agreements on him against his better judgement, again due to his weak personality.  All of this ended in the tragedy of his assassination as the SHABAK (Israeli internal security agency) which was supposed to be under Rabin's personal supervision, went on a rampage using provacoteurs to discredit the Labor Party's rivals, locating a potential assassin and then giving him free access to Rabin at the fateful gathering on November 4, 1995. (For those of you who are skeptical, please note the official Shamgar Commission inquiry into the assassination noted that the assassin's closest companion in the months before the murder was a SHABAK provacoteur). A very tragic ending for a complex, talented, but flawed man.	2005-05-30

Sharon is widely believed to be Israel's greatest battlefield commander.  He created the fighting spirit Israel was famous for in the 1950's and 60's by his formation of the well-known Unit 101.  Instead of retiring to a well-deserved rest and chance to provide for his family, his arrogance led him to enter Israeli politics.  From here, his character flaws of dishonesty and lack of values began to take their toll on Israeli public life.  First, he became one of the founders of the right-wing Likud party in 1973, but by the time the 1977 elections came around, he had left it and founded a left-wing party committed to an independent Palestinian state, which was rejected at that time by the Leftist Labor Party.  Since Menachem Begin won the election instead of the incumbent Labor Party, he veered to the Right again and joined the cabinet, becoming champion of the settlement movemend in the Judea/Samaria/Gaza territories taken in the 1967 war.  However, Begin decided to give away the Sinai, so Sharon was put in charge of destroying the Jewish communities there, so he was appointed Defense Minister and carried this out.  Right after this, he launched Israel on its Lebanese mis-adventure.  Forced out of office as a result of it, he lowered his profile and built an alliance with Labor leaders Shimon Peres who ostensibly was on the other side of the fence politically, but that did not prevent these two from collaborating quietly.  When the opportunity for Sharon came to become Prime Minister, he suddenly announced that the destruction of the Jewish communities in the Sinai was \\"a mistake\\".  This helps propel him to the Prime Minister's Office in 2001 by lining up support of the Right.  The Terror War of the Palestinians which started in autumn 2000 discredited the Labor Party and its Prime Minister Ehud Barak.  Sharon was elected to put an end to it, but instead, he forms a cabinet with his friend Peres and then announces that the terror really can't be stopped.  Finally, with the Pesach Night massacre in the Park Hotel in Netanya in 2002, Sharon was forced to act.  Finally, military pressure is applied and slowly the terror war is subdued.  Sharon announces during his 2003 re-election campaign that it is unthinkable to destroy the Jewish communities in the Gaza Strip as his opponent Mitzna suggests, but after being re-elected overwhelmingly on that platform, suddenly turns around, makes an alliance with the Far Left and adopts an even more radical form of Mitzna's plan.  Of course, the Left now loves Sharon since he betrayed his voters (including this reviewer who volunteered to work for his campaign), but this unbelievably cynical man is a danger to the entire Zionist enterprise.  Although the book is interesting, his habitual deceitfulness makes me wonder about the veracity of many things stated in the book.    This book shows that he has made a great contribution to building Israel, particularly in his early days, but I hope Israelis will wake up and look for integrity in their leaders, and not just a military uniform.	2005-02-22

Most reviewers have either put 1 star or 5 stars which indicates, to me, a partisan attitude towards the book.  I put 3 stars to indicate that the book is interesting, does raise important points, but must be kept in proportion. <br />I live in Israel, am a member of the \\"National Religious\\" camp and consider myself a follower of former Chief Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak haKohen Kook's philosophy.  Thus, for me the unity and internal peace of the Jewish people are paramount.  If Berger is correct, the belief of some Habadniks that the Rebbe is the Mashiach and will come back to life in that role is \\"doctrinally incorrect\\" in normative (i.e. Orthodox) Judaism.  The question that must be asked now is how to deal with those who hold these \\"incorrect\\" beliefs.  Berger feels that the mainstream Jewish world is indifferent to the problem and thus a great danger is lurking out there and is not being confronted.  I strongly believe that Berger is overstating the case.  Doctrinal differences in the traditional Jewish community are nothing new.  RAMBAM (Maimonides) wrote a classic halacha (Jewish law) book that did not include the sources he used. He also wrote the extremely controversial \\"Guide to the Perplexed\\".  Many were outraged by these books and some were even burned.  However, today, all groups accept the RAMBAM, even if they still disagree with his philosophical views.  There is a raging debate in the religious world today over the age of the earth and universe, some claiming it is a matter of faith to believe they are 5765 years old, others, learned a pious, have no problem saying they are billions of years old.  Some hold that the cosmology of the RAMBAM (based on Ptolemy) having the sun and planets go around the earth, is an integral part of the Torah given at Sinai, others say it is outdated and there is no problem with the Copernican view of the Solar System where the earth moves around the sun.  The attitudes of the Hasidim and their Mitnaged opponents towards prayer,Torah study and other crucial matters differ widely, but today both accept each other as authentic religious Jews.  Thus, people learned to live with differences that were once quite heated and sometimes lead to excommunications and even violence.  Berger claims that the the essence of difference between Christianity and Judaism is the latter's rejection of someone rising from the dead and being Mashiach.  This is a very gross oversimplification.  Judaism can stand on its own and I don't see people becoming \\"confused\\" and going between Chabad and the other belief.  Other false messianic movements like that of Shabtai Zvi and the Frankists led their followers away from mainstream Jewish observance and that is certainly not the case with Habad. <br />Here in Israel in the late 1980's and early 1990's there was a major controversy over the role of Habad and it led to many unfortunate and ugly incidents.  Fortunately, this has more or less disappeared.  If we were to follow Berger's advice, we would have to start an inquisition of each and every Habadnik's beliefs in order to decide whether he can remain an member of the Jewish society. NO ONE WANTS WITCHHUNTS OR A CIVIL WAR.  Israel is now involved in a terrible war with Arab/Islamist terrorism, Jewry faces an onslaught of world-wide Judeophobia, and anti-relgious forces within Israel and the Jewish world are attacking the religious community in order to weaken it.  These are the real challenges facing the Jewish people, and Habad plays an important (if not vital) role in its defense.  Berger is right in pointing out that there are negative phenomena that can come out of doctrinal errors, but his warning MUST be kept in proportion and not be the cause of even more damage to the Jewish people in this time of peril. History has proven that groups that really broke with the mainstream traditional Jewish community over basic beliefs like the early Judeo-Christians, the Tzadukim (Sadducees), the Karaim (Karaites), Shabbateans, Frankists, and others have ultimately disappeared, so we can be confident that if a serious doctrinal error is really endangering Jewish belief, it will eventually extinguish itself in any event.	2005-02-06

He is the one who most understands the spiritual crisis of the modern Jew.  The book \\"Orot\\" (Lights) is one of his most important works.  Here he explains his views on the role of \\"Am Israel\\" (the Jewish people) in bringing G-d's message to the world.  He explains the importance of the return of the Jewish people to its historical, Biblically-mandated homeland in Eretz Israel (The Land of Israel).  Unlike some other religious Zionist thinkers who generally look at Zionism's role as simply facilitating the \\"ingathering of the exiles\\", Rav Kook shows in this book that the inherent holiness of the land mandates that the Jewish people settle and develop as much of it as possible, and not simply satisfy themselves with a small community residing on a small fraction of its divinely-mandated boundaries.  A strong Jewish life, in all its manifestations, spiritual, economic, military, scientific in the whole Land of Israel will benefit not just the Jewish people, but its Arab neighbors and all of mankind as well. <br />Rav Kook's writings are generally difficult for the novice reader, even someone who is fluent in Hebrew.  Rav Samson's translation into English and his cogent explanations of the text makes part of this classic text available to the wider Jewish world, just when it needs it the most, as the Jewish world confronts doubts among parts of the Jewish people (both religious and non-religious) over the Jewish people's very rights to Eretz Israel in addition to a violent onslaught by non-Jews against the Jewish nation.  I also recommend  Rav Samson's continuation of the translation of \\"Orot\\" called \\"War and Peace\\" where he deals with vast historical trends and wars that impact the Jewish people and its redemption.	2005-02-06

The Warren Commission drew a picture of a \\"frustrated loser\\", who probably due to feelings of jealousy and inadequacy, decided to kill the \\"young, handsome, rich, popular President\\".  This seemed unsatisfactory to many people, providing a fertile ground for the spawning of the myriads of conspiracy theories that have flourished since then. <br /> <br />Fortunately, the fall of the Communist regime in the Soviet Union, which occurred while many of the people who knew Oswald during his sojourn there were still alive, shed much new light on Oswald.  Norman Mailer took advantage of this to get much new information on Oswald's stay there which played a crucial in the development of his distorted personality.  This work, in addition to new interviews conducted by Mailer with people in the US who had contact with him led Mailer, who originally believed that JFK's murder was probably part of a conspiracy, finally to come to the conclusion that Oswald was not just some ultimately unexplicable \\"nut\\" or \\"patsy\\", but that Oswald viewed himself as an international revolutionary, a potentially major figure in history (which he did indeed become for the wrong reasons), similar to the \\"international terrorists\\" plaguing the world today. Oswald had much in common with the murderers who perpetrated the atrocities of 9/11, i.e. <br />rage against humanity, ideological fanaticism (whether \\"religious\\" or \\"secular\\"), sexual frustration, etc.  This helps to clear up the problem that was raised after the assassination in which people who knew Oswald said he \\"liked\\" the President.  Terrorists do not kill people because they \\"dislike\\" them, but rather view murder as a \\"revolutionary act\\" directed to achieving a higher goal. <br />One important facet of the book is that Mailer quotes extensively from interviews of witnesses conductedy by the Warren Commission.  Mailer points out that the memories of the witnesses were freshest at the time, and that memory tends to get fogged or distorted with the passage of time, particularly in this case where they are constantly being bombarded over the years by critical interviewers with an agenda. <br />This book is a major contribution to the historical record, and I am saying this as someone who is no particular fan of Mailer and his world view (as great a writer as he may be).  I give him credit for being intellectually honest enough to change his views, although it should be pointed out that he doesn't reject the possibilty of a conspiracy (particularly in the case of Jack Ruby although he does admit that Ruby could not have started out that Sunday morning intending to kill Oswald), but he admits that there is no real evidence of one. <br />One significant weakness of the book is its lack of an index, but it is still a \\"must\\" book for those who want to understand this historical tragedy.	2004-11-22
US	52274159	R3OHCAUSVXJCS9	0029334357	641946596	Lenin: A New Biography	Books	4	40	48	N	Y	The Most Evil Man Bertrand Russell Ever Met	For years after Nikita Khruschev's famous \\"secret speech\\" in 1956 denouncing Stalin and some of his crimes, apologists for the USSR and its Communist system continued to claim that if only Lenin had lived longer, Soviet-style Communism would have evolved in a much more benign direction than it ultimately did under the bloodthirsty Stalin.  This book, written by a formerly high-ranking member of the Soviet military establishment who himself believed this, tears this myth to shreds. By getting unprecendented access to secret Soviet archives, Volkogonov clearly shows that the criminal nature of the regime was instituted by Lenin and his associates from the first day they came to power.  There never was an \\"idealistic\\", clean phase to the Bolshevik Revolution.  The corruption and tyranny began at once. Although the author points out that Bolsehvism appeals to universal ideas of social justice, when Lenin called to turn the \\"imperialist war\\" (i.e. the First World War) into a \\"civil war\\", the writing was on the wall for anyone who wanted to see it that it was the Bolshevik's intention to tear Russian society apart, and not just provide the people \\"peace, land and bread\\" as Lenin also claimed in order to get the naive to support his agenda for revolution.<br /><br />Lenin never had any intention to improve the lives of the Russian people because at a time of mass famine during the \\"War Communism\\" repression at the time of the Civil War after the October Revolution, the Bolshevik regime was sending millions of dollars out of the country in order to stir up revolutions in other countries while letting their own people starve.  Lenin was only interested in political power leading to what he hoped would be \\"world revolution\\" and class struggle.  All morality was subordinated to the goal of attaining and keeping power, and any deceit and violence was justifiable for these purposes.<br /><br />I think it can be stated that Communism was the greatest fraud in history because millions of otherwise well-meaning people were conned by Lenin and his successors into supporting this gigantic criminal enterprise.<br /><br />It should be pointed out that this book is not really a comprehensive biography of Lenin, but is rather the story of \\"Leninism\\" and the creation and consequences of the Leninist system that ran the USSR for over 70 years.  Important events in Lenin's life before the October Revolution are skimmed over. For example Lenin's seminal work \\"What Is To Be Done\\" is simply mentioned in passing.  However, in spite of this, the book is very worth reading, especially by someone who is not well-informed about Soviet history.  Volkogonov, who died in 1995, warned that the perversion of morality that Lenin and Leninism brought to Russia did immense damage to the country and its people and this will make the rooting of truly democratic institutions in that country very difficult, in spite of the collapse of the Leninism system. This has proven prophetic as we now see Putin slowly restoring an authoritarian system in that country which has suffered so much in the 20th century.	2004-11-07

All of this is covered in this book. <br />One of the most important features of this book is an historical survey of the growth of the body of knowledge of the other bodies in the Solar System, starting with the invention of the telescope in the 17th century, and how this has evolved with improvements in observational technology down to our own time. <br />The author then leads us to the important question regarding the possible uniqueness of life on Earth, and why, if it is unique, this should be the case, especially considering that Earth's neighbors, Mars and Venus are similar to Earth in many ways and yet have evolved in radically different directions which are inimical to the sustenance of life as we know it (of course, the discovery of living organisms in hydrothermal vents where there is no oxygen at the bottom of the ocean is forcing scientists to broaden their views of what life-friendly environments are really like).  For example, only the Earth, among the four terrestrial planets has a large, natural satellite. Why is this? If the Moon didn't exist there would be no life on Earth because the presence of the Moon keeps the Earth's orbit stable and prevents the obliquity of the spin axis from changing.  All this leads to a stable thermal environment, vital for life to exist.  Similarly, it is now believed that the water present on Earth was brought to the planet from comets originating in the outer Solar System.  Another important question is why the Earth has plate tectonics whereas Mars certainly doesn't and Venus probably doesn't.  Thus, we see that in order to understand our own planet, it is vital to understand the process that work on all the others and to know what is happening even at the outermost reaches of the Solar System.  This book surveys all these matters, giving the layman a comprehensive picture of the current state of knowledge. <br />The book has an extensive glossary, but I would primarily recommend it to someone who has at least some college-level background in physics, engineering or other physical science in order to fully appreciate it.	2004-09-02
US	52274159	R19PM7J7I1NSU	0195134389	824618349	Shostakovich: A Life	Books	1	36	61	N	N	An Injustice To A Great Man	aDmitri Shostakovich (DDS) was probably the gretest composer of the 20th century.  Unfortunately, a burning controversy has unjustly erupted around  the perceptions of his personality and actions during his illustrious career regarding the question of whether he was a principled opponent of the totalitarian <br />Communist and Stalinist regime of the USSR, or whether he was a passive opportunist who used his talents to ensure a comfortable life for himself at the expense of his moral integrity.  In 1979 Solomon Volkov published DDS's memoirs in the West.  This showed DDS to be a bitter opponent of the regime, writing music that reflected this, while at the same time, castigating himself for the public face he had to show ostensibly in support of the system (just as everyone else had to do in order to survive especially during Stalin's terror, but also during other, more supposedly \\"relaxed\\" periods).  The author of this book being reviewed, Laurel Fay, has devoted the last 25 years to a crusade trying to discredit Volkov and the image of DDS he presented to the world, saying that while DDS was a great composer, his music doesn't reflect any protest against the system which he willingly accomodated himself to.  This biography is another contribution to this argument. <br />Unfortunately for her position, the fall of the Communist regime in the USSR has allowed many friends and relatives of DDS to speak openly for the first time and their view of him overwhelmingly strengthens the view of DDS provided by Volkov's book \\"Testimony\\" and rebuts Fay's point of view. <br />Fay seems to be oblivious to the terrible dilemmas that people faced living in the totalitarian regime that was the USSR and there was terrible pressure on everyone to conform.  This book contains many quotations of what people call \\"source material\\" consisting of quotations from articles in Pravda (the USSR's official newspaper) and other \\"official sources\\".  Fay accepts these basically uncritically, apparently unaware that these organs of communication did not exist in order to provide information to their readers, but rather to propagandize in favor the the regime, regardless of the truth.  She does acknowledge in the book that articles that had DDS's name on them, supposedly indicating that he had written them, often were written by others and submitted to him for his signature, which he provided without even looking at the manuscript, but she then goes on to say that this doesn't necessarily mean that he DIDN'T <br />agree with what was written there.  Fay does not bring any proof for this statement, and so the reader has no way of knowing which viewpoints expressed in the articles DDS supposedly agreed with.  Perceptive people in the USSR ignored the propaganda entirely and didn't take what was written in these \\"official\\" organs seriously at all. <br />Fay also claims that DDS's composing his famous \\"From Jewish Folk Poetry\\" in 1948 which was rejected by the establishment musical authorities because of the the gathering \\"anti-Cosmopolitan\\" (i.e. anti-Jewish) campaign was the result of a pathetic attempt to please the authorities by writing music based on traditional folk music of the various nationalities of the USSR and it was just his \\"rotten luck\\" to choose a group that would soon be under attack.  This claim of Fay's is nonsense because the the anti-Jewish attitude of the regime started already in 1942 and was accelerating in 1948.  DDS had many Jewish friends and contacts with people in high places and was quite aware of what was going on.  He wrote this piece as a protest against the regime's anti-Semitism!  Fay is again oblivious to this. <br />Finally, Fay views DDS's joining the Communist Party in 1960 as another attempt to promote his personal interests, yet Fay has fallen for the prevailing myth that after Stalin died and the \\"Thaw\\" began under Khruschev, the regime stopped terrorizing the intelligentsia.  In reality, there was still coercion, but it was done in a more subtle manner.  Instead of threatening arrest and deportation to the Gulag, people could be threatened instead by refusing to allow one's children into good schools  and jobs, or possibly, in DDS's case, refusal to allow decent medical care since his health was deteriorating.  DDS castigated himself because he felt he had capitulated to the system, but it is probable that he had no other choice.  As one gets older, it is harder and harder to keep up the frontal struggle. <br /> <br />In summary, a reader interested in the life of DDS would be better served by reading \\"Testimony\\", Elizbeth Wilson's \\"Shostakovich-A Life Remembered\\", Ho and Feofanov's \\"Shostakovich Reconsidered\\" and by looking at thewritings of the late Ian MacDonald on his \\"Music Under Soviet Rule\\" website.	2004-08-26

Thanks to movies like &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, and many others, the impression is gained that the United States and Britain carried the bulk of the war against Nazi Germany, but the fact is that 3/4 of the entire strength of the German Wehrmacht was destroyed by the USSR's Red Army. Although many fine books have been written in the US and Britain about this war, most of them have been written more for people who already have a strong background in WWII, but this book makes the story of battle marking the turning point of the war, Stalingrad, accessible to the general public. The book is written in a form that was made popular in the 1960's and 1970's bringing vignettes both from the political and military leaders as well as the experiences of ordinary people caught up in the maelstrom. Famous encounters in the engagement such as the &quot;Battle of the Grain Elevator&quot; or &quot;Pavlov's House&quot; are described, bringing the horror of the &quot;rattenkrieg&quot; (rat's war) in the ruins of the city to the reader. Craig points out how the indescriminate bombing of the city as a prelude to the German attack which killed tens of thousands of civilians including the deliberate strafing of columns of civilians trying <br /> to flee to the east bank of the Volga river ended up backfiringon the Germans, enabling the Soviet defenders to turn the rubble into improvised fortresses forcing the Germany's vaunted Sixth Army into fighting house-to-house, cellar to cellar, street to street, and sometimes room to room, something they were unused to, coming from successful blitzkrieg, mobile warfare, campaigns. He also points out that in spite of the fact that the German army was famous for discipline, when the German pocket (the &quot;kessel&quot;) was in danger of falling to the Soviets, many soldiers made self-inflicted wounds in order to be flown out or they would defy orders and storm the waiting aircraft, even though they had not been given permissionto be evacuated.. <br /> A couple of items should be mentioned as corrections to the book, however. First of all, Craig calls Sixth Army commander  <br /> Friedrich von Paulus, but Paulus came from a family that was not part of the Prussian Military aristocracy, so &quot;von&quot; was not part of his name. <br /> Secondly, this book was written in the early 1970's, before the fall of the Communist regime. Antony Beevor has written another popular-style book about Stalingrad based on research done since then and he brings new facts to light. Among them is his skepticism about the famous duel that was believed to occur between Soviet master sniper Vassily Zaitsev and the German Konings. Although this story was circulated for many years and Craig recounts in this book, Beevor says there is reason to doubt whether it really occurred (this story forms the backdrop of the movie with the same title of this book, which is not really based on the book, unfortunately). <br /> In summary, I strongly recommend this book, in addition to Beevor's to really get a feeling for the titanic, inhuman struggle that was the Russo-German front in the Second World War.	2004-07-30

This book describes the efforts of von Braun and his team to build and operate the V-2.  3200 of these rockets were fired in anger, mostly at London and Antwerp.  Von Braun and many from his team in Germany became prominent personalities in the Unites States space program, some of the well-known to the public at large.  What is less well known is that the people who actually produced the rockets for operational use were part of an army of slaves who were terrorized, brutalized and murdered under the watchful eye of the dreaded SS.<BR>It took nine years of development to get the V-2 to an operational status and the author describes the technological, administrative and political difficulties von Braun and his people faced.  At one point, SS chief Heinrich Himmler tried to get control of the program as part of his \\"empire building\\".  In order to accomplish this, he had Von Braun arrested for a short time.  Von Braun's apologists in the US in later years pointed to this in order to whitewash his checkered background, claiming that he was really anti-Nazi.  However, the author shows that his arrest had nothing to do with any \\"anti-Nazi\\" beliefs he may have had, but was simply part of Himmler's power play, made in order to pressure the heads of the program to agree to the SS's take-over attempt.<BR>The author describes the horrors in which the slave-labor team worked in building and operating the Mittelwerk plant where the operational rockets were produced and the connections between this and von Braun's team.  Von Braun is shown to have not had any direct connection with these atrocities, although he did hold the rank of Captain in the SS, but others,who later played a prominent role in the US space program, such as Arthur Rudolph had direct responsibility, which towards the end of his life, led to his depotation from the United States.<BR>One of the most interesting points brought out in the book was the fact that the V-2 program ended up being a disaster for Nazi Germany.  It was comparable in size and cost, relative to Germany's war economy, to the American Manhattan Project which successfully developed the A-bomb, yet the total weight of explosives sent by the V-2's was less than that delivered by a single large RAF bombing raid.  The rocket program ate up scare resources that could have been better invested in other types of armaments.  The major irony is that the ultimate benefit from this massive investment by the German taxpayer was not reaped by them, but by Germany's enemy, the United States and its successful space program.<BR>The book is written in a dry style, so for that reason I give it only 4 stars, but it is still a very important and interesting book.	2004-07-16

There is no question his music is the one the most profound artistic forms of dissidence against the evil regime of the USSR that was ever produced.  It is all there in the music, and as DDS himself said &quot;He who has ears, will hear!&quot;<BR>Some examples:<br />Symphony No. 4 - written in 1936, after the horrors of farm collectivization and the first 5-year plan (&quot;2+2=5&quot;).  Opens with a shriek of pain and is very cacophanous.<BR>Symphony No. 5 - written in 1937, the height of the Great Terror.<BR>Ends what seems to be triumphant note (like a speech which ends with &quot;Long Live Comrade Stalin and the Communist Party of the USSR!&quot;), but if played correctly, sounds like someone is being beaten over the head and told to rejoice against his will.<BR>Symphony No. 7 - The famous &quot;Leningrad symphony&quot;  has a march tune which ignorant apparatchiks said represents the approach of the German Army, but since it is in a major key and is most definitely NOT a military march, really represents the sweetness and light that Communism promises at first, but which later ends up becoming a nightmare.<BR>Symphony No. 8  -  The third movement represents (in my opinion) an agitprop session beating propaganda into people's heads.<BR>Symphony No. 9 - written at the end of the war, instead of being a grotesque paean of praise to Stalin as was expected, has a light, humorous opening saying the joke is on all those who thought the situation in the USSR would improve after the war.<BR>Symphony no. 12 - a piece in &quot;praise&quot; of Lenin.  Sounds &quot;bad&quot;<BR>and uninspired, but that was DDS's intention in saying what he really thinks about Lenin.<BR>Symphony No. 13 -  the &quot;Babi Yar&quot; symphony, openly dissident work<BR>condemning state and personal anti-Semitism.<br />In this book, DDS tells us what he was trying to say in these pieces and others.  His courage along with his self-admitted weaknesses make him a compelling figure in history.  Read this and see how a hero coped living in one of the most nightmarish regimes in history.	2004-06-13

The thesis of the author is that the Arab world has been unable to break the shackles of its ancient tribal-clan organization of society and build a new civil society found in other parts of the world, particularly in the democratic West.  While it is true that in the distant past, all societies were more or less organized on these tribal and clan lines, the more advanced cultures moved onwards and developed societies in which interpersonal and later international relations were based not only on blood kinship but rather on a feeling of mutually-shared responsibility for the world outside their immediate surroundings.  Tragically the Arab (and to a large extent, also the Islamic) world has not yet made this shift of mind, whereas others outside Europe and America such as East Asia have succeeded.  The author shows that relationships between individual people and countries in the Arab world are made up mostly of suspicion and fear of those outside the \\"closed circle\\" of the clan (or country) and this prevents the development of the type of civil society necessary for the development of freedom, democracy and economic prosperity.  As a result, all Arabs countries have autocratic or tyrranical regimes that repress their own populations, stifle economic development and are in constant conflict with their neighbors, both Arab and non-Arab.<BR>In what the author calls the \\"careerist\\" mentality, he points out that the Arab leaders cynically exploit various Western and non-Western ideologies in order to advance their own personal ambitions, and then they jettison these ideologies once they have the power of the police state behind them which ensures the permanence of their rule.  For example, both Syria and Egypt have governments which are called \\"revolutionary, socialist and progressive\\", but which, in reality simply confiscated the wealth of the old, pre-revolutionary elite and put it into the hands of a new elite indistinguishable from the old one in its rapaciousness and greed, not benefitting the average citizen in whose name the revolution was carried out.  Syria by the beginning of the new century had reverted to being a hereditary monarchy and Egypt was also on the way to becoming one.  The book also shows how Baathist ideologue Michel Aflaq first modelled his political ideas on Nazism and Fascism and then easily shifts towards Marxism.  Arafat first espouses Marxism and allies himself the Soviet Union but, today, he is running a terrorist regime with a semi-Islamicist ideology under the sponsorship of the Europeans and to some extent the Americans.<BR>The book shows how the corrupt autocrats in power shift the blame for the povery and underdevolpment of their countries from themselves onto fanciful \\"Zionist-Imperialist\\" conspiracies and \\"colonialist exploitation\\" without explaining how countries like Japan and Germany became prosperous despite having been under foreign military occupation much harsher than anything the Arabs had experienced.<BR>Finally, the author shows great foresight in predicting that the terribly diseased regime and society in Saudi Arabia was not only oppressing its own citizens, but how it would become a threat to the whole world.<br />Although I would have preferred that the author go into more depth in some areas, especially the effects of 20th century urbanization on the clan identity of the Arabs (in other parts of the world, moving to the cities broke down existing links and sentiments of the people involved), this book is must reading for someone who wants to understand the turbulence of the Arab world.	2003-08-03

The positive one portrays John, Robert and Ted Kennedy as liberal \\"saints\\" committed to a progressive revolution in America.  The negative one shows the Kennedys to be rapacious libertines who throw off all social conventions in their personal and political lives.  Leamer's book transcends these over-simplistic views and covers the lives of patriarch Joseph P Kennedy and his four sons, bringing out the complexity of this unique group of people.<br />Those who hold a negative view of the Kennedys will find much material to confirm their beliefs.  In truth, Joe Kennedy seems to be a man with almost no redeeming virtues, a virulent anti-Semite and pro-Nazi, greedy and miserly, manipulative man.  The second generation of Kennedys learned not to ask where the family's money came from.  Yet Joe Kennedy went on to implement needed reforms in the Security and Exchange commission to which he was appointed, supported the progressive FDR and became the most powerful Catholic in the US.<br />Similarly, JFK went on to be an incredibly reckless philanderer who possibly compromised the very security of the US with liasons with women involved with organized crime and possibly even East German intelligence, but at the same time, he inspired young people to volunteer for the Peace Corps and set American on course to landing on the Moon.  RFK goes to work for family friend Senator Joe McCarthy and works with the Mafia in order to destablize Castro's regime in Cuba, but then also works vigorously against the same Mafia and institutionalized racial discrimination (and somehow escapes the taint of his association with McCarthy).<br />Leamer show that JFK and RFK were definitely not \\"soft liberals\\".  JFK was the best friend the \\"military-industrial complex\\" ever had, pouring unprecedented amounts of money into defense and space projects.  They supported a very tough anti-Communist policyin Cuba and Vietnam which almost led to nuclear war and did lead to the quagmire in Southeast Asia.  One important point about the book is that Leamer does not demonize various \\"bad guys\\" from the positive Kennedy Myth, such as General Curtis Lemay and other military men from the Cuban Missile Crisis, FBI Director J Edgar Hoover who was friendly for many years with Joe Kennedy and showed great forebearance with the many indiscretions of his sons and had good reason to be concerned with JFK's behavior and finally Lyndon Johnson who loyally served the Kennedy Administration and yet was treated with contempt by RFK and many of JFK's advisors (although not by JFK himself).<br />Finally, the author has come to the same conclusion that other investigators have arrived at regarding JFK's assassination, namely, that it is very likely that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald was motivated, either with or without the knowledge of agents of Fidel Castro, to kill Kennedy in revenge for the Kennedys' attempt to kill him.<br />It is not easy to cover the lives of five different men in a singel book, and much had to be left out, but as an introduction to this remarkable tribe of American aristocracy, this book is indispensable.	2003-06-30
US	52274159	R3T2I2UNGQIDYK	1560988479	403343846	The Once and Future Moon	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Manifesto For Mankind's Return to the Moon	Dr Paul Spudis is one of the preeminent lunar geologists today and in his book he makes an eloquent argument for the importance of continuing manned exploration of the moon which ended with the return of Apollo 17 in December 1972.<br />The book is divided into two parts.  The first gives a description of the bulk characteristics of the moon.  He then goes into a fairly detailed description of what exploration of the moon has revealed in terms of lunar geology.  The geological part of the book is written on the level of the &quot;educated layman&quot; so some might find it difficult by a glossary is provided that helps considerably.  Spudis is not afraid to challenge the &quot;commonly accepted wisdom&quot;. For example, he expresses a healthy skepticism about parts of the now largely accepted &quot;big whack theory&quot; that says a Mars-sized primordial object impacted the fledgling earth in a glancing blow that ejected a large amount of material into space which went into orbit around the earth and later coalesced inot the Moon and also greatly speeded up the earth's rotation about its axis.  Spudis says the theory is so broad that it is used to explain away inconvenient data of which he provides examples.<br />The last part of the book consists of ideas on how the Moon could be explored and colonized in the future on an economically viable basis.  For example the lunar regolith (soil) consists of a lot of oxygen which could be extracted.  Similarly, the Clementine and Lunar Prospector spacecraft have possibly found water in the permanently shaded regions of craters near the lunar north and south poles which could be exploited in order to &quot;live off the land&quot;.<br />Finally, Spudis makes an eloquent plea for the continuation of manned exploration of space pointing out that it is not enough to use robot spacecraft, but only man himself, on the spot, can really understand and analyze what is being seen firsthand, as well as having the ability to overcome unforeseen problems and malfunctions.  Since the Moon is much closer to the Earth than Mars is and is much cheaper and easier to reach, the Moon is the logical choice as the next destination for continued exploration of the Solar System.	2003-06-27

It is said that many of the Muslims who were involved in recent dramatic world events were followers of his ideas. His commentary on the Quran was designed to give the believing Muslim the tools to understand the crisis of modern Islam in which the liberal democratic states of the West are dynamic and dominant whereas the the Muslim states are, by and large, sunk into cultural, economic, industrial and scientific stagnation. He attributes this to what he calls \\"jahilliya\\", which is a modern reinterpretation of the state of \\"ignorance\\" the pre-Islamic tribes of Arabia were in. Although these modern states call themselves \\"Muslim\\", Qutb says they have abandoned the true path because they have allowed the original, pure Islam to be contaminated by Western ideas which are propagated by Christians and, more specifically, Jews. In his commentary on the Sura, \\"The Cow (al Baqarah)\\" he states: \\"The war launched by the Jews many hundreds of years ago against Islam and Muslims continues today unabated\\". Here we see an authentic Islamic revivalist thinker, in a pure and unadulterated form, present his belief that the problems of the Muslim world are due to consiracies that \\"evil, scheming outsiders\\" are supposedly spinning, and if only they purge themselves of these \\"outsiders\\", everything will be well. This important commentary on the Quran should ring warning bells among those who cherish freedom and oppose the hatred and racism presented here in order to understand the challenge this form of Islam is presenting to the world.	2003-05-25

Therefore, I think the fact that a significant fraction of the book is devoted to describing what happened in the war before the German's began their offensive towards Stalingrad and the Caucasus is worthwhile.<BR>I do agree with other reviewers who state that the actual fighting inside Stalingrad is not described adequately.  Two legendary engagements within the city (the Battle of the Grain Elevator and \\"Pavlov's House\\") are just given a few lines each.  A more detailed description of what the fighters on each side went through would have given a real taste of how the campaign has fought.<BR>On the other hand, Beevor does make some important points that have have been glossed over in other accounts of the battle.  First, unlike other writers, Beevor does not portray German Sixth Army commander Paulus as just a simple-minded lackey of [dictator] who led his men into disaster and then refused to try to save them after they were cut off inside the \\"Kessel\\".  Beevor points out that the Sixth Army was in very poor condition at the time of Manstein's attempt to reach the Kessel and so it would not have been possible for the Sixth Army to punch through the Soviet ring. Similarly, he also points out that not all the Rumanian troops fighting on the side of the Germans were incompetant bunglers as they are often portrayed. <BR>Beevor also makes clear that Goebbels' infamous \\"Total War\\" campaign, begun just at the time the Sixth Army surrendered, was a thinly disguised attempt to create another \\"stab-in-the back\\" legend (as in the 1918 armistice), i.e. to shift the blame for the disaster from [dictator] and the [German] leadership onto the traditional aristocracy and the Army high command which was an important component of theGerman (or really, Prussian) ruling elite.  <BR>Finally, Beevor makes clear that the German prisoners could not expect to receive treatment much better than that  which they gave to the Soviet prisoners they had previously captured and who were starved and brutalized in the millions.  This explains why half of the 91,000 prisoners taken died within 3 months and why only 5,000 survived to return to Germany in the 1950's.	2003-04-27

Although most of his books cover raids that did not go well for the Allies (Nuremberg, Schweinfurt-Regensburg, and the Battle of Berlin), this book covers one of RAF Bomber Commands biggest successes (the US Eigth Air Force also carried out daylight raids as part of the Battle of Hamburg but they were not so successful).  Middlebrook explains how \\"everything came together\\" for the RAF, most especially the introduction of \\"Window\\" which rendered the German defenders' radar useless; and the weather which made the incendiary bombs particularly effective in starting massive fires which lead to the horrific firestorm that caused so many fatalities.  Middlebrook not only describes the attacking force, but also the defensive measures taken on the ground by the Germans and the experiences of the civilian population caught up in this nightmarish experience.<BR>The author points out that regarding the bomb-load mix in this raid, the ratio of incendiaries to high-explosive bombs was no different than usual and it was the combination of circumstances that lead to the massive destruction (incidentally-he also points out that the Germans used incendiaries in their bombing raids on London and Coventry in 1940 and 1941 so the RAF can not be blamed for starting this type of warfare)<BR>This book, like his others, is highly recommended.	2003-03-06

Yes, he is quite opinionated about many people and things in the book, but he built  manned spaceflight's mission control from the ground up.  Kraft most definitely &quot;did it all&quot; so he is entitled to his opinion.  What I found most suprising (and pleasing) is his hostility to Wernher von Braun and his Germans who worked on the V2 rocket. During the 1960's I all saw the VIP's of the manned space program laughing together and I (and many others) felt uncomfortable about this, while at the same time recognizing the Germans' contribution to the American space program, most notably the Saturn V moon rocket without which President Kennedy's goal of reaching the moon by the end of the 1960's would have been impossible. Still, the Germans used slave labor to build the V2's and something like 10,000 prisoners died in the hellish conditions of the Mittelwerk where they were built, and some of Von Braun's people were directly involved in these war crimes.  Reading this book shows that this also weighed on people like Kraft and his mentor Bob Gilruth.  I respect Kraft's honesty for admitting his mixed feelings on the matter and it gives the ring of truth to the other controversial things he says in the book.<br />This book is an historical document and is a must for anyone interested in the history of the manned space program or the development of technology in general.	2003-02-21

The tragedy of Leah Rabin is that her narrow-mindedness brought about her psychological downfall when she failed to see how the disastrous agreement with Arafat brought massive bloodshed and war in spite of her broad experience which is outlined in the book. This was sadly demonstrated on the night in 1996 when Benyamin Netanyahu defeated her husband's successor, Shimon Peres, in the election for Prime Minister and she told a reporter that she intended \\"to pack up her bags and leave the country\\". In the end, she stayed, but this unfortunately shows the mentality of so many people on the \\"establishment Left\\" in Israel, that they consider the country to be their personal property and their loyalty to it is conditioned on their being in power. She would often state that she viewed Arafat as a \\"personal friend of the family\\" and at the same time she would denounce the opponents of her political movement (the majority of the country) as fascists, a type of political terminology that went out of style in the 1970's. She reached her nadir in her final public statement before she died which was a call for \\"Shimon (Peres) to sit down with Arafat and reach an agreement to stop the violence\\" a meeting that in the end produced nothing. This tragically shows how truly out-of-touch she was with reality. It was inconceivable to her that \\"her friend\\" who had said so many nice things to her would at the same time conduct a war against her country. <BR>I must add, though, that the book is important to read because of her frank account of the night of Rabin's assassination in which she states how the SHABAK (Israel Secret Service) bundled her off and kept assuring her for a long time that the shooting \\"was not real\\" and that Yitzhak was all right. This certainly lends credence to those who claim that the SHABAK set up some sort of \\"game\\" in which there would be an attempted assassination as a \\"provocation\\" to make the right-wing political opposition look bad, but something went wrong and he was killed. In spite of my strong opposition to her political views, I respect her candor.	2002-12-06

However, there was a time when the US and USSR were allies in the fight against another form of tyranny, i.e. during the Second World War. At that time, the Russian people were portrayed in the US as valiant soldiers striking hard blows at the Nazi enemy, whereas their evil leader's deeds were whitewashed. Finally, after reading this book in the 1980's, I finally came to realize that the Russian people were were like many other people in the world, trying to survive and get a little enjoyment out of life, but forced to cope with war and terror brought by regimes lead by two of the most despicable leaders in human history. The horrible situation forces otherwise decent people to turn their backs on their friends, or even inform on them. Those of us who lived in the Western democracies can have no concept of what this was like. The story revolves around the Battle of Stalingrad which the author witnessed first hand as a journalist. The immense efforts the Soviet people made to liberate their country from the German invader, all the while having their own regime breathing down their necks shows what greatness people can achieve under the most adverse conditions. Although one of the other reviewers says this is not a story of \\"the triumph of the human spirit\\", and as I indicated above, many good people were broken by the moral dilemmas they faced, we can all be grateful that eventually the Communist regimes collapsed without bloodshed and we must realize that the basis for this was set by the sacrifices of Vassily Grossman's generation and we should also be thankful that his manuscript survived the attempts of the regime to bury it in order to tell us what that horrific time and place in history was like. <br />	2002-10-18

It is very interesting and fun. One part that I felt was missing was descriptions. Kristy didn't actually describe what it was like to be the star of the play. She was rather passive to it. I can't understand it, since at my school I was picked to play the lead role, Maria, in \\"The Sound of Music\\", and it was such an exciting adventure, and so amazing to do. I was the center of attention, having never wanting it ever before. In fact, it opened me up so much, personality-wise. It is something I will never ever forget. I felt that Kristy did not convey any of this.<br />I enjoyed reading this book a great deal. It was so similar to the way we put on our production at school. All the excitment, the anxiety, the tears and fights, the magic that went through the audience. The most amazing thing that I felt when I was on stage, and Jackie Rodowsky says this too, was the ability to make the audience laugh. You are give such a great force, only because you are the one in the spotlight.

Mike Collins puts the reader right into the spacecraft alongside the author.  He also describes the training  the astronauts went through as well as short but colorful descriptions of his fellow astronauts.  It is indeed unfortunate that none of the twelve men who walked on the moon has written an account that is of the caliber of this book.   A reader interested in the Apollo program from the viewpoint of the men who flew in it should read, in addition to this book,  Andrew Chaikin's masterpiece &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot; and can skip the other astronaut autobiographies.	2002-07-12

The book gives the background of legendary aerospace leader Harrison Storms and NAA starting from his windtunnel work after the attack on Pearl Harbor, demonstrating the feasiblilty of launching B-25 bombers off the deck of an aircraft carrier which enabled Jimmy Doolittle to carry out his audacious raid on Tokyo, through the development of the famous P-51 Mustang, F-86, and F-100 fighters, up to the Mach 3 B-70 bomber and X-15 rocket plane.  Based on this wealth of experience, Storms persuaded NAA to form the Space and Information Systems in Downey, California and to make a serious bid for the contract to build the Apollo spacecraft which was ultimately succesful.  Unfortunately, the Apollo 1 fire which took the lives of astronauts Grissom, White and Chaffee in 1967 tarnished the reputation of Storms and NAA and led to questioning whether NAA should have been given the contract at all, but based on the successes of the past, NAA was well qualified to  build the spacecraft as the astronauts who were picked to fly it felt at the time.<br />The weakness of the book is that it seems to give full backing to Storms' contention that nothing at all was wrong with the way things were done at Downey.  In fact, the books written by Mike Collins, Frank Borman and Chris Kraft point out that they were unhappy with NAA before the fire but the immense time pressure to get to the Moon before 1970 led people at NAA and NASA to sweep problems under the carpet until it was too late.<br />The most fascinating parts of the book describe the various technological challanges that had to be overcome in building the spacecraft, such as how Monte-Carlo methods were used to determine the \\"worst-case\\" scenarios the Command Module could encounter on landing in the ocean so that it could be designed to protect the astronauts, the packing of the landing parachutes which required compressing them in a vacuum chamber so that they could fit in a very small space, and the extreme weight limitations on the S-II second stage of the Saturn V moon rocket which required breakthroughs in many new manufacturing technologies and materials science.<br />I found this book to be very inspiring in showing how a vast team of talented people can come together and do something great.	2002-07-12

Although there were a number of dynamic Jewish religious leaders who took up the mantle of leadership in order to rebuild the shattered remnants of the Jewish world in the wake of the Holocaust such as the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik and the Satmar Rov, their message was basically directed at a relatively small group of Jews.  Rav Kook has a message for the entire Jewish people.  His great contributions were: (1) to emphasize the dynamic nature of both the spiritual and physical worlds, and, one the one hand, tell the traditional religious Jew that the Torah is flexible and can stand up to the challenges of modernity and change, while on the other hand demonstrating the perpetual relevance of the Torah to the Jew who has a less than full commitment to it; and (2) to demonstrate the absolute necessity of the Jewish people to return to the Land of Israel and build a modern society rooted in the Torah.  This fine book gives a sampling of these ideas and is a good introduction to the mind of this remarkable thinker.	2002-07-03

However, this led to wondering what ultimately was discovered on the moon. I then read this fine book and found it very interesting. At the time it was published, there was almost no material available in popular form on the scientific findings of Apollo and the other unmanned spaceflights to the moon so this was a pioneering work. In recent years, other books have appeared that also deal with the lunar discoveries, most notably Paul Spudis' \\"The Once and Future Moon\\" and David M Harland's \\"Exploring the Moon\\". I would have appreciated this book more if I had first read one or both of these other books because Wilhelms assumes the reader has some background in geology which was not the case with me. Once the reader gets up to speed on the basic geology which is provided in those other books, one can appreciate more the historical perspective that the author gives on how our current understanding of the Moon's past and present have developed over the last couple hundred years. In addition to the science, Wilhelms gives colorful descriptions of the major figures in lunar science including Nobel Prize Winner Harold Urey, Ralph Baldwin, Gene Shoemaker, Hal Masursky, \\"Mr Moondust\\" Thomas Gold, as well as the various astronauts who were recruited (sometimes unwillingly) into the lunar science fraternity. I believe that in order to understand any branch of science, it is important to see the evolution of ideas leading to our current knowledge and this book is an excellent source of information on the development of lunar science for the scientifically educated layman.	2002-06-21

The book gives an overview of the history of the British Raj and the subsequent partition but lacks balance. As other reviewers have pointed out, the book tends to idealize Gandhi (although it does point out how many of his followers ended up distancing themselves from him due to his various personal quirks and bizarre utopian economic and industrial schemes), as well as Nehru and the Congress Party and, on the other hand, demonizes Jinnah and the Muslim League. This book repeats the claim that the demand from Jinnah for partition was only a personal crusade of his and had people known he was dying of lung disease they would have waited for him to leave the scene and other, more \\"moderate\\" Muslim leaders would have stepped forward and agreed to remain in a united India. Another book I have read, \\"End of Empire\\", points out that in a conference held after the end of World War II, Jinnah agreed to accept loosely federated united Indian state but the Congress party rejected the proposal so it is incorrect to say the the \\"blame\\" for partition is solely Jinnah's. Jinnah was a totally unreligious Muslim who was an early member of the Congress party and believed in Hindu-Muslim cooperation but he opposed Gandhi's religiously-based civil disobedience campaign, fearing correctly that it would lead to violence and sectarianism. In the provinicial governments set up after the Indian elections held in 1937 the Congress party often refused to share power with Muslims in provinces where Hindus were the majority. This led Jinnah to the conclusion that Indian must be partitioned, a policy he opposed when it was first proposed in the early 1930's. In any event, the rise of Muslim conciousness around the world in the post-War era and its increasing rejection of secular politcs would have almost certainly lead to turmoil in the heavily Muslim parts of a united India as we see happening in Kashmir.<br />Similarly, the hypocrisy of Gandhi and Nehru are glossed over in the book. Gandhi, who demanded from his people that they make sacrifices in order to push the British out of India, turns around and tells the Jews who were being murdered by the Nazis and the Ethiopians being invaded by the Italians to passively accept their fate. Gandhi had the good fortune to confront the basically civilized and democratic British but he had no antidote to genocidal Fascism. Similarly Nehru, who preached passive resistance to the British had no problem sending the Indian Army into Portuguese-controlled Goa when he saw that Gandhi's way was not working fast enough. <br />Still, fairness requires stating that when all is said and done, when we compare modern India with the other giant nations, China and Russia, India, with all its flaws, has more or less remained a democracy and did not end up carrying out mass terror against its population as the other two did, so this speaks well for the country that Gandhi inspired and Nehru lead for so many years. This book gives the reader much of the background needed to understand this.	2002-05-10
US	52274159	R9KP7RLH26JQ	1853674737	885743805	Bomber Harris: His Life and Times The Biography of Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Arthur Harris,the Wartime Chief of	Books	4	14	19	N	Y	Profile of One of the Great Commanders of WW2	This book gives an interesting profile of one of the great commanders of World War 2. Although written in a dry style, it brings to light many little-known facts about this most controversial man.  Known as Bert to his friends, \\"Bomber Harris\\" to the press during the War, and \\"Butch\\" (short for \\"Butcher\\") to his aircrews, Harris took a demoralized and dispirited RAF Bomber Command in 1942 and built it up into a most formidable force that played a vital role in the defeat of Nazi Germany.  The author points out that the policy of night-time area bombing designed to destroys the cities that served as the locations of the German war industries was decided upon before Harris became Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command.  Within a few weeks, he put together the extremely risky Operation Millenium, the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne, whose success proved to skeptics the power and effectiveness that Bomber Command was capable of wielding.  Although it really took another two years to make the bombing campaign really effective, it has been proven beyond a doubt that German war production was severely damaged by the bombing campaign since it has been shown that German production increased rapidly when Bomber Command was forced to change its targets from the German cities to others in France related to Operation Overlord in the first months of 1944.<BR>It is true that Bomber Command suffered high casualties (a crewman had only a 30% chance of surviving a 30-operations tour of duty) but their sacrifices helped keep Stalin and the USSR in the war in 1942 and 1943 at the time when they were suffering immense losses and the prospect of a Second Front looked far away (Churchill was always afraid that Stalin might secretly make a deal with Hitler and pull out of the War).  Harris worked diligently day and night to get the resources and aircraft Bomber Command needed and to keep the morale of his personnel high.  Although he refrained from visiting the air fields, probably due to areluctance to face men who could possibly be flying to their deaths in a few hours, as well as the knowledge that the station commanders could be putting on a \\"show\\" for him that masked real problems, he did maintain continuous contact with low-ranking people from the air and ground crews in order to find out help them do their jobs more effectively and comfortably.<br />Probert, although very sympathetic with Harris, does not hesitate to point out flaws in his subject's personality.  For example, Harris broke up his first marriage by having an affair while he was away from home and after his divorce he had a problematic relationship with his children.  After the War, Harris developed a strange admiration for Hermann Goering who was not the \\"noble knight of the air\\" that some may have thought but was one of the most powerful and cruel of the Nazi hierarchy and was one of the key figures in the Nazi terror even before Hitler's rise to power and who played in role in the Holocaust.  Similarly, Harris opposed the Nuremberg Trials. He also said he only felt \\"hatred\\" for the Germans once, during the bombing of London whereas others like Battle of Britain hero Group Captain Douglas Bader was not ashamed to say years after the War that he hated the Germans for the evil they brought to the world.  In any event, perhaps these quirks gave him the personality traits that were needed to cooly, night after night, send thousands of young man on very dangerous missions to bring death and destruction to the German enemy. Maybe someone more sentimental and emotional, both to his family and to the enemy, would not be able to stand up to the strain.  We could perhaps compare him to other great commanders like Generals Patton, Montgomery and MacArthur who also had personalities that rubbed many people the wrong way:<BR>Probert also demolishes myths that have sprung up after the War  such as:<BR> (1) Harris ordered the supposedly unnecessary bombing of Dresden when Germany was already supposedly defeated out of some sense of blood-lust and vengeance.  In reality, he opposed the mission since it was located in eastern Germany and would expose his aircrews to extra danger due to the longer trip, but the allied leaders insisted on having the raid carried out since it was not at all clear at that time that Germany was at the point of collapse and they wanted the Soviet Armies to advance into Germany as fast as possible<BR>(2)  Harris had a contempt for \\"colonials\\" and sent them on the more dangerous missions as cannon fodder in order to spare \\"real\\" Britishers.  In reality, Harris moved to Rhodesia as a young man and considered himself a Rhodesian.  After the War he went to live in South Africa, so he indeed considered himself a \\"colonial\\"<BR>(3)  Harris was not given a peerage after the War as were many other senior British military commanders because the Labour goverment felt \\"embarassed\\" by the strategic bombing campaign and wanted to forget about it.  In reality, there is some truth in the fact that people wanted to forget about the bombing campaign, and it is also a fact that no \\"campaign decoration\\" was given to the air and ground crews in Bomber Command, but Harris was indeed offered a peerage, but turned it down, partly as a protest against the refusal to grant a campaign medal, but also for personal reasons in that outside Britain (where he intended to live) a peerage was not necessarily viewed as something desirable.<br />All in all, this book is must reading for someone interested in World War 2, military history, and the characterists of a great military commander.	2002-04-19

In all, over 400 have been killed since the terrorist onslaught began in September 2000,  which means more Israelis have been killed since the Oslo \\"peace agreement\\" was signed than in the Six-Day War.  Peres, like many Israelis of his generation received a Marxist education which said man's overriding impulse is economic.  This book is based on that mistaken premise.  Peres thought that since, in the West, globalized economics and communications would lead to a weakening of nationalism, religion and other \\"parochial\\" concerns and lead to a world in which consumerism is the leading concern, the Middle East would soon follow suit and both the Jews and Arabs would abandon their former identities.   The atrocities of September 11, 2001 have brought many people to doubt this view of the world when it was discovered that the vast majority of the suicide terrorists who commandeered the aircraft came from middle class backgrounds in Saudi Arabia or Egypt.  Obviously, enjoying the money they had or acquiring more was not their top priority. They were avid users of the internet which Peres thought would be one of the main engines for globalization.  The terrorists and other extremists apparently used it, not for looking at \\"girlie\\" and rock video websites but for the propagation of hate.  Peres thought that the Oslo accords, based on his same materialist premises, would bring peace to Israel, but as I have pointed out, the body count listed above has proven that to be a false hope.  After several years of building some sort of economic infrastructure in the Palestinian-controlled areas, Arafat's war against Israel has brought devastation to his people, yet who, according to public opinion polls, overwhelmingly support his actions.  It must be pointed out that Hitler brought great economic development to Germany (for example, building the great Autobahn network), but in the end, the Germans' support for his megalomaniacal bid for glory brought untold devastation to their nation.  Thus, we see that irrational impulses in people ofter override their short-term economic interests.  It is sad to see how a man who contributed so much to Israel over so many years and was one of Israel's best Prime Ministers in his first term from 1984-1986 fell into such a pit of delusion.	2002-04-15

Unlike \\"Case Closed\\", the program has an open mind about the assassination (Posner also appears in it) but eventually comes to more or less the same conclusions as Posner--that Oswald was the lone gunman. However, whereas this book focuses single-mindedly on proving that he was the lone gunman and that there was no conspiracy, the program points out that the CIA has apparently hidden the fact that it had contact with Oswald when he returned from the Soviet Union and also that they apparently destroyed photographs and recordings made of Oswald's visit to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City (Former CIA Chief Richard Helms denies any wrongdoing). Even if the CIA is hiding something, though, it doesn't prove that they were involved in a conspiracy to murder the President. Similarly, a photograph of Oswald and David Ferrie (apparently) together in the mid 1950's is presented, but Posner is quoted that there is no proof that they even knew each other. Again, even if they did know each other, this doesn't prove there was a conspiracy. \\"Case Closed\\" tends to try to whitewash evidence that MAY point to conspiracy, but it clearly shows by focusing on Oswald's (and Jack Ruby's) personal histories as well as the hard evidence available (and there is a lot as Oswald's brother Robert points out) that the Warren Commission's conclusions are basically correct. Common sense says that the simplest explanation is usually correct and Posner convincingly shows that in this book.	2001-11-26

The book gives a survey of the history of the French Third Republic from its founding in the aftermath of the humiliating defeat at the hands of Prussia in 1870, through its crisis in the Dreyfus Affair, victory in World War I and finally to the debacle of 1940. The author has the unique background of being both an accomplished journalist as well as a serious historian which gives the book a very readable style. What particularly appealed to me is his moral passion. He is no &quot;objective, neutral observer&quot;. He is a Francophile who is willing to expose the terrible weaknesses that brought down the country he loves so much. The fact that he, as a newspaper correspondent, personally witnessed the horrors of Nazi Germany before the war gives a fervor to his writing that is refreshing in this day and age of viewing history as merely a comparison of the various &quot;narratives&quot; of the different sides in a conflict.<BR>Shirer begins by pointing out the important fact that at the constituent assembly that wrote the constitution for the Third Republic, the majority of the delegates were, in fact, monarchists, but they could not decide if the king should be from the House of Bourbon or Orleans, so a republican form of government was chosen as a compromise. Thus, the new regime started out on the wrong foot as something no one really wanted. Throughout its 70 years history there were always strong anti-republican movements that threatened the very existence of the regime, chronic political instability and resistance to necessary reforms (for example, women were given the vote only after World War 2). In the military realm, the exhaustion resulting from the terrible losses in World War 1 combined with a reluctance to change the strategies that worked then and obliviousness to major technological changes in armored and aerial warfare led to the ossification of the army high command and the development of the &quot;Maginot mentality&quot;.<BR>In spite of all the disadvantages, when the German invasion began in 1940, the French stood a good chance of halting the invader. It has been repeatedly demostrated in modern warfare that the defense is very strong and that the attacker usually needs to have a clear superiority in order to prevail. Shirer demolishes the myths propagated by French Commander Weygand and others that the Germans had overwhelming superiority. In numbers of men and tanks the two sides were pretty evenly matched and the French tanks were of superior quality. The French officer corps was also much more experienced than that of the Germans because of the restrictions of the Versailles Treaty. The Germans took unbelievably huge risks in mounting their main attack through the Ardennes where there were few roads and some well-aimed air or artillery attacks could have upset the whole German plan. It is true that the Luftwaffe had aerial superiority but the author shows that large numbers of French aircraft were inexplicably never sent into battle (the French Air Force had more aircraft available at the end of the campaign than at the beginning!) French troops fought valiantly in many engagements, especially in holding the perimeter at Dunkirk allowing many more men to escape back to England. This disproves the claim that all French felt resentment to the British or were not willing to fight to save their country.<BR>So, the question remains, what brought about the sudden collapse? Once Petain started talking about an armistice, resistance collapsed. The military setbacks were exploited by unscrupulous anti-republican leaders like Petain, Laval and Weygand in order to overthrow the hated republican regime.<BR>The disgrace of France in 1940 was not that they were defeated on the battlefield in metropolitan France. The British, Russians and Americans also suffered grievous setbacks early in the war before turning things around. The disgrace is that (1) they refused to continue the war from their colonies in North Africa where they could be protected by their powerful navy, (2) they accepted humiliating, immoral armistice terms that forced 1.5 million French POW's to remain interned for the duration of the war and  agreeing to hand over refugees who had found haven from the Nazis in democratic France, many of whom were subsequently murdered and (3) the pro-republican leaders (especially the Socialists) allowed themselves to be meekly stampeded into voting the republican regime out of existence and granted unlimited dictatorial powers to Petain who then set up a new regime called the &quot;French State&quot; (instead of &quot;Republic&quot;) which instituted a totalitarian regime that ultimately arrested the former leaders of the republic and other opponents (even murdering some of them like Mandel and Zay), handed Jews over to the Nazis to be annihilated and, finally, openly collaborating with them to the point of even agreeing to supplying the Germans with forced labor. Shirer mentions at the end of the book that many patriotic Frenchmen, years after the war, felt that their leaders were right in capitulating because &quot;it saved another bloodbath like that of 1914-1918&quot;. Shirer points out that France's freedom was restored by the sacrifice of millions of Russian, British and American lives (among others). I think this obtuseness, or, alternately, a strong feeling of shame, explains why many Frenchmen have such a prickly attitude to Americans.<BR>The lesson of this book is that a nation can have all the material, technological and military advantages but without internal solidarity, a sense of national dignity and a will to make sacrifices for its freedom, it can fall in an instant. This should serve as a warning for future generations.	2001-08-31

Ms. Martin thought of a wonderful idea-- each member of the BSC remembering something that happened in her/his life. This way the author could tell us about each character, but for once not going by a chronological order like she usually does.<br />There were some chapters that I liked more and some chapters that I liked less. For example:<br />I found it strange that when Dawn's parents were getting a divorce, their conversation with Dawn and Jeff was almost identical to the conversation Stacey's parents had with Stacey when they were getting a divorce, back in the book &quot;Welcome Back, Stacey!&quot;. It couldn't be (or could it?) that all parents who get divorced say the same thing to their kids, and that all kids whose parents are getting divorced react the same. This is the place for creativity, or else the readers get bored with the same material.<br />Speaking of the same material, there was another disturbing thing in the book. Logan's chapter. Logan described the time when he just met Mary Anne. I believe this story was frightfully unecessary since it is already described in great detail in book #10: &quot;Logan Likes Mary Anne&quot;. The only difference is that this time it's from Logan's point of view instead of Mary Anne's.<br />I liked Stacey's chapter. In almost every book she explains about her diabetes, and the awful life in New York when she was first diagnosed with the disease, but only in a few words. In this chapter she gave us the story like it was happening in the present, full with emotions and feelings. I was very sad to see how bad her life was.<br />Kristy had a good chapter, too. She described her first baby-sitting job ever, when she was in the fifth grade. For one thing, she was so adorable as a ten year old! I enjoyed that. Secondly, writing about Kristy's first job is interesting since she's the founder of the club.<br />I also enjoyed reading Jessi's entry. She describes the time when Squirt was born. I liked reading about her life in Oakley, NJ, since she hardly ever talks about it. The author picked a good topic for Jessi because I, for one, am tired of hearing about ballet. I'm also glad Ms. Martin didn't choose to write about the move from Oakley to Stoneybrook because she'd just stick to how her family was run down by the white neighborhood, and them being black. The author chose something special.<br />Mary Anne's chapter was also fun to read. It was a simple story, but nice. And not depressing like about her mother's death, or her father's strictness (much).<br />Mallory's entry was fun , and Claudia's was incredibly touching.<br />I recommend this book. It is wonderful and deserves five stars.	2001-07-30

His &quot;The Neighborhood&quot; and &quot;Ballard Street&quot; panels take everyday phrases and/or situations and he turns them into absurdity when combined with his detailed, exaggerated drawings. During my day-to-day activities I am constantly reminded of his cartoons and I can't say that about any other cartoonist. Jerry (along with Gary Larson) completely changed the nature of the comics because before them the drawing was secondary to the humor of the panel or strip whereas they made the picture an integral part of it. Today, there are many comic panels that are of this type, but Ballard Street is still unique.  My only criticism is that Jerry now focuses almost exclusively on dumpy old people in his panels, whereas in his old &quot;The Neighborhood&quot; panels he frequently used animals (particulary chickens which are really absurd creatures!) or inanimate objects which would seem to allow more creative possiblities. Anyway, enjoy!	2001-06-08
US	52274159	R27RY9BLIRUSCX	0304353477	548564799	Cassell Military Classics: The Berlin Raids: RAF Bomber Command Winter 1943-44	Books	4	8	13	N	N	RAF BOMBER COMMAND'S FINEST HOUR	On becoming Commander-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command in 1942, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris stated that many people were claiming that strategic aerial bombing could not win the War but his reply was that it hadn't yet been tried. The raids of the Battle of Berlin described in this book were the peak of the &quot;maximum effort&quot; to bring Germany to defeat without the need for a potentially bloody land invasion of the Nazi-occupied continent by the British and Americans. The fact that, although, the Battle of Berlin caused serious damage to the German capital, it was not decisive, did not succeed in damaging the city as did the firestorm attack on Hamburg, and caused serious losses to Bomber Command does not mean that it should not have been tried. Much of the criticism of Harris is based on 20/20 hindsight. Firstly, it is important to look at the state of the war in late 1943 and early 1944 when the Battle of Berlin was taking place. The Battle of Kursk had been fought in July and as a result, the German ability to go on the offensive on the Eastern Front had been broken, but their defensive capabilites were still formidable. It was still not at all clear that the Soviets would be able to defeat the Germans and reach Berlin nor was the outcome of the impending Operation Overlord certain. Josef Stalin was a megalomaniacal totalitarian dictator and Churchill was well aware of this fact (Roosevelt didn't seem to understand this as well). There was always the fear in the back of the mind of the British that the two dictators might just get together again as they were in 1939-1941 and reach some sort of deal. Thus, the British had to prove to the Soviets that they were making damaging attacks on Germany even thought the Western Allies didn't yet have the strength to perform a landing in France. Secondly, all the senior officers in the British armed forces remembered the disaster of the Battle of the Somme in World War I. On the FIRST DAY alone, the British lost some 60,000 casualties including 20,000 dead and the attacks failed. No one wanted a repeat of that and if there was a chance that aerial bombing could make such an attack unnecessary, it was worth it. It is true that there were serious casualties in Bomber Command, but they were getting significant successes in return for the sacrifices such as the attacks on Cologne, Hamburg and the Ruhr. Thus, it was thought that if Berlin could be devastated in the same way, perhaps the German will to fight could be broken. Middlebrook points out that the longer distance to Berlin and the physical layout of the city made it more difficult to get the same sort of results. However, the Germans were forced to make a significant investment of resources in the air defense of their capital, resources that could have been used against the Soviets or later, against the British and American forces on D-Day. The American bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs did manage to end the war with Japan without the need for a costly ground invasion of the Home Islands and many American and (possibly millions of) Japanese lives were saved as a result. Harris was hoping for the same result. The fact that he didn't have enough firepower to win the war on his own does not detract from his greatness as a commander. He worked diligently to get the necessary resources for his men and motivated them to keep flying in spite of the fact that a crewman only had about a 30% chance of surviving a tour of 30 missions. Middlebrook quotes many air crewman as pointing out that morale was high in spite of the losses because they realized they were delivering a mighty blow against one of the most evil regimes in human history. Finally, it must be pointed out that the work of Bomber Command was an investment in the future peace of the world. Both Germany and Japan were among the most militaristic societies in the world before World War II, whereas today they are among the most peaceful. This is because the people of these two nations learned the hard way that aggression does not pay. At the end of World War I there was an armistice, but there had been no fighing on German territory, so the Germans were willing to have another go at it just 20 years later. The valiant sacrifices of Bomber Command taught them that war is not the way, and the peace has held in Europe for more than 50 years.	2001-05-25

The different stores they went to, the food they ate, the sounds, the smells, the clothes she bought, her feelings while getting the haircut. I felt like I was there. After reading the other reviews that people wrote, I agreed with them about how unrealistic the girls behaivour was, but then I thought how true it is that sometimes when your friends are used to the way you are, it'll be a shock for them to see you change, especially if you're going from shy and timid to flashy. I suppose one could say I'm the first type, and I always think three times before coming to school with something new, afraid that someone might raise an eyebrow at the item, or the haircut or anything. There's no cure for these feelings, you just have to believe that if you like it, that's the only thing that matters. I know I should, anyway.	2001-03-21

For starters, why is it called 'pet sitter' if that's not even the main plot of the story? Actually, there is no plot to the story, unless you consider the club elections, which I won't. Anyway, not very exciting. Question: Why is it that the books about Mallory &amp; Jessi are less interesting than others? Do you agree?	2001-03-21

I just can't believe anyone would would want to spend their vacation watching kids... oh well. They're baby-sitters after all. I think the girls fight over dumb things, like when Coby was dancing with Kristy, and Claudia cut in. I mean, come on, grow up. Also, Dawn's fears were immensely exsagerated. It's silly for Dawn to be afraid of NY, since she's from LA and there are psychos there too. Don't be confused, this is actually a pretty good book. Enjoy!	2001-03-21

It has been stated that Churchill did not create the spirit of defiance that motivated Britain in 1940 when she stood alone against the Nazi menace but simply expressed it forcefully and eloquently. The book illustrates Churchill's genius in assuming the Prime Minister's office at the worst possible time and coping with military disaster in France where the BEF faced annihilation and serious doubts about his own leadership abilities at home, even among people in his own Conservative party. Churchill's success came from his ability to form bonds of trust with people like Chamberlain who had previously been a bitter opponent over the policy of appeasement and others like Attlee and Greenwood who were in the opposition Labor Party and also to somehow win over Halifax who wanted to negiotiate with Hitler. I learned from this book that a great leader is not an aloof figure who projects an &quot;I know it all&quot; aura, but rather one who works closely with other people, even those who oppose him, shows consideration for their feelings and also knows how to communicate with the people of his nation (who, as is shown in the book, seem to have been blissfully unware of the true dimensions of the catastrophe that was occurring on the Continent) and, at the same time, bring out their best qualities.	2001-02-09
US	52274159	R1WI8EX5COAEB6	1852330996	499217412	Exploring the Moon: The Apollo Expeditions (Springer-Praxis Series in Space Science and Technology)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A MUST FOR THOSE INTO SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION	David Harland's book is one of the finest I have ever seen on the Apollo program or on Solar System exploration in general.  Getting beyond the techincal aspects of spaceflight, the spacecraft or the astronauts' personalities which have been done by other authors, this book brings out the excitement of exploration and the discovery of the unknown that the Apollo astronauts participated in.  Many people have been exposed to a taste of this in the episode about Apollo 15 in Tom Hanks' excellent television series &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; which showed how, under excellent teachers, the astronauts, coming from a background of engineering and aeronautics, became true scientists and explorers.<br />It is true that a lot of geological concepts are thrown at the reader from the beginning and those (like myself) who have no previous background in geology might be intimidated but I find that a careful reading of the excellent glossary contained in the book should give enough background to make the science generally accessible.  Harland makes clear why the various landing sites were chosen and what the geological issues were that were to be investigated.  Traverse maps showing the various geological features to be explored are included for each mission.  The many photographs presented illustrate the main discoveries and their significance.  Of special note are the panoramas personally assembled by Harland (which are also available on the internet's Apollo Lunar Surface Journal) which give a stunning view of the Lunar environment as the astronauts saw it.<br />Finally, I strongly urge someone who finds himself becoming more interested in the subject of Lunar geology to also read Don Wilhelm's &quot;To a Rocky Moon&quot; which presents the historical development of our ideas about the Moon up through the famous Kona Conference in 1984 which determined that the Moon was probably created due to a giant body impacting with the fledgling Earth and also Paul Spudis' &quot;The Once and Future Moon&quot; which gives a summary of our state of knowledge up to the mid-1990's and directions for future exploration.	2000-12-29

These traits are illustrated well in Robert Dallek's two volume biography of Lyndon Johnson.  Fortunately, recent years have shown a more realistic view of Johnson as this complex man and not just the warmongering fiend the anti-Vietnam War people perceived more than 30 years ago.  One of the most important points that Dallek brings out is that LBJ learned lessons from Franklin Roosevelt's deceptive policies of trying to bring the US into  war with Nazi Germany, against American public opinion (which the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor ultimately proved unnecessary) and applied them to his almost surrepitious effort to engage American troops in South Vietnam.   I highly recommend these 2 books for anyone interested in American History or the study of political leadership.	2000-12-15
