On the Internet, your company, your biggest competitor, and the smallest unknown upstart competitor are the same distance from the customer. Each is only an online search away. The Internet has enabled an unprecedented increase in consumer power!&#8221; He continues, &#8220;Customer power is growing, and you must decide what to do about it! I propose that you advocate for your customers and earn their trust. In this book, I will show you why you should do this, how you can do this, and what other leading edge companies are doing in this arena. In taking my own advice and advocating for my readers, I will also explain how you can tell if trust and advocacy are not right for your company.&#8221; <br /> <br />In this context, in the chapter five, Glen Urban examines a new trust methodology based on &#8220;Theory A&#8221; (A is for Advocacy) as an answer to increasing customer power, and contrast it to &#8220;Theory P&#8221; (P is for Push/Pull marketing) as following; <br /> <br />I. Seven Rules of Theory P - Traditional Push/Pull Marketing: <br /> <br />1. Caveat emptor <br />2. Spend heavily on advertising and selling <br />3. Maximize your market position <br />4. Compete aggressively on price and offer different prices to different customers <br />5. Build quality products and provide good service <br />6. Get sales results <br />7. Measure sales and market share <br /> <br />Assumptions about customers: <br /> <br />1. Customers avoid decision-making responsibility <br />2. Customers are passive and must be coerced <br />3.Customers have difficulty learning and prefer to be influenced <br />4. Customers have little imagination <br /> <br />II. Seven Rules of Theory A: <br /> <br />1. Advocate for your customers <br />2. Invest heavily in product superiority <br />3. Create value <br />4. Work together to design products <br />5. Make fulfillment flawless <br />6. Be loyal to your customers <br />7. Measure the long-run strength of relationship with your customers <br /> <br />Assumptions about customers: <br /> <br />1. Customer decision-making is natural <br />2. Customers are active and want to control the buying process <br />3. Customers prefer to learn and make an informed decision <br />4. Customers have imagination, ingenuity, and creativity <br /> <br />In this chapter, finally, Glen Urban says that &#8220;The first question is, &#8220;What should I do about customer power?&#8221; Your answer could be push/pull marketing or customer advocacy. Your decision will depend upon the way you view your customers, so you need to ask, &#8220;What assumptions-related questions to ask are: &#8220;Do I assume that my customers are active or passive decision makers?&#8221; &#8220;Do I assume they are proactive or that they need to be coerced into buying?&#8221; Next, think about strategy and ask, &#8220;Should I base my marketing on Theory P or Theory A?&#8221; Innovative firms are beginning to operate under Theory A. Should you?&#8221; <br /> <br />I highly recommend this invaluable study.        <br />	2005-10-02

BPI asked organizations in a range of industries, sizes, and positions in the business cycle to identify their top methods of achieving strategic change and objectives. The study found that there is a strong demand, in particular, in the following areas of leadership development and organization change (leadership development, performance management, organization development and change, innovation and service enhancement, and coaching). Louis Carter, David Ulrich, and Marshall Goldsmith (editors) say that our continual research in the area of best practices in leadership development and change strongly support the assumptions and organizational case studies that we profile within this book (from Introduction).\\"   <br /> <br />Louis Carter et al. write that `'this book contains step-by-step approaches, tools, instruments, models, and practices for implementing the entire process of leadership development and change. The components of this book can be practically leveraged within your work environment to enable a leadership development or change initiative. The exhibits, forms, and instruments at the back of each chapter may be used within the classroom or by your organization development team or learners.''  <br /> <br />In this context, BSI defines a six-phase system to leadership and organization change, which may be seen in most of the case studies in this book. The phases and case studies are listed below:  <br /> <br />I- PHASES: <br /> <br />(1). Business Diagnosis, (2). Assessment, (3). Program Design, (4). Implementation, (5). On-the-Job Support, (6). Evaluation.  <br /> <br />II- CASES: <br /> <br />(1). Agilent Technologies. Inc. - Electronics with 36,000 employees. (2). Corning - Communications with 23,300 employees. (3).

In this new bottom line, the soft stuff is as important as the hard stuff because it builds customer, investor, and employee confidence about the future. Because leaders want to build confidence about the future, they need to discover a new bottom line, one focused on creating value through people and organization. When they do so, they will find that remarkable things happen. Employees are more committed, customers more satisfied, and investors are more confident...Accomplishing this purpose requires an integration of ideas from a number of different disciplines. It involves an understanding of the new role that intangibles play in company valuations and new shifts in thinking about organizational theory. It invites leaders in human resources, accounting, finance, andd information technology to consider new dimensions to their roles...The traditional viewpoint is that when a firm earns more money, its value goes up. The more it earns, the more investors value it. In recent years, however, that logic has begun to twist. Firms in the same industry and with similar earnings may have vastly different market values. This is based on the intangible value-components of a company (pp. 1-2).\\"<br />In this context, Dave Ulrich and Norm Smallwood outline a way to build an organization's intangibles by formulating an Architecture for Intangibles. \\"This architecture defines four layers of intangibles in which leaders use the ideas with great impact (p.13).\\"<br />Level 1. 'Delivers consistent and predictable earnings.' Ulrich and Smallwood say that \\"it is the most critical of all levels to achieve. Without it, there can be no success in building intangible value at any other level. You must begin there, then evaluate where you are most likely to experience success (pp. 15-16).\\" And they propose following six guidelines for delivering consistent and predictable earnings: (1). Set realistic expectations, (2). Build credibility by degrees, (3). Communicate frequently and publicly, (4). Access data frequently -know the numbers- look for early indicators, (5). Make bold decisions when necessary to adjust, (6). Legally level earnings, it possible (For details see Chapter 2).<br />Level 2. 'Articulates a future growth vision.' They say that \\"this level deals with having a strategy for future growth. Once leader meet current numbers, they are expected to have a clear strategy for growing the business in the future, in terms of both revenue and cost (p.16).\\" And they use the idea of a growth tripod to communicate three primary alternatives for growth: (1). Growth through customers- On the customer leg of the tripod, revenue growth comes from targeting customers, figuring out new channels to connect with them, building a brand that creates value, and ultimately gaining customer share of each targeted customer (Coca-Cola, Home Depot), (2). Growth through innovation- Revenue growth that comes through innovation shows up in product or service extension or creation (HP), (3). Growth through geographic expansion- Geography brings revenue growth from expanding business either within countries or in new countries (Wal-Mart, McDonald's). (For details see Chapter 3).<br />Level 3. 'Ensures future competencies aligned to strategy.' They say that \\"this level deals with core competencies of the organization. Core competencies in this case refer to the technical or functional requirements for a business to succeed...Core competence also ties to the strategic focus of a firm. Within an industry, a firm may take a strategic focus as a way to differentiate itself from its competitors. In the process, leaders can pick one of five primary strategic foci: (1). Product innovation- Invest in R&D, win new patents, and create new source of ideas (Core Competencies Required-CCR), (2). Operating efficiency- Manage productivity, improve processes, and make project choices (CCR), (3). Customer intimacy- Segment target customers, service or connect with target customer, and build enduring brand (CCR), (4). Distribution- Manage logistics, and create channels to customers (CCR), (5). Technology- Develop unique technology, apply hardware and software for success, and design product or service (CCR). (For details see Chapter 4).<br />Level 4. 'Creates capabilities.' This level deals with organization capabilities. They say that \\"organization capabilities are the things a company knows how to do well; the ability of an organization to use resources, get things done, and behave in ways that lead to accomplishment. They form the identity or personality of the fiirm, govern the way work gets done, and help executives create an organization that succeeds (pp.78-79).\\" Then, they propose seven capabilitiies that leaders use to build intangible value: (1). Talent- It represents the ability of an organization to attract, motivate, and retain the employees it need for peak performance, (2). Shared mindset/culture- When a firm has a shared mindset or culture, customers identify the firm as a brand and employees know what is expected of them, (3). Speed- Being right is not enough when being fiirst critical. Speed not only allows for first mover advantage into new markets and products, it excites and engages employees, (4). Learning- It becomes critical to an organization when it attempts to generate and generalize ideas with impact, (5). Accoutability- When organizations have individuals who are accountable for their behavior and outcomes, they have ability to execute and deliver what they propose, (6). Collaboration- It occurs when the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, (7). Quality of leadership- Effective leaders demonstrate competencies and deliver results. (For details see Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11).<br />Finally, they say that \\"leaders must define and create intangible value as well as track it, and this book helps them do so. For employees, leadership intangibles result in greater commitment, productivity, competence, job security, and personal wealth. For customers, leadership intangiibles produce products and services that meet current and future needs. For investors, leadership intangibles ensure sustained market value. Employee value often leads to customer value that leads to shareholder value (pp.250-251).\\"<br />I strongly recommend this book for all leaders who want to build confidence about the future.	2003-08-25

Contributors in this book are widely recognized as among the best in organizational change and leadership development. They provide invaluable lessons in succeeding during crisis or growth modes and economies...Within the forthcoming chapters, you will learn: <br />*Key elements of leading successful and result-driven change<br />*Tools, models, instruments, and strategies for leading change<br />*Trends and research on innovation, change and leadership<br />*Critical success factors and critical failure factors<br />*How to design, implement, and evaluate change and leadership initiatives (pp.viii-xi)\\".<br />In this context, D. Ulrich, M. Goldsmith, L. Carter, J. Bolt, and N. Smallwood (the editors) divide this invaluable book including twenty-two chapters of 'best practice' into three sections: (1). Transformational and Large Scale Change, (2). Fundamentals of Leading Change, (3). Transformational Leadership and Sustaining Results. They say, \\"we have different interests, clients, and approaches. We have each experienced successes and failures while hoping only for success. The failures were almost always failures to make correct assumptions about the fit between type of intervention, organizational system, and situation. It is these failures that help us learn; they make us humble and open our minds to different approaches...This fieldguide presents you with an array of choices for how to approach many complex situations. You will find many ideas that you can adapt to your own situation and needs. And, when you do lead change, lead with the same passion, humility, creativity, and commitment to stakeholders, customers, and excellence that have been exhibited by the change champions contributing to this book (from the Introduction).\\"<br />In the last chapter of the fieldguide, 'You Can't Be a Champion Unless You Keep Score,' John Sullivan focuses on importance of measuring results. He says that \\"If this were the Olympics, it would be obvious to all that you couldn't become a champion without measuring results. In fact, the definition of a champion is 'the one with the best results.' In the general business world the use of numbers and metrics is part of life...Within all major firms all projects, products, and business units are evaluated on the basis of numerical results. However, in direct contrast, we within HR resist using metrics, almost like developing them was the equivalent of a root canal...The Watson Wyatt Human Capital Index study demonstrated that the potential impact of people programs on a firm's overall market value could be as high as 47 percent. The road is clear and the time is right. HR must now seize this unprecedented opportunity to adopt metrics and to become the next 'corporate hero' (pp.279-283)\\" <br />Therefore, after saying \\"metrics are the fastest and the cheapest way to change behavior in business,\\" he demonstrates:<br />I.Nine reasons to utilize metrics: (1). Meeting your goals, (2). Driving improvement, (3). Obtain funding, (4). Early warning a.k.a 'smoke detectors,' (5). Understanding critical success factors, (6). Shift to fact-based decisions, (7). Metrics change behaviors, (8). Eliminate confusion, (9). Builds coordination/cooperation.<br />II.Eight steps in developing metrics: (1). Select a metric for each program goal, (2). Choosing between soft and hard metrics, (3). Understanding the different categories of business impact, (4). Selecting simple but attention-getting metrics, (5). Understanding the characteristics of great measures, (6). Selecting from standard HR metrics, (7). Selecting from advanced metrics, (8). Building the business case forincreased HR funding.<br />III.Eleven decision factors for approving HR projects: (1). A low initial investment, (2). The project has a high ROI, (3). Similar projects implemented elsewhere have a high success rate or a low risk of failure, (4). The project starts right away without a long delay, (5). There is a short payback period, (6). The project has a complete set of accurate results metrics and a method for collecting metric information, (7). No new headcount is required, (8). The project has negative consequences for failure built in, (9). The program gives us a competitive advantage over other firms, (10). The program can demonstrate that it increases worker productivity, (11). A project team is credible and has high success rate on previous projects.<br />Finally, Sullivan writes, \\"HR professionals understand that the world of business has recently lost its tolerance for decisions made without facts and for programs that don't produce measurable results...Metrics can provide you with the opportunity to be superior performer by letting you know unambiguously where you are and how far you have to go. Your future path is clear; you can't become a champion...without measuring your results (pp.297-298).\\"<br />I highly recommend this invaluable fieldguide to all change champions of the future.	2003-07-21

As written by S.Chowdhury, &quot;the book you are reading reveals the collective thoughts and visions of some of the world's great minds...Management 21C brings together visions for the new millennium in one concise book, allowing you to understand the changes happening now and what changes you can expect. The future of business will be different : whose versions are you reading?...Management 21C is for those who believe in creative war, for those who inspire other people, for those who believe in others and not just themselves, for those who celebrate diversity, for those who constantly search for a dream, for those who want to reshape the world of tomorrow. Someday we'll all manage this way (from the Preface p.xiii).&quot; <br />In this context, for instance : <br />* J.M.Kouzes and B.Z.Posner introduce &quot;The Janusian Leader&quot;-the leader with the capacity to look forward and back, to preside over endings and beginnings, sunsets and daybreaks. They also present seven key lessons that stand the test of time and are worthy of being carried with us from one millennium to another (see pp.17-32). <br />* S.Ghoshal, C.A.Bartlett and P.Moran suggest : &quot;When the solution to a recurring problem is always 'Try harder', there is usually something wrong with the terms, not the execution. So it is time for both managers and management academics to throw out the old paradigm and to start experimenting with new, more fertile possibilities (see pp.121-140).&quot; <br />* C.K.Prahalad argues : &quot;In the new millennium, the methods and skills needed to manage large and small organizations will be different from those needed to be successful during the past three decades. Newer concepts and tools will emerge.&quot; He then discusses the emerging nature of managerial work and suggests that this transformation of managerial work will demand basic organizational innovations (see pp.141-150). <br />* P.M.Sengeand K.H.Kaufer write : &quot;Faced with profoundly new business realities-unprecedented demands from global competition, new technologies, emerging markets, possible mergers and alliances, and growing environmental pressures-many companies are falling back on old leadership habits...Rather than making executives less important, we argue that understanding leadership communities brings the unique roles of executive leaders into much clearer relief, as it does the roles for other types of leaders- all of whom will ultimately depend upon one another in creating successful 21st century enterprises (see pp.186-204).&quot; <br />* D.Ulrich suggests : &quot;Since the future is unpredictable but coming anyway, we need to prepare as best we can by projecting about context, organization and people.&quot; He then gives his observations about the contextual factors impacting on organizations, how organizations will operate, and how individuals must prepare themselves today to respond tomorrow (see pp.235-249). <br />* R.Moss Kanter argues : &quot;Brainpower is to the global information economy as oil was to the industrial economy...Business leaders increasingly understand that one of their new roles in the 21st century is to contribute to creating such environments in the communities in which their companies operate. World-class leaders will be cosmopolitans who avoid insularity, enjoy the challenge of confronting new and different ideas, encourage cross-fertilization and learning across boundaries, and support their people in developing and using their brainpower in pursuit of innovation (see pp.250-261).&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-25

It gives a clear, concise road map to have a highly productive and motivated workforce.<br />Greg Blencoe divides his book into eight main parts to discuss eight important issues within a related chapter. He also summarizes these issues end of each chapter as following:<br />1. Surround yourself with high quality employees: Just as a chef needs high quality ingredients to make a great meal, a manager needs high quality employees to give customers a great product. Who do you have around you?<BR> <BR>2. Replace unproductive employees: Remove unproductive employees from your organization or they will be the seed of your destruction.<br />3. Understand that all motivation stems from self-interest: Employees are motivated by: <br />- Money;<BR> <BR>-Being part of a high quality organization;<br />- Establishing their individual importance and receiving respect from others within the organization;<br />- Doing enjoyable and fulfilling work.<br />4. Tell employees what you expect of them, then don't micromanage: Let employees know what needs to be done and then get out of their way. Don't be a micromanager unless you want microprofits.<BR> <BR>5. Give praise instead of criticism: Praise is like putting water on a plant. Criticism is like putting acid on a plant. Will your employee morale and motivation blossom or wilt?<br />6. Issue instructions in a respectful manner: Employees will be much more motivated if tasks are assigned in a respectful manner. Got it, drill sergeant?<br />7. Listen to employees: Right now, each one of your employees is probably unhappy about something regarding work and has ideas about how to improve the business. Go listen to them.<br />8. Implement a profit sharing program: If you want your employees to think and act like entrepreneurs, implement a profit sharing program.<br />Finally, as conclusion, he says that &quot;What should you do now? Quite simply, you should put theseideas into practice. Since you likely have a manager yourself, however, there will be times when you will not have the power to do everything you want. For example, your manager may not allow you to hire who you want if the prospective employee demands a high salary. Even though you may be right to want to spend more on your top candidate, you will have to settle for somebody else. When your choices are limited, just do the best you can with the resources you've been given. That's all you can ever ask of yourself&quot; (pp.107-108).<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-02

These accounting views are useful in the production of general ledgers and other high-level accounting snapshots of the enterprise, but they usually bear little relationship to the dynamic way project-focused organizations are structured and continually restructured around new projects...Regardless of the acronym used, whether it is PSA (Professional Service Automation), SPO (Service Process Optimization), SRM (Service Relationship Management), or any other variation, they all refer to the same thing. Their ultimate goal is also the same: Maximize the performance of white collar project-and-service oriented organizations (PSORGs) ant their staff...These solutions automate and integrate core business processes with the intent of increasing the efficieny of how projects are planned, budgeted, created, staffed, scheduled, implemented, and billed in the real world...Very few PSORGs efficiently deliver their projects or services. Due to increased industry complexities and inefficiient corporate processes, service workers are not focusing on their key responsibilities. Instead, they are being bombarded with increasing numbers of administrative tasks, technology issues, unmanageable workloads, and either a lack of useful information or an inundation of useless detail (or both). There is a great need and an increasing demand for software applications to make PSORGs more productive and more profitable. PSA applications, or the many other similar acronyms, descriibe a set of software solutions that have been designed to achieve such a goal&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, Rudolf Melik et. al. define this invaluable book's goal is to assist the reader in identifying the key concepts of PSA solutions, their principle features, criteria for selecting them, and their implementation requirements. According to them, PSA functionality can be divided into following multiple core components and extended components:<br />I. Core Components:<br />* Performance analysis: Executive reporting, OLAP-based multidimensional data analysis, ROI, and decision support. Quick and customizable home, portal, and dashboard views and peer reviews.<br />* Operations: Organization breakdown structure (OBS) management, site management, scoping, business rules, component-based security profiles, access rights, audit trails, general ledgers, and terminology settings.<br />* Resource management: Skills and expertise assessment and matching. Resource allocation, search, scheduling, leveling, forecasting, and availability.<br />* Project management: Work breakdown structure (WBS) and engagement tracking. Multiple levels for budgeting amounts, duration, schemes, thresholds, and estimate to complete (ETC). Project scheduling, quality control, and R&amp;D claim management. Seamless integration with major project management applications.<br />* Revenue &amp; cost accounting: Cost and billing rate engine, support for dependencies, history, custom rules, fixed, hourly, daily, custom, WBS, and split billing settings. Multicurrency support, tax category and jurisdictions, Invoicing and payroll wizards and payment processing.<br />* Timesheet management: Timesheet submission, validation, and approval, compliance reporting, supervisory controls, automatic approval, notes, document attachments, and work assignment.

Extended Components:<br />* Customer and partner relationship management (CRM and PRM): Some PSA solutions include CRM and PRM functionality. CRM includes customer self-services, contact management, marketing campaigns, and a more sophisticated demand management system. PRM automates the workflows and processes of finding, training, and managing partners.<br />* Human resource management (HR): HR systems process the staff requisition, purchasing, and recruitment process.<br />* Complete enterprise accounting: Invoices, accounts payable/receivable, revenue recognition, and other such information generated by a PSA solution is exchanged with the organization's accounting system.<br />Finally, they write that &quot;PSA is the first class of software that provides a comprehensive end-to-end solution that uniquely addresses the needs and problems of PSORGs. This class of software solutions is rapidly evolving into the ERP for white collar project- or service-driven organizations...Every PSA solution has its unique set of strengths and limitations. Determining which areas are important to your business is the key to selecting the most effective solution. PSA isno longer a way to have software or a means to gain competitive advantage; PSA is rapidly becoming a must-have tool for project and service oriented organizations&quot; (pp.339-341).<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-02

Perhaps they offer helpful insight into your growing model of successful leadership. But day to day, despite your best efforts, such reading and contemplation are often difficult to apply to emerging situations that demand that you act as a leader. This toolkit is designed to close that gap, to provide practical advice, ideas, behaviors, assesments, skill-building activities, and methods for leading yourself and others in your daily work...If you are using this book as a development path-to build your leadership competencies-it moves concentrically from leading yourself, to individuals and teams, to whole organization. We believe an emerging leader must first develop self-awareness and personal commitment before he or she can effectively lead others. And you must be able to garner committed action from individual colleagues, employees, and your boss before you can effectively lead them collectively&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, L.Carter, D.Davidson, J.Lehrich, and R.Waks (editors) divide this seminal toolkit into four major sections. As said by editors, these major sections are further divided into topical subsections. Each brief 'topic' reading is intended to provide context, background, and insight for the 'tool' that follows. Many tools are then followed by an application exercise that encourages you to 'try it out' in specific leadership situations.<br />I- Leading Self: &quot;Leader,&quot; editors say, &quot;know thyself. True leadership-leading individuals, teams, and organizations alike-comes from within, from the manager who draws from the wellspring of his own character. To trust others, trust yourself; to inspire others, find inspiration in who you are.&quot; Thus, in this section writers present tools to evaluate yourself: both your leadership behaviors (the Leadership Assessment Instrument) and your emotional intelligence.<br />II- Leading Individuals: &quot;Leaders achieve results through others.&quot; Editors say, &quot;As a leader, you owe it to your organization and to yourself-not to mention to your employees-to take responsibility for those you manage. How you treat and serve the individuals you lead will determine what you achieve, what you are accountable for, and what role you play in the future of others. With power comes obligation, and a leader accepts sober responsibility along with the power to hire, fire, and inspire. Such responsibility need not rely solely on intuition and hard-won experience.&quot; Then, in this section book gives you some ready resources like interviewing, delegation, performance coaching, managing challenging conversation, and building trusting relationship for the fundamental duties of a leader and manager.<br />III- Leading Teams: &quot;Virtually all organizational work today is done in teams: project teams and quality teams, ongoing work teams and cross-functional improvement teams, virtual teams, problem-solving teams, and more.&quot; Editors write, &quot;Individuals work interdependently on shared projects and toward a common purpose, often on more than one team at once. And for the individuals to succeed, for the groups to achieve its objectives with minimal rancor and recriminution, the team needs effective leadership. As leader you have the opportunity to watch and guide a team throughout its life cycle, from origin to deliverables, cradle to grave.&quot; Thus, in this section writers present the steps of that cycle to simplify your leadership responsibilities for choosing the team members, clarifying the group's objectives and its members' roles, facilitating effective team meetings, assessing and developing the team's processes, capabilities, and decision-making, reducing or forestalling conflict, and conducting team project reviews.<br />IV- Leading Organizations- &quot;You may know yourselfas a leader-your tendencies, your behavior, your principles and practices.&quot; Editors say, &quot;You may serve as guide and inspiration for individuals, and as driving force or unseen hand for high-performing teams. But do you lead your organization? Are you an architect, change champion, teacher, and communicator on whom your company or institution can depend? An organizational leadership role demands foresight, reflection, and planning-very skills that are strongest when assisted by tools.&quot; In this section writers present techniques, devices, and systems to leading organizations.<br />Finally, L.Carter, D.Davidson, J.Lehrich, and R.Waks (editors) say that &quot;Yet this single volume is not intended to be a comprehensive compendium of all the tools we could find or develop. That would be impractical and self-defeating. Instead it is meant to give you, the emerging and working organizational leader, a sampling of the range of tools needed to effectively manage the present and lead toward the future, and to apply them to the broadest span of situations you encounter.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2002-07-01

Through a case study approach, this book provides practical, easy-to-apply tools, instruments, training, concepts, and competency models that can be used as benchmarks for the successful implementation of your specific OD/HRD initiative (from the Introduction).&quot;<br />In this context, Louis Carter, David Giber, and Marshall Goldsmith (editors) divide core part of this book -Organization and Human Resources Development Case Studies- into following five OD/HRD topic areas: <br />I. Organization Development and Change: In this section, W. Warner Burke says, &quot;Seven rich cases (Kraft Foods, Nortel, ServiceMASTER, SmithKline Beecham, Westinghouse, CK Witko, and Xerox) of organization development and change are discussed...The cases cover a wide range of change from how OD occurs every day to deep change in an organization's culture...Without doubt we can learn from these cases. And learn we must. Changing organization is too intricate to be left to novices. We have indeed learned and noted at the outset, but we still have much to learn. As one who has been involved for more than 35 years, helping organizations change is both thrilling and very satisfying. Learning, however, is the most exciting part (pp.6-8).&quot;<br />II. Leadership Development: In this section, Jay A. Congerwrites that &quot;In the cases that follow, we look at three companies (Boeing, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Sun Microsystems,Inc.) that have dedicated serious time and resources to leadership development...In addition, all three of the company cases make extended use of competency models, 360-degree feedback, and action learning (p.186).&quot;<br />III. Recruitment and Retention: In this section of the book, John Sullivan writes, &quot;you'll learn how three diverse companies tackled their retention and recruiting problems. Two of the firms are high tech (AMD and Cellular One), while another (Allstate) is in a more traditional industry. Both AMD and Cellular One focus on solving the hot issue of retention while Allstate takes a new look at the recruiting and selection processes. All three of the case studies use a scientific approach to identify which solutions have the most impact...All three of these case studies are worth examining because of their scientific methodology as well as their results. All are full of powerfull 'lessons learned' for those who are soon to begin a major recruitment or retention effort (pp.303-304).&quot;<br />IV. Performance Management: This section examines performance management systems of Case Corporation and Sonoco. Edward E. Lawler III says that &quot;the performance management systems in most organizations are contoversial, ineffective, and constantly under construction. They are so problematic that critics argue many organizations would be better off if they simply didn't have a performance management system, particularly one in which performance appraisals are tied to pay actions. But-and it is an important but- if individuals are not appraised, counseled, coached, and rewarded for performance, how can an organization pruduce the organized, coordinated, and motivated behavior that it takes to perform well? The answer most likely is that it can't (p.393).&quot;<br />V. Coaching and Mentoring: Introduction of this section, Beverly Kaye writes, &quot;the last 5 years have seen a groundswell in both arenas. And it's not just been more of the same; organizations have begun to use mentoring and coaching more purposefully. HR and OD practitioners have worked to utilize both interventions to meet pressing business problems having to do with the development and retention of talent, as well as the growth of future leaders. These interventions have been more systemic, more thoughtful, and more innovative than ever before.The case studies (Dow Corning, and MediaOne Group-AT&amp;T) illustrate this trend. Both were motivated by specific business drivers, both were preceded by intensive research, both were implemented over time, and both were evaluated seriously. Readers will find them instructive, detailed, and engaging (p.438).&quot;<br />Finally, Louis Carter (editor) says that &quot;contributors were asked to indicate where they envision their organization is heading with its initiative within the next 5 to 10 years. Responses indicate that the contributors want to keep the organization on a track to continuously learn and develop its capabilities. Comments from some contributors indicate that they want to leverage lessons learned from this experience. Some contributors commented that they want to firmly ingrain the initiative into the organization to the point that it is almost invisible to the user, making it an accepted part of life at the company. Other contributors will continue to refine the present initiative in place, while others will expand their efforts into other business lines. Survey results clearly indicate that the present state of the initiatives represented in this book represent snapshots of moving targets. Further growth and innovation is inevitable for these best practice organizations, as they work to stay ahead of their competitors by embracing change and continuously learning and improving (pp.531-532).&quot;<br />Strongly recommended.	2002-05-20

It's designed to help you reflect and act on your need (or organization's) for change...When we began our research, we decided to find out what practices characterize exemplary leaders: people who get extraordinary things done in organizations. Our research began with analyzing what behaviors people demonstrated when they were leading a project that they considered a 'personal best': one that set an individual standard of excellence for them. We collected thousands of stories of leaders performing at their peak, and we looked at what actions seemed to be consistent in all the stories. Several years-and several thousand quantitative and qualitative analyses-later, we found that five practices define exemplary leadership: 1.Challenging the process 2.Inspiring a shared vision 3.Enabling others to act 4.Modeling the way 5.Encouraging the heart...The purpose of this planner is to assist people, managers and nonmanagers alike, in furthering their ability to lead others and get extraordinary things done...We hope that his planner convinces you that leadership is everyone's business...By accepting the challenge to lead, you come to realize that the only limits are those you place on yourself&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, throughout the five chapters (3 through 7), James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner list and explain guidelines for these five practices.<br />1. Guidelines for Challenging the Process- Try these strategies to change, grow, innovate, and improve: *treat every job as an adventure *send people shopping for ideas *put 'idea gathering' on your own agenda *go out and find something that needs fixing *take a class; learn a new skill *experiment, experiment, experiment *make it safe for others to experiment *work with ideas that may sound strange initially *debrief every failure as well as every success *model risk taking.<br />2. Guidelines for Inspiring a Shared Vision- Try hese strategies to envision an uplifting future and enlist others in the vision: *determine what you want *act on your intuition *test your assumptions *become a futurist *develop your interpersonal competence *breathe life into your vision *speak positively *speak from the heart *make the intangible tangible *listen, listen, listen.<br />3. Guidelines for Enabling Others to Act- Try these strategies to build trust and strengthen others: *always say we *increase interactions *focus on gains, not losses *from planning and problem-solving partnership *go first *enlarge people's sphere of influence *make sure delegated tasks are relevant *make connections *make heroes of other people *educate, educate, educate.<br />4. Guidelines for Modeling the Way- Try these strategies to set the example and achieve small wins: *open a dialoque about personal and shared values *audit your actions *be dramatic *tell stories about teacheble moments *take personal interest in everything *make a plan *create a model *break it up, and break it down *ask for volunteers *sell the benefits, benefits, benefits.<br />5. Guidelines for Encouraging the Heart- Try these strategies to recognize individual contributions and celebrate team accomplishments: *seek out people who are doing things right *personalize and publicize each recognition *link the recognition to a clear set of standards *celebrate individual recognition in a group *be creative about rewards and recognition *give recognition and rewards *tell the story of someone who exemplifies the standards you set *design the reward-and-recognition system participatively *provide feedback en route *schedule celebrations *be a cheer leader, in your own preferred way *stay in love with what you do *have fun, laugh, enjoy.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-12-25

They are increasingly discovering that the coordination of the marketing, engineering, manufacturing, distribution, and sales groups will require more than goodwill, good intentions, and a few management incentives. To achieve the necessary integration requires understanding the subcultures of each of these functions and the design of intergroup processes that allow communication and collaboration across sometimes strong subcultural boundaries...Cultural analysis is necessary if we are to understand how new technologies influence and are influenced by organizations. A new technology is usually a reflection of an occupational culture that is built around new core scientific or engineering concepts and tools...Cultural analysis is necessary for management across national and ethnic boundaries...Organizational learning, development, and planned change cannot be understood without considering culture as a primary source of resistance to change...Given these and related issues, it seems obvious that we must increase our study of culture and put this research on a solid conceptual foundation. Superficial concepts of culture will not be useful; we must come to understand fully what culture is all about in human groups, organizations, and nations so that we can have a much deeper understanding of what goes on, why it goes on, and what, if anything, we can do about it&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, Edgar H. Schein organizes his book into six parts.<br />* Part One- In this section, after saying that cultural understanding is desirable for all of us, but it is essential to leaders if they are to lead, he defines the concept of culture and shows its relationship to leadership.<br />* Part Two- In this section he focuses more on the concept of culture and the less on the concept of leadership. He argues that the content of organizational cultures reflects the ultimate problems that every group faces: dealing with its external environment and managing its internal integration. According to him beyond these external and internal problems, cultural assumptions reflect deeper issues about the nature of truth, time, space, human nature, and human relationships.<br />* Part Three- In this section he deals with the practical issues of how one can decipher cultural assumptions. He says that the reader will note that the emphasis in this part is practical and oriented toward what leaders, researchers, and consultants can actually do about deciphering culture.<br />* Part Four- In this section he focuses on leadership, especially the role that leadership plays in creating and embedding culture in a group. He argues that leaders create culture and must manage and sometimes change culture.<br />* Part Five- The focus of Schein in this section, as well as those in the rest of the book, remains on the leader and how culture change appears from the leader's perspective.<br />* Part Six- In this section his focus shifts from analysis to normative speculation. He deals with the concept of learning and the implications for leadership and culture of the growing rate of change.<br />I highly recommend this business classic on organizational culture and leadership.	2001-12-25

Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner write, &quot;We've designed it to describe what leaders do, explain the fundamental principles that support these leadership practices, provide actual case examples of real people who demonstrate each practice, and offer specific recommendations on what you can do to make these practices your own and to continue your development as a leader...As we looked deeper into the dynamic process of leadership, through case analyses and survey questionnaires, we uncovered five fundamental practices that enable leaders to get extraordinary things done. The individual stories of how ordinary people got extraordinary things done brought the leadership model to life for us, giving it character and color. When they were at their personal best, the leaders we studied were able to challenge the process, inspire a shared vision, enable others to act, model the way, ana encourage the heart. These practices aren't the private property of the people we studied or of a few select shining stars. They've stood the test of time, and they're available to anyone, in any organization or situation, who accepts the leadership challenge.&quot;<br />In this context, Kouzes and Posner say that embedded in the five fundamental practices of exemplary leadership are beheviors that can serve as the basis of learning to lead. And they call these behaviors as the Ten Commitments of Leadership. According to them these ten commitments serve as the guide for their discussion of how leaders get extraordinary things done in organizations and as the structure for what's to follow. Each of these commitments are fully explored in Chapters 3 through 12.<br />Practice I- Challenging the Process<br />Commitment 1. Search out challenging opportunities to change, grow, innovate and improve.<br />Commitment 2. Experiment, take risks, and learn from the accompanying mistakes.<br />Practice II- Inspiring a Shared Vision<br />Commitment 3. Envision an uplifting and ennobling future.<br />Commitment 4. Enlist others in a common vision by appealing to their values, interests, hopes, and dreams.<br />Practice III- Enabling Others to Act<br />Commitment 5. Foster collaboration by promoting cooperative goals and building trust.<br />Commitment 6. Strengthen people by giving power away, providing choice, developing competence, assigning critical tasks, and offering visible support.<br />Practice IV- Modeling the Way<br />Commitment 7. Set the example by behaving in ways that are consistent with shared values.<br />Commitment 8. Achieve small wins that promote consistent progress and build commitment.<br />Practice V- Encouraging the Heart<br />Commitment 9.

His observations on the spectacular comet that now bears his name helped earn him the prestigious title of Astronomer Royal.More important to this professional scientist was the fact that this fortuitous opportunity inspired a flurry of other research activity that led to new and important discoveries about the nature of our universe.&quot; Sumantra Ghoshal and Christopher A. Bartlett write, &quot;While hardly on the same grand scale as Sir Edmund, we, too, have been fortunate to have had a front-row seat at a once-in-a-lifetime event- the collapse of an outmoded corporate form and the emergence of a new management model that we believe will propel today's companies well into the twenty-first century. At the heart of the emerging model lie not only some very different organizational practices and processes but also a fundamentally different management philosophy. In this book, we describe this new management model and illustrate how some of the pioneers of this new approach have implemented it in their companies&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />They divide their book into four parts. In the first part, they present the concept of the Individualized Corporation. In the second part, they describe the organizational characteristics required to develop three core capabilities that distinguish the Individualized Corporation. In the third part, they explore the managerial implications of these new organizational characteristics and focus on how companies can go about building and managing the Individualized Corporation. Finally, in the fourth part, they step back from the details of defining the characteristics of the Individualized Corporation and describing how to build and manage it, to examine the more profound issues of a new managerial philosophy that underlies this new corporate model.<br />In this context, in the third part, after introducing the new corporate model, they examine new management roles and tasks of this new model that are radically different from the classic ones:<br />1. Operating-Level Managers<br />* Changing role: From operational implementers to aggressive entrepreneurs.<br />* Primary value added: Driving business performance by focusing on productivity, innovation, and growth within frontline units.<br />* Key activities and tasks: Creating and pursuing new growth opportunities for the business. Attracting and developing resources and competencies. Managing continuous performance improvement within the unit.<br />2. Senior-Level Managers<br />* Changing role: From administrative controllers to supportive coaches.<br />* Primary value added: Providing the support and coordination to bring large-company advantage to the independent frontline units.<br />* Key activities and tasks: Developing individuals and supporting their activities. Linking dispersed knowledge, skills, and best practices across units. Managing the tension between short-term performance and long-term ambition.<br />3. Top-Level Managers<br />* Changing role: From resource allocators to institutional leaders.<br />* Primary value added: Creating and embedding a sense of direction, commitment, and challenge to people throughout the organization.<br />* Key activities and tasks: Challenging embedded assumptions while establishing a stretching opportunity horizon and performance standards. Institutionalizing a set of norms and values to support cooperation and trust. Creating an overarching corporate purpose and ambition.<br />Finally, they say that &quot;Halley's comet will return to our corner of the solar system in the year 2062. When it does, we believe our successors will look back at the Individualized Corporation as the revolutionary new model that brought business organizations into the postindustrial, information-intensive age of knowledge.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.new corporate model, they examine new management roles and tasks of this new model that are radically different from the classic ones:<br />1.

Several years ago, however, the great disparity between the track records of the corporate winners and losers prompted me to step back and specifically tackle the broader question: Why do some companies succeed while others fail? The answer I have come up with is that winning companies win because they have good leaders who nurture the development of other leaders at all levels of the organization. The ultimate test of success for an organization is not whether it can win today but whether it can keep winning tomorrow and the day after. Therefore, the ultimate test for a leader is not whether he or she makes smart decisions and takes decisive action, but whether he or she teaches others to be leaders and builds an organization that can sustain its success even when he or she is not around. The key ability of winning organizations and winning leaders is creating leaders&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, Noel Tichy divides his book into ten chapters. After defining what he means by 'winning' in Chapter 1, in the rest of the book, he talks specifically about what winning leaders do that makes them winners and how they develop other winning leaders at all levels of their organizations. In order to help reader, he emphasizes following 30 main themes that emerged in the book:<br />* Winning is about leadership,<br />* Leaders have ideas, values, energy and edge,<br />* Without leaders, organizations stagnate,<br />* Leaders manage through times of change,<br />* Leaders make things happen,<br />* Leaders are revolutionaries,<br />* Great leaders are great teachers,<br />* Winning leaders make teaching a personal priority,<br />* Winners have a 'teachable point of view,'<br />* Winning leaders draw from their past,<br />* Leaders' stories reveal their teachable points of view,<br />* Everyone has a usable past: Leaders just use theirs better,<br />* Winning organizations are built on clear ideas,<br />* Leaders make sure the ideas are current and appropriate,<br />* Ideas are the framework for actions at all levels,<br />* Winning organizations have strong values,<br />* Winning leaders live the values-privately and publicly,<br />* Values are a key competitive tool,<br />* Winning leaders are high-energy people,<br />* Winning leaders create energy in others,<br />* Times of transition: Teachable moments,<br />* Winning leaders never take the easy way out,<br />* Categories of edge,<br />* Edge isn't cruel, it's honest,<br />* Winning leaders portray the future as an unfolding drama,<br />* Winners' stories create scenarios for success,<br />* Leaders' stories are dynamic and motivating,<br />* Winning leadership is about building for the future,<br />* Success is achieved by developing other leaders,<br />* The best leaders know when it's time to leave.<br />Finally, he says that &quot;Organizations that have a Leadership Engine win because they have leaders at every level who teach others to be leaders. Teaching and learning are at the heart of these organizations.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-10-22

It is not part of my argument to suggest that no organizations have a business driven approach to HRM, and if this were the case I should feel confident in my own advice, and would be able to offer no positive case studies&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, in his book, D.E.Hussey:<br />* explores practical approaches with case studies and examples that will enable an organization to apply a business driven approach to HRM.<br />* refutes the following myths about HRM:<br />- If the top HR manager is on the Board, this is enough to ensure that HRM is business driven.<br />- If HRM is allowed to be proactive when new corporate strategies are considered, this automatically means that all HRM activities will become business driven.<br />- Doing things right automatically meams that we are doing the right things: therefore it is enough to apply good professional practice.<br />- Because new HR policies and procedures take a lot of time and effort to implement, they will have a long shelf life.<br />- Evaluation and performance measures are too difficult and expensive for HRM activities, and HRM does not need to be subject to such disciplines.<br />- In any case it is not possible to evaluate the results of many HRM actions which should be treated as acts of faith.<br />- Every action we take in HRM is with a concern for the interest of the organization, which means that we are business driven.<br />- Line management know that HRM is a valuable, value adding strategic partner which plays an irreplaceable role in the management of the organization.<br />Finally, he says that &quot;I hope that the book will play a part in helping HRM to be a major force in organizational success. At the least, I hope it will make a contribution to thinking that will encourage others to work on the issue.

It is not part of my argument to suggest that no organizations have a business driven approach to HRM, and if this were the case I should feel confident in my own advice, and would be able to offer no positive case studies&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this case, in his book, D.E.Hussey:<br />* explores practical approaches with case studies and examples that will enable an organization to apply a business driven approach to HRM.<br />* refutes the following myths about HRM:<br />- If the top HR manager is on the Board, this is enough to ensure that HRM is business driven.<br />- If HRM is allowed to be proactive when new corporate strategies are considered, this automatically means that all HRM activities will become business driven.<br />- Doing things right automatically meams that we are doing the right things: thereforeit is enough to apply good professional practice.<br />- Because new HR policies and procedures take a lot of time and effort to implement, they will have a long shelf life.<br />- Evaluation and performance measures are too difficult and expensive for HRM activities, and HRM does not need to be subject to such disciplines.<br />- In any case it is not possible to evaluate the results of many HRM actions which should be treated as acts of faith.<br />- Every action we take in HRM is with a concern for the interest of the organization, which means that we are business driven.<br />- Line management know that HRM is a valuable, value adding strategic partner which plays an irreplaceable role in the management of the organization.<br />Finally, he says that &quot;I hope that the book will play a part in helping HRM to be a major force in organizational success. At the least, I hope it will make a contribution to thinking that will encourage others to work on the issue. It will be even better if it helps your organization to develop a business driven approach.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-10-10

Discussions often seek answers to (some) questions...In many ways, these are not new questions. The difference today lies in the approach taken to answer them: Increasingly, the spotlight is falling on human resource issues. To answer these questions, line managers and HR professionals must rethink and redefine human resources...HR professionals have responded to this increased scrutiny with a major shift in thinking from their previous focus on 'doables' to a new, more proactive focus on 'deliverables.' Doables focus on improving HR practices, upgrading HR professionals, and reengineering HR departments. Doables emphasize actions, activities, and what happens. Deliverables refocus attention on outcomes, results, and value created from doing HR work.&quot;<br />In this context, Dave Ulrich says that while few disagree that HR practices, professionals, and departments should refocus on deliverables or results, discussions have just begun as to what constitutes HR results. And, according to him, emerging questions for HR include the following:<br />1. What are HR results?<br />* HR results as firm performance<br />* HR results as capabilities<br />2. What capabilities may be defined as HR results?<br />* Creating strategic clarity: be a strategic partner<br />* Making change happen: be a change agent<br />* Creating intellectual capital: be an employee champion<br />3. How does a results focus shift HR responsibility, practices, departments, and professionals?<br />Finally, he says that this antology provides readers with a clear point of view on HR results and offers specific definitions and examples of those results.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-10-01

This linkage will help organizations better communicate to associates about how they can effectively guide their own actions...The book is written for human resource professionals, who strive to link their organization's core competencies, capabilities, values, and priorities to its human resource applications...You can expect this book to recognize and reinforce important distinctions between an organization's strategic core competencies and its individual competencies and skills. Although these distinctions are obvious to business strategists, they are a source of confusion for many in human resources who want to use competencies to reflect vision, culture, and values&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, Paul C. Green divides his book into two main parts:<br />I. Clarifying Competencies: In this part;<br />* He argues that &quot;robust competencies help you define what was done, what is being done, and what needs to be done.&quot; And hence, he sets the stage for building robust competencies by identifying the ambiguities, challenges, and rewards of using competencies.<br />* He explores the different meanings of competencies that are used in organizations and research. And he argues that &quot;HR competency system must be job related and should reflect core competencies, capabilities, core values, and priorities.&quot;<br />* He discusses operationalizing performance skills to enable you to use behavioral observation, description, and inference to communicate clearly what a person needs to do to do a job well. Here he says that &quot;a behavior is an action that you can observe, describe, and verify.&quot;<br />* He explores how the identity of an organization can become the target for alignment, and discusses how an organization's identity can be reflected in and reinforced by interviews, appraisal, coaching, and training.<br />II. Linking Competencies to Human Resource Systems: In this part, after briefly discussing perception-driven, experience-driven, attribute-driven, and behavior-driven approaches, he offers behavioral approach to link interviews, appraisals, coaching, and training to the identity of an organization. It emphasizes a systemic, job-related approach to support the effectiveness and defensibility of an HR system. He argues that &quot;the linkage of HR applications is easier when the organization consistently uses a behavioral approach. Once behavioral language is used in one part of an HR system, it can be expanded to other applications.&quot;<br />Finally, he says that &quot;the best answers to questions about core competencies, capabilities, core values, and priorities come from real experiences in applying them. Today, each answer is just an opinion at one point in time. However, the big question for the future will be: How can I link HR systems to my organization's identity? At present the most useful answers are those that emphasize a behavioral approach, job relatedness, nimbleness, and open mindedness.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-09-11

The problem is that they don't know what to do about it. We believe that this potential cannot be realized until people recognize where it actually lies. Consider this. Most creative acts, as they now occur in companies, are not planned for and come from where they are least expected. It is impossible to predict 'what' they will be, 'who' will be involved in them, and 'when' and 'how' they will happen. This is the true nature of corporate creativity, and it is here that a company's creative potential really lies. For corporate creativity, the real power is in the unexpected&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, in describing the corporate creativity, Alan G. Robinson and Sam Stern write that a company is creative when its employees do something new and potentially useful without being directly shown and taught. And they argue that in every unexpected creative act the following six essential elements are key to promoting consistent corporate creativity:<br />1. 'Alignment' is the degree to which the interests and actions of every employee support the organization's key goals. Strong alignment requires three things: *clarity about what the key goals of the organization are, *commitment to initiatives that promote the key goals, *accountability for actions that affect the key goals.<br />2. 'Self-initiated activity.' The majority of creative acts in companies are self-initiated, which explains why they are unanticipated by management. To promote it, companies only have to unleash what is already present. The key is an effective system for responding to employee ideas, which must have five characteristics. The system must: *reach everyone, *be easy to use, *have strong follow-through, *document ideas, *be based on intrinsic motivation.<br />3. 'Unofficial activity,' work done without direct official support, is what makes it possible for a companyto go where it never expected to. Every unexpected creative act begins with a period of unofficial activity, which might be a matter of minutes or years.<br />4. 'Serendipity' combines a fortunate accident with sagacity. Fortunate accidents can be promoted through strategies that provoke and exploit accidents. Sagacity can be promoted by expanding the company's human potential beyond its immediate needs.<br />5. 'Diverse stimuli.' A stimulus can either push someone in a completely new direction or give that person fresh insight into what her or she has already set out to do. There are four strategies companies can use to promote diverse stimuli: *identify stimuli and provide them to employees, *rotate employees into every job they are capable of doing, *arrange for employees to interact with those outside the company who are likely to be the source of stimuli, *create opportunities for employees to bring into thr organization stimuli they get on their own.<br />6. 'Within-company communication.' Every company tries to ensure effective communication between employees who depend on each other to do their work. However, most organizations overlook the importance of unanticipated communication between employees who do not normally work together. And these exchanges of information often lead to unexpected creative acts. There are three ways a company can promote within-company communication: *provide opportunities for employees who do not normally interact with each other to meet, *ensure that every employee has a sufficient understanding of the organization's activities to be able to tap its resources and expertise, *create a new organizational priority: all employees should know the importance of being responsive to requests for information or help from other employees.<br />Finally, Robinson and Stern write that &quot;If the six elements are implemented in your organization, its overall level of creativity will certainly rise. Use them yourself and you may very well find yourself in the middle of a creative act...Our journey led us to 'discover' the power of the unexpected. Your journey will lead you to 'realize' it.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-09-05

As known, the subject of intellectual capital appeared on the business world in the 1990s. Patrick H.Sullivan writes, in his 'Value-Driven Intellectual Capital,' \\"this history actually began in the early 1980s, as managers, academics, and consultants around the world began to notice that a firm's intangible assets, its intellectual capital, were often a major determinant of the corporation's profits...By the mid 1990s it was becoming clear that there were two separate but related paths of thinking about intellectual capital. One path, the knowledge and brain power path, focused on creating and expanding the firm's knowledge. The other path, the resource-based perspective, was concerned with how to create profits from a firm's unique combinations of intellectual and tangible resources.\\" <br />In this context, by proposing a new intellectual capital measurement and reporting system, Leif Edvinsson and Michael S.Malone elaborate the Skandia Model. According to this model, Skandia divides market value into financial capital and intellectual capital. Intellectual capital is further divided into: <br />1. 'Human Capital.' The combined knowledge, skill, innovativeness, and ability of the company's individual employees to meet the task at hand. It also includes the company's values, culture, and philosophy. It cannot be owned by the company. <br />2. 'Structural Capital.' Brands, trademarks, written procedures for processes, and everything else of organizational capability that supports those employees' productivity-in a word, everything left at the office when the employees go home. Structural capital also includes customer and organizational capital, representing the external and internal focus, respectively, of structural capital. Organizational capital consists of innovation and process capital. Process capital is the sum of know-how that is formalized inside the company: manuals, best practices, intranet resources, project libraries are all part of the process capital. Innovation capital is what creates the success of tomorrow: it is the source of renewal for the whole company, and it includes intellectual assets and intellectual property. Unlike human capital, structural capital can be owned and thereby traded. <br />Finally, they argue that \\"rather than replacing the current financial measurement system, the product of generations, Intellectual Capital measurement in fact complements and augments it. Orthodox accounting has found its way again. It is relevant once more to our future. And thus the work of much of the last millennium is made ready for the next.\\" <br />Highly recommended.	2001-08-26

Instead, it is a discussion of our findings and opinions based on research into how effective companies manage the 'human asset'-the people whose efforts are the basis of any organization's success...This book is designed to serve two purposes. The first is to present the best human asset management practices that my organization, the Saratoga Institute, uncovered during a four-year study of over 1,000 companies. We learned that what constitutes best practice is an interactive set of eight organizational characteristics...My second objective is to expose the wasteful and misleading practices that cause three out of four improvement projects to fall short of their goals&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, in Chapter 1, Jac Fitz-enz identifies the eight driving forces that make up the context from which the best human asset management systems (BHAMs) and processes are derived: an interwoven human-financial value focus, commitment to a long-term core strategy, linkage of culture and systems, massive multidimensional communications, partnering within and outside the company, collaboration within functional groups, innovation through well-planned and managed risk taking, and a competitive passion that is never satisfied with less than constant improvement. Hence, throughout the following chapters, he explains each driving force and presents case studies of BHAM companies both in the U.S. and abroad. And, at the end of each chapter, he gives a short checklist. He says that &quot;build your best practices by answering to those questions, you will have the blueprint for being one of the best human asset management organization.&quot; <br />Finally, he writes, &quot;Wouldn't it make more sense to accept the fact that complex problems can't be solved by simplistic programs or popular panaceas? Instead, take the time youmight put into chasing the newest miracle cure and put it into:<br />* Focusing your organization on value<br />* Making a long-term commitment to a core strategy<br />* Linking your culture to your systems<br />* Communicating everything that people should know <br />* Partnering<br />* Being mutually supportive<br />* Innovating and taking well-considered risks<br />* Never getting complacent.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-08-11

However, we want to shift how to think about and become a better leader. It is faddish to think of leaders as people who master competencies and emanate character. While agreeing with this perspective, we believe that it falls short of assuring that leaders lead. Leaders do much more than demonstrate attributes. Effective leaders get results. This book refocuses and reframes the search for effective leadership by connecting attributes to results...By so doing, this book makes a bold statement about the next generation of leadership thinking. This does not mean less attention to the leader's attributes, but it does mean making sure that leaders understand and commit to the results they must produce-and how they are produced&quot; (pp.1-23).<br />In this context, D.Ulrich, J.Zenger, and N.Smallwood suggest the following fourteen specific actions described in Chapter 7 can help leaders make results a major part of their leadership equation, at whatever level they function in their companies:<br />1. Begin with an absolute focus on results.<br />2. Take complete and personal responsibility for your group's results.<br />3. Clearly and specifically communicate expectations and targets to the people in your group.<br />4. Determine what you need to do personally to improve your results.<br />5. Use results as the litmus test for continuing or implementing leadership practice.<br />6. Engage in developmental activities and opportunities that will help you produce better results.<br />7. Know and use every group member's capabilities to the fullest and provide everyone with appropriate developmental opportunities.<br />8. Experiment and innovate in every realm under your influence, looking constantly for new ways to improve performance.<br />9. Measure the right standards and increase the rigor with which you measure them.<br />10. Cnstantly take action; results won't improve without it.<br />11. Increase the pace or tempo of your group.<br />12. Seek feedback from others in the organization about ways you and your group can improve your outcomes.<br />13. Ensure that your subordinates and colleagues perceive that your motivation for being a leader is the achievement of positive results, not personal or political gain.<br />14. Model the methods and strive for the results you want your group to use and attain.<br />Ulrich, Zenger, and Smallwood argue that these suggestions which may be implemented right now by any leader occupying any position, will modify behavior and improve performance- all without a month-long absence from work or expenditures of large sums of money.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-08-08

Globalization opened the race for the world as firms entered once-closed markets and pursued untapped opportunities. The race for the future compels firms to discover new market opportunities, new solutions for customers, new answers to poorly met needs...This book aims to help managers and their companies to be more successful in creating and guiding their strategic alliances. To that end it offers both conceptual and practical tools for analyzing the design and performance of alliances and presents a wide range of examples of both successful and unsuccessful collaborations&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, Yves L.Doz and Gary Hamel assume that &quot;two corporations have agreed to work together.They have assessed the value creation potential of their alliance and their own strategic compatibility. And they have decided on a design that promises to enhance collaboration and minimize tension. Everything looks good. Yet the fledgling partners find themselves unable to move from planning to implementation. Why?&quot; Hence, in Chapter 6, after exploring in detail the gaps that separate these corporations from the start, they summarize these gaps as following:<br />1. Frame Gap: Perspective and definition for understanding the relationship and heuristic gap rules for behaving within it, driving day-to-day interaction.<br />2. Expectations Gap: Benchmark against which the actual performance (or the strength of early signals alerting to performance difficulties) is to be assessed.<br />3. Organizational Context Gap: Structure and process for decision making, work, oreganization and performance, and organizational learning may be more or less compatible between partners.<br />4. Confidence Gap: Self-confidence allows strong personal commitments and personal risk taking in cooperation; lack of confidence makes wholehearted cooperation difficult.<br />5. Skill Understanding Gap: Need to combine and blend differentiated skills between partners, in particular where process integration is required.<br />6. Task Definition Gap: Need to define a concrete set of tasks in order to start operational and tangible cooperation.<br />7. Information Gap: Need to share information.<br />8. Time Gap: Need to keep balance of costs and benefits in perspective over time, for each partner and between partners.<br />Hence, they explore how these gaps can be closed. And they say as a common theme runs through their recommendations that &quot;companies should invest in their understanding of the situation and gather intelligence about their partners. They should view the inception of the partner relationship as an opportunity to learn and to improve. This may be more important than blindly rushing into implementation of joint task.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-07-21

The other path, the resource-based perspective, was concerned with how to create profits from a firm's unique combinations of intellectual and tangible resources.&quot;<br />In this context, Annie Brooking defines intellectual capital as the term given to the combined intangible assets which enable the company to function. And hence, she formulates her first IC concept as 'Enterprise = Tangible Assets + Intellectual Capital.' According to Brooking, the intelectual capital of an enterprise can be split into following four categories:<br />1. Market assets: all market related intangibles, including brands, customers, customer loyalty, company name, backlog, distribution channels, business collaborations, various contracts and agreements such as licensing, franchises and so on.<br />2. Intellectual property assets: know-how, trade secrets, copyright, patent, design rights, and trade and service marks.<br />3. Human-centred assets: education, vocational qualifications, work related knowledge, occupational assessments, psychometrics, and work related competencies.<br />4. Infrastructure assets: management philosophy, corporate culture, management processes, information technology systems, networking systems, and financial relations.<br />At last words, she saysthat &quot;our method brings together intangible assets which most companies already have but fail to manage in a coherent way...Organizations that realize their ability to succeed in the third millennium will be dominated by intangible assets are already putting their intellectual capital teams together.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.<br />Recommended readings on Intellectual Capital:<br />* Johan Roos et.al. - Intellectual Capital<br />* Patrick H.Sullivan - Value-Driven Intellectual Capital<br />* Thomas A.Stewart - Intellectual Capital<br />* Leif Edvinsson and Michael S.Malone - Intellectual Capital<br />* Karl-Erik Sveiby - The New Organizational Wealth	2001-07-14

Deming asserted in his fourteen obligations of managment that quality was impossible where people are afraid to tell the truth...Besides Dming, other voices strongly reinforce the need to understand the dynamics and effects of fear. Chris Argyris's extensive body of work clarifies how invisible and self-reinforcing miscommunication due to fear can be. Peter Senge's explorations of systems thinking illuminate its far-reaching effects. Both of these thinkers underscore the need to understand the negative assumptions about people that keep fear in place. Peter Block's works on empowerment and stewardship demand a wholesale rethinking of the concepts of management and leadership as a way to escape thses destructive beliefs. Most recently, Thomas Stewart's examination of the rapidly emerging value of intellectual capital demands that even more attention be paid to reducing fear and building trust&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, Kathleen D.Ryan and Daniel K.Oestreich, with the following core questions, illustrate some important elements of the trust-fear continuum. They say that if your answers to these questions are all 'yes,' your workplace is clearly fear-based:<br />* Do a high proportion of people in your organization frequently hesitate to speak up about certain issues?<br />* Does a fear of speaking up exist at many levels in your organization?<br />* Are people in your workplace associating managers and supervisors with th presence of fear?<br />* Are leaders in your organization exhibiting behavior that causes employees to be afraid?<br />* Are people reacting with strong emotions to a perceived environment of fear?<br />* Is fear having an impact on work and how it is getting done?<br />Thus, by describingthe following 'core behaviors,' they define the vision of a high-trust workplace: *mutual helpfulness and understanding, *serving as a reality check for one another, *providing feedback for one another, on strengths as well as areas that need improvement, *influencing each other's ideas and decisions; willingness to be influenced, *humor; enjoyment of each other's company, *creative, synergistic problem solving where the results are greater than the sum of the parts, *respect for different backgrounds and talents; reliance on one another's expertise to ensure the best results, *willingness and ability to work through conflicts and disagreements, *common commitment to the same goal; commitment to one another's success, *a high level of rapport and honesty with one another, *straightforward communication.<br />They argue that the vision of a high-trust workplace can draw people naturally away from the cycle of fear and mistrust toward a new set of possibilities for better workplace relationships, and hence high-performance organization.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-07-04

Yet only in the past few decades have social scientists devoted much time or attention to developing ideas about how organizations work (or why they often fail)...Our purpose in this book is to sort through the multiple voices competing for managers' attention. In the process, we have consolidated major schools of organizational thought into four perspectives. There are many ways to label such perspectives. We have schosen the label 'frames.' Frames are both windows on the world and lenses that bring the world into focus. Frames filter out some things while allowing others to pass through easily. Frames help us order experience and decide what to do. Every manager, consultant, or policymaker relies on a personal frame or image to gather information, make judgments, and determine how best to get things done&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, Lee G.Bolman and Terrence E.Deal devote four parts of their book to detailed description and discussion of these frames. And they firstly determine basic assumptions behind each frame as following:<br />1. The Structural Frame: *Organizations exist to achieve established goals and objectives. *Organizations work best when rationality prevails over personal preferences and external pressures. *Structures must be designed to fit an organization's circumstances. *Organizations increase efficiency and enhance performance through specialization and division of labor. *Appropriate forms of coordination and control are essential to ensuring that individuals and units work together in the service of organizational goals. *Problems and performance gaps arise from structural deficiencies and can be remedied through restructuring.<br />2. The Human Resource Frame: *Organizations exist to serve human needs tarher than the reverse. *People and organizations need each other: organizations need ideas, energy, and talent; people need careers, salaries, and opportunities. *When the fit between individual and system is poor, one or both suffer: individuals will be exploited or will exploit the organization-or both will become victims. *A good fit benefits both: individuals find meaningful and satisfying work, and organizations get the talent and energy they need to succeed.<br />3. The Political Frame: *Organizations are coalitions of various individuals and interest groups. *There are enduring differences among coalition members in values, beliefs, information, interest, and perceptions of reality. *Most important decisions involve the allocation of scarce resources-who gets what. *Scarce resources and enduring differences give conflict a central role in organizational dynamics and make power the most important resource. *Goals and decisions emerge from bargaining, negotiation, and jockeying for position among different stakeholders.<br />4. The Symbolic Frame: *What is most important about any event is not what happened but what it means. *Activity and meaning are loosely coupled: events have multiple meanings because people interpret experience differently. *Most of life ambiguous or uncertain-what happened, why it happened, or what will happen next are all puzzles. *High levels of ambiguity and uncertainty undercut rational analysis, problem solving, and decision making. *In the face of uncertainty and ambiguity, people create symbols to resolve confusion, increase predictability, provide direction, and anchor hope and faith. *Many events and processes are more important for what is expressed than what is produced. They form a cultural tapestry of secular myths, rituals, ceremonies, and stories that help people find meaning, purpose, and passion.<br />Finally, in the last part of the book, they focus on the implications of these frames for central issues in managerial practice, including leadership, change, and ethics.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-07-02

D.Wren and R.Greenwood write, in their 'Management Innovators,' &quot;Deming was critical of U.S. management, perhaps because he had been ignored far so long, but more probably because U.S. firms were losing market share to more quality-oriented competitors. He blamed U.S. management because the wealth of a nation did not depend on its natural resources but on its people, management, and goverment: 'The probem is where to find good management. It would be a mistake to export American management to a friendly country.' &quot;<br />In this context, in Chapter 2, in order to transform American industry, Deming presents the 14 points that constitute his theory of management:<br />1. Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs.<br />2. Adopt new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western management must awaken to the challenge, must learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for change.<br />3. Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Eliminate the need for inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first place.<br />4. End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag. Instead, minimize total cost. Move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.<br />5. Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs. <br />6. Institute training on the job.<br />7. Institute leadership. The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job. Supervision of management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production workers.<br />8. Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company.<br />9. Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and in use that may be encountered with the product or service.<br />10. Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships, as the bulk of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the work force.<br />11. Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical goals. Substitute leadership.<br />12. Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality. Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means, inter alia, abolishment of the annual or merit rating and of management by objective.<br />13. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.<br />14. Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody's job.<br />According to Deming application of these points will transform style of management. Unfortunately, some deadly diseases stand in the way of transformation. Thus, in Chapter 3, he identifies seven deadly diseases that cause the decline of American industry:<br />1. Lack of constancy of purpose to plan product and service that will have a market and keep the company in business, and provide jobs.<br />2. Emphasis on short-term profits.<br />3. Evaluation of performance, merit rating, or annual review.<br />4. Mobility of management, job hopping.<br />5. Management by use only of visible figures, with little or no consideration of figures that are unknown or unknowable.<br />6. Excessive medical costs.<br />7. Excessive costsof liability, swelled by lawyers that work on contigency fees.<br />I highly recommend this business classic for all managers.	2001-06-27

With concrete examples from their consulting experiences, Thomas P.Flannery, David A.Hofrichter, and Paul Platten clearly explain how to develop compensation strategies to support business values, work cultures, and strategic goals.<br />In the literature, the Hay system has been criticized because it may promote a bureaucratic culture and because it fails to differentiate between high and low performers or contributors. For example, Edward E.Lawler writes, in his 'Rewarding Excellence,' &quot;the Hay system is the most commonly used approach for determining pay and reward levels in large organizations, although numerous other evaluation systems have also been developed. There is a real question, however, about whether Hay or any of the others is the best approach in today's business environment...Job evaluation fits a traditional bureaucratic approach to management that relies heavily on control through job descriptions, standardization of work, and hierarchical levels of management.&quot; On the other hand, after defining the Hay system as 'pay for empire,' Peter Block argues, in 'Stewardship,' &quot;it is a widely accepted method of using job descriptions- including the number of direct reports, type of budget responsibility, and levels of responsibility and decision-making authority- to make rational the different pay levels within an organization. For what it was asked to accomplish, this system has done an elegant and durable job. But we must question exactly what it was we asked the Hay system to do-to pay people based on the size of their territory, number of subordinates, budget size, level of authority...Soften it if you like, but these are measures of empire, not contribution to the organization.&quot;<br />In this context, the authors say that &quot;certainly there is truth in Block's statement. Indeed, as the title of our book suggests, people and their performance-their contribution both as individuals and as members of the organizational team-are the linchpins of any effective compensation strategy. But that title and statement do not, despite what our critics might say, signal a sudden shift in our philosophy about pay. The fact is, we've always believed that people and how they performed constitute the foundation of any successful business strategy. We've always believed that compensation is an important element of a successful human resources equation that puts people first...When the Hay system is properly used in the right circumstances, it can still be very effective in creating people-and performance-oriented pay programs.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this reference source on the Hay system.	2001-06-19

'The Organization of the Future' is an outstanding integration of much of the current thinking of leadership, organization, strategy, change, and innovation. Frances Hesselbein, Marshall Goldsmith, and Richard Beckhard (editors) have gathered together in this collection remarkable 49 thought thinkers.<br />Charles Handy suggests in his chapter that &quot;Margaret Wheatley, in 'Leadership and the New Science,' has written of the danger of believing in Newtonian organization in a quantum age. Newton wasn't wrong. He just wasn't right enough to cope with the dilemmas of science now. Similarly, the old way of looking at organizations wasn't wrong; it just does not capture the real essence of what it means to organize today.&quot; On the other hand, Peter F.Drucker notes in his introduction, &quot;...now a totaly different approach is emerging, not replacing the older approaches but being superimposed on them: it says that the purpose of organizations is to get results 'outside,' that is, to achieve performance in the market. The organization is, however, more than a machine...It is more than economic, defined by results in the marketplace. The organization is, above all, 'social.' It is people. Its purpose must therefore be to make the strengths of people effective and their weaknesses irrelevant.&quot;<br />In this context, the editors divide this book into six parts. They write in their preface, &quot;throughout the chapters in this book, the need for organizations is unquestioned. The authors provide a variety of forms and operating plans for organizations today and tomorrow; at the same time, each recognizes the indispensable role of organizations to human accomplishment and achievement.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-06-12

It contains detailed, valuable lessons for all those interested in Jack Welch and his GE, as revolutionaries.<br />Noel M.Tichy and Stratford Sherman write, &quot;The old way, exemplified by Henry Ford's production line, calls for top managers to analyze the work that needs to be done, then devise rules even an idiot can follow. Managers, divorced from the actual work, become bureaucrats, while their frustrated subordinates tighten the bolts...The new way-GE's way-breaks the intellectual framework that defines the limits of traditional management...Instead of seeking better ways to control workers, Welch says he aims to liberate them. As he explains, that goal is based on self-interest: The old organization was built on control, but the world has changed. The world is moving at such a pace that control has become a limitation. It slows you down. You've got to balance freedom with some control, but you've got to have more freedom than you ever dreamed of&quot; (pp.19-20).<br />At this point, after outlining basic characteristics of old and new ways, Noel M.Tichy describes the difference between them in terms of sports:<br />1. Old Way-Machine Age: Hierarchical, control-focused, and bureaucratic. He notes, &quot;The old GE resembled a football team: Each player had carefully prescribed roles, yielding a carefully orchestrated pattern. The coach called all the plays. Even the strategic-planning guidebook that governed GE policy were like the playbooks in football.&quot;<br />2. New Way-Information Age: Networks, flexibility, knowledge, and creation. He notes, &quot;The New Way GE is like hockey; roles are blurred, play flows uncontrollably from one side of the rink to the other, there are no timeouts, players adjust to new situations almost every moment and think for themselves while looking out for the team as a whole.&quot;<br />In this context, throughout the book, Tichy and Sherman show GE's process of corporate transformation as three-act drama.<br />I highly recommend this business classic to all revolutionaries of the new century.	2001-06-08

It should be on every manager's must-read list.<br />Peter F.Drucker writes in his foreword, &quot;Leadership must be learned and can be learned-and this, of course, is what this book was written and should be used for.&quot; And hence, he defines simple but basic characteristics of effective leaders:<br />1. The only definition of a 'leader' is someone who has 'followers.' Some people are thinkers. Some are prophets. Both roles are important and badly needed. But without followers, there can be no leaders.<br />2. An effective leader is not someone who is loved or admired. He or she is someone whose followers do the right things. Popularity is not leadership. 'Results' are.<br />3. Leaders are highly visible. They therefore set 'examples.'<br />4. Leadership is not rank, privileges, titles, or money. It is 'responsibility.'<br />After this excellent foreword, Frances Hesselbein, Marshall Goldsmith and Richard Beckhard divide this seminal book into four parts. Here, they note that &quot;These parts have been chosen in a somewhat arbitrary manner. We deliberately gave the authors a free hand, and our revisions have been only mirror. The authors are all experts in their own right, and we wanted you to hear their views in an unfiltered form.&quot;<br />It is a great chance to read never before published essays of 37 distinguished authors under one roof.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-06-07

Would you like to know how your customers can benefit from your electronic business initiatives? Patricia B.Seybold writes, &quot;That's what this book is about. This book summarizes the best practices for electronic commerce and electronic business today on the Internet and beyond.&quot;<br />In this context, she identifies eight critical success factors in electronic commerce and e-business as following:<br />1. Target the right customers- * Know who your customers and prospects are. * Find out which customers are profitable. * Decide which customers you want to attract (or keep from losing). * Know which customers influence key purchases. * Find out which customers generate referrals. * Don't confuse customers, partners, and stakeholders.<br />2. Own the customer's total experience- * Deliver a consistent, 'branded' experience. * Focus on saving customers time and irritation. * Offer peace of mind. * Work with partners to deliver consistent service and quality. * Respect the customer's individuality. * Give customers control over their experience.<br />3. Streamline business processes that impact the customer- * Start by identfying the end customer. * Streamline the process for key stakeholders. * Continuously improve the process based on customer feedback. * Give everyone involved a clear view of the process.<br />4. Provide a 360-degree view of the customer relationship- * Provide one-stop shopping for the customer. * 'Remember' everything your company know about the customer. * Ensure that everyone in the company has access to the complete customer picture. * Put an underlying technical infrastructure into place to provide a 360-degree view.<br />5. Let customers help themselves- * Let customers help themselves to information and perform transactions on-line. * Let customers interact using whatever media they choose. * Give customers the ability to design their own products.<br />6. Help customers do their jobs- * Develop a deep understanding of how your customers do their jobs. * Continuously refine your business processes to make it easier for your customers to do their jobs. * Give customers direct access to your inventory. * Gve customers the ammunition and tools they need to make purchasing decision. * Prepare bills the way your customers need them. * Make it easy for your customers to satisfy their customers.<br />7. Deliver personalized service- * Develop a warm, personal relationship with each customer. * Let customers specify and modify their profiles. * Custom-tailor information presentation and offers based on customers' profiles. * Provide appropriate service and information based on customers' needs. * Give customers access to their transaction histories. * Encourage customers to 'leave something of themselves behind.'<br />8. Foster community- * Seduce customers into the fold. * Introduce customers to others with common interests. * Introduce and reinforce common terminology and values. * Let customers 'strut their stuff.' * Encourage customers to become part of the 'in crowd.'<br />Finally, she writes, &quot;I strongly recommend starting with the first success factor, targeting the right customers. If you don't start there, the rest of the factors may be well executed, but you'll be wasting time on the wrong customer population. After that, however, there are no hard-and-fast rules to decide which success factor to work on next. Indeed, most of these factors are interrelated, and you'll find, as you begin to focus on one, that you've gone a long way towards finding solutions to others.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-06-05

Daniel A.Wren and Ronald G.Greenwood give tomorrow's leaders indispensable lessons from 'the people and ideas that have shaped modern business.'<br />They write that &quot;our goal is to portray a selection of individuals whose ideas have made a difference in the way we teach and practice business management. In selecting these figures, we realize that it would be impossible to chronicle all of their activities; we could have chosen other individuals of equal stature as well. We have kept in mind an audience of contemporary managers, aspiring managers, and students of management who wish to gain a historical perspective on their profession by sketching the people and ideas that contributed to the formation of modern management&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, Wren and Greenwood divide their book into two parts:<br />* Part One- In this part, they trace the beginnings of American enterprise in inventing, manufacturing, selling, transportation, communication, and financing. They argue that these fourteen individuals set a pattern for others to follow as U.S. business enterprise grew.<br />* Part Two- In this part, in order to portray the search for better ways to manage, they present stories of other influential individuals.

Here, they ask, &quot;What is unique and even provocative about it?&quot;:<br />* It is unpredictable. Competing on the edge is about surprise.<br />* It is uncontrolled. It is not about command and precision planning by senior executives.<br />* It is inefficient. Competing on the edge is not necessarily efficient in the short term.<br />* It is proactive. Competing on the edge is not about passively watching for the occasional discontinuity or waiting for other firms to move before taking action.<br />* It is continuous. It is about a rhythm of moves over time; not a set of disjointed actions.<br />* It is diverse. Competing on the edge is about making a variety of moves with varying scale and risk.<br />In this context, they write that &quot;the premise of this book is that change is pervasive. The implcation is that the key strategic challenge facing managers in many contemporary businesses is managing this change. The challenge is to react quickly, anticipate when possible, and lead change where appropriate. A manager's dilemma is how to do this, not just once or every now and then, but consistently. Our book has argued that competing on the edge is the unpredictable, often uncontrolled, and even inefficient strategy that nonetheless defines best practice when change is pervasive.&quot; And,then, they list ten rules of competing on the edge that articulate the key assumptions andbest practices about strategy, organization, and leadership that they have found to characterize firms that compete on the edge:<br />I- Strategy<br />Rule 1. Advantage is temporary.<br />Rule 2. Strategy is diverse, emergent, and complicated.<br />Rule 3. Reinvention is the goal.<br />II- Organization<br />Rule 4. Live in the present.<br />Rule 5. Stretch out the past.<br />Rule 6. Reach into the future.<br />Rule 7. Time pace change.<br />III- Leadership<br />Rule 8. Grow the strategy.<br />Rule 9.

Jay A.Conger, Gretchen M.Spreitzer, and Edward E.Lawler III divide this invaluable volume into four parts. As written by them, Part Three-Chapter Seven, by Robert E.Quinn and Nancy T.Snyder, introduces Advanced Change Theory (ACT), arguing that the leaders must change him- or herself first to ensure that his or her deed and actions are consistent with the vision of the future before expecting others to change. <br />In this context, R.E.Quinn and N.T.Snyder identify thirteen assumptions/principles of ACT as following:<br />1. Assumptions of relationship: alignment with changing reality requires relationships of inclusion, openness, and emergent community.<br />2. Assumptions of purpose: to establish an emergent community, a change agent must put the pursuit of the common good ahead of self interest.<br />3. Assumptions of resistance: to maintain alignment with changing reality and with the common good, a change agent focuses on internal sources of resistance, continually seeking to reduce self-deception and personal hypocrisy.<br />4. Assumptions of influence: in influencing others, the change agent first models the courage and discipline of self modification, the resulting integrity then serves to influence others by attracting them into a relationship, or community, of mutual support and exploration.<br />5. Assumptions of empowerment: by transcending self-deception and personal hypocrisy, the change agent empowers and frees the self from the controlling sanctions within the existing social system.<br />6. Assumptions of enlightenment: in freeing self from external sanctions through personal modification, the change agent obtains increased understanding, enlightenment, or vision about direction and strategy.<br />7. Assumptions of volition: the change agent's increased understanding and personal empowerment result in increased reverence for the potential and the volition of the change target.<br />8. Assumptions of motivation: given the high respect for the volition of the change target, the change agent seeks to inspire growth by attracting the change target to engage in noble tasks of service for the higher good of the community.<br />9. Assumptions of causality: the change agent recognizes the change target's need for relationship and assumes that change happens as a nonlinear process of mutuality and cocreation that further requires continued integrity and increasing trust.<br />10. Asumptions of strategic vision: the change agent's efforts in self-modification and empowerment result in increased cognitive complexity and the ability to see larger governing rules or seemingly paradoxical relationships.<br />11. Assumptions of behavior: freed from the influence of the existing sanction system, and holding a more complex or paradoxical world view, the change agent engages in unconventional behaviors that distort routines, capture attention, and move the system toward the edge of chaos.<br />12. Assumptions of determination: the change agent assumes that altered internal states determine altered external states.<br />13. Assumptions of action: the change agent is a self-authorizing person with a bias for action and enactment under uncertainty.<br />Throughout the presentation of ACT, each of these assumptions is illustrated by a quote from three transformational change agents: Jesus Christ, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. Then, Quinn and Snyder explore the applicability of ACT in an account of a cultural change effort at Whirlpool under the leadership of its CEO David Whitwam.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-05-10

They are drawn from people's basic humaness...The subtle forces are not the body; they are in the mind, heart, and spirit within the body. In our review of the literature on leadership, and through our consulting and classroom experiences,&quot; Richard L.Daft and Robert H.Lengel write, &quot;we have observed many subtle expressions of mind, heart, and spirit. For the purposes of our discussion of fusion leadership, we have identified six subtle forces that embrace the essence of human potential and ingenuity. The subtle aspects of intellect are captured in mindfulness and vision. The subtle forces of emotion are revealed through heart and communication. And the subtle forces of spirit are reflected in courage and integrity. These six forces define the underlying potential for leadership and change&quot; (p.20).<br />In this context, to describe organizational leadership by reference to principles of fusion (joining together) rather than fission (splitting apart, separating), throughout the book, by making extensive use of stories, parables, and metaphors, they discuss six subtle forces of fusion leadership. The ideas about these forces are briefly summarized as below:<br />1. Mindfulness: See subtle forces, take position as beginner, maintain open mind, be tentative, set aside opinions, ask questions, create labels and categories, challenge assumptions, welcome opposites, see subtle flows and relationships, see whole and part, and encourage multiple approaches.<br />2. Vision: Create future, facilitate hopes and dreams, pursue higher purpose that touches the heart, inspire people, focus on values and yearnings, consider dreams concrete and reliable, think big and do the impossible, cherish vision as motivating and energizing, and live by hope and personal experience.<br />3. Heart: Stay emotionally connected with people and work, base choices on finding bliss, look for hidden potentials, seek out people who express emotions, hold that emotions are truth, be collaborative and interdependent, and pay attention to ideas and people with emotional power.<br />4. Communication: Listen, discern other's needs, focus on big picture, frame of reference and meanings, transmit symbolic images and stories, cultivate face-to-face contract, celbrate completed task, direct message to heart, and ask questions.<br />5. Courage: Assert nonconformity, follow higher purpose, seek to serve, act as iron, feel fear and admit failure, support failure as way to grow and learn, name demons and speak truth, disagree and say no, act on faith and trust, and accept support from others.<br />6. Integrity: Inspire trust, share information, power and resources, seek interdependence, meet unstated needs, serve others, affirm, build and mentor others, acknowledge other's great deeds, empower others and faith in others, set high moral standards, and deepen insight into self.<br />Finally, they write that &quot;Each of these subtle forces can be released to provide powerful motivation for leadership and change. These forces can transform organizations, and fusion is the process through which they are unlocked.&quot;  <br />Highly recommended.	2001-04-29

We usually think of persuasion as something reserved for salespeople-certainly not for managers. What I am going to propose to you is that, quite to the contrary, persuasion skills have become absolutely essential to the job of managing-far more than we might imagine. Much of what a good manager does today is sell: sell their ideas to coworkers; sell their organizations on change; sell their bosses on new investments. But it's not traditional selling. A large part of what we do as effective managers is to find optimal solutions for problems through investigation, discussion, and debate. We then convince our organization to get behind them. It is in the convincing part that we face our greatest hurdless-getting buy-in. This is where the skills of constructive persuasion play a vital role. So leave behind your older notions of persuasion. It's time for a paradigm shift. Your effectiveness depends on it&quot; (pp.14-15).<br />In this context, in Chapter 2, after listing wrong ideas about persuasion as following:<br />1. persuasion is simply mustering the best arguments for something;<br />2. persuasion almost always involves stating your position up front;<br />3. persuasion means being assertive-often very assertive; and<br />4. negotiating and deal making are at the heart of it.<br />Jay A. Conger writes that &quot;These are some of the stereotypes people have about the act of convincing. There are several others. Together I call them the 'killer myths' of persuasion-'killer' because they can kill our ability to be effective and our motivation to become better persuaders.&quot;<br />Killer Myth 1- The most effective persuasion is the hard sell.<br />Killer Myth 2- Persuasion is a one-way process.<br />Killer Myth 3- Effective persuaders succeed on the first try.<br />Killer Myth 4- Good persuaders don't need to compromise.<br />Killer Myth 5- Great arguments are the secret to successful persuasion.<br />Killer Myth 6- Persuasion is pure manipulation.<br />As a result, he writes that &quot;Now that we know what persuasion isn't, we may be wondering what constructive persuasion really is.&quot; Hence, he shows four distinct steps such as (i)building your credibility, (ii)finding the common ground, (iii)developing compelling positions and evidence, and (iv)connecting emotionally to becoming an effective persuader, and he discusses these steps/the four elements of effective persuasion throuhout the following four (3-6) chapters.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-04-29

You can cut costs and improve profits dramatically by learning to work with these systems rather than against them. So, what is self-organization and how does it work?...In this book,&quot; Susanne Kelly and Mary Ann Allison write, &quot;we build on complexity science to explain and apply the principles of self-organization to business and organizational behavior. We discuss the enterprise environment and energy that leaders must provide to generate the power and precision of laser-sharp business performance&quot;(p.4).<br />In this context, in Chapter 1, after defining complexity science and complexity advantage, they argue that &quot;Complexity advantage companies address today's transition in business-plagued by rapid change and increasing uncertainty. For approximately a century our manufacturing model was comparatively stable...The Information Age has turned previous 'knowns' upside-down...The best business plan is only a best guess.&quot; And hence they summarize the old and new business paradigms as following:<br />I. Manufacturing Age Business<br />* Game: Bulk-material manufacturing.<br />* Goal: Commodity product.<br />* Domain: Regional.<br />* Future: Predictability, deterministic.<br />* Change Periodic nuance, steady rate, digestable.<br />* Rules: Linear cause and effect.<br />* Game plan:Five-year strategic plans.<br />* Leader: Manages strategic plan to end state.<br />* Ownership: Centralized decision-making and responsibility.<br />* Challenge: Demand versus capacity to deliver.<br />* Resources: Material and financial capital.<br />* Risk: Moving too quickly-out of control.<br />* Approach: Quality, low cost of production. Branding, emergent price standards. Diminishing returns.<br />* Role of Team: Optimizing of quality and productivity. Application of raw energy. Repetitive day-to-day operations. Processing of resources.<br />* Process Perspective: Parts interact in sequence of steps. End-to-end effiency key, standardization the answer.<br />II. Information Age Business<br />* Game: Design and use of technology.<br />* Goal: Knowledge-based products.<br />* Domain: Global.<br />* Future: Uncertainty, probability, possibility.<br />* Change: Way of life - accelerating, overwhelming.<br />* Rules: Nonlinear complex interaction.<br />* Game Plan: Three-year probability scenarios.<br />* Leader: Envisions and coaches on direction.<br />* Ownership: Distributed decision-making and responsibility.<br />* Challenge: Demand versus capacity for change.<br />* Resources: Human, social, or intellectual capital.<br />* Risk: Moving too slowly-out of the running.<br />* Approach: Be first-best if possible, high-cost R&amp;D. Market lock-on, high margins. Increasing returns.<br />* Role of Team: Quality:productivity:adaptability. Application of ideas. Quest for innovation. Processing of information.<br />* Process Perspective: Whole emerges from interacting parts. Micro-to macrointegrity key, feedback the answer.    <br />Finally, they write that &quot;By the way, if you are part of a start-up or a small-to-medium-sized business, don't be fooled by the adjective global. Today, satellite communications, the Internet, and air transport move information, materials, products, and people rapidly from place to place. All of us are now connected through a global market comprising mail-order customers and suppliers, supply chain partnership, and international franchise competition. Even our local pizza parior has installed a fax machine and is designing a Web site. They must compete not only with the deli down the street, but also with global fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, and Pizza Hut. Without the complexity advantage, they risk the fate of dinosaurs.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-04-25

The process is nothing less than a revolution, breaking down once sacrosanct boundaries of space, time, and nationality...In today's world, there is no longer a dichotomy between domestic and foreign. Global boundaries between companies, markets, and people have become irrevocably blurred...For companies such as Unilever, ABB, and SmithKline Beecham, globalization has become a natural part of their business, an integral part of their culture. For most companies, however, the goal to become truly global in mindset, staff, and market seems a stretch. Although the oportunities are tempting, the effort, knowledge, and skill required are much greater than for running a domestic operation, and the risks-once you probe beneath the surface-are equally enormous&quot;(pp.261-262).<br />In this context, the authors, in Chapter 8, first put forward the following ten reasons why organizations might want to become more global: competitive survival, cost spreading, trailblazing, rule of three, domino effect, evolutionary forces, technological revolution, search for innovation, ripple effect, and benchmarking against other companies. Then, they discuss seven challenges companies face in making the global leap: (1)Establishing a workable global structure, (2)Hiring global supermanagers, (3)Managing people for a global environment, (4)Learning to love cultural differences, (5)Avoiding parochialism and arrogance, (6)Designing unifying mechanisms and a global mindset, (7)Overcoming complexity.<br />In Chapter 9, to overcome these challenges, they show action plans, and suggest ways of moving forward, from learner to launcher and from launcher to leader into the global arena as summarized as below:<br />I- From Global Learner to Global Launcher<br />1. Human Resources Practices<br />* Supply language/cultural sensitivity training.<br />* Standardize forms andprocedures.<br />* Set up an overseas presence via joint venture, modest acquisition, or establishment of a headquarters.<br />* Engage in extensive cross-border relationship building.<br />2. Organizational Structures<br />* Arrange short-term visits and international assignments.<br />* Staff for more diversity in management and board of directors.<br />* Use e-mail and videoconferencing to maintain day-to-day contact.<br />3. Organizational Processes and Systems<br />* Establish worldwide shared values, language, and operating principles.<br />* Conduct fact-finding missions.<br />* Design ad hoc transnational teams.<br />* Hold global town meetings and best-practice exchanges of information.<br />II- From Global Launcher to Global Leader<br />1. Human Resources Practices<br />* Seek complete liquidity of human resources: recruit outside the domestic base; place foreign recruits within the domestic base; promote the best people to global assignments; rotate people internationally; use twinning.<br />* Aim for a global structure.<br />* Map global processes.<br />2. Organizational Structure<br />* Provide continuing global leadership trining and regular transnational training to reinforce the global mindset.<br />* Remove/minimize country managers and replace with global managers and focus on global customers.<br />* Routinize real-time global communications.<br />3. Organizational Processes and Systems<br />* Use global reward systems.<br />* Multiply ongoing transnational project teams.<br />* Work for global integration (for example, total global sourcing, global design, global engineering, and global purchasing).<br />Finally, they write that &quot;Many tools are available to organizations, and we have described a good number of them here (as summarized above). But senior management must have the skill and foresight to use the right tools in the right way, at the right time, and in the right sequence...Each stage requires structures that enable the crossing ofboundaries, systems and procedures that drive global behavior, and people who can learn to extend their thinking beyond their present outlook.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-04-22

In our analysis, these methods failed to transform the DNA, or fundamental design principle, that informs how organizations are structured and managed...When we understood that these two diamectrically opposed traditions for designing and managing organizations were competng for dominance, it became clear to us why managrs and employees were often being bombarded by mixed messages and a confusing mishmash of structures, management styles, and techniques. The bureaucratic and democratic design principles are based on different logics; each constitutes a distinct class with a specific genetic order...When these logics are mixed together in efforts to shore up the failings of bureaucracy, empowerment and reengineering efforts often fizzle because the basic tenets of a traditional hierarchy have not been uprooted...This book describes the principles and methods for designing the self-managing organization. We show how companies in any industry can change and evolve to become fully self-managing organizations&quot;(from the Preface).<br />In this context, Ronald E. Purser and Steven Cabana, in Chapter 8, outline fundamental choices of two competing organizational design paradigms as following:<br />I- Bureaucratic Structure: Coordination and control of work tasks is done by supervisor.<br />1. Mind Set...*People have specialized skills and are easily replaced. *The work (technical system) is designed first. The people (social system) must adopt and fit in. *Workers are cogs in the machine of the enterprise, a commodity. *Total specialization of everything. *Within a complex organization, simple jobs are created. *Tthe building block of the organization is one person- one task. *Competitive structures, processes and reward systems are the best way to produce high performance.<br />2. People Act AsIf...*The environment our enterprise exists in is stable and unchanging. *There is little to learn at work; success comes from reacting resourcefully to problems. *Procedures are sufficient to guide behavior. Change interferes with productivity and can often be postponed. *Responsibility, and blame can be shifted to others; we are separate and therefore I can win at your expense. *We don't need to coordinate work closely with other functions. Their problems are their problems. *Unspoken assumptions need not to be explored. Simple solutions to problems are adequate.<br />II- Democratic Structure: Coordination and control of work is done by those doing the work.<br />1. Mind Set...*People possess many skill sets and can do many jobs/functions. *The needs of the work (technical system) are balanced with the needs of the doers of the work (social system). *People are learners. Machines and information systems can extend the skill set of employees to many functions. *As little as possible is specified, leaving the rest to the skill and discreation of the workers. *Complex jobs are created within a simple organizational structure. *The building block of organization is the self-managed work team. *Cooperative structures and reward systems are the best way to produce high performance.<br />2. People Act As If...*The environment our enterprise exists in is constantly changing. *Skepticism and doubt are valuable and enable continuous learning. *Outcomes are best reached with flexibility built into the approach. *I am fully responsible for any work I agree to perform. *Every task is part of some larger whole. I can't win at your expense. *Everyone's ideas are taken seriously. Cooperation is essential for our mutual survival. *Making our assumptions explicit and exploring them is worth the temporary discomfort.<br />Hence, in order to transform an entire enterprise to self-management, they discuss these choices within the context of Participative Design method. And they arguethat &quot;Dmocratic business organizations won't solve all the world's problems, but they will be places where people can find meaning in their work. Work becomes meaningful when people have attained real membership status, when work is restored to its rightful place, which adds value to both the customer and to the worker, and when people are shapers and creators of the organization's future.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-04-22

Human capital. The single most important driver of organizational performance and individual managerial success is talent. The ability to actually do what every company and every manager professes to do-hire the best-is what distinguishes premier companies from mediocre firms, successful versus ordinary careers. The vast majority of organizations and managers simply can't figure out how to overcome the many obstacles to packing their team with A players...Topgrading shows you how premier companies such as General Electric gain a talent advantage, how every manager can benefit from learning leading-edge techniques. Jack Welch, Chairman and CEO of GE, said, 'The reality is, we simply cannot afford to field anything but teams of A players.'&quot;<br />In this context, Bradford D. Smart;<br />* defines topgrading in simple terms and then presents short examples of companies that topgrade,<br />* presents (i)the major pyschological and organizational obstacles to topgrading, and (ii)the best practices to overcome them, <br />* presents a groundbreaking quantification of the costs associated with making hiring mistakes,<br />* discusses the moral issues in firing people,<br />* examines recruitment approaches and offers improvements,<br />* presents you with nine keys to becoming an A player at the highest level,<br />* helps you fix your weaknesses, which is more important than spending additional time developing your strengths,<br />* explains the Chronological In-Depth Structured (CIDS)-based coaching and interview principles, and presents three case studies to apply these principles with finesse and ease,<br />* presents the CIDS interview model in its entirety-what it is, advanced interviewing tactics, and how to avoid employement-related legal problems.<br />Finally, he writes, &quot;Everyone wants toknow the key to individual and corporate success. I think I know. Forty-thousand case studies devoted to scrutinizing 50 competencies provide some clues. Jack Welch of GE asked me which, of all those competencies, was the single most important for helping someone become an A player. Larry Bossidy of AlliedSignal asked the same question. So did Ted Waitt, CEO and largest shareholder of Gateway. After the CIDS interview, managers frequently say, 'Wow, Doc, since you've been studying careers in such detail for so many years, can you give me the secret to success?' Yup. Topgrading.

I started out with two ideas. The first idea was that organizational transformation must look and feel a lot like personal transformation. The second idea was that the values held by successful companies must be similar to the values held by successful individuals. These two ideas led me on a journey of discovery that gladdened my heart...This book...provides a road map and tools for those who want to travel the same path&quot; (from the Foreward).<br />In this context, Richard Barrett, in Chapter 11, shows a comprehensive framework for building a visionary organization. Here, he defines a visionary organization as a long-living, successful organization that cares about its employees, its customers, the local community, the environment, and a society at large. According to him, visionary organizations take social responsibility very seriously, and they display six important characteristics:<br />1. They have strong, positive, values-driven cultures.<br />2. They make a lasting commitment to learning and self-renewal.<br />3. They are continually adapting themselves based on feedback from internal and external environments.<br />4. They make strategic alliances with internal and external partners, customers, and suppliers.<br />5. They are willing to take risk and experiment.<br />6. They have a balanced values-based approach to measuring performance that includes such factors as corporate survival (financial results), corporate fitness (efficiency, productivity, and quality), collaboration with suppliers and customers, continuous learning and self-development (corporate evolution), organizational cohesion and employee fulfillment (corporate culture), and corporate contribution to the local community and society.<br />Hence, he develops a three-phase process for building a visionary organization: (1) preparation, (2) implementation, and (3) maintaining an evolutionary culture.<br />Finally, during the process of building a visionary organization, he writes that &quot;the critical factors in successful transformations are (a) the management team's commitment to modeling the new values and behaviors; (b) integrating the new values into the structural incentives of the human resource processes of the organization; (c) building psychological ownership by involving employees in defining the missiom, vision, and values and the Balanced Needs Scorecard objectives and targets; (d) helping employees to think like owners; and (e) assigning responsibilities and developing structural mechanisms to support innovation, learning, and cultural renewal.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-03-25

But wanting to win is not enough: Leaders must set a path that makes it happen. A firm's path to winning must increasingly go beyond mastering balance sheets, creating new manufacturing processes, and forming customer relationships; it must build that change, learn, move, and act faster than those of its competitors. To make the best use of these organizational capabilities, executives must see their human resource practices as source of competitive advantage...The successful leaders of the future must be able to create organizational capabilities. They must be able to identify the capabilities critical to business success and to design and deliver human resource management practices that can create those capabilities. To create value and deliver results, the leaders of the future must become human resource champions...So what do these competitive challenges mean for the continuing evolution of HR? On the one hand, HR refers to the organizational systems and processes within a firm that govern how work is done...On the other hand, HR refers to the HR function or department. The new competitive realities suggest a new agenda for HR, an agenda focused on championing competitiveness. As champions of competitiveness, HR professionals must focus more on the deliverables of their work than on doing their work better. They must articulate their role in terms of value created. They must create mechanisms to deliver HR so that business results quickly follow. They must learn to measure results in terms of business competitiveness rather than employee comfort and to lead cultural transformation rather than to consolidate, reengineer, or downsize when a company needs to turn around. To achieve these goals, HR must recognize and correct its past&quot; (pp.16-17).<br />In this context, in Chapter 1, Dave Ulrich outlines old myths and new realities of HR as following:<br />I- Old Myths:<br />1. People gointo HR because they like people.<br />2. Anyone can do HR.<br />3. HR deals with the soft side of a business and is therefore not accountable.<br />4. HR focuses on costs, which must be controlled.<br />5. HR's job is to be policy police and the health-and-happiness patrol.<br />6. HR is full of fads.<br />7. HR is staffed by nice people.<br />8. HR is HR's job.<br />II- New Realities:<br />1. HR departments are not designed to provide corporate therapy or as social or health-and-happiness retreats. HR professionals must create the practices that make employees more competitive, not more comfortable.<br />2. HR activities are based on theory and research. HR professionals must master both theory and practice.<br />3. The impact of HR practices on business results can and must be measured. HR professionals must learn how to translate their work into financial performance.<br />4. HR practices must create value by increasing the intellectual capital within the firm. HR professionals must add value, not reduce costs.<br />5. The HR function does not own compliance-managers do. HR practices do not exist to make employees happy but to help them become committed. HR professionals must help managers commit employees and administer policies.<br />6. HR practices have evolved over time. HR professionals must see their current work as part of an evolutionary chain and explain their work with less jargon and more authority.<br />7. At times, HR practices should force vigorous debates. HR professionals should be confrontative and challenging as well as supportive.<br />8. HR work is as important to line managers as are finance, strategy, and other business domains. HR professionals should join with managers in championing HR issues.<br />Finally, he writes that &quot;the HR function traditionally has spent more time professing than being professional. The HR function has been plauged by myths that keep it from being professional. Regardless of whether these myths originate with HR people or with line managers, it is time they were overcome. It is time to talk less and do more; time to add value, not write value statements; time to build competitive, not comfortable, organizations; time to be proactive, not reactive. It is time to perform, not preach.&quot;<br />Strongly recommended.	2001-03-19

Many studies have been undertaken to answer this question. However, three of them stand out as being the must comprehensive: (1) the 1995-1996 Hman Resource Planning Society State-of-the-Art Study (R.Eichinger &amp; D.Ulrich); (2) the Penn State Executive Programs Management Skills Assessment-Human Resources, which was conducted between 1985 and 1997 (A.Vicere &amp; R.Prescott); (3) A 21st-Century Vision of Strategic Human Resource Management (W.Rothwell, S.Schechter &amp; S.McLane). A review of tese studies shows that the HR field is on the verge of moving beyond its recently acquired responsibilities for performance consulting and business partnering to assume strategic leadership&quot; (p.26).<br />In this context, W.J.Rothwell, P.K.Prescott, and M.W.Taylor review these studies as following:<br />I- 1995-1996 HR Planning Society State-of-the-Art Study.<br />1. Seven most essential skills for HR executives today:<br />* Business savvy and acumen<br />* Leading organizational change initiatives using personal power and indirect influence skills<br />* Deep and working knowledge of the basic HR technologies <br />* Global strategic thinking and planning skills<br />* Change management technology<br />* Analytical, conceptual, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills<br />* Financial analysis and costing skills<br />2. Seven most essential skills for HR executives in the future:<br />* Master global operating skills<br />* Business and financial savvy<br />* Strategic, visioning, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills<br />* Using information technology<br />* Deep HR technology savvy<br />* Change management skills<br />* Organizational effectiveness<br />II- Penn State Executive Program Mnagement Skills Assesment-Human Resources (1997)<br />1. Six general roles of the new HR leaders: Partner, problem solver, model manager, oracle, conduit, and change agent.<br />2. Most important competencies of the HR leader:<br />* Is committed to the success of the organization<br />* Acts consistently in a manner that instills trust<br />* Is an effective listner<br />* Exhibits high standards of performance<br />* Can manage conflict effectively<br />* Works effectively with other managers outside the HR function<br />* Recruits and selects high-quality professionals<br />* Communicates effectively both orally and in writing<br />* Understands the overall corporate mission<br />* Develops HR plans that are clearly linked to the mission and strategy of business units<br />III- A 21st-Century Vision of Strategic Human Resource Management (1995-1996): The results of the study indicate differences between the most important present and future competencies required for success by HR leaders (see pp.29-30, and Appendix 1).<br />Within this general framework, they write that &quot;taken together, these three studies provide compelling evidence that HR practitioners of the future must demonstrate exemplary leadership skills if they are to be successful. For HR practitioners, it is no longer enough to be a compliance-oriented practitioner, a supportive, or even a performance consultant. Exemplary HR practitioners of the future will be leaders who are capable of demonstrating a new value-added component to their organizations by managing and developing knowledge capital. By comparing the studies (just summarized above), we can see that six key roles for HR leaders have emerged: change agent, HR strategist, business strategist, HR functional aligner, partner to general managers, and problem solver and consultant.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-03-19

What knowledge is important? Where do we start? Should we manage the knowledge of all employees or just a select few. Which select few? Should we get everyone to document what they know? Wait a minute...if they are documenting everything they know when do they have time to do their jobs? It's a conundrum, let's not even get into whether or not it's possible to document all the types of knowledge a company must be interested in. The solution is as usual to focus; to look at the types of knowledge which are essential to the company in order to enable it to achieve its corporate goals.&quot;<br />In this context, in Chapter 3, she shows some examples of types of knowledge which can be critical in a company as following:<br />1. Knowledge of a particular job such as how to remove the wings from an aircraft or how to clean out a boiler.<br />2. Knowledge of who knows what in a company.<br />3. Knowledge of how to get things done in a company-using the culture to maximum effect.<br />4. Knowledge of who is best to perform a particular job or task.<br />5. Knowledge of corporate history, why the company works the way it does.<br />6. Knowledge of a particular customer account.<br />7. Knowledge of a geography, country and its business customs.<br />8. Knowledge of how to put together a team that can achieve a particular task.<br />9. Knowledge of how to approach a particular problem which is difficult to solve.<br />Finally, she writes about critical knowledge that &quot;it's important not to fall into a false sense of security when considering critical knowledge in the organization, as it may be the case that know-how which is important today, this month or this year is not important next year.

As someone observed, there are two kinds of companies: those who change and those who disappear...Today's economic landscape is being shaped by two powerful forces- 'technology' and 'globalization.' The technological landscape today is dotted with new products...Technology is the ultimate shaper not only of the material substructure of society, but also of human thought patterns...Technology drives the second major force, globalization...Besides technology and globalization, other forces are reshaping the economy. 'Deregulation' is occurring in many economies. Protected companies, often monopolies, suddenly confront new competitors...Another strong force is 'privatization', where former publicly held companies and agencies have been turned over to private ownership and management, in the belief that they would be better managed and more efficient...Yogi Berra, the legendary Yankee catcher, summed it up when he said, 'The future ain't what it used to be.' He might have added: 'Do you feel your company is being chased by wild animals. If not, you should!' Markets are pitiless. Jack Welch would start his management meetings with the admonishment, 'Change or die.' Richard Love of Hewlett-Packard observes: 'The pace of change is so rapid that the ability to change has now become a competitive advantage.' The ability to change requires an ability to learn. Peter Senge and others have popularized the notion of a 'learning organization.' Not surprisingly, companies such as Coca-Cola, General Electric, and Skandia have appointed vice presidents of knowledge, or learning or intellectual capital. Those vice presidents have the task of designing 'knowledge management systems' to enable rapid company learning about trends and developments affecing consumers, competitors, distributors, and suppliers&quot; (pp.3-5).<br />In thiscontext, in Chapter 1, after saying as the pace of change accelerates, companies can no longer rely on their former business practices to sustain prosperity, Philip Kotler compares busines assumptions and practices that were practiced 'then' with the ones being increasingly practiced 'now' as following:<br />I- 'Then'<br />1. Make everything inside the company.<br />2. Improve on one's own.<br />3. Go it alone.<br />4. Operate with functional departments.<br />5. Focus domestically.<br />6. Be product-centered.<br />7. Make a standard product.<br />8. Focus on the product.<br />9. Practice mass marketing.<br />10. Find a sustainable competitive advantage.<br />11. Develop new products slowly and carefully.<br />12. Use many suppliers.<br />13. Manage from the top.<br />14. Operate in the marketplace.<br />II- 'Now'<br />1. Buy more things outside (outsource).<br />2. Improve by benchmarking others.<br />3. Network with other firms, collabotate.<br />4. Manage business processes with multidiscipline teams.<br />5. Focus globally and locally.<br />6. Be market-and customer-centered.<br />7. Make adopted/or customized products.<br />8. Focus on the value chain.<br />9. Practice target marketing.<br />10. Keep inventing new advantages.<br />11. Speed up the new product development process cycle.<br />12. Use few suppliers.<br />13. Manage up and down and across.<br />14. Operate in the marketspace.<br />Finally, he writes that those in the 'now' list are viewed as more effective contemporary approaches to profitability. Your company can almost tell how much it has adopted contemporary business practices by placing a check in each list on either the 'then' or the 'now'. If most of the checks are on the 'then', your company is locked in traditional practices.<br />Strongly recommended.	2001-02-20

They will need to learn new management strategies based on ideas about human resources that may never have occurred to them before. They will have to abandon the old corporate paradigms and accept the fact that business today is a whole new kind of ball game. And above all, they will have to find means to bring the work force as individuals, as human beings, back to the center of corporate strategy-because corporate survival in this chaotic, ever-changing, new business world of ours is going to rely crucially on the commitment, enthusiasm, talent, and creative contributions of every single employee from top to bottom of the organization&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, throughout the book Carol Kinsey Goman examines these seven steps in detail, and summarizes them and their basic principles as following:<br />1. Examine changing realities<br />* Communicate to employees the forces of change affecting markets, competition, and their jobs.<br />* Acknowledge the changes in needs and values of the work force.<br />2. Adopt the new business paradigm<br />* Identify the changing paradigm for science and organizations.<br />* Exploit instability as the opportunity for positive transformation.<br />3. Develop a change-adept work force<br />* Expand employees' skills to help them thrive on change instead of fearing it.<br />* Develop management practices that promote change-adeptness throughout the organization.<br />4. Lead discontinuous change<br />* Be prepared not just to manage but to lead transformation.<br />* Build emotional literacy in yourself and in your work force.<br />5. Develop the core of leadership<br />*  Become the change you want to see in others: Lead by example.<br />* Transform yourself from manager to leader.<br />6. Renegotiate the compact between employers and employees<br />* Recognize the powerful potential of sharedcommitment.<br />* Move from paternalizm to partnership.<br />7. Liberate work force potential<br />* Eliminate obstacles to creative collaboration.<br />* Rely on human potential as central to your corporate strategy.<br />Finally, she writes that &quot;With one exception, success in today's global economy boils down to the single, universally recognized issue of getting more for less. The exception is human resources. The potential of an organization lies within each individual and within the connections between individuals. Human labor is no longer a disposable commodity. It is a unique creative resource for the future of the organization. You can trim production costs, speed up communications, reduce delivery times, cut corners on marketing and promotion...But you can't switch workers off and expect to come out ahead. If you give people less, they give less back. If you treat them like underlings, they behave like underlings. Offer them more, on the other hand, and they'll repay you with interest. I'm not talking about money now. I'm talking about liberating untapped potential, about energizing employees and engaging their enthusiasm.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-02-06

'You don't compete with products alone anymore, but how well you use your people,' a manager at Telia, the Swedish telecommunications company, put it to me. And Linda Keegan, vice president for executive development at Citibank, told me, 'Emotional intelligence is the underlying premise for all management training'...A 1997 survey of benchmark practices among major corporations, done by the American Society for Training and Development, found that four out of five companies are trying to promote emotional intelligence in their employees through training and development, when evaluating performance, and in hiring...If so, why write this book? Because many or most organizations' efforts to encourage emotional intelligence have been poor, wasting vast amounts of time, energy, and money...My mission in writing this book is to act as a guide to the scientific case for working with emotional intelligence-as individuals, in groups, as organizations. At every step I have sought to validate the science with the testimony of people in jobs and organizations of all kinds, and their voices will be heard all along the way&quot; (pp.7-13).<br />In this context, Daniel Goleman firstly defines emotional competence as a learned capability based on emotional intelligence that results in outstanding performance at work, and emotional intelligence as a potential for learning the practical skills that are based on its elements. Thus, throughout this invaluable book, he discusses the relationship between the five dimensions of emotional intelligence and the twenty-five emotional competencies as listed below:<br />A. Personal Competence- These competencies determine how we manage ourselves.<br />I- Self-Awareness- Knowing one's internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions.<br />1. Emotional awareness: Recognizing one's emotions and their effects. <br />2. Accurate self-assessment: Knowing one's strengths and limits.<br />3. Self-confidence: A strong sense of one's self-worth and capabilities.<br />II- Self-Regulation- Managing one's internal states, impulses, and resources.<br />4. Self-control: Keeping disruptive emotions and impulses in check.<br />5. Trustworthiness: Maintaining standards of honesty and integrity.<br />6. Conscientiousness: Taking responsibility for personal performance.<br />7. Adaptability: Flexibility in handling change.<br />8. Innovation: Being comfortable with novel ideas, approaches, and new information.<br />III- Motivation- Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals.<br />9. Achievement drive: Striving to improve or meet a standard of excellence.<br />10. Commitment: Aligning with the goals of the group or organization.<br />11. Initiative: Readiness to act on opportunities.<br />12. Optimism: Persistence in pursuing goals despite obstacles and setbacks.<br />B- Social Competence- These competencies determine how we handle relationships.<br />IV- Empathy- Awareness of others' feelings, needs, and concerns.<br />13. Understanding others: Sensing others' feelings, and perspectives, and taking an active interest in their concerns.<br />14. Developing others: Sensing others' development needs and bolstering their abilities.<br />15. Service orientation: Anticipating, recognizing, and meeting customers' needs.<br />16. Leveraging diversity: Cultivating opportunities through different kinds of people.<br />17. Political awareness: Reading a group's emotional currents and power relationships.<br />V- Social Skills- Adeptness of inducing desirable responses in others.<br />18. Influence: Wielding effective tactics for persuasion.<br />19. Communication: Listening openly and sending convincing messages.<br />20. Conflict management: Negotiating and resolving disagreements.<br />21. Leadership: Inspiring and guiding individuals and groups.<br />22. Change catalyst: Initiating or managing change.<br />23. Building bonds: Nurturing instrumental relationships.<br />24. Collaboration and cooperation: Working with others toward shared goals.<br />25. Team capabilities: Creating group synergy in pursuing collective goals.<br />Daniel Goleman writes that &quot;this list offers a way to inventory our strengths and to pinpoint competencies we may want to bolster. Part 2 and 3 of the book give more detail and insight into each of the competencies, showing how they look when displayed in full power-or when they are lacking. Readers may want to turn directly to the competencies most relevant to their interests; the chapters describing them do build on one another to an extent (as do the competencies they describe), but they need not be read in a fixed order.&quot;<br />Strongly recommended.	2001-01-26

At the same time, we see much younger corporations such as Compaq, Wal-Mart, Intel, and Microsoft competing with them and thriving. How did these successful giants of the 1960s and 1970s end up with major competitiveness problems in the 1980s and 1990s? The answer is both simple and extraordinarily complex. These once very successful corporations remained good at operating well-managed, bottom-line-oriented hierarchies, and as a result they continued to make small improvements in performance. Their fiercest competitors, on the other hand-often other U.S. companies-were, and still are, redefining the rules for business success and achieving dramatic improvements in their performance. Until recently, many of these formerly very successful companies have stubbornly clung to the old ways of doing things and refused to accept that a new era of management thinking what I call the 'new logic' of organizing-is beginning. As a result, the IBMs, Westinghouses, and Sears Roebucks of the world are behind in the race to reinvent themselves and the way they are managed&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, Edward E. Lawler III firstly outlines and contrasts the most important assumptions and elements of both the traditional logic and the new logic appproach as following:<br />I- The Six Old Logic Principles:<br />1. Organization is a secondary source of competitive advantage.<br />2. Bureaucracy is the most effective source of control.<br />3. Top management and technical experts should add most of the value.<br />4. Hierarchical processes are the key to organizational effectiveness.<br />5. Organizations should be designed around functions.<br />6. Effective managers are the key to organizational effectiveness.<br />II- The Six New Logic Principles:<br />1. Organization can be the ultimate competitive advantage.<br />2. Involvement is the most effective source of control.<br />3. All employees must add significant value.<br />4. Lateral processes are the key to organizational effectiveness.<br />5. Organizations should be designed around products and customers.<br />6. Effective leadership is the key to organizational effectiveness.<br />Then, after introducing a new way of organizing and managing based on the new logic principles, he focuses on applying the six principles to the organizational elements in order to create a high-performance organization within the context of the Star Model-it has a pentagonal shape with a five-pointed star inside. It depicts the key features of an organization: strategy, structure, rewards, processes, and people.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-01-26

Allaire of Xerox	&quot;Successful corporate transformation depends on effective decision making and leadership from three distinct but inter coonected entities: the CEO, the top management team, and the board of directors. The CEO is the executive who has overall responsibility for the conduct and performance of the firm; clearly his or her mindset, imagination, and behavior will have a defining effect on corporate adaptation. Ultimately, however, senior leadership is a shared endeavor, extending beyond the CEO to other top executives. Thus, the senior management group, widely referred to as the top management team, also has a central role in formulating and executing corporate transformation. The top management team is not simply an aggregation of individual executives. Rather, the dynamics and complementarities that exist within the team greatly influence corporate outcomes. Finally, the board of directors has legal responsibility for the governance of the firm...All three of these leadership entities are critically important to effective corporate adaptation under conditions of turbulence. This book examines all three, including their interconnections to one another and, particularly, their roles in designing and navigating effective corpotate change&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, in Chapter 6, Paul A. Allaire, chairman and CEO of Xerox Corporation, discusses in depth the role of the senior management team in bringing about a major transformation at his company. He argues that &quot;Effective teamwork harnesses creativity and unleashes brain power; it leads to better solutions, better decisions, and improved business results through more effective implementation.&quot; In this invaluable article, after describing the centrality of teamwork at Xerox, and teamwork at the CEO level-the top management team, he concludes with some lessons from experience on what works and what doesn't work as following:<br />* Self-managed senior teams don't work.<br />* Remotely located teams work less well than teams in physical proximity.<br />* Laissez-faire or consensus leadership doesn't work.<br />* Ill-defned team objectives, processes, and rewards hamper performance.<br />* Teamwork starts with the CEO.<br />* Total Quality Management tools and processes can enhance teamwork.<br />* Roles, responsibilities, and expectations must be clarified.<br />* An effective governance process must be in place.<br />* Outside counsel and assistance helps.<br />* Teams need to be explicitly launched and then maintained over time.<br />Finally, Allaire writes that &quot;Those are my insights on teams at the senioe executive level. I should also point out that there is no free lunch. No matter how deep your commitment, teamwork does have some negative aspects. Teams are time-consuming. You utilize more of the time and energy of top management than if you dictate a solution or a direction. You also run the risk that a tendency toward groupthink may develop...Continuous improvement means a continuous team approach to solving problems and staying on the right course. Team members need to know how valuable their contribution is. That's why at Xerox we not only teach teamwork, we celebrate it.&quot;<br />Strongly recommended.	2001-01-26

William E. Halal, editor, writes, &quot;This book brings together the views of prominent leaders in the trenches of the Information Revolution to examine the revolutionary new principles for managing knowledge. Here's a quick overview of these confusing but exciting management heresies.<br />Principle 1: 'Complexity Is Managed Through Freedom': Success is no longer achieved by planning and control-but through entrepreneurial freedom among people at the bottom.<br />Principle 2: 'Cooperation Is Economically Efficient': Economic strength does not come from power and firmness-but out of the cooperative flow of information within a corporate community.<br />Principle 3: 'Progress Is Guided by Knowledge and Spirit': Abundance is not the result of material riches-but of understanding the subtle workings of an infinitely complex world.<br />There are the new laws governing institutions today, the economic imperatives that determine who succeeds and who fails, the keys to pioneering an unexplored frontier of boundless knowledge-The Infinite Resource&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, Halal organizes this invaluable collection into three parts that each focuses on the principles outlined as below:<br />1. Halal writes, &quot;Part I shows that today's hierarchical structures are being replaced by an emerging foundation of management based on enterprise. The complexity of a knowledge era has made our old command-and-control systems obsolete, and so entrepreneurial freedom is now crucial, not only in economic systems but also to permit free enterprise in organizational systems.&quot; Thus, authors of this part, S.Goldsmith, R.L.Ackoff, J.P.Starr, W.Gable, and M.Lehrer mainly focus on decentralized structures, self-supporting units, entrepreneurial freedom, internal competition, and accountability to clients.<br />2. Halal writes, &quot;Part II illustrates how entrepreneurial organizations must also use cooperation to form collaborative communities. Knowledge differs from physical resources because it increases when shared, making collaborative working relations productive not only in strategic alliances but between buyer and seller, employee and employer, business and goverment, and other stakeholders.&quot; Thus, authors of this part, G.H.Taylor, R.E.Miles, J.Lipnack and J.Stamps, T.Holbrooke, and R.Oklewize mainly focus on virtues of teamwork, networking among internal units, shared knowledge, spherical organization, collaborative alliances, and corporate communities.<br />3. Halal writes, &quot;Part III descibes the intelligent infrastructures now being built to guide this corporate community in creating powerful forms of knowledge.&quot; Thus, authors of this part, R.W.Smith, D.Walters, M.Malone, G. and E.Pinchot, R.Kuperman, and W.A.Owens mainly focus on global information networks, free flow of information, knowledge society, employee training, virtual organizations, strategic direction, and vision.<br />Finally, Halal writes that &quot;the message my colleagues and I want to stress is that the world is entering such an uncharted new frontier, an epoch so fundamentally different that the old rules no longer apply. The conventional wisdom of the past must be replaced by concepts that conform with the new realities of infinite knowledge:<br />* Order can be best achieved-not through control and planning-but through entrepreneurial freedom.<br />* Strength comes-not out of power and firmness-but through cooperative community.<br />* Abundance flows out of-not material riches-but a subtle frontier of boundless understanding, meaning, and spirit.&quot;<br />Strongly recommended.	2001-01-22

There are many excellent books about knowledge management..., but we think our book is unique. Here's why: First,...It's a book about how to improve the performance of your organization...Second, this book is not based on theories or speculation. It is anchored in successes, mistakes, and real-life case studies. It is not a spiritual guide or a technology manual. The experiences, thoughts, insights, and conclusions herein are based on surveys, site visits, and design work with over seventy organizations of all shapes ans sizes...This book is primarily about internal transfer of best practices in organizations. That is, the transfer of best practices from one part of an organization to another part-or parts-in order to increase profitability or effectiveness...Finally, it is also a book about the transfer of knowledge, specifically, the effective management of knowledge inside an organization...This book will focus largely on 'internal benchmarking'-looking inside your own organization-and transferring best practices&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, Carla O'Dell and C.Jackson Grayson,Jr., in Chapter 4, write that &quot;the internal transfer of knowledge is about finding out what you know, and using it to improve performance. It is about leveraging the value of knowledge you've already got. Whereas different companies adopt different approaches to finding and sharing internal know-how, they all seem to pursue one single strategy with great vigor: the transfer of internal best pactices&quot;, and then lay out a model that will guide the rest of the book. It has three major components:<br />1. The three value propositions- Companies must transfer knowledge and best practices to create value, and value is created by translating knowledge into action. But exactly what 'value' are we talking about? Thus, the first step toward profitable management of your company's knowledge asset is choosing the right value proposition.<br />* Customer intimacy- Increase revenue, reduce cost of selling, and increase customer satisfaction and retention.<br />* Product-to-market excellence- By reducing time-to-market, and designing and commercializing new products more quickly and successfully, we will increase revenue, retain market lead, and grow our profit margins.<br />* Operational excellence- Boost revenue by reducing the cost of production and increasing productivity, and raise performance to new highs.<br />2. The four enablers- The second step is creating the most supportive environment for transfer, by designing and aligning the enablers of transfer: culture, technology, infrastructure, and measurement.<br />3. The four-phase change process- The third step is change process would likely follow the following four phases: plan, design, implement, and scale-up.<br />Finally, they write that &quot;Sure, companies have embarked on change efforts before. This one is diffrent. It's different because the improvement work is anchored in real-life practical knowledge-the know-how and intelligence other people within your own company have developed and used. It has worked for others. It can work for you. The key for making this work is threefold:<br />1. You've got to have a clearly defined purpose: the value proposition.<br />2. You've got to understand and leverage various organizational enablers, from infrastructure to technology, from measurement to culture.<br />3. You've got to have an organized way for achieving it: the four-phase process.<br />The reminder of this book is about these three components and the companies that illustrate their effective use.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-01-19

This creed simply stated that we would build a successful business by focusing on the customer, encouraging entrepreneurial spirit, empowering everyone, and sharing both success and failure. We call this culture an ownership culture. We discovered that this environment was enjoyable to work in and was a powerfull strategy...To this day, when we ask people associated with the company why it was successful, and why they were committed, the answer is always the same. It was empowerment; it was team-spirit; it was vision. It was mutual respect and trust. Most important, it was the culture...This book is a distillation of our experience in creating, nurturing, and maintaining an ownership culture...The ALO model is a synthesis and practical application of leading business concepts along with our own personal experiences...The ALO model is not academic theory, it's a roadmap for applying today's most important management practices to the real-world problem of building an information-era business...In this book, we present the internal franchise, the foundation of ALO and a framework for unlocking entrepreneurial spirit in your organization...The heart of the internal franchise is the ownership culture, a corporate culture built on the principles and values of the entrepreneur. An ownership culture compels everyone in your organization to think and act like an owner of the business&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, Robert Blonchek and Martin O'Neill divide their book into three parts:<br />I. In this part, they present the internal franchise as a framework for putting ownership culture to work as a competitive weapon. According to them an internal franchise consists of three components: an operating model, entrepreneurial employees, and an ownership culture. They argue that &quot;An internal franchise is similar to a traditional franchise operation. In an internal franchise the company makes its operating model explicit and then 'franchises' the operating model to its employees. The employees are then coached, mentored, and trained to operate the business at the highest level of proficiency. In an internal franchise, the franchise agreement is not a legal binding contract, it is the company's culture-an ownership culture.&quot;<br />II. In this part, they present a formula for creating an ownership culture. They argue that an ownership culture is a corporate culture based on TRUST:<br />* Teach your employees your operating model.<br />* Reward them based on the performance of the business and their contribution to that performance.<br />* Unconditionally support their actions in order to develop a truly empowering environment.<br />* Share information so that everyone can make effective business decisions.<br />* Be Trustworthy by making and keeping commitments.<br />III. In this part, they apply an ownership culture to one of the most pressing problems facing business today: attracting and retaining skilled workers. They argue that &quot;Without a doubt, attracting to talent is a key business challenge for most organizations. But that's only half the problem-changing employee attitudes and expectations make it difficult to hold on to talented workers as well. In fact, the loss of talented workers forces many companies to reduce their growth projections and negatively affects their ability to compete.&quot;<br />Finally, they write, &quot;It's time for the grand finale in the drama of twentieth-century business. It's financial capital versus human capital, and we'll soon know who wins. But all indications are that the winning businesses in the next century will be those that understand how to mobilize human intellect and ingenuity for competitive advantage. Adopting the principle presented in Act Like an Owner is the best way to ensure that you end up on the side of the winners.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2001-01-19

First, we believe in people. In our view, people are the real competitive advantage of any company. Having good people decreases turnover, improves individual performance, attracts a flow of new applicants, and fosters growth in organizational profit...Second, we believe in corporate culture. Employees can find a job anywhere, but they commit to and want to remain with an organization whose culture they connect with...Third, we believe the organizations most successful in their staffing and retention practices are those that leverage their core culture to attract and retain like-valued employees. Although job fit is important, culture fit determines whether someone is highly likely to remain with and be successful with the company...Fourth, we believe in a strategic, more than tactical, approach to finding and keeping great employees...Fifth, we believe in simple, doable concepts and guidance, rather than rambling, esoteric prose...Sixth, we believe that any attempt to find and keep great employees must be flexible...Finally, we believe that this book can make a significant difference in organizations-a difference in performance, in productivity, and in profitability&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, Jim Harris and Joan Brannick, in Chapter 2, focus on culture. They argue that aligned companies base their staffing and retention processes upon one of four forms of core culture:<br />1. Customer Service- The underlying purpose of a customer-service culture is to create customer solutions (more detailed discussion see Chapter 3).  <br />2. Innovation- The underlying purpose of an innovation culture is to create the future (more detailed discussion see Chapter 4).<br />3. Operational Excellence- The underlying purpose of an operationally excellent culture is to create a process that minimizes costs while maximizing productivity and efficiency (more detailed discussion see Chapter 5).<br />4. Spirit- Theunderlying purpose of a culture of spirit is to create an environment that inspires employee excellence (more detailed discussion see Chapter 6).<br />They write that &quot;the four core cultures are separate but equal. No one core culture is superior to another. None is more likely to quarantee outstanding financial performance than another. All are equally powerfull in driving long-term organizational success&quot;, and argue that &quot;the key to finding and keeping excellent employees is to align your staffing and retention to the one core culture that best propels your company's succes&quot;. Then they list the benefits of alignment as following:<br />* Alignment is strategic.<br />* Alignment is simplifies the staffing and retention process.<br />* Alignment strengthens the core culture.<br />* Alignment builds strong company connections.<br />* Alignment builds strong job connections.<br />* Alignment builds strong personal connections.<br />* The ultimate benefit is a unique competitive advantage: the ability to consistently find and keep to talent.<br />Finally, they define three steps to the process of alignment as following:<br />1. The organization must clearly understand how each core culture uniquely contributes to employee connectedness.<br />2. The organization must embrace one core culture as its operational driver.<br />3. Management must then align all staffing and retention strategies to the core culture.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-01-16

While the focus is on the reward systems that these organizations devised and implemented, the true picture goes much deeper. Each story reflects an organization that was facing a need to change the way it coducted its business and developed a process to support and reinforce change. So, the reward systems are manifestations of a new set of values and practices within organizations...The case studies in this book were developed with representatives of these organizations. They are true, real-life descriptions of what goes on inside these companies...While this book can be read from front to back, it was not written to be read in a traditional manner. It may be useful to take a non-linear approach, jumping from one section to another...This book is not intended to represent the best practices of the best companies, although it often does. It is a book about reality. It may not include the design for the perfect reward system, but it should give you ideas and approaches that will change the way you think about, develop, and manage rewards (pp.1-7).&quot;<br />In this context, Thomas B. Wilson focuses on:<br />* How does an organization such as Amazon.com instill or retain the entrepreneurial spirit that it had when it was small?<br />* how companies such as DuPont, Coca-Cola, and Cisco Systems seek to create a bridge between the requirements for success and each individual.<br />* how companies retain a customer focus so that people collaborate and strive to perform better.<br />* how companies such as DuPont, Cumming Engine, and K/P Corporation encouraged people to collaborate and provided a share of the benefit if improvements could be achieved.<br />* how companies retain their critical talents.<br />* how companies such as Allied Signal, and Harvard University Health Services have integrated a variety of quality management processes into their organizations.<br />* how companies have changed their reward systems to support new business strategies.<br />Finally, he writes that &quot;to aid you in developing your own approach to change, I have summarized the 10 key factors that seem to most accurately determine what makes reward systems successful. While this list summarizes common characteristics, the true significance is in applying these principles to your own situation and to learn from the direct application of experience.&quot;<br />1. Reward systems play a crucial role in performance.<br />2. Measures give rewards relevance; rewards give measures meaning.<br />3. Alignment and consistency are essential.<br />4. How people are paid is often more important than how much they are paid.<br />5. Build programs with a vision, and then improve them over time.<br />6. The value of the reward should exceed the cost.<br />7. The program begins after the first payouts.<br />8. Translate measures into action.<br />9. Make rewards meaningful.<br />10. Take a strategic, systemic, and holistic approach.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-01-16
US	52327458	R5WJICG87G6SY	156052488X	750566107	A New Vision for Human Resources: Crisp Management Library	Books	5	52	54	N	N	The HR Star.	&quot;In business we've stopped talking about personnel administration or even human resources management. Now we are dealing with the management of human capital...and human resources is right in the middle of it. It is no longer a cliche to say that people are the most important asset of an organization. People are the only dynamic asset. People are the causal force. Nothing happens without people. The human resources department's role is to help people be more effective in their work, as well as more satisfied. This effectiveness imperative is not measured in a flurry of programs. It is found in business results&quot; (pp.1-2).<br />In this context, in Chapter VII, Jac Fitz-enz and Jack Phillips write that &quot;As companies adjust to the new forces of the twenty-first century, HR has to find a basic model for staying in alignment with its customers. In times of great flux and uncertainty, the best approach is usually the simplest and closest to bedrock management. Basically, the human resources function has five responsibilities: planning, staffing, paying, developing and retaining human capital.&quot; Thus, in order to reveal interdependence among these functions, they introduce the HR Star model as following:<br />1. Workforce Planning- WFP is making a comeback. No matter what size your organization is, you have to look ahead to your future skills profile. If you devote a reasonable amount of time to planning, you will have it returned in reduced hiring time and cost, lower training costs of new employees, and probably higher productivity through a more stable and motivated workforce.<br />2. Staffing- Hiring during periods of sustained high growth becomes an all-consuming task. The only thing that will make it easier is having good data on the results of your current practices. Doesn't it make sense that if you know how much it costs, how long it takes, and the quality and availability of each of your major sources, you can do a better job?<br />3. Paying- Pay covers wages, salaries and benefits-the total cash investment in human assets. We can do a better job of managing that investment if we look at it from a resource viewpoint.<br />4. Developing- Employee development is no longer an option. Basic skills, management competencies and executive development are all priorities. If we don't develop effective leaders, we won't have to worry about basic skills because we will be out of business.<br />5. Retaining- When the supply is limited, a wise strategy is to pay attention to keeping what you have. Consider what it costs to lose a skilled employee: the direct cost of termination, hiring a replacement, vacancy costs and learning curve loss. These add up to more than one year's pay and benefits for an exempt person. Add to that the external costs in unhappy and lost customers, and the number goes out of sight. One study claims that the cost of losing an effective salesperson can take up to three years to recover.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-11-14

New developments in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology promise that some of the deadliest and most disabling diseases may be cured or at least better managed. New information technologies promise not only to connect us globally and to create whole new forms of commerce but also to foster peace and expand the reaches of our educational systems. Fledgling democratic movements promise to free people from centuries of tyranny and fear. But what is a promise without hope-hope that these promises will be kept? Bold leadership is required if we are to keep these hopes alive...Encouraging the Heart is ultimately about keeping hope alive. Leaders keep hope alive when they set high standards and genuinely express optimism about an individual's capacity to achieve them. They keep hope alive when they give feedback and publicly recognize a job well done. They keep hope alive when they give their constituents the internal support that all human beings need to feel that they and their work are important and have meaning. They keep hope alive when they train and coach people to exceed their current capacities. Most important, leaders keep hope alive when they set an example. There really is nothing more encouraging than to see our leaders practice what they preach&quot; (from the Introduction).<br />In this context, James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner identify seven essentials to encouraging the heart. According to Kouzes and Posner, when leaders do their best to encourage the heart, they:<br />1. Set clear standards- The first prerequisite for encouraging the heart is to set clear standards (goals and values or principles). To be successful in encouraging the heart, it's absolutely critical that everyone cherish a common set of standards. It's certainly not very encouraging to be in the dark about what we're expected to achieve, or never to know where we stand relative to what's important. Only when we know the standards can we set our sights for success. <br />2. Expect the best- High expectations or low expectations both influence other people's performance. Only high expectations have a positive impact on actions and on feelings about oneself. Thus, passionately believing in people and expecting the best of them is another prerequisite to encouraging the heart.<br />3. Pay attention- One way of showing you care is to pay attention to people, to what they're doing, and to how they're feeling. If you are clear about the standards of behavior you're looking for and you believe and expect that people will perform like winners, then you're going to notice lots of examples of people doing things right, and doing the right things.<br />4. Personalize recognition- Before recognizing someone, the best leaders get to know people personally. They learn about their likes and dislikes, their needs and interests. They observe them in their own settings. Then, when it comes time to recognize a particular person, they know a way to make it special, meaningful, and memorable.<br />5. Tell the story- Although the live example is the most powerful of ways to publicize what people do to exemplify values, there are other media available to leaders. Newsletters, annual reports, advertisement, even voice mail and e-mail can be used to encourage the heart and teach positive stories about what people do to exemplify our values. These media sure are a lot more powerful than posting our values on a wall somewhere.<br />6. Celebrate together- Public ceremonies bring people closer together. As we move to a more virtual world, where communication is by voice mail, e-mail, cell phone, videoconference, and pager, it's becoming ever more difficult for people to find opportunities to be together. We are social animals, and we need each other. Those who are fortunate enough to have lots of social support are healtier human beings than those who have a little. Social support is absolutely essential to our well-being andto our productivity. Celebrating together is one way we can get this essential support.<br />7. Set the example- Setting the example for encouraging the heart starts by giving youself permission to do so. It starts with putting it in your daily planner. It starts with putting a sign by your door. It starts when you talk to everyone about it. It starts when you turn a routine task into something fun. It starts by giving to others first. It starts when you get personally involved. When leaders do get personally involved in encouraging the heart, the results are always the same: the receiver and the giver both feel uplifted. The reflection in the mirror is the one you portray.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-11-14

If you want to be the type of leader or professional who helps your organization adapt to the multiple demands of an increasingly turbulent world, you need to become aware of the images and assumptions that are shaping your current thinking and develop the capacity to use new ones. You need to develop competencies that allow you to see, understand, and shape situations in new ways. That is the focus of Images of Organization.It is not a 'quick fix' book. It is not a book that offers a simple recipe for tackling organizational problems...The basic thesis underlying the book is a very simple one: that all organization and management theory and practice is based on images, or metaphors, that lead us to understand situations in powerful yet partial ways. When we realize this, we learn to recognize that our favored ways of managing and organizing often lead us to miss out on other ways of managing and organizing. In addition, we recognize that since every metaphor has limitations as well as strengths, we must always be aware of the inherent blind spots that inevitably undermine our effectiveness&quot; (pp.3-4).<br />In this context, Garet Morgan divides his book into three parts.<br />I- In this part, he focuses on the nature of metaphor and its role in understanding organization and management. Here, he argues that using multiple metaphors to understand organization and management gives us a capacity to tap different dimentions of a situation, showing how different qualities of organization can co-exist, supporting, reinforcing, or contradicting one another:<br />* In approaching the same situation in different ways, metaphors extend insight and suggest actions that may not have been possible before.<br />* The insights generated by different metaphors are not just theoretical. They are incredibly practical.<br />* Metaphors lead to new metaphors, creating a mosaic of competing and complementary insights.<br />II- In this part, he demonstrates how metaphor can be used to develop theories of organization and management. In this sense, he shows strengths and limitations of the following metaphors:machine metaphor, organismic metaphor, brain metaphor, culture metaphor, political metaphor, psychic prison metaphor, flux and transformation metaphor, and dominant metaphor.<br />III- In this part, by using theoretical ideas/metaphors, he presents a practical case study that illustrates how we can use the metaphors presented in this book as practical frameworks for reading and shaping organizations.<br />Finally, he argues that Images of Organization is very different from most management books. It has a clear point of view: that metaphor is central to the way we read, understand, and shape organizational life. But at no point will you find that view being brought down to advocacy of a single perspective. There are no right or wrong theories in management in an absolute sense, for every theory illuminates and hides.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-11-08

Drucker writes in the Introduction, &quot;...this is not a book of 'predictions,' not a book about the 'future.' The challenges and issues discussed in it are already with us in every one of the developed countries and in most of the emerging ones (e.g., Korea or Turkey). They can already be identified, discussed, analyzed and prescribed for. Some people, someplace, are already working on them. But so far very few organizations do, and very few executives. Those who do work on these challenges today, and thus prepare themselves and their institutions for the new challenges, will be the leaders and dominate tomorrow. Those who wait until these challenges have indeed become 'hot' issues are likely to fall behind, perhaps never to recover. This book is thus a Call for Action.&quot;<br />In this context, in Chapter 5 of this invaluable book, Drucker focuses on knowledge worker. He says that &quot;the most important, and indeed the truly unique, contribution of management in the 20th century was the fifty-fold increase in the productivity of the 'manual worker' in manufacturing. The most important contribution management needs to make in the 21st century is similarly to increase the productivity of 'knowledge work' and the 'knowledge worker.' The most valuable assets of a 20th-century company were its production equipment. The most valuable asset of a 21st-century institution, whether business or nonbusiness, will be its knowledge workers and their productivity.&quot;<br />Thus, he defines six major factors determine knowledge worker productivity as follows:<br />1. Knowledge worker productivity demands that we ask the question: &quot;What is the task?&quot;<br />2. It demands that we impose the responsibility for their productivity on the individual knowledge workers themselves. Knowledge workers have to manage themselves. They have to have authonomy.<br />3. Continuing innovation has to be part of the work, the task and the responsibility of knowledge workers.<br />4. Knowledge work requires continuous learning on the part of the knowledge worker, but equally continuous teaching on the part of the knowledge worker.<br />5. Productivity of the knowledge worker is not-at least not primarily-a matter of the quantity of output. Quality is at least as important.<br />6. Finally, knowledge worker productivity requires that the knowledge worker is both seen and treated as an &quot;asset&quot; rather than a &quot;cost.&quot; It requires that knowledge workers want to work for the organization in preference to all other opportunities.<br />He argues that each of these requirements-except perhaps the last one-is almost the exact opposite of what is needed to increase the productivity of the manual worker.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-11-06
US	52327458	R3I3SFLL1Y1V43	0875847471	294658818	Leading Change	Books	5	245	267	N	N	&quot;The Eight Steps to Transformation&quot;	&quot;Over the past decade,&quot; John P. Kotter writes, &quot;I have watched more than a hundred companies try to remake themselves into significantly better competitors. They have included large organizations (Ford) and small ones (Landmark Communications), companies based in United States (General Motors) and elsewhere (British Airways), corporations that were on their knees (Eastern Airlines), and companies that were earning good money (Bristol-Myers Squibb). Their efforts have gone under many banners: total quality management, reengineering, right-sizing, restructuring, cultural change, and turnaround. But in almost every case the basic goal has been the same: to make fundamental changes in how business is conducted in order to help cope with a new, more challenging market environment. A few of these corporate change efforts have been very successful. A few have been utter failures. Most fall somewhere in between, with a distinct tilt toward the lower end of the scale. The lessons that can be drawn are interesting and will probably be relevant to even more organizations in the increasingly competitive business environment of the coming decade.&quot;<br />In this context, John P. Kotter lists the most general lessons to be learned from both (I) the more successful cases and (II) the critical mistakes as follows:<br />I. Lessons from the more successful cases:<br />1. Establishing a sense of urgency<br />* Examining market and competitive realities<br />* Identifying and discursing crises, potential crises, or major opportunities<br />2. Forming a powerful guiding coalition<br />* Assembling a group with enough power to lead the change effort<br />* Encouraging the group to work together as a team<br />3. Creating a vision<br />* Creating a vision to help direct the change effort<br />* Developing strategies for achieving that vision<br />4. Communicating vision<br />* Using every vehicle possible to communicate the new vision and strategies<br />* Teaching new behaviors by the example of the guiding coalition<br />5. Empowering others to act on the vision<br />* Getting rid of obstancles to change<br />* Changing systems or structures that seriously undermine the vision<br />* Encouraging risk taking and nontraditional ideas, activities, and actions<br />6. Planning for and creating short-term wins<br />* Planning for visible performance improvements<br />* Creating those improvements<br />* Recognizing and rewarding employees involved in the improvements<br />7. Consolidating improvements and producing still more change<br />* Using increased credibility to change systems, structures, and policies that don't fit the vision<br />* Hiring, promoting, and developing employees who can implement the vision<br />* Reinvigorating the process with new projects, themes, and change agents<br />8.Institutionalizing new approaches<br />* Articulating the connections between the new behaviors and corporate success<br />* Developing the means to ensure leadership development and succession<br />II. Lessons from the critical mistakes: <br />1. Not establishing enough sense of urgency - A transformation program requires the aggressive cooperation of many individuals. Without motivation, people won't help and the effort goes nowhere.<br />2. Not creating a powerful guiding coalition - Companies that fail in this phase usually underestimate the difficulties of producing change and thus the importance of a powerful quiding coalition.<br />3. Lacking a vision - Without a sensible vision, a transformation effort can easily dissolve into a list of confusing and incompatible projects that can take the organization in the wrong direction or nowhere at all.<br />4. Undercommunicating the vision - Transformation is impossible unless hundreds or thousands of people are willing to help, often to the point of making short-term sacrifices.<br />5. Not removing obstacles to the new vision - Sometimes the obstacle is the organizational structure: narrowjob categories can seriously undermine efforts to increase productivity or make it very difficult even to think about customers. Sometimes compensation or performance-appraisal systems make people choose between the new vision and their own self-interest. Perhaps worst of all are bosses who refuse to change and who make demands that are inconsistent with the overall effort. <br />6. Not systematically planning and creating short-term wins - Creating short-term wins is different from hoping for short-term wins. The latter is passive, the former active. In a successful transformation, managers actively look for ways to obtain clear performance improvements, establish goals in the yearly planning system, achieve the objectives, and reward the people involved with recognition, promotions, and even money.<br />7. Declaring victory too soon - Instead of declaring victory, leaders of successful efforts use the credibility afforded by short-term wins to tackle even bigger problems.<br />8. Not anchoring changes in the corporation's culture - Change sticks when it becomes &quot;the way we do things around here,&quot; when it seeps into the bloodstream of the corporate body. Until new behaviors are rooted in social norms and shared values, they are subject to degradation as soon as the pressure for change is removed.<br />Finally, John P. Kotter writes, &quot;There are still more mistakes that people make, but these eight are the big ones. In reality, even successful change efforts are messy and full of surprises. But just as a relatively simple vision is needed to guide people through a major change, so a vision of the change process can reduce the error rate. And fewer errors can spell the difference between success and failure.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.	2000-10-23
US	52327458	R2L4RI65X5O65O	0071354816	613055398	The GE Way Fieldbook: Jack Welch's Battle Plan for Corporate Revolution	Books	5	52	58	N	N	Lessons from the Legendary Leader.	&quot;Jack Welch is arguably the most lauded CEO in the world...Such leading magazines as Time, Fortune, and Business Week all lavished praise upon him. They described him at times as the best CEO in America; at times, these magazines credited GE with being the best-run company in the nation...Welch built GE into the most successful American corporation of the late twentieth century by forging and then implementing a series of business strategies that have become his trademark: Business is simple. Don't make business overly complicated. Face reality. Don't be afraid of change. Fight bureaucracy. Get boundaryless. Use the brains of your workers. Find the best ideas, inside or outside your company, and then put those ideas into practice. These strategies and others have formed the building blocks of Jack Welch's battle for corporate revolution...The Welch strategies have been described in a number of popular business books...Most of these books describe the aforementioned business strategies, and others as well, and give an excellent overview of what Welch and GE have accomplished. What The GE Way Fieldbook sets out to accomplish is not simply to explain the strategies but to offer a blueprint of how other companies can implement those strategies expeditiously and seamlessly in their own business...In contrast with the other fieldbooks, The GE Way Fieldbook is the first of its kind to focus on the inner workings and business strategies of a specific company...While we include much of the GE story throughout the book, the primary objective is to provide a road map for those wishing to implement GE's practices in their own organizations. As a result, most chapters include not only textual material but also self-assessment exercises, action steps, and internal GE documents. It is worth noting that these documents, most of which have been provided by General Electric, have never appeared in book form&quot; (pp.1-2).<br />In this context, Robert Slater divides his book into two main sections. But, in this review, I only focus on the first section as follows.<br />I. The GE Way: A Fieldbook for Corporate Revolution: In this section, he focuses on the different GE business strategies and initiatives within four learning modules.<br />1. The Leadership Module (Chapters 1-4): In this module, Slater explains:<br />* five characteristics of best quality leaders described by Jack Welch in 1997.<br />* key GE leadership ingredients-the four E:energy, energizer, edge, and execution-, and authentic leadership model of GE as refined views of Welch on leadership in 1999.<br />* advices of GE's successful executives to GE's senior and middle-level executives all around the world: <br />(1) Performance: Focus on current job performance...,<br />(2) Expertise: Become proficient in one business/technical area...,<br />(3) Ownership: Don't whine about your career...,<br />(4) Challenge and Visibility: Take the hard job...,<br />(5) Mentors/Supporters/Role Models: Broaden your base support...,<br />(6) Global Experience/Cultural Breadth: Expose yourself and family to different cultures early...,<br />* GE's assessment-360 degree feedback- and reward policy.<br />2. The Empowerment Module (Chapters 5-6): In this module, Slater explains:<br />* Welch's Work-Out model and six basic objectives of this model:<br />(1) reducing bureaucracy,<br />(2) improving organizational processes,<br />(3) empowering employees; reducing vertical boundaries,<br />(4) breaking down intra-organizational walls,<br />(5) developing formal alliances or informal relationships with customers,<br />(6) developing other extra-organizational relationships.<br />* how GE implements this Work-Out model.<br />3. The Organization Module (Chapters 7-10): In this module, by providing a series of questionnaires and other self-assessment exercises, Slater explains Welch's boundaryless organization strategy as the GE's emerging culture and the soul of GE's integrated diversity.<br />4. TheCustomer Module (Chapters 11-15): In this module, Slater presents a complete picture of GE's Six Sigma program, how it began, how it works, what impact it has had on the company, and what Jack Welch thinks about it. Welch argues that &quot;Six Sigma is the most important management training thing we've ever had. It's better than going to Harvard Business School.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this invaluable guide.	2000-10-09
US	52327458	R1POOA7XGNAH4J	0787952753	15634982	Designing the Global Corporation	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Organizations of third-generation strategies.	&quot;Most companies do not have the capabilities to institute the multidimensional organizations that are required by their strategies and necessary to serve their global customers. In one memorable conversation,...Chris Bartlett summed up the situation well, stating that companies pursue third-generation strategies using second-generation organizations staffed with first-generation human resources. When first-generation managers attempt to institute third-generation multidimentional organizations, they fail and attribute the failure to the organizational form, not to their lack of capability. They then call for a return to simple, first-generation organizations. These simple organizations will work if the companies follow first-generation strategies in clear and stable industries. However, if a company wants to enter complicated countries like China, create value for the global customer desiring solutions, and be competitive in converging industries, it must pursue a third-generation strategy. This book is intended for those who wish to design the third-generation organizations required by third-generation strategies...I believe in 'keeping it simple' but with two twists. First, I believe we should keep it simple for the customer; a company should work toward being easy to do business. Second, I believe we should keep it simple for front-line employees-those people with direct customer and product contact...The new mandate to keep it simple for customers and front-line employees makes management's job difficult and complex; how to organize in order to manage this complexity is addressed in this book...Some firms, like ABB, IBM, and Citigroup, believe that the winning companies are going to be those that can manage global complexity. It is for these firms that this book is written&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, Jay R. Galbraith:<br />* highlights some of the reasons for adopting a global organizational capability as well as some of the inherent challenges in doing so, and also spotlights some of the managerial and business-environment mind-set that can prevent these strategies from being embraced and employed to full advantage.<br />* argues that the global organizations are complex and multidimensional networks as a result of balancing many strategic factors; and then describes these factors in four categories: level of international development, amount of cross-border coordination, activity of host local institutions, and diversity of international business porfolio.<br />* argues that the level of international development-one of the strategic factors that influence how a company organizes its international operations-consists of three dimensions: the role of subsidiaries, the mode of participation in the local economy, and the proportion of assets and employees located outside the home country; and then defines the different types of competitive advantages, and focuses on the different levels of international development and how a firm changes from one level to another.<br />* argues that after exporting, the next level of international development is investment in foreign countries with a partner; and then focuses on the partnering process itself and the organizational skills-particularly the organization design.<br />* describes six tasks of geographical division: (1)transfer advantages from existing geography, (2)localize the success formula, (3)build a local business, (4)communicate with and educate the home country, (5)champion the new subsidiaries, (6)build international capabilities; and also describes the organizational design decisions involved in performing these tasks.<br />* reviews the variety of multidimensional structures chosen by companies, like Nestle, ABB, HP, and DuPont, by varying strategic factors, like fixed costs, markets, products, customers, competitors, transportability, and portfolio diversity.<br />* defines the lateral organization as an informational and decision-making process that coordinates activities whose components are located in different organizational units, and describes different types and amounts of lateral network coordination related to the strategic factors.<br />* argues that the easiest lateral organization is the informal or voluntary organization, and management's role in this self-organizing process is to create the appropriate context and remove any barriers to free-flowing contacts. In the next level, management-building on the informal networks-designs formal cross-border groups to manage shared functions, coordinate business units, and create global products; and then describes what makes the groups formal, and discusses the design issues involved in creating formal groups that coordinate across borders.<br />* discusses the factors that are creating transnational form as the last level of international development, and then elaborates organizational-design issues of this in an example.<br />* argues, the full complexity facing many companies involves simultaneously managing functions, geographies, product lines (or business units), customers, and solutions-at the very least. These companies must use multidimensional structures, with the dynamics of global business requiring that these multiple dimensions be reconfigurable. Different customers require the services of different combinations of business units and country subsidiaries; to be competitive, a company must be able to configure and reconfigure its profit centers to create value for customers. And then presents the framework for organizing around multiple dimensions, with focusing on the customer and customer solutions in cases of Citibank and IBM.<br />Finally, he writes,&quot;Regardless of whether globalization continues, stalls, or even reverses, the models described in this book should continue to guide organizing choices. The most likely new level of international development will probably be a consrtium or some type of electronic or virtual combination of local companies&quot;.<br />I highly recommend this invaluable study.	2000-10-02
US	52327458	R27808N5IZJBNC	0684832216	155130090	The Power of Corporate Kinetics:  Create the Self-Adapting, Self-Renewing, Instant-Action Enterprise	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Serve a single customer...Act in a zero time...	&quot;This book is about the death of predictability and how you can turn it to your advantage. Until now, virtually every work of management theory, as well as every business, has been based on a single premise: The future is predictable. Until now, we have forecast market trends, scheduled production, designed services, and trained employees on the assumption that we could count on a stable future expect for the occasional unexpected earthquake...We believe that the insights contained in this book will allow businesses to weather the storm of unpredictability. More than that, we believe this book will help businesses size the opportunities inherent in an unpredictable future as they constantly create new sources of competitive advantage. Our proposals aren't simply theory. They have emerged in part from our study of dozens of leading companies that have recognized the change in the business environment and have developed new ways to cope with it...We offer a model of what we call the 'kinetic enterprise,' a guide to the design of a business that can cope with the new reality. It is based on a simple yet profound insight: If we can no longer depend on our ability to predict the future, we must create a dynamic business design that can capitalize on the unpredictable, to turn it to our advantage...It is very different, in structure and behavior, from the traditional corporation...The kinetic enterprise isn't constrained by existing work processes. It is an instant-action machine, constantly changing its work and evolving its operations to address the unpredictable. What is more, it ignores traditional hierarchies and boundaries. Workers initiate and manage its activities, collaborating with one another at every level and within every area. The old command-and-control management model is defunct. Instead, a new culture motivates workers to collaborate spontaneously, make decisions, take risk, innovate, and learn&quot; (pp.15-20).<br />Within this general framework, Michael Fradette and Steve Michaud divide their book into two parts:<br />I. The Destination - In this part, they set forth the principles and attributes of the kinetic enterprise as follows:<br />* They write, &quot;The kinetic enterprise is organized around workers who initiate and execute individual, discrete, and unpredictable projects that we call events.&quot; These are basically market and customer events. According to them, these events require workers who are committed to success of the overall enterprise, rather than just their own position, department, or team. <br />* They define a market event as the work of the enterprise immediately and profitably performed to seize an unexpected market opportunity. According to them, market events aren't strategy, market forecasting, and just responses to shifting customer needs, and hence market events have the following six basic elements: (1)spotting an unexpected market opportunity, (2)assessing its impact on the enterprise, (3)deciding if the market opportunity is right for the business, (4)marshaling the resources of the enterprise to capitalize on the opportunity, (5)developing the best approach to the task, and (6)capturing insights and rolling out the idea to the enterprise.<br />* They define a customer event as the work of enterprise immediately and profitably performed to satisfy a unique, single customer demand. According to them, customer events aren't an exercise in extravagant service, dedicated to achieving customer intimacy or even a long-term relationship, micro-marketing, and mass customization, and hence customer events have the following six basic elements: (1)ascertaining a customer's specific needs, (2)assessing its impact on the enterprise, (3)deciding if if satisfying the demand is right for the enterprise, (4)marshaling the resources of the enterprise to meet the customer's demand, (5)developing and implementing the best approach to the task, and (6)satisfying the customer.<br />* They arguethat workers of a kinetic enterprise think like owners, share common goals and enterprise-wide rewards, disdain constraining job descriptions, design event teams, and learn as they go.<br />* They argue that in a kinetic enterprise, old notions of predefined jobs and roles, the hierarchical distinctions, no longer exist. Everyone in the enterprise, from CEO to assembly line workers, must be ready to play one or all of the roles such as frontline worker, strategist, stakeholder, decision-maker, manager, coach, student, champion, innovator, project member, networker, and leader at any given time.<br />II. The Journey - In this part, in order to answer to 'How should companies go about their journey toward a kinetic future?', they suggest the following five concurrent paths:<br />1. Create the new leadership - They argue that in traditional, task-based organizations, leaders are, by definition, separate and removed from their workers. Leaders are responsible for predicting market trends from year to year, developing strategies to take advantage of them, and making sure the strategies are implemented. In the kinetic enterprise, leaders still predict and implement winning plays to succeed in visible markets. But they also prepare themselves and their organization to respond to the invisible, unpredictable market shifts that have become so commonplace in the modern business world. And thus, Fradette and Michaud show five key tasks of these kinetic leaders. <br />2. Building the right workforce - They argue that in traditional companies, job interviews are concerned with the candidate's specific skills and experience. Kinetic organizations search for candidates who have innate talents rather than just track records, and their attitudes and personalities must match the corporate culture.<br />3. Design for instant action - They argue that traditional organizations build infrastructures primarily to promote productivity and efficiency, with the result that all to often theylock themselves into old ways of doing business. Kinetic enterprises, on the other hand, gear their infrastructures to a pair of outrageous goals. Work design, communications and computer systems, and even physical plants are designed to serve single customer and to act in zero time. <br />4. Ignite customer events - They argue that kinetic enterprise ignite customer events so customers can design their own relationships, create personalized products and services, invent wholly new products and services, and design total solutions.<br />5. Ignite market events - They argue that innovation with customer events isn't enough to win in today's unpredictable environment. To stay on top, workers must invent new products, services, and businesses that neither customers nor competitors have imagined.<br />Finally, they write, &quot;The primary focus of this book is more immediate and pragmatic. We have designed it to be both a spur and a guide: a spur to recognize the permanence of the changes that have torn up our business environment, and a guide to help cope with those changes. We hope that you will heed our warnings and that you will find ways to apply kinetics in your own backyard. As so many enterprises have discovered, the path of kinetics can be difficult and demanding, but the rewards are sure and plentiful.&quot;<br />Strongly recommended.	2000-09-25

In an interview in India, he said: 'More and more companies will see the need to develop this multidomestic combination for global coordination. The big American companies used to have a domestic and an international division. You cannot have an international division. In my company, the word does not exist because if you are foreign, you are foreign everywhere. The whole meaning of being domestic or foreign has lost its meaning. When I am sitting here in India, I am not an Indian citizen, but I represent an Indian company just like I represent a Spanish company when I am in Spain'...Is ABB a model for nations?...Warren Bennis says: 'The ability to align, create, and empower will characterize successful leaders well into tht twenty-first century. But there is another theme that surfaces provocatively in some of the interviews..., most notably in the remarks of Percy Barnevik of ABB. That is the emergence of federation as the structure uniquely suited to balancing the seemingly incompatible drives toward global cooperation and the putting down of deep local roots. This paradox is evident in world politics, where intense ethnic and national identities coexist with the widespread recognition that new economic and political alliances must be forged outside one's borders'...So, what are the lessons that other organizations and managers facing the challenges of globalization can learn from ABB's experience so far? We think that there are many lessons that are both explicit and implicit throughout this book. However, we asked Percy Barnevik for his views. He says: 'I do not believe that you can mechanically copy what another company has done. ABB itself has several variations on its organization and management depending on products and customers...However, there are some general principles to learn from and adapt to your own business: the need to be global-local, big-small, and decentralized-central control' &quot;(from the Introduction).<br />In this context, Kevin Barham and Claudia Heimer summarize their objectives in writing this book: document the story of the merger, ABB's growth and global expansion; catch more than a glimpse of the real story behind the company's ongoing success; raise some key questions for the future of ABB; highlight some lessons from ABB's experience for managers in other organizations facing international and global challenges. And thus they organize their book into three main parts:<br />I. The Birth of A Modern Giant - In this part, by telling the story of the two main partners-ASEA of Sweden and BBC of Switzerland, and by outlining Percy Barnevik's concepts regarding the strategy, structure, control mechanisms and people development of the newly merged/emerged company, they describe early days of ABB.<br />II. Giant Steps to the Globally Connected Corporation - In this part, by defining ABB as a 'globally connected corporation' (global and local, big and small, and radically decentralized with central reporting and control), they show the stages of global expansion.<br />III. Reaping the Harvest - In this part, they look at the organization a decade after the merger to find out how the masterplan has worked out to date and at how ABB has started to reap the harvest resulting from all the hard work it has put into building its structure and implementing its strategy. And they also focus on CEO Goran Lindahl and his priorities for ABB in the future-innovation in human resources and information technology.<br />Finally, end of this invaluable study, they list 15 giant steps to a global organization. I briefly summarize these steps as follows:<br />1. You don't need to have all the answers when trying to achieve change on such grand scale as the ABB merger.<br />2. Decentralization to profit centres around the world is the key to creating an entrepreneurial mindset.<br />3. Stay close to customers around the world during a merger to reassure them and not lose market share.<br />4. Don't delude yourself that you can forecast the future-you can only see breaks in trend lines, and you won't always see those.<br />5. Understand which parts of the business are more global and which are more local and act accordingly.<br />6. Multiculturalism is not an ethical issue, it is a practical business need.<br />7. Set challenging targets, but don't keep changing the formal organization.<br />8. Communicate, communicate, communicate to 'fire people up'-even at the risk of competitors listening.<br />9. Globalization requires transparency and connectivity accross time zones and geography.<br />10. Every manager, including the CEO, should aim to have two to three succession candidates ready at all times.<br />11. You don't necessarily need lots of global managers-not everybody has to be global-but you do require a pool of cross-culturaly capable people from which you can draw your global managers.<br />12. Results-oriented learning on the job gives management development credibility and makes line management take responsibility for developing people.<br />13. Don't assume that all your organizational values are fully applicable across the world.<br />14. Keep it practical. Concepts are only 5 per cent of the building of a global organization. Execution and the ability to engage people around the world are 95 per cent.<br />15. Long-term shareholder value is the ultimate measurement of performance in a global company.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-09-25

These are  organizations that thrive on certainty and predictability. They are  hierarchical; power emanates from the top, and control is vital at every  level. So, often, is fear. They are heavily bureaucratic and rule-bound,  and hence inflexible. They stress the single point of view, the one best  way forward. They are managed as though the part organizes the whole.  Newtonian organizations do not respond well to change. Their primary value  is efficiency. Human beings work and live in such organizations, but we  often feel like passive units of production. Our lives serve the  organizations, but the organizations serve only our utilitarian needs, and  that only so long as we conform to the organization's purposes and are  vital to the organization itself. The emphasis on control isolates these  organizations from their environments. They don't interact with or respect  those environments, including the people who work within them. It is my  purpose here to describe a wholly different kind of organization. I hope to  offer a new model for structure, leadership, and learning within  organizations that can thrive on uncertainty, can deal creatively with  rapid change, and can release the full potential of the human beings who  lead and work or live within them. Such organizations, like the human  brain, have the potential for self-organizing creativity just waiting to be  unleashed within them. This new model is based on the thinking, ideas,  language, and imagery of the new science-quantum physics, chaos and  complexity, and the latest brain science. I believe that understanding the  philosophical basis of these sciences, understanding the new paradigm from  which they emerge, is critical to rewiring the corporate brain&quot; (from  the Introduction).<br />In this context, Danah Zohar divides this invaluable  book into two parts:<br />I- Using the New Science to Rewire Corporate  Thinking. In this part,she basically:<br />* describes the uses and  limitations of traditional paradigms in business activities and other life  contexts.<br />* focuses on three kinds of thinking (serial thinking,  associative thinking, and quantum thinking) that the human brain can do,  and discusses their advantages and disadvantages.  <br />* contrasts eight key  ideas from Newtonian science/old paradigm, and their effects on business  thinking, with eight key ideas from quantum science/new paradigm and their  application to new thinking about leadership, and thus constructs a  management-leadership chart that puts the features of these two contrasting  paradigms as follows:<br />- N.certainty, Q.uncertainty<br />- N.predictability,  Q.rapid change; unpredictability<br />- N.hierarchy, Q.nonhierarchical  networks<br />- N.division of labor or function fragmentation,  Q.multifunctional and holistic (integrated effort)<br />- N.power emanates  from top or center, Q.power emanates from many interacting centers<br />-  N.employees are passive units of production, Q.employees are cocreative  partners<br />- N. single viewpoint; one best way, Q.many view points; many  ways of getting things done<br />- N.competition, Q.cooperation<br />-  N.inflexible structures; heavy on bureaucratic control, Q.responsive and  flexible structures; hands-off supervision<br />- N.efficiency, Q.meaningful  service and relationships<br />- N.top-down (reactive) operation, Q.bottom-up  (experimental) operation<br />II- Structure and Leadership of the Rewired  Corporation. In this part, she basically:<br />* discusses Western/Newtonian  and Eastern/Networked models of the self/person and organization, and then  attempts to reach a Quantum model of self and organization drawn from the  thinking of the new science. And she shows the features of these three  models as follows:  <br />- W.conflict and control, E.cooperation,  Q.dialogue<br />- W.self (the personal) wholly excluded and isolated;  interactions grounded in universal principles, E.self wholly embedded and  contextual; no universal principles, Q.self embedded and contextual with  universal dimension<br />- W.stability achieved through excluding the self and  the emotions, and organizing only the predictable and controllable aspects  of relationships, E.stability achieved through reinforced familiarity and  discipline of the self, Q.stability balanced with instability<br />- W.rigid  boundaries, E.ambiguous boundaries, Q.flexible boundaries<br />- W.dictatorial  leadership, E.consensual leadership, Q.leader relies on trust and feel for  situation<br />- W.rule-bound, E.habit-bound, Q.no set framework from rules or  habits<br />- W.mechanical, E.organic, Q.both naturally unfolding (organic)  and that which can be made from it (mechanical)<br />- W+E.rely on stability,  Q.open to change<br />- W+E.weak in dealing with unexpected change, Q.open to  change<br />- W+E.seek to dampen down or exclude the unexpected, Q.thrives on  unexpected <br />* argues that servant leadership is the essence of quantum  thinking and quantum leadership, and then presents a new model of servant  leadership.<br />Finally, she writes, &quot;much of the book contrasts the  Newtonian and new sciene, or quantum, approaches to leadership. But this is  not to convey a message of either-or. All the fundamental thinking of the  new science is about both-and. The new science incorporates the old.  Quantum physics does not invalidate Newtonian physics. It just shows that  Newton's laws are restricted to one band of reality. But they are still  necessary to corporate leadership as the new paradigm, quantum thinking.  The core competence I hope to convey in this book is about 'managing at the  edge' - that is, becoming aware that there are different paradigms and  cultivating the judgement to know when to use one or another, or when to  remain at the edge between the two.&quot;<br />I higly recommend this unique  study.	2000-09-05
US	52327458	R3CY7JHDCEPOKS	1578511895	755092249	Leading the Revolution	Books	5	83	100	N	N	A radical new business model.	&quot;This is a book about innovation-not in the usual sense of new  products and new technologies, but in the sense of radical new business  models. It begins by laying out the revolutionary imperative: we've reached  the end of incrementalism, and only those companies that are capable of  creating industry revolutions will prosper in the new economy. It then  provides a detailed blue print of what you can do to get the revolution  started in your own company. Finally, it describes in detail an agenda for  making innovation as ubiquitous a capability as quality or customer  service. Indeed, my central argument is that radical innovation is the  competitive advantage for the new millennium&quot;(from the  Preface).<br />Within this general framework, in Chapter 3, Gary Hamel writes,  &quot;In the new economy, the unit of analysis for innovation is not a  product or a technology-it's a business concept...I doubt you can find a  dozen individuals in your company who share a common definition of your  company's existing business concept. How could they if they can't even  identify the elements of a business concept? Though consultants talk  incessantly about 'business models,' I've never met one who has a coherent  definition of what a business model actually is. It's hard to invent a new  business concept if you can't agree on its components...To be an industry  revolutionary, you must develop an instinctive capacity to think about  business models in their entirety.&quot; Then, Hamel describes his business  concept that comprises four major components and several  subcomponents:<br />I- Core Strategy: It is the essence of how the firm  chooses to compete. <br />1. Business Mission: This captures the overall  'objective' of the strategy-what the business model is designed to  accomplish or deliver.<br />2. Product / Market Scope: This captures the  essence of 'where' the firm competes-which customers, which geographies,  and what product segments-and where, by implication, it doesn't  compete.<br />3. Basis for Differentiation: This captures the essence of 'how'  the firm competes and, in particular, how it competes 'differently' than  its competitors.<br />II- Strategic Resources: These are unique firm-specific  resources.<br />1. Core Competencies: This is what the firm 'knows.' (skills  and unique capabilities)<br />2. Strategis Assets: They are what the firm owns  such as brands, patents, infrastructure, proprietary standards, customer  data, and anything else that is both rare and valuable.<br />3. Core  Processes: This is what people in the firm actually 'do.'  (activities)<br />III- Customer Interface<br />1. Fulfillment and Support: This  refers to the way the firm 'goes to market,' how it actually 'reaches'  customers-which channels it uses, what kind of customer support it offers,  and what level of service it provides.<br />2. Information and Insight: This  refers to all the knowledge that is collected from and utilized on behalf  of customers.<br />3. Relationship Dynamics: This refers to the nature of the  'interaction' between the producer and the customer.<br />4. Pricing  Structure: This refers to the price choices depending on the traditions of  your industry.<br />IV- Value Network: It surrounds the firm, and which  complements and amlifies the firm's own resources.<br />1. Suppliers<br />2.  Partners<br />3. Coalitions<br />On the other hand, according to Hamel these four  major components are linked together by three 'bridge' components:<br />1.  Configuration: Intermediating between a company's core strategy and its  strategic resources is first bridge component.<br />2. Customer Benefits:  Intermediating between the core strategy and the customer interface is  second bridge component.<br />3. Company Boundaries: Intermediating between a  company's strategic resources and its value network is third bridge  component.<br />More detailed discussion of these business concepts briefly  mentioned/summarized aboveand the other unique ones, I highly recommend  this invaluable study.	2000-09-05
US	52327458	R20AHTFDI7RJS6	1857882407	903364962	The Next Common Sense: Mastering Corporate Complexity Through Coherence	Books	5	13	13	N	N	&quot;10 Scenic Vistas on the Corporate Landscape&quot;	&quot;The old common sense was about dealing with the discrete elements of a 'complicated' world. The next common sense is about mastering the  'complex' swirl of events and situations around us through coherence. The  old world was a complicated agglomeration of many discrete items. The new  world is a complex one of interdependencies and interrelationships...Our  purpose in writing this book is to help you to be like Alexander the Great.  When confronted with the legendary knot of tangle rope tied by King  Gordius, Alexander knew what to do. Faced with the traditional challenge,  he accepted without hesitation: the complexity of the knot did not phase  him. He drew his sword and cut the Gordian knot with a single, dramatic  stroke, thereby ensuring that he would rule all of Asia. Many before  Alexander had tried and failed, thinking that the knot was complicated and  needed to be untied. Only Alexander saw that a simple action would move  through the complexity to a higher plane. Untying your own Gordian knots  requires nothing more than common sense - the next common sense...In this  book we present 10 scenic vistas on the corporate landscape. All have  elements that derive from complexity science but, more importantly, all  relate to management. From each vista, you the reader are encouraged to  extract simple guiding principles that make sense to you. Creating your own  coherent point of view will be the takeaway from reading this book. We hope  you enjoy the view!&quot; (pp.1-16). <br />In this context, throuhout the book  Michael Lissack and Johan Roos discuss these 10 scenic vistas as follows:  <br />1- Use simple guiding principles. They write, &quot;where the old common  sense was about dealing with local situations and trying to 'sort things  out,' the next common sense is about adopting a global viewpoint, allowing  interactions to happen, which in turn will drive coherent actions&quot;,  and list traditional six bad rules that lead to failure:<br />(1).Treat  business as if it were a war fought on a battlefield.<br />(2). View the  corporation as a machine.<br />(3). Practice management as control.<br />(4).  Treat your employee as children.<br />(5). To motivate, use fear.<br />(6).  Remember, change is nothing but pain.(more detailed discussion see Chapter  2).<br />2- Respect mental models, yours and others'. They write, &quot;the  next common sense is about creating an organizational context for coherent  actions. To create such a context yuo must help the necessary others, i.e.  everyone you interact with, in the process of finding meaning and of  creating a coherent point of view. Another label for this process is making  sense&quot; (more detailed discussion see Chapter 3).<br />3- Use landscape  metaphors to describe both the environment and processes taking place  within it. They write, &quot;landscape images align with today's world -  just look at the ascendancy of the landscape motif in numerous book titles,  articles, conferences, and media events. Landscapes are part of the next  common sense because they provide context we all can relate to. They work  much more easily than jargon, and are better descriptors than the game and  race metaphors of the old common sense&quot; (more detailed discussion see  Chapter 4).<br />4- Combine and recombine and avoid trying to impress yourself  or others with holism. They write, &quot;the beauty of pieces, of building  blocks, is that they can be combined and recombined to create new things,  new ideas, and new ways of relating and interacting. In a world where  wholes are not simply the sum of their parts, it is critical to train  ourselves to think about deconstructing and recombining. The philosophers  may call this postmodernism-we call it the next common sense&quot; (more  detailed discussion see Chapter 5).<br />5- Recognize your multiple roles,  don't hide from them. They write, &quot;we question whether it was ever  common sense to insist that the companyalways comes first, but clearly  that has been a norm in big corporations for years. In the next common  sense it is critical to allow people to be themselves. Only by  acknowledging the many sides of each person can a company hope to obtain  maximum benefits from that person over the long run. Most firms recognize  this for their CEO - it is time they reconized it for the troops in the  trenches&quot; (more detailed discussion see Chapter 6).<br />6- Create  canyons, not canals. They write, &quot;canyons are not about the  command-and-control culture of the old common sense - they are about the  guiding values of the next common sense. Canyons are an analogy for the  guiding viewpoints that managers of interactions need to be effective.  Canals are the comparable analogy for the manager of entities who issued  commands in an effort to manage outcomes&quot; (more detailed discussion  see Chapter 7).<br />7- Tell stories to allow others the benefit of shared  experiences. They write, &quot;stories are about context. The old common  sense may have encouraged the use of bullets as a means of avoiding  context. The next common sense is about telling stories that are open  enough to allow listeners to draw relevant conclusions and authentic enough  to convey their context in metaphors&quot; (more detailed discussion see  Chapter 8).<br />8- Send out scouting parties to probe the environment. They  write, &quot;the old common sense, which may have justified a closed mind,  not-invented-here syndrome, just just does not work in a world of  interactions. The next common sense asks what we can learn from the  environment. Preparation is the key to attaining advantage&quot; (more  detailed discussion see Chapter 9).<br />9- Post and attend to road signs.  They write, &quot;using the next common sense is a matter of recognizing  individual contributions and allowing others to leverage them, while  combating the tendency of individuals to stake out territory and post 'no  trespassing' signs. In a world of interactions, knowledge of opportunities  is key to realizing them, and awareness of fences is an awareness of  opportunities missed&quot; (more detailed discussion see Chapter 10).<br />10-  Fuel coherence with aligned words. They write, &quot;it was never true that  words had only one meaning, but many managers operating from the old common  sense sure acted as if they did - the boss's meaning. Reflection on the  next common sense reveals an essential truth: the words we use can help to  enact the context for our actions. Words that are aligned with values and  purpose can assist intended acts; words that are not aligned can act  instead to obstruct. Word choice matters&quot; (more detailed discussion  see Chapter 11).<br />On the other hand, Chapter 12 is about creating  coherence.As they write, &quot;Chapters 2-11 have given you building blocks  for both making sense of things and developing a coherent point of view.  Now these building blocks need to be used to construct an action plan. This  chapter is about using what you have learned. Five steps are key to  realizing the next common sense in any organization&quot;.And they describe  these steps as follows:<br />(1). Identify yourself and your goals.<br />(2). Use  the right language.<br />(3). Create the right context.<br />(4). Turn people  loose and then get out of the way.<br />(5). Use communication that  works.<br />As argued by them, these five steps are not guarantee of success,  but a tool for attaining the skill of a master.<br />Strongly recommended.	2000-08-31

It is an approach that takes into consideration all  of the factors that affect organizational performance. By examining the  whole organization, and by aligning its systems, structure, and culture to  enable all employees to excell and execute the company's chosen strategy,  corporate leaders can successfully transform their organization...Although  targeted at corporate leaders, this book will benefit anyone interested or  involved in any aspect of organizational change. By understanding the  components of organizational change, frontline employees and middle-level  managers alike can more effectively participate in and guide the change  effort in their part of the organization. A successful organizational  transformation is never the sole accomplishment of a leader and his or her  senior team. Rather, the transformation is achieved through the hard work  and commitment of all types of leaders througout the entire  organization&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context, Christopher W.  Head:<br />* by asking/answering some critical questions such as What is going  wrong? Why are so many change efforts failing? What is an organizational  transformation? defines organizational transformation and indicates key  factors to a successful transformation.<br />* by both asking/answering the  following questions: What characteristics do transformational leaders  possess? What must these leaders do in order to prepare their organizations  for all of the difficult challenges that lie ahead? and comparing  transformational leaders and traditional/transactional leaders, discusses  the leadership factor for a successful corporate transformation.<br />*  explains how leaders can lead effective change by creating an environment  that fosters participation and ownership, and presents a detailed change  management plan (more detailed discussion of this plan see Chapter 3).<br />*  by asking/answering the following questions: How can leaders create a work  environment that fosters high-levels of involvement from all of their  employees? What are the elements that truly empower and involve all  employees? How do organizations benefit from having an empowered workforce  after the transformation process has been completed? discusses the steps  needed to establish a high level of employee involvement within  organization.<br />* by asking/answering the following questions: What is the  best way of getting employees committed to leading the change effort? What  are the transition teams? Why should they be used? Who should be on these  teams and how should team members be selected? What are their core  responsibilities? What kind of assistance do these teams need from top  management and internal or external consultants? How should transition  teams involve customers and suppliers in their work? examines the role of  employees and employee teams (transition teams) during the transformation  process.<br />* by asking/answering the following questions: What is core  process redesign? What steps should organizations follow to redesign and  align their core processes? What are the roles and responsibilities of the  steering committee and transition teams during this stage? What other  groups need to be involved? discusses how transition teams can successfully  redesign and align core processes.<br />* by asking/answering the following  questions: What can organizations do to make sure they create 'good' jobs  for all employees? What elements are needed to make 'natural' work teams  successful? examines the terms 'good' and 'natural' and their importance to  realize drastic performance improvement.<br />* explains the changing role of  middle management and the additional structural changes that an  organization must make to support the newly established work teams.<br />*  argues that &quot;traditional measurement systems, solely focused on  functional outcomes and overall financial performance, fail to provide the  natural work teams with the necessary feedback they need to improve their  performance&quot;, and hence presents an alternative performance  measurement system.<br />* in addition to new performance measurement system,  presents a new performance-based compensation system that rewards and  motivates.<br />* argues that &quot;an organizational transformation is never  truly complete. Rather, it is series of large-scale changes - to the  culture, processes, structure, and so on - over the course of a given time  period, approximately one to three years, followed by continuous learning  and ongoing improvement by all employees. Eventually, despite such  improvement efforts, industry conditions and/or technological developments  will necessitate another transformation in the years ahead&quot;, and  describes how innovative companies are creating continuous improvement by  'learning organizations'.<br />Finally, C. W. Head suggests that  &quot;organizational transformation is not easy. The path to a successful  transformation is often met with many obstacles. You will be confronted  with people who doubt your plans and resist your every move. Do not fight  your resistors. Rather, help educate those who do not yet understand the  value of transforming the workplace, who have yet to tap into the potential  of all employees. Be patient, stay focused, and do not lose hope. Your  perseverance and dedication will pay off as your organization  succeeds&quot;.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-08-23
US	52327458	R33KSF3AUMANGP	0195117646	218690826	Changing the Game: Organizational Transformations of the First, Second, and Third Kinds	Books	5	6	6	N	N	&quot;Business is a game without an end&quot;.	&quot;In its broadest sense, a game involves procedures or strategies for  gaining certain ends. The game of business is to use resources (people,  money, ideas, equipment, and tools) to gain certain ends desired by the  organization. For a corporation, the objectives of the game are to increase  profitability and shareholder value...Whether it is recognized or not, all  organizations operate under a 'game plan'. The 'organizational game plan'  consists of the basic concept of the game being played as well as the  fundamental strategy for playing the game...No matter what game an  organization chooses to play or how it chooses to play it, there are  certain periods in an organization's life when 'the game' (either the game  itself or how it is played) needs to be changed. This occurs when there  have been major changes in the economic environment, or some kind of  revolution in technology or the nature of competition. It can also happen  simply as the result of significant, rapid organizational growth...As used  in this book, the phrase, 'changing the game' has a dual meaning. First, it  refers to changes in the game being played by an organization. This  involves changes in the business an organization is actually in. In  addition, the phrase also refers to changes in the way the game is being  played (i.e., how a firm operates). Both are major aspects of a business  and both can require major transformations, either at different points or  even at the same time. These transformations are the focus of this book and  define what we mean by 'changing the game'...During the past few years,  there has been increasing use of the terms 'transformation' and 'change' in  business literature. Some people unfortunatelly use these terms  synonymously. That is not the way we will use these terms in this  book...Our focus in Changing the Game is on transformation rather than  merely incremental changes&quot; (pp.4-9).<br />In this context, Eric G.  Flamholtz and Yvonne Randle:<br />* describe 'pure' types of transformations,  including what they have termed Transformations of the First, Second, and  Third Kinds:<br />1. Entrepreneurial transformations to professional  management including the special case of family business transformations -  First Kind (more detailed discussion and examples of this kind see Chapter  3).<br />2. Revitalization transformations of established companies - Second  Kind (more detailed discussion and examples of this kind see Chapter  4).<br />3. Business vision transformations - Third Kind (more detailed  discussion and examples of this kind see Chapters 5-6).<br />and note that  actual organizations sometimes engage in compound transformations,  consisting of more than one type of transformation simultaneously.<br />*  present a framework that managers can use to understand and plan what must  be done to build an organization with a high probability of long-term  success, and examine four critical factors that influence the design of a  successful business enterprise:<br />1. The 'business concept' that defines  the business a company is in.<br />2. Six key 'building blocks' of  organizational success.<br />3. The 'size' of the enterprise.<br />4. The  'environment' (markets, competition, and trends) in which the enterprise  will exist.<br />* focus on the strategic transformational planning process in  order to provide a tool for assisting in the process of managing  transformations.<br />* examine how to design an organizational structure that  will support a firm's transformation.<br />* examine the issues involved in  transforming an organization's structure after a strategic transformational  plan has been developed, and show that the choice of the form of  organization to help implement a transformational plan is a strategic issue  in itself.<br />* focus on the behavioral aspects of organizational  transformations, and describe the important role leadership plays in not  only helping to transform the behavior of individuals within an  organization, but in changing the overall game that the organization is  playing.<br />* discuss two additional, powerful tools -performance management  systems and corporate culture management- that can be used to transform the  behavior of all employees within an organization.<br />* present ten key  lessons for Managing Transformations and Changing the Game.<br />Finally, they  argue that &quot;unlike chess and the NCAA basketball tournament, business  is a game without an end. There is no national championship tournament for  business. The game goes on and on. In a sense, a basketball program is like  a business. A given team may win a championship one year, but there is  always the next year and the next and the next, just as in business. As  soon as one profitable year is completed, the next emerges. There is,  however, one constant in the business game year after year: the need to  understand the process of managing organizational transformations.  Accordingly, the final lesson is: adapt and increase the probability of  future success; or remain fixed in the existing paradigm and risk failure.  The game is there for the taking&quot;.<br />I highly recommend.	2000-08-21
US	52327458	R2SS4HNFIPFNPQ	0195123875	893403047	Re-Creating the Corporation: A Design of Organizations for the 21st Century	Books	5	24	25	N	N	&quot;There are no simple solutions to complex problems&quot;.	&quot;This book is a product of applying systems thinking to the  management and organization of enterprises&quot;. Russel L. Ackoff writes,  &quot;therefore, an understanding of the nature of systems and systems  thinking is essential for understanding what this book is about. Although  most people can identify many different systems, few know precisely what a  system is. Without such knowledge, one cannot understand them, and without  such an understanding, one cannot be aware of their implications for their  management and organization and for treatment of the most important  problems that currently face them&quot; (p.5).<br />Thus, he firstly argues  that a system is a whole consisting of two or more parts that satisfies the  following five conditions:<br />(1). The whole has one or more defining  properties or functions.<br />(2). Each part in the set can affect the  behavior or properties of the whole.<br />(3). There is a subset of parts that  is sufficient in one or more environments for carrying out the defining  function of the whole; each of these parts is necessary but insufficient  for carrying out this defining function.<br />(4). The way that each essential  part of a system affects its behavior or properties depends on (the  behavior or properties of) at least one other essential part of the  system.<br />(5). The effect of any subset of essential parts on the system as  a whole depends on the behavior of at least one other such subset.<br />Hence,  Ackoff summarizes his argument that a system is a whole that cannot be  divided into independent parts without loss of its essential properties or  functions, and additionally argues that when the performances of the parts  of a system, considered separately, are improved, the performance of the  whole may not be (and usually is not) improved.<br />Within this general  framework, he:<br />* defines four different types of systems, and shows their  effects on organizations and the way they are managed (more detailed  discussion see Chapter 2):<br />(1). 'Deterministic', systems and models in  which neither the parts nor the whole are purposeful.<br />(2). 'Animated',  systems and models in which the whole is purposeful but the parts are  not.<br />(3). 'Social', systems and models in which both the parts and the  whole are purposeful.<br />(4). 'Ecological', systems and models in which some  parts are purposeful but as a whole have no purposes of their own.<br />* by  considering three primary forms of traditional management and planning  (reactive, inactive, and preactive) and their deficiencies, discusses  systems-oriented/interactive form of management and planning.<br />* discusses  five aspects of interactive planning in separate chapters as follows:<br />-  preparing the state of the organization or a situational analysis (more  detailed discussion see Chapter 4).<br />- determining ideals, objectives, and  goals or ends planning of the organization (more detailed discussion see  Chapter 5).<br />- identifying the gaps between what the organization is and  is now doing and where it wants to be and to be doing (more detailed  discussion see Chapter 6).<br />- considering resources such as money, plant  and equipment (capital goods), people, consumables (materials, supplies,  energy, and services), data, information, knowledge, understanding, and  wisdom, and asking and answering following questions:<br />i. How much will be  required, where, and when?<br />ii. How much will be available at the required  time and place?<br />iii. How should each shortage or excess be treated? (more  detailed discussion see Chapter 7).<br />- implementing and controlling with  learning and adaptation (more detailed discussion see Chapter 8).<br />*  describes and explaines circular type of organization as a democratic  hierarchy.<br />* discusses internal market economies as substitution of the  centrally planned and controlled economies within the organizations.<br />*  discussesthe multidimensional design and organization that eliminates the  need to restructure when internal or external changes require adaptation,  and argues that &quot;the circular organization, the internal market  economy, and multidimensional design can all be combined in one  organization. The power of each is significantly enhanced by its  interactions with the others&quot;.<br />* examines currently popular panaceas  such as downsizing, TQM, continuous improvement, benchmarking, and process  reengineering and the reasons they fail, and argues that &quot;there are no  simple solutions to complex problems. Furthermore, since problems are  interdependent, their solutions should be. Interdependent problems  constitute messes, systems of problems. Therefore, their solutions must  also form a system. A system of solutions is a plan, and plans are  complicated, not simple. It is not possible in a few minutes to find  behavior that will resolve, solve, or dissolve a set of problems that took  years to cultivate&quot;. <br />Strongly recommended.	2000-08-21

It is the age of the smart  worker. The operations that learn the secret of tapping into this knowledge  will always outperform those that do not. Those that master the 'collective  intelligence' of knowledge work teams will be the architects of the  future...As individuals, knowledge workers are smart people. But their  individual effectiveness is amplified when they are also part of a smart  organization. As an effective knowledge team, they can often create a sort  of synergy where the outcome of the whole is greater than the sum of its  individual parts. These smart teams appear as though all team members are  of a common mind that shares information and ideas seamlessly across the  membership-a distributed mind...This book is about knowledge work teams.  Knowledge work requires a special set of skills related to an area of  expertise, such as those of an engineer, a salesperson, a consultant, a  manager, or a health-care professional. But it requires much more than  technical competence to be successful as a knowledge worker&quot; (from the  Introduction).<br />In this context, Kimball Fisher and Mareen Duncan  Fisher:<br />* define knowledge work by comparing five characteristics that  differ for physical and knowledge work as follows:<br />- Job Characteristics:  (1). Core task, (2). Critical skills, (3). Work process, (4). Work outcome,  (5). Knowledge used.<br />- Job Characteristics of Physical Work: (1). Doing,  (2). Physical, (3). Usually linear, (4). Product, (5). Applied.<br />- Job  Characteristics of Knowledge Work: (1). Thinking, (2). Mental, (3). Usually  nonlinear, (4). Information, (5). Created.<br />* argue that &quot;the nature  of work is changing from mostly linear to mostly nonlinear and from  requiring mainly physical skills to requiring mainly mental acuity. Jobs  now usually produce more information than product and require more  improvisation than rote, automatic application of process. While thistrend  is dramatic in a few cases, for most of us the change has been a slow,  steady evolution of our jobs&quot;, and illustrate this trend.<br />* show how  teams and team-based operations differ from groups and non-team-based  operations, and illustrate how these teams differ from the traditional  organizations by comparing hierarchical organizations with team-based  organizations as follows:<br />- Hierarchical Organization: hierarchical  order, local optimum, maximum specification, functional defect control,  specialized skill, vertical information flow, work ethic value, and  conservative improvement.<br />- Team-Based Organization: information order,  global optimum, minimum critical specification, source defect control,  multiskilled, source information flow, work life value, and continuous  improvement.<br />* illustrate the differences between physical and knowledge  work teams by comparing typical physical work teams with knowledge work  teams.<br />- Typical Physical Work Teams: physical labor, multiple  generalists, inside single organization, fairly stable membership, and  repetitive responsibilities.<br />- Typical Knowledge Work Teams: mental  labor, multiple specialists, across multiple organizations, shifting  membership, and single-purpose responsibilities.<br />* explore the process of  knowledge work design, and illustrate the characteristics of evolving  organizational form-learning lattice organization. <br />* discuss the  metaphors and practices needed to create successful knowledge teams.<br />*  argue that &quot;environmental shifts and changes in organizational  capabilities have created opportunities and need for virtual knowledge  teams in contemporary organizations. To effectively create, utilize, and  support VKT's, we must focus more attention on the VKT challenges&quot;,  and then discuss the challenges of making VKTs effective.<br />* discuss  fostering innovation and creativity as a critical challenge for knowledge  work. <br />*discuss what is becoming a critical attribute of effective  knowledge work teams: the ability to transfer knowledge effectively without  causing information overload.<br />* discuss the role of leaders in knowledge  teams, and argue that &quot;in knowledge work teams, team leadership is  critical. Although this formal leadership is often shared or rotated, we  believe it must be done properly for the team to be effective&quot;.<br />*  discuss a number of practical tips to prevent illness in teams, including  providing team training, integrating new team members, setting goals and  measuring results, understanding group decision-making processes, managing  team conflict, building team communication skills, giving and receiving  feedback, defining team members' roles and responsibilities, developing  operating guidelines, and creating a team charter.<br />* explore how  technology aids knowledge work, and argue that &quot;technologies must be  appropriately integrated into the organization if they are to benefit  knowledge teams. Three particular problems to avoid are technology misuse,  expecting more from technology than it can reasonably deliver, and serving  technology instead of having technology serve the team&quot;.<br />* discuss  future trends in knowledge work by illustrating six key work trends for the  new millennium: (1). automation of physical work, (2). elimination of  traditional jobs and work structures, (3). empowered knowledge workers,  (4). knowledge work teams predominant, (5). workplace flexibility, (6).  more virtual knowledge teams. <br />Strongly recommended.	2000-08-10

Built on a traditional model,  these training groups have done more to hinder progress in creating  knowledge-enabled organizations than they have helped. A new model is  needed, not just for the training group but for the company as a whole.  Becoming a knowledge-enabled organization involves not just the training  group but everyone from the CEO down; it requires basic changes in how the  company is organized and run. The good news is that you can get there from  here. This is your guidebook for making the journey&quot; (from the  Introduction p.3).<br />In this context, Daniel R. Tobin:<br />* argues that  &quot;training programs in most companies today rob the company in two  ways. First, because formal training programs developed and delivered by  traditional training groups are ineffective in helping the company and its  employees succeed in meeting their goals, they waste large amounts of money  and time. Second, by creating the illusion that formal training programs  can meet the company's learning needs and those of its employees, by  separating employees' learning needs and learning activities from their  actual work, companies miss opportunities to improve individual and company  performance, meet or exceed stated goals, and create real competitive  advantage&quot;.<br />* presents the four stages of his learning model as an  alternative to the traditional model, and examines some common barriers  (unavailability of data, inability to find relevant, purposeful data,  failure to recognize and share tacit knowledge), and other inhibitors  (misdirected measurement and reward strategies, rigid organizational  structures, and policies and procedures that force people to work in the  same old ways even while the leaders are pointing to new directions) to  knowledge development.<br />* examines what it means to be a knowledge-enabled  organization.<br />* argues that &quot;one key to creating a knowledge-enabled  organization is the practice of developing individual employee learning  contracts for every employee in the company. The learning contract  specifies the knowledge and skills that the employee must acquire over the  next year to meet individual goals. These goals are tied directly to  functional, departmental, and business unit goals and must have a direct  relation to the company's overall business goals&quot;.<br />* examines a wide  range of learning options and how they can fulfill employees' learning  contracts.<br />* as a guide for starting to build a company's knowledge  network, presents some excellent practices that companies have undertaken  to build their own knowledge networks, and argues that &quot;without a  positive learning environment, no organization can become  knowledge-enabled, regardless of how much it spends on tools and  technologies&quot;.<br />* discusses how today's successful companies create a  positive learning environment, and argues that &quot;to succeed in becoming  a knowledge-enabled organization, a company must change how the leaders  lead; how it structures communications, up, down, and throughout the  company; how it measures and rewards employees; and how it structures work  and job design&quot;.<br />* advises that companies 'throw out the training  catalog, not the training group' (because training catalogs reflect the  past and limit the potential for real learning), and presents a new model  for a group that it be named employee and organizational learning.<br />*  examines the learning organization, a term popularized by Peter Senge, and  the corporate university and relates them to the model of the  knowledge-enabled organization, and argues that &quot;Senge's five  disciplines can be valuable tools, but are not sufficient,in and of  themselves, to create a knowledge-enabled organization, and establishing a  corporate university does not guarantee that there will be any change in  the way the corporation's employees are trained&quot;.<br />* in addition to  developing knowledge and skills within the company, examines the other two  knowledge-acquisition strategies: buying knowledge and skills, and renting  knowledge and skills, and says that &quot;the knowledge-enabled  organization also learns from customers, suppliers, and even  competitors-from any and every relevant source within or without the  company&quot;.<br />Finally, Daniel R. Tobin writes, &quot;creating a  knowledge-enabled organization is a prerequisite for any company's future  success. There is no function, no job within any company today, regardless  of industry or location, that is not knowledge-based. At the same time, the  amount of knowledge that employees at all levels need to do their jobs is  expanding exponentially; in the future no employee will be able to master  all of the knowledge needed to do a job. The best that we can do for our  employees is to build a positive learning environment where they are  engaged in continuous learning and can use knowledge networks to gather and  share the knowledge they need to succeed individually and  collectively&quot;.<br />Strongly recommended.	2000-08-08

The book is based on two premises. The first is that the  nature and intensity of competition have changed, and so organizations are  now required to be simultaneously more effective and more flexible in their  ability to reconfigure themselves, carry out their dynamic strategies, and  make sure they are delivering value to their customers faster and better  than their competitors. The second is that strategy and organization are  not enough: organizations must also create new approaches to the human  issues that accompany change&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this context,  editors divide this invaluable study into four parts:<br />Part I- Designing  Competitive Organizations. In this part (Chapters 1-4):<br />* E. E. Lawler  III, D. Finegold, and J. A. Conger focus on the development of a framework  for understanding the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of  corporate boards, and specific principles and practices that can contribute  to board effectiveness.<br />* J. R. Galbraith describes customer-product  structures, and focuses on three questions concerning this kind of  structures: (1). What are hybrid structures? What do they like? (2). Why  are companies choosing to organize in this way? (3). How do we make hybrid  structures work effectively?<br />* J. R. Galbraith argues that &quot;the new  information technology facilitates the networked organization by allowing  independent firms to join together in networks&quot;. And then he describes  the various design issues that have to be addressed in networked  organizations.<br />* J. R. Galbraith examines the factors on which companies  organize their global operations, and considers the major approaches to  organizing, as well as where those approaches fit.<br />Part II- Enabling  Competitive Performance. In this part (Chapters 5-7):<br />* D. Finegold, E.  E. Lawler III, and G. E. Ledford Jr. ask that 'Is attention to competencies  another management fad, or is it a more fundamental and lasting change in  the theory and practice of managing organizations and individuals? Then,  answering this question, they examine three distinct competency approaches  as well as tensions among them. <br />* S. G. Cohen and D. Mankin argue that  &quot;New information technologies, combined with the global competitive  pressures, have fundamentally changed the nature of work&quot;. Then they  examine this impact of information technology on the nature of work.<br />* E.  E. Lawler III and S. A. Mohrman review employee involvement, total quality  management, and reengineering approaches with an eye to assessing both how  they unfolded and their long-term implications for the field of  management.<br />Part III- Managing People in the Competitive Organizations.  In this part (Chapters 8-11):<br />* S. A. Mohrman and E. E. Lawler III  outline the specifications of new human resources management, and argue  that &quot;the human resources function not only must become a true  business partner but also must be a microcosm of the organizations in which  it is embedded&quot;.<br />* D. Finegold, after describing the main elements  of new learning paradigm for building competencies, reviews the steps that  firms can take to identify a clear set of priorities for development and to  evaluate the make-or-buy decisions regarding training.<br />* J. A. Conger and  K. R. Xin describe changes in the nature of executive education, changes  that include an increased focus on developing executives for the new  competitive environment and the new, more lateral organizational forms.<br />*  E. E. Lawler III focuses on how pay systems can be designed to support  particular strategies, and argues that &quot;the challenge for  organizations is to integrate their pay systemswith business strategy and  with overall organizational design. This challenge must be met if  organizations are to compete effectively in rapidly changing global  markets&quot;.<br />Part IV- Transforming the Organization. In this part  (Chapters 12-14):<br />* D. Mankin, S. G. Cohen, and T. K. Bikson provide  frameworks for creating high-performing organizations through the design  and implementation of new information technologies and the team-based  organizations that employ them , and describe the change processes needed  to create the new organization.<br />* R. V. Tenkasi, S. A. Mohrman, and A. M.  Mohrman Jr. study organizations as they have gone through a fundamental  transformation in their organizational model and the factors that  contribute to accelerated learning during transitions, and then describe  the dynamics that characterize organizational learning as organizations  change their underlying architectures.<br />* A. M. Mohrman Jr. and S. A.  Mohrman argue that &quot;performance management is central to managing the  business, defining the individual's relationship with the organization, and  providing a mechanism for feedback and control&quot;. Thus, they describe  some of their research and experience to show how and why this happens.<br />I  highly recommend this study to all executives.	2000-07-31

Hesselbein, M. Goldsmith, and I. Somerville, &quot;Leading Beyond the Walls focuses on the first requirement of leadership in the twenty-first century.  In the chapters, leaders at all levels will find inspiration and practical  advice on building effective organizations that focus on their strengths  and employ the resources of individuals, organizations, and communities  beyond their walls. This book explores what is needed to transcend the  personal walls that inhibit effectiveness and the organizational, social,  and political boundaries that inhibit reaching out. It will help all  leaders to achieve personal excellence and high performance and to lead  beyond the old boundaries to forge partnerships that are essential in the  increasingly challenging period ahead. Leading ourselves and our  organizations beyond the walls is the first requirement for success in the  years to come. It's a call for engagement; one each of us must answer&quot;  (from the Preface).<br />In this context, for instance:<br />* Jim Collins  displays four important points to executives in order to be effective in  the next century (pp.19-28):<br />- First, executives must define the inside  and the outside of the organization by reference to core values and  purpose, not by traditional boundaries.<br />- Second, executives must build  mechanisms of connection and commitment rooted in freedom of choice, rather  than relying on systems of coercion and control.<br />- Third, executives must  accept the fact that the exercise of true leadership is inversely  proportional to the exercise of power.<br />- Fourth, executives must embrace  the reality that traditional walls are dissolving and that this trend will  accelerate. <br />* C. K. Prahalad argues that &quot;In the new millennium,  managers are likely to live and work in a new competitive environment  characterized by the coexistence of intense global competition and  increased global opportunities&quot;. Hence, he outlines some of the  personal traits of leaders in the new millennium (pp.29-36).<br />* Charles  Roussel explains how some leading companies are expanding and deepening  governance to cope with the demands of the networked global enterprise by  comparing new and old governance (pp.57-69)<br />* Stephen R. Covey identifies  principles you need to be an effective leader beyond the walls  (pp.149-158).<br />* Marshall Goldsmith and Cathy Walt, in addition to  communicating vision, demonstrating integrity, focusing on results, and  ensuring customer satisfaction, describe emerging competencies for  tomorrow's global leaders such as thinking globally, appreciating cultural  diversity, demonstrating technological savvy, building partnership, and  sharing leadership (pp.159-166).<br />* Rita Harmon and Mel Toomey define five  specific characteristics, or abilities, needed by leaders beyond the  walls:<br />- the ability to design powerful relationships.<br />- the ability to  create systemic change.<br />- the ability to distinguish and work with  preservative, creative, and development systems.<br />- the ability to develop  comfort with risk while building trust.<br />- the ability to value diversity  as the source of contribution.<br />Finally, Peter F. Drucker writes,  &quot;There is need for acceptance of leaders in every single institution  and in every single sector that they, as leaders, have two  responsibilities. They are responsible and accountable for the performance  of their institutions, and that requires them and their institutions to be  concentrated, focused, limited. They are responsible also, however, for the  community as a whole...Yes, each institution is authonomous and has to do  its own work the way each instrument in an orchestra plays only its own  part. But there is also the 'score', the community. And only if each  individual instrument contributes to the score is there music. Otherwise  there is only noise. And this book is about the score&quot;  (p.17).<br />Strongly recommended.	2000-07-28
US	52327458	R2UMN0O2XQFV3X	0787948098	598648573	Rewarding Teams : Lessons From the Trenches	Books	5	10	12	N	N	An invaluable guide for team-based reward and recognition.	&quot;Certainly there are good books for compensation professionals on the technical aspects of designing incentive plans for teams, and handbooks that offer creative laundry lists of recognition ideas of individual  contributors. But there are few sources for people on the firing line  looking for practical advice coupled with real-life examples of how to  design reward and recognition systems for teams, not individuals. This book  provides practical advice and detailed examples of effective organizational  unit (group) incentives, project team incentives, and recognition plans. It  is for managers in organizations that have made a commitment to a  collaborative culture and who want to create effective reward systems for  teams...At the heart of this book are case studies of reward plans in  companies large and small, in many industries, and of many  cultures...Whenever organizations try to make teamwork the norm, many  supporters become frustrated because the usual reward-and-recognition  programs don't support it. In this book, the fictional BIZCOM Corporation  and its managers show how frustration about teams can turn into success.  BIZCOM's trials and tribulations are based on the authors' years of  experience working with organizations&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this  context, Glenn Parker, Jerry McAdams, and David Zielinski:<br />* describe  BIZCOM, a fictitious company that wants to use a team approach to adress a  critical business problem, and discuss team and organizational development  issues such as vision, sponsorship, membership, stakeholders, launches,  training, coaching, management style, and organizational support.<br />*  discuss reward and recognition systems, communications and performance  feedback, and training and development tools for creating a team-based  organization.<br />* introduce an organizing model for rewards, and discuss  organizational culture. At this point, they argue that &quot;One general  description of the whole organization's culture is possible, although  organizations are made up of a number of suborganizational units, each with  a slightly different culture. Accounting has a different culture than  marketing. Manufacturing has a different culture than customer service.  Hopefully, they are aligned with the overreaching organizational culture,  with the differences simply reflecting the nature of the work they  do&quot;. And they also argue that &quot;One of the keys to success in  improving organizational performance is to ensure that reward plans  reinforce the desired culture, or at least attempt to reduce the gap  between the existing and desired culture&quot;.<br />* define six types of  reward plans: (1) individual base compensation and benefits, (2) individual  capability (competency), (3) individual incentives, (4) recognition, (5)  project team incentives, (6) organizational unit incentives. (But  throughout the book they mainly focus on the last three plans - more  detailed examination of these plans in several companies and review of  their experiences see Chapters 3-5).<br />* summarize how you can best utilize  project, recognition, and group incentive plans to improve teamwork and  organizational performance as lessons from the trenches (more detailed  discussion of these trenches see Chapter 6):<br />(1). Customize the  plan.<br />(2). Align plans with business objectives.<br />(3). Send the right  message.<br />- create many winners, few losers<br />- involve employees in the  selection process<br />- trust the folks<br />(4). Use noncash as well as cash  awards.<br />- noncash awards are not limited to recognition plans<br />- give a  few big awards and lots of small ones<br />- pay the taxes on noncash  awards<br />(5). Communicate, communicate, communicate.<br />- never assume  people understand<br />- tell people how they are doing - all the time<br />-  reinforce the messages<br />- role modeling works<br />(6). Create a smorgasbord  of plans.<br />(7).Budget for recognition activities.<br />(8). Keep  administration in mind.<br />(9). Payoffs are in the eye of the  beholder.<br />(10). How plans are introduced and operated is  paramount.<br />Finally, they argue that &quot;There are no silver bullets.  There is a good will, faith in the value of employee contributions, good  business judgement, and willingness to act on a strategy of teamwork  reinforced by rewards and recognition plans. We've learned how to manage  financial, fiscal, and customer capital. Leveraging human capital is the  challenge for the next century. Reward and recognition plans designed to  encourage teams and teamwork is one way to meet that challenge&quot;.<br />I  highly recommend this invaluable study to all executives and HR  professionals.	2000-07-24

They have the deep insight and long foresight necessary to perceive the consequences their actions will have...This book tells twelve different stories that could not  have happened without the DreamMakers involved. These DreamMakers come from  all sectors of society all over the world -corporations, local and national  goverments, nonprofit organizations, and voluntary community groups. They  also come from different economic and social backgrounds. They come from  different national, cultural, ethnic, and racial backgrounds.What they  share, however, is far more powerful and important than how they  differ...This is a book about hope, intended for anyone who is seeking to  create a better future. It is especially for those who choose to accept  leadership roles, who sense on an intuitive level that we are living in an  unprecedented time in which to make a difference, and who are looking for  inspiration, insights, and ideas to reshape our institutions, communities,  and lives. The people I call DreamMakers are not those we read about in the  headlines every day. They are not necessarily, nor would they identify  themselves as, heroines, heroes, or geniuses. They have, however,  discovered and tapped in to the extraordinary nature and power we all have  within us. It is my hope that, from hearing these personal stories, others  may discover that ability as well&quot; (from the Preface).<br />In this  context, Michele Hunt firstly tells the theories underlying this book, and  formulates: <br />1. 'The Power of Shared Vision' by defining vision as our  deepest expression of what we want to create. And she argues that &quot; I  believe vision fuels our passion and lifts us above our fear. It is our  North Star for exploring and charting our future&quot;.    <br />2. 'Shared  Values of DreamMakers' by asking some questions as follows:<br />* How they  see the world, how they treat people, how they take in information, how  they make decisions, how they build teams, how they use creativity, how  they act, how they respond to 'failure', how they learn and grow, and how  they are anchored (more detailed discussion and answers of these questions  see Chapter 1).     <br />In the following Chapters, she tells the stories of  different individuals/DreamMakers. And she summarizes these stories, as  'lessons we learned', end of the each chapter. These lessons learned from  all stories told in the book can be summarized as follows:<br />* DreamMakers  express vision and values.<br />* DreamMakers engage others in their  vision.<br />* DreamMakers work with others to build a shared vision. <br />*  DreamMakers understand that we are all connected and interdependent.<br />*  DreamMakers support diversity and honor the integrity and contributions of  all people.<br />* DreamMakers question and challenge the status quo.<br />*  DreamMakers value and nurture interpersonal relationships.<br />* DreamMakers  tap in to the extraordinary potential in all of us.<br />* DreamMakers find  unprecedented opportunities for transformation and renewal in the current  climate of rapid change.<br />* DreamMakers collaboratively transform and  renew themselves and others.<br />* DreamMakers make their dreams a  reality.<br />* DreamMakers are both passionate and compassionate.<br />*  DreamMakers focus on education and continual learning.<br />* DreamMakers  trust feelings, emotions, and intuition.<br />* DreamMakers learn from their  mistakes.<br />* DreamMakers foster creativity and hope.<br />* DreamMakers  follow a moral compass.<br />* DreamMakers believe in a higher power and  purpose.<br />* DreamMakers demonstrate responsibility toward a large  community.<br />* DreamMakers are committed to making the world a better  place.<br />As written by Max De Pree, &quot;Stories about people tell us both  who we are and who we might become. Stories map the paths toward potential  and unity. The stories in DreamMakers are honest, real stories. Not  everythig works. Not everything is easy. Ann Denison writes, 'We had to  call the police, and they arrested him'. Leadership and service are  demanding&quot;.  <br />I highly recommend.	2000-07-21

As we move into the new  millennium and find ourselves in a knowledge economy, it is undeniable that  people are the profit lever. All assets of an organization, other than  people, are inert. They are passive resources that require human  application to generate value. The key to sustaining a profitable company  or a healty economy is the productivity of the workforce, our human  capital...Drucker claims that the greatest challenge for organizations  today and for the next decade at least is to respond to the shift from an  industrial to a knowledge economy...This shift toward knowledge as the  differentiator affects all aspects of organizational management, including  operating efficiency, marketing, organizational structure, and human  capital investment...Since employee costs today can exceed 40 percent of  corporate expense, measuring of the ROI in human capital is essential.  Management needs a system of metrics that describe and predict the cost and  productivity curves of its workforce&quot; (pp.1-3). <br />Within this general  framework, Jac Fitz-Enz argues that without measurement we cannot:<br />*  communicate specific performance expectations.<br />* know what is going on  inside the organization.<br />* identify performance gaps that should be  analyzed and eliminated.<br />* provide feedback comparing performance to a  standard or a benchmark.<br />* recognize performance that should be  rewarded.<br />* support decisions regarding resource allocation, projections,  and schedules.<br />In short, he argues that &quot;if we don't know how to  measure our primary value-producing assets, we can't manage it&quot;.<br />On  the other hand, in Chapter 1, he displays many of the management panaceas  that have hit the market in the past fifty years as follows:<br />** 2000?    ?   ?   ?   ?<br />-Intellectual Capital-Learning  Organization<br />-Rightsizing-Balanced Scorecard-EVA<br />** 1990  -TQM-Reenginering-7 Habits-Delayering<br />-Downsizing-Customer  Service-Benchmarking<br />-Kaizen-Empowerment-Continuous Improvement<br />** 1980  -Corporate Culture-Change Management-MBWA <br />-Intrapreneuring-Relationship  Marketing-Excellence<br />** 1970 -Quality Circles-Diversification-One Minute  Managing<br />- Work Simplification-Needs Hieracchy-Statistical Process  Control<br />- Organizational Renewal-Value Chain-Portfolio Management<br />**  1960 -Managerial Grid-Matrix-Hygienes and Motivators-Theory Z<br />-Theory  X&amp;Y-Plan-Organize-Direct-Control-Human Relations<br />** 1950 -Management  by Objectives-Management Science-Decision Tree<br />I highly recommend this  'must' reading study to all executives and HR practitioners.	2000-07-21

Posner  introduce &quot;The Janusian Leader&quot; - the leader with the capacity to  look forward and back, to preside over endings and beginnings, sunsets and  daybreaks. They also present seven key lessons that stand the test of time  and are worthy of being carried with us from one millennium to another (see  pp.17-32).<br />* S. Ghoshal, C.A. Bartlett and P. Moran suggest: &quot;When  the solution to a recurring problem is always 'Try harder', there is  usually something wrong with the terms, not the execution. So it is time  for both managers and management academics to throw out the old paradigm  and to start experimenting with new, more fertile possibilities&quot; (see  pp.121-140).<br />* C.K. Prahalad argues: &quot;In the new millennium, the  methods and skills needed to manage large and small organizations will be  different from those needed to be succesful during the past three decades.  Newer concepts and tools will emerge&quot;. He then discusses the emerging  nature of managerial work and suggests that this transformation of  managerial work will demand basic organizational innovations (see  pp.141-150).<br />* P.M. Senge and K.H. Kaufer write: &quot;Faced with  profoundly new business realities-unprecedented demands from global  competition, new technologies, emerging markets, possible mergers and  alliances, and growing environmental pressures-many companies are falling  back on old leadership habits...Rather than making executives less  important, we argue that understanding leadership communities brings the  unique roles of executive leaders into much clearer relief, as it does the  roles for other types of leaders-all of whom will ultimately depend upon  one another in creating successful 21st century enterprises&quot; (see  pp.186-204).<br />* D. Ulrich suggests: &quot;Since the future is  unpredictable but coming anyway, we need to prepare as best we can by  projecting about context, organization and people&quot;. He then gives his  observations about the contextual factors impacting on organizations, how  organizations will operate, and how individuals must prepare themselves  today to respond tomorrow (see pp.235-249).<br />* R. Moss Kanter argues:  &quot;Brainpower is to the global information economy as oil was to the  industrial economy...Business leaders increasingly understand that one of  their new roles in the 21st century is to contribute to creating such  environments in the communities in which their companies operate.  World-class leaders will be cosmopolitans who avoid insularity, enjoy the  challenge of confronting new and different ideas, encourage  cross-fertilization and learning across boundaries, and support their  people in developing and using their brainpower in pursuit of  innovation&quot; (see pp.250-261).<br />I highly recommend.	2000-07-18

The luncheon drew 17 CEOs  representing both manufacturing and service industry companies. All were  intrigued by the potential hidden value that the intellectual capital  perspective suggests lies untapped within their businesses, but none knew  what kinds of value they could obtain from their company's intangible  assets or how they might go about it. They just knew that there was hidden  value in their companies and that it was somehow wrapped up in the  thoughts, skills, innovations, and abilities of their employees. They  wanted to learn more about this value: how to harness it, direct it, and  extract value from it. This book is written for those CEOs and for anyone  else who wants to know how to extract the hidden value that resides within  the firm's intellectual capital. As of this writing dozens of firms  actively engage in extracting value from their IC. The people directing the  activities for these firms have formed a community  (called the ICM  Gathering) to share their ideas and success stories. With the expectation  of a very few proprietary bits of information that could be useful to  competitors, these firms are willing to share their knowledge, and this  book draws heavily on their experiences. The purpose of this book is to  help businesses profit from one of their most important assets, their  intellectual capital&quot; (from the Introduction pp.3-4).<br />In this  context, Patrick H. Sullivan divides his book into three major parts as  follows:<br />I. The Relationship Between Intellectual Capital and Corporate  Value (Chapters 1-4). In this part, he basically: <br />* defines and  discusses intellectual capital and its importance, and outlines some of the  basic concepts underlying corporate value.<br />* describes a  three-dimensional IC framework that reveals the ICaspect of the firm, and  outlines the four key elements of the IC framework.<br />* discusses the kinds  of value that intellectual capital provides to the firm, including direct  and indirect, offensive and defensive, and internal and external value.<br />*  discusses the ways managers may determine which activities are required to  produce the firm's anticipated IC value.<br />II. Valuing Knowledge Companies  (Chapters 5-7). In this part, he basically:<br />* discusses the concepts that  underlie determining the amount of value that intellectual capital has for  an organization.<br />* discusses the quantitative value of knowledge  companies in two different kinds of situations: the value as a going  concern (the stock market value), and the value in a merger or acquisition  scenario.<br />* discusses the following questions: When determining how much  to pay for a knowledge company being acquired, how does the potential  purchaser make the calculation? Is the frame of reference an accounting or  financial one? Or is it an intellectual capital one?<br />III. Managing  Intellectual Capital (Chapters 8-12). In this part, he basically:<br />*  describes the key elements involved in extracting value from intellectual  property, including key decisions and decision-making processes, including  who is involved, what information is needed by the decision-makers, what  work processes are necessary to provide this information, what databases  are needed to store the information, and how each decision will be  implemented.<br />* discusses the similarities and the differences between  intellectual property and intellectual asset and the implications this has  for the intellectual capital management process.<br />* describes the  relationship between knowledge, knowledge types, and intellectual capital,  and introduces the relationship between knowledge and profits, the concept  of value creation and value extraction.<br />* discusses management of the  firm's core human capital and how they may be best employed.<br />* identifies  the steps required of companies that want to implement and intellectual  capital management capability.<br />In addition to these three parts, to  reinforce the reader's knowledge, he discusses basic intelectual capital  management (ICM) concepts and definitions, and provides a brief overview of  the evolution of ICM as a working discipline in the appendix.<br />I highly  recommend this invaluable study to all executives and HR practitioners.	2000-07-17

Kenneth W. Thomas writes, &quot;The first is to give you a solid conceptual framework for understanding intrinsic motivation and why  it is vital to the new work. The problem is that most of us have already  learned to think about motivation in rational-economic ways, so that kind  of thinking seems solid to us, and other ways of thinking often seem  'soft'. I have tried to give intrinsic motivation that same kind of  solidity by laying a firm conceptual foundation in Parts I and II of this  book. Part I establishes the need for new models. It discusses the  revolution in work, why extrinsic rewards are no longer enough, and the  limitations of rational-economic thinking...Then Part II examines the  essence of the new work in more detail, emphasizing how purpose has been  reintroduced into that work. It discusses how workers are now being asked  to self-manage in pursuit of purposes, and then lays out the key steps  involved in self-management. Part III, the heart of the book, discusses the  four intrinsic rewards that come from -and energize- those self-management  steps: a sense of meaningfulness, choice, competence, and progress&quot;  (from the Preface).<br />In this context, in Part III, he provides a  diagnostic framework for intrinsic motivation. As the first step of this  framework, in Chapter 6, he introduces (1) a complete map of the intrinsic  rewards needed to reinforce self-management, and (2) a set of building  blocks that are needed to produce each intrinsic reward. Hence, as the  second step, in Chapters 7-10, he discusses each intrinsic reward in more  detailed, along with actions to provide the building blocks. <br />(1). The  Four Intrinsic Rewards<br />i. A sense of 'Meaningfulness' is the opportunity  you feel to pursue a worthy task purpose (more detailed discussion see  Chapter 7).<br />ii. A sense of 'Choice' is the opportunity you feel to select  task activities that make sense to you and to perform them in ways that  seem appropriate (more detailed discussion see Chapter 8).<br />iii. A sence  of 'Competence' is the accomplishment you feel in skillfully performing  task activities you have choosen (more detailed discussion see Chapter  9).<br />iv. A sense of 'Progress' is the accomplishment you feel in achieving  the task purpose (more detailed discussion see Chapter 10).<br />(2). Building  Blocks for the Intrinsic Rewards<br />i. Meaningfulness: a non-cynical  climate, clearly identified passions, an exciting vision, relevant task  purposes, and whole tasks (more detailed discussion see Chapter 7).<br />ii.  Choice: delegated authority, trust in workers, security (no punishment for  honest mistakes), a clear purpose, and information (more detailed  discussion see Chapter 8).<br />iii. Competence: knowledge, positive feedback,  skill recognition, challenge, and high, non-comparative standards (more  detailed discussion see Chapter 9).<br />iv. Progress: a collaborative  climate, milestones, celebrations, access to customers, and measurement of  improvement (more detailed discussion see Chapter 10).<br />Finally, he argues  that &quot;To understand intrinsic motivation, it's important to see the  limitations of the rational-economic model that dominated motivational  thinking in the compliance era. At its heart, intrinsic motivation is not  about rational calculation-it is about passion and the positive feelings  that people get from their work. These feelings reinforce or energize  workers' self-management efforts and also provide the fulfillment that is  needed to keep today's workers on the job. Building intrinsic motivation,  then, is about finding ways to enable and amplify those feelings&quot;  (p.107).<br />Strongly recommended.	2000-07-07
US	52327458	RMMUZWRON4C1F	0273650157	162310382	Living Strategy: Putting People at the Heart of Corporate Purpose	Books	5	19	24	N	N	&quot;People are at the centre of business success&quot;	&quot;My purpose...is simple: to share with you the experiences of three companies (HP, Glaxo Wellcome, and Motorola) and to review the wider body of research which together have convinced me of the prime role of people in  organizational success. But that only raises the 'so what' question...so  what if people are at the centre of organizational success? I believe that  putting people at the heart of organizational success has implications on  'how we think' about organizations and 'what we do' within them. The first  part of this book addresses the question of how we think about  organizations if we put people at the heart of corporate purpose. For me it  raises three basic tenets of being human: we operate in time, we search for  meaning, and we have a soul. With this comes a set of nine organizational  and managerial capabilities that support these tenets. The second part of  the book addresses the question of what we can do to create living  strategies that place people at the centre. Over the years I have refined a  six-step process that puts people at the heart of corporate success. This,  together with the workbook that follows, provides a frame for you to move  from this as rhetoric to action-based reality&quot; (pp.3-4).<br />In this  context, Lynda Gratton firsty introduces  the three tenets and the nine  capabilities of new agenda as follows:<br />I. First tenet: we operate in  time<br />* Past beliefs, hopes and commitments influence our current  behavior: the 'memory of the past'.<br />* Current behavior is influenced by  beliefs about what will happen in the future: the 'memory of the  future'.<br />* Skills and knowledge take many years to develop.<br />* Human  development progresses through a shared sequence.<br />* Attitudes and values  are resistant to rapid change.<br />Capabilities:<br />1. Build visionary  capabilities.<br />2. Develop scanning capabilities.<br />3. Create strategic  capabilities.<br />II. Second tenet: we search for meaning<br />* We strive to  interpret the clues and events around us, we actively engage with the world  to seek a sense of meaning, to understand who we are and what we can  contribute.<br />* Symbols, which may be events or artefacts are important in  creating a sense of meaning.<br />* Over time groups of people create  collective viewpoints, a sense of shared meaning.<br />Capabilities:<br />4.  Develop diagnostic capabilities.<br />5. Create systemic capabilities.<br />6.  Build adaptive capabilities.<br />III. Third tenet: we have a soul<br />* Each of  us has a deep sense of personal identity of what we are, and of what we  believe in.<br />* We can trust and feel inspired by our work-and when we do  we are more creative.<br />* We can dream about possibilities and events.<br />*  We can choose to give or withold our knowledge-depending on how we  feel.<br />Capabilities:<br />7. Develop emotional capabilities.<br />8. Create  trust-building capabilities.<br />9. Capability to build the psychological  contract.<br />According to Lynda Gratton, to understand 'how' of putting  people at the centre of corporate strategy, firstly we must understand  'why' this is crucial. Therefore, at the first stage she  explores these  tenets and capabilites as briefly mentioned above (more detailed discussion  see Part II pp.25-94). At the next stage,to create a living strategy she  developes a six-step process (build a guiding coalition, imagine the  future, understand current capability and identify the gap, map the system,  model the dynamics, and bridge into action) which goes from building  commitment to moving into action (more detailed discussion see Part III  pp.97-210). Finally, she presents a workbook to provide an opportunity to  consider the philosophy and practice of a living strategy (see Part IV  pp.213-229).<br />Highy recommended.	2000-07-06
US	52327458	R2THHX1USYQUJ9	0787946990	951134207	The Corporate Culture Survival Guide	Books	5	53	53	N	N	&quot;Learning about culture requires effort&quot;	&quot;I am writing again, to supplement my longer books of 1985 and 1992 (Organizational Culture and Leadership, first and second editions respectively), and to be more pointed in my argument. There is now abundant  evidence that corporate culture makes a difference to corporate  performance; we know that leaders increasingly need concepts and tools for  working with culture in varied and subtle ways. If you want to take a  serious rather than superficial look at culture in organizations, struggle  through this book with me-and let the complexity inform you rather than  turn you off...In each chapter, I provide the logic of the argument, but I  also give you case material and practical suggestions for what you can do  to test the ideas for yourself. I hope the chapter titles are  self-explanatory; you should feel free to jump around to follow your own  questions. I find that learning to see the world through culturally more  sophisticated lenses is fun. You see more, and you understand more. I hope  that you too discover that it is fun to have cultural insight&quot; (from  the Preface).<br />In this context, Edgar Schein argues that &quot;The bigger  danger in trying to understand culture is to oversimplfy it in our  minds&quot;. Therefore, according to Schein, instead of say that culture is  'the way we do things around here', 'the rites and rituals of our compay',  'the company climate', 'the reward system', 'our basic values', and so on,  a better way to think about culture is to realize that it exists at several  'levels'. Thus, he firstly categorizes   culture into three levels (more  detailed discussion see Chapter Two): <br />1. 'Artifacts': These are visible  organizational structures and processes (hard to decipher).<br />2. 'Espoused  Values': These are strategies, goals, and philosophies of an  organization(espoused justifications).<br />3. 'Shared Tacit Assumptions':  These are unconscious, taken-for-granted beliefs, perceptions, thoughts,  and feelings(ultimate source of values and action).<br />Hence, after  reviewing popular views on culture, he abstractly defines culture as the  sum total of all the shared, taken-for-granted assumptions that a group has  learned throughout its history. And to give a more realistic view of what  culture covers, he outlines the areas in which cultural assumptions make a  difference as below (more detailed discussion see Chapter Three). At this  point, he argues that &quot;cultural assumptions involve not only the  internal workings of the organization but, more important, how the  organization views itself in relation to its various environments&quot;.   In other words, culture is deep, extensive, and complex. It covers all  aspects of reality and human functioning. <br />1. External Survival  Issues<br />* Mission, strategy, goals<br />* Means: structure, systems,  processes<br />* Measurement: error-detection and correction systems<br />2.  Internal Integration Issues<br />* Common language and concepts<br />* Group  boundaries and identity <br />* The nature of authority and relationships   <br />* Allocation of rewards and status <br />3. Deeper Underlying  Assumptions<br />* Human relationship to nature<br />* The nature of reality and  truth<br />* The nature of human nature<br />* The nature of human  relationships<br />* The nature of time and space<br />Within this general  principles, he examines all aspects of culture throughout the book, and  finally he argues that &quot;Learning about culture is requires effort. You  have to enlarge your perception. You have to examine your own thought  process. You have to accept that there are other ways to think and do  things&quot;.<br />Strongly recommended.	2000-06-29
US	52327458	R1JMVBEOAS07IV	0070251614	666651426	The Talent Solution: Aligning Strategy and People to Achieve Extraordinary Results	Books	5	15	15	N	N	&quot;Improving Business Results with People&quot;	&quot;This book is about why it's essential to connect strategy and people to manage talent, and more importantly, how to do it. It rests on three key concepts: alignment, engagement, and measurement. Alignment means pointing  people in the right direction. Engagement means fostering commitment to  your basic purpose and direction. Measurement means providing connected and  balanced ways for your company and employees to keep score about how you  are doing. When you do all three things, you will be managing your talent  and company to achieve extraordinary results&quot; (from the Introduction  p.9).<br />In this context, Edward L. Gubman introduces 'Improving Business  Results with People (IBR) Model' used by Hewitt consultants as an alignment  model. He argues that &quot;The IBR model is designed to ensure you line up  all the critical elements in talent management. If you pay attention to  these pieces and execute them right, you will create alignment that enables  you to achieve extraordinary business results&quot; (p.32). Thus, he  elaborates this model in more detailed throughout the book. <br />The stages  of the IBR model can be outlined as follows:<br />1. 'Business Results and  Strategies' describe the outcomes you are trying to achieve as a company  and the strategies you are using to get there. Thus, he defines strong  business results as:<br />* great value for customers,<br />* rewarding work  situations for employees-including psychological, social, and financial  rewards,<br />* high returns for shareholders. (more detailed discussion see  Chapter 2).<br />2. 'Business Capabilities' refer to your distinctive  abilities as an organization to use money, technology, information, people,  and other resources to create a competitive advantage. He argues that  &quot;Your goal in developing these capabilities is to build unique  abilities that competitors have difficulty copying so you have the  advantage&quot; (p.46).(more detailed discussion see Chapter 3).<br />3.  'People Requirements' are the things you demand from people to exercise  your capabilities-what you need from them to be successful. He describes  these requirements as the Three Cs: culture, competencies, and contract,  and  argues that &quot;These three are interrelated so it's hard to  separate them completely&quot; (p.57).(more detailed discussion see Chapter  4).<br />4. 'Employee Priorities' are the 'bottom-up' of the equation. In this  stage, he focuses on the changing nature of the employement relationship as  a context for engaging employees, what engagement is and how you can  increase it, and the psychology of engagement and change.(more detailed  discussion see Chapters 9 to 11).<br />5. 'Workforce Strategies' are the  distinctive plans you have for acquiring, developing, deploying, and  retaining your people for competitive advantage. He argues that &quot;Smart  companies build plans for their workforce just like they build plans for  the other parts of their business&quot; (p.75). Hence, he describes  elements of a workforce strategy: (a).people requirement-the cultural  values, competencies, and contract, (b).employees' needs, fears, and goals,  (c).the resulting employement relationship, (d).organization design, and  (e).priorities for change.(more deatailed discussion see Chapter 5).<br />6.  'Management Practices' describe the ways you enact your workforce  strategies. In this stage, he examines (1) three major criteria for  excellent management practices-alignment, integration, and execution, and  (2) five management practices-staffing, organizing, learning, performing,  and rewarding.(more detailed discussion see Chapters 6 to 7).<br />7.  'Business Interactions' is where all business results occur. He argues that  &quot;All business results come from interactions-leaders with employees,  employees with employees, and employees with customers. These interactions  are changing, and some are becoming much more electronic. Sometimes the'employee' now is an ATM machine, a voice-mail box, home page, or voice  response circuit&quot; (p.143). Hence, in this stage, he examines these  interaction processes.(more detailed discussion see Chapter 8).<br />8.  'Balanced Measurements' are both the business and individual measurements  that gauge how well you and your employees are doing. He argues that  &quot;Measurement is the last of the three processes you need to connect  talent to strategy to deliver outstanding results&quot; (p.225).(more  detailed discussion see Chapters 12 to 14).<br />Finally, as conclusion, he  rightly argues that &quot;The growing effects of the information economy,  globalization, and changing demographics are coinciding to create a new era  in business-the era of talent. Your ability to attract, manage, and retain  talent will determine whether you succeed. This wasn't always true in the  past. Before, you could succeed if you controlled enough physical  resources. Today, talent is the fundamental resource in business&quot;  (p.292).<br />Highly recommended.	2000-06-24
US	52327458	R39TLEH8HDCOVE	1890009318	146981561	Leadership from the Inside Out	Books	5	56	57	N	N	It is about both leadership and personal development.	&quot;While reading this book you may think, 'Is this book about leadership, or is it about personal development?' It's about both&quot;. Kevin Cashman writes, &quot;As much as we try to separate the leader from  the person, the two are totally inseparable. Unfortunately, many people  tend to split off the 'act of leadership' from the person. We tend to view  leadership as an external event. We see it only as something people do. The  view of this book is different. Leadership is not simply something we do.  It comes from somewhere inside us. Leadership is a process, an intimate  expression of who we are. It is our being in action. Our being, our  personhood, says as much about us a leader as the act of leading itself.  Paul Walsh, Chairman and CEO of Pillsbury, recently told me, 'The missing  link in leadership development is growing the person to grow the leader'.  As we grow, so shall we lead...As we learn to master our growth as a  person, we will be on the path to mastery of Leadership from the Inside  Out&quot; (pp.18-19). <br />Within this framework, Kevin Cashman identifies  seven pathways to mastery of Leadership from the Inside Out. He says that  &quot;These pathways to mastery are not stages of development arranged in a  sequential or hierarchical order. Rather, they are an ongoing, interrelated  growth process in which the pathways constantly are illuminating one  another&quot; (pp.28-29). <br />1. Personal Mastery / Leading Through  Authentic Self-Expession: It is the onging commitment to unfolding and  authenticaly expressing who we are.<br />Principles: Take total  responsibility, practice personal mastery with others, bring beliefs to  conscious awareness, develop awareness of character and persona, listen to  feedback, consider finding a coaching process, and be flexible.<br />2.  Purpose Mastery / Leading by Expressing Our Gifts to Create Value: It is  the ongoing discovery of how we express our gifts to add life-enriching  value to the world.<br />Principles: Focus on how to make a difference, get in  touch with your values, act &quot;on-purpose&quot;, be purposeful in all  domains, encourage others to find purpose, seek the goal, learn from  &quot;failure&quot;, and be flexible.<br />3. Change Mastery / Leading in the  Flow: It involves embracing the purposeful learning contained in the  unending, creative flow of life.<br />Principles: Be open to learning,  practice present-moment awareness, integrate immediate focus and broad  awareness, trust yourself, develop resiliency through mental-emotional  stretching, practice the change mastery shifts, and take the leap.<br />4.  Interpersonal Mastery / Leading Through Synergy: It is the dynamic blending  of personal power with synergy power to create value and  contribution.<br />Principles: Build relationship bridges, balance personal  power with synergy power and contribution power, build awareness of  intention-perception gap, personal mastery and interpersonal mastery are  intimately connected, become aware of your structure of interpretation, and  practice the five touchstones (know yourself, listen, express, appreciate,  serve) to authentic leadership.<br />5. Being Mastery / Leading Through Being:  It is connecting with the silence and peace of the innermost depth of one's  character to support more dynamism, effectiveness, and  contribution.<br />Principles: Take your own journey into being, resolve life  challenges by going to a deeper level, consider learning to mediate, and  integrate more reflection into your life.<br />6. Balance Mastery / Leading by  Centering Our Life: It is the dynamic centering of our life to build  resilience and to enhance effectiveness and fulfillment.<br />Principles:  Choose wisely, be on-purpose, rest and reflect more, exercise for  enjoyment, simplify your life, and loosen up.<br />7. Action Mastery / Leading  as a Whole Person: It is the ongoing commitment to creating value through  enhanced authenticity and self-expression.<br />Principles: Seek the most  essential first, approach growth and development as an integrated, lifelong  process, take total responsibility, value consistency over intensity, set  aside worry, doubts, and negativity, don't just walk the talk, become the  talk, and build awareness through inside out journaling.<br />Finally, Kevin  Cashman argues that &quot;Certainly the principal purpose of Leadership  from the Inside Out is to give people tools for personal growth and  transformation leading to leadership growth and transformation. But its  true potential contribution is more than that. Its purpose is more than  just helping a bunch of seperate individuals to grow...Growth is fulfilling  as it touches and enriches the lives of others&quot; (p.203).<br />I highly  recommend.	2000-06-22
US	52327458	RAOIMKD6QULBY	0787909475	716975545	Champions of Change: How CEOs and Their Companies are Mastering the Skills of Radical Change (The Jossey-Bass Business and Management Series)	Books	5	14	14	N	N	&quot;Five Stages of Discontinuous Change&quot;	&quot;Your first visit to a new company can be awfully confusing. From the outside you see the front of the headquarters building and the visitor's entrance-but not much more. Inside you see a maze of offices and work  areas-but at first glance they don't seem to be arranged in any particular  pattern. You see people rushing busily to and fro, but you have no idea  what they're doing or what, if anything, they're actually accomplishing. If  you're to have any chance of quickly making sense of what's going on-of how  the company is organized and how it really operates-you need a mental  template, a systemic way to observe and understand the organization. For  executives and managers intent on leading change, that kind of template, or  model, is essential. Without it you haven't a clue where to  start...Throughout this book I'm going to be talking about organizational  change in terms of a model my colleagues and I have developed and refined  over the past two decades&quot; (p.21).<br />In this context, David A. Nadler  divides his book roughly into three sections. In the first section, he (1)  overviews the forces that make change at once so inevitable and so  difficult in modern organizations, (2) describes the pivotal role of top  leadership, (3) describes the four basic types of organizational change,  with a special emphasis on the most difficult of all-the Overhaul, or  radical discontinuous change, (4) explores the inevitable resistance to  change, and (5) offers some specific techniques for overcoming those  barriers. In the second section, he (1) deals with the substantive tools  and techniques that are required as the organization passes through the  five stages of the change cycle, (2) describes in turn the issues that  confront leaders as they go about changing each component of the  organization. In the third section, he deals with the unique role of top  managers in leading change.<br />In Chapter 4, he introduces five stages of  discontinuous change:<br/>1. Recognizing the change imperative: The easy  description of this stage is simply that it answers the question, What's  going wrong here? (for detailed discussion see Chapter 6)<br />2. Developing a  shared direction: Providing clear direction for change and building  coalition that will provide the support essential to the success of any  radical change effort. (for detailed discussion see Chapter 7)<br />3.  Implementing change: The core of the change process. (for detailed  discussion see Chapters 8 to 11)<br />4. Consolidating change: Making change  an integral part of the way the organization operates. (for detailed  discussion see Chapter 12)<br />5. Sustaining change: The challenge of  maintaining momentum, avoiding complacence, and searching for signs of the  next wave of change. (for detailed discussion see Chapter 12)<br />On the  other hand, in Chapter 5, he lists and discusses twelve action steps for  overcoming resistance to change as follows:<br />1. Build the support of key  power groups.<br />2. Use leader behavior to generate support.<br />3. Use  symbols and language deliberately.<br />4. Define points of stability.<br />5.  Create dissatisfaction with the current state.<br />6. Build participation in  planning and implementing change.<br />7. Reward behavior in support of  change.<br />8. Provide people time and opportunity to disengage from the  old.<br />9. Develop and communicate a clear image of the future state.<br />10.  Use multiple leverage points.<br />11. Develop transition management  structures.<br />12. Collect and analyze feedback.<br />He argues that &quot;the  twelve action steps are not a recipe for transition management. They're a  template to be overlaid on each organization and adjusted to its unique set  of circumstances&quot; (p.108).<br />Highly recommended.	2000-06-19

Jack J. Phillips writes, &quot;Some HR executives recognized the change and  stepped up to the challenge. A panel of top-level HR executives recently  assembled by Personnel Journal agreed that HR is moving away from the  transactional, paper-pushing, hiring/firing support function it has been  and is becoming a bottom-line business decision maker...Peter Drucker  predicted these changes in The Wall Street Journal over ten years ago when  he asserted that the personnel department, in addition to changing its name  to human resources, must behave quite differently and follow the line mode  of behavior rather than the staff mode&quot;(pp.1-5).And hence, he rightly  argues that &quot;from recent articles, reports, books, and interviews on  the subject, seven trends can be identified that have a significant impact  on an organization's bottom-line results and the HR function's role in the  process. These trends include the increased importance of the HR function,  increased accountability, organizational change and quality programs,  improvement in productivity, adoption of HR strategies, growing use of HR's  information systems, and reliance on partnership relationships.  Collectively these trends enhance or complement the efforts of the HR  department to monitor and improve its contribution to organizational  performance&quot; (pp.5-6).<br />Within this context, he divides his book into  four parts as follows:<br />Part I- presents a general framework for  evaluating the HR function (Chapters 1-2)<br />Part II- presents the issues  involved in developing a results-based approach to HR (Chapters 3-4)<br />Part  III- focuses on specific ways to measure the contribution of HR (Chapters  5-9)<br />Part IV- explores data analysis and presentation results.<br />One of  the core concepts of the book, in Chapter 1, he focuses on paradigm shiftsfrom traditional HR approach to a more results-based approach demanded in  today's environment, and summarizes these paradigm shifts necessary for a  results-based approach as follows:<br />Traditional Approach:<br />(1) New  programs initiated by request or suggestion of any significant manager or  group. <br />(2) A maltitude of programs in all areas. <br />(3) Existing  programs are rarely, if ever, eliminated or changed. <br />(4) Count  activities, hours of involvement, number of employees involved, etc. <br />(5)  Limited management involvement in the HR process. <br />(6) HR viewed as cost  center. <br />(7) HR staff unfamiliar with operations issues. <br />(8) HR staff  lack knowledge of finance and business concepts.<br />Results-Based  Approach:<br />(1) New programs initiated only after a legitimate need is  established. <br />(2) Fewer programs with greater opportunity to make an  impact. <br />(3) Existing programs are regularly reviewed and eliminated when  necessary. <br />(4) Measure the impact of programs on the organization.  <br />(5) Extensive involvement and collaboration with management. <br />(6) HR  is viewed as an investment in employees. <br />(7) HR staff very knowledgeable  about operations issues. <br />(8) HR staff versed in basic finance and  business concepts.<br />I highly recommend this invaluable study to all HR  executives.	2000-06-16

Jon R. Katzenbach writes, &quot;It describes how each path concentrates management attention on  worker fulfillment to harness the emotions of many people in sustaining a  higher-performing workforce. This is a different challenge than simply  motivating people to meet demanding financial performance objectives. The  latter is what most companies do, and it implies setting unambiguous goals,  establishing clear measures, and holding people individually accountable  for results (consequence management). Logical, rational motivation is  certainly a good thing, but it is no match for engaged, emotional  commitment...Energizing people for performance elevates the game  significantly, to the point that many employees go well beyond leaders'  expectations, individual accountabilities, financial resuts, and short-term  market objectives. This book describes how to unleash the full individual  and collectve potential of people to achieve and sustain higher levels of  performance than the workers themselves thought possible, than management  or customers expected, and than competitors can realistically achieve.  Unleashing the full potential of people is undeniably a tall order; few  institutions have managed to do it consistently. This book explores the  approaches of those who apparently have gone far beyond any conventional  notions of managing solely to meet ambitious financial objectives. It looks  at how such institutions tap into worker fulfillment to develop the extra  quotient of emotional commitment that deeply energizes many people to  perform well beyond conventional norms&quot;.<br />In this context, Jon R.  Katzenbach introduces five paths (balanced paths) that explain all the  higher-performing workforce situations. As argued by Katzenbach, &quot;each  path constitutes a clearly different approach for energizing a workforce  for higher performance. Certainly, there are overlaps and similarities  among the paths, but the primary focus and value proposition of each is  quite distinct&quot;. Hence, throughout this invaluable study, he explores  these five paths as the overarching concept or framework for this book. And  he defines (1) top management philosophy, and (2) characteristics of the  five balanced paths as follows:<br />I- Mission, Values, and Pride:<br />(1).  Employees will feel truly proud of what this enterprise stands for, what  their specific work group can accomplish, and what they can contribute,  both collectively and individually; their pride will be continually  reinforced with external and internal recognition.<br />(2). a. Noble  purpose<br />b. Rich history<br />c. Strong values<br />d. Group cohesion<br />II-  Process and Metrics:<br />(1). Employees who consistently meet and exceed  their metrics and adhere to the critical process requirements will be  recognized and respected by their peers and conspicuously recognized and  rewarded by management.<br />(2). a. Clear measures and standards<br />b. Focused  processes<br />c. Performance transparency<br />d. Collaborative and collective  effort<br />III- Entrepreneurial Spirit:<br />(1). Employees will be rewarded  directly in proportion to what they create and the personal risk they  incur; those rewards have virtually unlimited upside financial and  ownership potential.<br />(2). a. High earning opportunity<br />b. Strong  ownership interests<br />c. Personel risk<br />IV- Individual Achievement:<br />(1).  Employees will be recognized and rewarded directly in proportion to their  personal accomplishments. They will be paid and advanced based on those  contributions, and they will work alongside talented individuals in the  field.<br />(2). a. Lots of opportunity<br />b. Individuals given freedom to  act<br />c. Focus on individual performance<br />d. Performance-based  advancement<br />e. Healty competitiveness<br />V- Recognition and  Celebration:<br />(1). Employees will be recognized, rewarded, and celebrated  in dozens of ways-by supervisors and colleagues as well as top  management-for their collective and individual contributions. As a result,  they will work in an environment alive with enthusiasm, excitement, and fun  and wherein formal compensation is of secondary importance.<br />(2). a.  Widespread recognition/reward<br />b. Lots of specific events<br />c. Visible  high energy<br />d. Social interaction and fun<br />Strongly recommended.	2000-06-12

Douglas K. Smith writes, &quot;It has been more than 30 years since Peter  Drucker wrote about the importance of managing for results. His work led to  the widespread practice of management by objective. But an awful lot has  happened in the past 30 years. The world of business and organizations has  changed dramatically, turning many of Drucker's specifics (though not his  wisdom) upside down. In the aftermath of total quality, customer service,  time-based competition, strategic alliances, globalization, reengineering,  core competencies, continuous improvement, innovation, teams, horizontal  organization, benchmarking, best place to work, information technology,  diversity, environmentalism, deregulation and reregulation, eCommerce, and  privatization, those of us left standing in today's organizations are  unsure about what performance goals and outcomes make the most difference  and why. We know that setting performance goals is key to managing  ourselves and others, but we no longer know how&quot;.<br />Douglas K. Smith  organizes his book in four parts. In the first part (Chapters 1-4), he  provides the background, concepts, tools, techniques, and frameworks you  need to set specific outcome-based goals that matter to successfully  navigate today's most pressing performance challenges. In the second part  (Chapters 5-7), he focuses on helping you align and coordinate goals  throughout your organization. In the third part (Chapters 8-10), he  describes the management disciplines you need to achieve your goals and how  to make choices among them. In the fourth part (Chapter 11), he concludes  the book with a step-by-step design for building an outcomes management  system in your organization.<br />In this context, in Chapter 10, he reviews  the management disciplines you must understand in order to succeed in the  face of change, and introduces the critical distinction between  decision-diven change and behavior-driven change, and describes how to  manage each successfully. Hence, he argues that most change efforts fall  far short of their potential. Usually that's because leaders fail to  address the deep behavioral changes they are seeking. And thus, he lists  the following ten management principles as the heart of any successful  change effort: <br />1. Keep performance results the primary objective of  behavior and skill change.<br />2. Continually increase the number of  individuals taking responsibility for their own change.<br />3. Make sure that  each person always knows why his or her performance and change matters to  the purpose and results of the whole organization.<br />4. Put people in a  position to learn by doing and provide them with the information and  support they need just in time to perform.<br />5. Embrace improvisation as  the best path to both performance and change.<br />6. Use team performance to  drive change whenever demanded.<br />7. Concentrate organizational designs on  the work that people do, not on the decision-making authority they  have.<br />8. Create and focus energy and meaningful language because these  are the scarcest resources during periods of change.<br />9. Stimulate and  sustain behavior-driven change by harmonizing initiatives throughout the  organization.<br />10. Practice leadership based on the courage to live the  change you wish to bring about. <br />Finally, he argues that if you expect  others to change their behavior, you have to change yours. It's as simple  and as hard as that. <br />I strongly recommend.	2000-06-05

Vicere and Robert M. Fulmer write,  &quot;There is a little interest in the old mainstay term 'management  development'. Managers today are often viewed as bureaucrats whose major  function is to create complexity and preserve the status quo. 'Executive  education' is a more desirable term, but in today's flatter, more networked  organizations, there is a less demand for 'executives', often viewed as  aloof and removed from the realities of the competitive marketplace. And  the word 'education' connotes the esoteric contemplation of academic  issues, a process at odds with today's fast-paced business environment.  There does seem to be great interest in the term 'leadership development',  which characterizes processes for identifying and developing exceptional  people capable of moving an organization into the twenty-first century.  Although developing tomorrow's leaders is a critical concern for most  organizations, equally important is the need to create new structures and  processes that will enable the organization to effectively compete in a  rapidly changing, global economy. Rather than viewing these two concerns as  separate challenges, benchmark organizations from around the world have  begun to combine them in an expanded developmental focus which we call  'strategic leadership development'.This focus blends traditional executive  education activities with management, leadership, and organizational  development techniques to create hands-on, real-time learning laboratories  within organizations, which facilitate concontinuous learning, continuous  knowledge creation, and organizational competitiveness. This book focuses  on the challenge of strategic leadership development-what it is, how it  arose and is evolving, and how it is being addressed today&quot; (from the  Preface).<br/>In this context, Albert A. Vicere and Robert M. Fulmer :<br />*  discuss several critical ideas that are fundamental to their thinking,  including the nature of strategic leadership and the concept of a learning  organization.<br />* describe the traditional paradigm for leadership  development, and discuss today's challenges to this traditional way of  thinking, and hence describe how organizations are refocusing their  leadership development efforts to better develop their pool of strategic  leadership talent.<br />* discuss how strategically focused leadership  development processes can help build sustainable organizational  competitiveness.<br />* discuss the nature of new paradigm for effective  organizations, how it operates, and how it relates to the evolving  approaches to leadership development.<br />* present a systems model for  strategic leadership development to illustrate the major forces shaping the  behaviors and outcomes within the field.<br />* discuss the nature of various  techniques and methodologies for leadership development and present a  framework for selecting among them.<br />* compare internal and external  strategic leadership development programs, and through case study analyses  of university-based general management and company-specific programs define  the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.<br />* present the processes  for selecting and managing providers of strategic leadership  development.<br />* discuss assessment and evaluation techniques.<br />* present  six leading-edge examples of new paradigm approaches to leadership  development.<br />* present the seven core elements of strategic leadership  development process/'seven Pc' to illustrate the evolution of the field  from the past, through today's transition state, to the future.<br />I highly  recommend this invaluable study to all executives and HR practitioners.	2000-06-05

Leaders have decided it is time to open opportunities to  deeper participation and involvement by all so that real innovation is  possible. But how can this be done? It is increasingly obvious that it is  essential to get top performance from people in all areas of circle. A new  workplace scenario reflecting a new mind-set- a community of connected  people who care more deeply about their organization- is needed&quot;  (pp.1-2).<br />Hence, she defines new workplace as 'the new workplace  community'. &quot;Community means connections among groups over time. The  term evokes images of belonging and pride, a symbolic home. Transferring  those images to a 'workplace community'- a workplace that is moral and  respectful, and that treats employees as 'responsible agents' of the  organization- is highly desirable.&quot; According to Jane Galloway Seiling  the New Workplace Community: (a). is inclusive, integrative, and flexible,  (b). sets goals that attract the input of organizational members, (c).  encourages collaborative partnerships, (d). communicates effectively, (e).  instills pride in organizational memberships, (f). is steadfast in  difficult situations, (g). understands that the phrase 'we are the  organization' is significant to the success of the workplace  community.<br />In this context, throughout this invaluable book, she  discusses the seven principles of membership to the workplace community as  follows:<br />1. Contribution: All organizational participants are 'members.'  All members, wherever they are in the organizational circle, contribute to  the well-being of their co-members and the workplace community. (For  detailed discussion see Chapter Two)<br />2. Motivation: Members (1) are  competent to perform, (2) are challenged to perform, (3) are personally and  collectively empowered to take action, and (4) feel they and their work are  significant to the overall achievement of the organization. (For detailed  discussion see Chapter Three)<br />3. Decisioning: Decisions are made in the  organization through consideration of the three bottom lines: human,  social, and financial. The identification of potential long-term outcomes  for the organization, as well as for the internal and external customers  and the community, are central to the decisioning process. (For detailed  discussion see Chapter Four)<br />4. Relationship: For all members, the  'relational approach' is basic in working with others. It is the  responsibility of every member to establish connecting relationships that  work and that add energy to the individual, the group, and the  organization. (For detailed discussion see Chapter Five)<br />5. Leadership:  Chosen, assigned leader-members still lead. Leadership happens at all  levels, and every member has the potential to be a catalyst for achievement  and an agent for change. (For detailed discussion see Chapter Six)<br />6.  Accountability: Members are willingly and individually responsible and  accounable for working toward organizational goals. (For detailed  discussion see Chapter Seven)<br />7. Advocacy: Members willingness to promote  co-members and the workplace community positively influences the  performance of individuals, groups, and the organization. (For detailed  discussion see Chapter Eight)<br />She argues that the principles of  membership when accepted as the way to work throughout the organization,  encourage members to share a common purpose, vision, and goals; stimulate  interactive energy; and create the possibility that members can and will  accept the urgency of performance as a personal responsibility.<br />I higly  recommend.	2000-05-29

The worth of a company was determined in large measure by the sum  of its tangible resources.&quot; Gregory G. Dess and Joseph C. Picken  write, &quot;In recent years, however, companies like Microsoft,  PeopleSoft, America Online, and Amazon.com have turned this model inside  out. These companies, dealing in software and services and built on a  foundation of intellectual capital with little or no tangible investment,  have created extraordinary value for their investors, far in excess of the  worth of their physical and financial assets. Traditional industries based  on tangible assets, such as oil, autos, steel, and financial services, have  lagged far behind, reinforcing the argument that value is determined not by  the sum of an organization's resources but by how efficiently those  resources are used and redeployed into new opportunities over time...(Thus,  today) management faces two key challenges. The first is to address the  quality and capabilities of the human capital resource itself: to recruit,  develop, and retain the best talent available. The second is to design and  configure the organization's structural capital-   the key processes and  structures that link its human, knowledge and information, and tangible  resources to each other and to its core value-creating processes- so as to  maximize the potential and performance of the entire entity. Our focus  throughout this book is on how leading companies are meeting these  challenges in a changing competitive environment&quot; (from the  Preface).<br />In this context, in Chapter One, they firstly define two key  management challenges:<br />I. Structural Capital: They argue that the  principal role of structural capital is to link the resources of the  organization together into processes that create value for customers and  sustainable competitiveadvantage for the firm. And hence, they identify  key components of structural capital as follows:<br />1. Core Value-Creating  Activities<br />* Core business processes<br />* External relationship with  customers, suppliers, and alliance partners<br />* Reputation, brand loyalty,  image, and legitimacy<br />2. Organizational Structure, Systems, Processes,  and Culture<br />* Organizational and reporting structures<br />* Operating  systems, processes, procedures, and task designs<br />* Information and  communications infrastructures<br />* Resource acquisition, development, and  allocation systems<br />* Decision processes and information flows<br />*  Incentives, controls, and performance measurement systems<br />* Mechanisms to  promote sharing, collaboration, and organizational learning<br />*  Organizational culture, values, and leadership<br />II. Human Capital: They  argue that our definition of human capital focused primarily on  capabilities, knowledge, skills, and experience, all of them embodied in  and inseparable from the individual. And hence, they identify eight key  categories, or elements, of human capital as follows:<br />1. Motor skills:  The ability to grasp, place, move, and manipulate objects in coordinated  movements<br />2. Information-gathering (perceptual) skills: Sensory,  perceptual, and interpretative capabilities<br />3. Information-processing  (cognitive) skills: The ability to reason, analyze, and make decisions<br />4.  Communication skills: The ability to listen, communicate, and share  information and ideas<br />5. Experience: Know-how from having done the task  before<br />6. Knowledge: Knowledge of self, the job, the organization, and  the environment<br />7. Social skills: The ability to interface, coordinate,  and collaborate productively with others<br />8. Values, beliefs, and  attitudes: Personal values that shape perceptions, performance, and  attitudes<br />I highly recommend to executives and HR practitioners.	2000-05-29

Friedman, J. Hatch, and D. M. Walker write, &quot;but few companies know their value-or how to enhance it. In the view  of too many corporate chiefs, HR managers are mere functionaries  implementing programs that are no more than extra costs to be cut in times  of trouble...Everyone in progressive organizations recognizes that the HR  function must become more closely linked to strategy. As the HR function  evolves from administrative to strategic, the question can be asked (and  objectively answered), what are we doing to enhance the value of human  capital in our organization? Although the effectiveness of the HR  department is a part of this answer, it is only one part. Arthur Andersen  has developed an approach that can help companies measure the value of all  policies affecting human capital, and align these policies more closely to  corporate goals. This method, which we can call 'Human Capital Appraisal',  shows how companies can measure and increase the returns on their  investments in people (p.39).&quot;<br />In this context, they describe a  series of necessary five stages in the management of human capital covering  the five major human capital areas as (a). recruitment, retention, and  retirement, (b). rewards and performance management, (c).career  development, succession planning, and training, (d). organizational  structure, and (e). human capital enablers, as follows:<br />1. Stage One -  Clarification: In this stage, companies identify and confirm their overall  business direction or strategy in the broadest sense of the terms.(for a  detailed discussion of this stage see Chapter 4)<br />2. Stage Two -  Assessment: In this stage, companies calculate the cost of investment in  human capital, and the value employees place on this investment.(for a  detailed discussion of this stage see Chapter 5)<br />3. Stage Three - Design:  In this stage, companies begin to create programs that can yield better  returns on human capital. (for a detailed discussion of this stage see  Chapter 6)<br />4. Stage Four - Implementation: In this stage, companies put  these proposed changes into practice. (for a detailed discussion of this  stage see Chapter 7)<br />5. Stage Five - Monitoring: In this stage, companies  check this new system. (for a detailed discussio of this stage see Chpter  8) <br />As conclusion, they argue that 'Human Capital Appraisal' is a  holistic approach based on the two equally important dimensions of stages  and areas-time and space. It is in the squaring of these elements that the  real substance of human capital development can emerge. By following a  sequence for enhancing human capital, and by ensuring coverage of all areas  within each part of the sequence, companies can improve their returns on  investment in this area-by far the most critical for companies today  (p.45).<br />Strongly recommended for executives and HR professionals.	2000-05-25

As stated by series editor Sheldon Zedek,&quot;the general purpose of this volume is to provide a discussion of the relationship between the changing nature of work and the understanding, measurement, and influence of human  performance. More specifically, the volume addresses how seven key changes  in the nature of work-changes in technology, job design, type of workforce,  training methodology, external control, leadership, and work  structure-affect how job performance is viewed and measured. Three HR  domains are emphasized: staffing, motivation, and training and  development...The goal of the volume is not only to present greater  understanding of the changing nature of performance but also to offer  concrete ways in which to deal with the change.&quot;<br />In this context, in  Chapter Seven - 'Leadership and the Nature of Performance', Robert G. Lord  and Wendy Gradwohl Smith argue that the relation between leadership and  performance is likely to increase while at the same time exercising  effective leadership may become more difficult because of: (1). increased  diversity in experience and technical training will reduce the degree to  which organizational members share common performance standards, (2).  greater ethnic, racial, and gender diversiy will increase the potential  tensions among team members due to less homogeneous values and  beliefs.Thus, they argue that this increased diversity creates greater need  for leaders to define performance and manage group conflict effectively,  and hence they construct a leadership model. On the other side, they  summarize some of the important trends noted by other authors of this book  that will affect the relationship of leadership to performance as  follows:<br />I. In the Past:<br />1. Work organization: (a). Map job onto  employee, (b). Relative ease in identifying KSAOs.<br />2. Design of jobs:  (a). Stable jobs, (b). Common elements of jobs shared among a number of  people.<br />3. Technology: (a). Relativeease in identifying individual and  technological contributions to performance, (b). Little performance  monitoring using technology.<br />4. Control of performance: Internal sources  used for performance standards.<br />5. Meaning of performance: Performance  defined by past behavior.<br />6. Leadership and supervision: Traditional  leadership and supervision.<br />7. Part-time and temporary workers: Minimal  concern for commitment to organization, learning, and development due to  the stability and structure of jobs.<br />II. Current Trend:<br />1. Work  organization: (a). Map job onto team, (b). More or different KSAOs and  greater difficulty identifying KSAOs.<br />2. Design of jobs: (a). Less stable  jobs, (b). Common elements of jobs shared among fewer people.<br />3.  Technology: (a). Confounding individual and technological contributions to  performance, (b). Greater performance monitoring using technology.<br />4.  Control of performance: External sources used for performance  standards.<br />5. Meaning of performance: (a). Performance defined by future  behavior, continuous learning, (b). Different cultural views of good  performance.<br />6. Leadership and supervision: Leadership that emphasizes  skill development, teams, and identities.<br />7. Part-time and temporary  workers: Greater concern for commitment to organization, learning, and  development due to the instability and team-based nature of jobs.<br />I higly  recommend this book as a whole for HR professionals.	2000-05-24

The incisive thinkers and remarkable  leaders who have contributed to the journal and to this book open doors,  spark ideas, raise signal flags, and help satisfy that universal  hunger.&quot;<br />In this context, I summarized partially only four of the  thirty-seven essays written by talented thinkers as follows:<br />I. Peter F.  Drucker writes: &quot;The three people from whom I learned the most in my  work were all very different. The first two were exceptionally demanding;  the third was exceptionally brillant. All three taught me a lot...Five  lessons I learned from those remarkable men still apply today:<br />1. Treat  people differently, based on their strengths.<br />2. Set high standards, but  give people the freedom and responsibility to do their job.<br />3.  Performance review must be honest, exacting, and an integral part of the  job.<br />4. People learn the most when teaching others.<br />5. Effective  leaders earn respect-but they don't need to be liked.<br />II. Doris Kearns  Goodwin lists ten lessons from the stories of Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy,  and Franklin Roosevelt for leaders of today's organizations.<br />1. Timing is  (almost) everything.<br />2. Anything is possible if you share the glory.<br />3.  Trust, once broken, is seldom restored.<br />4. Leadership is about building  connections.<br />5. Leaders learn from their mistakes.<br />6. Confidence-not  just in oneself-counts.<br />7. Effective partnerships reqire devotion to  one's partners.<br />8. Renewal comes from many sources.<br />9. Leaders must be  talent brokers.<br />10. Language is one's mostpowerful tool.<br />III. Warren  Bennis argues: &quot;I belive that behind every Great Man is a Great Group,  an effective partnership. And making up every Great Group is a unique  construct of strong, often eccentric individuals. So the question for  organizations is, How do you get talented, self-absorbed, often arrogant,  incredibly bright people to work together?&quot; And he suggests ten  principles common to all Great Groups:<br />1. At the heart of every Great  Groups is a shared dream.<br />2. They manage conflict by abandoning  individual egos to the pursuit of the dream.<br />3. They are protected from  the &quot;suits&quot;.<br />4. They have a real or invented enemy.<br />5. They  view themselves as winning underdogs.<br />6. Members pay a personal  price.<br />7. Great Groups make strong leaders.<br />8. Great Groups are the  product of meticulous recruiting.<br />9. Great Groups are usually  young.<br />10. Real artists ship.<br />IV. J. Richard Hackman identifies a  number of mistakes that managers make in setting up and leading work  teams.<br />1. Use a team for work that is better done by individuals. <br />2.  Call the performing unit a team but really manage members as  individuals.<br />3. Fall off the authority balance team.<br />4. Dismantle  existing organizational structures so that teams will be fully empowered to  accomplish the work.<br />5.

Research in organization  theory suggests that organizations create and use information in three  strategic arenas. First, organizations interpret information about the  environment in order to construct meaning about what is happening to the  organization and what the organization is doing. Second, they create new  knowledge by converting and combining the expertise and know-how of their  members in order to learn and innovate. Finally, they process and analyze  information in order to select and commit to appropriate courses of  action...The book has the following objectives. First, it analyzes and  compares the principal modes by which an organization uses information  strategically to make sense of its changing environment, create new  knowledge for innovation, and make decisions that reflect past learning and  ongoing adaptation. Second, it examines the structure and dynamics of  information seeking...Third, it proposes a new framework of the knowing  organization (from the Preface).&quot;<br />In this context, Chun Wei Choo  divides his book into seven chapters, and he:<br />* introduces the theories  of organizations as sense-making communities, knowledge-creating  enterprises, and decision-making systems, and show how the three modes of  information as sense making, knowledge creating, and decision making use  complement each other by supplying some of the missing pieces necessary for  each mode to function.<br />* identifies and relates the major elements that  influence the behavior of the individual when seeking (starting, chaining,  browsing, differentiating, monitoring, extracting, verifying, and ending)  and using (selection and processing of information) information.<br />* shows  how organizations, as social systems of people, structures, and processes,  use information to make sense of the environment, create new knowledge for  learning and innovation, and make decisions that enable action.<br />*  examines the theory and process underlying the knowing organization.<br />*  describes the tensions as tensions in sense making, tensions in knowledge  creating, and tensions in decision making that are inherent in the knowing  processes, and how the dynamics of balancing these tensions enable the  knowing organization to be effective in the short term, and adaptive over  the long term.<br />This book is highly recommended for HR and IT  professionals.	2000-05-22

The incisive thinkers and remarkable  leaders who have contributed to the journal and to this book open doors,  spark ideas, raise signal flags, and help satisfy that universal  hunger.&quot;<br />In this context, I partially summarized only five of the  thirty-seven essays written by thirty-seven talented thinkers.<br />I. Peter  F. Drucker writes: &quot;the three people from whom I learned the most in  my work were all very different. The first two were exceptionally  demanding; the third was exceptionally brillant. All three taught me a  lot...Five lessons I learned from those remarkable men still apply  today:<br />1. Treat people differently, based on their strengths.<br />2. Set  high standards, but give people the freedom and responsibility to do their  job.<br />3. Performance review must be honest, exacting, and an integral part  of the job.<br />4. People learn the most when teaching others.<br />5. Effective  leaders earn respect-but they don't need to be liked.<br />II. Doris Kearns  Goodwin lists ten lessons from the stories of Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy,  and Franklin Roosevelt for leaders of today's organizations:<br />1. Timing is  (almost) everything.<br />2. Anything is possible if you share the glory.<br />3.  Trust, once broken, is seldom restored.<br />4. Leadership is about building  connections.<br />5. Leaders learn from their mistakes.<br />6. Confidence-not  just in oneself-counts.<br />7. Effective partnership require devotion to  one's partners.<br />8. Renewal comes from many sources.<br />9. Leaders must be  talent brokers.<br />10. Language is one's most powerful tool.<br />III. John P.  Kotter argues: &quot;No organization today-large or small, local or  global-is immune to change. To cope with new technological, competitive,  and demographic forces, leaders in every sector have sought to alter  fundamentally the way their organizations do business. These change efforts  have paraded under many banners-total quality management, reengineering,  restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, turnarounds. Yet according to most  assessments, few of these efforts accomplish their goals. Fewer than  fifteen of the one hundred or more companies I have studied have  successfully transformed themselves.&quot; Hence, he lists eight critical  steps to transform your organization:<br />1. Establish a sense of  urgency.<br />2. Form a powerful guiding coalition.<br />3. Create a vision.<br />4.  Communicate the vision.<br />5. Empower others to act on the vision.<br />6. Plan  for and create short-term wins.<br />7. Consolidate improvements and produce  still more change.<br />8. Institutionalize new approaches.<br />IV. Warren  Bennis argues: &quot;I believe that behind every Great Man is a Great  Group, an effective partnership. And making up every Great Group is a  unique construct of strong, often eccentric individuals. So the question  for organizations is, How do you get talented, self-absorbed, often  arrogant, incredibly bright people to work together?&quot; And he suggests  ten principles common to all Great Groups: <br />1. At the heart of every  Great Group is a shared dream.<br />2. They manage conflict by abandoning  individual egos to the pursuit of the dream.<br />3. They are protected from  the &quot;suits&quot;.<br />4. They have a real or invented enemy.<br />5. They  view themselves as winning underdogs.<br />6. Members pay a personal  price.<br />7. Great Groups make strong leaders.<br />8. Great Groups are the  product of meticulous recruiting.<br />9. Great Groups are usually  young.<br />10. Real artists ship.<br />V. J. Richard Hackman identifies a number  of mistakes that managers make in setting up and leading work  teams.<br />Mistake 1. Use a team for work that is better done by  individuals.<br />Mistake 2. Call the performing unit a team but really manage  members as individuals.<br />Mistake 3. Fall off the authority balance  team.<br />Mistake 4. Dismantle existing organizational structures so that  teams will be fully empowered to accomplish the work.<br />Mistake 5. Specify  challenging team objectives, but skimp on organizational  supports.<br />Mistake 6. Assume that members already have all the skills they  need to work well as a team.<br />I highly recommend this excellent collection  as a whole.	2000-05-22

We are in time when the competencies of  individual HR practitioners must be developed to better support the  business organization. If the HR function does not meet the challenges of  today's global business environment, it is danger of being outsourced or  cut out completely...(In fact), some organizations are cutting costs in  Human Resources and outsourcing HR because they still see it largely as a  transactional and reactive function that can effectively be done by outside  organizations. Others are building more strategic partnerships between  line, management, and HR experts and are creating a consultative role for  HR to cope with the rapidly changing business realities. They recognize  that HR can no longer be simply transactional and administrative, but must  be far more proactive in assisting senior management plan for the  future.&quot;<br />In this context, Margaret Butteriss and other  contributors:<br />* discuss, based on a data from interviews with top  Canadian executives and HR professionals, how organizations are being  changed by globalization, competition, and advances in information  technology, and identify seven key ways in which HR can contribute to  dealing with changes in the marketplace and workplace.<br />* examine general  and technical competencies required by HR professionals as they take on  more strategic roles.<br />* define standard measurement ways to measure the  effectiveness of HR in organizations such as functional measures,  operational measures, and strategic measures.<br />* provide an example of a  company that redefined its HR function in order to meet its current and  future business needs.<br />* identify the fundamentals of Change Management,  particularly HR's role.<br />* look at components of executive leadership  development, including the required infrastructure, the process of talent  identification, and the selection and resourcing of candidates to fill  vacant leadership positions.<br />* discuss why most performance management  systems are either questionable or fail to reach the required  objectives.<br />* define competency and examine the history of competency,  and examine the development of competencies and competency scales, both in  individuals and job families.<br />* define the underlying principles  necessary for a compensation strategy that supports business direction in a  changing business environment.<br />* look at how individual pay is decided,  whether it be on the performance of the individual, the division or  department, the team, or the the entire organization.<br />* discuss how HR  professionals can contribute to corporate success by taking a new approach  to compensation, and introduce ,based on a case study, the concept of  competency-based pay.<br />I highly recommend.	2000-05-22

The New Competition&quot;, N. Fredric Crandall and Marc J.  Wallace, JR. write, &quot;encompasses a global economy and is driven by  information rather than product and by time rather than space, creating a  revolution in the way we do business...The New Competition has emerged in  three parallel developments: (1). Former competitors forming alliances to  command the market, (2). New marriages of technology, markets, and  opportunity, and (3). The creation of new business entities that replace  traditional ones, defining the entire length of a value chain-a form of  organization that has been characterized as the virtual organization...The  virtual organization requires a virtual workplace. The virtual workplace is  a work environment where goods and services are created and delivered  joining employees beyond the traditional bounds of time and place.  Technology is a foundation for the virtual workplace, creating the means  for innovations in working relationship such as teams of people who work  together via teleconferencing or transfer work in progress from one venue  to the next across time zones to keep work going on a continuous  basis.&quot;<br />In this context, in Chapter Six, they examine how the role  of rewards and compensation changes when an organization evolves from a  traditional to a virtual workplace. Firstly, they define job in a  traditional organization and argue: &quot;The job concept served  traditional organizations well. Work has been organized in a  command-and-conrol bureaucracy characterized by functional specifications  and hierarchy. It is a paradigm shaped by early twentieth-century thinking  of Max Weber and Frederick W. Taylor, implemented by Henry Ford, and cast  in the legislation of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s.  Unfortunatelly the paradigm no longer serves usbecause the job has died.  Globalization of production and technological revolution have forced us  into a post-industrial model for producing goods and services. The work  designs of the virtual workplace have forced companies to tear down  hierarchy do away with functional specialization, and organize all  activities according to entire business processes that cut across  traditional departments and occupations.&quot;<br />Hence, they compare  traditional and virtual base pay models, and argue that in the new  workplace people are paid not for the job they hold but for the role they  are expected to play.<br />I. Base Pay Model in the Traditional  Workplace:<br />1. Unit of analysis: Job<br />2. Basis for determining value: Job  evaluation<br />3. What pay is for: Work performed<br />4. Base pay progression:  (a). Modest movement within grades to mid-point. Pay is controlled to  mid-point. (b). Promotion required for significant advancement.<br />5. Base  pay structure: Many narrow grades, hierarchically arranged.<br />II. Base Pay  Model in the Virtual / New Paradigm Workplace:<br />1. Unit of analysis:  Personal role<br />2. Basis for determining value: Personal evaluation<br />3.  What is pay for: Capacity to perform<br />4. Base pay progression: Significant  movement from entry rate to target rate based on capacity acquisition.<br />5.  Base pay structure: Few, broad bands<br />Finally, they define this new  paradigm as skill-or-competency-based pay, and argue: &quot; the base pay  progression policy that best serves the virtual workplace is skill-or  competency-based pay.<br />I highly recommend.	2000-05-22

How can I lead my company, which has lost its way and greatly  depleted its resources, to revitalize itself for competitive excellence?  How can our recently merged companies or functions overcome business and  cultural differences? Or, more simply, now that I am in a position to do  so, how can I effectively take charge of my organization and help people  develop a new agenda to lead us through the next phase of its development?  These questions, and more, have found successful resolution through the  framework for leading corporate transformation described in this book (R.  H. Miles).&quot;<br />In this context, in the first part of this book, Robert  H. Miles offers a framework for leading corporate transformation. This  framework, as stated by Miles, identifies the major/required tasks that a  leader-indeed, that leaders at all leves in the organization-must perform  to achieve successful transformation without exposing the corporation to  unacceptable risk :<br />I. Generate Energy for Transformation<br />* Confront  reality<br />* Create and reallocate resources<br />* Raise the bar<br />* Model  desired behaviors <br />II. Develop a Vision and Business Success Model<br />*  Develop a strategic vision<br />* Model business success<br />* Analyze the total  system: current vs. vision states<br />* Identify the gaps<br />* Focus on a few  transformation initiatives<br />III. Align the Organization<br />*  Restructure<br />* Implement infrastructure<br />* Reshape the culture<br />* Build  core competencies<br />IV. Create a Transformation Process Architecture<br />*  Educate and involve<br />* Create coordination and feedback mechanisms<br />*  Communicate progress<br />* Fill transformation skill gaps<br />According to R.  H. Miles these elements of the framework provide not only a platform for  launching a corporate transformation, but also for managing transitions  from one phase of transformation to the next en route to the vision  state.<br />I highly recommend.	2000-05-18

As stated by series editor Manuel London, &quot;the current volume, edited by Allen I. Kraut and Abraham K. Korman, explores how changes in the work world during the last two decades have altered the nature of human resource  management (HRM). Economic, global, and marketplace changes have led to  flatter organizational structures, reengineered jobs, team processes, and  methods for continuous, customer-driven quality improvement. The chapters  in this volume show how the practice of HRM and I/O psychology has adapted  to these challenges and contributed to organization development...The  chapters -all written by expert practitioners who value research- describe  success stories and emerging strategies in key areas of HRM such as career  development, recruitment and selection, performance appraisal, teamwork,  leadership development, and organizational surveys.&quot;<br />In this  context, as a sample, in third chapter of this book, &quot;Is Job Analysis  Dead, Misunderstood, or Both? : New Forms of Work Analysis and  Design&quot;, Juan I. Sanches and Edward L. Levine argue that the  obsolescence of job analysis is really the obsolescence of some of the  traditional forms and applications of job analysis. Thus, they :<br />(1).  discuss the basis of traditional job analysis,<br />(2). outline the business  trends that have called that basis into question,<br />(3). propose revisions  in traditional job analysis practices in line with emerging trends.<br />They  begin by comparing and contrasting 'the factors' that shaped the job  analysis methodology that has been used successfully in the past with their  emerging counterparts, which make some traditional forms of job analysis  obselete.<br />I. Traditional Factors :<br />* Division of labor and clear-cut  labor-management distinction.<br />* Static job.<br />* Minimal interaction with  coworkers.<br />* Accountability to superiors.<br />* One-way relation to  technology.<br />* Long-term employement.<br />* Cultural homogeneity.<br />*  Tolerance for budgetary slack.<br />II. Emerging Factors :<br />*  Cross-functional responsibilities and blurring of labor-management  distinction.<br />* Dynamic work assignments.<br />* Maximal interaction with  coworkers.<br />* Accountability to internal and external customers.<br />*  Two-way relation to technology.<br />* Short-term employement.<br />* Cultural  diversity.<br />* Cost containment.<br />After describing these factors, and  changes in work analysis and its building blocks : sources of data, methods  of data collection, types of data, and level of analysis; finally, they  suggest that unlike traditional job analysis, instead of being  overconcerned with documenting molecular tasks and job boundaries new forms  of work analysis should focus on contributing useful inputs to the process  of continuous organizational innovation.<br />Not only this chapter, but this  book as a whole is higly recommended for HR practitioners.	2000-05-15

As stated by series editor Eduardo Salas, &quot;this volume is about the practice of selection strategies in rapidly changing organizations. A timely topic for both practitioners and scientists. Jerard F. Kehoe was  able to assemble an excellent group of industrial / organizational  psychologists to write about how selection interfaces with individual,  social, and organizational factors. The chapters describe how demographic  changes, team-membership, cultural differences, legislation, and social  policy influence the selection strategy process. The chapters offer many  useful and practical insights about the practice of selection strategies in  an every-changing organizational world. This volume is invaluable to those  concerned with applying selection processes in organizations and to those  who research selection systems.&quot;<br />In this context, as a sample, in  fourth chapter of this book, &quot;Managing 'Customers' of Selection  Processes&quot;, Stephen W. Gilliland and Bennett Cherry (1) focus on  managing the customers of selection, (2) specifically consider the  perspective of each customer group in each of the three stages of the  selection process (that is, development, assessment, feedback), and (3)   finally conclude the chapter with some summary recommendations for  maintaining as successful customer-based selection system.<br />(1). Who Are  the Customers? : In this section, Gilliland and Cherry define customers of  selection, and their needs, desires, and goals for selection are summarized  as :<br />a. Line Managers :<br />* Accurate and informative indicators of     applicant potential.<br />* Quick and easy-to-use selection process.<br />*  Flexibility and accommodation of selection procedures.<br />* Perceived  validity of selection process.<br />b. Coworkers :<br />* Accurate and  informative indicators of applicant potential.<br />* Input into the selection  decision-making process.<br />* Perceived validity of selection process.<br />c.  Applicants :<br />* Appropriate hiring decision.<br />* Unbiased, job-related  selection process that gives them a chance to demonstrate their potential  .<br />* Honest and sensitive interpersonel treatment.<br />* Timely and  informative feedback.<br />(2). Managing Customers of Selection : After  defining the stages of a customer-based selection system as development,  assessment, and feedback, in this section, they consider how to manage the  needs of the customers during each of these selection stages.<br />(3).  Summary Recommendations : In this section, they made the following  recommendations for managing the customers of selection.<br />a. For Line  Managers and Coworkers :<br />* Communicate how and why a new selection system  is being developed.<br />* Involve line managers in development and  administration of the selection system.<br />* Train line managers in the use  of the selection system and in effective interviewing and decision  making.<br />* Simplify the assessment process to ease administration.<br />*  Solicit feedback on the effectiveness of and satisfaction with the  selection system.<br />b. For Applicants :<br />* Include applicant concerns in  the development of the selection system.<br />* Provide applicants with an  understanding of what the selection process entails and how it was  developed.<br />* Make sure the selection procedures are job-related and  unbiased, and give applicants a chance to demonstrate their potential.<br />*  Make sure the selection process is consistently administered.<br />* Treat  applicants with honesty and respect, and allow for two-way  communication.<br />* Deliver timely and informative feedback to applicants on  the hiring decision.<br />* Solicit feedback from applicants on their  reactions to the selection process.<br />Not only this chapter, but this book  as a whole is highly recommended for HR practitioners.	2000-05-15

We  identify five knowledge enablers- (1)instill a knowledge vision, (2)manage  conversations, (3)mobilize knowledge activists, (4)create the right  context, and (5)globalize local knowledge- weaving in detailed stories from  Siemens, Skandia, Shiseido, Sony, Phonak, Adtranz, General Electric, and  other companies (such as 3M, Nokia, Intel, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Lotus,  PricewaterhouseCoopers, Hoffmann-La Roche, and Glaxo Wellcome).&quot;<br />In  this context Von Krogh, Ichijo, and Nonaka :<br />* describe and discuss  individual and organizational barriers to knowledge creation.<br />* examine  the three pitfalls of a knowledge-management approach in more detailed  :<br />Pitfall-1. Knowledge management relies on easily detectable,  quantifiable information.<br />Pitfall-2. Knowledge management is devoted to  the manufacture of tools.<br />Pitfall-3. Knowledge management depends on a  knowledge officer.<br />* present the three counter premises of knowledge  enabling :<br />Premise-1. Knowledge is justified true belief, individual and  social, tacit and explicit.<br />Premise-2. Knowledge depends on your  perspective.<br />Premise-3. Knowledge creation is a craft, not a science.<br />*  present more general ideas about care in organizations and the role it  plays in knowledge creation.<br />* focus on how a company's strategy can be  connected to knowledge enabling.<br />* discuss how campanies develop their  knowledge visions. <br />* describe the five key &quot;knowledge  enablers&quot; more precisely.<br />As sequel to &quot;The Knowledge-Creating  Company / I.

Marquardt writes, &quot;to provide a comprehensive overview of the true principles and successful practices of action learning as it has emerged on a worldwide  basis...For many organizations around the world, action learning has  quietly become one of the most powerful action-oriented, problem-solving  tools, as well as their key approach to individual, team, and organization  development. Organizations as diverse as Exxon, General Electric, TRW,  Motorola, Arthur Andersen, General Motors, the U.S. Army, Marriott, and  British Airways now use action learning for solving problems, developing  global executives, identifying strategic competitive advantages, reducing  operating costs, creating performance management systems, and becoming  learning organizations.&quot;<br />In this context M. Marquardt :<br />* explores  the context and history of action learning, illustrating why action  learning is so important in today's world of rapid change and chaos.<br />*  examines the six distinct interactive components (1.the problem, 2.the  group, 3.questioning and reflective process, 4.the commitment to taking  action, 5.the commitment to learning, 6.the facilitator.) that make action  learning programs work effectively and thus be so valuable to  organizations, teams, and individuals.<br />* describes the types of action  learning programs, the possible roles of participants, and the life cycle  of an action learning group.<br />* explores the five extraordinary,  synchronous ways in which action learning can be applied :<br />1. problem  solving<br />2. creating a learning organization<br />3. team building<br />4.  leadership development<br />5. personal and career growth<br />* examines how  action learning may need to be modified in work with multicultural or  cross-cultural environments.<br />* explores the various options and choices  that enable an organization to tailor action learning and thus gain optimum  benefitsfrom it.<br />* explores the key questions that an organization needs  to ask relative to set advisors.<br />* identifies ten of the most common  pitfalls and makes suggestions for avoiding them.<br />* examines group  assessment of the action learning meetings as well as organizational  evaluation of the overall action learning program.<br />As argued by Reg  Revans, father of action learning, &quot;the wisdom inherent in action  learning is even more important in dealing with the rapid changes in  today's world. And action learning can be used anywhere in the world. It is  my hope that this book can bring the wisdom of action learning to all  cultures and all kinds of people.&quot;<br />I highly recommend.	2000-05-08

Radically different organizational  architectures are emerging in much the same fashion as new schools of  physical architecture...In order to perform effectively, the new  architectures require new collateral technologies. In particular, they  demand new leadership skills, new methods for selecting and developing key  people, new human resources approaches to assessment and reward, and new  techniques for enhancing the organization's capacity for collective  learning...In this book, we consider a number of leading companies in the  United States and around the world that are developing their own versions  of the new architecture.(pp.7-10).&quot;<br />Throughout this study, David A.  Nadler and Michael L. Tushman present a comprehensive, balanced approach to  design that recognizes the technical requirements, human dynamics, and  strategic demands of successful design in any organization or business  unit. <br />Nadler and Tushman summarize the ten basic themes that capture the  essence of this book :<br />1. Organizational capabilities represent the last  truly sustainable source of competitive advantage.<br />2. Organizational  architecture provides a conceptual framework for employing strategic design  to develop organizational capabilities.<br />3. At every level of the  organization, design constitutes one of the most powerful tools for shaping  performance.<br />4. Regardless of its scope or scale, there are certain  fundamental concepts that apply to design at every level.<br />5. There is a  logical sequence of actions and decisions that applies to the design  process at any level of the organization.<br />6. There are no perfect design;  the design process requires the weighing of choices and the balancing of  trade-offs.<br />7.The best designs draw upon the knowledge, experience, and  expertise of people throughout the organization.<br />8. Even the best designs  can be derailed by ill-planned, poorly executed implementation.<br />9. As  continual redesign becomes a fact of life, successful organizations will  learn to create flexible architectures that can accommodate constant  change.<br />10. Flexible architectures and designs that leverage competitive  strengths will themselves become the ultimate competitive weapons.    <br />I  highly recommend.	2000-05-04

So it  is time for both managers and management academics to throw out the old  paradigm and to start experimenting with new, more fertile possibilities  (see pp.121-140).&quot;<br />* C.K.Prahalad argues : &quot;In the new  millennium, the methods and skills needed to manage large and small  organizations will be different from those needed to be successful during  the past three decades. Newer concepts and tools will emerge.&quot; He then  discusses the emerging nature of managerial work and suggests that this  transformation of managerial work will demand basic organizational  innovations (see pp.141-150).<br />* P.M.Senge and K.H.Kaufer write :  &quot;Faced with profoundly new business realities-unprecedented demands  from global competition, new technologies, emerging markets, possible  mergers and alliances, and growing environmental pressures-many companies  are falling back on old leadership habits...Rather than making executives  less important, we argue that understanding leadership communities brings  the unique roles of executive leaders into much clearer relief, as it does  the roles for other types of leaders- all of whom will ultimately depend  upon one another in creating successful 21st century enterprises (see  pp.186-204).&quot;<br />* D.Ulrich suggests : &quot;Since the future is  unpredictable but coming anyway, we need to prepare as best we can by  projecting about context, organization and people.&quot; He then gives his  observations about the contextual factors impacting on organizations, how  organizations will operate, and how individuals must prepare themselves  today to respond tomorrow (see pp.235-249).<br />* R.Moss Kanter argues :  &quot;Brainpower is to the global information economy as oil was to the  industrial economy...Business leaders increasingly understand that one of  their new roles in the 21st century is to contribute to creating such  environments in the communities in which their companies operate.  World-class leaders will be cosmopolitans who avoid insularity, enjoy the  challenge of confronting new and different ideas, encourage  cross-fertilization and learning across boundaries, and support their  people in developing and using their brainpower in pursuit of innovation  (see pp.250-261).&quot;<br />I highly recommend.	2000-05-01

The complexity of jobs requires that employees have feedback from a  variety of constituencies, not just their supervisor, who has traditionally  been the source of feedback and performance review. Also, organizational  restructuring and downsizing place the burden of development on the  employee. Today's organizations generally do not provide structured career  paths with promises of job security and advancement. Rather, individuals  need to be responsible for their continued ability to add value to the  organization. The organization enables this by providing a variety of  resources, which often include access to training to improve current job  performance and prepare for tomorrow; 360-degree feedback may be part of  this development process (from the Introduction pp. 2-3).&quot;<br />In this  context, as a collection of chapters addressing the broad issue of using  360-degree feedback for individual and organizational development, authors  from Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) :<br />* review origins of  360-degree feedback in organizations.<br />* discuss the standards and  dimensions of performance that are rated in a 360-degree survey.<br />* focus  on the quality of the ratings and the information they convey to the  feedback recipients.<br />* examine the outcomes of the 360-degree feedback  for performance improvement and development.<br />* describe the kind of  program (Leadership Development Program) that can enhance the 360-degree  feedback process by presenting a case study.<br />* consider the benefits of  the 360-degree feedback process for organizations and how current practices  affect these benefits.<br />* describe the internal and external forces affect  the process of 360-degree feedback.<br />* examine the advantage of involving  customers in the 360-degree feedback process and in the development of  organizational strategy.<br />* show how 360-degree feedback can be an  integral part of establishing a learning culture.<br />* focus on standard  360-degree feedback instruments such as : (1) the questionnaire, (2) the  scored feedback (or results), and (3) the administrative process.<br />*  discuss what is involved in applying the 360-degree feedback process in  different countries in a multinational organization.<br />* focus on using  360-degree feedback surveys to measure what happens as a result of an  intervention rather than using the data from 360-degree feedback to  identify a needed development intervention.<br />&quot;In conclusion&quot;,  W.Tornow and M.London write, &quot;organizations can maximize the value of  360-degree feedback as a process that will create successful individual and  organizational development. This can be done by being intentional and  systemic when designing and implementing a 360-degree feedback program such  that it fits with the intended purpose, is aligned with the business goals  and strategies, and is integrated with other HR systems (from the  Conclusion p.258).&quot;<br />I highly recommend.	2000-05-01

A number of other approaches can and have been used. Futurist methodologies have been applied to study the 'state of the art' and the future and have  through surveys of thought leaders identified likely priorities for the  future. Our approach&quot;, D.Ulrich, M.R.Losey, and G.Lake write, &quot;to  thinking about the future of HR parallels closely and draws heavily on a  methodology used by F.Hesselbein, M.Goldsmith, and R.Beckhard (Leader of  the Future, Organization of the Future)...We have tried to select thought  leaders in three groups : academics who study and write HR issues,  consultants who offer advice and councel on an array of HR issues, and HR  professionals who practice the craft of HR in leading companies...Each of  the contributors to this book was asked to write an original ten-page essay  on 'the future of HR' as he or she chose to define it...Our hope in this  book was for a unique variety of opinion : positive, negative; broad,  narrow; optimistic, pessimistic; provocative, discreet; calls for change,  calls for status quo (from the Introduction pp.2-3).&quot;<br />In this  context, Ulrich, Losey, and Lake organize the 37 essays into six general  sections.Each of these sections deals with a series of questions such as  :<br />Section I :<br />* What is the strategy of HR?<br />* What are the products  and services of HR?<br />* How should HR be organized to ensure that the  strategy is executed?<br />Section II :<br />* What are the future deliverables  from HR work?<br />* What are the metaphors of the HR professional of the  future?<br />* What are the actions for future HR professionals?<br />Section III  :<br />* What is the history of HR?<br />* What of the past should be left in the  past, and what should be adapted for the future?<br />* What set of conditions  will create a new future?<br />Section IV :<br />* Where should HR work be  done?<br />* How do we measure HR work?<br />* How do HR executives align HR work  both inside and outside?<br />Section V :<br />* How is intellectual capital  operationalized?<br />* How can HR practices be created that motivate and  commit employees?<br />* What is the impact of humane treatment of  employees?<br />Section VI :<br />* What are the HR implications of a more global  business?<br />* How can HR practices help a business develop a more global  outlook?<br />* What are the competencies of global leaders?<br />&quot;If our  purpose is to propose a debate about the future&quot;, D.Ulrich writes,  &quot;it is better to end with questions than with answers. Questions  elicit new frameworks, approaches, and alternatives, so, the final two  questions we would ask (with our answer) are :<br />* Do you want to play in  this always changing and at times unclear future?<br />* Are you having  fun?<br />Without a doubt, all the authors in this volume and many others of  the best HR professionals we know answer with a resounding 'yes'  (p.360).&quot;<br />I highly recommend.	2000-05-01

It emphasizes that design is a key task of the leader. It suggests that effective organizations are necessary for competitiveness and they are a growing  source for competitive advantage. The focus of the book is therefore on  equipping leaders with the understanding and the tools necessary to create  organizations that are superior to those of their competitors.&quot;<br />In  this context J. Galbraith :<br />* examines the forces (buyer power, variety,  change, and speed) that are shaping organizations.<br />* presents the  organizational design framework in the form of &quot;the star model&quot;.  In the star model, design policies fall into five categories : <br />(1)  Strategy, <br />(2) Structure,<br />(3) Processes,<br />(4) Rewards, <br />(5)  People.<br />* looks at policy areas/dimensions that determine the structure  of an organization : specialization, shape, distribution of power, and  departmentalization.<br />* discusses the lateral processes as a  multidimentional aspects and the ability to be responsive to products,  customers, functions, geographies, and work flow processes.<br />* focuses on  three organizational design models : functional integrators, the  distributed organization, and the front/back hybrid structure.<br />* examines  virtual corporation as a network of independent companies.<br />&quot;In  conclusion&quot;, J. Galbraith writes, &quot;I wish to emphasize once again  the role of leader. I see the leader as a decision shaper rather than a  decision maker.

Fit, we have argued, is not merely important; it is crucial. With fit comes  fame, with misfit comes failure...We have shown that fit is a simple  concept but not a simple process. To achieve strategic fit, organizations  must create, understand, develop, and sustain a distinctive competence that  adds high value to goods or services the market desires...The obvious  lesson here is the same one we have been emphasizing throughout this book.  In the competitive world of today and tomorrow, competencies must be  investment-based. They must rest on the sustained investment of money and  time, which build ever-increasing skills and know-how as well as the  capability to use them to their fullest (pp. 186-199).&quot;<br />In this  context R. Miles and C. Snow :<br />* discuss concept of fit.<br />* describe the  external fit between the firm and its environment, and the internal fit of  organization structure, management systems, and managerial ideology to a  chosen strategy. <br />* discuss the companies (such as Carnegie Steel, GM,  Sears, Roebuck, HP, and TRW) that pioneered the major organizational forms  that have appeared over the past hundred years or so.<br />* discuss today's  successful companies (such as GE, Wal-Mart, and Rubbermaid).<br />* discuss  organizational failure and its major causes, identifying two generic types  of failure. <br />* introduce and explore in detail the network organization  and its three main variations : the stable, dynamic, and internal network  as the 21st century's organization model.<br />* discuss mechanisms by which  required fit is achieved at all three levels of the network form : across  the entire network organization, among network firms in activated  organizations, and within each of the specific networkfirms (such as Nike,  Dell, Novell, and ABB).<br />* identify the forces pushing managers toward a  new philosophy of management (human investment model).<br />* discuss  companies that are struggling to redesign themselves-cutting costs,  downsizing, bringing in new management teams, and so on.<br />* describe how  total redesign may grow more costly in today's fast-paced world.<br />*  illustrate that fit is no longer an idealistic &quot;ought&quot; but an  economic &quot;must&quot;-not only within the firm but throughout the  network form and the total global economy.<br />Detailed discussion of the  concepts like technological change, cellular units, networks, network of  alliances, interorganizational teamwork, spherical organization, shared  knowledge see also William Halal's &quot;The Infinite Resource  (1998)&quot;, and &quot;The New Management (1998)&quot;.<br />I highly  recommend this &quot;must&quot; reading study.	2000-04-24

They can reach new heights of  accomplishment and greatness that had not been within their reach in the  past. From our knowledge of structure and how it works, we can begin anew  (from the Epilogue p.217).&quot;<br />'The Path of Least Resistance for  Managers' is a next generation of its predecessor, 'Corporate Tides'.  Throughout this current study, R. Fritz discusses the nine laws of  organizational structure :<br />1. Organizations either oscillate or  advance.<br />2. In organizations that oscillate, success is neutralized. In  organizations that advance, success succeeds.<br />3. If the organization's  structure remains unchanged, the organization's behavior will revert to its  previous behavior.<br />4. A change of structure leads to a change of the  organization's behavior.<br />5. When structural tension dominates an  organization, the organization will advance.<br />6. When structural conflicts  dominate an organization, oscillation will result.<br />7. An inadequate  organizational structure cannot be fixed. But you can move from an  inadequate structure to a suitable structure.<br />8. When a senior organizing  principle is absent, the organization will oscillate. When a senior  organizing principle is dominant, the organization will advance.<br />9. The  values that dominate an organization will displace other competing, lesser  values.<br />As written by Peter Senge, &quot;The Path of Least Resistance for  Managers is not the last word on structure. It is probably more like the  first word. But, for many people concerned with building organizations that  are more capable and more exciting, it is a great starting point.&quot;<br />I  highly recommend.	2000-04-19

We agree with Tom Peters that, &quot;If  you're not confused, you're not paying attention.&quot; Confusion abounds  as to prescriptions and proposed panaceas. Instead, our intention in this  book is both more modest and, we believe, potentially more helpful. The  book provides a framework, a sensemaking tool, a set of systematic steps,  and a methodology for helping managers and their organizations adopt the  demands of the environment. It focuses less on the right answers that it  does on the methods and mechanisms available to help managers change the  most fundamental elements of their organizations. It provides a way for  managers, at almost any level in an organization, to guide the change  process at the most basic level-the cultural level. It provides a  systematic strategy for internal or external change agents to facilitate  foundational change that can then support and supplement other kinds of  change initiatives.&quot;<br />In this context, Cameron and Quinn basically  :<br />* discuss the importance of understanding organizational culture and  its place in facilitating or inhibiting organizational improvement  efforts.<br />* provide the instrument (The Organizational Culture Assessment  Instrument-OCAI) for diagnosing organizational culture and instructions for  how to complete and score it. (OCAI produces an overall organizational  culture profile.)<br />* provide a more thorough explanation of the  theoretical framework (The Competing Values Framework) upon which the OCAI  is based. (The Competing Values Framework explains the underlying value  orientations that characterize organizations.)<br />* illustrate how  organizations designed a strategy to change their current culture to better  match their preferred culture. <br />* focus on the personal change needed to  support and facilitate culture change.<br />* provide an instrument  (Management Skills Assessment Instrument-MSAI) that helps managers identify  the key competencies they will need to develop or improve in order to  foster organizational culture change.<br />* provide suggestions for  initiating culture change in each of four types of cultures (market  culture, adhocracy culture, clan culture, hierarchy culture).<br />* provide  lists of suggestions for improving management skills and competencies  associated with the MSAI.<br />I highly recommend this invaluable study to all  executives.	2000-04-10

We were motivated to write the book because of a nagging feeling that something was missing in our ability to understand  organizations. This missing link was obviously very subtle-but also  extremely powerful. Along with other pioneers (Organizational Culture and  Leadership - E.Schein, Corporate Culture and Performance - J. Kotter / J.  Heskett, Built to Last - J. Collins / J. Porras), we ventured an idea about  what lay underneath the rational-technical veneer of business. We tagged  the phantom force 'corporate culture.'... In this, our new book, we  plan&quot;Deal and Kennedy write, &quot;to chronicle changes that have  occured-where they came from, why they happened, and their effect on  business cultures. We also offer suggestions for how corporations can be  revitalized in the wake of the grueling assaults since the early 1980s. Our  hope is that modern managers can use our book to find a balance between the  management actions needed to stay competitive and the human needs of  workers to belong to meaningful institutions.&quot;<br />In this context, with  their words, Deal and Kennedy basically :<br />* summarize the evidence that  has emerged since they first wrote about the importance of culture to  superior performance over the long haul.<br />* chronicle, one by one, the  forces that have chipped away at the culture of companies since the early  1980s.<br />* discuss the shareholder value movement and the impact it has had  on corporate decisionmaking.<br />* focus on downsizing, which has cut the  soul out of many corporations.<br />* show how outsourcing has emerged as the  new tool of cost cutters just when conventional cost-reduction approaches  have begun to run out of steam.<br />* explore how merger mania has forced the  most unlikely of combinations on workforces still reeling from the waves of  cost cutting that decimated them in the early 1990s.<br />* lookat how  computerization, potentially a tool for liberating workers from drudgery,  has instead isolated workers from one another and made them servants to  machines.<br />* discuss how the combination of these factors has decimated  traditional corporate cultures, replacing joy, commitment, and loyalty with  fear, alienation, and self-interest.<br />I highly recommend this study to all  executives.	2000-04-10

Rewarding Excellence is truly a fascinating study that is more about how to design and manage complex organizations than how to pay individuals.<br />As argued by Lawler, &quot;the old reward practices and  systems that worked well in nationally focused, bureaucratic,  capital-intensive, hierarchical, steady-state, near-monopoly corporations  such as the old General Motors and AT&amp;T simply don't fit the realities  of today's business environment. Dramatic change is needed, and it is not  difficult to identify what the key theme of today's reward systems should  be : a focus on rewarding excellence. Many factors argue for excellence  being the number-one focus of any organization's reward system, including  the ability to attract and retain the best people and to motivate the kind  of performance that an organization needs in order to succeed in the new  economy.&quot;<br />In this context, Lawler :<br />* argues that organizations  should adopt a new logic of organizing that recognizes the new competitive  realities and that today's key sources of competitive advantage are human  capital, core competencies, and organizational capabilities.<br />* shows why  the old reward systems, which focus on jobs and merit pay, don't do an  adequate job of developing and motivating either individuals or  organizations.<br />I highly recommend this excellent study to all executives  and HR professionals.	2000-02-28

The second audience  consists of 'line managers' who have heard a lot about 'this 360-degree  feedback stuff' and want to understand it well enough to determine if it is  the right approach for their organization. The third group consists of  'more experienced HR professionals' who would like a compherensive  reference work on 360-degree feedback that makes it easy to access the  information they are looking for without having to skim through dozens of  magazines and journal articles and textbooks.\\"<br />In this invaluable  study, authors organize their book into two parts :<br />(I). Preparing to use  360-degree feedback.<br />In this part, they :<br />i. offer basic information,  including a definition of 360-degree feedback and a brief overview of its  history and evolution.<br />ii. illustrate how a diverse group of companies  (real cases) has successfully used 360-degree feedback to address different  organizational issues, such as achieving business strategy, supporting  cultural change, fostering individual development, enhancing team  effectiveness, and identifying training and selection requirements.<br />iii.  discuss and compare the two most common methods for collecting 360-degree  feedback- interviews and questionnaires.<br />iv. focus on the use of  interviews alone to collect data or as a supplement to the data provided by  a questionnaire.<br />(II). Implementing a 360-degree feedback.<br />In this  part, they :<br />i. focus on how to administer a 360-degree feedback process  in a way that increases people's enthusiasm and ensures a high degree of  confidence in the results.<br />ii. describe and compare three methods for  delivering the feedback- group workshops, one-on-one meetings, and  self-study.<br />iii. review what needs to be done after the feedback is  collected and reviewed to ensure that recipients absurb the messages they  have been given and take appropriate action.<br />iv. discuss the benefits and  obstacles to using 360-degree feedback in HR management systems. <br />I  highly recommend this invaluable study.	1999-11-28

As written by J.O'Toole, \\"the purpose of this book is to identify clearly what leaders need to do in order to create high-performing, self-renewing organizations. While most leadership books focus on who  leaders are (their character, personality, style, and charisma), the accent  here is on what leaders do. The shift in emphasis has a practical intent :  although it is possible for you to learn from what others do, it is highly  unlikely that you can become someone you aren't.\\"<br />In this context,  O'Toole discusses and explores some concepts (like behavior, commitment,  communication, controlling, delegation, ego, globalism, hierarchy,  performance, repetition, team, trust, vision) with specific stories of some  great leaders such as Percy Barnevik (ABB), Jack Welch (GE), Richard  Teerlink (Harley-Davidson), Andrew Grove (Intel), Jan Carlzon (Scandinavian  Airlines), Michael Boxberger (Korn/Ferry), Robert Galvin (Motorola), Lou  Gerstner (IBM).<br />I higly recommend this alphabetically arranged practical  leadership guide.	1999-11-27

This willingness to deviate from traditional pay practices undoubtedly stemmed  from the fact that, because the old ways were often inadequate,  organizations sought new approaches to management. In the search for new  ways to manage, pay was one of a number of practices that underwent  scrunity and, in some cases, important chance... I wrote it because I  wanted to demonstrate how important pay system design choices are to the  ultimate effectiveness of an organization. I hope that it will put to rest  the idea that pay is simply a cost for an organization, make it clear that  making the right choices with respect to pay practices and processes is  vital to an organization's effectiveness, and establish that pay practices  can provide a definite competitive advantage (from the preface).&quot; <br />I  highly recommend this pioneering study to all HR professionals and  executives.	1999-09-30

As told by Marquardt &quot;two years ago, a large consulting firm that helps companies go global gave me a list of the ten most common questions its clients had  about globalization :<br />1. How do you create a global culture?<br />2. What  are the key components of globalization?<br />3. How do you create a global  mind-set?<br />4. What kinds of skills should we look for in global  managers?<br />5. Why do some people fail when going overseas?<br />6. How do we  establish a global training program?<br />7. What experiences should we give  our future leaders?<br />8. Should everyone in the organization become  globalized?<br />9. Is there an order or process in which a company should go  global?<br />10. Where can we go for help as we work toward  globalization?<br />This list inspired me to write this book, for I realized  that these questions had no easy answers and that only a handful of  companies had resolved even of these issues.&quot;<br />In this context, after  defining six components of his &quot;GlobalSuccess&quot; model, Marquardt  explores and illustrates these six components, namely corporate culture,  human resources, strategies, operations, structure and learning with best  practices of more than forty successful global companies, such as : GE,  Whirlpool, Colgate-Palmolive, Shell, Coca-Cola, Xerox, FedEx and HP.<br />I  highly recommend this study.

As the recognition of failure grows, U.S. companies are rapidly adopting  alternative reward systems in an attempt to deal with the challenges of an  increasingly competitive marketplace.&quot;<br />What's wrong with this  traditional reward system?<br />According to Belcher :<br />* tradional reward  systems compensate, but do not reward.<br />* traditional reward systems do  not reinforce teamwork.<br />* traditional reward systems do not support  strategic business priorities.<br />* traditional reward systems are  inflexible and are not reflective of business results.<br />Then,  variable/alternative pay system vs. traditional pay/reward  system.<br />Variable pay system is defined by Belcher as an alternative  compensation system that ties pay to business outcomes and supports a  participative management process. Cash payouts are based on a predetermined  measure or measures of group or organizational performance.<br />This study is  highly recommended for HR professionals and line managers.<br />See also :<br />*  The New Pay-J.

As stated by series editor Manuel London, &quot;the current volume, edited by J.W. Smither, provides state-of-the-art methods for performance management. The authors recognize the strategic, systemic role of a  performance appraisal process that evaluates employees or behaviors that  are important to organizational success and ties the appraisal results to  rewards and development...The goal is to design a performance appraisal  process that is fair and applies in different organizational situations and  contexts. New forms of appraisal are described, such as 360-degree survey  feedback and self-assessment. The book shows how to increase rater accuracy  and how to use appraisals for employee development. Overall, the book is  valuable resource to practitioners who want to evaluate and revamp their  appraisal systems to meet the changing needs of their  organizations.&quot;<br />In this context, as a sample, in thirteenth chapter  of this book &quot; Performance-Based Pay Plans&quot; Robert L. Heneman and  Maria T. Gresham focus the issue of how organizations can most effectively  make the link between performance appraisal and compensation and incentive  systems. As stated by them &quot; this requires an understanding of the  need for performance-based pay, the compensation context, types of reward  systems, design issues, and implementation issues.&quot; Thus each of this  topics have been examined as a literature review :<br />* types of pay and  performance plans : merit pay, team-based merit pay, skill-based pay,  competency-based pay, piece-rate pay, standart hour plan, group incentives,  suggestion systems, team recognition plans, gainsharing, sales commissions  and team sales plans, profit sharing and stock sharing, executive pay.<br />*  pay and performance plan effectiveness.<br />* design issue : integration with  business strategy and organizational culture, motivational considerations,  performance measurement levels.<br />* implementation issues : measurement,  fairness, communications.<br />Not only this chapter, but this book as a whole  is highly recommended for HR professionals.<br />See also : Maximizing the  Value of 360-Degree Feedback - Walter Tornow, Manuel London	1999-09-19

Whoever's in command makes the decisions, tells everyone what to do, barks  out their assigned tasks in fragmented, functional departments.

So, he (Ostroff) developed The Horizontal Organization about the  decade ago. Now, he says, the wold is definitely moving his  way.&quot;<br />This exceptional study starts with a vital question:  &quot;what will the organization of the future look like?&quot; Naturally,  Ostroff's answer is &quot;the Horizontal Organization&quot;.<br />With some  real life examples of various types of horizontal organizations like: Ford  Motor Company's Customer Service Division, the Xerox Corporation, the  General Electric plant in Salisbury, North Carolina, the Supply Management  Organization of Motorola's Space and System Technology Group, the Home  Finance Division of Barclays Bank, and the U.S. Occupational Health and  Safety Administration, Ostroff says &quot;my intention in this book is to  help readers understand what the Horizontal Organization is, how it works,  how it can be developed, and how to decide where it can be effectively  employed in any organization.&quot;<br />This exceptional study is must  reading for every business leader to understand the next millennium's  organizational structure.	1999-04-30
