I am sometimes sorry I cannot give less than one star to some books I have read (I read hundreds of books professionally). On this occasion I am sorry  I cannot give more than five stars.<br />It is absolutely superb, a perfect  jewel of a book which I had never heard of and discovered only by chance.  The heroic scale and width of concept, and I say this with all seriousness,  can be called Shakespearean. Splendid descriptive writing, action and  characters, with resonances at the very centre of great mytho-poetry. I  knew Poul Anderson was a great writer, but this took my breath away! The  best novel I have discovered in years!	1999-10-28
US	51339960	R2Q8QV7EH2YNSJ	0374524122	603875347	Crash: A Novel	Books	1	6	16	N	N	Trash	Ballard's writing has a certain descriptive fluency and some of his earlier short stories were  good. It is depressing to see a real talent turned to the production of pretentious, convulsive trash. Who needs a  guided tour through nasty, pointless obsessions?	1999-09-23
US	51339960	RWUVRI59E0LB5	0156443791	978079605	The Inheritors	Books	5	50	56	N	N	Complex, but worth the effort	This book is complex but worth the effort if you have an IQ of more than room-temperature.<br />The comment by a previous reviewer is worth taking up:&quot;And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I  happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm  sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of  people who are.&quot; Well, I'd agree, strongly. But it's not as simple as  that: the Homo Sapiens Sapiens in The Inheritors are not shown as  deliberately and strategically wiping out the last Homo Sapiens  Neanderthalus. Rather, they are terrified of them. They think they are  defending themselves against horrifying demons - why do they submit to the  discipline of the whip to drag the canoe up the portage? Plainly they are  half out of their minds with terror, which the Neanderthals cannot  comprehend. Further, the Neanderthals, though gentle and innocent, are  plainly inadequate. The process of their replacement by the Homo Sapiens  Sapiens, or Cro-Magnards, is cruel but it is not morbid. The Neanderthals,  it is clearly demonstrated, are at a dead-end (they are only a vestige of a  tribe at the beginning of the story). The survival of the Neanderthal  infant means some of their gentleness and innocence may survive into the  new world. It is actually a relief to get into the Cro-Magnards' minds in  the final chapter after the limitation of having to see everything from a  Neanderthal point of view. The Cro-Magnards are at one point called  &quot;the people of the fall&quot; - in religious terms they are the people  of the &quot;Fall&quot; indeed - Postlapsarian Man. Unlike the  Neanderthals, they do have knowledge of good and evil, and we see at the  end even the rudiments of conscience - which is not to say the end of the  Neanderthals is not utterly tragic.<br />Like all Golding's earlier works,  this is the exploration of difficult moral dilemnas. There are lessons  there but they are not easy.	1999-09-23

It seemed, to quote Nabokov, a violin in a void. Suddenly in 1989 I realised it is a prophecy about the Fall of Communism, its symbolism very  close to what actually happened: the State and its ideology - once wielding  real power and terror- have withered to an absurd shell, its rewards and  blandisments have someting of senile infantilism about them, only its power  as a death-dealer is apparently undiminished. The victim, Cincinnatus,  suddenly realises he has had enough, stands up and comes to his senses and  the whole idiotic apparatus of oppression crumbles to dust. It could have  been the story of Prague, Budapest, Warsaw or East Berlin in 1989. My  favourite Nabakov, it is a beautiful, haunting and unforgettable piece of  writing.	1999-09-01

He gradually rehabilitated himself and became a brilliant poet and novelist. &quot;The  Cure&quot; is the semi-autobiographical account of what happened to him and  his gradual discovery of normality and, through poetry, of beauty.  Harrowing but sublime and compassionate. It is a &quot;must-read&quot; but  not for children. As a criminal lawyer I am amazed by its insights as well  as the brilliance of the writing.	1999-08-26

This is SF as it should be and anyone who isn't enthralled must be suffering from a seriously deficient imagination and sense of wonder. This book is very  different to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; but they have three things  in common: (1) they restore faith in the survival of the story-teller's  craft, (2) they are both long books, and, (3) the reader finishes them  wishing they were a lot longer.	1999-08-26
US	51339960	R3AR82VFSIKLUL	0345323440	202451186	Footfall	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Non-stop excitement!	A brilliant and imaginative book, combining hard science, suspense and a fine line in plotting. The climactic space-battle is a real thriller, and the Aliens (as in Niven's Man-Kzin Wars) are neither too remote to be  unrecognisable nor too human to be unbelievable - they are aggressive and  ruthless but one feels some sympathy for them. But my favourite moment of  all was when the crusading investigative journalist was drowned in the  toilet. I have had the misfortune to know some journalists - even to have  been one - and I read that bit again and again with pure delight. What a  pity it didn't happen to certain others in this world! Unlike many SF  stories, but like the classics, this is one to read several times.	1999-08-26

The pigs (the Russian Communist Party)gradually and logically become worse than the inefficient old oppressors. The flaw I see  is that Orwell was still seeing Communism as a &quot;revolution  betrayed&quot;, not as something unavoidably and intrinsicly wrong and  doomed - as I think T.S. Eliot said, it is almost as if Orwell believed the  problem might have been solved by more public-spirited pigs. But despite  this criticism, Animal Farm is not only a great book, written in a perfect  and limpid style, but essential reading for understanding our world and the  history of the Twentieth Century, as well as a timeless warning.	1999-06-14
