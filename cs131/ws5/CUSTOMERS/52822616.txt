Nollner and his fellow 'mushers'  of Alaska in the early twentieth century had fascinating stories to tell of sled dogs, blizzards, ice flows and sledding near the Arctic Circle. These authors present an extensively researched and well written account of the 1925 race to bring diptheria serum to frozen Nome. It is an account of tough men, rough weather and extraordinary sled dogs at a time of great urgency for the few inhabitants wintering over along Norton Sound in northwestern Alaska. I was pleased to learn that the authors were inspired to write this book by reading the very same obituary of Edgar Nollner. This is a story well told and a very enjoyable reading experience.	2005-04-23

It is fascinating to read what was reported at that time in history. This compliation is well worth reading. It also contains a great general biographical summary of all of the reporters who's work appears in the book. These were interesting people in their own right.

Of course the explosion of Krakatoa in 1883 is a well known historical event, but Simon Winchester lets this story unfold with a treasure chest of valuable information so that the reader can better understand the events leading up to the cataclysm and the aftermath.

The movie was enjoyable and that provoked me to read her memoir. Getting beyond the fact that Robert Redford and Meryl Streep played the main characters, I became fascinated with the wonderful story and even more so the beautiful tapestry of language presented by the author in her book.  A few years ago I had the opportunity to travel to Nairobi, Kenya and first on my list of places to see and things to do was a visit to Karen Blixen's farmhouse. The house and a small portion of the original lands remain intact as a museum.  Although the area has been built up over the last 75+ years (the area is known as Karen in honor of the Baroness) there are still a few coffee plantations in the area and of course the Ngong mountains can be seen off in the distance. With this backround in mind I set off to read ISAK DINESEN : The Life of a Storyteller. I found the biography to be very comprehensive and exhaustively researched. \\"Exhaustively researched\\" not in a negative sense in that I found it fascinating to learn of the web of personalities that floated in and out of Karin Blixen's life including Hans Christen Andersen, President Theodore Roosevelt's son Kermit, Playwrite Arthur Miller, Prince Edward, George Bernard Shaw, Marilyn Monroe, Beryl Markham, Lord Delamere.... Moreover what she read and how much she read (and learned)are testament to what one can accomplish with 'self education' (especially so when there are no televisions or radios as was the case in the early days in British East Africa). The footnotes in this biography lead the reader into intriguing digressions.  For sure this is not an adventure book nor is it more of \\"Out of Africa\\". Karen Blixen led a very interesting life and accordingly it is the stuff of a very interesting biography that is well presented.	2005-01-10

He recreates a journey of historical (or fictional) past and from the keel up presents a wonderfully written account of the venture. I first read Severin's \\"The Brendan Voyage\\" in its re-creation of St. Brendan's North Atlantic crossing in the 8th century by oxen leather boat. Here again, the author re-creates an authentic ancient Arabian sailing boat for a journey from Oman to China (across the Indian Ocean and through the Malacca Strait). If you enjoy adventure stories of men, seamanship, a voyage against the elements...this is a book for you.	2005-01-01

He was a junior at Dartmouth studying \\"abroad\\" in Europe when in pursuit of his dream he travelled by airplane to Australia in the hope of securing a deckhand position on a four masted barque. I found that the story was very well presented. Not being a sailor myself, I found that the author more than adequately presented the nautical and seafaring jargon in easy to understand layman's terms.

But the tale in NOT told that well. This author could have served the reader well by writing more and quoting less. Paragraph after paragraph, page after page are just riddled with wholesale blocks of text taken &quot;boilerplate&quot; from the 'First American's' own awkward writings ( mispellings, convoluted sentences and all). No doubt the story of Josiah Harlan is a piece of history that should be told. This book, fails to present it well. And do note many of the other reader comments that favorably mention this work...they seem to infer this book offers great lessons about present day Afghanistan and how things work there. Nothing could be further from the truth. This book does not even pretend to do so. If you are interested in current events in that part of the world, go read Newsweek or Time.

This is a tale that can seemingly never be put to rest. Sir Wally Herbert is well qualified to research and write such a book as he himself dog sledded from Barrow Alaska, over the North Pole and back below the Arctic Circle to Spitzenberg in 1969. I thought the author was very even handed about his research and his fair presentation of the facts as he could best interpret them. I think however, Wally Herbert mistakenly concludes that Peary missed the Pole and presumably 'lied' about achieving his goal of being the first to arrive at the North Pole. After I read Herbert's book I took the opportunity to re-read a 1990 National Geographic article entitled &quot;New Evidence Places Peary at the Pole&quot;. In the article an independent body of geographic, photographic and navigational experts from the Navigation Foundation of Rockville, MD were presented with all of the navigational details of Peary's diary notations, his photographs, ocean depth soundings and preserved navigational equipment. The article makes a very convincing and cogent presentation that Peary's photographs (the angle and extent of shadows within the exposures) when measured photogrammetrically present unalterable proof that the photos were taken with five miles of the pole. Further the ocean depth sounding results taken on the way to the pole by Peary are currently consistent with what we now know about the actual depth of the Arctic Ocean along the meridian travelled by the Peary Expedition. Although National Geographic and the Navigation Foundation have in my opinion substantiated Peary's success in attaining the pole this is no discredit to Herbert's well written book that should be read by anyone interested in polar and arctic history.arctic history.	2001-07-31

Vilhjalmar Stefansson (a polar explorer, anthropologist and author) leads an ill fated attempt to survey the Arctic (1913-1918) in hopes of claiming an Arctic continent under the polar ice cap for the Dominion of Canada. In his rush to be first, Stefansson poorly organizes, proceeds with an ill fated plan (or no plan at all) and eventually abandons one of his three ships locked in the polar ice. This is the true story of the heroic efforts of Capt. Robert Bartlett of the doomed ship Karluk and his struggle to walk across seven hundred miles of polar ice from Wrangell Island to Siberia and his return by ship to rescue the abandoned survivors and crew. There is madness, murder malingering...starvation, frostbite and death. Although, in his time Stefansson somehow managed to receive praise and avoid  criticism for the realities of his abandonment of the Karluk, the true story of heroism and leadership is exemplified by Capt Bartlett. This author has done an excellent job in presenting a very suspenseful and thorough factual account of an amazing true tale.  Readers of the histories of Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott and other polar explorers will not be disappointed. Readers without any previous readings on Arctic exploration will also be pleased with this amazing history that is capably researched and well presented.

The book, however, moves from fantastic suspenseful portrayal of danger and rescue to the more mundane trivialities of &quot;who's out in the lead...who's bringing up the rear...who's moving ahead&quot; as if the reader had no idea of the outcome of the 1996-1997 Vendee-Globe race. (Maybe there are a great many readers who do not have any knowledge of the outcome of the event...but it's certainly not necessary to present this book in an anticipatory 'present tense' as if there was to be a surprise outcome). But do not despair as there is much to enjoy and learn in this book. One competitor takes up self-surgery to cut out infected parts of his arm and another competitor lashes himself to his inverted boat to await rescue in the cold Antarctic seas. The author's strongest presentation is when he delves into the minds of these solo around the world sailors. Why do they do this? And the very best story of all might have been missed by the author as the first woman to successfully complete the Globe-Vendee (Chabaud)slowly and steadily succeeds at the end of the pack. Her story needed to be told...at best she is followed by the author as he is obliged to keep the reader informed about all the boats in the race. I say read the book..but borrow it as it isn't a keeper in my library.	2000-11-10
