However, the tax code doesn't change that much from year to year, so the book can still be worth reviewing,  especially for its strategic financial advice and citations of rulings. I would really like to find something more recent that addresses these issues.  Original review:<br /><br />If you are in an educational field and pay taxes in the US, you owe it to yourself to buy the current version of this book.<br /><br />I have used the annual editions of this book for years (since the early 1980s). It is a much better tax guide than the general tax guides I have looked at in the past (e.g. Lasser).  Unlike other tax guides I have seen, which walk you through the tax return, this one is oriented around financial issues (e.g. home office, expenses of attending school, retirement plans, tax sheltered plans, etc.) and is consists of tax basics along with interesting strategic info about how to deal with that issue.<br /><br />For example, other tax books will tell you how to fill out the form for a Roth IRA.  This book tells you why you should have a Roth IRA, and even why you should set up one for your children, illustrating the magic of compound interest over the life of your child by a graph.  In this sense, the book bridges the gap between filling out tax forms and financial planning -- this kind of strategic advice is useful no matter now the details of the tax code change from year to year.<br /><br />It is a cogent presentaton of all the tax issues that people in educational fields and school employees will encounter, such as how to deduct professional book purchases.  It is filled with examples and little-known IRS rulings that can make a real difference in how you handle different tax situations, such as what are the rulings on valuing used items that you deduct to charity.<br /><br />They used to have a book \\"Tax Guide for Engineers\\" that was oriented aroud the financial situations of engineer types of occupations.  That was also good, and had more info about consulting, but the year I was able to compare the engineer version and the college teacher version (early 90s), there was more information overall in the college teacher version.<br /><br />I buy the current edition of this book every year (that it is available), and use it to do taxes and financial planning.<br /><br />==> Much of this book is the same from year to year, but it is important to get the most recent version so that you have current information and analysis of current tax strategies.<br /><br />Fall 2008 addition:  I recently emailed the author and asked if there were going to be any more editions of this book, and he said no. I hope someone else picks up this niche of tax advice publications.and had more info about consulting, but the year I was able to compare the engineer version and the college teacher version (early 90s), there was more information overall in the college teacher version.

Original Review:<br /><br />This is a useful great book about \\"paper clay\\".  However, the editorial description of this book doesn't quite tell you what \\"paper clay\\" is, so here is a nuts and bolts description:  Paper clay is ceramic clay (slip or dry powder+water) that has had some percentage of fiber mixed into it, which produces a product with very interesting properties.  The fibers can be paper, or refractory such as ceramic fiber.<br /><br />Because of the intermixed fibers, the unfired clay is stronger and can be manipulated when very thin, so it facilitates new kinds of clay sculpting.  Additionally, because the fiber provides a sort of scaffolding that prevents shrinkage, \\"paper clay\\" can be used in new ways that traditional clay cannot, such as adding on to or repairing already bisqued pots.  There is lots more, and it is all well discussed in this book, with some mention in the editorial description.<br /><br />The style of the book is NOT that of a craft recipe book, it is a thorough discussion of paper clay usage and variations, firing issues, fiber sources, steps in making and using, etc.  There are specific charts and tables in the appendix.<br /><br />The topic is definitely worth five stars to anyone who works in clay.  The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that I can imagine even more comprehensive coverage, especially of use of castable refractory fiber -- other than that, it is worth five stars.  But it is definitely an informative and useful book, which benefits from being the successor of several previous books on the topic by the same author.<br /><br />NOTE:  There is a commercial product called \\"Paper Clay\\" which seems to be some sort of air-dry paper mache.  The paper clay in this book is entirely different, a ceramic material which requires kiln firing.	2005-07-28

Hopefully this clarification is helpful to others:<br /><br />This book's editorial description, along with the title, seem to suggest that its focus is in how to create various homemade ad hoc kilns (for those that don't have ready access to a kiln already).  It talks about kiln building, and never uses the word raku.<br /><br />Basically, however, this is a raku book, with lots of interesting variations.  \\"Barrel\\" and \\"pit\\" kilns (mentioned in the subtitle) turn out to be just more forms of raku, rather than new kinds of homemade kilns.  It contains many creative firing ideas with wonderful results, generously shared by a number of contributors.  Along the way, of course, they do tell you how to put together firing chambers for these firing techniques.  So it does provide some alternative kiln construction guidance with variations, but not the quantity I was expecting.  And the firing techniques were an unexpected bonus.<br /><br />In style, this is a thin \\"coffee-table book\\" - lots of great photos, widely set lines of type, artistic white space.  But the content is fascinating and invaluable to anyone who wants to do firings that are more interesting than simply closing the door and turning on the heat.  Initially, I was disappointed when I saw how the content of the book was padded out with white space, but after I started reading I realized how much great information was in it.<br /><br />I would like to see much more expanded content (not counting the gallery & appendices, it is 89 pages). However, this does provide plenty of ideas to try for quite some while.  I just need to find a different alternnative kiln book for when I'm not doing raku style firings.  (The publisher could really help out here, by giving the table of contents, which really does give an accurate idea of the book content).	2005-07-22

Having a window into that world was interesting, for a while.<br /><br />However that is not enough to make a good book.  The primary disgusting aspect of this book is the constant theme of reveling in dried up body parts of supposed saints, but there are other disgusting aspects as well.<br /><br />The book starts out interesting, conveying how very different the bizarre world view of a religious christian at that time was to the world we live in today.  And there is a problem introduced that seems like it is going to be a mystery that will drive the plot.  But then after the first say 1/3 of the book, the middle of the book is succession of boring and tedius groveling and praying at various holy sites.  (This could be interesting if this is of meaning to you.)  Then at the end, aspects of the problem return, and things get really grim and disgusting.  There is no mystery and ensuing detective thought and insight, there is just straightforward progress in dealing with the problem.  Oh yes, a touch of \\"magical realism\\" that jumps in out of the blue at a critical scene at the end.<br /><br />It is too bad there is so little plot, and what little there is has such a unpleasant taste to its resolution.  The author has gone to great effort to provide a well-written and excruciatingly detailed picture into the world of 1400s pilgrimages, which I did find interesting.  But it reads more as a boring travelogue framed by a bit of plot distastefulness at the beginning and end.<br /><br />Also, in an afterward, you read that it was based on the translations of this real guy's journals.  So then I wonder how much of it was actually conceived by the author, or just put into good narrative form from what was extant in the journals.	2005-07-13

The copyright page for the book itself says that it is copyright 1973, and was reprinted 1989, 1992, and 2002, and originally published by Macmillan.  Seems like it is simply a reprint, not a 1989 revised second edition, as the publication information states. [And I did match ISBN numbers, so I am talking about the right book.]<br /><br />In its day, this book was worth 5 stars, and there is still lots of good information in it.  However, a ceramics book from 1973 is very different from one in 1989, because usage of toxics like lead will be more cavelier, and newer developments (like inclusion pigments for things like cadmium reds) won't be covered.  In the glaze chapter, lead is used in many of the recipes for lower temperature glazes (up to cone 1-2).<br /><br />Today, there are computer programs which simplify glaze calculations for putting together a particular glaze for a particular cone (kiln temperature).  However, this was not the case in 1973.  By providing a number of glaze recipes for practically each cone, the glaze chapter of this book provided a way around all those calculations.  I think this was one of the great uses of this book in 1973, and it is still worthwhile in that respect.<br /><br />Also, in case you are looking for his book with recipes for things like crystalline glazes and fire brick, insulation brick, kiln shelves, etc, this is not it (try Contemporary Ceramic Formulas).<br /><br />The publisher should really care enough to tell you what this book contains, but since they do not, here are the four chapters of this book:<br /><br />-- 1. Clay Body Formulas:  Earthenware, Medium Temp, Stoneware, Porcelain, Raku, Colorants, Stains, Engobes, Egyptian Paste (pgs 2-31)<br /><br />-- 2. Glaze Formulas:  recipes for almost every cone from 022-13, then Slip Glazes, Raku Glazes, and Glaze Colorants. (pgs 32-91)<br /><br />-- 3.  Enamel formulas (pgs 92-96)<br /><br />-- 4.  Glass Formulas (pgs. 97-101)<br /><br />Followed by pages of informative charts, etc.<br /><br />Almost every page has at least 10 recipes on it. It looks like there is lots of useful stuff in here, but much self experimentation would be needed since there are no photos (and watch out for the leaded recipes in the lower cones).  It could also use an index (e.g. on what pages can I find opalescent glazes?, or red glazes?, etc.)<br /><br />The contents of this book, taken along with his other books, are an important body of work.  Just be aware of what is missing or out of date for usage today.ulas (pgs. 97-101)    Followed by pages of informative charts, etc.    Almost every page has at least 10 recipes on it.

There are many photographs about techniques and many illustrations of beautiful artistic ceramics pieces.  Also it contains lots of technical information, tables, etc.<br /><br />Since other reviews have covered the merits of this book quite well, I'll mention a few issues:<br /><br />First, there are lots of sample photos of different clay bodies under different firings and different glaze colors and combinations, etc., but they are all *way too small* to really see the characteristics of each sample.  Also sometimes there is a series of photos, e.g. throwing a pot, building a kiln, and when they are all arranged on the page, each one is too small (and many are b&w, from previous editions?)  Otherwise the book is very well illustrated with a wide variety of work.<br /><br />The glaze discussion does not cover the properties of glaze bases and coloring oxides much at all, which is something I would expect in a book of this comprehensiveness.  It does spent some time on commercial fritted stains and Mayco glazes, which other books don't, and can be useful to some, especially for low-temp work.  But if you really want to get into glazes, this is not the book.<br /><br />For many advanced topics, she has just a mention that leaves me  hungry for more.  E.g. lusters she briefly mentions using and making, but Rhodes has a much more thorough discussion of making lusters.  Paperclay is mentioned briefly but not enough to really tell me how to make it or use it.  For many of the topics in the book, more detailed discussions are possible and likely available elsewhere.  However she has assembled lots of brief mentions of different and experimental work that you might not encounter in other ceramics survey books, so it is useful for knowing what else I want to look into.<br /><br />[This review pertains to the 4th edition, 2003.]	2005-06-10

It includes lots of photographs (generally several per page), both of work-in-progress, as well as creative completed work.

Because I don't think that Amazon has yet implemented time travel to future books for its customers, it is clear that the reviews dated 2000 and 2001 pertain to a much older edition of this book.<br /><br />This book seems a very reasonable introductory survey of things you do in ceramics, so would be a reasonable self-teaching text for someone using an electric kiln (check the table of contents to see the topics).  About half the book is technique (though not as detailed as many other books, such as Petersen or Warshaw).  Technique discussion is illustrated by many fascinating photos.  Then about half the book is simply \\"Gallery\\" with more fascinating and beautiful photos, but no text.  So the quantity of text is not huge, but what is there seems quite useful.<br /><br />In the discussion section, at various points it got quite interesting.  E.g. with glazes, it goes through things that can occur in glazes (crawling, shivering, crazing, etc.), and then tells you how to accomplish it if you want, and then how to avoid it if you don't.  To me this was one of the more fascinating because it explained how these effects came about and how to strive for them.  This particular part was only a few pages, but quite worthwhile if these kinds of things interest you.<br /><br />At time to time, as appropriate, there were discussions relevant to electric kilns, but the whole book wasn't just electric kilns.  This book is more of an artistic text book with electric kiln pointers, than a highly technical electric kiln book.	2005-06-05

Most of the ceramics techniques in this book you will already know something about if you have had a good ceramics class.  If the topics listed are new to you, then this book is a great introduction.  If you've already been exposed to them, then this book does not take you farther.<br /><br />There is not a lot of specific low-temperature information, other than a few recipes (which can be quite useful).  In particular, I was hoping for a book that would help me approach the effects of high temperature glazes when working with a low temperature kiln, how to modify a high temperature glaze recipe to be suitable for lower temperature work, how to do glaze calculations, etc.<br /><br />For an introductory book, it is very good, with good photos, etc.  I'm giving it 3 stars simply because it is only introductory.<br /><br />There are more thorough treatements of surface decoration in ceramics, like Hopper's _Making Marks_.  And there are better coverages of ceramics in general that include this surface decoration information, such as Peterson's _Craft & Art of Clay_, which is much larger, but can (at this writing) be purchased inexpensively from discounted booksellers listed through the Amazon page.	2005-05-31

The complete contents of this book comprise about half of Neal French's \\"The Potter's Encyclopedia of Color, Form and Decoration: The Comprehensive References for Today's Ceramicist\\".  (The other half is his \\"Potter's Directory of Shape and Form\\").  Thus, that book is a better buy than this one, hence the two star rating.  The content is worth four stars (see why below), but get it in the better book.<br /><br />This book contains well organized photos of glaze samples, so that you can see the effects of different combinations, firing conditions and firing temperatures.  The samples appear to be close to life size.  For me the book is valuable in seeing what a single oxide looks like in various glaze/firing conditions.  This is very useful to me for seeing the limitations of low fire kiln, and for understanding the kinds of effects I get when I do high temp firing.<br /><br />It is not a \\"how to\\" book telling you how to apply glaze or ways of decorating ceramics.  Its purpose is to give you mastery over using specific oxides for different color/texture effects.  There are some quite detailed techical books out there which also cover this, but the visual immediacy of this little book is quite valuable. It is important to understand that each firing situation is different and just because they got a particular shade or texture, it doesn't mean you will too, but it is a good guide to help you figure out what you want to try.<br /><br />Here are the nuts & bolts of the contents, to help you decide if this is the glaze sample book for you.<br /><br />For each set of samples, four base glazes are used, two cone 04 low fire glazes (alkaline, lead), and two cone 6 high fire glazes (oxidation, reduction).  Except for the reduction firings, all firings are oxidizing, as detailed in the firing section.  The top of each column of samples is labeled by base glaze and firing-type, and rows of samples are labeled individually or by row as to ingredients.<br /><br />The book covers 9 basic coloring oxides:  copper, cobalt, red iron, maganese diox, chrome, rutile, vanadium pentoxide, nickel, ilmenite.  For each oxide, there is a 6 page spread giving various test samples:<br />- 1 page of intro comments with example photos of use on pots<br />- 1 page of firings with different oxide strengths in each of the four base glazes (total of 12)<br />- 2 pages of cross-blends with the other eight oxides, for each of the four base glazes (32 samples total)<br />- 1 page (12 samples) of using the oxide in-glaze, under-glaze, & in slip, for each of the four base glazes<br />- 1 page (12 samples) of using the glaze with various opacifiers, in four base glazes.<br />The \\"How to Use this Book\\" section which is given in the amazon sample pages illustrates the first four pages of each oxide's entry.<br /><br />Then there are stain samples:  a page of four primary color stains in four glaze bases (16 samples), four pages of cross blends to mix intermediate colors (64 samples), two pages of in-glaze, underglaze, and slip coloring samples (32 samples).<br /><br />Finally there one page of using oxides in a raku base glaze with raku firing (16 samples).  This is minimal raku coverage and I would really like to see more.<br /><br />All in all this is a very useful book.  I'm giving it four stars only because I can imagine an even better and bigger book covering this kind of topic with more base glazes, more oxides, more cross-blends, etc.  For what it is, it is five stars in quality, but I would like a wider scope.<br /><br />---<br /><br />P.S. regarding other reviews:<br /><br />I can't believe the reviewer who wrote \\"Useless pretty book\\" is writing about the same book.  Every column and row/sample is clearly labeled as to glaze and firing condition.  Along with the 7 glaze recipes on pages 8-9, and detailed firing sequences on pages 12-13, it is very clear how each sample was produced.<br /><br />Again I wonder the same thing about the people who say they have the book in spanish, and they voted twice, but who can tell if it is really the same book or not since they gave no reasons.he book in spanish, and they voted twice, but who can tell if it is really the same book or not since they gave no reasons.	2005-05-30

Just randomly paging, here are some recipe titles:  Kona Coffee Wine (uses coffee berry pulp), Kona Coffee \\"Pate\\" with Pistachio, Kona Coffee Chicken Salad, Quick Date Kona Coffee Cake, Lamb Roast with Kona Coffee Gravy, Kona Coffee Pork Roulade, Kona Coffee Banana Cake, Kona Coffee Marshmallow Candy, Kona Coffee Gelatin.  You get the idea.<br /><br />Because of its unique niche and the way the recipes sounded when I saw them on tv, I'm giving it 5 stars.  It is much better than the usual club benefit recipe collection, but if using coffee as a flavor ingredient does not interest you, then for you it is probably close to 4 or 3 stars.	2004-12-17
US	49880048	R2DRS85DAFTHIW	0321287851	227031493	Learn the iPod for 5 Bucks	Books	1	10	11	N	N	minimal information (possibly good for technophobes)	This is a small book, about the size of one of the super thin CD cases.  It tells you about one cool thing to do per two page spread.  It has about 50 pages.  Do you get the idea?<br /><br />It is well suited for someone who wants to go just a tiny bit beyond what the ipod packaging itself tells you.  Many of the things it tells you are simply how to turn on or off various options.  This is a good book for someone who doesn't want to get involved in doing very much with their ipod, but just wants to know a bit more than what apple tells you.<br /><br />If you're getting an ipod as a gift for a person who is not experienced with technology, it would be a good choice.  However, if you're the type who is using amazon to find an ipod book, you would probably find this book unsatisfying.	2004-10-07

There are lots of good details in this book, which seems to go farther than the missing manual series.  The 4th edition (hot pink cover) seems to have pretty even coverage of using an ipod/itunes with Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, and Windows XP.  After a day examining ipod books in the bookstore, this is one I bought.  The 5th edition is out due in December 2004.	2004-10-07

At the time, it was invaluable.<br /><br />Now there are much better books out there, and this one now stands out by the low content bloated presentation.  You don't learn anything about principles of GIS, or strategies for information analysis.  You only learn how to copycat step by step various exercises.<br /><br />If you are a total computer novice and want hand holding, this is a successful book you will probably enjoy for awhile, until you start getting curious about doing real things with this program.	2004-09-05
US	49880048	RIJHW0462VDDL	0967920825	782564585	GIS Concepts and ArcGIS Methods	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Best book about ArcGIS, beats anything ESRI produces (as of 2004)	This book is heads and shoulders above anything else I've ever seen (so far, in 2004) about ArcGIS.<br /><br />This book (and its predecessor _GIS Concepts and ArcView Methods_) is a very successful integration of the principles and power of Geographic Information Systems, along with how to do it in ArcGIS (or ArcView in the case of its predecessor).  It gives the high level view as well as the low level steps, but well integrated so that you learn what to do and why to do it at the same time.  You also get the middle level information, like what the data structures are and how to use them, etc.  And when you want to refer to a method later, it is concisely described.  You come out knowing what GIS is, as well as knowing how to do it in ArcGIS.<br /><br />Most other books about Arc software suffer from an incredibly bloated style that hide principles inside low level instructions, e.g. click on this command, move the cursor here on the screen, etc. filling out the pages with screen shots so that there is very little content per page.  And at the end of it all, the feeling is that you've done an exercise, and can copycat the steps, but don't have the principles or the broad view of how to use the program.<br /><br />If you want to really learn ArcGIS, this is the book to get.  UPDATE:  Search for the title to find listings for the newer editions of this book (for some reason, searching for the author doesn't find them all).  At the time of this update, the most recent version is the 4th edition from 2011.  And by now there may be other great ArcGIS books out there as well [ETA 4/15/14].	2004-09-05

Most other books are very bloated books which concentrate on step by step instructions but don't give you the broad view of what a GIS is and why and how to use it.  This book successfully integrates GIS theory and motivation and strategy with how to do it in ArcView.  Information is effectively and concisely presented and you get lots of depth.  This book assumes you have no GIS information but leads you to some quite sophisticated usage (e.g. scripts and programming).  It also presents lots of nice nice items that aren't evident in the documentation, and neat tricks (e.g. how to make an ArcView project portable so that it can run on more than one computer without all the file links being broken).<br /><br />If you have never used a computer and are uncomfortable with menus, etc., you might want to get one of the more introductory books.  (But then, you are unlikely to be reading this review if that is who you are).<br /><br />If you are comfortable with computers and just want to get the details on how to do interesting things with ArcView, this is the book for you.	2004-09-05

Since then the author has produced additional polymer clay books, as well as a 2006 edition of this book.  I have not seen the newer 2006 edition, so I do not know if any of my comments below apply to the newer edition or not.]<br /><br />Donna Kato is one of the greats in the PC world.  On the Carol Duvall show you can see her and others from her company teaching all sorts of interesting techniques (in fact, this is what made me return to the world of polymer clay which I left some time ago when I started silversmithing and glassblowing).  And, her development of a new improved brand of polymer clay is just as important as her teaching.<br /><br />You know the phrase \\"standing on the shoulders of giants\\"?  Donna Kato's work and book have made significant advances in the field, so now there is a new crop of more recent books that have even more.  This book is now dated.  It was published in 1997.  The information in it is still good, but there are newer techniques not included in the book.  There are lots of great recent books out which teach polymer techniques.<br /><br />Also I agree with the reviewer who said it was \\"not very instructive\\".  There are not step by step photos and \\"recipes\\".  I was eager to see this book when I heard it so highly recommended, and was disappointed with it when I finally saw it.  Again, there are better ones for this, such as Heaser's The Polymer Clay  Design Book.<br /><br />This book was worth 5 stars when it came out, but now it is worth less because of newer competition.  It is still a good book, but consider some of the recent ones as well.<br /><br />It would be really cool if Donna Kato were to write a new book incorporating all the new stuff that is out there.	2004-03-18

But it is a history book, NOT the botanical book I was hoping for.  [Since it took me some time to track down a description of book content (which Amazon doesn't have as of this writing), I'm giving it here to help out anyone else who stumbles upon this listing.  Amazon requires a rating to post reviews, so I'm giving it a neutral 3 stars since I haven't seen the book.]<br /><br />I have been looking for a good botanical \\"flora\\" (systematic scientific listing and account of all the plant species in a defined area) for Guatemala.  Years ago there was a multi-volume (10+) set of issues produced by the Field Museum in Chicago, which are available sporadically in the used marketplace.  Also the Missouri Botanical Garden is working on a Flora of Mesoamerica, but last I looked it was not out.<br /><br />So when I saw this book, published by a natural history press, I thought this might be it!  (Being written in Spanish wasn't a issue).  But, I decided I better try to find out some more details on the internet about it.<br /><br />Turns out it is NOT the book I had hoped.  It is an account of two naturalists who traveled to Guatemala in the late 1800s, and the difficulties they encountered.  From other sites I learned that Jos&eacute; Moci&ntilde;o wrote a \\"Flora de Guatemala\\" that never ended up being published (how I would like to see that one).  (He was the first to scientifically describe the quetzal, magnificant bird which is the national symbol of Guatemala, and his name, Moci&ntilde;o is preserved in the scientific name of the species.)  It sounds like an interesting account of Guatemala in the late 1800s and I would like to read it, but it isn't what I was looking for.<br /><br />Since Amazon includes no description of the book, you can see the publisher's description of this book at the publisher's site (try going to google and searching for \\"docecalles flora guatemala\\" - as of this writing that gets me to their record for the book.)book.)	2004-03-01

I'm not all that interested in embroidery, but I enjoy visual excitement.  One day while gallery hopping, we came upon a small portion of the work depicted in this book. We were both blown away by the work!  Absolutely amazing.  I would really like some posters of this work.<br />For those interested in the embroidery details, it is done with fine silk threads, hand dyed, on various fine fabrics, some of which are so fine you can see through them.  Much of the interesting texture and effect is from what they call random stitch embroidery, in which the scenes are depicted by various colored stitches .5 cm (1/4 inch) long running in various random directions, yet they all come together to make the image.  Other parts of the images are done by carefully controlled stitch direction to give crisp images.  They pick up the light and are quite luminous, some are displayed as screens with light coming from behind.  Only the enlargements in the book give a sense of the beauty and amazing technique of the actual pieces.<br />Oh, and the book is good too.  Definitely a 5 star quality coverage of the work, with background information, as described in other reviews.  But the work itself is beyond 5 stars.  (In the gallery they were priced around the $10,000-$150,000 range, some took several years to complete.)	2003-08-16
US	49880048	RQRYL3CD4TNQQ	0812236475	463434084	A History of Glassforming	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Fascinating history & techniques, poorly written	This book is a nicely illustrated and produced book, chock full of interesting glass technique through history. There are some good technique and apparatus ideas for modern day art glass workers, and lots of interesting information for other fans of glass art.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the writing style is some of the worst I've ever seen in print. It is grammatical, but at times it is so unfocused as to be almost incoherent. However, as a part-time glass artist, I find that the scope of glass history and technology revealed in just the illustrations and their captions is so full of unique useful and interesting information about working with glass that this book is well worth perusing. It is worth 5 stars for content, but I'm giving it 4 because of the awful writing.	2003-06-25
US	49880048	R3K2QPUZ9D0A8I	0072382694	970968651	Introduction to Geographic Information Systems with ArcView GIS Exercises CD-ROM	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Decent mix of GIS theory and arcview specifics	I just finished using this book for a second-level ArcView class.  At first I didn't like it that much, mostly because the writing is very soporific, but also because it blurs coverage of GIS topics and ArcView specifics together, without a clear sense of what kind of information was being presented.  (E.g. tutorial GIS material appears in the middle of exercises.  This should be separated and stand off in a separate font, for instance, than the low level instructions of what ArcView commands to perform for the exercise.)<br />However, as I read this book more, I got to like it and appreciate it much more.  It occupies a unique niche in the GIS literature field, because *NO OTHER BOOK* that I have been able to track down (with one exception given below) combines high level GIS concepts with their realization in ArcView (if there are others I'd like to know).<br />Most other books are either GIS theory alone, or very *very* low level bloated books about ArcView as a program (e.g. practically everything esri publishes), with little or no connection to, or explication of, high level GIS concepts, theory, and data structures. (Also as I read on, the writing became less soporific: I don't know if this was because I got used to the author's writing style, or if the writing actually improved.)<br />In contrast to all those other ArcView books, this book presents some GIS theory, and then shows how to actually do something with these concepts in ArcView.  The exercises on the CD provide data and shapefiles specific to what is being taught, so that the reader learns how to actually do quite powerful things in ArcView. It became quite exciting to see some of the cool things that could be done as the chapters went on.  (For learning and using ArcView, this book goes along well with Theobald's excellent reference on ArcView, which also bridges the gap between GIS theory and ArcView by presenting almost every nut and bolt relevant to ArcView usage, organized by high level GIS concepts.)<br />Regarding the complaints in the other review:  I encountered just a couple of bugs in the supplied CD exercises, and most of them could by remedied in one way or another.  (The newer printing of the book may or may not have these bugs fixed.)  Although a trial version of ArcView is included on the CD for installing on your home computer (I used a Mac with Virtual PC), the text includes exercises using the ArcInfo program when there was something that couldn't be done in ArcView.  On the book's cover, they clearly mention that only ArcView is included on the CD.  For the exercises which required special extensions such as 3D Analyst, we used the college's computers which had those extensions installed, so that was not a problem.  It is unfortunate that not every tool covered in the book could have a trial verision included in the CD (not the fault of the publisher, but of esri), but I'd rather have the knowledge coverage in the book so I can learn about it even if the program is not on the CD.<br />I think this book deserves five stars for content, but I'm giving it four because of the stylistic problems described above.concepts.)<br />Regarding the complaints in the other review:  I encountered just a couple of bugs in the supplied CD exercises, and most of them could by remedied in one way or another.
