I really did not like \\"A Place of Hiding.\\" I will not recap the story as it has been done enough already.  The following is a spoiler alert to those who have not yet read the book:  the ending was unacceptable.  How many books did us as readers have to wade through regarding the relationship between Thomas and Helen?  They were not yet married a year and what the point was, well, it is beyond me.  Sort of like the jump the shark epidsode in Happy Days. Desperation on the part of George?  I think, though, that this is the end of line for Havers and Thomas.  After all, the story ends with Barbara not only getting her rank back but also in the arms, while in a comforting manner, with her neighbor, who we all know she likes.  Thomas will head back to the family pile.  He formally left the Yard and prepared Barbara to work without him.  So poor rich handsome Thomas ends up alone and Barbara, poor and homely, ends up better off than him.  Which is what I am guessing George's point was - see, money and looks can not bring you happiness.  But there were other faults in this rather long story.  There is no way that in the middle of a serial murder investigation anyone, no matter how inept, would bring in the press to do what Hiller did.  Makes no sense!! And Hiller's extreme dislike towards Thomas was almost psycho.  He did everthing to get under his skin but as to Thomas's reasons for staying on, I can not figure.  When Thomas gets a call from the killer who mentions his pretty wife and what does he do?  Ah, he tells silly self-centered Deborah to make sure Helen is not alone cause, well, someone with the flu might be around...I mean, how intelligent is this?  No way that would not have been taken serious with Helen receiving 24/7 protection. Then Thomas makes a connection (we think) betwen Hil and Stewart  but the story goes no where with possible information. The books ends with the12 year old being charged with Helen's death but we know it was through the work fo Fu so...Helen is also a victim of his, yes??  But everyone keeps mentioning they are not related but we know they are.  On the note of Barbara, enough with the silly T-shirts and red high tops (so 80's anyway).  Okay we get the point she is unattractive, poorly dressed, not exactly in shape.  Her hair is cut badly, her teeth need fixing.  Why make her endlessly unappealing physically?  It is not as if I expected Helen to do a make-over with Barbara, but a better hair cut, fix your teeth and get an iron would not have been out of line.  She is a walking disaster but while that was once upon a time had charm now, well, everyone eventually takes stock of him or herself and tries to better themselves.  AS I said, I think this is the end of the line for this author and this great duo.  Where can they go with Tommy not working for the yard?	2005-03-25

But I have to agree that the masquerade went on too long.  After all, just about everyone figured it out after chapter 4 so the story line bcome boring.  Also, I wish the author had been more descriptive of what they both looked like.  Early on I was clueless as to what they looked like.  An epilogue would not have been out of place for this story.  Did Sinclairs Mom get married or Mel?  How did Sin and Quincy do a few years down the road?  Did she continue her unreal ability to pick stocks and make them as rich as the Fricks? <br />	2005-03-13

I am very surprised that anyone would rate this story above a 2 but I guess to each his or her own.  The plot has already been discussed. One of my problems was that everyone, with the exception of Jared, was just not likeable.  Emily. IU mean please, a spy of sorts and her Aunt, too?  Just not credible.  And Emily's brother, the duke, just a real jerk along with the rest of the brothers  and his romance with Jane was like what romance?  Since when is yelling and frowing and disliking someone a romance!  Jared's reason for keeping his little girl a secret was realistic and if Emily or the Aunt was smartly involved in spying, etc, well, she should have understood.  And what was with Lord B. who wanted to marry her when he was in love with the mother?  Just plain old silly and clearly stretched any resemblence of rational behavior.	2004-06-24

I would run out and buy them as soon as they were released.  With the start of her Nightingale series (which I hated), and continuing on, I have been consistently disappointed.  Her stories now seem to be a mish-mash of characters, most of whom fall in love immediately but then  little time is spent on their romantic development.  Her romances are too sweet valley high.  No, I am not looking for erotic stories, but the cloying \\"sweetness\\" of all her characters, males and females, the ever present animals, crazy relatives, nutty servants, have been overplayed for me.  I guess it is time for me to move on...	2002-07-16

I always enjoy when a new regency writer comes along to hopefully breath some new life into a arena grown cold and boring.  This story had the potential to be much better.  Our hero, and he is, is the Duke of Stanthorpe, Gideon. He promised his dying friend, Hawksworth, that he would marry his \\"sister\\" as she was now without protection and would be forced to live on the streets.  Fulfilling his friend's dying wish became a call to honor for Gideon.  He goes home and finds the \\"sister\\", Sabrina, living in his townhome and about 2 weeks from delivery of a baby.  They meet, mis-meet, and marry.  She married for security and money.  The story starts with her lies, and the lying contines for the entire story. Trust has to be earned, yes, but the never ending lies by Sabrina are too much. Why in the world would he trust her? Gideon was led to believe that she was Hawk's sister.  He finds her to be with child, finds out she is not Hawks sister and she tells him she will not consumate the marriage and he still marries her?  Oh, yes, you see - he is so taken by lust when he meets her he does not care...  The author goes overboard on depiciting lust for her from him...  And why in the world whould he marry her?  He is a Duke for goodness sake.  He would need an heir.  His smirks that he would overcome her dislike of the marriage act and is a bit childish in his belief.  He does not know her to really think that. Would any Duke really risk marrying an unknown, pregnant, lying woman who has no intention of giving him an heir?  Also, why would she, already a Mom 2 times over, not be willing to sleep with him for the comfort of money/shelter that he would provide?  While she had ample reasons to not like it, in order to protect her children from the possible future threat of an annulment of her marriage due to not consumating the marriage, seems crazy.  She says she would do anything for her children yet would not secure her place as his legal wife in every sense of the world goes too far.  I see that the author has a series in mind and I am guessing that Hawk is the hero in her next story due in October.  I am already disappointed.  She has made him hideous in his battle injuries.  His once beautiful face is no longer.  Why such extremes for a good man?  I think I might have to skip that one.	2002-07-16

It also shows how trash can so easily get published.  This was perhaps the worst book I ever read.  So many reasons...but I will stick with a few.  First of all, does the writer do any research?  Does she not have an editor?  My jaw dropped open when I read on page 37, \\"We're told he is selling slaves for an enormous profit in the American Colonies...he's trafficking in black flesh, selling men, women and children...\\"  Ah, this story take place in Dublin, Summer, 1870!!!!!  Hello - the American Civil War ended on April 9, 1865 at the Appomattox Court House in Virginia.  The US was NOT purchasing slaves in 1870.  My goodness - how could that have gotten by anyone?  So there goes the premise of the evil Colin Rafferty. He could not possibly be selling slaves to the \\"American Colonies\\".  Disgraceful.  Also, the story's heroine, Millicent, is 20.  Our hero, is 45.  But the author goes to great pains to point out how in shape Alec still is.  He moves like a much younger man.  Well, just make him younger.  Or her older.  She is described as a flighty 20 year old.  What reason could any women reading this story find of interest with a 45 year old man and and a 20 year old?  Do women really enjoy this poorly written trash?	2002-05-15

This book is certainly no where near as interesting or funny as \\"Miss Lockharte's Letters\\", \\"An Angel for the Earl\\", or my favorite, \\"Lord Heartless\\".  Dilly and Ty are just not terribly interesting.  Ty - our hero - had his life saved on the battlefield by Baron George, and to repay this gift, Ty rides to the rescue (or so he thinks) on George's evil horse, to rescue Dilly (the sister) from a life as an outcast.  Ty thinks Dilly is pregnant and unwed.  It is actually George's girl, Belinda, that he left behind, unwed, who is with Child.  The story was just bad.  Dilly says no to a marriage with Ty, her Uncle or Cousin tries to force her to marry someone not to her taste, Ty married Belinda on her death bed.  Strange relatives, on both sides, trying to keep them apart. It would have made more sense for Dilly to agree to marry Ty - after all, isn't that what regency misses did?  Marry for love, maybe, but more important, marry for security.  And she and her brood desperately needed that.  To turn Ty down was unrealistic.  When married, they could raise Belinda and George's child, and then the story could have concentrated around this sort of strange marriage, especially dealing with his father, the Earl, who was not pleased by the prosepct.  So the story was not funny, just off center and vastly unrealistic for a regency time period.  Actually, make it a far more interesting story and yes, have had Dilly left with child by someone. Why do regency authors always feel their female hero's must be so virginal?	2002-05-13

I loved that fact that a regency miss actually looked forward to her wedding night and admitted lust for her husband.  She actually seduces him!  Jessica Trent was not only pretty but smart and determined to make her marriage to Lord Dain work. The author does a great job of letting the reader find out why Lord Dain goes out of his way to live on the outskirts of society.  The \\"villians\\" were not terribly interesting nor noteworthy or important to the story.  That was a nice change of pace, too.  The story really focued on Dain and Jess meeting, marrying, and developing their marriage.  What I did not like - and this is a complaint of many regency books - is there is no epilogue.  This story needed one.  The story ends with Dain and Jess taking in Dain's bastard son to live with them (the boy as ugly as Dain was when he was a child) and with Jess also being pregnant.  It is an unusual thing to take in one's bastard, though not unheard of.  So how did it all play?  Was the new baby with Jess as ugly as Dain was (and Dominic)?  Did they enter mainstream London society?  Was Dominic excepted and happier than Dain as a child?  I don't know about most readers, but I do like when a story is totally finished.	2002-05-08

It is all well that she wanted to be his friend, wanted sex, he was gorgeous, but to be constantly made aware of his poor behavior (kissing his mistress in front of her) well, get a grip girl.  He deserved to be spanked for such boorish behavior.  This was not romantic, just a story of a world weary man taking advantage of a young girl.  If only Ms. RAnney had given Tessa some backbone, like her mother.  Also, the Jered showed such disrespect for his in-laws too that there was really nothing to like about him.	2002-02-22

It seems those readers who liked this story liked the fact that Jane was an unattractive female and they liked that change from the usual pretty regency miss. Well, sure, okay, she is unattractive but she is even more unattractive on the inside and that is what makes the story so bad.  Bad attitude, behavior and general unpleasantness do not, I repeat, do not make for an entertaining story or a great romance.	2002-02-11

The plot has already be described more than once so I won't do it again.  I am only giving this story 1 star as I too had a hard time with Lili's age (17) and Viscount Halpern, years older than her.  She was not out and could not figure out why Alastair and Cornelia rushed her ton presentation.  Not only was &quot;little girl&quot; Lili 17, she was even younger in her actions and understanding of the world so for a man of the world like Halpern to be interested in this child, was sort of unrealistic.  I don't know why the author felt the need to do a 17 years old romance, why not wait for a year or two when she was indeed out?  Also, I have to agree with a previous author - I also wondered about Alastair and Cornelia's lack of children.  Yes, yes, yes, maybe they could not have children, many can't, but how fun to see the idol Alastair with a child of his own!  If they could not have them, fine, make some mention of trying but no success.  So the bottom line is how interesting is a romance with a 17 year old who acts like a 15 year old!	2002-02-11

I don't know why so many regency authors write the M of C plot with no sex!  I applaud the author in recognizing that hello - nobles who marry are not necessarily looking for great love, just an heir which means....sex!  Brides of the regency era, or any era, know that the marital relations is expected.  The author handles it nicely.  Tallie' is scared, not very informed about what to expect and her mean cousin, Letitia, gives her pointedly bad advice.  I liked Tallie's discovery about sex, how to be a wife, joy of motherhood.  I liked that Magnus, the Earl, appreciated her great qualities. I was not offended by the sex between the two as that is an honest part of a relationship.  This by no stretch was a Susan Johnson erotic novel.  I found, however, Tallie's daydreaming silly after a while.  The first one - when she shook herself to stop daydreaming as for her there would be no knight - was okay, but it went on to long. Also, the Earl was so cold!  His transition from cold noble to warm one was okay, but maybe he should not have been quite so cold to begin with.  Also, he leaves Tallie pregnant at his home and with one a brief note to say good-bye and goes off for months. Gee - think she will be made, unsure, upset?  To think she would not was a stretch.  Sure, it was for her that he left to find Richard and that was nice, but at least say good-bye in person!  I look forward to more from this author!	2002-02-07

I give the story 2 stars (really 1 1/2) for a few reasons.  First, I generally enjoy Ms. Lansdowne's books.  I find her writing charming.  I am not a huge fan of historicals that have tons of sex in it.  However, sex in a regency still can be done tastefully and alluded to.  That was not necessary in this story as no one was married.  But to say, as one reviewer put it, to say there was any hot sexual tension in this story is going way to far.  Both the Marquis of Daxonbury (Dax) and Miss Desdemona Quiggley really are rather immature and seem quite young. There are no real sexually charged moments with them.  It is obvious they like aech other, but they reminded me of high school dating romances.  The more interesting romance was Lady Miranda, Dax's \\"elderly\\" aunt, and Dandy Dan.  I have an issue with Miranda's age - how old was she? Obviously not 20 but 35?  40?  45?  I do not mind an older woman and romance, but at least let us know it.  And why exactly is Desdemona Quiggley living in Lavender Hill?  That is never really explained.  I am sure a sequel is coming about Dan.  Obviously, he is of the Nobility and will end up being restored to whatever place he lost.  And Lady Miranda, a Duke's daughter and sister, lives on her own and no one comes to vist - like ever?  Weird.  I also did not Desdemona's name as it is too cartoonish.	2002-01-22

It is so silly.  And, frankly, boring.  I don't read regencies for sex ala Susan Johnson's erotic stories, but it is silly to pretend that sex is not a component of marriage.  Too victorian for me.  At least allude to it.  Out of the two romances in the book, the romance between John and Melanie is better.  Peter and Win never really mature or jell as a couple.  Peter, for all his looks (again, that other tried and true regency ploy - a too good-looking hero who can only redeem himself by loving a homely girl) is really dumb.  He think the only thing he can do to earn a living is gambling?  Many second sons went into the military or gov't work.  He even has his own estate he could have worked with.

Seems a doll of a man but to describe his nose as twice broken, with two twists on the way to the end is silly.  Even back then a nose could be set, while it might not end up perfect.  And having a nose as described by Ms. Lansdowne would have him look comical, malformed.  If she wanted to create imperfections for his appearance, why make him so perfect looking to begin with?  Having his age be 45 is okay but what was the point of making him so old?  His eldest child(ren) was 18. Logically, he could have married at 22 or 24ish and he would only be in his late 30's early 40's.  It would have been more logical to have him be in his late 30's because Judith made Olivia 31.  45 to 31 is almost 15 years between them.  Or make Olivia older. That works, too. Why make her so young anyway?  If it was to leave open the possibility of more twins, fine.  But then the story needed an epiloge to complete the story with more children.  An epiloge would have also completed the story with the Duke's re-entry into society and government on a non-spy basis.  He was so completely bared from society you have to wonder how he was welcomed him back.  He and the Earl were enemies.  Did they just show up together at a ball and all was well?  Ms. Lansdowne does have a tendency to not finish her books all the way and they are not short to begin with.  I think she needs a better editor.	2002-01-22

Where is originality?  Where is romance?  &quot;A Devilish Husband&quot; is yet another marry-for-revenge to get back at your Dad story, and is perhaps the most unromantic regency I have ever read. <br />In order to get back at his Dad for stealing the woman he was going to marry, Jared Moreland has been living a life of debauchery to embarrase his Dad.  What?  Let us see - ruin YOUR life to humiliate your Dad? To further test the limits of  readers patience, Jared, still hurt two years after his Dad marries his intended, and after his Dad tells him to marry, plans to marry below his station, just to annoy his Dad and refuse to give him the heir the father wants.  His friends, while they were drunk, pen a note to the father of Beatrice Crawford, a man who is a gambler and of little social standing, to ask for her hand in marriage. However, Beatrice was already married so Crawford substitutes his stepdaughter, prim and quite Cassy, in her place. Even after Jared finds out what his friends did, he does not care.  He will marry her anyway as it does not matter who he marries, just as long as she is someone his Dad will not approve of.  Of course, Jaren does not tell Cassy that theirs will be a marriage in name only.  Cassy, while figuring out she is his second choice to Beatrice, still wants a family and to try to make the best of her marriage.<br />I have rarely read a regency with such a lout as Jared in which the author expects us to root for him. Not only does he inform Cassy after their marriage that there will be no children (she will forever be a virgin?), he leaves her to her own devices once they are in London. She knows no one in London except her maid.  No one.  What a creep.  He tells her they are to go their own way in all matters.  Eventually, Drew, Jared's friends, comes to meet her and takes her under his wing to bring her around and introduce her to society.  When Beatrice is widowedand moves in with the couple in London, Jared uses her for a scandalous flirtation again, to annoy his Dad. Jared lets everyone think he and Beatrice are having an affair right under the same roof as his wife, Cassandra.  Cassy is a martyr to  Jared's self-destructive, endlessly bad, stupid behavior.  As the previous reviewer noted, who in their right mind decides to marry disastrously in order to get back at someone else? Why in the world would Jared's father, marrying the woman that Jared was in love with, think it would be okay?  That his son would not be hurt?  Angry?  I would think it would be devasting to bring home the woman you love to your ancestral estate to meet your family before marrying and then to have a &quot;loving father&quot; marry her instead would be horrifying.  I quote here, &quot;It was my understanding you were heard to brag at your wedding that you would soon have a whole line of heirs instead of just one churlish one.&quot;  Jared's eyes were filled with undisguised contempt as he met his father's gaze.  Lord Waycross cleared his throat, then replied gruffly, &quot;Evidently I spoke too soon.  It's been two years, and Eleanor is not yet increasingly. So the continuation of our family is up to you.&quot;  No wonder, in a way, Jared revolts.  So even understanding Jared's motives, and valid ones at that, he had no right to marry Cassy and not tell her before what sort of marriage it was to be. While I give her credit for carving out her own life, the situation was pathetic.  No chemistry between them.  There were no even remotely entertaining scenes between them.  Not a single moment between them were the reader could say, ah, the relationship has some hope.  When he realizes he loves her, as a reader you wonder, why?  He does not know her and she thinks she has feelings for him?  Why?  Anyone who would harber feeling of love for him after the way he treated her has to have their head examined.  0 romance for this story.	2002-01-10

A third generation Baron, he was injured as a child by a horse.  He limps and his face is scared on one side.  He is excepted in society so I am guessing not hideously scared.  But scared enough that all take note of it and he has declared himself a bachelor for life.  Lucy, our heroine, is the goddaughter of Queen Charlotte and is in the Queen's black book for breaking her 2 year engagement to Mr. Holden.  Events lead to Victor and Lucy marrying, each one not terribly pleased.  As in almost all regencies, sex not an issue as the author solves that problem by the tried and true regency romance method, Victor tells Lucy they can wait for that aspect of their marriage until she invites him.  Please...how uninteresting.  FYI to regency writers - sex can be alluded to in your stories, especially when the stories include marriage as it is a natural part of marriage. Writers do not have to go into detail, but stop being so afraid of it!  It is almost unnatural they way it is avoided.  Poor Victor also has a phobia of horses, so does not ride and had real trouble with &quot;mania&quot; in a carriage.  The trouble with the story was it was not interesting.  There was nothing really new in this regency.  Again, the beautiful chaste bride, the maimed groom.  Half way through the story, Lucy feels she is now in love with Victor but as the reader you have to ask why?  And if so, why not finally sleep with him?  Lucy herself admits that interaction betwen them is strained so where does this love come from?  On his side, he notes she seems sweeter than he thought.  Well, okay but love?  There is zero chemistry between them, too.	2001-12-18

Our heroine, Gillian, marries Viscount Prescott, an Irish landowner, a widower with 3 young children.  Gilly had set out to ruin herself in London to bypass her Mother's plans for a great marriage.  While she was indeed &quot;ruined&quot;, after recieving a note from Prescott asking her to marry him, sight unseen, she decides to marry him as she senses his loneliness from the letter. Prescott wants to marry again for the sake of his children.  Poor Gilly seems to spend her time trying to live up to the memory of the near perfect first wife, Elizabeth.  The story focus's in on Gilly's attempts to be good mother to the children (who are not pleased by her presence, except for the youngest, handicapped daughter), and a mate to her husband. Unfortunately Avery (Viscount Prescott)is still in love with his wife and has no intention of consummating the marriage; he thinks Gilly is ruined thereby he is not denying her the chance at the physical side of romance.  But she is innocent and does eventually admit that to her husband.  He does feel guilty, then, about the sort of odd marriage.  But why such an unnatural marriage?  A bit too extreme.<br />What I liked about the story was it was different.  Back in that time of history, it was pretty normal for women to marry men not only to give birth to the prescribed heir but also, since women died in childbirth, to become mothers to the widowers children.  Regency romances shy away from that. It was not all shy maidens and great matches back then. I was also pleased that Gilly and her husband do sleep together. That was interesting, their relationship before and after.  Did he still mourn his first wife after Gilly and he slept together?  As in the traditional regency romance, sex is not described at all thereby still being &quot;sweet&quot;.  Perhaps a detail or two would not have been awful, but you get the sense thatGilly is a normal, desiring woman and her husband realizes this. But he is pretty cool to her and so is Jane, the oldest daughter.  In one scene, Gilly is so depressed and lonely she writes to her Mother asking to come home (a letter she throws out).  Later, that same day after a fight, Prescott comes to her room and finds the letter he wrote Gilly asking to marry him.  It would be have made more sense for him to find the letter Gilly wrote to her Mom.  Gilly was so sad.  She loved Prescott, and says this horrible cliche, that she loves him and is unhappy but would also be unhappy not to see him so might as well be unhappy with him.  Seems so pathetic and out of character for a woman like Gilly who was a rather proactive person. At least Avery would read how sad she was and mabye get off his behind and stop being a jerk.  Avery tells Gilly he does not want anymore children.  Well, he does sleep with her.  She never gets pregnant so he, what, pulls out or something?  Did he really not want more children ever and that is fine with Gilly?  The story begins with the marraige and ends exactly one year later.  And no baby.  It would have been nice for the story to end with a possible baby. The baby issue bothered me as well as Gilly sitting around and being so unhappy. And her husband was Irish.  Did he have an accent?  You would never know it.	2001-12-17

Sure, sometimes it gets old reading regencies about perfect looking people but I think readers are wrong to equate surly and nasty with being interesting because the lady is not beautiful.  In fact, for me, Jane's very unattractiveness was compounded by her really bad behavior.  There was no way anyone would be attracted to Jane as she is so unkind and nasty.

I really do not like these sort of regency books, the gorgeous rake and the plain, shy almost spinster.  Ms. Donelly write the romance of staggeringly handsome Geoffrey, Lord Staines, a future Earl, and plain, shy but oh so sweet Eleanor Glover.  She is one of 4 sisters and of course, they are all most attractive than she is.  Lord Stains had his heart broken by a blond beauty.  His father wants him to marry before he dies (claims he is dying) and must marry at Christmas.  Geoff agrees and decided upon sensible, plain Eleanor.  He figures she won't demand love. A sensible woman for a sensible, arranged marriage.  Only Eleanor falls in love with him.  Ah, why? And why would he fall in love with her?  Does anyone else notice how many regencies are about homely, nice women who end up with the gorgeous hunk?  Again, this is the same tried and somewhat boring story.  Eleanor can barely look into his face and hold a conversation and he falls in love with her?  Suddenly she becomes beautiful?  Yes, he does come upon her telling children a story and she shines.  Please....Geoff was in love with another woman.  I don't have a hard time beleiving he would fall in love with Eleanor because the story gave no indication them getting the chance to get to know each other.  There is no witty dialogue between them, no sparing, not shared interests.  His brothers are trying to keep them apart, to spend as little time before the marriage as possible. The story just does not work for me. Also, why is it in regency romances that the plain spinsters recognize lust and acknowledge it while the beauties don't even know the parts of a man or how children are conceived?  Boring story.	2001-12-14

I liked Sabrina Bennett.  I liked Hunter, our hero the Earl of Greystone.  But what I did not like was the constant references to Sabrina'a age, 18.  Yes, Hunter was in his early 30's, I think 32 or 34.  Yes, he was older.  But she came across as a teenager.  He referred to her throughout the book as a child, as &quot;little one&quot;.  Rather off putting, especially in bedroom play.  Not that there was lots of that.  Why did Ms. Brown employ her age to such distraction?  Why make the age issue such an issue?  It really took away from the story for me.  Even in the bedroom scenes, she was wearing modest, high neck, white cotten nightgowns.  Because she was really a girl, not a woman and thus, should have been left in the nursery.	2001-12-10

Again, as another reader pointed out, the last 100 pages were sooooooooooo bad I was floored anyone could like this book.  Elizabeth treats James with such disdain that I too hoped he would move on.  Also, his so called friends, Caroline and James, were hardly that.  They too seemed to take great pleasure out of the absurd situation with James and Elizabeth.

Her mystery's with Lynley and Havers and Co. on the case, with an in-depth look at their lives outside of policing, are terrific.  This book was just a mess.  700 pages?  Only the bible could be that long and get away with it.  Too many story lines, i.e. lesbian lover, cyber sex, past family relations, changed names, adultery, and it really all goes no where.  Gideon and his doctor's sessions were about 1/2 of the book and was totally unnecessary.  I found myself skimming and if it was not for the hope that it would get better, I would have put it down and forgotten it.  I hope that Ms. George's next story comes out before 2 years and includes the cast we love.  I do  wonder, however, if Winston and that gal get together.	2001-08-17

Lynley's feelings of guilty re. St. James are getting a little dated at this point.  The story of Gidon was, well, boring. It went on way too long.  Libby, Gideon's sort of weird American girlfriend and the ending were overdown.  It was just not interesting. It was easily figured out early on.  And EG seemed to incorporate story lines that went no where.  What was the point?  I wanted to put this one down several times, but did not due to the fact I kept hoping it would get interesting.  It does not.  I had no issue with Winston getting more play, but the core of her stories - Barbara and Lynley - are what keep readers coming back for more.

She is only 17 and everyone, from the Viscount, in-laws and family count her as being too young to even take in the season.  She was also raised in a convent then on a farm so she would thereby be more sheltered than even the other 17 year old young girls.  She was a very young 17.  It might have made more sense for Ms. Hazard to yes, take Lili from the Moorland farm and live with Cornelia and Alastair but still wait until she was of age to do the Season.  Romance between the the 28 year old Viscount and the 17 year old convent breed young girl did not fly with this reader, even given the time period.	2001-08-07

Lili, the charming little girl from \\"The Wary Widow\\" is now 17 and still lives on the Moorland farm.  Nancy Moorland, seeing how attached her brother-in-law Ben is to Lili and realizing that it was an unsuitable match, contacts Cornelia to come and get her.  Cornelia Russell, married to the Beau Alastair, brings her to live with Alastair and her and her bothersome mother-in-law.  The mother-in-law, who still harbors anger at Cornelia for not having a child by her son Ogden, thinks that Lili and Nelia are mother and daughter with Lili being a bastard.  While this is not true, this is the \\"mystery\\" of sorts in the story.  Nelia and Alatair decide that even though Lili is only 17, thereby too young for her comeout, they take her to London anyway to do so figuring she would have an early season or two under her belt.  Yes, she is too young.  That is one of the main problems in this story.  She is constantly discussed as being just a little girl.  In fact, her potential father-in-law calls her a pretty little girl.  That is sort of creepy.  Her potential hustand, the Viscount, is 28 and he too feels she is still a little girl, but certainly a well-formed one.  I realize that, back then, marrying at 17, while young, was not unheard of.  However, today if the Viscount told a 17 year old that he could not wait to make her his in bed, he could be arrested.  Ms. Hazard took great pains to make her age a factor in the story.  I think it backfires.  There is something about him trying to seduce her and not being able to keep his hands off this young girl that I did not like.  Also, what ever happened to Nelia?  She is such a drip in this story.  Alastair still seems fun and all, but she is not.  And what about children?  She is only 30 in the story, obviously they sleep together, one would wonder what was up?  Maybe she can't have them, whatever, but it as odd that it was never mentioned.  And Ben Moorland, the handsome jilted farmer, deserved some follow-up.  Perhaps a story about him and another blue blood attraction?  I only hope that if there is a Ben story, he at least dates a young woman, not a little girl.	2001-08-03

It says it is a romance but I have rarely read such an unromantic book with so little chemistry between our hero and heroine.  The story takes place in North Carolina at the beginning of the Civil War in  sort of farming community that has lots of Germans.  Our heroine, Caroline, finds out in the beginning of the story she is to marry her former brother-in-law, a dour German, Frederich.  Her sister died in childbirth with her third child, who also died, leaving behind two girls.  She refuses to marry Frederich and is beaten really badly by her brother, Avery, because of her refusal.  She is rescued and ends up married in name only to Frederich.  There is not a single moment of sexual heat, chemistry, love, interst in this story.  They sleep together one time (when he is on leave from the war) and it is a hurried affair and as a reader, you are left thinking why bother?  Romance this is not...	2001-07-12

The fact that so many find it &quot;erotic&quot; that a man would insert silver balls, use dildos rectally on a (age range in this story) 13-15 year old girl is sort of creepy.  This is Ms. Small's idea of romance?  Regan, a young Scottish lass, is sent to a convent at 13.  Instead, she is sold as a slave to be tutored as a love slave for a Moor.  Regan's twin sister, Gruoch, is to be married to a family enemy but is pregnant at the time of her wedding. Regan takes her place in the marriage bed so all would assume Gruoch was a virgin like Regan.  When the wedding Regan is sent to this convent.  Anyway, the story would have worked far better had Regan actually stayed at the convent for a few years than be sold.  Again, the age of Regan is really crude.	2001-06-25

Oh, let us not forget our hero, the rake.  Yet in this story, I have yet to figure out why Thomas Effington is referred to as a rake.  He acually seems quite a decent fellow.  The romance is not a factor as there really isn't any.  In our story, Thomas asks our heroine, Marianne, to marry him and as in too many regencies, she says no because he did not mention that he loves her.  Hello Marianne...he climbed up a vine to your bedroom window with flowers!!  For someone who prided herself on being smart, outspoken, ask about his feelings!  The story's attempt at romance is just writing about too many contrived scenes of misunderstandings which  I guess is supposed to equal romance.  I can't believe the Thomas lowered himself to climb to her bedroom window and she refuses?  Come on, Ms. Alexander.  What woman would not say yes?  Just a trite story.

Kate leaves her husband and head to Lost Peak, Montana to a home and coffee shop her grandmother who she does not know leaves to her when she dies.  Kate falls for the vastly sexy Chance McLean.  One of the very few funny lines in the book is Kate's realization that most men in Montana seemed to be named Chance, Cody, etc.  However, the story is boring and too long.

However, I disagree that this was a good romance.  I did not like this story at all. The story does have lively dialogue.  I actually like our gawky, tall millowner, Rachel Barton.  The problem is....Rachel is a &quot;bean pole&quot;, vastly unattractive, dowdy when it comes to dressing, just utterly unattractive.  Our hero, St. Armand, is gorgeous, probably the most gorgeous man Rachel has ever see, plus a practiced flirt and rake. Well, why not - he is a hunk of a man.  That is the problem. I felt sorry for Rachel.  The author goes to such pains to physically describe her poor looks that, yes, it is silly to think St. Armand would fall so quickly in love with her.  Yes, she is smart.  But not that smart.  In the beginning, she did not believe anything he told her and she was silly in her continued belief, after much obvious proof to the contrary, that the Earl was a good guy.  Hello Rachel...And any female who fell in love with such a handsome man would take some time to improve ones appearance.  The French hat maker gave her some pointers.  She did not take them up.  I realize many romance writers are writing romance tales for readers who probably look like Rachel too.  But be real.  St. Armand might have, in time, come to appreciate her intelligence and generous heart.  After time.  But he would not fall in love at first sight.  It would have been more realistic to have her burn those stupid brown dresses.  Rachel deserved better than to be described by all of London as a dowd. She would have been very uncomfortable with Yves on her arm with him so superior in looks. She did not have to be a beauty, but style would have helped.  And the author gives her none of that either.	2001-05-24

Unfortunately, she does not want to marry him so he ends up marrying her younger sister, Charity.

Why would a worldly handsome Prince fall for a child?  And if he did, he would be arrested today.  What sex appeal would he find in her?  The writing was way below par for Ms. Wolf.  I, like another reviewer, realize that many girls were married at a younger age than we find acceptable today. However, people from that time did not bath, wash their hair much, had bad teeth and skin (imaine how infrequently they brushed their teeth - and no listerine) and, gee, they must have smelled pretty bad.  Those elements are never included in these regency stories either.  So, to all Regnecy writers - I accept younger bride stories, but leave teens alone and I won't comment on the reality of living back then really being deleted from your stories.	2001-05-09

We meet Mair, a pretty ale gal who lusts after the youngerst son of the Baron, Trystan, the first page. They meet, spare and go at it against the wall. In the beginning of the story.  She is no maiden but rather is pleased to acknowledge her sexual desires and good for her. She even has an illigitmate son by Trystan's older cousin, Dylan.  I liked Mair, she was bold, sassy and very much in love with Trystan since they were children. He is my problem.  He is the younger son and comes upon a scheme that will enable him - he feels - to step out of his brothers/cousins/fathers shadow, to marry a well-born Norman beauty, who is about as warm as an ice cube.  He is petulant, stubborn and not terribly smart.  He even tells Mair that if he got her with child, he will not acknowledge the babe for fear it will ruin his chances of marrying the Norman gal.  Huh?  This is the man she loves?  He goes ahead and gets engaged to the icy Norman and we have an entire book to sift through before he realizes hey, I love Miar, not ice queen.  It just took too long to end and Trystan was not bold enough or man enough to make credible decisions. But, again, I really do applaud Ms. Moore for thankfully shelving the missish virgin for a change.	2001-04-06

She has written some great stuff in the past but not this.  Alexandra Wilton is a dolt.  Her cousin, Geoffrey, who thought he would inherit the estate and title from her father, the Earl, is in love with her.  But...it turns out that a highlander named Niall is to inherit and marry the beautiful Alexandra.  He is a dishy man but once again, Joan  Wolf goes for the bride who refuses to sleep or consumate her marriage.  Why would a female refuse to or at least at some point consider sleeping with ones oh so handsome husband to at least have children?  It makes zero zero sense, especially since Alexandra loves her home so much that she never wants to leave.  Wouldn't she want a child of hers to inherit?  The romance between Niall and Alec is not very interesting, basically not in existence.  What blows my mind is that Geoffrey tries to kill Niall several times.  Alec refuses to believe it when Niall tries to tell her. When Geoff finally admits it to her, she wonders how soon he can come calling on her again where Niall won't be mad....what?  Oh, yes, attempt to kill my husband by buring him alive, running him down with a coach, shooting, well, let us all be friends and come for tea.  How stupid was that...	2001-03-28

They must have been reading a different book.  Enough reviewers have already given the plot.  I will only say that the romance needed real help. The books opening had lots of promise but the juvenile behavior of Elizabeth for the last 100 or so pages was absurd.  James should have gone off to London to meet someone else.  I agree that it was crazy and cruel of Elizabeth to treat James the way she did, and his friends too.  What was the point?  Are we, the reader, supposed to think better of Elizabeth - that she was smart or something?  That fateful word of regency authors is &quot;pluky&quot;.  Her little sister was &quot;pluky&quot;, Elizabeth, however, was a horror.  I have found with other Julia Quinn books she tries to be too cute, and always draws the endings out too long.

He thinks he will die at 39, some family thing or another.  He decides on the most beautiful girl in the ton, Kate.  Kate, though, presents all her possible suitors to her homely, smart older sister, Edwina.  Edwina, who rejects Anthony for her sister because he is a rake, ends up marrying him.  Oh, they were compromised.  Do romance authors feel that must amuse or sooth their readers by making plain women romantic leads?  They are always too smart and clever and &quot;pluky&quot; for their own good.  Why, in reality, would Edwina reject Anthony for her sister?  He was the catch of the ton, good-looking, rich, a tad rakish, but every regency is happy to tell the reader that they make the best husbands.  It was boring, boring, boring, boring...	2001-03-28

Olivia, our heroine, keeps track of the males in the ton and writes descriptions of them in a book she keeps.  She meets up one evening with Lord Hawke, who is drunk and he makes a play for her.  Olivia's father was a drunk, though a handsome one at that.  She pegs Lord Hawke as a seducer of woman and a drunk like her dad.  But Lord Hawke, a war hero, is far more than that.  However, we get an entire book of Olivia refusing his advances even though she is attracted to him because she think he is like her dad.  An entire book.  Also, early on we learn that Lord Hawke drinks at night because he is fearful of sleep in the dark due to war nightmares.  He is not really a drunk and Olivia is aware of why he drinks, though not the particulars.  This book was a bore of a read with Olivia at ever turn turning away Neville Hawke.  It simply went on to long.  It is only the very last page of over 200 pages that she finally agrees to marry him and admit her feelings.  And we then also learn exactly why he has nightmares.

Also, I agree with a previous reader that she might have been a bit young, but more importantly, she was too immature for a good romantic heroine.  What is up with Joan Wolf and brides who refuse marital relations?  It is totally illogical that a Prince, who would certainly need an heir, would allow a bride not to fulfill her wifely duty as his princess and bride.  Also totally silly that she would be upset that he conducted a brief affair after they were married.  After all, she was not sleeping with him and he was a devilishly handsome man.  The Vienna intrigues were interesting but the romance was too been there, done that for Joan Wolf.  I wish she would go back to her third party stories.  I realize that in the 18-19 centuries, brides were generally young, but readers today are not and if authors want teenagers as brides in their stories, at least make them mature.	2001-03-08

While everyone has different likes and dislikes, this is no 5 star story.  Why do authors think that spunky women, who refuse to listen to reason, are &quot;romanctic&quot;?  Exciting?  No, they are just senseless.  Phoebe, a ragged lady with no graces, is so painfully dowdy that the author leaves no room for growth in her character.  She refuses to listten to anybody and that is a very negative characteristic.  She put her husband in grave danger, plus her step-daughter.  And it is foolish for any reader to think that Cato, our dashing hero, would look upon Phoebe's antics as endearing.  He is a military man and he would let her come along on secret military dealings?  Because he does when he finds her hiding more than one.  Perhaps the author wanted to use those moments to point out how flexible Cato.  But he should not have been.  Secret government work is just that and for Phobe to complain that she was his wife and entitled to know all was stuipd. Military secrets are just that - secrets.  She was a vastly unappealing charater and not just physically.  She behaved with zero ability as the lady of the manor and in that time frame, that would have been paramount.  Poor reading and poor story.	2001-03-01

Our heroine, Clare Cummings met Justin St. John when she was 14 and fell in love with him, an established rake.  For 2 years, she sneaks into his castle when he is in town and they have a friendly relationship, but she thinks he is her prince and loves him.  Her dad finds out, threatens Justin and tells him he needs to marry her and he refuses.  Clare finds out and runs to talk to him but finds him in bed with one of her maids.  Flash forward 2 years and she is in London for the season.  She meets him again but thinks she hates him.  He, however, finds out she is to marry an evil man and to protect her, steals her away to Scotland to marry. She does so but spends a 100 pages or so refusing his marital rights because she can not get the picture of him in bed with her maid out of her mind.  Then why marry him? Before they married, he told her she could live anywhere and he would always take care of her but she said that she wanted a real marriage and he agreed.  She demanded he give up drinking, gambling,  other women and they would have to live in the falling down castle.  One day she comes upon him without his shirt and she nearly kills him.  It was hard to read, how foolish she was.  It was so immature and illogical that I wish Ms. Simmons had perhaps made her older, or something in which a reader could relate to.  He tells her he loves her but does not matter for too many pages.  Painful read...	2001-02-26

I generally enjoy Joan Wolf's regencies but this one, a romance with a 17 year old girl, was not very interesting.  After all, she is just a girl and would be considered jail bait here in the U.S.A. and rightly so.  While people generally married at a much younger age in those days, it would have been better, from a sexual, romantic and relationship point of view to have our heroine perhaps 19????  Sexual scenes with such young girls are sort of creepy.  My niece is 17, for goodness sakes. And she is far from mature.  Besides, how interesting is a 17 year old?  Not much...	2001-02-22

I hate it when romance writers try to write female leads as independent misses when in reality they are really just stubborn.  Ms. Johnson's Flora is such a gal.  Flora - because she is &quot;smart and independent&quot; - disobeys Adam and practically gets him killed!  Oh, but she is independent, so it is okay.  Sometimes it pays to listen to others; refusing to listen to others really makes one stupid, not independent.  Flora was one forward gal for the age the story was written in.  I have to agree with another reviewer who pointed out that Adam (our gorgeous hero) and Flora meet and in a few quick dance steps are out the door doing it in a carriage.  He would have tipped his hat (if he had one) and said thanks and not really thought that much more about her again.  Especially since she made it clear he was not the first.  Also, the story should have been a bit shorter - too many issues get in the way.	2001-02-09

She really was not that wicked to begin with - her behavior with Gerald was not rape, please. Not even close.  She was lonely, young, unhappy, and Ms. Balogh makes what happened to be a graver sin than it was. That is why I hated that other book.  In this book, Helena ends up marrying Cora's brother, Cora from &quot;The Famous Heroine&quot;, Edgar Downes, a wealthy, handsome merchant, who is a really good guy.  He actually deserved someone nicer than she. Her constant smirking was overly done.  Her constant feelings of being unlovable because of one instance of non-sex with Gerald was overplayed to the point of lunacy.  I like regencies that do not have the standard silly milk and water virginal misses.  This book could have been much better. Helena was a great conversationalist, smart, attractive and it would have been more interesting to allow her to be, well, real without always haveing to be wicked or for her to always feel wicked.	2001-01-26

However, I felt that the book explained enough of Hugh's history as a prisoner in Windermere and his 2 years of torture, that it was not necessry.  I did like this book (sort of) but there were two glaring issues that prevented it from being a better story.  First, Hugh, as we all know, was tortured and maimed. His eye was poked out, he lost a toe, finger, has facial scars.  However, the author seems to have forgotten that the time in which the story is set, 1423, people were pretty ugly in general. Small pox left many, including member of the nobility, severly scared.  The brother of Queen Margot of France had small pox and was so scared his nose was split in two.  Many others had scars from daily living, from fire, knives, falls, etc. Really - who, especially women who seemed to lose a tooth per child, had many teeth in those days? So Hugh without an eye really would not have made the women of that time bat an eye.  That was an unfortuate running plotline that the author built up - that people shunned him for his scars, which were not that awful.  Hugh was a knight, for goodness sakes.  He would have been used to and accepting of bodily injury.  Also, not until practially the last page does Hugh tells Siam that he is not engaged.  That was unkind as Sian was so sad becasue he was to marry another. So in the end, I guess I did not really like it!	2001-01-24

Catriona, a lass from the highlands, comes to tell Dominic Harriet is now dead and that there is a child he must claim. Of course, he knows it is no child of his but he decides to go with Catriona and will only go if she is his mistress.

Catriona, throughout the entire novel, tells him no and many ways and in many situations.  Of course, the reader knows her no means yes but how would Dominic?  It is ashame that with all that is going on in society today a silly book is published that women still find romantic when the hero, Dominic, does nothing but humiliate, belittle, scorn and use, yes, use, for his own dark demons.

Bella basically grew up following her father in the war.  She is an army brat, of sorts.  Philippe Armitage was one of Wellington's favorite mapmakers, who fell in love wiht Bella and asked her father if he could marry her and he refused.  After a night of passion between the two, they became engaged but Philippe was supposed to have been killed in battle and Bella married his cousin, Edwin, the duke, instead.  But Philippe is not dead and hence another author has written a story about marrying the wrong man when you think your lover is dead.  This story has been done so many times and much better.  You have the traditional question regarding who the child's father really is (and we guess that within the first chapter).  Also, within the first 10 pages, we know Bella still loves Phillipe, he still loves her, loves Jamie.  But he thinks she betrayed him to marry the duke, someone who obviously had more money.  So than we have to go through some 400 pages, yes, 400 pages, of them constantly fighting!  She is a silly woman who does not want to accept reality that hey - the war is over and you can relax.  She is always gunning for a fight.  And Phillipe was so stubborn it was painful to read.  I don't know why authors feel that for a woman to be respected or thought to be smart she has to be so argumentive.  The story was almost impossible to finish.	2001-01-12

She not only ran to her parents home, but ran to them in a middle of a ball with Dominic following her.  There, she declares to all, that he used her in an awful manner.  Thus, the ton gives him the direct cut and excludes him from their circle.  Dominic than has to enlist in the army where he becomes a valued spy. Harriet wants the marriage annulled but then she was pregnant.  WHen she finds out Dominic is returning from war she throws herself down the stairs to purposely lose their child.  Oh, than she leaves for a convent in Scotland.  First of all, this is just stupid.  Dominic is a gorgeous man who was very popular with the ladies both before and after his marriage.  And with many women of the Ton so obviously they would know if he has strange bed habits, which he did not.  So why was he shunned for so long?  Also, he was a bit of a hot head and the reason Harriet was so turned off by him was that she preferred women, not men.  One would have expected a young hot male to defend himself against her slurs.  Not just sit by and say nothing.  Than Catriona Sinclair, a miss from the highlands, comes to tell him Harriet is dead and that there is a child.  He knows it is no child of his and he knows Harriet did not like men so whose child is it?  So off he goes with Catriona with an inspid seven deadly sins wager.  Who cares?  Why was he even interested in Catriona?  And I hate when authors portray men as unable to keep it in the pans, that he was so overwhelmed with lust that he must have her sort of thing.  Dominic was a spy for goodness sakes.  I think he could manage to control himself, especially towards a female who is, by his own admission, not pretty and she finds Dominic a jerk and he knows it.  The book really insulted my intelligence!	2001-01-10

I find I am bored with missish females  and overdone plots.  A friend suggested I try a Joan Wolf book.  I found  this book to be a really good read.  Annabelle, widowed with a small son  named Giles, finds out at the reading of the will of her now dead husband  that he has named his banished brother, Stephen, as the guardian to their  son, Giles.  Annabelle hates Stephen (or so she tries to tell herself) as  they were lovers 5 years earlier.  Stephen, however, was caught smuggling  and was sent to Jamaica and left without a word to Annabelle.  Ms. Wolf  writes nicely and descriptively about how the relationship becomes  rekindled between them, even though Annabelle still has feelings of hurt.   I did not have to wade through 200 pages to have the romance resolved.   What was resolved by the end of the book with who was trying to murder  Stephen.  A great read.  My only complaint would be that I never got a firm  image of what Stephen or Annabelle looked like.  Apparently Annabelle was a  beauty but not sure about Stephen.	2000-08-15
