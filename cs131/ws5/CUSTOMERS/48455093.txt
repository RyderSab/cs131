It is a wonderful, sarcastic, interesting story. It is not supposed to be a Harry Potter and does not take itself that seriously.

I highly recommend this book!	2004-07-26

At first I was sorry there was going to be very little Jean-Claude in the book.  But, I told myself the story alone could be very good.  The story was good, up to a point.  Unfortunately, Hamilton began the \\"Anita as Sex Power Machine Girl\\" thread that the next two books in the series, especially Narcissus in Chains, appear to be built around.  The good story is overpowered by the gratuitous sex.  Though I can see the plot development using sex, I think it could have been done in a much better, perhaps subtler way.  All in all, the only reason I continued to read books 9 and 10 in the series after this one is because I kept hoping they'd get better, return to the wonderful page turners of books 1 - 7.  If the new book due out in April does not give me what I have always loved in this series I am done with Anita Blake.	2003-02-23

The fictional world created by Diamant seemed very plausible, and the book reminded me that throughout the history of the world the contributions and knowledge of women have been frequently ignored and/or forgotten.  Through its fictional portrayal this book reminds me that just because it was not written down or remembered, it does not mean it did not exist.  To the reviewers who complained that its &quot;not like the Bible&quot; - the book IS FICTION, and, frankly, if you can't handle fiction based on what only some people believe to have been fact, then you may need to consider broadening your scope of the world.

I am an adult reader and this book reminded me of the old Bugs Bunny cartoons, the ones where viewers of all ages found something to their taste.  Violence is a part of this story of a criminal mastermind, but just one part.  I found it was used appropriately, and several characters in the book routinely demonstrate that a good intellect is superior to a weapon.  The book does not drip with morality, which is precisley why I believe it is very effective at communicating the fact that Artemis is just a little boy who wants his mommy and daddy - regardless of what he says or does.	2003-01-16

That said, this book was very interesting in that it helped me understand some of the central texts revered by others.  I only read about 60% - 75% of it though.  I stopped reading when one of the chapters in the book made it glowingly clear to me where the hatred of those who are not &quot;us&quot; stems from in one religion.

They covered neither too few occasions nor too many (I was afraid that if I got a book with too many headings I would leave many blank for lack of time to constantly update).

Overall, I must commend the books.  The colors are brilliant, the images full and fun for our child (she's been enjoying the books since she was 6 months old and is now a year old).  I also am happy that the book has board pages.  I have, however, two complaints regarding the translation.  1)The book introduces animals in English as fish, but in Spanish as \\"el pescado.\\"  I see no reason to put the word \\"the\\" in front of the Spanish but not in front of the English (either \\"the fish\\" and \\"el pescado\\" or just \\"fish\\" and \\"pescado.\\"  This is done throughout the book.  Another problem, for me at least, is that the book gets the Spanish word for the color brown wrong.  It says \\"cafe\\" is Spanish for brown - well the only thing I have heard Spanish speakers call \\"cafe\\" is coffee!  Just to see if that has to do with the fact that I do not know persons from all Spanish speaking nations (but I do know Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Ecuadorians, Argentinians, Panamanians, Columbians, Peruvians, and Spanish) I looked it up in a Larousse Grand Dictionary.  For the color brown the following Spanish words are offered: \\"carmelita,\\" \\"marron,\\" \\"castano\\" (which means brunette).  The sole definition under \\"cafe\\" is coffee.  A book that presents itself as a learning tool should not make an error like this.	2002-11-20

Firmat does a good job at showing that we are not alone in thinking that no matter how American/Cuban we are, we are just not American or Cuban.  That said, however, my problem with the book is the fact that I feel that while the author does a good job at showing the divergent tugs on a refugee's heartstrings, at the end, the book left me flat, without a resolution.

I am tired of hearing that bilingual education works.  Human nature is such that we all gravitate to the easy road in life.  This is the central problem with bilingual education.  There is no incentive to put yourself through the humiliation of speaking a foreign language if you have no incentive.  I learned to speak English at the age of five (as of yet my parents do not speak it).  From the minute I entered grammar school I was placed in a classroom full of English speaking kids.  I wanted to play with them and show I was not dumb - so I did the only thing I could, I learned to speak English.  (PS - at this point you may say I had wonderfully supportive parents - NEVER HAPPENED, that had nothing to do with my success).  I have scored in the 98th and 99th percentiles in my SAT, LSAT, and GMAT English tests.  When a grammar expert is needed at my office, I am called upon.  I am also not that unusual, just ask the other bilingual kids I went to school with who learned English the same way I did.  Stop telling me self esteem is earned by gently guiding kids into a new language - the only thing that gentle guidance teaches kids is that they don't have to put themselves through the trauma of learning.  Yes, trauma is terrible, but it is also a wonderful teacher.  Only by experiencing that trauma will children ever have true self-esteem.  Only then will they earn and enjoy the feeling of accomplishment learning a new language will give them.  Only then will they have an opportunity to succeed in America.  The premise of this book is ridiculous - why don't these authors ever inteview the children who lived in bilingual worlds, like me?  Why is it that all of the children who learn English in bilingual programs say its successful, yet I never meet them at any professional association luncheons, see them running their own companies, call them Doctor or counselor, or find them in anything but low paying difficult jobs?  Those jobs are great if they are what you want out of life, not great if they are all you can get out of life and book like these don't seem to point out that children educated in bilingual programs end up there because other opportunities are forecloseded to them.  Push them to learn they will, show them they don't have to, they won't.	2001-03-25

The way Barrios describes her grandmother, the beliefs of  santeria, the spirit of family and friends, her way of life, is so vivid  one can almost hear the voices and feel the emotions that must have been  involved.  Her book may be able to explain, at least to those unfamiliar  with the Cuban community in the US, the many reasons why, over four decades  after the revolution and their escape, they can neither forgive nor forget  what became of the life they so adored.  <br />As a child born in Cuba, but  raised in the US from the age of 4, I have made an effort over the last 10  years to learn about the country and way of life I never knew.  Barrios  describes the loss of history, family, and faith in a stable universe any  forced immigrant must experience.  She does honor to both the old Cuba and  the new Cuban-Americans who survived their birth in the new Cuba by leaving  its shores.  For those of us who left the island before developing a sense  of self, who feel a little poorer for never knowing what having a homeland  must be like (where all on the street know your myths and folklore) she  reveals what it must have been like and why we had to leave it behind.	2000-09-13

WRONG.  The  only character in the book I actually liked and cared about was Theresa,  and it was not her story.  Though a lot takes place in this novel (death,  prison, false accusations) and it reveals life truths (such as the fact  that many spouses don't know each other and one's seemingly safe life can  snap in one minute, without the slightest hint of forewarning), it left me  saying - &quot;Oh, deal with it.&quot;  The novel held no great revelations  for me, nor did I find the central characters compelling in any way.  Far  worse things have ocurred to others not as well situated, and they have  conquered their demons with more grace, common sense, and ability.  Better  novels have told similar tales in more compelling fashion.	2000-09-02
