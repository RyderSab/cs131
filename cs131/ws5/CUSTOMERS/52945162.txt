There is little in this world that can be as terrifying yet as satisfying as crawling into a blazing building and cheating death and fire by escaping and beating the fire down. In 25 years with fire departments, I have never read a story that depictes the courage and fear involved in firefighting with the scope, depth and compasion as this book does. It actually stood the hairs on my arms up several times and caused me to have several flashbacks to those \\"tougher\\" fires in my life.<br />In addition, I was pleased to see the author treat firefighting with just enough simplicity for laymen, yet with enough attention to detail to capture the minds of firefighters themselves.<br />This is a must read!!	2003-05-24

I found the majority of material to be related to 9/11 or to wildland firefighting while the cover implies it covers all ranges of firefighting. The material included is good...it just spends very little time on structural firefighting and the men who do that job. What time it does dedicate to it is mostly in the form of re-hash of previous material; Report from Engine Co 82, Working etc. There are better books out there, unless you are interested in wildland firefighting. If you are, then this is one of the better books on the subject.	2003-05-24

Having lived in Philadelphia for over 20 years, there were much more interesting stories floating around.<br />Individually, these stories were great for their original intended purpose as filler in a magazine, but as a book it is quite lacking. While it might be fun to check out of the library, I certainly wouldn't put down hard earned money to buy it.	2002-05-31

I have yet to find one that was balanced and this book is no exception.<br />From the title and information on the dust jacket, etc., you expect an insiders look at the death penalty and the men who are given the unenviable task of applying it. Instead, what you get (primarily) is a look at the death house at Mississippi's infamous Parchman Prison and the 2 men who oversaw 3 executions there in the 1980s. The only form of execution that is covered, in a more than passing fashion, is the gas chamber, which as the book was published had been done away with in every state in the US.<br />To cover this subject fully, the author needed to explore the other types of execution in the US and speak to executioners in more than one state and who have performed executions by more than this method alone. His focus on death by gassing, which may be the most miserable form of death, is in itself, a staement against the death penalty.<br />There are better books on the history, types and operation of various execution methods. For a true view of the subject, I suggest one of them.	2002-05-25

This is no exception. The mystery involved is wonderful and will have you guessing all the way throught the book.<br />I also had to admire his treatment of alcohlism in this book. While most books make drinking...even to excess... a virtue, Parker attacks the subject straight on and deals with the demons of the disease well enough to make me wonder if he has been down the road himself.<br />The one downfall to this book is Jesse Stones inability to speak in more than 2 or 3 word sentances, much like Spenser. In fact, almost every time Stone speaks, my mind conjured up Spenser. Parker needs to work on removing himself from Spenser while writing his other works.	2002-05-25

While the writing is well within in capabilities of most 4-6 graders, the subject may be a little touchy for the younger end of the group. I would be reluctant to let a sensative child read this book until at least the 5th grade.<br />That said, I think the book was wonderful.The writing is well done for children's non-fiction, but also is able to capture adult readers. The book is a fascinating story about one of the few surviving children who rode one of the orphan trains as well as the general story of the trains history.<br />My wife, 11 year old daughter and I read the book (my wife and I in 1 evening, my daughter the next) and then we discussed the concept of the trains, the needs for them and why such things are no longer in use in today's society. It made for a good family discussion and we all learned from the experience.<br />This book has very good content, as well as interesting information about the sociology of this country's past. It was well worth the read for both adults and our daughter and we all enjoyed it.	2002-05-08

We bought this when my daughter was about 4 years old and it quickly became her favorite book. She had an incredible ability to locate items in the photographs that boggled my mind. And, she never tired of finding those items. She is now 11 and just gave the book up.<br />I was amazed by the beautiful photographs and the fantastic way the items are hidden in the photgraphs.

Billy the Kid is one of the West's most famous outlaws, yet there is little in the history books to detail his short but very violent life. In addition, most of what has been written has been written in the later part of the 20th century and relies not so much on true knowledge as on what can be found here and there.<br />This book, original written in 1924, is wonderful because the author actually found people still alive who had known Billy the Kid and who had lived through the Lincoln County Wars. While these people were hardly young when interviewed, they still had very good memories of Billy and his life style. This provides a look that is often missing in history.<br />One area that was missing was any detailed information on the early life of Billy the Kid, but, as the author points out, much was lost and may never be known.<br />The language in the book is, at times, difficult to process, as it was written in the style prevalent in 1924, not 2002. And it is a language that is caught between the older American English and modern American English. Generally it is a smooth read, but does have a couple of rough spots.<br />This is a MUST READ if you really want to know about the portion of Billy the Kids life that ocured during the Linclon County Wars!!	2002-03-31

As a retired fifefighter and author, Dennis Smith was in a rather unique position on 9/11. He went to volunteer his services with Ladder 16 and was on the front lines during the most horrific days in America's history. Having retired from an Engine Co. in the South Bronx, he was very qualified to assist and bear witness to events.<br />He details the scene, the people, the thoughts that were going through most firefighters minds and he interviews a number of other people on the scene, giving different perspectives. One of the most wondeful things about this book is how it puts things into a nice time frame where you can actually figure out what happened when. So much was jumbled that day and this really clarifies the events.<br />Smith has a wonderful style of writing and has the unique ability to take terms and language from the fire service and translate them into easly understood concept by laymen, without making you feel like a fool for not understanding the rather strange language of firefighters.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand more about what happened on that fateful day, and needs a better understanding of how nearly 400 emergency service workers died. This book will give you the answers. There is also the added benefit of the publisher's and author's donation of proceeds from the book to charity.<br />A \\"Need To\\" Read!!!	2002-03-20

It is a detailed history of dining car service aboard the Southern Pacific from the beginning of the service until the service was terminated...along with SP passenger service. I found the information on how food was obtained and stored, the use of commisaries, as well as preperation of food prior to departure to be an interesting look at how the railroads handled food service.<br />The book was written in any easy style and is an enjoyable read. It is a bit pricey, but aren't most specialty books?	2002-02-14

When I bought and read this book, I did so to gain information on the history, design, and construction of the World Trade Towers. Although they were built while I was growing up, I never thought much about them. And I still do not know much more about them than I did prior to reading this book.<br />This book covers a number of issues, including a detailed history of the Port Authority, the social and economic history of New York City from about 1900 to the current, and information on the impact of the towers on the p[opulation who lived and worked where they are located. What this book does not cover, in any detail, is a history of the Towers. There are maybe a total of 5 pages on the design and construction of the project....hardly what I call a biography.<br />While reading this, I had the disticnt feeling the author may have grown up in the area that was redeveloped by the Port Authority into the Twin Towers and was bitter about the dislocation. He certainly had some kind of axe to grind as this hardly seemed to be an unbiased look at the subject.<br />Finally, the writing was out of the doctoral thesis school of writing. While it did get better as the book went along, I had to dictionary  my way through the early parts of the book. It almost felt like it was written by someone who had swallowed a thesaurus.<br />If you want a true biography and history of the World Trade Centers, find another book.	2002-02-06

This was a wonderful book about the exploits of a criminal, Gerald Chapman, who lived in the early part of the 20th century and has the distinct bragging rites to being called &quot;Public Enemy No.1&quot;. Not by the FBI, actually, but by the press.<br />The story is well written and reads much more like a crime novel than a work of non-fiction. It covers the life of Chapman and explores his exploits in crime. And, what exploits they were! If there was a crime available to commit, he gave it a try.<br />It's really a shame the book is out of print. If you can find one, buy it and enjoy!!	2001-09-10

However, it was almost all rehashed material from the work he writes for Vanity Fair.<br />Reading this, I felt like I was watching a TV show where the writers couldn't come up with enough new material for the show so they do a flashback episode where about 10% is new material and the remainder is previously shown material. Dunne did the same thing here. No new crimes or material to work with, need a book, so crank out the old with a few updates on where the cases have progressed to.<br />In addition, much of the material was very dated. I don't think there is much left to say or know about the OJ trial, yet about 1/2 the book was related to that case. Yawn!<br />Save the money and take it out of the library if your a Dunne fan, otherwise skip it.	2001-09-10

So, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of &quot;Gunman's Rhapsody&quot;...and I ended up sorely disappointed. I have been to Tombstone, read a number of books about the town and it's famous citizens and have always been interested in the full story behaind the incidents there that made the town famous. This did little to shed any new light on an old subject. And, I am fearful that people will read this and take it for actual history, which of course, it isn't...it's a novel. In addition, either Robert Parker based Wyatt Earp on Spenser or Spenser was based on Wyatt Earp. I tend to believe the former. Either way, the dialouge is so similar to a Spenser novel that I felt, at times, that I was reading the latest Spenser novel. I guess Parker has been writing the Spenser books so long he has forgotten what real dialouge is like. There is one good point to the book. It makes the story so easy to follow that anyone who wants to know about the story of the Earps and Tombstone can read this and get the basic story fairly quickly without having to read through some of the drier history books.	2001-08-26

If you should stumble onto the subject in written form, it rarely, if ever, raises it to the level of profession, yet that is what Debra Ginsberg has done.<br />She gives us a look at a job that is usually frowned upon as a career in a way that will make you realize that maybe it is a career, and a good one at that.<br />I found the stories about the activities at the estableshments where she worked funny, interesting and at times, disgusting. But, whatever the story of the moment, it is told in a well written and enjoyable fashion.<br />In addition to the waitressing stories, we are treated to a look inside her world growing up from mid teens to late thiries. This is intertwined with the stories about the restaurant business and makes for a wonderful read.<br />Anyone who has ever eaten in a restaurant should read this book....it will give you a whole new way of looking at your surroundings.	2001-08-23

There are a number of books regarding the criminally insane written by doctors,and by &quot;true crime&quot; writers but this is the first I have ever seen written by, and from the perspective of an attorney.<br />The writing is well done, and the book is easy to read. It isn't written in legalese so that anyone can read it and enjoy it. The author did a wonderful job of presenting a variety of cases and was not shy about his hesitancy to deal with certain of those cases. He also provided some interesting insights into the problems faced by the &quot;criminally insane&quot;, the attorneys who represent them and the system and offered a number of solutions to these problems.<br />This is a book well worth reading, particularly if you are interested in mental health or criminal justice.	2001-08-16

And, to an extent, it was.<br />If you can believe that prehaps 3 dozen men founded, organized, operated and developed the policies of the Department over the last 155 years, and that they were crooked, inept, stupid,and brutal, then you will find this to be a good read.<br />What I found was the stories of about 3 dozen men who had the qualities I mentioned above and whose exploits were detailed at length. And, no matter how these people behaved, the authors had to find something wrong with it. In fact, in several places they seem to contradict themselves as to what should have been the appropriate handling of a situation. And, there really never is any thesis to the book or follow up as to what the authors believed happened. It seems more to be a detailing of fact; little beyond that.<br />This would be a good book if it were titled, &quot;NYPD: A History of Graft, Corruption and Stupidity&quot; and it was used as a text book for a class at John Jay College in that subject area, but it is a book that is far from a representative of the history of the men in blue in New York.<br />In addition to those faults, I found the book difficult to read. One moment they are following a chronilogical sequence, then they are following a different line. It made it tough to keep track of the people detailed.<br />If you want a good book about the New York Police Department history, find it elsewhere. If you are a historian and wish to add one small peice of the story to your collection then maybe this book would be a good buy.	2001-08-10

(You really have to be into a project to do something like that!!)<br />After a time, she decided to learn more about the women who work there and see what their lives were like and why they came into the business. It was certainly eye opening and sheds new light onto the long lingering question of whether legalized prostitution would be a viable solution to the street walkers plying our large cities today.<br />I found the book fascinating, well researched and very readable. I was also impressed by the information and the conclusions. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is concern about the social problems of today, as well as policy makers in our cities. Its also a great read just to learn a little about the world of leaglized prostitution.	2001-08-07

Interwoven with that was the story of the Federal Bureau of Prisons attempts to quiet the man who was exposing their dirty laundry.<br />Dannie Martin is a natural writer with a wonderful sense of humor.

At this point the book became much more interesting and contained information that left my mind reeling. And, I think he touched very well on the corporate attitude that is making humans expendable at the cost of increased stock prices and bigger dividends.<br />If you read this book be prepared to have a strong stomach...to handle what you will learn about the meat industry, the food we eat, the fast food industry and how workers in this country are treated.	2001-07-18

I found this book to be extremely interesting and thought provoking. It made me realize why my 401K plan has done so well for the past 10 years....companies value stock return above all else...even people.<br />I think the idea for the book and the &quot;uderground&quot; investigation was excellent, and the book was very well written. I was, however, dismayed by some of the techniques used...such as trying to survive as a working poor in an area where she lived and already had an idea of the job and housing situation. Also, I questioned her taking along emergency money. It would have been a much more realistic study had she gone out with no &quot;backup&quot; funds.<br />With those faults aside, I think she came to valid conclusions and we should send a copy of this book to every member of Congress to let them see what &quot;soft money&quot; campaign donations has led to. I was amazed at my own reaction after finishing the book. I stopped and thought about the maid who was making up my hotel room, the wait staff who brought my food, etc. It made me think a lot harder about the tip I was going to leave. It also made me think long and hard about writing to my Congressmen about an increase in the minimum wage.	2001-07-18

About 1/3 are fiction and rarely would I even consider reading a book of this nature. I did, however, see a lot of publicity and I got curious about the book so I bought it and sat down to read it.<br />First, I read it in 2 sittings, which is very unusual for me. Secondly, I started to laugh out loud with the first 10-15 pages which caused my wife to think there was something wrong with me physically. She could not remember the last time she had heard me laugh out loud at a book.<br />I'm a male, married, and about as unlikely to read this book as anyone, yet I read it and enjoyed it totally. I related to the characters, the situations and to Bridget's quirky life.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh. Just brush up on your British slang a bit first!	2001-07-12

The book is a fascinating look at life for a 1st year student at what is, arguably, the best law school in the United States. And, the look is interesting and eye-opening.<br />The but part is that it drags and gets repetative. It was about 1/2 way through when I started thinking...all right, let's get to the end of the year.<br />It's a book worth reading, but don't expect it to keep you glued to your seat.	2001-07-12

I kept thinking I had it figured out, and then something would change and it would be back to square one again.<br />The writing was very well done and the book flowed smoothly. The only thing that disappointed me was that the characters and the story seemed a bit contrived. Some of it just wasn't believeable to me.<br />Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to read it, but I also would consider it a good &quot;airplane&quot; or &quot;travel&quot; book.	2001-07-12

There are several reasons behind these feelings. I have read a number of books on the subject and most are written in the tone of a PhD thesis. This book was very readable and read more like a novel than a historical work. The author wove the information together in the form of a story rather than as a dry recitation of fact. Additionally, I enjoyed the approach taken by the author. The book starts with an early history of the Islands, and then moves onto the days right before the attack using real people and their families to bring a sense of what life was like in Hawaii before the attack and why the attack so devistated so many people. Following are details of the attack, the way in which it changed people and then into the life of modern Hawaii and the lingering affects of the bombing. This was throughly enjoying and made me understand the events of December 7th in a whole new light!!	2001-07-06

It can be a real eye opener for people who think they have thier debts under control. One of the most fascinating portions of the book focuses on how the industry preys upon the people who need the credit the most and how these people are gouged for fees that are excessive. I think this book should be read by every high school student as part of a preface to joining the &quot;real&quot; world!	2001-06-24

I have had significant contact with women in prison while doing prison reform work and I am also working with an inmate on her case. Therefore, I think I have a pretty good idea of what Ms. Furio went through to get the information for this book and how difficult it was for her to communicate with these women. Although female inmates are easier to get through to than men, they still are extremely cautious with writers and reporters, even with member of their legal team...and with good reason. It takes quite a bit of time to gain the trust needed, and then you only get the basics. Very few inmates of either sex are going to open up for ANY reason, as it might hurt appeals, etc. I think Ms. Furio did an admirable job of getting these women to allow us into their private forms of hell...their thoughts and feelings about the crimes of which they have been convicted. And, for many inmates, living with their thought is a private hell. The woman I am working with is profiled in the book, and I know how hard it was for her to decide to allow Ms. Furio to use her information and very private thoughts. She asked me for my opinion several times and I had to tell her it was her choice; no one could make it for her. The writing is somewhat simple, but this is not a PhD thesis and these women are, for the most part, not well educated, so you have to bring your writing down to their level. That said, I think the book is very worthwhile as it allows us a view of women prisoners rarely seen or heard, and removes the sensationalism from the crimes. Maybe that is why some of the other reviewers are so down on the book...they wanted the &quot;gory details&quot; and were denied them. Finally, I think the book allows a rare glimpse of the strange and bizarre rules and regulations of prison life. (As an aside, 1,000 copies of the book were printed by mistake before the proof reading was completed...the reason for the typos. It has since been corrected)ason for the typos. It has since been corrected)	2001-06-14
US	52945162	R2QJ1ILWU9SZ42	0451198301	65205783	Torch	Books	5	7	7	N	Y	EXCITING, AUTHENTIC AND ENGROSSING	This is an extremely accurate mystery about fire and arson investigation. It will take you into the way things are truly done, within the confims of a fictional book. The book is loaded with twists and turns, and has a major  shock right in the begining. It was hard to put down, and I enjoyed every  minute of it...even after the 3rd reading. I was one of Ms. Mills technical  advisors, and can testify to the time taken with research. An excellent  read.....buy it and enjoy!!!!	1999-10-07
