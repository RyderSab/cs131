After I had picked the book up I found Rachel Howard's website and saw where she was planning/writing a novel. I have already subscribed to the RSS feed of her site so I can read her postings and find out when this novel is published. Why so excited about an unwritten novel? Read this memoir - her first book - and you'll know why. It reads like fiction and kept me glued to the pages - I read it through in two nights. To recount such a painful time in her life (her father was murdered when she was 10) with such range of emotions, and Rachel's path to putting her era of tragedy behind her makes for powerful reading. I laughed, I was moved, I was kept in suspense, I marveled at the descriptions of those involved and was brought into her world with an ease that defies the fact that this is her first book. She is quite a talent. I look forward to her work in the future as much as any new author in years. This is a can't miss memoir and an easy five-star pick.	2005-08-26

Having read many books about writing, I was looking forward to this because of its provocative title and the hope that there might be \\"something new.\\"  There was all right. To be talked down to in such a rude and condescending style was quite an eye-opener. I noticed in the acknowledgments he said his editors had to remove many bad jokes. I can only imagine. <br /> <br />As for the reviews praising Mr. Walsh for his honesty and \\"telling the brutal truth,\\" I can only say that it is very sad when this kind of dream-killing claptrap is considered \\"honest.\\" It is overwhelmingly negative and rude. I mentioned his crass style, but it goes beyond that to an almost snickering attitude that there are people out there who actually want to get published, yet don't come by way of a referral from a famous author, agent, etc. He seemed to take pride in holding the banner of elitism high. If you are a first-time author he has especially harsh words for your audacity. Don't you know the odds? <br /> <br />No, Pat Walsh is not offering any kind of \\"unvarnished truth,\\" he is offering a confidence blow to many writers who pick this up for inspiration and tips, and find that he employs an almost literary sadism by inflicting mental pain upon anyone daring to think big. For Mr. Walsh, a writer thinking big is a bad thing and \\"unrealistic.\\" It's a blessing that so many of our accomplished writers were not exposed to this book and its constant negative attitude. Walsh was founding editor of MacAdam/Cage Publishers and he insinuates all through the book that you need an inside track to get published if you're a first-time author. With Penguin's publication of this book he certainly proved that to be true in his case. Otherwise, it would be gathering dust in the slush pile.  <br /> <br />An obnoxious book by an arrogant author. One star is generous.  <br /> <br />........	2005-08-24

Never in his wildest dreams did he think he would find himself fired from the job he coveted so much. But even more so, never did he ever expect to find himself in the middle of a murder trial where he played a central role. <br /> <br />Christian Michael Longo decided to become Michael Finkel of the New York Times at almost the exact time Finkel lost his job at the Times. Longo, wanted for the murder of his family in Oregon, had fled to Mexico and assumed the identity of reporter Finkel. All that happens next is something that sounds straight from a Hollywood screenplay. Except, this time there's no deceit to \\"get the story,\\" - it's all real. Finkel finds himself with a true-crime story of a lifetime dropped in his lap. <br /> <br />Another reviewer described this book as \\"genre-busting\\" and I couldn't agree more. This is a story of a reporter's fall from grace, his (sometimes bizarre) relationship with a murderer, and a true crime book that follows the Longo case with many psychological twists and turns. Finkel, throwing convention to the wind, makes it work. <br /> <br />Where Finkel goes from here will ultimately be decided by peers who will decide whether his problems at the NY Times Magazine was an aberration of character that was a mistake, but one that most certainly will not be repeated - or in this day of moral and ethical purity, he is shunned. What a shame that would be. If that's the ultimate take on Finkel, he has a career (if he so desires) as a writer of true crime, bringing his journalistic curiosity to some of the multitudes of heinous criminal behavior that perplexes us all. He's proven he can do that - and do it well. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this \\"genre busting\\" book highly enough.	2005-08-10

Unfortunately, Mr. Chesbro advocates things in this book that will ATTRACT attention. Many of his ideas are okay and can help maintain a low-level of personal privacy. However, he goes off on anti-government tangents and advocates things like questioning governmental authority. In fact, on page 209, Mr. Chesbro writes, \\"Whenever confronted with a government regulation, policy, or agency requirement, the first question you should always ask is, \\"What gives you the authority to require me to do this (or prohibit me from doing this)?\\" The book is loaded with ideas to confront the government and \\"stand up for liberty.\\" Well, that's all fine and good, but NOT for a book called, \\"The Privacy Handbook.\\" Coming across as an anti-government rebel with a cause is the BEST way to get the spotlight ON you - not off. In too many cases, Mr. Chesbro recommends doing things that would do nothing more than flag you as one to watch and offer you LESS - not more - privacy. Better book - by far - is J.J.

After having read the review of the gentleman from Kenosha, WI, I felt I should take the time to offer a more mainstream opinion on this book.<br />The criticism that Dr. Urban's latest title does not lay out a history of linguistics is horribly elitist. The book is not intended to be a linguistics primer or anything other than what it is - a reminder that words are powerful things and a few new thoughts on using words to celebrate life. I found the book very uplifting, and quite thought-provoking, especially concerning the choices we face each day to use language as a positive force in our daily lives, or use it to bring ourselves - and others - down with us. It goes beyond 'positive thinking' to help us consider the power of 'positive language'. I enjoyed Dr. Urban's new book and appreciated the emphasis on how we choose our words each day - for better or worse.	2004-06-14

That may come as a surprise to those on the left who promote the acceptance of trash as \\"tolerance\\"... but \\"shocked\\" is probably being kind as many parents would be flat-out angry at finding their 7th-12th grader in possession of this book.    Let me be honest: This book cannot even be reviewed with the frankness I would like, in using words from the book itself, because Amazon would, rightfully, strike it for being obscene! The editorial reviews above give you a taste.    Teenage boys, for YEARS, have grown up learning right from wrong, but to those who praise this book I suppose that's an oppressive and old-fashioned concept. Books like this - and praise for them - say that it's okay (and right) to use vulgarity, promote pre-marital sex - and more - all in the name of \\"acceptance of young boys angst.\\" Sorry, but some of us still believe you stand up for what is right and true and good and call trash what it deserves to be called - and what this book is - TRASH that belongs nowhere near a junior high library.	2004-04-11

Lieberman laments the lack of interest among young people considering public life and offers reasons why such a life should be one good people pursue.<br />Written before he was considered for the 2000 ticket, the book became his &quot;campaign book,&quot; but is much more than the typical tome in that cheesy genre. Lieberman's IN PRAISE OF PUBLIC LIFE is one portion autobiography, one part civics lesson, a lot of motivational inspiration to seek political office, and just a dash of theology.  It is all woven together in a volume that is fast paced and easy to read.<br />This a great book for those giving even slight thought to a run for public office. Political junkies will love the Senator's detailed description of his political campaigns and his insider look at the U.S. senate. It is what it says - a book in praise of public life, and whether you agree or disagree with Senator Lieberman's positions on the issues, you will most likely end up admiring this man who has given so much to the public square.	2004-02-10

He writes like a seasoned professional - and what a story!<br />There are so many twists and turns and I feel that writing about any of them would be a spoiler. The basic plot is about a young man who loses his parents in a double-suicide that was just a tragic prelude to a harrowing story of deep secrets, conspiracy, and frightening possibilities. You DO ask yourself, &quot;Who knows? Maybe it IS possible,&quot; as Big Brother gets bigger with each passing day.<br />It is also refreshing, by the way, to have a thriller like this set in the Midwest.

I hope for an update soon. There is no question that today's &quot;left&quot; is really not &quot;left&quot; at all - it's just wacky! Gitlin is arguing for a TRUE left...one that focuses on the evils of capitalism and the gulf between the rich and poor. Gitlin wonders what happened to the left that challenged the moneyed class. Instead, today's &quot;left&quot; is all about race, sexual preference, (add the latest &quot;Transgendered&quot; rights), all of these culture wars caught up in Identity Politics and having no interest at all in fighting the class issues of the haves and have nots based on CLASS. Today's left is consumed with their own particular victimizations, rather than as a member of a class that is being oppressed for THAT larger reason. The &quot;left&quot; of today (or what's left of it) MUST wake-up to the realization that they are turning potentially hundreds of thousands of possible progresssives away with way-out &quot;in the ozones&quot; cultural absurdities. Not all, mind you, some such as race have to always play a large role in the fight. However, the left is so splintered into fragments, each fighting their own little corner of the culture wars, that one has to wonder if the idea of progressive and/or socialist unity is impossible. There is NO way all these disparate groups can come together as long as they are trashing white folks just for being white and insisting on absurd things like reperations,.....I just realized, I could go on and on. You get the idea. Gitlin is right on-target and only needs to update this or write another book - as this Identity Politics business that runs off all potential progressives who might join us on CLASS issues and concentration of wealth issues and corporate abuse issues and labor issues erodes the ever smaller foundation of what TRUE &quot;left&quot; there is.

No, it is not the typical John Grisham suspense novel, but this book gave me a greater appreciation for Grisham and his writing abilities. A PAINTED HOUSE is a work of literary fiction that shows Grisham has a command of more than the tried and true lawyer/suspense formula and is darn good at it. I have read some of the unfavorable reviews and have to guess that these are people who rarely venture out of the &quot;reading comfort zone&quot; of popular fiction. Grisham in suspense mode is great, as is Baldacci, Patterson and others. But, there is a whole other world of great writing and Grisham has dared to venture into the serious world of true-blue literary fiction.  <br />The story is narrated by seven year-old Luke Chandler, the son of an Arkansas family renting and farming in 1952 Arkansas. To say Luke &quot;grows up&quot; between the covers would be an understatement. Luke tells us a story of cotton pickers that will have you feeling every possible emotion, right along with young Luke. No, there are no slick lawyers or beautiful law students in A PAINTED HOUSE, but there ARE plenty of wonderful characters that come to life on the pages of this Grisham classic. To stay away from this John Grisham novel because it is not &quot;typical&quot; Grisham, would not be giving yourself enough credit for being able to appreciate a great author, and his work, because he is not writing something that is ready-for-the-screen. Trust the man who brought us THE FIRM, THE PELICAN BRIEF and others to keep you entertained in a different genre, to be sure, but entertained and mesmerized nonetheless. Do yourself a favor -- suspend your judgement about &quot;literary fiction&quot; -- and don't miss this one!!	2001-02-04

EYEWITNESS TO POWER is an excellent book on several levels. <br />One, David Gergen is obviously a pro who has, &quot;been there, done that,&quot; and has some truly fascinating insights into the daily workings of the White House under Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton. I was most taken with his fair treatment of all of these leaders.He tells many tales of the men - warts and all. Gergen offers praise that might surprise you at times and gets tough at times on presidents he clearly admired.<br />Two, Gergen does a remarkable job of describing the Nixon White House - before, during and after Watergate. He has plenty bad to say about the demons that haunted Nixon and the hurt it did our country. However, he also looks at Nixon in a balanced perspective that stresses the intellect of the former president and his truly amazing abilities in the international arena. It is during Gergen's look at the Nixon presidency that we see the highs and lows all equally presented and Gergen telling it as he saw it. It is clear he had a great respect for Nixon's strategic mind. At the same time, he gives us an intriguing look at Nixon's personality that foretold his downfall.<br />Three, This is a book about leadership. EYEWITNESS TO POWER  should be read by all of those in positions of leadership - whether in the public sector, private enterprise or running a local organization. He focuses on the leadership abilities of all four of these men and has some very astute observations that will benefit men and women to become better and more effective leaders.<br />Four, Gergen comes from the communications field. This brings a superb look at these presidents from the perspective of a speechwriter and offers much help to those starting out in public relations and/or journalism.<br />Finally, Gergen, as a Republican, had an interesting tenure with President Clinton that is described with wit and with a sense of disappointment with what might have been. He is clear about his respect for Bill Clinton's political mind and calls him one of our brightest presidents. On the other hand, he saw a president not quite grown up and &quot;settled down&quot; (no further explanation necessary). However, the bottom line on Bill Clinton is he thinks he is a good man who has a few character flaws that prevented him from being a possibly great president. This portion of the book is very fair and balanced from a lifelong Republican political operative.<br />I can highly recommend EYEWITNESS TO POWER, not just for political or history junkies, but for anyone who is looking to lead a company, an organization, or maybe even a nation! Gergen, with great insight - gives us a great read.	2000-12-26

The National Book Foundation had Lightman's latest up as a nominee for the 2000 National Book Award for fiction. I eagerly read THE DIAGNOSIS with great anticipation. I was again disappointed with the &quot;literary&quot; reviews from &quot;serious&quot; reviewers. This book is awful. Is there a kind way to put it?<br />I am at a loss to find the &quot;brilliance&quot; in this novel. There are moments of intense description that show flashes of real talent. Maybe even a remarkable talent. But not near enough of them to salvage the plot, the characters - the book. E-mails (complete with headers) are used throughout the novel, this is an okay device, but the messages which (I guess) were to be more realistic with misspellings and typos were so ridiculous as to be obnoxious. If I received e-mails with typos like those depicted as &quot;normal&quot; in this book from MY attorney, MY physician, etc... I would clearly look elsewhere. Hasn't Mr. Lightman heard of spell check? Does he really think NOBODY uses it? I found this very distracting and it actually achieved the opposite by making the e-mails almost parodies and very unrealistic.<br />The story rises and falls, rises and falls, ultimately going - nowhere. THE DIAGNOSIS is actually a collection of paragraphs, some of which were actually penned with great skill. However, this book goes nowhere. Literally, nowhere. I am trying to write this ever so carefully as to not give anything away but I am now thinking, what could I possibly give away? There's certainly no suspense, no characters that you invest your emotions in, and in the end, you'll be glad you didn't try to get too close. It is one thing for a novel to not have a resolution, I can accept that (and do all the time). What I cannot understand from a book nominated for a National Book Award is a story with not only no resolution, but one with no resolutions of its dozen or more sub-plots. None of whichever really developed and of those that kept me mildly curious - no resolution! What was the purpose? <br />I think about having read some truly great novels (Of Human Bondage, Look Homeward Angel, even On The Road!) and then think back on this book and wonder what Somerset Maugham, especially, would have said about such a novel being recognized as a National Book Award nominee. I can only imagine. It is a bit frightning to me actually to think this is being considered great fiction by some. Are we entering another one of those periods where writers have to write something off-the-wall, breaking all the rules, using cheap device tricks to get noticed, while writing truly poor stories? And then have the publishing house hype it so that reviewers are afraid to be considered fogeys if they don't at least *pretend* they loved it?<br />Summed up: This book belongs on remainder tables, not in lights as a National Book Award nominee. Harsh? I know. But my gosh, THE DIAGNOSIS is awful.	2000-12-09

I was told to read this book and I would never look at christianity the same again. Well, I genuinely respect those who have read this book and found comfort and enjoyment from it. But, I have to be honest........<br />As an agnostic of any &quot;God&quot; and a hardened unbeliever in the &quot;God&quot; of the christian bible, this book did nothing to &quot;enlighten&quot; me. Why? For starters, Mr. Lewis writes of a God other than the one IN the christian bible. You can't take that &quot;God&quot; and then just mold him into something completely different in order to make him more palatable. By the end of this book, I wasn't sure Mr. Lewis and I were even contemplating the same &quot;God&quot;. <br />All one must do to see how cruel the God of the bible is: read it! Read it as if you had never read or heard anything about it before. There is no way you could come away thinking anything other than this &quot;God&quot; is a jealous, murderous, cruel creator. No book can reinvent the God of the bible and make him &quot;more acceptable.&quot; I found myself thinking, &quot;If God really taught this or that, I *might* be able to accept some of this.&quot; But, the cold hard truth is that God doesn't teach all these nice things - again - just read the bible...forget the interpreters...and see if that God and the God of &quot;Encounter with a Prophet&quot; resemble each other in any way.<br />For those who found comfort in this book by Mr. Lewis (who certainly has his heart in the right place)- I say hold onto your faith! I do NOT buy into evangelizing agnosticism and/or atheism. I felt though, an honest review from an unbeliever was needed here since it was given to me by one who truly thought I would rethink my beliefs. With all due respect to C.A. Lewis, I'm just as unconvinced as ever.<br />I understand this is a very delicate topic -- thank you for taking the time to read all the way through my review even if you completely disagree.	2000-11-05

Could the same guy who wrote SAVING FAITH, ABSOLUTE POWER, and those other great suspense novels REALLY write this superb work of literary fiction???? YES! David Baldacci has shown us with this work that he is a not only a great storyteller, but a **wonderful** writer with WISH YOU WELL. <br />A book of rolling emotions that roll like the Virginia countryside in which it is set, WISH YOU WELL will have you willing to wait for another thriller while you revel in this profound story of hope.<br />If you are tempted to say, &quot;I think I'll pass and wait for next 'real' Baldacci book,&quot; do yourself a favor and give WISH YOU WELL a chance. You won't be sorry. This book did me good, very well indeed -- Thank You Mr. Baldacci!	2000-10-28

Frederick Exley (author of A FAN'S NOTES)is someone who would normally be hard to write three paragraphs about - but a whole book? Yes. And with style. MISFIT isn't a full-blown biography, it is a story of a man's life without learning where his grandparent's were born, etc. Yardley gives us much insight into an author who hit the long ball with A FAN'S NOTES and then well.....after reading this book, you'll know why that was the only book in him. Exley authored two other novels, but they are hardly worthy to be mentioned in the same review as Yardley's MISFIT. My suggestion - unless you are a huge Exley fan, read A FAN'S NOTES and then read MISFIT. Then if you feel you must, read the other two - but don't miss this one.	2000-10-25

I was told of its great  spiritual significance. Ha! This book, very frankly, is pure amusement.  SAVED BY THE LIGHT contains mention of 117 (not 115 or  120...117)predictions and &quot;lessons&quot; learned while in heaven.  Folks, the FACT that several have come and gone by there prophesied  designated times is PROOF POSITIVE it is all one of two things: 1) A hoax  to make big bucks in books, movies, tapes and seminars. 2) A misguided  individual who truly believes these things, but alas, has been proven  wrong! There is little difference, as far as credibility goes, in Dannion  Brinkley and doomsday cults who give dates that certain things are going to  happen because &quot;God&quot; told them....only for the dates to come and  go without the scenario playing out. The game is over! For example, we know  the U.S. economy did not implode by the year 2000. How people can see these  &quot;prophesies&quot; passed on from on high by Mr. Brinkley come and go  and STILL give this man the time of day is beyond me.<br />I know there is a  dire need to believe in SOMETHING. That is all fine, but to believe in  Dannion Brinkley, at this point, is intellectually - and spiritually -  impossible!!	2000-09-14

This fair,  balanced, and well-written biography also shows just how complicated a man  Al Gore really is.<br />The vice president's tendency to stretch the truth, we  discover, is nothing new. The authors give some striking examples of this  from his 1988 campaign for president when staffers had to write a memo  telling him how often he is telling tall-tales. The one thread of the book  that comes across clearly, is that Al Gore still lives with a deep  insecurity and a very real need to please his late Father.<br />As I read the  book, I was amazed how often my own feelings toward Al Gore would ride a  wave only to crash, only to read on and catch another wave. The reason is  simple: Al Gore is somewhat of a mystery man. There is a sense from the  authors that he is not really secure in his true self or his positions on  many issues. He is somewhat of an enigma to even those closest to him. Is  he stiff and wooden, or is he a fun-loving guy who is different when the  cameras go off? Is he a loyal-to-a-fault vice president, or a disgusted  father who cringed at the Lewinsky scandal and wanted to distance himself?  This book clearly raises as many questions about Al Gore as it answers. All  the facts are here...born in Carthage, raised in two states, congressman,  senator, etc. But if you hope by the end of the book that you will truly  *know* Al Gore better than before, you might be a tad let down. <br />The  authors leave little doubt as to the intelligence and abilities of Al Gore  -- a qualified man, ready to be president.  THE PRINCE OF TENNESSEE is a  good read in this election year. Love him, hate him or undecided -- this  book is a very good biography that is fair and balanced.	2000-09-10

Thank you, Dr. Glenmullen for an excellent book that,hopefully, will open a lot of eyes to the dangers of psycotropic drugs.<br />This volume very clearly spells out the dangers of addiction and withdrawal with SSRI anti-depressants. This is a very easy-to-read book without a lot of medical jargon. You will read the stories of those affected by these medications, and weigh the pros and cons of starting the rollercoaster life of psychiatric drugs....<br />The message in &quot;Prozac Backlash&quot ... is that it is easy to become an &quot;accidental addict.&quot; I highly recommend Dr. Glenmullen's &quot;Prozac Backlash&quot; to anyone taking SSRI anti-depressants and have wondered why they feel even WORSE than before the prescription was placed in their hands. Also, those who try to stop these drugs and feel like you are going crazy - take heart, there IS a way out. This book is a good start.  END	2000-08-27

Of the hundreds of novels I have read in my years, THIS is the best. Period. While Maugham has been placed near the bottom of reading lists in literature classrooms, this  enduring masterpiece shows why that is a travesty. How many critics does it  take to say, \\"Maugham may have been the greatest storyteller  ever,\\" before people actually begin to READ him again?    \\"Of  Human Bondage\\" is the story of Philip Carey up until Carey is thirty.  You LIVE the life of Philip right along with him. The writing is so  riveting that as you conclude, you close the book and ask yourself,  \\"what am I going to do now\\"?  It is easy to experience  \\"Philip withdrawal\\" after finishing \\"Of Human Bondage.\\"  Don't let it last long though - catch more writing from the master, the  great William Somerset Maugham.    ***UPDATE***May 1, 2011***    Another decade of living and reading has passed. 'Of Human Bondage' is still my favorite book. No question. I just wish more people were reading Maugham and, especially, this greatest of novels.	2000-06-12

Having read and admired Steve Chandler's first two books, I was prepared for a lot of rehashing of the same material - which was okay as the first two were truly inspiring works. However, there's no recycling here.  &quot;17 Lies That Are Holding You Back &amp; the Truth That Will Set You  Free&quot; is truly a book of practical thoughts to help you quit fooling  yourself with self-inflicted falshoods and face life with a new attitude.  Mr. Chandler does not allow for excuses (too old, not enough education,  etc.) and he writes with an easy-to-read style that is without pretense.  This is a guy who hit bottom, fought his way back, and plainly tells you  how he managed to do it - and how you can too. This wasn't meant to be a  deep psychological tome -- It was meant to be practical. For example, most  &quot;self-help&quot; books are full of exercises that tell you that  &quot;you must stop right now and take this test,&quot; or &quot;write this  100 word essay,&quot; before you can go on. You will find none of this in  &quot;17 Lies.&quot; <br />Imagine sitting across a table with a man who has  hit rock bottom in his life, and between sips of coffee he tells you his  story and how he climbed back, and you batter him with questions which are  answered without psychobabble and in a humble, enlightening way. If you  listen carefully, you'll here truth that is simple, makes sense, and hear  many things to make your own life better, whatever your lot in life.  Imagine that litle scene and make it happen by spending a night or two with  Steve Chandler's &quot;17 Lies That Are Holding You Back &amp; the Truth  That Will Set You Free.&quot;	2000-05-31

Few know Hart the novelist. This book is an  excellent read concerning issues so vital put into a context of intrigue  and suspense. Also check out &quot;I, Che Guevera&quot; (using the  Blackthorn psuedo)and &quot;Strategies of Zeus&quot; written under his own  name - AND - &quot;The Double Man&quot; written with William Cohen. This  book again proves Hart was a man ahead of his time and had the potential  for great leadership - not to mention a great moonlighting job as a writer  of novels!	2000-05-10

Dyer's assertion that this came from &quot;automatic writing&quot; is a tad unbelievable. I am a Dyer Fan. Honestly, I enjoyed the earlier books such as YOU'LL SEE IT WHEN YOU  BELIEVE IT better than the &quot;new age&quot; titles of the past several  years; however I have gained from some of those as well. But this one?  Those of you who remember Dyer claiming the &quot;seashore&quot; story and  throwing the fish in as his own - like it happened to him - when, in fact,  it is an ages old story, will have reason to question the &quot;automatic  writing.&quot; There are SOME good things in this book - no doubt. There is  also no doubt though that Wayne Dyer has made a steady progression from  self-help to motivational to new age to the occult.....automatic writing?  Wayne Dyer is still worth reading, but much of it one must, if you listen  to his latest claims, take a lot of it with a grain of salt. Better  choices: The title I mentioned above or some of his great audio series ala  HOW TO BE A NO LIMIT PERSON.	2000-03-29

This book is a valuable resource for families to use when preserving the legacy of a loved one who is dying.

We have used the book as a guide  for a *very long* audio interview. I ask the questions from the book - she  reaches back and tells the stories. It has been a wonderful experience for  me and my mother in these days we know will be cut short due to her  illness. Preserve the legacy of your loved ones now - before it's too late!
