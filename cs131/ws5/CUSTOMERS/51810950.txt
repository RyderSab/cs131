There is code-breaking, symbolism, conspiracy and betrayal. Of course there are shades of Dan Brown, with more than a cursory nod to that populariser of the historical mystery, Umberto Eco, and his ur-text, &quot;The Name of the Rose.&quot; But what may be less well known is that &quot;The Rule of Four,&quot; is also a novel about the nature of friendship and the process of coming of age. It's a campus novel with (I bet) some autobiographical touches thrown in.  Along with the influences mentioned above, I would definitely add Donna Tartt's &quot;The Secret History.&quot;  So if you're looking for a good summer read that's not too demanding, reasonably well written and has a good plot to commend it, you cannot go wrong with this book.  However, if you do happen to read it, would you be good enough to explain what the title means?!!	2004-06-17
US	51810950	R2L97DP1O6GIKI	039331619X	210743552	Why the Allies Won	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A Masterpiece of Synthesis	In this very successful and widely praised book, written to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, Richard Overy has managed to synthesise a vast range of subjects and data into a relatively short and convincing account of why the Allies eventually won. The book is useful both to those new to the subject and to those who may too know too much about it and need something more analytical to tie things together. To describe the book in summary terms, Professor Overy identifies the critical points of the conflict (Stalingrad and Kursk, the war in the Atlantic, the bombing of Germany and the invasion of Normandy), and shows how the Allies prevailed in each, often by the skin of their teeth.  Overy rightly points out the centrality of Germany to most of the Allied participants in the war (according to Overy, the US spent 85% of its effort on Germany and only 15% on Japan and the numbers are even more lopsided for the USSR and Britain).  Long before Germany fell, the much more backward economy of Japan was in shambles and its fighting capabilities destroyed.  The famous American island battles against the Japanese used a fraction of the troops and weapons used against the Germans. Later, the author goes on to identify certain key themes and show how the Allies and Axis differed in their approaches to them - for example, in the organisation of industrial technology, the nature of political leadership, and the moral aspects of the war.  One comes away from the book sobered by just how great the expenditure in lives and treasure was on both sides, how the eventual outcome was far from being inevitable, and how mind-bogglingly large the scale of the conflict was. A fine work of scholarship and synthesis, and one that gives the reader a lot to think about.	2004-06-15

Massie, and have enjoyed all of his books (&quot;Nicholas and Alexandria&quot; and &quot;Dreadnought&quot; were my favourites).  This book shows all of the virtues of this very fine popular historian: fluent prose, well drawn individual portraits, absorbing anecdotes and skilful expositions of complex historical events. I particularly enjoyed his account of the naval campaign at Gallipoli,  and his description of the Battle of Jutland ranks in my opinion (along with John Keegan's Jutland piece from &quot;The Price of Admiralty) as the best short account of Jutland ever written. However, readers who are new to Massie should know what to expect: the book is written almost entirely from secondary sources and what he presents is an excellent synthesis rather than an original interpretation; there is little new here. Minor quibbles: I wish the coverage of the German side had been more thorough, and perhaps Massie could have covered the Graf Spee story in fewer pages.	2004-05-18

Benefiting from newly released archival information as well as interviews, memoirs and new research, &quot;The Court of the Red Tsar&quot; is well written and almost compulsively readable for people like myself who have have been both fascinated and repelled by this astonishing and terrible man. For me, it serves as a sort of compendium of all the stories and anecdotes one might hope to read about the bizarre menagerie of misfits, sycophants and sociopaths with whom Stalin seemed to feel most at home, all living (and often dying) together in an environment that would have seemed very familiar to Caligula himself.  And yet Stalin was no Caligula; he was horribly sane and chillingly far sighted, willing to wait years before striking down a perceived rival.  That he was so successful, and ruled for so long, is a sobering testament to the power of evil in statecraft and human relations.  Read this book for its unforgettable portrayal of the inner circle and their crimes, but don't expect too much by way of a broader historical context.  The author's focus is unabashedly local, and the book is much more like Suetonius than Gibbon.	2004-05-11

Rockefeller), and I am happy to say that I also enjoyed this latest work on one of the most enigmatic of the founders.  Good writing, extensive research and the ability to connect the complicated dots of an often secretive and complicated life into a coherent narrative make for an absorbing read.  Other authors (such as Richard Brookhiser)have already made the case for re-assessing Hamilton as one of the most influential of the founders, but Chernow's story is more fully fleshed out and both broader (in terms of the historical context) as well as narrower (in terms of the man's personal life) in scope.  Hamliton's achievements - the organisation of public finance, the contribution to the Federalist Papers, etc. are well treated, as are his rivalries with the other collossi - Jefferson the most prominent. The private life receives a judicious exposition, although Chernow can add little to that greatest of American mysteries, the cause of the duel between Hamilton and Burr (Gore Vidal's fictional account in his masterpiece &quot;Burr&quot; makes as much sense as any other theory!).  However, I will have to say that after finishing (and enjoying) this book, I did feel that it represents &quot;the Case for Hamilton&quot; rather than an even-handed account of his life and times.  As a keen (amateur) student of American history, I am frequently struck by how radically different the visions of an ideal republic really were when you compare the views of Hamilton with those of a Jefferson, or contrast them with the thinking of Adams or Madison. The modern world and America's current state are much closer to the spirit of Hamilton, and in that sense he really is one of the most important of the founders.  But was something lost as a result of this Hamiltonian &quot;victory&quot;? A great work of biography would have gone deeper into those questions, but you can't have everything, I suppose, or not often.  This is not Sandburg or Boswell, but it is a very fine book and well worth your time this summer!	2004-05-11

First, of all, let me advise all and sundry to rush out and get this book if they have not already done so. If it's lying at the bottom of your summer reading pile, promote it at once (those who have read the book and know chess will recognise the feeble pun). You're not likely to find a more engaging read among the new offerings of the year, and I would not be surprised if awards and other goodies are in the offing for this book. But having let loose on my enthusiasm, it is time to take a step back and look at &quot;Emperor&quot; with slightly more critical eyes. Two novels coexist uneasily in this book - a brilliant Trollopian social satire and a rather contrived mystery. One even wishes that Professor Davis had concentrated only on the former and left the latter to lesser talents. This wonderful journey through the worlds of law, academia, politics and upper class east coast society has no need for bloody murders and tortuous chess problems to enliven it. Caught in the spell of the narrative, the thriller bits (which have a tendency to show up in the last lines of chapters) seem almost like intrusions. And yet all criticisms aside, this is fine entertainment with more than its share of thought-provoking insights into life and human nature. Don't miss it!	2002-07-25

The uprising spread from one town to another and soon the entire island was in rebellion against its ruler, Charles of Anjou. Steven Runciman, one of the last stalwarts of the great Oxbridge school of history writing places this violent but seemingly local event in it proper context - as part of the struggle between the rising tide of the new force known as nationalism and the aspirations of the Popes and their religious establishment to create a universal Papacy ruling all of western Christendom. Toss in the age-old struggle between the spiritual authority of the Pope and the temporal authority of powerful rulers, and the result is an explosive mixture. The Sicilan Vespers marked the watershed in the fate of the medieval Papacy - as Runciman shows, the credibility and spiritual authority lost during the course of the last half of the 13th Century set the Church on the slippery slope that led to Avignon and eventually the Reformation. It is a stirring tale, and who better to tell it than the distinguished historian of Byzantium and the Crusades? New readers will soon discover why this book has become a classic.	2002-01-05

The novel was designed to be a condemnation of the conditions facing the working poor in the Paris of the Second Empire, and Zola's usual methods of intensive linguistic and sociological research are very much on display. But above all, &quot;L'Assommoir&quot; is a book of unfogettable portaits that transcends the specific moment in time when it was written and has captivated readers for nearly 130 years. Gervaise is a truly memorable creation, drawn with loving care; the city in which she lives, the Paris of Haussmanization, is just as vividly rendered; the supporting cast of Lantier the scoundrel, the doomed Coupeau, the admirable but odious Lorrilleux and all their fellows combine to form a whole that really does deserve the sadly degraded encomium of &quot;masterpiece.&quot; Read this one, and be captivated in turn!	2002-01-01

The editors draw extensively from the golden age of the 19th century and find plenty of gems from the 20th to back them up. Michael Cox's volume of detective stories is a typically enjoyable example, with six stories from the period 1892-1923 and six later examples, including the relatively modern offering from Julian Symons dating from 1986 (&quot;The Flaw&quot;, in which a man seeking to commit the perfect crime finds that he is not the only one with that objective in mind!). In my opinion, the newer stories in the collection are stronger (with the exception of &quot;The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk,&quot; a fine example of Sherlock Holmes at work). The tales by Dorothy L. Sayers, H.C. Bailey, E.C. Bentley and Michael Innes are quite spectacular.	2001-12-21

As with all Morse novels, the entertainment comes not so much from the plot as from the character of Morse himself and the strange personalities he comes across during the course of his investigations. The lover of crossword puzzles, Wagner, beautiful women, Scotch and Faure's Requiem makes brilliant deductions (often brilliantly wrong), but the faithful cricketer Sergeant Lewis is always there to set him back on the right course. Colin Dexter succeeds in making grammar interesting and has elevated the selection of chapter epigraphs to an art form! The thirteen Morse novels are a unique and enduring addition to the crime canon, and it is a remorseful day indeed when it comes time to say goodbye.	2001-12-16

Father Lorenzo Quart is sent by the papal curia to Seville to investigate this strange church, which apparently kills to defend itself.  Two men have died, and there is more death to come. Father Quart soon finds himself in a quagmire of religious fervour, financial skulduggery, blackmail, kidnapping, murder and yes - temptation in the person of a beautiful young duchess. All is resolved rather hastily in the end, but if the plot leaves something to be desired the journey turns out to be worth the effort. The author's tongue-in-cheek tone makes it clear that you're not meant to take anything too seriously, and his loving evocation of Seville, city of Carmen and manzanilla, is quite impressive. Although this is not one of Mr. Perez-Reverte's strongest efforts, &quot;The Seville Communion&quot; is a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.	2001-11-29

And revenge...<br />41 years after their last fateful meeting, two old friends eat dinner together in a Hungarian castle that is a relic of another age, when Vienna was the centre of Europe and young men waltzed with their girls to the hot new tunes of Strauss the younger. A world war has ended that age forever, and a second and even more terrible conflict has just begun. But for these two men, the world around them means little. Far more important is the reality of what happened four decades earlier, and whether a terrible act of betrayal took place. The author uses the devices of swift scene paintings and extensive monologue to expertly conduct the reader through the story, and the result is a truly unforgettable work of fiction. The translation by Carol Brown Janeway is admirable.	2001-11-18

We are given the great man's public life without any deep examination of the inner man.

We watch as Mr. Vidal hilariously demolishes a critic and marvel as he tears into John Updike. We learn that Thomas Mann was inspired by a Vidal novel to return to &quot;Felix Krull.&quot; But for most of the book, we are treated to Mr. Vidal's vehemently expressed political views (the military-industrial complex runs the country, the American polity is a single party state with two right wings - Democratic and Republican, the Federal government is a form of tyranny, the majority of Americans are worse of than their counterparts in other rich countries). Whether you agree or not, reading Vidal always has the salutary effect of making you revisit your assumptions. This reader certainly awaits more from Gore.	2001-11-15

To his contemporaries the task that Boswell had taken on was presumptuous indeed - to record the life of the greatest literary man of his age, while being dismissed himself as a frivolous and reprobate dilettante incapable of any serious activity. Well, the world knows that Bozzy succeeded in confounding his critics, but the tragic irony of his predicament was that he succeeded too well. While hailing the book as a masterpiece, the current and future literary establishment dismissed Boswell's own role as little more than that of a stenographer. Macaulay's damning essay on Boswell formed the opinion held by too many people for far too long. The true story of Boswell's genius became well known to scholars in the 20th century; with this book, Mr Sisman brings the story to a wider audience. It is a remarkable portait of Boswell's love for Johnson and the great struggles he endured to bring his hero to life in the pages of his biography. Battling drink, debauchery, depression and his own self-destructive nature, Boswell managed to pull off the one great sustained piece of effort of his life. In his book Johnson was brought to life once again, an image so convincing that it took over 150 years for people to discern the art behind the apparent ingenuousness of Boswell's technique. Sisman does a good job of showing how the Johnson of the Life was as much a product of Boswell's gift as the historical record (although I think readers would have benefited from a few examples of textual analysis to illustrate this). His final chapter on the gradual unearthing of the Boswell papers provides an exciting ending and his writing is clear and compelling. &quot;Boswell's Presumptuous Task&quot; is nothing short of a triumph.	2001-11-13

The author shares her memories of evenings and meals spent with Greene and her husband (the writer Francis Steegmuller, whose &quot;Flaubert in Egypt&quot; is one of the jewels of my book collection) on that exotic island, home to so many notable expatriates of yesteryear, Lenin and Norman Douglas among them. The book is interesting for its depiction of Greene in all his annoying lovability, although when you finish it (in little more than an hour) you might feel the need for more substantial fare. &quot;Greene on Capri&quot; probably won't be of interest to most people, but for diehard devotees of that difficult genius it makes for a worthwhile read.	2001-11-12

That book didn't quite work, with the author spending too much time on atmosphere and the characters and not enough time on the plot. After all, in my book you read a thriller for the plot - if you want great characters and atmosphere, read Flaubert or Bellow. With &quot;The Prodigal Spy,&quot; however, Mr. Kanon has definitely hit a home run. The characters are truly vivid, and the atmosphere of 1969 Prague is very well done indeed. But it is the plot that will stay in my mind, enthralling in its detail, complexity and surprises; all elements of the story are expertly balanced, making for a very enjoyable experience. This tale of a young man travelling behind the Iron Curtain to meet his long-lost defector father and then returning to the United States to uncover an even more important mole is worthy of comparison with le Carre, Greene and even Eric Ambler himself.

Like his distinguished predecessors, Wilson has created a thriller of ideas, peopled by characters of uncertain reliability acting out their dramas in obscure places. Alan Furst and Phillip Kerr have mined the same terrain with some success, but Robert Wilson has really pulled it off. The plot involves the efforts of a group of SS officers to secure their future through smuggling and theft during World War II, and the seemingly unrelated murder of a young girl in Lisbon in the 1990s. Bringing these events together is a nigthmarish tangle of murder, deception, betrayal, revenge and fiendish plot twists. Read on and enjoy!!	2001-11-08

Nearly a decade has passed since Garry Wills won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for &quot;Lincoln at Gettysburg,&quot; but the magnitude of his achievement is measured by the continued interest which book lovers have lavished on this thoughtful and debate-stirring work of history. Wills situates the Gettysburg Address in the Greek Revivalism exemplified by Edward Everrett (the forgotten featured speaker at the dedication of the Gettysburg cemetary), as well as in the Transcendentalist movement of Theodore Parker and Ralph Waldo Emerson. He goes on to demonstrate the inherant radicalism of Lincoln's 272 immortal words, imbued as they are with the dangerous notion that all men are created equal. Wills argues convincingly that the Gettysburg address hijacked the narrow readings of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution put forward by the southern rebels; through his words, Lincoln succeeded in placing these founding documents on the side of the angels by insisting that liberty and equality rather than sterile legalisms about states rights were the true basis of the grand experiment of the founders. In so doing, America's greatest President changed the history of the nation forever, influencing politics and policy right down to the present day. Huzzahs to Mr Wills for disinterring the radical hidden within the Great Compromiser!! And thanks to the prize committees for getting it right for a change.	2001-11-05

Its central theme - and the theme behind much of what Didion writes - is the atomisation of American culture, the way in which things have fallen apart and left millions adrift from the cultural and ethical moorings that their ancestors took for granted. 33 years later, it is ironic to look back on the period that the writer depicts with such grim pathos when it is celebrated as a time of idealism and freedom by the survivors of the sixties. Many pieces in the first and third sections of the book (&quot;Lifestyles in the Golden Land&quot; and &quot;Seven Places of the Mind&quot;) seem rather dated; the piece which made the most impression on this reviewer was the least ambitious of the group; to me, the portrait of Comrade Laski of the CPUSA-ML is a tiny masterpiece of irony. The pieces from the second section (&quot;Personals&quot;)were much more enjoyable, especially &quot;On Keeping a Notebook&quot; and &quot;On Self-Respect.&quot; Overall, &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot; is more memorable for the author's endearing prose style than for the individual essays.	2001-10-31

It represents the most comprehensive, well argued and carefully documented modern presentation of the case for viewing the Emperor Hirohito as an active &quot;war lord,&quot; differing from Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini only in the indirection of his operational style. The Showa Emperor was an enthusiastic participant in the politics, ideology and conquests of the war years, but he hid behind the myth and ritual of his ceremonially divine status, protected by a loyal coterie of court officials. The exigencies of the postwar occupation and the historical amnesia of subsequent generations in Japan and elsewhere enabled Hirohito to escape the consequences of his actions. Mr. Bix's fair but damning political biography makes an impressive attempt to redress the balance. My only serious complaint is that the paperback edition lacks a bibliography. Also, I could have done with a bit more background on the events of the Meiji restoration and the nature and practice of Shinto. But these quibbles do not stand in the way of a warm recommendation.	2001-09-27

In this marvellous recasting of the traditional English village mystery, Val McDermid has succeeded in creating a story that cries out for comparison with the masterpieces of the mystery genre. Indeed, one finds traces of many of the great ones embedded in the plot, reworked and refashioned in original ways to serve the narrative - Nicholas Blake's &quot;The Beast Must Die,&quot; Agatha Christie's &quot;Murder on the Orient Express,&quot; David Stout's &quot;Carolina Skeletons&quot; and Josephine Tey's &quot;The Franchise Affair&quot; are a few that come to mind. The tale of two policemen obsessed with the brutal murder of a 13-year-old girl and the journalist who revisits the crime 35 years later has everything for even the most demanding of mystery fans - ingenious plotting, expertly drawn atmosphere and absorbing characters. And behind it all is a truly chilling depiction of revenge, and the long-armed evil to which it is a response...a reminder that the evil that men do really does live after them.	2001-09-18

If Charles Dickens had been Brazilian, then he may have written &quot;Dona Flor.&quot; Of course, I mean the Dickens of &quot;Pickwick&quot; rather than &quot;Bleak House.&quot; Amado's lovingly imagined tale of an extraordinary woman's unlikely path to happiness has been read and enjoyed by generations of readers, and with good reason. It is a vast panorama of life in the town of Salvador de Bahia, with dozens of classic characters and a circuitous plot, all delivered with humour and panache. A hedonist's delight, &quot;Dona Flor&quot; is a celebration of love, sex, food, music, gambling and everything else that can make a person happy. Check your disbelief and social concerns at the door, sit back and enjoy Jorge Amado's feast for the senses.	2001-09-04

The book consists of short character sketches of six men (Beerbohm is the ever present seventh), and each one is a small masterpiece of Edwardian parody and humour. Beerbohm's line sketches of each one of his (imaginary?!) characters are included at the end of the book. Some of the tales have an unexpectedly supernatural twist (the neo-Faustian bargain struck by Enoch Soames being the best of the lot). Three cheers for the NYRB Press for bringing these forgotten gems back into print.	2001-08-24

Part crime thriller and partly a novel of railway life, it tells the story of a group of people who are slaves to their passions and whose ultimate doom is preordained by their backgrounds and temperaments. There are marvellous passages of descriptive writing and if you think that a novel about the railways is bound to be dull you will find yourself happily mistaken. The depiction of Jacques, genetically doomed to be a murderer, is more frightening than any Hannibal Lecter. Some modern readers may have difficulty empathising with Zola's ideological beliefs, but in the end the novel carries all before it. A shattering, truly memorable work of art, very well translated.	2001-08-22

The results are interesting without being particularly memorable. Halperin tells his stories in a plain documentary fashion, without much analysis and with none of the mordant wit or strong opinions of Strachey's nasty little classic. Such a straightforward approach works best if bolsered by extensive research, but the slim bibliography indicates a newspaper profile rather than an original and insightful work. All this being said, Bowen, Philby and Astor are interesting enough as people to making reading &quot;Eminent Georgians&quot; worthwhile. As for the good King George, it will take a much more persuasive writer to bring that admirable but dull monarch to life on the page.	2001-08-17

It's a tangled tale of love, adultery, deception, self-deception, jealousy and attempted suicide, all rendered with deadpan humour and with just enough darkness lurking behind the scenes to make it even more interesting. Many of Murdoch's novels have a central character cast as the master manipulator, but here it's never clear who is manipulating whom. The portrayal of the ponderous, rather smug protagonist is a masterpiece of sly character assassination and the immortal Honor Klein is...well, you'll have to read the book to find out.

Yes, the plot bears more than a passing resemblance to &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; and yes, the book is a little too long and drags a bit in the middle, but Stefanie Patrick is much too interesting a heroine and Burnell much too good a storyteller to let small quibbles get in the way of &quot;a crackling good yarn.&quot; The book is about how a drug-taking prostitute a few steps from her final fix is transformed into the dreaded Petra Reuter, unstoppable international assassin. There is plenty of sex and violence and a plethora of repulsive terrorists - in short, enough to keep the average thriller fan happily engaged for hours. I'm looking forward to Mr. Burnell's next foray with bated breath.	2001-08-11

Amid the tumult of the Thirty Years War, which would have have such a large impact on the future of Europe and indeed the entire world, an equally momentous change was taking place in the sciences. Alchemy and astrology still rule, but the natural sciences and astronomy are gradually coming into their own. Johannes Kepler builds on the insights of Copernicus and the observations of Tycho Brahe to create new theories of planetary motion that reinforce and are themselves strengthened by the work of Galileo. Banville has created a multi-dimensioned work, part picaresque, part epistolary novel, part flashback, in which Kepler struggles past politics, religious discord, family distractions and war to seek out the celestial harmonies that he is convinced are there for the discovering. &quot;Kepler&quot; is not the greatest of Banville's novels, but that still makes it a very good one indeed.	2001-08-10

Historian of the British Empire and Venice, intrepid world traveller whose books are always enriched by well judged doses of historical detail, she has a fine direct style and an eye for the unusual. &quot;Fifty Years of Europe&quot; is described as an album because it consists of dozens of short essays and fragments written over a period spanning World War II to the nineties. Morris tries to lend some coherence to this collage by grouping the entries under thematic headings, but it's hard to escape the feeling that the book is an attempt to patch together bits and pieces from various writer's notebooks kept over the years. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that, and Jan Morris is nothing if not a good raconteur, so the book provides plenty of browsing pleasure. Morris fans will enjoy it, but if you are a newcomer I would suggest that you start with her books on Oxford, Manhattan, Venice or (for history buffs) the magnificent Pax Britannica trilogy.	2001-08-09

It has been in print for nearly a generation, and with good reason. Chiang's achievement is to have created a learning programme that can take a modestly numerate person all the way from basic matrix algebra through limits, continuity and derivatives past simple differential equations all the way to optimisation theory and linear programming. And all in one volume! Little prior training is required for this journey - all you need is basic algebra. The explication is admirably clear, there are plenty of good practice examples and the pace is moderate. &quot;Mastering Chiang,&quot; as one of my old professors used to call it, provides an excellent foundation for the economics or finance student and will admirably equip him or her to deal with the more rigorous challenges ahead.	2001-08-09

This is one of the handful of classic texts in economics and finance - it ranks with Samuelson's &quot;Economics,&quot; Alpha C. Chiang's &quot;Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics&quot; and Hull's &quot;Options and Other Derivative Securities&quot; as one of the cornerstones of a financial education. Designed as a college textbook but also used in first-year MBA programmes, the authors begin right at the bottom with basic microeconomics and moves on through spot rates and yield curves, simple probability, expected returns and standard deviations. Once this basic toolkit has been establised, the reader is introduced to the efficient frontier and the Capital Asset Pricing Model, followed by arbitrage pricing theory. Further topics include fundamental securities analysis and a quick journey through option pricing. After a look at some institutional aspects of financial markets, the authors conclude with that holy grail of finance - portfolio management. Throughout, the pace is reasonable and the reader is provided with plenty of practice examples. For a one-stop introduction to finance, you cannot do better than this book.	2001-08-09

His book was especially timely in the case of Germany because he began writing it shortly after the unification of the Federal Republic and the GDR, when discussion of Germany's past was widespread both at home and abroad. Buruma is also well qualified to comment on Japan because he lived there for many years and speaks the language.<br />To summarise, the &quot;The Wages of Guilt&quot; finds that the German people, at least in the western part, have been more ready to come to terms with their war legacy than the Japanese. There are Nazi sympathizers and Holacaust deniers aplenty in Germany, but they seem to be confined to the fringes. In Japan, however, rightist elements remain powerful and the official line is to portray the war as an economically driven power struggle in which any excesses committed by the armed forces occurred in the heat of battle, thus denying any similarity to the behaviour of the Nazis. Moreover, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are viewed as atrocities on par with any act committed by the Axis powers; racism and a perverted scientific curiosity are among the motives attributed to America in its decisions to drop the bombs. Buruma explores the efforts to re-examine the war through the prism of German and Japanese reactions to Auschwitz, Hiroshima, Nanking, the war crimes trials, etc. and the result is a troubling and thought provoking meditation on the power of history and the psychology of escape. Check this one out, it's worth a look.	2001-08-09

Liungman's achievement is to create a comprehensive taxonomy for symbols that uses the most basic shapes as building blocks to create ascending chains of meaning. As such, it is an original work of scholarship rather than a gazetteer of common symbols. &quot;The Dictionary of Symbols&quot; is a gold mine of information for readers interested in graphic design or the &quot;semiotics,&quot; if I may be allowed to use the term, behind supposedly abstract shapes and designs. Did you ever wonder about the significance of the Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen logos or the three diamonds of the Mitsubishi symbol? Would world history have been different if the Nazi swastika had pointed the other way? These and many other questions of similar nature are knowledgeably and enjoyably explored in this very impressive book.	2001-08-07

It is impossible not to be drawn in to the lost world of le Roi Soleil when you have such a charming companion as your guide. There is an immediacy and sensitivity to her writing that establishes a bond with the reader as palpable today as it was in the 17th century. The Marquise knew everyone and saw practically everything of note in the France of her time, or knew somebody who had seen it. She was a fixture at court, the companion of la Rochefoucauld and Madame La Fayette, saw the plays of Racine and Corneille, and heard the music of Lully. You can read about the trial of Foucquet, the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and witness the terrible death of the odious Marquise de Brinvilliers. This Penguin Classics edition by the great Leonard Tancock features wonderful translations but could have done with a few more explanatory notes. And it should have been longer!	2001-08-05

David Fromkin tells the story of how the colonial re-adjustments made by England and France during World War I in anticipation of the demise of the Ottoman Empire were ultimately responsible for the continuing mess that is the modern Middle East. It is a story that has been told many times, but seldom with such eloquence and rarely with such a sure eye for the telling detail. Mr. Fromkin has the gift of explication and the ability to really see the big picture. From the fateful voyage of the German warships Goeben and Breslau to the violent death of Enver Pasha in the wilds of Central Asia, and from the fictions of TE Lawrence to the cynical accomodations of Sykes and Picot, the reader is conducted expertly through an incredible but factual story whose ending has yet to be determined. As he shows in other books such as &quot;In the Time of the Americans,&quot; Fromkin is a stern critic of the old colonial powers, and some readers may find his account of French and British politics and policies to be a little one-sided, but what really good book isn't? An amazing work of history - six stars!	2001-08-03

He begins his account with the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, whose accession to office as a result of the assassination of President McKinley must be regarded as one of the most significant accidents in history. The tension between TR's &quot;big stick&quot; internationalism and Woodrow Wilson's more idealistic version is vividly described, and Fromkin does an excellent job of showing how the ideas (and policies) of FDR, Truman and their generation were both indebted to and yet reactions against the ideas of the great scholar-President. America's reluctant path to the centre of the world stage is presented as a mixture of fait accompli, idealism and enlightened self interest. It is a great story, and Mr. Fromkin does it justice. Warmly recommended.	2001-08-03

All this being said, it is important to understand the book's weaknesses. There is relatively little depth in terms of analytics and if you want formulae you will have to look elsewhere.

As usual, the anthologists in this series comb through the 19th and early 20th centuries for their wares and the authors represented are both famous and obscure. The gruesomeness of the murder methods in &quot;An Illustration of Modern Science&quot; (1896) would meet with the approval of Hannibal Lecter himself, and Conan Doyle would be hard pressed to conjure up a more sinister portrait of London than the one we see in &quot;Fogbound&quot; (1903). As for the disquieting &quot;Portrait of a Murderer&quot; (1942), it leaves the reader with a completely new perspective on the meaning of fatherly love. I am a big fan of the Oxford Twelves series (I have them all) and heartily recommend this book as well.	2001-07-22

Unlike other GI's, he carried a camera along with his rifle. He processed his film in army helmets and hung the wet negatives to dry on the branches of trees. Later, he worked as a photographer with the occupation forces. His stark and arresting black and white images follow the course from the liberation of Germany through the occupation, reconstruction and eventual return to a tentative peace in 1949. This book provides unexpected insight, through the eyes of a sensitive and individualistic observer, into a crucial period in 20th century history. Many of the pictures are truly unforgettable - especially the moving portrait of a dead GI in the snow of the Ardennes forest (p.4-5), the view of the mountains from Hitler's retreat at the Berghof (p. 68-69) and the quirky, humorous shot of the soldier with German children at Tempelhof Airport (p. 188-189) which sums up in a single image the magnitude of the rapprochement between Americans and Germans. &quot;Entering Germany&quot; is a very impressive achievement, and is strongly recommended.	2001-07-14

In my opinion, Shaw's book belongs in the company of &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; &quot;A Farewell to Arms,&quot; &quot;The Naked and the Dead,&quot; and &quot;Catch-22.&quot; Hopefuly this new edition from Chicago will help to bring a forgotten classic of World War II before a new audience. Many war novels hover uneasily at the brink of sentimentality and melodrama, and many more simply fall in. But in this story about three young soldiers who are &quot;The Young Lions&quot; of the title, with their hopes, fears, loves and hatreds, Shaw's touch is deft and his clear, smooth prose leads the reader through an absorbing and tragic story that remains as fresh and moving today as it was when it first written over half a century ago.	2001-07-14

Strassler's edition of the famous Richard Crawley translation of Thucydides is a remarkable work, not only because of its intrinsic merit but also because it is quite simply unique. Mr. Strassler has provided the ultimate in critical apparatus, an exhaustive series of tools with which to understand and appreciate one of the great books of world civilisation. I have never seen anything like it. First of all, there is the index; if an index can be said to be a work of art, the Strassler index is a work of art in the way it organises and informs the text. Next there are the maps - dozens of them - not clumped together in the middle of the book or hidden away at the end, but strategically placed throughout the appropriate points in the text, right at the reader's fingertips when he or she needs them. The footnotes (yes footnotes, not those pesky and inconvenient endnotes!) would fill a small volume of their own and add immeasurably to one's understanding. And as if this were not enough, there are 11 appendices - short essays by prominent classical scholars on different aspects of the Greek world in the time of Thucydides, from &quot;Athenian Government&quot; and &quot;Trireme Warfare&quot; to &quot;Religious Festivals&quot; and &quot;Classical Greek Currency.&quot; As far as I am concerned, the only problem with Mr. Strassler's edition is that is has made me greedy for more of the same - a similar edition of the Mahabharata, say, or Gibbon!

As a person involved in dealing with these monsters on a daily basis, Hull lives on my desk and has been a constant source of reference. It is also widely used by others in the industry. If Wiener Processes and Ito's Lemma are part of your life, this book is the one to get! PS...the solutions manual is a very useful companion if you want to get full value out of the book, but I have always thought it unfair of textbook publishers to print separate solutions texts when the main work is so expensive in the first place.

Far too many financial textbooks confine themselves to theory without giving the student any guidelines on how to put what they have learned into practice - a startling omission in what is a pre-eminently practical field. Benninga has attempted to fill that gap, and he succeeds brilliantly. Using very clear language and a step-by-step approach, he teaches the reader how to actually construct for himself or herself a series of different financial models that are immediately applicable in the real world. There are sections on corporate finance (cash flow) models, basic portfolio models (CAPM applications) and a really good one on option pricing models that has saved my bacon on more than one occasion! Other sections cover topics such as fixed income and Excel/VBA issues. In conclusion, this is a very impressive text, complete with usable models on CD-ROM, that can take you from novice to mid-level quant in a few weeks!	2001-07-07

Frankly, I think this book works much better on its own and I would recommend Fabozzi's &quot;Handbook of Mortgage-Backed Securities&quot; instead as a general guide to the subject. The workbook confines itself to a limited number of topics but it covers these very well. Beginning with simple cash flow and yield calculations, the authors move on to provide guidance on (simple!) prepayment modelling, basic structuring, the yield curve and regulatory tests. The approach is attractively practical, and I think of this text as a useful secret weapon to have up one's sleeve.	2001-07-07

Of particular interest to this reviewer were the chapters on the new credit risk models such as CreditMetrics, KMV and their brethren. There are also some informative chapters on default and recovery analysis and credit migration. However, like so many financial books on the market these days, there is little guidance on the practical implementation of the various approaches described in the text.

Hodges, which provides definitions of some of the most important concepts and would stand quite well on its own. However, if you expect something more than generalities, you will be disappointed.

If the difference between pizzicato and pianissimo continues to elude you, then read on. Two aspects of this book are particularly appealing. The first is Libbey's style, which is free-flowing and chatty, conveying often difficult ideas with impressive clarity (the articles on counterpoint and fugue are cases in point). Secondly, I was impressed by his essay-style approach to his various musical subjects; unlike a musical dictionary, which would be content to stop at mere definition, Libbey's book provides background, explanations, examples and opinions that do much to round out the material in the reader's mind. An impressive work indeed!	2001-07-05

In &quot;Truman,&quot; he brilliantly portrayed the Everyman who found himself at the centre of the world stage and acquitted himself with more skill and grace than anyone thought possible. This book on Adams takes up the cause of the most misunderstood and neglected of the primary founders, obscured by the dazzle of his more flamboyant (and less scrupulous) bretheren. The book works best on the personal level, when it deals with people and their relationships. Mr. McCullough is to be congratulated for bringing the wonderful correspondence between John and Abigail to greater public attention. It is less successful on an intellectual level, in the realm of ideas where Adams made his most impressive contributions. The author seems more adept at telling a story than in conveying complex ideas, and a book on Adams can only be called incomplete if his intellectual contributions are given secondary importance in the narrative. This being said, &quot;John Adams&quot; is still a very enjoyable book and there is much to be learned from it. And David McCullough is a raconteur par excellence.	2001-07-05

An earlier reviewer has perceptively identified Lytton Strachey as a literary ancestor for the kind of historical works that Mitford wrote, and there is more than a little of the Mitford novels in them as well (&quot;Love in a Cold Climate,&quot; &quot;The Pursuit of Love.&quot; In my view, Madame de Pompadour was more enjoyably treated in the other Mitford biography &quot;The Sun King,&quot; which might have been a better choice as a New York Review of Books Classic. This book tends to get bogged down in details of geneology (lovingly  dwelt on by the aristocratic Mitford), decorating and dresses, and in the end one feels that the author does not quite convince her readers to like her famous subject as much as she does. Nevertheless, &quot;Madame de Pompadour&quot; is well worth a read if you are interested in the period. Mitford's &quot;Volatire in Love&quot; is a related work that might also be of interest.	2001-07-01

A few days ago I reluctantly turned in my tattered old copy for the new edition. In my opinion, only Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable and the Oxford Dictionary of Aphorisms can match Benet for sheer browsing pleasure. The most impressive thing about this reference is its amazing range - the literatures of many countries, history, philosophy, language, even science and politics. There are innumerable short biographies, articles on individual literary characters and many handy plot summaries. All in a well bound paperback that can be read lying down! I also have a fatal weakness for the Oxford Companions, but if you are looking for a single volume guide to the literary world, look no further than Benet.	2001-06-28

Lewis wrote this famous book (dedicated to his brother C.S.) in 1953, but it has stood the test of time very well and provides an excellent introduction to the history of France during the reign of Louis XIV. &quot;The Splendid Century&quot; is history in the grand manner, written in the style of Trevelyan, Runciman and Roy Porter. The erudition is everywhere apparent, but it is worn lightly and the story is told in fluent prose enlivened by the odd flash of sly humour.<br />As the author points out in the introduction, the book might have been better titled &quot;Some Aspects of Life in the Reign of Louis XIV;&quot; rather than present a sequential narrative, Lewis chose to structure the book as a series of essays on particular aspects. There are chapters on the king and his court, the religious situation, the organisation of the army and the state of the peasantry. Among the unexpected pleasures of the book are the chapters on sea voyages, the world of the galleys and the education of women. A surprising omission, however, is a discussion of Colbert and his attempts at administrative reform. Nevertheless, this is a fine work of history that can be strongly recommended.	2001-06-25

The first sketch, &quot;Sebastopol in December&quot; was published anonymously and attracted the attention of Tsar Alexander II and Turgenev. It is a short, emotionally patriotic piece recording the author's empathetic reaction to the bravery of the ordinary soldiers and sailors during the siege. &quot;Sebastopol in May&quot; is more ambitious and more ambiguous, recording the experiences of a group of Russian officers during an attack by the Allies on the 4th bastion of the defences, a position dreaded by everyone on the Russian side. There are no heroes in this piece, says Tolstoy, except &quot;truth,&quot; as he depicts flawed human beings struggle to reconcile their petty vanities with the &quot;higher&quot; duties that have brought them to that terrible place. The final sketch, &quot;Sebastopol in August,&quot; records the fall of Sebastopol through the eyes of the doomed Kozeltsov brothers and features some of the finest battle descriptions I have ever read. Tolstoy published it openly under his own name, and it seems to have helped him finally to choose literature rather than the army for his future career. &quot;The Sebastopol Sketches&quot; is a marvellous book not only for its own merits but also for the insight it gives us into a literary master trying out his wings for the first time.	2001-06-21

Through these Bech stories, Updike takes a satirical look at the the Manhattan literary scene, pokes fun at the absurdities of the big city life and even takes a moment or two to ponder the Eternal Verities (but not too seriously). As his life enters its last phase, Bech finds himself in some interesting new situations: president of the The Forty, an intellectual society hopefully modelled on the French Academy but without its sense of self importance; as a caped avenger &quot;ridding literary Gotham of villains&quot; (read critics); as a septuagenarian father. Through all this absurdist comedy, the old Updike magic is constantly with us. Bravo!	2001-06-17

Some of the stories in this book, like Conan Doyle's &quot;The Story of the Man with the Watches&quot; are conventional mysteries, but in many of the others the mystery is never fully explained and the reader is left with &quot;a lurking sense of unease.&quot; The Victorian settings are cosily familiar and yet disquieting -  the fog, hansom cabs, madness and ghosts. Prepare yourself for a real treat as you ponder the unknown in &quot;Paul Vargas: A Mystery,&quot; witness a chess rivalry from beyond the grave in &quot;The Horror of the Automaton,&quot; or tremble at the terrible secret of &quot;The Yellow Box.&quot;  As for &quot;The Man with the Ebony Crutches,&quot; I would certainly not like to run into him on a dark and stormy night!	2001-06-16

In this wonderful book we are given a window into some fascinating lives, some famous and others forgotten, in a style that is elegant and yet simple. No authorial pyrotechnics are allowed to get in the way between the reader and the stories. The subjects range from E.M. Forster's guide book on Alexandria, Lord Byron's personal finances and Colette's third and happiest marriage to the family relationships that lay behind Samuel Butler's &quot;The Way of All Flesh.&quot; I hope other readers will find &quot;The Outermost Dream&quot; as enjoyable as I did.	2001-06-16

Most of the stories come from the Victorian and pre-WWII eras, although there are some exceptions. The series is also notable because the editors have made a special effort to find interesting stories by lesser known writers and the more obscure (but almost always entertaining) tales of the usual suspects such as Bram Stoker, Poe, J. Sheridan le Fanu, Conan Doyle and F. Marion Crawford. The collection under review is a great deal of fun despite the odd clunker and one or two of the stories is exceptional (Gerald Durrell, of all people, is represented by &quot;The Entrance&quot; which I regard as a small masterpiece). Those in search of more thorough coverage of the genre are referred to &quot;The Oxford Book of Gothic Tales,&quot; edited by Chris Baldick.	2001-06-14

Barzun compares the modern era to the glorious past, and like so many before him, he finds it wanting.<br />The author invites you to become an intellectual tourist as he surveys the highlights of the last five centuries. The terrain is familiar, but the perspective is individual, the interpretations often quirky and you are always challenged to re-examine your assumptions. Two unusual features of Barzun's book are the quotations in bold type that are scattered around the text to illustrate his points and his recommendations of books to read on topics of special interest. The latter serves as a sort of eccentric bibliography in miniature, and has furnished this reviewer with many happy ideas for future reading.<br />The most provocative remarks are reserved for the last part of the book, which provides a long list of what the author feels is wrong with western society at the end of the millenium. Some of these are the usual complaints of the fastidious conservative, while others are harder to dismiss. Readers will have to decide for themselves where they stand on these issues, and whether they agree with Mr. Barzun that &quot;Western Civ.&quot; is going down the tubes. But it's a fascinating journey, and Jacques Barzun is a wonderful guide.	2001-06-13

This one likes rich old women, who are brutally slaughtered with knives. The case is personal for NYPD sergeant Kathleen Mallory, because her foster father was on the trail of the killer before her and has ended up as one of the victims.  Mallory decides to follow the money trail, and is soon tangled up in a web of SEC investigations, insider trading and a large and formidable spirit guide.<br />&quot;Mallory's Oracle&quot; is fairly enjoyable but rather too long in the end, and the solution to the mystery is reminiscent of Agatha Christie's &quot;The ABC Murders.&quot; Its main interest lies in its engaging protagonist. Kathleen Mallory is beautiful, brilliant, an expert with computers and a crack shot, but despite being one step short of Wonder Woman she does have a few blind spots that make for some exciting action. This reviewer will certainly check out a few more of these comic book style super hero thrillers.	2001-06-11

Several young boys have been seen there over the years, and some have disappeared.  Detective Superintendent Parker has spent five years looking for young Joseph Coyne, and when yet another boy goes missing the investigation leads the policeman to the Bird Yard. Neither he nor Murray Hanson, a consulting criminal psychologist, are prepared for what lies ahead...<br />Urban decay and the Hitchcockian flutter of the birds in the aviary form the background to a tale of paedophilia and ritual murder that doesn't quite reach the levels of Julia Wallis Martin's moody masterpiece, &quot;A Likeness in Stone.&quot; The tension leaks away through inaction and the investigative aspects are not very intriguing; the subplot involving the psychologist dealing with his own personal demons seems contrived, and the ending is predictable. Overall, the book would have worked better if it had been about sixty or seventy pages shorter. Nevertheless, even in this less successful work Ms Martin rises well above the herd and her work will bear watching in the future.	2001-06-06

Only Albert Campion, faintly redolent of the early Lord Peter Wimsey with his fatuous smile and episcopal connections, stands between the criminal and a particularly nasty victory.  This is Golden Age crime in full glory: an extremely ingenious puzzle, very well drawn period characters (Great Aunt Caroline is unforgettable), the usual understated English humour and a villain who is memorable in more than the usual ways. I'm not sure if Margery Allingham ever wrote a better book than this, so sit back, relax, make yourself comfortable and get ready to enjoy a mystery the likes of which they seldom write these days.

Amid a plague of frogs and the threat of a terrible cholera epidemic, a young girl named Gustine leads a precarious life as a potter by day and a prostitute by night. Desperate for money and anxious to save her sick baby, she has the misfortune to come across a young surgeon who has fled Edinburgh after his involvement with a pair of gentlemen named Burke and Hare. What follows is a turgid melodrama of body snatching, Chartism and revenge that is unsatisfying as a thriller for want of plot and disappointing as a more serious work of fiction. <br />Ms Holman does a fair job of conjuring up the terrible conditions under which the urban proleteriat lived during the Industrial Revolution, and she also has some interesting things to say about the moral dilemmas inherant in the medical research of the time and by implication of today as well. But in the end, &quot;The Dress Lodger&quot; is a disappointment.  The authorial voice is an uncomfortable blend of modern prose and Victorian construction speckled with anachronisms and the odd incongruous Americanism, falling well short of the standards for historical pastiche set by the likes of Anthony Burgess and Umberto Eco. As for the larger themes, in his brilliant &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost,&quot; Iain Pears does a much better job of describing the strange world of pre-modern medicine, and when it comes to documenting the life of the urban poor, who can beat Charles Dickens in &quot;Bleak House&quot;?	2001-05-27

A young woman and a married man, teachers at the school of which his father was principal, had fallen in love. It was an era in which a woman could be sent to prison for the crime of adultery, and the beautiful Miss Channing, strong willed, cultivated and empathetic, did not easily fit in to a town and a school where conventions are not lightly flouted. The teenaged Henry Griswald, chafing with adolescent angst against what he perceives to be the repressiveness of his life and the society in which he lives, projects his own romantic longings on the doomed couple. What results is a tragedy of errors in which revenge, madness and murder are the inevitable result. The point of this novel is not the plot, which is simple and I would venture to say deliberately predictable, but the gradual revelation of character in the main actors in the drama. An impressive performance that richly deserves the Edgar for Best Novel.	2001-05-26

The reader is led through an increasingly confusing maze of mystery and misdirection that is a triumph of intricate plotting.

Darkly atmospheric, with intriguing characters and a particularly repulsive murderer, &quot;A Likeness In Stone&quot; is reminiscent of such Ruth Rendell masterpieces as &quot;The Lake of Darkness&quot; and &quot;A Judgement in Stone.&quot;  In my opinion, comparisons to Minette Walters do Julia Wallis Martin a disservice because Ms Walters will never be able to create the kind of creeping horror that Martin makes the reader feel in this novel.

This collection, which contains some of his best, provides a fine introduction to the dark vision of the late Victorian master. The title story is uncharacteristically happy, a pastoral piece in which Hardy tells a comic tale about a young woman's unexpected talent for criminal activity.  The other stories are much more representative, being concerned with the perils of love, the cruelty of convention and the tragic vulnerability of human aspirations to the whims of fate. Many of the tales are also wrapped in the Gothic and even grotesque trappings that Hardy seemed to favour when the mood was upon him. This collection gives Bram Stoker and Stephen King a run for their money, featuring a corpse with a stake driven through its heart, a new bride spending her wedding night with her new husband by her side and the corpse of her first husband in the next room, parricide, suicide and kidnapping. The mood of the pieces varies from the sunny high jinks of &quot;The Distracted Preacher&quot; to the wrenching tragedy of &quot;A Son's Veto&quot; and the relentless horror of &quot;The Withered Arm.&quot; Overall, this group of tales gives the newcomer to Hardy an excellent introduction to his talents as a storyteller, and fans of his novels will enjoy the opportunity to see the master at work on a smaller stage.	2000-12-28

To him, Britain was the land of liberty, of the rule of law and of moderation in religion and politics. Kaiser Wilhelm II would have disagreed vehemently. Despite his pride in the Order of the Garter and his position as colonel-in-chief of a Highland regiment, the ruler of the Second Reich saw Britain in similar terms as Napoleon had done, as a nation of crass materialism, lacking elan and vitality, cynically manipulating world events to keep Europe and Germany divided and weak. In this wonderful book, Ian Buruma examines the wide range of responses to Britain among Europeans through the stories of his Anglomanes - both 'phobes and 'philes - as well as from the perspective of his own family.  The result is a fascinating mixture of memoir, biography and history, filled with unforgettable characters including Alexander Herzen, Karl Marx, Garibaldi, Isaiah Berlin, and Buruma's own grandparents. Towards the end, the author raises uncomfortable questions about the current state of affairs in Britain. Was Isaiah Berlin indeed the &quot;Last Englishman,&quot; and is the &quot;fabled land of common sense, fairness and good manners&quot; a thing of the past?	2000-12-25
