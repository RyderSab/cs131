Be warned this is NOT for the young.  I go through books like crazy and picked this up because I thought it was going to be a muder/mystery type.  None of that happened until the last pages.   Meet Jake.  Jake makes all the ladies heads turn... and then some.  At first you think he is a physco.  His life revolves around sex.  Enter Mimi.  A classier type woman he is attracted to.  Mimi is engaged to be married but her sex life is lacking.  So Jake lets her watch how he suduces women.  Mimi sits in closets spying while extremely aroused.  This drags on and on, with drawn out chapters of how Jake suduces different women and Mimi hides and watches. How Jake nearly tortures women into pleasure.  Makes you wonder if thats all the writer Frank Baldwin thinks about, there is over kill here. There are added, non essential chapters, bits and pieces of Jakes life, how he lost his parents, how he bartendered at too young an age for his WW II vet grandfather and war buddies of old, that you discover later have nothing at all to do with the story line.  Just filler.   Then finally you get to a semi interesting story, literally at the last pages.  Women Jake has suduced turn up missing.  When finally Mimi, who now wants a part of Jake herself and is ready to give into him,  goes missing too.  Without giving too much away, there is always a hero in the end.  <BR>   There are much better reads out there, this was  more of an erotic romance novel, that sappy stuff I hate.  But this was grossly sexual, more than the classic \\"knight in shining armor\\" romance.  It barly kicks into any gear until literally the last 2-3 short chapters and you can figure it all out for yourself.  There are a very slight few creative twists, but it truly isnt worth weeding through for.  I say skip it, or if you have nothing else to read and you can borrow it off of someone, give it a shot, but dont waste your money on it, thats for sure.	2002-12-10

I was excited when I found this book, not only because I had watched Saturday night live for as long as I can remember, but I was eager to learn what went on behind the scenes.  And I received more than I bargained for, in all good ways.  The great thing about this book is it is told by the cast, writers, producers, and NBC executives.  It is from their mouths.  It isnt rumored tales or reporters speculating.  Of course there are different opinions and feelings, but for the most part, all the cast members seem to have the same feelings.  They feel a brotherhood to eachother. When you watch the show, and see the sketches, one believes these people are just having a grand old time, and you dont realize how much is involved until you read this.  It starts back in 75 with the original cast members, those who are still alive, talking about what it was like.  Drugs involved, pressures, etc.  It goes over deaths of Gilda Radner, Jon Belushi, Phil Hartman and Chris Farrley.  Almost all the cast memebers ever on the show speak in this book, with the exception of Eddie Murphy who, for some reason doesnt want to be any part of Saturday night live, even though thats what made him.  For most of the cast members SNL was their platform to stardom.  There also is alot of bitterness present, as with Janeane Garafalo.  Most of all the cast members and the writers feel pretty much the same about Lorne Michaels, the exucutive producer.  He is the creator and the father figure.  They all greatly seek his approval, which is scarce.  But most look back at him in kindness.  <BR> It is a great read, soooooo much information you would never have known otherwise.  I really thought this would be one of those books that would last me a while and I looked forward to that, but because you know so many of the cast and are so interested in the words from their own mouth, you really cant put it down.  Dont pass this one by!!	2002-12-04

A good, quick read if you are interested in forensics.  Be aware there is a very different approach to this book then any other forensic book I have ever read, and I have read alot of them.  Dr. Lee gives you the dynamics of each case in point.  The cases are Sacco-Vanzetti (from the 1920's), the Lindbergh baby, Sam Sheppard (the story that spawned the movie &quot;the Fugitive&quot; and the TV series by the same name), President Kennedy, Vincent Foster, Jon Bennet Ramsey, and OJ Simpson.  Here is the twist.  He travels back in time to sit through these trials, not to decide if the verdict is correct, but to see how immature our justice system was (or is... Simpson trial).  He shows how prejudices, crime scenes and evidence flawed the cases.  He talks about conspiracies, planting incriminating evidence, bumbling crimes scenes, and more.  It gets better.  Not only does he travel back in time, even back just 8 years (1994 OJ Simpson), but even to trials he was present at(Again, OJ Simpson where he was hired by the defence).  Which is not to say is a bad thing.. BUT, he has a buddy that he runs into when he goes back in time.  This is where I was ambivilent.  I could not decide if it was clever or unnecessary.  This 'buddy' was Sam Constant.  And although Dr. Lee was always unseen, Sam Constant could be seen to people at will.  Sam represented public opinion of the times.  He showed prejudices and followed medias.  Whatever was the publics main thought, such was his.  <BR>     The largest sections of this book was of Sacco-Vanzetti and OJ Simpson.  Very small sections on the others, which was the main reson for me to get this book in the first place.  It certainly was not a poor read, and Dr. Lee, who just sticks to his science and does not judge, is a very intelligent man.  His insights are very interesting, which thankfully were present and made the book worth the read for me.  I suppose you will have to decide for yourself.	2002-11-25

I picked up this book for lack of there being any better subjects at the time.  I was surprised that it wasnt as backstabbing and harsh as the other books I have read in this category.  It had more dealing with leading roles and top billing then the usual sex and drugs in other reads.  Also it is for all ages and doesnt deal with the teen pop there is today, asother books tend to zero in on.<BR>From the foursome of I love Lucy, Sonny and Cher, Bette Davis vs. Joan crawford to Boris Carloff vs. Bela Lugosi, Natalie Wood, Jackie and Joan Collins.  Theres a bit on Julia and Eric Roberts, and Michael Jackson, probably the youngest in the group.  It is all very interesting with stories more believeable than other books, alot of the context comes from true interviews with the author himself.<BR>     It isnt a book i would reccommend running out to buy immediately, but if it is there and you have nothing better to read at the moment, try it.  It is just the same as watching an old version of entertainment tonight.	2002-11-15

I believe in order to really enjoy this one has to possess a cattiness. It is relentless, and at times really harsh. A little too much information. You are left thinking, oh you poor soul, this is now exposed to the world. There are some super moronic things in here and you have to wonder exactly how much of it is true. Some things you already know, such as Sean Penn's violent behavior, some things will come as a surprise, such as Joan Crawford and her \\"rumored\\" female affairs and some things are just better left unsaid that leave a bad taste in your mouth,such as the \\"presents\\" Bette Midler left under each seat at one of her concerts. One tends to know the less intelligent actors and actresses (Melanie Griffith, Pamela Anderson, etc.) But this deleves a little more into other such things, beside stupidity. Be warned, it is not for the young, it is dirty, lots of sex and drugs and you even have a fully top exposed picture of Sophia Loren that I really could have lived without seeing. There are much better reads out there, after you finish this book you will feel a bit malicious and despiteful for having read it.	2002-11-06

For all the interviews I have seen or read of Jamie-Lynn Sigler, I have thought her innoccent, kind and concerned. After reading this book it all still stands true. She seems sincere, sweet, and loyal to her fans. As the on screen daughter of Tony Soprano she was thrusted into the lime light and had not only the pressures of any average teen, but a teen on a hit series. She is insecure and takes everything to heart. In this book she basically speaks to the teenage girls. She gives advice on relationships, friends and eatting disorders. She wears her heart on her sleeve as she talks about what she went through to overcome her eatting disorder and her battle with lyme disease. Although it is a good book, it is very young, as is she. Not that this is a stab at her, I do admire her and think she is a gifted actress, I would love to see her be the next \\"American sweetheart\\" especailly with the personality she possesses. But this again is geared toward teenagers, with information such as; \\"dont let yourself get so caught up in a boy that you lose yourself, like if you break up, you will never get over it, that is like so not true\\" as an example. For a teen it is perfect and she makes a fabulous role model. To end the book, she has great resorces for centers of eatting disorders all over the country, complete with addresses and phone numbers. Eatting disorders can be a problem for anyone at any age. But again, this is for the younger crowd, I would say 21 and younger, anyone older with eatting disorders can find better reads. But Jamie did well and should be proud. Im sure there will be many a teenage girl who will feel better after reading her book.	2002-11-06

For almost all the \\"rockers\\" drugs are mentioned.  Moser and Crawford have an array of musicians from Spinal tap to madonna and list  birth dates, places of birth, some hit songs and films if applicable, dumb quotes and idiotic things they have done.  I have to wonder about the authenticity of alot of the things, but then again money can be poison.  It isnt a book for teens there is alot of sex, violence and drugs.  It can be interesting, albeit embarassing for those listed.  If there isnt a thing better to read, give it a whirl.	2002-10-29

The power behind this narritive is amazing, the lyrical poetry magical. It is a story of mothers and daughters, the ambivalent love that waxes and wanes. Fitch is an amazing story teller able to capture ones attention and hold it, from start to 446 page finish. <BR> The tale that spun from Fitches mind, no true story here, starts with a 12 year old Astrid, daughter of Ingrid Magnussen, a merciless poet living a very bohemian life. Astrid's love for her mother is as deep as Ingrids love for her daughter is seemingly flighty. Ingrid has no tolerance of the weak and can not stand to lose. Ingrid becomes undone by an affair she never wished to have to begin with. The consequences Astird pays for. Thus spins the tale of Astirds horrid life with an array of foster mothers/ families for the next 6 years. It is horribly depressing, yet you find yourself hoping Astrid does not succum to the masses and lose herself.<BR> The description here is flabergasting. Long after this novel is through, you will find yourself still hypnotized by the writing alone and the story will remain scortched in your memory.	2002-10-25

Him and some buddies were sitting around talking about classic TV shows and when they went bad.  With &quot;Happy Days&quot; a friend and Jon agreed it was when Fonzie jumped the shark in the three part Hollywood episodes.  Thus the phrase &quot;Jump the shark&quot; was born.  This book goes through hundreds upon hundreds of TV shows, politicians, celebrities, music and sports and Jon pin points when the individual or individuals in question &quot;jumped the shark&quot; or took a turn for the worse so to speak and were not what they once were in our eyes.  Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion of course and you may find yourself disagreeing at some points. (I personally dont believe &quot;Happy Days&quot; ever jumped the shark, I was stuck on it from beginging to end).  More often then not, you will snicker to yourself because you agree 100% with Jon.  To add to this books pleasure it contains black and white pictures galore and small sidelined facts and fun stats on each page pretaining to the subject.  Truly a fun book to read.  There is no bashing here and credit is given where credit is due.  Check out the web site as well for continous fun. For now, Jon is not even close to jumping the shark.	2002-10-18

Coming to us from German journalists, I thought I was going to read about thing s I have read thousands of times.  I was mistaken.  This was on a much more personal level, with a few individuals you wouldnt know or have ever heard about and their horrifing ordeals.  You also get alot of information about the hijackers and their ways of life.  I found that I had a hard time reading these parts, as it angered me.  Hence Mohamad Atta's full last will and testament.  That nearly made me vomitt.  I dont even think I made it through the whole thing.  You learn alot in this book and it is also very graphicly descriptive.  As with most everything readable about September 11, it is heart wrenching and leaves you still not being able to imagine that this really occurrred.  But the information on what the hijackers practiced, how they were learned, how they ignorantly felt towards America, truly makes you proud to be an American and thankful for freedom.	2002-10-18

The story line is fantastic and the chapters end leaving you fiending for more.  <BR>     You start with a retired FBI agent trying to recapture his life.  By odd circumstance, which you have to read to find out,  he returns to the job to find a murderer who he belives is a cerial killer.  In true action hero form, he uncovers clues that the cops working on the case coulnd't figure out for themselves.  It becomes VERY personal for this retired FBI agent and Bloodwork has double meaning here, which makes the writting superb. The twists and turns enable you to practically read it from cover to cover in one sitting, utterly unable to wait for the outcome.<BR>     Michael Connelly knows how to grab and hold ones attention.  This book comes highly reccommended, especially if you like these FBI case stories.  Happy reading!	2002-10-18

Greg Manning stood by his wife Lauren's side as she was an innocent victim of September 11th.  Lauren was entering the WTC as a fireball of jet fuel engulfed her, pushing her out of the building, thereby saving her life, but not before it burned her 82.5%.  Usually the survival rate is very low the higher percentage of the burn.  Greg Manning, continued to raise their child Tyler and never let a day (90 total) go by the he was not at the hospital.  This is a book of e mails Greg sent to his friends and family from almost start to finish about the tragedy and Laurens progress. He hardly misses a day from September 19th until December 18, 2001.  Laurens strength is inspiring.  Gregs love is heartfelt.  He never lost faith, signing every e mail no matter what Laurens condition was at the time, Love, Greg and Lauren.  A good read.	2002-09-29

I opened this book and closed it within a day, finito.  Not having seen the movie, the book was a great read.  It was so sad to learn about these young girls, who are already struggling with adolecence, being in this home away from family and friends made to contend with their individual disorders.  The scary thing is many things they were feeling, each of us has felt at some time, though many of us arent self destrcutive and I suppose that is the difference.  The book was surprisingly humorous at times as well, and Susanna Kaysen took a big risk to expose herself and as you go on you learn she has come a long way.  She is solid and very likable.  Dont pass this by.	2002-09-19

This book is like all the other unauthorized Ozzy books, with slight variation.  If you are interested in reading about Ozzy, try &quot;Ozzy in his own words&quot;, at least it is more accurate and truthful, not hearsay and taken from context in interviews.  Dont get me wrong, this wasn't particularly a bad read, just a been there, done that type thing.  It is VERY similiar to Sue Crawfords book, except this was a bit more &quot;fun&quot;, meaning it has fact pages of each family member, it has quotes, it has quizzes, make for a little more interesting of a read if you are going to read the same stuff you have read before.  This book happens to have more information on &quot;The Osbornes&quot; the MTV smash hit than Sue Crawfords book too.	2002-09-17

I first saw the film of this as a child and while viewing it I remember being surprised that my mother let me watch it, considering I was a HUGE animal lover and for an animated film about wild rabbits there was a good amount of gore and she wouldnt let me see Bambi or Dumbo because she knew how upset I would be over it.  But years later when I was in my teens and I read the book \\"watership down\\"  I realize she let me see it because it was true to nature, with a fictional aspect.  The animated film was so memorable to me.  The book is even more memorible.  This is one of those books that you have on a book shelf and you read it again and again over the years because it is so well written.  In the years to follow after seeing the film I have had numerous rabbits and they have all been named after the characters from Watership down.  Basically this story is what Mr. Adams would percieve the life of a wild rabbit, threated by other animals, commercial building, traffic etc.  bringing life and realism to the hares.  It is a wonderful read.	2002-09-14

It is very British..meaning if you are not familiar with british slang and geography, you are better off renting the movie.  <BR>     Everyone has a Bridget Jones in their lives.. someone who is neurotic, insecure and compulsive.  So it is easy to relate to her and you will find your self rooting for her to succeed.  It has a handful of good laughs and it is written well.  Personally I would rather read a book that makes you turn the pages and  cant wait to see how it ends.  This is not one of them.	2002-09-13

Well, never being a true fan of Ozzy himself, yet enjoying his unique voice and solo music, I got this book to pass the time.  That was all it was, a time passer.  Being an animal lover I was disturbed about his antics of biting doves and bats heads off, but catching a few episodes of MTVs \\"The Osbornes\\" I liked the way he was and what he put up with with his own cats and dogs.  I.E. cleaning up after them, walking them and showing genuine affection.  But throwing animal insides back and forth at concerts, shooting every last one of his chickens, stabbing his aunt's cat... didn't settle well with me.  Of course his drug and drink stupors are obvious and well known.  But this was UNAUTHORIZED, and most of the authors words are either hearsay or from interviews she has seen of Ozzy.  Maybe I will try the 'Ozzy in his own words' bio and take his own word for it.  There wasnt anything else new to learn, same stuff that has been around for decades.  The one great thing about this book is it has a listing of all of his recordings, films and even all of his tatoos.  Why there is a big astronomy chapter of sagittaris and how it relates to Ozzy is beyond me, I couldnt even finish that chapter, it was so ridiculous.  I think she should have left it at the simple fact that he was born in December and a sagittaris.  But the book is OK if you have nothing better to read.	2002-09-13

Im more into bios and true crime, but as soon as I opened it, I basically read it straight through, when I had to put it down, I couldnt wait to get back to it right away. It isnt your typical kidnapping story. The entire book which was originally titled \\"24 hours\\" is set in exactly that; 24 hours. The chapters end in the way great authors keep you reading, yearning to find out what happens next. The characters; the \\"good guys\\" are likeable and easy to relate to. The \\"bad guys\\" or the leader at least, is scary enough to be true to life, real. Although you cant help feeling bad for one of guys on the \\"bad\\" team, ...you have to read it to find out, cant give too much away. Basically if you are looking for a good read, this is it. Take my word for it, it wont last long because you really wont be able to put it down, and read it before the movie, I always thought the books were alot better then the movies, your mind will add imagination to it all. But as far as fictional crime goes, this is the way to go.	2002-09-11

Dr Suess was way before his time when he wrote \\"The Grinch that stole Christmas\\".  The most unbelievable part for me growing up was the true meaning of christmas.  My first viewing of it on TV and reading it, I was awe struck by the line ...\\" it came without ribbons, it came without tags, it came without packages, boxes or bags\\"  and he puzzeled three hours 'till his puzzler was sore, then the grinch thought of something he hadn't before. \\"Maybe Christmas\\" he thought \\"doesnt come from a store.  Maybe Christmas.. perhaps.. means a little bit more\\".  <BR>     In the world we live in today where we are lead around and made to feel guilt by commercialism and materialism, this is more than a childrens book, it is one that ascends time.

It was a new detctive type story with a different element.  BUT.. it was very British.

I picked this book up becaue at the time, I couldn't find anything better. I was an 80's child and although I did like Motley, I prefered their more pop tours, like \\"girls, girls, girls\\" and \\"Dr. Feelgood\\", not so much the heavier rock like \\"Shout at the Devil\\". Id rather listen to (and look at) Poison and Bon Jovi. But who couldnt be in love with Vince, Tommy, and Nikki, anyway? So going into it indifferently, I opened the book and did not put it down until the last 430 long pages. Holy cow!! What a read. It is lewd and crewed, it is Motley crue. The book is set up different, each band member and occasionally a manager or a big wig from a elektra records will have there own chapter, it may be a small chapter or not, but its like they are talking to you directly, telling you there own expierences from the very first years of Motley to the present. And its funny how they have their own stories and disagree with one another, like who was the cause of this certain fight, etc.. But not so funny was so much info and hardship that they each expierenced in their own right. My God, who knew? Mick Mars is a skitzo, Tommy is starving for attention, Nikki is or strives to be the leader and Vince is a sex maniac! (Well they are pretty much all big time sex driven :) unreal some of these stories!!) The way it is written in their own words, litterally, you can actually hear it, for example, Tommy's chapters are filled with \\"dude\\" and \\"yo bro\\". But it is purly a book that you can no way put down, each chapter leaves you in suspense for what happened next in the tour, or in the lives. Be warned, if you have virgin ears (or eyes in this case) this book is in no way for you. The amount of talk about sex and drugs is the majority, and it is in no way proper. It is almost porn. It is just true to life and pure Motley Crue.	2002-08-29

I really enjoyed Men in Black one, the movie,  and reading this book, you totally have the images for Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, as agents Jay and Kay, respectfully.  This book was written with them totally in mind.  It reads just like it is coming out of Will Smiths own mouth.  The action, the description, the humor, what a cool read!!	2002-07-30

I am very close to my mother and as years pass I fear the inevitable.  I think I purchased this book to convince myself that when my mom passes, she will not be far from me.  <BR>     This is a collaboration of short stories written by many different woman who have had many different realtionships with their mothers.  Some of the stories seemed far fetched to me, or I had questions of &quot;what would give you even the slightest idea that that particular thing or occurance could have been a sign from your mother???&quot; but more often or not, it was touching to know these woman, what ever they may have expierenced, gave them comfort that their moms were letting them know they were still loved and not forgotten.  And then they were some stories that sent me reeling with tears and chills up my spine.  Either way, it is a good read.	2002-07-30

And if the HBO special \\"autopsy\\" held you on the edge of your seat, this is just a continuation.  It has everything in here, from celebrity autopsies, to everyday people.  It is not morbid and creepy, although some aspects may make the weak queasy, its realism and therefore compelling.  It amazes as to how a medical examiner can solve a crime and pin point time and cause of death.  Just a interest-keeper of a read, not only for anyone in the medical field, or forensics, but simply everyone.	2002-06-22

If you are an avid reader, and thus have read other bios of Jim Carrey, this book, although seemingly accurate, is just a time filler.  Nothing new, just a different premise.  As an adoring Jim Carrey fan forever, it was fine to finish through, and it listed all of his screen prefomances, even had a Jim Carrey quiz to see how much you know, but this isnt a book of defined details.  It is very brief and seems geared toward teens. Much better JC bios out there, but it will do for the time being.	2002-06-16

This is a fine tribute, but it should be kept as a memorial or a showcase.  This isnt a book for memorializing, it is a book of pictures FROM the memorial that was set up by Mr. Feldschuh.  It is sometimes hard to see, many pictures are blurry and hard to make out.  A lot of the pictures or captions are cut off as they are trying to represent what the gallery was.  <BR>     If you are looking for a good book to remember the terrible fate we beheld, go for &quot;One Nation&quot;  absolutly riviting, from cover to cover!	2002-06-12

I was in search of a book memoralizing September 11.  I wanted mainly pictures, with slight descriptions.  I wanted to open the cover to see the two tall towers beaming in their prime with pride.  And being a New Yorker, I wanted to see the whole truth.  People are mortified by the images of people jumpimg from the towers.  This is realism.  This is what we all went through.  I didnt want anything sugar coated for me, or better yet for my childrens children that look upon this tragedy in years to come.  These are the unfathomable images that sparked rage and fury against anyone who terrorizes our country.  This is what made us truly unite. This book had it all. I will save it until the end of time and pass it along to generations to come to see what I/we lived through and how I am so proud, not only to be an American, but a New Yorker!	2002-06-11

This was an array of mainly individual survivors aroung the WTC sight.  Thats fine.  I however, was looking for more truth.  I wanted something to memorialize being a NYer myself, knowing people that had to escape, I was looking for realism.  I wanted to open the book to see two tall beaming towers in their prime pre 9/11.  I wanted to close the book in tears to the true after math.  No such luck.  Indiviual photographers took an artistic array of pictures of individual people in their own greif.  Harboring no morbidity, we can not sugar coat this horrowing tragedy.  Thousands of lives were lost.  When my childrens children read this book to see what we all went through, I want them to know people had to do horrendous things to try to fight for their lives.  If you want an awesome book to remember, pick up \\"One Nation\\", from cover to cover it is perfect. True reality, no euphamisims.	2002-06-11
US	49658563	RM7MFWRSF6QPO	0786867647	913320116	Lucky Man: A Memoir	Books	3	12	23	N	N	Sad that it takes PD to realize life value....	I am very ambivalent about this book.  Growing up watching and admiring Mike Fox from Family ties to Spin City and all in between, I thought him more humble.  Maybe I didnt need to know about his wild partying/drinking days, or the way he got away with speeding, or how an abundance of free merchandice landed at his door step.  How his rocket to celebrity along with piles of wealth colaborate with his Parkinsons disease, explains why he considers himself a &quot;lucky man&quot;, but I would have been happy with the image I had created in my mind as a good ol' boy, kid next door, and just knowing his symptoms and harrowing expierence leading up to a diagnosis.  For what ever reason he sought to expose himself to the public is fine and just, but maybe a little too much information?  I did enjoy the read and learning of his childhood and family.  So, I guess the judgement is for you to make.  Happy reading.	2002-06-11

What a let down. Having known individuals that went through the same surgery as she for the same reasons, reading this book has given me much more respect for those \\"non- celebs\\" who, I see now, were much stronger, without the luxuries Fran had. Not to dismis the ordeal she went through, the book just was not what I had hoped for. Even her literal sense did her no good to raise her appreciation in my eyes. It goes from slang to intelligence in one paragraph. I would however like to mention, as an animal lover, her chapter deicated to her dog, Chester. Although she is no poet either, it was very touching.	2002-06-06

Well, I can admit when I am wrong.  Recieving this book as a gift, as I am an avid biography fan, I drudgingly opened the cover, and without the scour on my face as I suspected, I did not put this book down until Rosie's final word.  She was human!  She did have compassion without just throwing her money around buying lavish gifts for all.  She was even insecure, compulsive and sensitive.  Wow. Im not going to run out and get her magazine, or watch the re-runs of her show, but by her words, her own words, she is now ok in my book.  <BR>     This book does not dwell on her preference for women, there is hardly any indication of that at all.  It is a portrayal of her life and the humanity that makes her &quot;real&quot;.  The lay out of the book itself keeps you wondering and changes the pace enough to keep ones interest.  Of course there are mentions to how overwhelmingly wealthy she is, but what celeb cant keep it quiet. She, unlike the others, when love or money is at stake, she makes no bones she will take the love.  True or not, I bought it!  Way to go Rosie!	2002-06-06

I felt that this book screams out \\"Hey, what about me?\\".  As a daughter of a war veteran, he makes a comparison to the men returning home from vietnam and the cold reception they had recieved, to his first moments out of the collapsed building, with no one to pat him on the back.  Whoa, this was unsettling for me.  I also was quite annoyed at the reference made to David Lim, the Port Authority worker, who in his panic called for someone to care for his dog, mans best friend, and Piccitto thought it petty and a waste of batteries on walkie talkies.  Who is to make that judgement in a time like that?  Being an animal lover myself, it would have been the first thoughts to my head.  But it isnt just about small references.  I, like the entire country was devastated.  I do not want to take anything away from any individual.  We each grieve in our own way.  Here is the thing, this book was totally geared to the burocracy of the FDNY.  He persistantly makes references to how the \\"higher-ups\\" take away or dont give enough even in his acknowledgements, he goes on and on which such things as the FDNY have to buy their own toilet paper.  It left a bad taste in my mouth and I feared that it kept up with the bad rap that NYers recieve.  Hey folks, we are all not like that!!	2002-06-06
