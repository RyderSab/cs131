A good introduction to hygiene (including some of the &quot;why bothers&quot;).  There is a small glossary at the back of the book defining terms such as germs, bacteria, earwax...  I was hoping, however, for a simpler text for my toddler.  Perhaps I am underestimating my daughter, but I am guessing that the word disease is not in her vocabulary yet!  So, I will add my own comments.  When a &quot;sidebar&quot; says &quot;There are more harmful germs and bacteria under your fingernails than on a toilet seat!&quot;  I will simply add &quot;Germs make you sick!&quot; or some such sentence.  All in all, a good basic introduction to hygiene.	2001-05-21

This a fun Puerto Rican version of the Lazy Jack stories.  Actually, I like the ending better than in Lazy Jack.  It bothered me that some poor girl would be stuck marrying a fool like Lazy Jack simply because he made her laugh.  That could make for a very looooong, trying marriage!  But a useful reward, that seems quite appropriate.  Anyway, the illustrations are cheery and charming.  A nice addition to a folktale collection!	2001-05-19

I first discovered this book looking up the order of the Paddington Bear series.  Just today I used it to look up the sequel to _A wrinkle in time_ (it's _A wind in the door_).  Like many people, I prefer to read series in order and this is a comprehensive resource which includes childrens and adult series. There are, however, some gaps.  Neither of Mary Daheim's mystery series is listed, for example.  The book is broken into three main sections: Sequels and sequences ; Title index ; and Author index.	2001-05-19

For those of you who learned to read with the Dick and Jane books, the latest New Reader books are a whole different class.  One pleasing trend is the introduction of well-loved characters and stories to new readers.  (One example is the _My first little house books_ series).  Enter a new series called Peter's neighborhood, based on the beloved characters created by Ezra Jack Keats.  The pictures are eye-catching, reminiscent, naturally, of Keats' style.  The simple story is also pleasing with three friends working together to catch the escaped class hamster.  Well worth a read.	2001-05-19

(For those of you who have just read the same book for the fifth time today to your little one, this is no mystery!).  Toddlers also love construction vehicles.  The story is a cumulative tale written in the &quot;House-That-Jack- Built&quot; style and has bright illustrations showing a 4-story building going up.  In other words, _The lot at the end of the block_ is a winning combination for toddlers and other young children who are intrigued by construction.  Beware though, your tongue may become tied after multiple readings!  I do wish that there was at least one &quot;token&quot; female operating some heavy equipment...	2001-05-19

Beaton's illustrations are unique.  She uses felt, buttons, beads and bric-a-brac, creating truly colorful and eye-catching  pictures that toddlers will enjoy.<br />Each letter of the alphabet has its  own page, for the most part with an animal &quot;chasing&quot; a child,  ranging from &quot;Carla&quot; being chased by a cat to &quot;Wendy&quot;  being chased by a wolf. The wolf looks rather ferocious so I imagine some  children might find a few of the illustrations frightening. (Then again  Grimm's very grim fairy tales have been told to children for centuries...)  <br />To be truthful, the title of the book is what first caught my eye--my  daughters name is Zoe...  Because there are probably other people out there  who would like to find a book with their child's name in it, here is the  list of names used: Alice, Ben, Carla, Dylan, Erin, Farooq, Gopinder,  Hamadi, India, Jacob, Kylie, Luke, Martha, Naiser, Olga, Pedro, Queenie,  Reuben, Sita, Takeshi, Ursula, Victor, Wendy, Xavier, Yoko, and Zoe.
