After she found out she was with child, strange things started happening, and she realized that someone was trying to kill her - and her child! <br /> <br />I love gothic novels, and this one is one of the best!

Through a strange turn of events, she was raised in an &quot;adopted&quot; household with her &quot;adopted&quot; sister, Belinda.  She grew up knowing she was not of the same class, and therefore not of the same treatment.  Then, unexpectedly, the truth comes out.  She is actually the real daughter, and Belinda is the adopted one!  All of this was revealed in the previous book in the series &quot;The Changeling&quot;.  When &quot;The Black Swan&quot; opens, Lucie is the beloved daughter of Benedict Landson, a distinguished politician.  Her life is shattered when he is assassinated right in front of her.  To make matters worse, her fianc√©, Joel, is murdered while on a mission to Africa.  She gradually grows away from her tragedy, and becomes more resigned to life.  However, she is haunted by the apparition of her father's murderer, whom she helped convict and thus had an indirect hand in his execution.  She meets a brother and sister, of whom she grows fond.  Eventually, they all live in the same household and strange things begin to happen.  Lucie soon realizes that someone is trying to kill her, and will do so soon, unless Lucie can do something to stop it.<br />I enjoyed this book very much, as I seem to do with all of Philippa Carr's.  I did figure out some of the mystery, but I was very shocked with the actual ending.  I would recommend reading this after you have read &quot;The Changeling&quot; so that the big surprises from the previous book are not lost.	2004-06-02

As usual, I was very excited to read the next Royal Diaries book.  I was, as I can see is the same with many others, extremely disappointed.  I did read the whole thing, even though I was very tempted to just throw it away all together.  I thought it would get better as I went on.  Wrong!  I couldn't really find a point.<br />The basic outline is that there is a princess that has been betrothed to the king of a section of the Mayan empire to unite both of their provences.  Almost the entire book is about her trip.  Basically \\"it's raining, and I saw some lovely fish today and I ate a papaya for dinner\\" kind of entries.  If it had been as boring as it was, but did give me a picture of what life was like back then, as far as cutoms, etc, I would have been happier with it.  There was hardly any.  I didn't really learn very much about the Mayan empire, if anything.  Please, if you are to start reading Royal Diaries books, please don't start with this one!  Or, if you are a Royal Diaries fan, don't read this one either!  It isn't worth it.	2004-05-23

I put it off for a while, but a week ago I bit the bullet and started reading The Fellowship of the Ring.  Am I glad I did!<br />Many of you probably know the storyline, but for those of you whom don't, I will briefly put it out.  Frodo Baggins lives in the secluded Shire, far away from the real world of elves, men, dwarves, and other creatures.  As a hobbit, he lives without much interruption.  One day, he discovers his uncle left him a ring with evil powers.  His friend, Gandalf discovers this, and they decide they must get rid of it.  So Frodo travels with his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin to Rivendale, to Elrond, a wise elf that will know what to do with it.  Along the way, they have many adventures, and almost loose their lives several times.  Once there, it is decided that there should be a group, or \\"fellowship\\", that will take the ring to Mount Doom, the only place it can be destroyed.  The group is made up of nine: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the elf, Boromir the man, Aragorn the man and heir to Gondor, and Gandalf the wizard.  They soon realize the quest shan't be as easy as they thought, and the fellowship threatens to break.<br />Once again, I am glad I read this book!  Although I knew most of it, it was fun reading it and finding out the history of everything and the new scenes and characters.  The first thirty pages or so are hard to get through because it is basically a history of hobbits with a bunch of foreign names and places.  Once you get through that, it becomes of wonderful read.  Even though they say you should read the book before you watch the movie, I disagree.  There was so much description and complicated plots that you should know the story first.	2004-02-11

She was the wrong person in the wrong place in the wrong time.  She grew up in the virtuous court of the Hapsburgs and married into that of scandalous France.  There, she found a shy husband, admirers, but mostly enemies.  Eventually, the King died, and she and Louis became rulers of France.  The people were ready to admire the new king and queen, especially when the new rulers declared France would be great.  Fueled by power hungry men and women, the people's love soon turned to hate as the people' became poorer and the aristocracy followed Marie Antoinette's lead and became more extravagant.  She didn't understand how her foolishness would lead to downfall until it was too late.  Things spiraled out of control, and before they knew it, the royal family was prisoners in the hands of their own subjects.  And everyone knows the fate of Marie Antoinette after this: the guillotine.<br />While I was reading this book, I was impatient to finish it, because I wanted to read another one.  Even under these circumstances, Jean Plaidy's work never ceased to lose its richness.  She is a great author, even to the impatient reader.	2004-01-29

It is the same man, Louis XV, but the people have a different regard for him.  He was hated so much that he feared passing through the city of Paris.  He built an alternate route: The Road to Compiegne.<br />He is known for his many mistresses.  Probably the most famous is Madame de Pompadour.  She reigns supreme in the court of Versailles, much to the dissatisfaction of the King's family: a pious wife, and equally pious Dauphin and Dauphine, and a flock of slightly mad daughters.  As Madame de Pompadour's romantic attraction fades, she comes up with a brilliant plan: the Parc aux Cerfs, basically a brothel of young girls for the King.  In doing so, she gives up her role as mistress and becomes the King's best friend.  She remains so for over 20 years, and is able to keep her power, a feat that is almost impossible with Louis XV.  When she dies, he is desolate, and tries to replace his beloved Pompadour.  Jest when he is about ready to give up all hope of doing so, he meets and falls in love with no other but Madame du Barry . . .<br />This book isn't the best book by Jean Plaidy.  Unlike most of her other books, this one drags on at points.  Also, some parts are confusing.  That may be because I am not familiar with the French names.  But Madame de Pompadour has always fascinated me, and I was glad to learn more about her.	2004-01-22

They will not allow her to associate with anyone that has not been thoroughly and critically checked to make sure Victoria is not made harmed by their very presence.  Even her governesses are under scrutiny.  She is not even allowed to be alone!  Someone must always be with her.

She has scheming uncles trying to usurp her right to the throne, and family fighting over her.  Every day she comes closer to her dream of adulthood, and her guards' despair at loss of power.<br />This is the first book in the Queen Victoria Series, as well as the first one that I have read in the series (I think that is how they plan for you to read them!).   I have read the Royal Diaries version, as well as the A&amp;E mini-series &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot;.  I was very pleased to find them saying the same things about Queen Victoria's early life.

Her only crime was her generous eccentricity, not very fitting for a princess, and later a queen.  She grew up in Brunswick with more freedom and love than usually received by one of her station.  She had more than her share of scandals and practical jokes, but she still was offered the hand of the Prince of Wales.  The marriage was ill fated, as she was the opposite of what George admired in women.  He proceeded to humiliate her at every possible occasion, and only stayed with her long enough to get an heir.  After his daughter, Charlotte, was born, he continued to make her life unlivable, perhaps encouraging her eccentric behavior.  Her generous nature and tragic life won her the love of the people, causing more hatred from the Prince.  He tried everything in his power to be rid of her, even trying to try her for adultery, and making his marriage dissolved.  If you thought that was scandalous enough, wait until George became King, and Caroline demanded her rights!<br />This is the last book in the Georgian Saga that I read, making my collection complete!  As with every book in this magnificent collection, it was very well written and enjoyable to read.  I would recommend it to any fan of history, or reading in general.	2004-01-10

She also learned the horrors of queenship, and became grateful of the fact she would never become one . . . or so she thought. After the death of Henry VIII, she became the ward of Thomas Seymour, uncle of the new king and brother of the Lord Protector. She was not an orphan. She was &quot;bought&quot; for a chance at marriage to her cousin, King Edward VI. It was no wish of her's, but at least it brought her closer to her close friend, Catherine Parr, for Catherine married Thomas Seymour shortly after becoming a widow. The three of them lived happily and peacefully with an addition, Princess Elizabeth, half sister to the king and future Queen Elizabeth I. This bliss was shattered when Elizabeth and Thomas began a flirtation with one another, leading to the dismissal of Elizabeth and the heartbreak of Catherine. Soon after, the former queen died at childbirth and Thomas followed soon after, although not to sickness. He was executed as a traitor.<br />Jane left this troubled past and tried to begin again at Bradgate with her abusive parents.  As with most noble families, they did not stay long there, but traveled around England. During this time, Jane fell in love with Edward Seymour, son of the Lord Protector. It was smiled upon by her parents and Jane was for a brief time happy. Then, the Lord Protector was executed for treason at the hands of the new Lord Protector, The Duke of Northumberland. Jane's hopes for marriage with Edward were dashed, and she was forced to marry Northumberland's son, Guildford Dudley. Although she tried, the marriage was not a happy one. It was then that her life changed drastically again.<br />A few weeks after marriage, Jane was pronounced Queen of England. Northumberland was able to get the dying Kingto name her as heir, even though she was only fourth in line. In doing so, it ensure England would remain Protestant and Northumberland in power, for was not Jane married to his son? Jane wasn't pleased by this turn of events, but since she thought it was God's will, she went along with it. Nine days later, the rightful heir, Mary I (later Bloody Mary), was able to take power. She became Queen, and Jane was sentenced to death. There was hope for Jane though. If Jane would convert to Catholicism, her life would be spared. With God's strength, Jane refused, and became a martyr and hero to us all at the tender age of 16.<br />As you probably can tell, I am obsessed with this great lady.  I think she should be an example to us all.  This book is good to read for anyone that is interested in the era, or wants some inspiration in life.  Not only is it accurate, but it is entertaining as well.  I also liked the interesting way it began: Jane from when she was a few months old and how she took in everything.	2004-01-04

Also, her relationship with her father became more isolated as well when he decided to get rid of his old wife's things and start dating.  If that isn't enough stress in her life, her goddess-like aunt and ever watchful and critical grandmother create a less than desirable atmosphere<br />Although it isn't the best book around, it still was interesting.  I enjoy reading about Jewish culture and traditions.  It certainly had a lot of that in it!  I did think it was a bit unrealistic, because it seems at times like she is mourning for herself rather than her mother.  She also doesn't mourn as much as I think I would if my mom died.

She was the daughter of a mere knight, but became Queen of England.  By doing so, she displaced Henry VIII's faithful and loving wife and daughter, broke England from Rome, and changed the course of history.  But, she failed to give Henry VIII his much-desired son, and went the way of those he didn't like - the axe.<br />Her cousin, Catherine Howard had a similar fate.  She was secretly not a virgin when she married Henry VIII, and once it was discovered, as well as the fact she was having an affair with Thomas Culpepper, she too went to the execution block.<br />This is my least favorite Jean Plaidy book.  Her others are painstakingly historically accurate, yet this one is shockingly not so.  She says that Anne Boleyn was Henry's mistress 4 years before she really was.  Also, Jane Seymour is said to have been his mistress before marriage and pregnant at the time of marriage, when all historical information says the opposite.  And perhaps the worst offense, it makes Thomas Cramner look terrible, and even goes as far as to call him a coward on several occasions.  He is one of my heroes, and the very fact that he was burned at the stake for refusing to embrace Catholicism shows he was no coward.  For a more historically accurate portrayal of these times, try The Lady in the Tower, also by Jean Plaidy.	2003-12-25

George IV, when he is Prince of Wales, falls in love with Maria FitzHerbert.  Unlike the other women he's fallen in love with, this one refuses to become his mistress.  Why doesn't he marry her?  There is a slight problem.  It is illegal for an heir to the throne of England to marry a Catholic.  If he does marry her, he will give up his right.  He secretly marries her, and after a few years of happiness, he realized his mistake.  But when he realizes it wasn't a mistake, he had already left her.  What follows is a lifetime of even more heartbreak for the poor Prince.<br />If you've read The Secret Wife of King George IV, you may be cautious about reading this one.  Don't worry!

I started it with slight optimism based on what I heard it was about.  I also was anticipating a less than pleasing novel, since we previously read Lord of the Flies and Catcher in the Rye, both of which I was very displeased.  My doubts soon disappeared, as I became mesmerized with George Orwell's novel.  It was so wonderfully written that I could barely take my eyes off of it (much to the annoyance of several of my teachers).  Even though I had to reread the last page a few times, the message therein was powerful.  This book is definitely one of my favorites that I have read in school, and maybe my life.

The tragedies were not in vein, for it made Florrie a stronger person, as you will find in the end.<br />I enjoyed The Wild and Lonesome Prairie, so I thought I would enjoy this.  I did.  As with most Dear America books, it was well written, it kept me turning pages, and it was educational.  For instance, did you know Santa Fe means \\"holy faith\\"?	2003-12-02

She had been a widow for a few years, and had no wish to marry again.  William was illegitimate, but that was no reason for his father, Robert \\"the Devil\\" of Normandy, not to give young William the title.  In reaction to her refusal, William ambushed Matilda and threw her in the mud.  It was the start of a stormy and passionate love story.<br />William went on to conquer England.  He ended the Saxon reign, and began the line of English royalty, as we know it today.  By his side sat Matilda, his friend, his enemy, his queen.  In fact, she was the first English queen, since before, they were merely consorts. It was a bit hard getting used to Gerson's writing style.  Nevertheless, I read it and enjoyed it.  I particularly found interesting the battle scenes.  I usually don't like reading them because they are beyond my understanding.  In The Conqueror's Wife, they were described in a way I could understand and envision.  It also wasn't gory, which is always a plus.	2003-11-30

Eventually, she meets Sophia Charlotte and they become best friends.  Sophia Charlotte introduces Caroline to the world of learning, in which Caroline quickly becomes involved.  Caroline also becomes a friend with Sophia, who has a very good chance of becoming the next ruler of England.  Caroline is convinced to marry George, Sophia's grandson.  Around this same time, Sophia Charlotte dies, leaving Caroline desolate.  Caroline eventually bears many children, and is smart enough to know how to deal with her husband properly.  Her father-in-law is also created King of England, since Sophia recently died.  Caroline was smart enough to learn English, so she and her husband or loved much more than the king in England.  The king has his revenge, though.  Their son is made to live in Germany, and their younger children are sent to live with the king.  Somehow, Caroline and George live through the reign, and are crowned King and Queen.<br />I enjoyed this book a lot.  Caroline is an admirable woman that I would be proud to have my friend (if she were alive).  Plaidy brings her to life so vividly, I feel like I know her.	2003-11-30

Hall large print book series)	Books	5	3	8	N	N	A Tragic Story from Early Georgian History	Princess Sophia Dorothea lives a sheltered life with her parents in Celle.  Her father is manipulated into making her marry George, the heir to Hanover.  There, she lives a sad life as the wife of George.  His mistresses are flaunted in front of her, and he treats her badly.  She does bear him two children, another George and another Sophia Dorothea.<br />She falls in love with a handsome count from Sweden and they have an affair.  They are caught, however, and he is murdered and she is banished.  She lives the rest of her life in exile.  When her husband is proclaimed King of England, she is refused the title of Queen.  She eventually dies, alone, about the same time as her husband<br />I think Sophia Dorothea was really stupid, but tragic.  She should have found a better way out of her misery.  I did enjoy reading this book though.  As all of Jean Plaidy's, it is very well written.	2003-11-30

There are a lot of unsuitable bits in it including SWEARING, PROSTITUTION, DRUNKENESS, and other things.  I have no idea why it is considered such a classic.

In this Jean Plaidy book, Henry VII is portrayed as a man bent on doing what is best for his country.  That may include usurping a crown, killing innocent men and children, and being on the miserly side.  Although from that description you may take an immediate dislike to him, beware.  Jean Plaidy has a way of changing your mind.  She even made me feel more understanding of Philip II of Spain in The Spanish Bridegroom!<br />At first, I thought this book might be on the boring side.  I quickly changed my mind.  When has Jean Plaidy ever let me down?  Also, this gives back some dignity to Richard III, after it was wrenched from the Tudor propagandist, William Shakespeare.	2003-11-24

That all changed when she fell in love with Charles Brandon, her brother, Henry VIII's best friend.  As she expected, she was forced to marry someone else.  To cheer her up, her brother told her that if she became a widow, he would let her marry anyone she wanted.  She then went to France and became the Queen, but that didn't last for long.  After the death of her husband, she married Charles Brandon, and started her life.<br />Since I was longing for this book for so long, I think I was a little let down with it.  It was still an amazingly good read.  I especially liked the information about the early life of Francois Premier and Mary's life after her marriage to Charles Brandon.	2003-11-16

George I has finally died, and George II is proclaimed King and Caroline of Ansbach, his wife, is the Queen.  Much to their dismay, almost all of the jewels were given away to the former king's mistresses.  In fact, they had to have jewels loaned to them for the coronation ceremony!<br />Throughout their reign, they bring England back to where is should be, mostly through Caroline and Walpole, the Prime Minister.  Caroline hides her illness from her husband and the world.  Eventually, when is must be known, the world mourns and her husband declares, &quot;No one is fit to buckle her shoe!&quot;<br />Jean Plaidy is one of my favorite authors, and whenever I find a book of hers, I get very excited.  Not only are they wonderful to read, but they are unfortunately difficult to find.  This one is superb, as all the rest of them are, and is an excellent choice.	2003-10-12

She is the exact opposite of what perfection is.  She has a sixth finger, a mole on her neck, dark features, and she is thin.  She grows up at her father's estate of Hever, they is transported to the French court.  There she learns about life and human nature.  When she comes home to England, she discovers this knowledge can lead to power and queenship.  On her long trek to second wife of Henry VIII, she changes the course of English (and world) history, displaces several good people, and makes a lot of enemies.  Her victory is short-lived, as her enemies soon change the victory around.<br />I am so glad that they decided to reprint Plaidy's work!  She is an excellent author that deserves to be read.  This book was a good choice to start with, because it is so fun to read even if you think you know the story!	2003-10-12

George III comes to the throne at a young age, determined to do duty and service to his country.  He starts this by saying good-bye to his love, Sarah Lennox, and marries Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz as he is expected.  He will stay faithful to her for the rest of his life, unlike most of his predecessors.  She will eventually bear him sixteen children.<br />Throughout his reign, he dealt with his wayward family, rebellious politicians, America, and madness.  It is sad to think that one of England's monarchs most bent on doing good is thought badly of due to America and madness.  This book gives George back some of his dignity<br />I liked this book because like all of Plaidy's books, it is well written, yet informative.  I always learn while I am entertained by her unique style.	2003-10-11

George, Prince of Wales (later George IV), rebels against his puritanical father as soon as he is able.  He takes mistresses, eats and drinks to excess, gambles, and joins forces with his father, the King's, enemies, the Whigs.  Soon, Charles James Fox and William Brinsley Sheridan are running his life.  Then, one night at a performance of Shakespeare's &quot;A Winter's Tale&quot;, he sees Mary Robinson playing Perdita.  She becomes George's first official mistress, among several in his lifetime.<br />This book gives an accurate portrayal of aristocratic life in the eighteenth century.  It also gives you an inside look to the lives of some of England's most celebrated personalities.  Although many of the characters could hardly be called admirable, this book is an excellent choice for anyone interested in the time period or English history in general.	2003-10-11

I was not entirely surprised, because they also did When Will this Cruel War be Over?  I am glad that Scholastic is not worried about being politically correct, and is brave enough to explore new frontiers.  Hats off to Scholastic!<br />Prudence lives in America around the time of the American Revolution.  Contrary to popular belief, not everyone was ready to break with England.  Prudence's family is one of the forgotten families, ones that are loyalists.  She and her family deal with Patriots using terrorism to get them to leave or change sides.

They also bring over several families.  Rev. Rogers (Polly's dad) is the optimistic leader of the group.  They are imagining perfect weather and easy money.  They get none of it.  It is difficult to farm, and the summers are too hot and winters too cold.  Tragedy is commonplace.  Yet, the Rogers family pulls through and sticks together to survive.<br />This Dear America isn't the best.  In fact, it is one of my least favorites.  There is a lot of boring bits and there are no real jaw-dropping things that happen (like most of the other ones).  It does accurately portray Minnesota.  I live here, and the weather is awful, and the people aren't very nice.  I have been all over, and this is my least favorite place.	2003-09-27

This book actually should be under one of Victoria Holt's other pen names, Jean Plaidy.  Plaidy writes about actual historical figures.  <br />The Queen's Confession is told by Marie Antoinette herself.  Well, not actually, but how she would have written it.  She grows up in the Austrian court under the guidance of her mother, the Empress Maria Therese.  She marries the Dauphin of France and deals with the &quot;uncrowned queen&quot;, Madame du Barry.  Finally, she becomes queen and started the beginning of the end of the French monarchy.  Scandal, intrigue, and flamboyancy were never as great, and the consequences are even greater.<br />This book was wonderful!  I actually learned a lot about her (I thought I knew everything!).  Also, it is a good book to read if you are in for a good cry.	2003-09-26

Lenore lives in &quot;The Silk House&quot; with her grandmother at the top floor.  They aren't servants, but they aren't family.  The owners of the Silk House are silk makers vying against a rival family in France.  Lenore falls in love and marries one of the sons of the house, but he commits suicide right after the marriage.  Or did he?  His brother wants her, too, but she will have none of it.  She opens a dressmaking shop in London, hoping to escape the past, but she soon learns that she can never escape the silk vendetta.<br />This Victoria Holt book isn't as interesting as the others.  There is also a part with a dog dying that bothers me (I am very sensitive in regard to cruelty to animals).  Also, the &quot;bad-guy&quot; is really obvious.  Still, it is a good read and I would recommend it.	2003-09-26

He is slow, but tries very hard.  He is also kind and gentle, but not thought of as much.  One day, while riding out in the street, he gets a glance of Hannah Lightfoot.  He instantly falls ion love with her.  When one of his mother's ladies in waiting tries to win favor with him, he jumps at the opportunity of meeting Hannah.

She is whisked off to a secluded house where she and George secretly live as man and wife.  After a while, they are even secretly married.  When Lord Bute, his mother's lover and leader of the household finds out, he finds Hannah and she mysteriously disappears.  George is told she is dead.  He begins to realize how dangerous it would be to the monarchy if she had lived, so he is in a way grateful.  <br />The King George II, his grandfather, dies, and George III is king.  Once again, he falls in love, this time with Sarah Lennox.

Some other Christians read it, and didn't say anything bad about it so I thought I would give it a try.  I'm glad I did!  Don't be frightened!  The occult is just mentioned, and is frowned upon.  It is all right for a Christian to read!<br />Susanna grew up in India, but went to school in England.  On her return visit, she finds Aubrey St. Clare (It is a man!  I've known girls named Aubrey, but this one is a man!).  They fall in love and marry back in England.  Her marriage is all but shattered when she finds out Aubrey is into opium and the occult.  She tries to make the marriage work, but when Aubrey's way of life causes her son to die, she leaves forever.  Before she regrets it, Aubrey dies as well.  <br />She decides to leave England and become a nurse, but she never forgives Dr. Damien Adair, the man she blames for Aubrey's downfall and her son's death.  Much to her surprise, she meets up with Damien and, is it love?  Could she love the man that ruined her husband and son?<br />This Victoria Holt book is different because the ending isn't very suspenseful, and the &quot;bad-guy&quot; isn't trying to hurt the heroine.  Still, it is very good, like her others.	2003-09-26

It is very well written, and it really makes you think, &quot;Was Philip II of Spain a good guy, doing everything he did out of duty, or was he bad, doing it out of hatred and sadism?&quot;  I didn't like him before I read this book because of his role in the Inquisition and the fact that I blame him for my heroine's death, Lady Jane Grey (hence my nickname).  I still wonder.<br />Philip II grew up with duty always first.  He was serous about everything, and he always acted like an adult.  His first marriage was his choice.  He fell in love with his first wife, but never knew how to tell her.  She died before he got a chance.  Around this time, the Inquisition started heating up, under his control.  Also, Mary I cam to the throne in England.  She was a Catholic trying to bring Catholicism back to England, as well as the Inquisition.  The marriage would be good for Philip, but he had no feeling towards Mary, and the English hated him.  He married anyway, and in a few years, she died as well.  After she died, Philip had to make another alliance, this time with France.  He married the daughter of the King.  Once again, he fell in love, and once again, she died before he could tell her.  Philip had a son by his first wife that was not quite right in the head and he tried to kill Philip.  Philip thought it was his duty to his country to get rid of his son.  For the sake of Spain, he did.<br />From reading this review, you will probably despise Philip.  I am not a good a writer a Plaidy, so I cannot be surprised.  The only thing I ask is to read this book before you judge him.	2003-09-26

It is mostly about the revolution.	2003-09-25

It is about four generations of daughters, and a dark family secret that keeps popping up.  My mom loves Lynn Austin's books, and I was wanting to start reading some Christian novels, so she gave me this one to start on.  At first, it seemed really boring, but the more I read, the more I wanted to read!  I was so upset when it was over!!!  I would recommend this to everyone, even if they aren't a Christian.	2003-09-22

I have always liked the stories of Jane Eyre and Rebecca, so this one sounded interesting.  It lived up to expectations.  It is about a governess that finds out she is in much more than she bargained for.  The house she is living in is filled with history and mystery.  Her employer, with whom she falls in love, is very much the same.  With twists and turns, and a huge surprize ending, this book is one you will remember for years to come.	2003-09-22

I was very disappointed.  It only follows the bare framework of her life, and is hardly appropriate reading material for respectable people.  It paints Maria as a very stupid woman, when in fact, she was extremely smart.  She also was more moral than she is portrayed.  I am glad that I am not her, because everyone that reads this book without knowing the facts would think that I am the exact opposite of what I stand for.  For a better read, try Sweet Lass of Richmond Hill by Jean Plaidy.<br />The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the well written.  I only wish Ms. Haeger would use her talent more respectfully and truthfully.	2003-09-21

This is one of my favorite Jean Plaidy books (along with all of her pen names), which is saying a lot since she has written hundereds!  This book tells the story of the result of the ill-fated marriage between George IV, then Prince of Wales, and Caroline of Brunswick.  Charlotte, their only child, lived a sad life always trying to win love from those she loved.  <br />Plaidy writes this story perfectly with impressive attention to historical detail.  If anyone is interested in starting to read Plaidy's work, this is a wonderful place to start (but where is is not?!).	2003-09-20
