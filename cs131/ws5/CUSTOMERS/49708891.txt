This is one of the most enjoyable, perceptive and mesmerizing fantasy novels in a long time.  Seyonne is a character that you will truly care about and root for.  The writing is smooth, the conflicts plentiful and the final pages will blow you away.<BR>     &quot;Transformation&quot; reminded me of Gary Jennings's novel &quot;Raptor&quot; in many ways, even though &quot;Raptor&quot; isn't considered to be a fantasy.  Everything about the book is superb except for the back cover.  &quot;FREEDOM IS THE ABILITY TO MAKE A CHOICE.&quot;  What drivel!  Ability has nothing to do with it.  Freedom is the OPPORTUNITY to make a choice.<BR>     Carol Berg is a sparkling talent and this book is highly recommended.	2002-08-30

This is a superb edition of Dickinson's poems.  It is &quot;reader friendly&quot; with updated punctuation (which purists may not like) with an excellent selection.  The Billy Collins introduction is outstanding, being highly informative and entertaining without any pretensions whatsoever.  He adds great insight into Dickinson's use of common meter, language, metaphor, and other techniques.  Grab a bottle of water and an apple and spend a great afternoon or two with this exceptional volume.	2001-04-19

A remarkably original treatment, with many brilliant and highly perceptive passages.  You'll be rooting for Mirabelle all the way as she copes with the extremely competitve world of LA.  I found this book to be dark, with little true comedy, even though some passages are laugh-out-loud funny.  The most impressive thing, to me, is how this story can get into your mind.  You may find it difficult to think about anything else for a while.  Highly, highly recommended.	2001-01-05

After reading &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; I wanted to learn more about Vermeer and his times.  I hoped that &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; would be half as good as &quot;Blue.&quot;  If anything, &quot;Earring&quot; is better, which is almost a miracle.  This magnificent novel is a time-travel machine, taking you to the mid-late 17th century in Delft.  Others have summarized the beginning of the story, so I won't add to that and possibly create a spoiler.  Don't miss this book.  A wonderful read with a lot of insight into painters, painting and domestic life 330+ years ago.	2000-12-29

This is the slowest of the Grafton/Kinsey Millhone books, although the final 40 pages rocket to a satisfying finish.  There's definitely too much space devoted to superfluous descriptions, but it's Kinsey so all is forgiven.  Good start, mediocre middle and a great ending.

Is this going to be one of those artsy &quot;literary experiences&quot; where almost nothing happens?  NO!  Incredibly, this book is pretty much of a page-turner, with a group of inter-connected stories about a fictional Vermeer painting.  The book is done backwards, with the contemporary story first, followed by the World War II story, the turn of the century story, etc.  It works beautifully!  The characters are so well drawn that you'll come to know them well in only a few pages and you'll CARE about them.  You'll also care about the painting, so remarkably word-painted by Ms. Vreeland that every nuance of it is indelible in the mind.  When you finish the book, you'll turn back to page one and start again.  One of the best books ever, and I read evrything from Sidney Sheldon to James Joyce.	2000-10-13

King's new book is an outstanding writing manual, although King himself will be the first to say it's not a &quot;manual&quot; at all.  It's like driving across the country with the best writer in the univerwe and having a bull session about his life and writing.  Two great things: one, King not only shows you examples of bad writing, he tells you WHY it's bad.  Two, he shows a blue-pencil job he did on his own story.  The minor changes make an incredible difference in the readability and flow of the story.  This book is a brief autobiography plus a treatise on what ails much of the world of writing today.  And, if you've ever attended writing seminars or taken college classes in the subject, you will know his complaints and jabs are right on.  I only wish the book could've been 500+ pages.

It is surpassed by  Chesapeake and Hawaii, but it is still nothing short of outstanding.

This is an outstanding family (families) saga set in San Francisco around  the turn of the century (and later).  It is the first book of a  page-turning trilogy with an excellent story and Fast's usual sparkling  writing.  After a 20-year or so hiatus, Fast also wrote a fourth book about  the Lavettes that was released a couple of years ago.  The entire series is  highly recommended.	2000-08-30

Yes, he'd already won a  Pulitzer for &quot;Tales of the South Pacific,&quot; but this was the first  of the 1,000+ page epics that made him the beloved writer he is today.   There was a lot of complaining about this book when it came out in the  1950s because it was &quot;all geology.&quot;  Actually, there are about 50  or so pages of geology and prehistory to plow through before the story  really begins.  Once you get to Bora Bora, though, there's 950 pages of  non-stop reading ahead.  A tremendous story, with many great stories within  stories as well.  The movie was about Abner (if I remember correctly) but  the REALLY GREAT part of the book is about Nyuk Tsin, and that's where the  movie should've focused as well.  When you order this book order some  tickets to the islands, too.  You'll definitely want to go after reading  &quot;Hawaii.&quot;	2000-08-30

I usually don't comment on other reviews, but I don't understand the  &quot;weak ending&quot; comments.  This book is an absolute 100% triumph  from the first page to the last.  The writing, plotting, structure,  insight, etc. all are superb.  Even if you're not a big fan of police  procedurals/PI books, you'll love this one.  While I'm complaining about  reviews, the Washington Post called this a &quot;hardboiled&quot; genre  book.  &quot;L. A. Requiem&quot; defies any such labels.  It's an  outstanding novel that's unlike anything else ever in many ways.  A++++.	2000-08-04

The Robert Jordan series is  absolutely creaking.  Goodkind hasn't had a surprise in the last 3,000  pages.  G. R. R. Martin takes a long time between books.  Weis and Hickman  are in rewrite, although still good.  We've all read &quot;Rhapsody&quot;  three times.  This series is an excellent option for solving our problems.   The battle scenes are superb, there are twists and surprises, and lots of  conflict.  Aside from the fact that every character seems to &quot;flush  red in the face&quot; (or words to that effect) on every page, I thought  this one was as great as &quot;The Sword,&quot; which is unusual for the  middle book of a trilogy.  Recommended.	2000-08-04

From some of the reviews I'd read I thought this book might be 400 pages of sleaze.  Regardless, I decided to try it.  This is a highly entertaining book, with a nice pace and lots of gossip.  There are problems with typos  (including the spelling of Fisher's current wife's name), odd sentence  construction, disagreement of subject/verb, and use of the wrong word (such  as &quot;principle&quot; for &quot;principal&quot;).  It's not that the  book is ultra-sloppy in this regard, but it definitely needed a final  polish.  Meanwhile, the content is brutally truthful.  Fisher takes a lot  of shots, but, ultimately, they're mostly at himself.  Debbie gets the  worst of it, Connie is treated lightly, and Liz is a combination of acid  and gushing love.  You may or may not like it, but you definitely won't be  bored.  By the way, the paperback version is better than the hardcover, as  there's a new afterword with some good parting shots.	2000-07-27

This novel also  takes on themes besides murder, violence, the seamy side of life, etc.   Chapter 3 explores areas that he usually saves for his &quot;literary&quot;  novels, and it will remind you of his brilliant novel &quot;Streets of  Gold&quot; in many ways.   There's one blunder in the novel about the  origin of a bottle of scotch.  This is unfortunate as it creates a  unintentional red herring that might confuse the reader.

Unlike Michener, though, Harrigan is a master of characterization.  Mary Mott is one of the most intriguing characters in American fiction, and when she is  in the story the novel soars.  The characters' interrelations are so well  done, in fact, that the actual siege of the Alamo is almost subtext.      There are many aspects of this novel that you will enjoy, from the smooth  narrative to the sometimes thriller pace (and sometimes not) to the botany  lessons to the symbolism of the birds and the sawfish.  This is the book  Mr. Harrigan was born to write, and it's a great gift to the readers of the  world.	2000-05-03
