I didn't title this review lightly to suggest: \\"This book changes your life\\". It truly does. Please recall a great movie you saw in the theater, and remember how you felt good, uplifted and excited afterwards. The movie produced that ecstatic feeling. What if you could feel the sameway all the time, and get two birds with a one stone by simultaneously fulfilling your dreams, improving your own life and becoming the person that you always wanted to be? Well, ultimately you will walk the talk. <br /> <br />When a friend suggested I purhcase this book; I felt sceptical. Thought there is nothing new under the sun - after all, I considered myself somewhat all-done dynamo when it concerns self-help literature. When the book arrived, I thought this is speaking of and refering to same things I am doing with creative visualization - so would it bring any benefits? <br /> <br />It proves out I was so mistaken. The book is more than I expected....and keeps bringing greater benefits into my life. The author's contemporary writing style feels like a friend who is visiting you, and talking to you in person.  <br /> <br />It does not matter whether you are a professional or a beginner, this book is for everyone. And yes, you can hypnotize yourself for success, happiness and all good things with its guidance. And with eyes open there are several advantages. First of all, it is easy to stay focused. You are reading and imagining at the same time, so your mind does not wander around as much as with traditional creative visualization. Also, the author is a pro hypnotist and has carefully designed the techniques, for maximum effectiveness. <br /> <br />Let me tell you of my first experience with the method. After I had finished reading the introduction part, I followed the instructions for the first session. I started following instructions, and felt myself going into deep state of relaxation... My mind didn't wander around at all, and then something unbelievable happened. I felt tingles all over my body, not once, but twice. That has never happened with conventional creative visualization or meditation. <br /> <br />Also, during the first session, at one point, I had doubts whether I was really in deep state of hypnosis....but quickly continued with the method.. It was only after I had finished, 20 minutes later (it felt like 5 minutes)...that I realized it ACTUALLY worked. It truly felt rather like 5 minutes than all those 20 minutes it took. <br /> <br />I felt the same way as after the good movie I had seen, and that good feeling lasted for several hours.  <br /> <br />After the initial work is done, the book provides many ready sessions -- you can choose which ones to use, or create your own. Also, I empowered this method by including some stuff from Neville Goddard's book \\"The Law And The Promise\\". It is a highly recommended companion to this book. <br /> <br />In short, the author Mr. Blair, has written a phenomenal book... I wonder why other professionals from this field have not recognized that you can self-hypnotize yourself eyes wide open -- and sometimes it can be more effective than anything. <br /> <br />I am not kidding you.. I have been doing creative visualization for past 6 years or so....and I honestly think the results I achieved through this book's instructions helped me to assume greater control over my own life. <br /> <br />This book gives you a superior tool for growth, and when combined with other self-help books you might enjoy, you get a powerful aide in creating a life that is everything you expect of life. <br /> <br />But there is a price to pay: you must do it, not once, or twice, but consistently. Your first results may or may not be as fantastic as mine, but it is like a muscle. There is a saying that implies: \\"As you train, so shall you fight\\". Your spiritual muscle will get stronger through practice, and in a little while you have gotten yourself a great tool. <br /> <br />I feel safe to recommend this book highly. Buy it... With the price of single pizza, you can get so much fun.. and life is supposed to be fun rather than dull. <br /> <br />Also, please consider buying \\"The Law and The Promise\\" - it is the best companion to this book. Godspeed!	2005-03-05

It has been years since I first time heard of Sedona Method. I found the price for their tape/cd package too expensive. So when the book version came out, I seized the opportunity and purchased it right way. <br /> <br />The reason I am giving this book only 4 stars, not five, is the fact that it makes the method somewhat complicated to chew on. I believe the things the book explains, could have been introduced with less than 100 pages. Now the book runs for hundreds of pages, and it gets little bit annoying if you are looking for simple and down-to-earth instructions on creating success. However, if you prefer very throughly written and documented case works and explanations, then you will enjoy immensely this one as the book explains the method in great details and repeats the main points over and over again. <br /> <br />What is very helpful about the Sedona Method is that it teaches you how to release unwanted feelings. This is very important as I have proven time again that our feelings are very powerful. Habitual feelings mold our self-image which in turns molds world and experiences we encounter in the life. However, the Sedona Method fails (in my humble opinion) to stress the importance of positive emotions and self-image; and the importance of use of creative imagination. Were it to incorporate these aspects into the method, it would become an ultimate success tool. <br /> <br />In spite of this minor disagreement with the method, I strongly recommend the book -- as the method will most certainly benefit you on the journey to better quality of life by releasing all those unwanted feelings; and by so doing you will gain more happiness, greater freedom and health...even wealth and other things as a direct result. <br /> <br />However, I would suggest reading Darel Rutherford's Being The Solution along this method. They would support each other and create a powerful package for your success and all good things. I feel compelled to say that these two books areguaranteed to advance you on the next level, and so forth. Godspeed!	2004-07-27

This book did it and I am eternally Thankful for Yehuda Berg for writing this excellent introduction to Kabbalah and its secrets. Not only that, but he asks you to test these simple, yet very profound, principles and prove them to be so in your own life. Are you fed up with people telling you what to believe about your existence and power within you? I am talking about the power that is accessible to you and able to fulfill your life.<br />Don't just read this book and accept it from its face value. Rather, experiment with what this special book has to offer and the door to 99% of universe is opened for you. That means, you are living the teaching true. I would say to you as my friend that come out from the cemetry of dead and face the light; with this book it is possible.<br />You know what truly is the acid test of truth? It is that you are given the tools and can try to disprove the author. Well, he gives you the tools. Try to disprove him; and in so doing, you will be prove these eternal principles valid in your life.<br />Unfortunately, much of the wisdom of kabbalah has been hidden for ages. People were, until now, denied the access to this wonderful information. Now, since our society allows us greater freedom, it is possible for people like Yehuda Berg to come forward and explain the mystery.<br />I was a bit sceptical when buying this book -- because I have already read scores of books on the subject of mysticism. Yet this book, though elementary, has all the crucial main points that you need to know. <br />Highly Recommended. Good buy. Go for it.	2004-07-07

I truly believe that if I should require everyone to read but one book, this would be it. The author has said that he intented this book to be the simplest and easiest to apply that he has the power to make... and he has truly succeeded in writing such a great book.<br />The question on many people's lips is this: &quot;I have read so many books, why should I read another?&quot; Although you may be all done and read dynamo, this book is for you. It may not be as advanced as many other books Neville has written, but it certainly is the best guidebook to inspire, encourage and lift you up to the full potential by increasing your awareness of the power that can fulfill all of your dreams.<br />The special chapter on failure and what you can do in order to avoid failing is also something every serious truth student will find helpful.<br />Naturally, the only minus for this book comes from the fact that it mentions no word about the promise, but we can forgive that as the book was originally written in 1950s before Neville's more advanced years of teaching.<br />The author also provides a number of helpful exercises that you can use and in so doing, prove that this Truth is truly so. Don't just take my words for it, order the book and try it. I am sure that you won't be disappointed. You owe this much to yourself.	2004-04-25

This book in question is Mrs. Berlay's personal account on the creative imaginative power. She does pretty good job on explaining how to fulfill your dreams and lead a life of your dreams. It draws from the wisdom of greatest mystic ever, Neville Goddard. It is a nice book and features some of her personal case accounts which I found very interesting. <br />In case you haven't read the master Himself -- please see a title &quot;The Law and The Promise&quot; or &quot;Awakened Imagination&quot;.	2004-02-19

Generally speaking, I do appreciate Dr. Joe Vitale, but this time I have reached a conclusion that this book is merely a marketing trick. I think I know what I am speaking of, havinv read almost 200 books on this subject.<br />There is really no reason to buy this particular book. This is little bit like downloading a demo version of the full software product. You can test it, but very soon you will notice it has its limits..and all those functions you are really interested in are missing.<br />So instead of buying this particular book, go with Darel Rutherford's &quot;Being The Solution&quot; or Joe Vitale's other products.<br />Each chapter in the book does cover some interesting things, but after finishing reading this book I felt like &quot;what's the purpose of old good Joe to write this book?&quot; If he wanted to really help people, he would have dwelled in each subject more throughly, but this book leaves more questions than gives answers.<br />With all due respect, I think Joe Vitale has potential for writing AWESOME books. This man knows how to write, he has so much to say, but this time he blew it. If I were a book publisher -- I would have never published this particular item. If you are completely new to spiritual living, then you might catch few new ideas. Otherwise the book is repeating only what you already know by having read any spiritual book.<br />Anyway.. it is not that much.. Do buy it if you feel compelled.. or ask a friend who has bought the book because Dr. Vitale added a comment that the book may be shared with your friends...	2004-01-27

The reason why I became interested in this book, in the first place, is the fact that it is a personal success story by a man who has seen the worst and the best. He knows how it feels to be in the lowest place, but he also knows how grand it feels to be the winner, a millionaire, a father and successful business man. <br />This alone convinced me that his book is something extraordinary, and I should listen to what he has got to say. After all, he is not theorizing, but speaking based on his own experiences.<br />This book, unlike so many other &quot;self-help&quot; books, is much fun to read. It does feel like you are in one-to-one discussion with the author himself. After all, I couldn't lay down the book once I started reading it. <br />The author also provides several wonderful workbook exercises that are designed to guide you on the right path. Doing these exercises will ensure the maximum benefit.<br />The only factor that was left out from this book is the importance of feelings in creating success. That is the reason why I only give it 4 starts instead of full 5 stars. <br />However, if you were to combine what this book teaches in what Darel Rutherford's &quot;Being the Solution&quot; teaches... I could promise that you will be successful. The success principle works with mathematical exactitude. There is no reason to sit back. Invest your money in these two books.<br />I shall meet you on the top! Good Luck!	2004-01-27

I have read the original It Works and met people have succesfully applied the principles out-pictured in this little, but very profound book. Don't let the small size of the book to fool you, this is without a doubt one of the best books available.<br />The reason why I like this book is the fact that it presents an easy concept that anyone can follow -- and beat the odds, negative feelings and self-doubts. Certainly worth the few bucks.<br />The key to success is simple, and this book proves it. However, I would recommend two books to be read along this one. One of them is Being The Solution and the other is Immortal Man.	2004-01-11

We have yet to see what this man's remarkable contribution will accomplish in the future to come. <br />I don't usually like biographies, but this book is a great exception to this rule. It is written in a very beautiful way about man who discovered that there is divine power/force within everyone of us... he turned this knowledge into a religious science movement which is currently perhaps the most known division of New Thought movement.<br />The author of this book has a way of nailing your eyes to the book, and you cannot lay it down until you have finished. The author will walk you through the good and bad, joys and sorrows...and will show you how Ernest stood erect for the truth and did not waiver or give up even when met with resistance. So the book tells you a story of man who knew what needed to be done and then did it.<br />Ernest's sincere desire was to help his fellow human beings to lead a balanced life spiritually, socially, occupationally and financially. He wrote many great books which have changed lives of millions.<br />In my opinion, the best thing that this book accomplishes is that it will enlighten your understanding of what Religious Science is truly all about. If you have any uncertainities or feel like Religious Science is a shady movement, then reading this book will show you how much love and good things there are about the father of this organization.<br />The best biography I have ever read...written by a person who is Ernest's associate and a long-time friend.	2003-08-22

I have been interested in Neville's material for past two years or so. I read his books and lectures daily and can honestly verify that he is a very outstanding teacher, mystic and Bible scholar. According to some people, Neville is going to be one of three people remembered for their achievements in this world.<br />What makes Neville's lectures such great source of information is that this man devoted most of his life (over 40 years) for studying the deeper and inner meaning of sacred writings and he knew everything there is to know about the life. Not just that, but he had a very wonderful way of incorporating his knowledge and understanding into practical everyday guidelines and suggestions that will help you if you try them.<br />Neville never speculated with things - he spoke of personal experience and understanding of life. He says again and again that we should put his material into a test and it will prove to be the truth.<br />This book is a collection of transcribed lectures from later years of his life. Due to its highly spiritual and mystical nature, this book is recommended to advanced students of spiritual life. Eventhough Neville always wrote clearly and so that he be udnerstood, this book is not for everyone. If you are new to Neville material, I should suggest you read his book &quot;The Law and The Promise&quot; which serves as a wonderful introduction and helps you to understand what he is speaking of in this volume.<br />Naturally -- I would like to see more bible scholars to read this book because so much of the Bible's meaning and message has been misunderstood... This book should be found in any New Thought student's library.<br />Great Master Piece. Absolutely Lovely.	2003-03-10

Haanel was a successful business man who discovered that spiritual life is a key to success in everything you do. He proved that what is happening outside is in a direct relation to what is taking place in your consciousness.<br />When the Master Key was published, it was one of those books that successful business men wanted out of the market. They didn't want people to read this book as its truths would help anyone to overcome limitations.<br />The rumor is that when Bill Gates was just a student, he read this book and utilized its truths. Rest is history. <br />I have read this book - it is divided in chapters that have introductions and numbered paragraphs to study. It starts from understanding the principles of your conscious mind and its power and advances to utilizing these principles.<br />As you put in use what the author explains in this volume, you will start seeing substantial changes in your reality. In many ways, Charles was so much ahead of his time. Even today most profilic business coaches such as Antohony Robbins etc. do not admit the fact that your life is in your control 100%. We are taught that we are at the mercy of externals, but it ain't so.<br />In many ways, Charles F. Haanel is the most outstanding business coach there has ever been. Way before current business coaches who incorporate spiritual life and business, he did it. If you are an owner of major company -- have every employee of your company to read this book and utilize it in their daily routines. Your company will become the new success story. That is for sure.<br />Why am I giving just 4 stars for such an outstanding book? Well that is because the volume is rather long. I think the central message of this book could have been condensed into 60 pages -- but instead the author goes on and on for several hundred pages. On the other hand -- this does ensure that everyone grasps the principles involved in creating success.<br />Does it work? Yes it does. Why do some peoplefail? Well, they just read this book but don't put in use its truths. For some it is difficult to understand or believe that your life is just a mirror that is telling you what you are in your consciousness. Think you have a problem, and one will surface. Think you have a solution and it is as well yours. Fair game.	2003-03-10

I study Neville's material daily and can honestly verify that he is a very outstanding teacher, mystic and Bible scholar. In this volume that is Neville's first and perhaps most mystical book, he explains the meaning of different biblical events. <br />The book consists of rather short chapters. Each chapter is devoted to a certain biblical theme which Neville takes into discussion. Then he will proceed to explain you the spiritual and psychological truths that the theme includes. <br />This book is about spiritual awakening and understanding the power of your consciousness... not so much about self-help as self-help is generally understood as get-rich quickly scheme.<br />If you are looking for get-rich-quick books -- this title is not for you. However, if you seek to understand the deeper meaning of the Bible - this is a book to buy. <br />If you think you know your Bible, I challenge you to buy this book for your perception is going to change as a result of reading this book.<br />Very informative.	2003-03-10

It is small by its size, so it is easy to carry with you, even in your pocket -- but yet it has a very empowering message that you can contemplate and read as you have a spare moment.<br />For Advanced Truth seeker who is interested in metaphysics and self-help this book won't offer much new -- but it is a good gift for those who are lost in the wilderness of life and are open for new tools of mind to change things for better.<br />The best portition of this book is the interview with Jason Andrews -- which clearly explains what can be expected of your life once you master the principles of being a Super Being.<br />Along this book, you could read Darel Rutherford's Being The Solution which will continue from where this book ends.	2003-03-10

Not just your physical wounds, but also those inner problems that slow down your own progress toward success.<br />Dr. Murphy has written many great books, but this could be a bit better.

Here we have a wonderful book by one of the most successful law-enforcement officers in the entire world. Chief Gates became known around the world as a founder of a first SWAT team, as someone who initiated an International DARE program, and did so much for his department. His career is a good proof of that almost everything is possible in your life.<br />Gates gives in his book a realistic account of what it is to be a police officer on the street, what it is to feel the pressure from &quot;upstairs&quot;, and he also gives negative feedback so realistically that I felt like I had been standing next to him while he was explaining things.<br />This book is absolutely wonderful, and as a someone who plans to become a law-enforcement officer -- it is MUST! Gates has written a book of the time. It is very informative and covers all the major turns on his career including WATTS riots, 1982 Olympic Games, and Rodney King case.<br />Thank You Chief for writing such a nice account on your life!	2001-01-12

As usual, Dr. Murphy does repeat himself in different chapters, but it actually supports the theme of this book, and makes sure that a reader has understood everything.<br />Also, this book makes great reading before you retire at night. Pick up randomly a chapter, and read it.

Wayne W. Dyer is the first motivational Author whose book I read years ago. I visited a small second hand bookstore in San Francisco and his book &quot;Real Magic&quot; fell down from the shelf, I bought it, and it literally transformed my entire life into a new adventure.<br />With his help, a high school student became a successful young man with a promising future. Ever since I have met miracles and real magic in my life day by day... and with his help I have been able to achieve wonderful results.<br />However, I am deeply disappointed at Wayne's book &quot;9 spiritual principles&quot;. This book is the worst title by author who could write ten times better books.<br />This book is first of all written by confusing concept. Second, it does not really give you anything new if you have read his book Real Magic.<br />Third, this book rumbles over number of subjects, and it sounds rather unstable concept -- eventhough I know these principles do work.<br />After all, I lost all my excitement to read this book when I was in page 30, I laid down the book...and didn't read it for months.. Then I found it again, read it through twice, but still didn't like it too much.<br />You will do yourself a favor if you leave this title to those who are not familiar with spiritual laws.<br />IF YOU really want to read a good book, buy Real Magic by Dr. Wayne W. Dyer. In my opinion, Real Magic is Wayne's greatest book and this is the worst.<br />Wayne -- I really love your books...but this time I have to admit that I am not very happy with these 9 spiritual laws. This book might be a wonderful one if it would have 50 pages less, and it would be more like Deepak Chopra's 7 spiritual success laws or something.<br />After my second reading I was pretty sure that this book is nothing new. It is like 3 or 4 of his older books combined in one with not so good result.<br />If you still want to buy this book...go ahead, maybe it will please you more and resonate with you more than it did with me.	2000-12-23

Like his previous books, the aim of this one is to introduce God himself to you, and God will explain how you can experience a wonderful and happy communion with God himself.<br />This book requires from its reader open-mindedness and readiness to see beyond the old and very faulty concepts of God. After reading this book you will understand why there is no hell, no<br />devil or why God does not judge.<br />This book also explains great illusions and how to overcome them. Illusions such as Fear, Disunity and Conditionality. <br />I have many dreams, and goals. Traditional church has not been able to answer my many questions concerning God, but Neale Donald Walsch has done awesome job.<br />This book will basically give you tools to transform your life into a grander adventure which will cause you to rejoice and be happy. <br />If you are looking for a way to make your mind about God, this book is certainly for you!<br />I have already had some very wonderful experiences with this book. Even a few mystical ones.. and it is such an amazing thing!<br />I know that my dream of moving to the States, studying and working there is one thing that God has inspired me to consider.

In my opinion, this book is very practical and teaches you to understand the nature of psychical world beyond your senses.<br />The style is very similar and comparable to his other books, and there are number of good examples and techniques enabling you to activate your psychical senses.<br />The reason I give this book only 4 stars is that Dr. Murphy could have included more instructions instead of having so many testimonies. After I had read the book, I felt like there could have been more practical exercises or something that could support a reader to train his psychic muscles.<br />If you are familiar with New Thought already, this book will do so much good for you. However, if this is your first Murphy book, then I suggest you to read some of his basic books such as &quot;The Power of Your Subconscious Mind&quot; or &quot;The Amazing Laws of Cosmic Mind Power&quot;.<br />As you combine these three books together, you will get a powerful tol to create a life of your dreams.<br />I recommend this book for advanced students of truth and who are familiar with Murphy's other titles.	2000-11-03
