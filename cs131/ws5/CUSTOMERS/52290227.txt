For the most part, it won't. Instead, what you'll find is a large collection of puzzles and their answers - but very little discussion of the PROCESS of solving brainteasers. Unless your plan is to memorize the contents of this book, and hope that an interviewer's question matches one of your canned answers, you won't find much value here. <br /> <br />Much of what's in Kador's book can also be found here: <br /> <br />\\"How Would You Move Mount Fuji: Microsoft's Cult of the Puzzle\\" by William Poundstone <br /> <br />Specifically for software developer interviews, this is also helpful: <br /> <br />\\"Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job\\" by John Mongan <br /> <br />Just a hint: Canned answers seldom fool capable interviewers. Your time would be better spent mastering the actual techniques of problem solving, rather than trying to memorize things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-20

The author does a good job of maintaining just the right balance between math and intuition. For someone just starting out, this book is a good choice. It will lay a firm foundation for later, more rigorous studies. <br /> <br />One negative comment: This volume appears to have been published by the author's own (tiny) publishing company. The book's quality would have been improved if the author/publisher had engaged the services of a proof reader and editor. Some of the word usage is just wrong, and commas are scattered about more or less randomly in the text. While this doesn't detract from the quality of the information, it's a distraction. <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

I'm afraid I'm in the \\"save your money\\" group of reviews.  <br /> <br />It's true that the author provides a fair amount of historical context for the C language -- but you need to ask yourself, does that information really make the reader a better C-language programmer? I would argue that it doesn't. <br /> <br />The author's lengthy explanation of the mysteries of type declaration is useful, but it's probably not worth the price of the book. <br /> <br />The value of the book is further reduced by the vast number of tongue-in-cheek, shaggy dog stories the author includes. What exactly was the point of spending several pages describing the results of running two copies of the Eliza/Doctor program?  <br /> <br />(I suppose if I were invited to a cocktail party given by geeks, then this little volume would actually be useful -- it would provide a world of conversational tidbits and trivia I could use to impress the other guests.) <br /> <br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the author also seems to offer a lot of opinions about how to write good C, with nothing but his own opinion to back him up. <br /> <br />If you really want to become a C-language expert, get a copy of Harbison and Steele, and something like \\"C Traps and Pitfalls.\\" And do a lot of coding. <br />  <br />	2005-07-13

Leaving out the appendices (which contain nothing but source code) and the less-than-useless clip art, the book barely scrapes past 100 pages. There are a few exceptional technical books that manage to squeeze a whole universe of information into a small number of pages; this isn't one of them. <br /> <br />The author doesn't seem to be very clear about who his audience is. At one end of the spectrum, he goes into great detail about the historical origins of abstract data types; he also takes pains to explain that FORTRAN is used primarily for scientific computing, while COBOL is a business language. The assumption seems to be that his readers have never seen a computer. Then in his discussion of design patterns, he glosess over a lot of foundational concepts that a novice would need. Now, all at once, his readers are experienced designers who only need a summary to get them started. <br /> <br />Finally, there are the block quotations from Christopher Alexander that start every chapter. They seem to be there mostly to take up space on the page.  <br /> <br />For beginners trying to get a handle on design patterns, I would recommend Shalloway's \\"Design Patterns Explained\\" instead of this book.	2005-07-08

Characters printed in smaller font sizes have a tendency to fill in with ink, so that digits like \\"8\\" or letters like \\"d\\" tend to be nothing but little blobs. (\\"Vcc\\" tends to look like \\"V**\\".) The manufacturers' datasheets in the back of the book are nearly unreadable. (\\"1*00 -- is that number 1500, 1600, 1900 ?\\") Even in parts of the book printed in larger type, the effect of the edge-bleed is to make reading a painful experience.<br /><br />So, I am returning the book to Amazon. Based on Mr. Lopez's comments this is clearly not an isolated case of a bad print run. I don't believe (as Mr. Jung implies) that the Lopez review is based on some kind of illegal photocopy.<br /><br />I've owned both of the previous editions of Mr. Jung's fine book on op amps, and I've very disappointed in what the publisher has done to the third edition.

The authors seem to do fine with \\"big picture\\" generalizations, but when it comes to the particulars -- watch out! This problem seems most obvious when they try to talk about the features of real-world CPUs, such as the x86 family. For example, they made a couple statements about Pentium memory management that left me wondering if they had ever read the Intel documentation. In general, their real-world examples seemed to be something that they stuck into the book in order to make it \\"more relevant.\\"  <br /> <br />So, I guess it's back to Patterson, et al. <br /> <br />	2004-12-08

The whole first chapter of this book is a piece of low-grade Gibsonesque cyber-punk. The only thing missing is a reference to an Ono-Sendai &quot;Samurai VII&quot; cyber-deck.

While it does an excellent job of presenting and analyzing the THEORY of various kinds of probability models, it says almost nothing about how to apply these models to the problems of computer science. For example queueing theory is incredibly useful in many areas of performance modeling, but Ross doesn't mention any of them. Instead, he presents queueing theory as if it fell from the sky one day -- pristine and beautiful, not to be tarnished by having any actual purpose. The presentation reminds me of the way some &quot;pure&quot; mathematicians take offense when a physicist even hints that their beautiful equations might be used to solve an actual problem. If you're interested in applying this stuff, take a look instead at Trivedi's &quot;Probability and Statistics with Reliability, Queueing, and Computer Science Applications, 2nd Edition.&quot; It's a much better book.	2004-02-21

Pros:<br />Beginners are often overhelmed by the vast array of astrological predictive techniques. Ms. Rushman does a good job of presenting a coherent system that beginners can use to manage all the information.<br />Cons:<br />* On a superficial level, this book is just badly written and edited. There are all sorts of language errors that could easily have been picked up by the grammar checker of a decent word-processing program. My favorite was the paragraph that simply ended with a comma,<br />* Less superficially, a good editor could have helped Ms.Rushman to organize and tighten up her presentation a bit. She has a tendency to get caught in anecdotal stories and ramble, making it difficult to hold on to the thread of her presentation.<br />* Sadly, Ms.Rushman espouses the mistaken notion that a sign, a planet, and a house are all roughly the same thing. This is basically the old twelve-letter astroglogical alphabet first proposed (I believe) by Zip Dobyns, and it goes against literally hundreds of years of astrological practice.<br />For example, this system would have you believe that the Moon combined with ANY &quot;letter-10&quot; element (Capricorn, Saturn, 10th house) produces roughly the same result -- which is clearly not true.<br />  - Moon in the 10th: Your career involves the public.<br />  - Moon in Capricorn: You're painfully shy, or perhaps<br />  you just like living in the mountains.<br />  - Moon conjunct Saturn: Your mother was an ice cube...<br />So, all in all, an okay book if you need help organizing all the data used in prediction, but not a great source of information about astrological interpretation.	2002-02-14

It tries to cover far too much territory in too few pages.<br />The author's C++ &quot;framework&quot; class for NT services makes some extremely naive assumptions, particulary with regard to processing SCM control messages. (See John Bell's article in the August 1998 C/C++ User's Journal for a much better C++ service framework.) <br />This book is not a good place to learn about service programming from scratch; and if you already know the basics, this book has nothing new to tell you.	2001-12-30
