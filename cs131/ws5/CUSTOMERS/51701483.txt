History records that in March 1968, President Johnson, succumbing to mounting pressures from the war in Vietnam, declined to stand for re-election.  But Johnson may have had more than Vietnam on his mind.  Earlier that fateful month, a nuclear-armed Soviet Golf-II submarine sank just 350 miles from Hawaii. <br /> <br />What the sub was doing there and how it met its demise may never be proven definitively.  But author Kenneth Sewell presents a convincing case -- though one not without caveat, conjecture and speculation -- that the sub was a rogue executing a furtive mission to provoke a nuclear exchange between the U.S. and China.  As Sewell presents it, the KGB commandeered the sub, K-129, with the intention of delivering a nuclear strike on Pearl Harbor.  The audacious plan -- masterminded by KGB Boss Yuri Andropov and his mentor, Mikhail Suslov -- would be executed in a way that pointed responsibility at China, capitalizing on growing U.S. fears of a bellicose Mao Zedong.  A U.S.-developed fail-safe mechanism, designed to prevent an unauthorized missile launch, is all the prevented the sinister plan from succeeding.  The Johnson Administration had shared the fail-safe technology with Moscow only a couple of years before the incident.  Instead of incinerating Pearl and a good part of Oahu, the nuclear missile destroyed the K-129, sending all 98 crewmen to their final resting place at the bottom of the Pacific.   <br /> <br />Sewell relates at length the K-129 incident's diplomatic impact -- he speculates that it facilitated both Nixon's detente with the Soviets and his rapprochement with the Chinese -- as well as elaborate CIA efforts to recover the enemy sub (in violation of international law) and to keep the truth about the renegade sub's motives from ever being revealed. <br /> <br />I don't go in much for conspiracy theories. And a casual reader has no way of knowing how much of Sewell's tale is truth and how much is fiction.  But the case he makes certainly sounds plausible - or at least possible.   <br />	2005-09-18
US	51701483	R2TRFIG9G1MVNA	0375509100	813776641	The Cold War: A Military History	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Treasure Trove of Cold War Experiences	This is a fascinating anthology of essays, a rich treasure trove of Cold War experiences told by leading historians.  Some events chronicled here are well known -- the Berlin Airlift, Cuban Missile Crisis, Truman's cashiering of MacArthur, Dien Bien Phu, etc. -- while others this reader learned about for the first time. For example, an uprising of North Korean and Chinese POWs at Koje-do; the Chinese Communist assault on the British frigate Amethyst in 1949, or CIA efforts -- soon compromised -- to tap Soviet telephone lines by digging a tunnel in East Berlin. <br /> <br />The collection of 27 essays begins with the 1946 showdown with the Soviets over their ambitions in Turkey. James Chace contends the Cold War started on August 19 of that year, when Truman sent a naval task force to Istanbul in response to Stalin's attempt to establish naval bases in the Dardanelles Strait.  In the final essay, Williamson Murray examines Soviet military planners' strategy for invading central Europe, which came to light after the Berlin Wall's collapse.  Instead of sending their tanks through the Fulda Gap and into West Germany, as widely anticipated, Soviet planners envisioned unleashing 300 to 400 nuclear missiles on Western Europe as a prelude to a ground assault.  Only the prospect of massive nuclear retaliation from the U.S., Murray says, dissuaded the Kremlin from acting on its generals' invasion plans. <br /> <br />Readers will draw their own conclusions about which essays are the most intriguing.  Personally, I especially liked Tom Fleming's account of Matthew Ridgway Herculean efforts to turn the tide in North Korea, and Victor Davis Hanson's \\"revisionist\\" account of Curtis LeMay's career and contributions.  <br /> <br />Whatever your personal preference, this anthology will prove satisfying for any reader with an interest in recent American history.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-11

Stephen Walker transports us back to the summer of 1945, when the country's $2 billion+ investment in nuclear weaponry - and its gambit to shorten the war - faced its decisive moment of truth. <br /> <br />Walker recounts the extraordinary secrecy that cloaked the Manhattan Project - military personnel thought to be security risks were summarily dispatched to guard duty in Alaska -- and the enormous pressures on men like Oppenheimer and General Groves to make it succeed. Oppenheimer was so pessimistic that he was actually betting that the New Mexico test firing would fail, and, at one point, was banned from the testing site so that his negative energy would not affect other scientists.  We see an emboldened Pres. Truman at Potsdam \\"bossing around\\" a phlegmatic Stalin, who knew more about the U.S.'s \\"secret\\" weapon than he let on thanks to the espionage of the notorious Klaus Fuchs.   Japan foreign ministry peace overtures through the Soviets run into a diplomatic cul de sac when Truman insists on unconditional surrender, and Stalin opts instead to declare war on Japan and stream his forces into Manchuria. <br /> <br />Despite the protestations of some in the scientific community - including Leo Szilard, \\"the father of the bomb\\" - Truman and his advisors never doubt their decision to target a Japanese population center - without warning or demonstration.  (Only War Secretary Stimson has some qualms, but he doesn't express them very forcefully.) It's just \\"not a decision to worry about,\\" Truman says, famously. <br /> <br />Certainly, Paul Tibbets and the Enola Gay crew don't have any reservations about the mission they're asked to perform. And Walker captures their harrowing, tension-filled ride from Tinian Island to Hiroshima in vivid detail.  Given the weight of their payload, it's not certain Enola Gay will even make it off the ground, let alone survive a scamper across the Pacific or the sprouting, six-mile-high mushroom cloud. <br /> <br />Still, the reader cannot help but be moved by Walker's graphic accounts of Hiroshima's widespread devastation, and the heart-rending experiences of a local populace caught completely unaware.  A doctor called out of the city on a post-midnight emergency is one of the few medical professionals to survive (his medical center lost 85% of its nurses and doctors).  An adolescent girl perseveres only through the good graces of her teacher, while a young conscript returns home to collect the bones of his wife and infant daughter. <br /> <br />Sixty years on from the event, \\"Shockwave\\" had me spellbound from cover to cover - an enthralling, captivating, engrossing read.    <br />	2005-08-13

Bevin Alexander argues persuasively that the U.S.'s bold initiatives in Iraq, Afghanistan and other theaters of the War on Terror are deeply rooted in the American experience. As it did in WW II, Alexander says, America is proving that it will go anywhere to defeat evil.  Bush's assertion that the U.S. will never seek an international \\"permission slip\\" to defend our interests has its antecedents in the Senate's rejection of Wilson's League of Nations, which, Alexander says, represented a dangerous ceding of American sovereignty. <br /> <br />This is not a partisan tract; it's a history with practical application for today' situation. Alexander criticizes American administrations past and present for mistakes or indecision.  But, he points out, on the overarching issues of foreign and military policy the U.S. has been right more often than not. <br />	2005-07-24

Convention of 1940 and How It Freed FDR to Save the Western World	Books	5	40	42	N	N	Opposition in Wartime	Political mavens will recall Zell Miller's praise for Wendell Willkie at last summer's Republican Convention.  Charles Peters provides the back story on Willkie's principled support for FDR's wartime initiatives during the 1940 election season. <br /> <br />Peters recounts how Willkie - the only internationalist in a field of avowed isolationists -- wrested the Republican nod from the grip of Dewey, Taft and Vandenberg, each of whom was implacably opposed to providing material assistance to the Allies as the Nazi juggernaut marched across Europe.  France's astonishing capitulation the day before the Convention opened was the biggest factor, Peters avers, in galvanizing popular and delegate support behind Willkie - though it took six ballots to put him over the top.  He also details the role of the Luce media empire and a sympathetic press generally, Wall Street and Eastern Establishment interests, and a grassroots campaign orchestrated by Elihu Root's (former Sec of State) grandson played in advancing Willkie's Darkhorse candidacy. <br /> <br />We also see the always-politically-dexterous FDR orchestrating a putative \\"draft\\" at the Democratic convention in Chicago, thereby sparing himself the indignity of having to actively seek an unprecedented third term.  The nip-and-tuck struggle to add Henry Wallace to the ticket as VP is also recalled in fascinating detail.  (Wallace's principal opponent was the father of actress Tallulah Bankhead, then the Speaker of the House, who would be dead less than 60 days after the convention.) <br /> <br />Confronting FDR as he secured re-nomination were two politically treacherous issues borne out of the hostilities in Europe:  whether to provide England with 50 WWI vintage destroyers for its desperately depleted fleet, and whether to institute a military draft, the first for the U.S. in peacetime.   Wilkie's support for universal conscription was unflagging throughout the campaign, pretty remarkable considering the fervent, visceral opposition this issue engendered among Republican regulars, not to mention legions of concerned American mothers. (Remember at this time, Pearl Harbor was still over a year away and isolationist sentiment was in the majority.)   On FDR's exchange of the aged destroyers for U.S. basing rights in the Caribbean - a sound bargain for Uncle Sam - Willkie did not gainsay the decision.  But he did loudly excoriate FDR's decision to end-run Congress (bipartisan opposition assured the plan' defeat) and implement it by executive order.  After the hard-fought election, Willkie was an ardent supporter of FDR's Lend-Lease initiative, his Congressional testimony credited with providing the margin of difference. <br /> <br />\\"Five Days in Philadelphia\\" is an interesting look at how the loyal opposition should behave in wartime - an engaging, illuminating and all-around terrific read.  <br />	2005-07-10

It provides a good retrospective on the Giuliani Era in New York. In a generally favorable examination, noted historian Fred Siegel shows the outsized impact that Rudy had on Gotham's politics and public policy.  Not just the well chronicled successes -- the historic, national-pace-setting drop in crime, and his inspired leadership during and after 9/11.  But also less frequently recalled achievements like the restoration of basic academic standards at CUNY, fiscal prudence (without resort to tax increases) during a pronounced regional recession, welfare reform, etc.  The missteps are also covered in detail, including the tragic Diallo shooting, ill-considered 1999 City Charter reform plan, and the very public dissolution of Rudy's marriage.   <br /> <br />Siegel has effusive praise for Rudy's prescience in anticipating, and preparing the City for, another terrorist attack after the first WTC bombing. Giuliani saw a link between the 1990 Meir Kahane assassination and the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center and knew the terrorist threat was real and on-going. His crisis management plans, while no panacea, paid dividends in the City's response to 9/11.  <br /> <br />On the political front, Giuliani's endorsement sealed the election for Bloomberg in 2001.  But a more telling measure of his influence that election year was the extent to which a longtime foe and career Naderite like Mark Green adopted much of Rudy's agenda.  Giuliani bequeathed to Bloomberg a City whose economy was deeply wounded by 9/11 and the post-bubble recession on Wall Street, but that was in fundamentally better shape than Giuliani himself inherited in 1994.  Still, Bloomberg's failure to meaningfully curb spending, imposition of tax increases and generally more paternalistic approach to governance signaled the end of the Giuliani Era in New York. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed this book a great deal, I deducted one star from my rating due to an inordinate number of typos and several careless mistakes.  For example, Browning Ferris Industries, the national waste management behemoth, is repeatedly referred to as \\"Brown & Ferris.\\" <br />	2005-06-12

But Reagan's eloquent paeans to the World War II generation at Normandy in `84 certainly merit the treatment historian Douglas Brinkley has provided here. <br /> <br />Along with his Challenger Disaster and Berlin Wall remarks, the \\"Boys of Pointe du Hoc\\" tribute is the Great Communicator's most famous, poignant and moving oratory.  Brinkley provides a behind-the-scenes look into how the Pointe du Hoc speech - as well as the equally powerful D-Day remembrance delivered on Omaha Beach - came into being.   <br /> <br />No statesman of our time could deliver a line or a story like Ronald Reagan.  But Reagan had a big assist from his masterful speechwriters - Peggy Noonan (Pointe du Hoc) and Tony Dolan (Omaha Beach) - who crafted elegant prose and vivid imagery, often overcoming \\"practical\\" objections from State and NSC staffers.  Noonan, especially, intuited that Reagan was at his best when he related stories about real people and spoke directly his audience.  So she has Reagan addressing his stirring tribute directly to the Army Rangers assembled in the front row, an emotional formulation that brought French President Mitterrand (whom Brinkley calls \\"one of the original stone faces\\") to near tears. <br /> <br />Likewise, Dolan forms his Omaha Beach narrative around a young woman's testimonial to her late father, a D-Day survivor who never realized his ambition to someday return with his family to Normandy's shores.  The woman, Lisa Zanatta Henn, exchanged friendly letters with Reagan for several years after their meeting at Normandy, and she maintains adoration for Reagan to this day. <br /> <br />The D-Day anniversary speeches were integral, Brinkley says, in kindling a New Patriotism across America, and touched off renewed veneration of World War II veterans - the Ambrose books, Brokaw's Greatest Generation, \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" etc -- thatcontinues to this day.  Restoring American pride and native optimism, Reagan knew, were keys to exorcising post-Vietnam defeatism and bringing a successful end to the Cold War.   \\"Reagan knew the best way to roll back Woodstock nation,\\" Brinkley writes, \\"was to trump it with Normandy nation.\\" <br />	2005-06-05

Wake Island's stalwart defenders forsaken like at a modern Alamo.  The Philippine garrison under siege.  German U-boats menacing Atlantic shipping lanes.    Trying times, indeed, at the outset of America's involvement in World War II.  \\"1942\\" is Winston Groom's brilliant, often lyrical, account of America's desperate struggle to overcome years of un-preparedness and underestimation of the enemy, and to turn the tide against the Axis powers.       The book, by definition, is primarily (though not exclusively) focused on the Pacific War, and Groom eloquently re-tells the epic battles that halted the Japanese offensive on the threshold of Australia: Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, New Guinea, etc.         It abounds with colorful anecdotes of individual heroism: Claire \\"High Pockets\\" Phillips, a Manila nightclub impresario who risked her life to deliver food and medicines to starving prisoners at the infamous Cabanatuan prison camp.  A young American woman known as \\"Cynthia,\\" who literally bared all to help procure the Vichy naval codes prior to Operation Torch.  Columbus Darwin Smith, the first American captured by the Japanese, who escaped from captivity and survived a harrowing, 700-mile trek through Japanese-held China.  The famous Doolittle raid, Bataan Death March, etc., etc.    Groom is not the first to recount these events.  But he has an unsurpassed gift for storytelling and a writing style that produces an engaging, highly accessible narrative.  Even readers who loathed high school history will find this book irresistible.  Five stars all around.	2005-06-04

The dual narrative focuses primarily on the titanic, four-way struggle for Gracie Mansion involving Koch, Cuomo, the incumbent Abe Beame and Bella Abzug, as well as the incendiary Steinbrenner-Martin-Jackson triangle of animus in the Bronx.    The sweltering summer of 1977 also featured the Son of Sam serial murders and power-failure-induced rioting - the City's worst civic disorder since the Civil War - and Mahler skillfully weaves these compelling events into a captivating, past-faced narrative.  Ground-zero of the rioting was the Bushwick section of Brooklyn - less than a decade before a stable, working class neighborhood - and Mahler provides a vivid portrait of the chaotic mayhem that took hold there (as well as in other poor communities) when the lights went out on July 13.    Mahler also shows how the ghetto rioting transformed the Mayoral race.  In mid summer, Ed Koch, then a relatively low profile Congressman, was fourth in the polls, mired in the low single digits. However, the erstwhile Greenwich Village liberal recognized that New Yorkers were ripe for a stern, law-and-order message. In particular, Koch's embrace of capital punishment and his get-tough policies generally found resonance with an electorate that had grown weary of the culture of lawlessness that increasingly pervaded their lives.  The long-shot candidate - David Garth, his campaign guru, placed Koch's odds at no better than 40 to 1 - rode voter outrage to a first-place finish in the Democratic primary, and after besting Cuomo in a runoff, to City Hall.     Meanwhile, up in the Bronx, the season-long hostilities between the egocentric Reggie Jackson and his combative manager flared famously in an ugly confrontation in the visitor's dugout at Fenway Park.  Steinbrenner sided with his million-dollar superstar (Mahler calls Jackson New York's first black superstar; I'm not so sure), the fans overwhelmingly with the pugnacious Martin.  Despite the team's success, the melodrama off the field eclipsed the drama on the field for much of the season - until Jackson's prodigious, three-homer performance in the last game of the World Series.  Mr. October's Ruthian feat helped the Yanks capture their first world championship in 12 years and set everything right - at least until next season.     I am a compulsive reader, but found this book especially addictive.  I think you will, too.	2005-05-01

The authors detail the history of religious conflict in Lebanon, the birth of Hezbollah out of the early 1980s Lebanon Civil War, and the role of the Iranian government in financing and facilitating Hezbollah's illicit deeds.  They review well chronicled tales of Hezbollah terrorist attacks on US interests abroad - most famously, the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks bombing and the Kohbar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in 1996 - and against Israel.  They also tell us a great deal about Hezbollah's extensive operations in South America's lawless Tri-Border Region (the area bordering Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil) and its deadly attacks on the Israeli embassy (1992) and a Jewish community center (1994) in Buenos Aires.  The experience in Argentina, the authors say, illustrates how Hezbollah operatives infiltrate a foreign country and establish support cells that can be activated with lethal effect whenever the leaders in Lebanon or their Iranian sponsors deem it in their interests. <br /> <br />In the U.S., the authors focus on Hezbollah support cells in Charlotte, NC and Dearborn, MI, although they identify at least 14 US cities where the terrorist organization is known to be active.  The support cells engage in various criminal enterprises to raise funds for Hezbollah.  In Charlotte, the illicit activity of choice was smuggling cigarettes into parts of Michigan in order to avoid heavy local sales taxes. This cost Michigan taxpayers some $3.7 million in lost tax revenue, much of which found its way to Hezbollah's coffers in Lebanon. In order to break up the nefarious ring, the authors show how the FBI, ATF and local law enforcement officials had to overcome ill-considered Federal laws strictly limiting cooperation between intelligence and criminal branches, and a timid, don't-rock-the-boat mentality that held sway prior to September 11th. The so-called \\"Chinese Wall\\" erected by Congress in 1978 and reinforced and heightened by Janet Reno's Deputy Jamie Gorelick (later a 9/11 Commission member) comes in for stinging criticism. <br /> <br />This book is especially timely now with the Cedar Revolution unfolding in Lebanon and Hezbollah vying for political legitimacy and international recognition.  It will provide any reader with a better understanding of one of the world's most lethal terror networks.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />     <br />	2005-04-23

Fastow is plainly a criminal who well deserved the punishment meted out to him.  By this account, Lay does appear to be largely ignorant of the wrongdoing going on around him.  For example, he's never heard of Michael Kopper, Fastow's co-conspirator.  It will be interesting to see how his trial plays out.  Skilling comes across as mentally unstable.  Did he resign abruptly because of foreknowledge of the criminal enterprise in Enron's midst?  This theory would tend to be undermined by his strenuous efforts -- rebuffed by the board of directors -- to return as CEO as the nascent scandal was unfolding. <br /> <br />It's good to see that Eichenwald dispelled some of the myths that have emerged surrounding Enron.  To wit: <br /> <br />*The \\"deregulation\\" of California's energy market.  Consumer rates were never deregulated, only wholesale rates.  Enron did exploit a poorly conceived system.  But the lack of true deregulation -- coupled with a politically timorous Governor -- caused the California energy crisis to persist. <br />*Sherron Watkins as a \\"whistleblower.\\"  Watkins was never a whistleblower in the true sense of the term.  She did write a memo and met with Lay to express her concerns.  But she never went to the authorities.  As Fastow was finally exposed and Enron went into crisis mode, she was primarily concerned about securing a position she thought worthy of her experience.  Nothing wrong with that; but she was not the selfless do-gooder Time magazines made her out to be. <br />*The \\"freezing\\" of employee 401K accounts.  Employees were unable to move 401K monies out of Enron stock due to a routine change of administrators announced well in advance.  The lockout lasted three days and the stock price decline over this period was fairly muted.  Employees were net buyers of Enron stock when the lockout period ended. <br /> <br />It's also notable that Enron received some of its best advice from its PR advisers.   The first impulse of any institution under siege is to blame the media for its woes -- certainly Lay and some board members exhibited this tendency.  Meanwhile, the PR staff counseled the executives to Acknowledge, Apologize and Act, and later, to retain a former SEC enforcement director to conduct a thoroughgoing internal investigation.  <br />	2005-04-17

The U.S. military's widely hailed success in running joint operations certainly was not evident during Operation Anaconda, a failure that Sean Naylor captures in vivid, searing detail.    Operation Anaconda, as depicted by Naylor, is warfare at it most egregious, a large engagement beset by a veritable comedy of errors.  The result was the needless loss of American life and a missed opportunity to snare countless more Al Qaeda (including HVTs?) in the Shahikot Valley in March 2002.     I'd like to think (hope and pray!) that the Anaconda blunders are the exception, rather than the rule.  Ignorance about the strength and disposition of enemy forces; dependence on piecemeal, \\"adhocracy\\" in assembling an attacking force; discounting solid intelligence that does not conform with \\"The Plan;\\" abysmal inter-service communication and coordination; lack of artillery support.  The list could go on and on.    \\"Not a Good Day to Die\\" is a disturbing, unsettling book.	2005-04-03

I was just out of high school, and can vividly recall the national despair and exasperation over the hostage crisis.  In many ways, 1979-80 was the nadir of our post-Vietnam national funk.    Harris' book provides an excellent window on the hostage crisis, and the machinations in Washington and Tehran to resolve it. Harris portrays most Carterites in sympathetic terms (perhaps no surprise considering the author's leftist politics), especially Ham Jordan, whose secret, trans-continental diplomatic efforts had him functioning as a de facto Secretary of State. Brzezinski is cast in a much less flattering light, and is derided for his hawkish posture. It's interesting that Harris chose not to (or was unable to) interview Carter's National Security Advisor.  The diplomacy advocates Vance and Christopher come across as naive in their aversion to military force or coercion of any kind.    On the Iranian side, Bani Sadr (president) and Ghotbzadeh (foreign minister) are gullible in the extreme.  From their days together in exile in Paris, it is clear that Khomeini was using these moderates to mask his extremism and advance his legitimacy internationally.  The Shah (\\"His Imperial Majesty,\\" \\"Light of the Aryans,\\" etc) is venal and weak, although when the moment of truth arrived, he blanched at unleashing the Iron Fist to quell the rebellion.    UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim is untrustworthy and through arrogance, incompetence or both, did more than anyone to undermine the secret Jordan-Ghotbzadeh agreement to spring the hostages.     The book is a surprisingly brisk read, given the weightiness of the subject matter.  The author's decision to focus primarily on a small number of key players certainly helped speed the narrative pace.  But I was a little put off this technique. For example, the State Department official who participated in Jordan's diplomaticgambit is referred to repeatedly as \\"the Assistant Secretary of State\\" - no name, ever, is associated with him. I kept wondering who this mystery diplomat was.  Other characters are referred to generically as \\"the NSC official\\" or \\"State's Iran specialist.\\"    The author also errs in the epilogue when he asserts that Warren Christopher served as President Clinton's Secretary of State for eight years -- what about Madeleine Albright?   These mild criticisms aside, \\"The Crisis\\" is an excellent read and highly informative.    The Hostage Crisis was one of the more dismal episodes in recent American history. It helped to fell a sitting president, underscored the perception of American impotence and served as a capstone to the nation's decade-long diminishment on the world stage.	2005-03-13

Ronald Reagan had a similar transformational effect on the Republican Party.    Craig Shirley's new book illuminates a pivotal event in that process -- RR's hair's-breadth loss to Gerald Ford in '76.  Without the near-miss Ford challenge, Shirley asserts, Reagan is unlikely to have ever been elected President, and the nascent Conservative Movement, which today dominates the Republican Party, may never have achieved critical mass nationally.    Most observers trace the roots of the Conservative Movement to Goldwater's failed bid in '64.  But in the wake of Goldwater's shellacking, the national Republicans in the early '70s were still a genteel, neoliberal, \\"go-along-to-get-ahead\\" party, afflicted with intellectual lassitude, de-legitimized by Watergate and wallowing in permanent minority status.     It was Reagan and the band of fiery Conservative activists he attracted that shocked the Republican Party out of its torpor, and put it on the road to majority status.   And '76 was when Reagan's Conservatives captured the party's soul, despite failing to oust a sitting President who skillfully leveraged all the advantages of incumbency to gain the nomination.     Throughout history, most insurgent campaigns have failed utterly; Reagan's failed barely.  And Shirley recounts so many turns where the outcome could have been different: pulling out too soon in New Hampshire; almost capturing Wisconsin despite offering only token effort; failing to field a full delegate slate in Ohio, etc.  At the Kansas City convention, there was the perfidy of the Mississippi Chairman, Clarke Reed, who reneged on a promise to deliver the state's entire delegation to Reagan. And John Sears's often-second-guessed decision to pre-announce Reagan's  running mate, the moderate Richard Schweicker. (Shirley says opposition to the Pennsylvania Senator was intensified because some Conservative delegates confused him with his more liberal, Watergate-grandstanding colleague, Connecticut Senator Lowell Weicker.)        For me, Shirley's book also added critical insight into many aspects of the '76 campaign, such as the central role of Jesse Helms's forces in achieving victory for Reagan during the momentous North Carolina primary, which kept Reagan's flagging campaign alive.     Shirley's book is well researched and well crafted.   Political junkies, regardless of their affiliation, will be held in thrall from cover to cover.	2005-02-13
US	51701483	R2AVYWHKXV3ZE1	159071038X	64356943	Character: Profiles In Presidential Courage	Books	4	4	6	N	N	A Fun Book	\\"Fun\\" is the word I'd use to describe Chris Wallace's new book.  This certainly isn't scholarship, and anyone interested in that ought to look elsewhere.    It's a compilation of Presidential anecdotes -- some obscure (US Grant and the threat of war with Cuba; Grover Cleveland and the Pullman labor strike) and others well chronicled (Lincoln and The Emancipation Proclamation; Wilson and the League of Nations; FDR and Lend Lease).  Modern (i.e., Post WW II) stories account for six of the 16 chapters. Readers over 45 will vividly recall Nixon's China Card and Reagan's Zero Option.  And, GW Bush's Iraq War concludes Wallace's book.     For me, the Grant anecdote was the most revealing, and the subject I knew least about.  While Wallace credits Grant with skirting war, the narrative makes plain that Sec of State Hamilton Fish was responsible for the triumph of diplomacy.  (A Sec of State argues strenuously for diplomacy, while the War Sec lobbies hard for military action -- sound familiar?).  The story behind the Great Thomas Jefferson's maladroit imposition of the Embargo Acts was also enlightening.  But, it's hard to see how this episode merits inclusion since all the embargoes did was postpone the ultimate reckoning with Britain while unleashing economic misery.  I also have reservations about JFK's Bay of Pigs debacle.  Wallace argues that JFK learned from the incident and was more restrained during the subsequent Cuban missile crisis.  Still, I don't see how withholding promised air support for the anti-Castro insurgents being slaughtered on the beach reflects character or courage.    It's questions like these and others that make Wallace's book so fun. \\"Does Andrew Johnson's impeachment battle belong in a book about character?\\" \\"Were LBJ's lies about Vietnam -- however well intentioned -- truly acts of Presidential courage?\\" We could debate these questions for hours.     I do take issue with some rather glaring errors of fact.  As an earlier reviewer pointed out,associating the House Un-American Committee with Senator McCarthy is silly. And the claim that LBJ fought in the Pacific War is just plain wrong.  As Robert Caro has proven, LBJ spent most of WW II lounging on the West Coast, except for one near-death experience as an observer on a bombing raid.  LBJ's talent for embellishment and political connections inflated that one harrowing incident into a medal-winning war record.     A few factual errors aside, Wallace's book is an enjoyable read for anyone looking to broaden his/her knowledge of our past Presidents or U.S. history in general.	2005-01-22

In his Civil War, Mexican War and American Revolution novels, he tells the tales primarily through the eyes of the commanders.  Here, we again hear from the generals -- primarily Pershing, but also Foch, Haig, Petain and Ludendorf -- but Shaara also provides the voice of the people doing the frontline fighting -- and not necessarily the most legendary names, either.  There's no Alvin York, for example, and Eddie Rickenbacker makes a couple of cameos.  But by taking on the persona of private Roscoe Temple, Shaara is able to spotlight the U.S. Marines' searing baptism under fire at Belleau Wood.  And he vividly illuminates the air war through the Richthofen and Lufbery characters.   <br /> <br />One of the strengths of Shaara's novels (and a reason I like them so much) is his adamant loyalty to the historical record. Although the words and thoughts are invented, Shaara usually goes to pains not to change facts.  I guess he just got sloppy, then, with Billy Mitchell, the young, maverick air service trailblazer whom Shaara depicts as a 70-year-old man.  (A 70-year-old man who punches a pacifist in the mouth and who's put in charge of the U.S. air service?!?)  Shaara has Mitchell dying in 1936 at age 88 (he was 56 when he died). <br /> <br />I deducted one star from the overall rating due to the careless Mitchell gaffe.  \\"To the Last Man\\" is a five-star performance otherwise. <br />	2004-12-19

I've read a few books about the Battle of the Bulge, but nothing as personal or riveting as Kershaw's account of the I&R platoon of the 394 Infantry Regiment.  Nominally a recognizance unit, this platoon found itself inconveniently positioned in the five-mile gap in the Allied lines at the very moment that [...] launched his final, desperate offensive in the Ardennes. The small band's fierce resistance played a central role in thwarting [...] audacious scheme and ensuring Allied victory in the West.  But the Americans paid a heavy price for their gallantry -- a story that Kershaw captures in vivid, often poignant detail.  \\"The Longest Winter\\" is a terrific World War II tale and an extremely difficult book to put down.	2004-12-06

Going in, all I knew about Jim Rogan was that he lost his Congressional seat because of his role in the Clinton impeachment.  I found out that Rogan's life is a quintessential American success story -- a modern day Horatio Alger.   <br /> <br />This book has nothing to do with the Clinton impeachment, and barely touches at all on Rogan's legislative career.  Instead, its focus is Rogan's hardscrabble youth -- out of wedlock birth to a welfare-dependent Mother, high school dropout, etc -- and his determined, up-from-the-bootstraps ascent to law school graduate, assistant DA, judgeship and an improbable California assembly seat.   <br /> <br />Along the way, Rogan, a lifelong political junkie, converts from Democrat to Republican -- the true \\"party of the little guy\\" -- finds his faith, reconciles with his biological Dad and discovers the blessings of family life. <br />  <br />This book is sprinkled with colorful -- often hilarious -- anecdotes, especially his wayward teenage years, bartender gigs and courtroom experiences. <br /> <br />You don't have to be interested in politics to appreciate Rogan's indefatigable spirit and admire his lifestory. <br />	2004-11-26

Love him or loathe him, it's hard for any reader not to come away from this book with enhanced respect for Thomas. . . for his success in overcoming obstacles in Jim Crow southern Georgia; for his equanimity and courage during the Senate confirmation process; and for the personal warmth and compassion that he masks behind a taciturn, often dour public demeanor.  The author goes to great lengths to show how the values forged by Thomas's grandfather, Myers Anderson -- self-reliance, industriousness, relentless work ethic, pride, individual charity, skepticism toward government -- have helped to inform the Justice's worldview.  The reader does not have to march in lockstep with Thomas's views to admire his Horatio Alger lifestory. <br /> <br />	2004-09-06

The late Chicago journalist Steve Neal (he passed on in February) recounts the '32 Chicago convention that propelled FDR on the path to the White House and immortality.    FDR's nomination was no sure thing, despite his entering the Chicago convention with a strong majority of delegates.  Indeed, Neal shows how close FDR came to being denied the nomination, as past Democratic frontrunners like Champ Clark (1912) and William McAdoo (1924) had before him.  At the time, Democratic candidates needed to amass two-thirds of the delegates to cinch the nomination -- a threshold that assured Southern states a voice in the selection of a candidate, and made for protracted, multi-ballot fights (more than 100 in '24) and brokered conventions.  FDR abolished the two-thirds rule (replacing it with a simple majority standard) and only two subsequent Democratic conventions went past the first ballot.     An eclectic cast of characters loomed large in the machinations that secured FDR's nomination -- for example, Joe Kennedy and WR Hearst, who cleared a path for Cactus Jack Garner to be given the VP slot; Huey Long, whose support was ironic in light of The Kingfish's later vitriolic attacks on FDR, and Big Jim Farley, FDR's brilliant campaign manager.  But no one played a more central role than McAdoo, Woodrow Wilson's son-in-law and Treasury Secretary.  No fan of FDR's, he swung the deeply divided California delegation into the New York Governor's camp at the decisive moment.  This deft maneuver thwarted the ambitions of FDR's bete noir, Al Smith (who had foiled McAdoo hopes in '24) and McAdoo's old nemesis Newton Baker, who was the likely beneficiary of a deadlocked convention. (At one point, FDR offered to throw his support to Baker.)     This book takes its title from the FDR campaign's theme song.  But I was surprised to learnthat \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\" was actually a substitute when the original theme song --\\"Anchor's Away\\" (paying homage to FDR's stint as assistant Navy Secretary) -- was deemed too subdued for the raucous Chicago partisans.     Political junkies looking for a short reprieve from the '04 presidential sweepstakes would do well to pick up Neal's new book.  It'll transport you back to a time when political conventions still mattered.	2004-08-29

It should also say he's an extraordinary storyteller.   <br /> <br />This book is just terrific: brisk narrative pace, interesting characters, colorful anecdotes.  It deals simultaneously with the Civil War's initial clash of arms in the mountains of western Virginia, and the political machinations that surrounded the birth of West Virginia and its entry into the Union as the 35th state.  <br /> <br />Western Virginia is the place where Generals McClellan and Lee  make their Civil War debuts. It is from these mountains that McClellen emerges as the Young Napoleon, hailed as the Union's savior. McClellen's prodigious organizational skills are clearly evident; for example, he pioneers the use of the telegraph in battlefield communications -- one of a dozen Civil War \\"firsts\\" the author cites.  But the tendencies that would later cost McClellen his command and sully his reputation in military history already begin to rear their heads: exaggeration of enemy troop strength; battlefield timidity (\\"he sat there with indecision stamped on every line of his countenance\\"); a haughty, supercilious  manner.      <br /> <br />In contrast to McClellan, Lee limps out of western Virginia with his reputation greatly diminished -- undermined by uncooperative mountain weather, poor timing and internecine fueds between  political generals that precluded battlefield coordination.  It was during the bleak days in western Virginia that Lee grew a white beard, and earned the derisive sobriquet, \\"Granny Lee.\\"  <br /> <br />The western Virginia campaign often receives short shrift in Civil War histories, overshadowed by the larger, bloodier engagements that followed. \\"Rebels at the Gate\\" fills the void and does so with an engaging, well-paced narrative.  This book is sure to delight anyone interested in the American Civil War.	2004-08-28

If that's the case, then General Tommy Franks has provided us with an excellent second draft. <br /> <br />The 560-plus-page memoir spans the General's entire life, but it is his candid (I dare not say \\"frank\\") account of the Afghan and Iraq wars that prove so absorbing and hold the reader in thrall.   <br /> <br />I try to stay reasonably well informed on current events, but must admit I learned a great deal.  For example, I always wondered why the 4th ID remained out in the Mediterranean when the Iraq invasion got underway.  Franks reveals it was part of an elaborate deception strategy that persuaded Saddam and his generals that a last-minute deal had been cut to allow the 4th ID to attack through Turkey. Even after the 3rd ID and 1st MEF launched their lightning march toward Baghdad, Republican Guard units were still poised to repulse a second invasion from the north, which never came.   <br /> <br />It was also quite a revelation to learn that both King Abdullah of Jordan and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt warned General Franks about Saddam's illicit WMD during the build-up to the war. And depsite Yemini President Saleh's obstensible \\"friendship\\" in the aftermath of the USS Cole bombing, Franks distrusted him and used Saleh as a conduit to feed disinformation to Saddam. <br /> <br />The General clearly has disdain for Richard Clarke, characterizing him as a \\"performer\\" who never gave Franks \\"a single operational recommendation or single page of actionable intelligence.\\"  <br /> <br />Franks was skeptical about the influence of Ahmad Chalabi, viewing him and other affluent exiles as \\"Gucci\\" leaders with little popular support.  <br /> <br />Doug Feith (Pentagon #3) is depicted as clueless and viewed by  the General's staff as the \\"dumbest bleeping man on the planet.\\" <br /> <br />The General complains of friction between the Pentagon and State Department staffs, and holds Powell and Rumsfeld responsible for not reining in their subordinates.  Franks has few other negative words to say about Rumsfeld (perhaps becuase they became personal friends), though he clearly chafed under the DefSec's impatience -- \\"I am still not seeing any movement, General\\" -- during the early days of the Afghan invasion.  Contrary to some press accounts, never once is there a hint, suggestion, order, etc from Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Richard Myers or anyone else that troop requests be scaled back.   <br /> <br />Powell does mildly question whether enough troops have been deployed for the invasion.  Franks respects and admires Powell, but says he failed to grasp the sea-changes in strategic doctrine in the decade since his retirement. <br /> <br />Throughout, President Bush is portrayed as poised, engaged, inquisitive and firmly in charge.  A model Commander-in-Chief, in Franks' eyes. <br /> <br />I was a little disappointed that the General did not shed more light on Operation Anaconda.  Did Osama, Mullah Omar, Zawahiri, et al \\"slip the noose\\" in the mountains of Tora Bora?  Did we rely too heavily on local warlords who betrayed our trust?  Did elements of the Pakistan ISS or armed forces aid their flight?  Franks is silent on these matters. <br /> <br />Aside from that, \\"American Soldier\\" provides an informative window on unfolding history from a principal who helped to shape it.  Highly recommended.	2004-08-21

One of these, \\"Down 42nd Street,\\" was a huge disappointment, littered with factual inaccuracies and nearly incoherent in its recounting of the epic 1990s re-development saga. (See my March 30, 2002 review of this book for specifics.) <br /> <br />Anthony Bianco's \\"Ghosts of 42nd Street\\" suffers from no such shortcomings.   Indeed, one of this book's central strengths is its detailed \\"insider's\\" account of the street's 1990s metamorphosis.   Rebecca Robertson is depicted as a genuine heroine, envisioning earlier than most - certainly before anyone in the government bureaucracy - that the rehabilitation of the turn-of-the-century theaters would be the linchpin in restoring 42nd Street's luster.  Robertson was prescient in foreseeing that office development would follow the theaters' revival.    <br /> <br />42nd Street has always been filled with characters and we meet many of them.  For example, there's Marty Hodas, a struggling 1960s entrepreneur who emerges as \\"The King of Peeps,\\" before running afoul of federal tax laws.  Then there's Seymour Durst, the obstreperous developer who waged a clever campaign to block re-development, but whose family would build the first new office tower.    <br /> <br />There's a lot of interesting New York City history here as well.  We learn, for example, that the financier August Belmont was the catalyst behind changing the name Long Acre Square to Times Square.  The New York Times publisher Adolph Ochs ostensibly had nothing to do with it, though it was Ochs himself who conceived the New Year's Eve ball dropping festivities in 1906.  There's also a vivid account of the demise of legendary architect, bon vivant and habitual lady's-man Sanford White at the hands of a jealous husband.     <br /> <br />If you read only one book about 42nd Street, this is certainly the one. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-06

The survey is a fair and balanced (to borrow a phrase) appraisal of U.S. presidents, representing the opinions of 78 scholars, including 30 historians, 25 political scientists and 23 law professors.  The survey sponsors were scrupulous about achieving ideological balance to avoid the &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; orientation that has marked previous surveys.<br />It is interesting to see how viewpoints varied among the three groups of respondents.  For example, while Washington ranked #1 overall, Lincoln edged him for top honors among both historians and political scientists.  Meanwhile, Wilson (#11 overall) attained top 10 status among political scientists and historians, but managed to rank just 15th among law professors. Not surprising, modern presidents were the most controversial: Reagan (#8 overall) ranked as high as fifth among legal scholars but did not reach the top 10 among historians.  Clinton (#24 overall) ranked as high as 20th among historians, but only 27th among political scientists and 28th among law professors.<br />Besides the survey results, the book contains informative profiles of all 43 U.S. presidents.  The write-ups are generally sympathetic, but not overly obsequious.  I found the profiles of Grant and Hoover more positive than expected.  Curiously, the Truman profile fails to mention the Korean War, even when making reference to several elements of Truman's Cold War containment strategy.<br />All in all, &quot;Presidential Leadership&quot; is a worthy addition to any home library, certainly a valuable reference tool for anyone with school-age children and grandchildren.	2004-07-12

With 23-year hindsight, it's almost comical to recall the paroxysm of worldwide indignation that the Israeli military action provoked at the time.  Even unabashed hawks like Maggie \\"Iron Lady\\" Thatcher, Alexander Haig and Jeanne Kirkpatrick excoriated Israel for \\"unprovoked\\" and \\"reckless\\" aggression. Only Ronald Reagan seemed nonplussed by the action: \\"What a fine piece of bombing.\\"<br />What sane person would have preferred for Saddam to have been nuclear armed when he his tanks rolled into Kuwait less than 10 years later? <br />\\"Raid on the Sun\\" is filled with revealing, behind-the-scenes vignettes of pilot derring-do, cloak-and-dagger intrigue and Mossad ruthlessness.

But as Dominic Sandbrook demonstrates, McCarthy's legacy is much more nuanced and tortured than popularly imagined. <br />If you fondly recall McCarthy's '68 campaign (this reader is too young to have any recollection of it whatsoever), Sandbrook's book is sure to give you pause. It portrays a reactionary eccentric often lost in the \\"Golden Age\\" of the Thirteenth Century; a lazy, often disengaged lawmaker with little to show for a 22-year legislative career; a spiteful, mean-spirited loner given to caustic mocking of friends and rivals alike; an untrustworthy person of questionable ethics despite strong Catholic convictions (a daily churchgoer who twice enrolled in the Benedictine order); a venal, self-absorbed politican who time and again puts himself ahead of loyalty to patrons and Party. <br />This reader was struck by how thoroughly the Politics of Personality animates this book:<br />* McCarthy supported first Humphrey then Stevenson in '60 because he believed that he -- not JFK -- deserved to be the first Irish Catholic President.  (\\"I'm twice as liberal as Humphrey and twice as Catholic as Kennedy.\\")<BR>* McCarthy's personal animus for LBJ (his one-time patron) had its origins not in Vietnam policy, but McCarthy's treatment during the '64 VP selection process. (\\"What a sadistic son of a bitch.\\")<BR>* McCarthy's stated reason for launching his '68 campaign was to either compel LBJ to change his Vietnam policy or prod RFK to enter the race.  When RFK finally did announce for President, McCarthy reneged on this commitment. (McCarthy's nonplussed reaction to news of RFK's murder: \\"He brought it on himself, demagoguing to the last.\\")<BR>* When Humphrey (a McCarthy patron dating back to '48) finally wrested the Democratic nomination, a brooding McCarthy refused to lift a finger in support, finally offering a desultory endorsement a week before the election. More vigorous support from McCarthy certainly could have been enough for Humphrey to close a 500,000 popular vote deficit. (Humphrey: \\"The only tender a politican has is his word and Gene's currency is devalued ... A strange man.\\")<br />This book is filled with revelatory (for this reader) anecdotes.  For example: Humphrey probably financially supported McCarthy's insurgency to brake RFK in the primaries. (Humphrey did not compete in the primaries.)<br />In terms of engrossing storylines and powerful personalities, the Sixties represented the high war mark of Presidential politics.  This new McCarthy biography is a terrific read for anyone looking to broaden their knowledge of that epoch, although readers will be hard pressed to come away with an enhanced opinion of McCarthy himself.	2004-05-16

The book might have been more aptly named &quot;An American Way of War.&quot;  With the Battle of Trenton and the winter campaign of 1776-77, David Hackett Fischer posits that Washington established an enduring precedent for American war-fighting that survives today.  This style, for example, places an exceptionally high premium on bold, decisive action and lightning (by 18th Century standards) movement; also, the preservation of individual life is an absolute imperative.  (Manpower preservation being both a moral judgment and a practical battlefield necessity for the Americans.)<br />The stark differences in British and American approaches are graphically illuminated in the respective councils of war on the evening of January 2, 1777.  In the Britsh council, Lord Cornwallis dictated the course of action (&quot;more a ruler than a leader,&quot; in the author's words), reflecting the heirarchical nature of his society.  The input of subordinates was not solicited, and Cornwallis rejected summarily suggestions (prescient in hindsight) to launch an immediate night attack.  In contrast, Washington's war council was more open and pluralistic, with alternate viewpoints -- even those of civilians -- actively encouraged and considered.  From this diversity of opinion a brilliant plan was conceived to slip around the entrenched British forces under the cover of darkness, and boldly attack their rear at Princeton.  The American plan, Hackett Fischer observes, was born of an open, less stratified society, with expanding notions of liberty and freedom -- ideals that George Washington embraced. <br />This book is very well written, with a crisp narrative pace and excellent character development.  The author provides sufficient (though not overwhelming) historical context so that readers without much Revolutionary War background -- me included -- will find it most enjoyable.	2004-05-10

All the great, larger-than-life personalities are vividly portrayed -- Santa Anna, Austin, Crockett, Bowie, etc. However, Sam Houston clearly emerges as the most sympathetic character. Brands shows how little control Houston wielded over an ill-discipined, poorly-trained, largely volunteer fighting force.  Out-manned and out-gunned, Houston's strategy combined a steady retreat toward the U.S. border with appeals to his mentor, Pres. Andrew Jackson, to intercede.  It was the restiveness (and insubordination) of his troops that finally compelled Houston to turn and face Santa Anna, leading to the breathtaking rout of the Mexican regulars at San Jacinto, and the capture of the self-proclaimed &quot;Napoleon of the West.&quot; <br />Brands has written many stellar histories, including biographies of Ben Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt as well as an opus on the California Gold Rush.  &quot;Lone Star Nation&quot; is another five-star installment in that pantheon.

Simon's life had so many incarnations -- prescient Wall Street trader, principled public servant (energy czar and treasury secretary), conservative intellectual, pathbreaking merchant banker, champion of the U.S. Olympic movement, philanthropist, intrepid adventurer, Eucharistic Minister -- that it's hard to fathom one person leading such an eclectic, richly diverse life.<br />Known for his sharp opinions while in public office, Simon is largely magnanimous in recounting his life experiences.  For example, he declines to elaborate on the reasons for his falling out with a longtime colleague and business partner, saying only that he trusted someone he thought was his friend.  He pulls no puches, however, in expressing outrage at wrongheaded government decisions, such as the 1989 FIRREA Act (which suddenly made struggling S&Ls insolvent), Pres. Carter's Olympic boycott (which accomplished little other than prompting Soviet retaliation four years later) and foolish government meddling in the oil market (rationing, price controls, etc. which largely created the 1970s energy \\"crisis\\").<br />The memoir offers several colorful, revealing anecdotes.  For example, Simon's pointed counsel to Ronald Reagan, urging him to drop former Pres Ford from consideration for the Vice Presidency. (I never heard or read of this before; Lou Cannon makes no mention of it in his new biography of Reagan's pre-presidential years.)  Also, Simon's confrontation -- nearly leading to blows -- with an inebriated Vice President Rockefeller. This is fascinating stuff.  <br />Equally fascinating are the chapters on Simon's pioneering role in the use of Leverage Buyouts to restore underperforming companies to sound profitability. Simon eschewed hostile LBOs, preferring to work cooperatively with, and empowering, management, and deftly abandondedthe business when it attracted a surfeit of \\"takeover artist\\" capital in the late 1980s.<br />Simon's separation from, and reconcilliation with, his wife of 40 years is particularly poignant, as is his ministry to indigent AIDs patients and other destitute people.  The caring and compassion behind a gruff -- sometimes mercurial exterior -- is palpable.<br />William Simon led an amazing, noble life.  Emulating such an extraordinary human being is beyond the reach of most of us.  But thanks to this new book, we can at least read about and admire him.  Highly recommended.	2004-02-29

But as Max Boot demonstrated in his &quot;The Savage Wars of Peace&quot; (2002), scores of military engagements, interventions, peacekeeping operations and so-called &quot;small&quot; wars have had consequential impact.  Boot discusses many such pre-Vietnam operations, including the efforts to end Barbary Coast piracy, the Spanish-American war, the Pancho Villa expedition, and various South America and the Caribbean interventions, among others. <br />Now Peter Huchthausen picks up where Boot left off, with a concise examination of more than a dozen military operations that occurred between 1975 and 2000.    <br />Huchthausen, best known as the author of &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker,&quot; presents the ignominious (Iranian Hostage Rescue, Lebanon, Somalia) alongside the unqualified successes (Panama, Desert Shield/Storm, Libya retaliation) and engagements in which success came at a price (Grenada, Kosovo).  <br />Throughout the narrative, it is interesting to observe the U.S. military progressively restoring its efficacy following its &quot;hollow&quot; period in the immediate aftermath of Vietnan.  And we see the positive effects of the Goldwater-Nichols reforms (1986) in fostering increased inter-service cooperation and improved operational performance.  Inter-service coordination, for example, was much better in Panama (late 1989) than in Grenada (1983).<br />Huchthausen's book is a highly readable, compact overview, easily digestible in one session or two.  Well worth the time for anyone interested in the creation of the modern U.S. military, whose recent successes in Afghanistan and Iraq we've all marveled at.	2004-02-22

Only one reivew since October. Too bad. British journalist James Holland, in his maiden book, engagingly tells the story of the indefatigable Maltese people and their stalwart RAF and Royal Navy defenders.  The island's stubborn, against-the-odds resistance allowed Malta to remain a strategic Allied stronghold throughout the Mediterranian campaign: first, enabling the interdiction of Axis supplies and reinforcements headed for North Africa and then serving as a bridgehead for the Allied invasion of Siciliy.  Hitler's failure to invade the weakened island redoubt has to go down as one of his bigger blunders.<br />Holland's narrative is sprinkled with vivid, first-person recollections and meticulously reconstructed feats of derring-do. The relentless German air assualt's impact on ordinary civilians is particularly poignant, as are the the accounts of intrepid RAF pilots dueling numerically superior Axis fighters.  The exploits of one reconnaissance pilot, Adrian Warburton, is the stuff of Hollywood.  <br />It was also fascinating to learn that the entire island was awarded the George Cross -- Britain's high civilian award for gallantry --for withstanding the vicious, three-year siege.  The London Blitz pales in comparison.  <br />Here's hoping more readers discover \\"Fortress Malta.\\" Looking forward to Holland's next book.	2004-02-01

Roosevelt, Grover Cleveland, Fiorello LaGuardia, Diamond Jim Brady and legions of others) lhas produced a fun, engaging table-top book that is sure to inspire spirited conversation at holiday family gatherings.  <br />Jeffers provides two- to two-and-a-half-page vignettes of 100 men and women whose heroic achievements influenced world events.  His purpose is to offer readers succinct biographical sketches. He makes no pretense as to authoritativeness, saying the list reflects personal preference, and provides no rationale or justification for his rankings. Readers would surely be curious to know why, for example, Fiorella LaGuardia (#42) ranks twice as high as Rudy Giuliani (#86); General Patton rates a middling #83, or Oliver North (#94) merits inclusion at all.<br />Military and political heroes dominate the Jeffers list.  The top five are all heads of state -- Washington, Lincoln, FDR, Churchill and Reagan -- and clearly, World War II and Cold War hold transcendent importance.  At least 18 figures have World War II connections.  By comparison, the U.S. Civil War claims only six entrants -- Lincoln, Grant (#13), Clara Barton (#38), Harriet Tubman (#45), Farragaut (#56) and Gouverner Kemble Warren (#92).<br />Arguments can always be made for overlooked individuals -- Rosa Parks or Thurgood Marshall, for example, or General Lucious Clay, organizer of the 1948 Berlin Airlift.  It is interesing that Jeffers includes Willy Brandt (#90), Berlin Mayor during the 1961 crisis, but leaves off Konrad Adenauer, the Republic of Germany's first Chancellor, who firmly planted his pivotal country in the Western orbit during a vulnerable time when it could have as easily fallen under Soviet dominion.<br />And it's difficult to fathom how Civil War hero Joshua Chamberlain could be ignored.  In fact, the entire 19th Century is given relatively short shrift.  How about Nat Turner (leader of a notable slave insurrection) or John Brown?Or General Winfield Scott, who served with distinction from the War of 1812 to the Civil War's dawn? Or Zachary Taylor, who swept to the White House on the strength of his Mexican War exploits?<br />The Jeffers list is refreshingly free of subversives, terrorists, Communists (ok, Gorbachev is #18 but at least he presided over Communism's dissolution) and despots of all stripes (except Napoleon, #10).  There is no Che Geuvera, Castro, Arafat, Paul Robeson, Rosenbergs, Lenin, Mao or anyone connected with the late Sixties counter-culture.  <br />Among a legion of virtuous stories, Capitain Eddie Rickenbacker's (#70) stands as clearly the most compelling. <br />This book is not without its frustrations.  For one, the author's penchant to rate related people consecutively:  for example, Thomas Jefferson (#50) and Merriwether Lewis (#51); John Glenn (#22) and Neil Armstrong (#23); and a sports cluster from #73-77: Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Joe Louis, Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson.  And where is Jesse Owens?<br />More exasperating is sloppy editing and a raft of factual errors and inconsistencies: Reagan was born alternately in 1911 and 1917; Washington died in 1799 but later was succeeded by John Adams in 1801; Bill Clinton defeated George HW Bush in 1982 (neither makes the list); Sergeant Alvin York (#31) was variously born in Tennessee and Kentucky; Lord Mountbatten (#66) was killed in either 1976 or 1979.<br />Despite these deficiencies, \\"The 100 Greatest Heroes\\" is an excellent read and terrific conversation piece.	2003-12-14

This is a superb book, destined to the the definitive standard on its subject, that will appeal strongly to readers with a wide variety of tastes and interests. <br />Seven decades removed from the event -- with Rock Center holding such an iconic place in the Manhattan skyline -- this reader was especially struck by Rock Center's seemingly star-crossed beginnings: its architecture universally excoriated (Lewis Mumford being among the most vociferous early critics, until suddenly and inexplicably reversing course); opening night at Radio City Music Hall an unmitigated flop; the sparsely-trafficked retail concourse derided as &quot;the catacombs;&quot; a controversial Diego Rivera mural providing a public relations black-eye, etc.  With its leasing program stalled in the Depression-ravaged economy, the Rockefellers desperately slashed office rents from $4 to $1 per sq ft, under-cutting the market. Their tactic of buying-out the existing leases of companies being courted to lease space at the Center -- not uncommon in today's marketplace -- drew the opprobrium of rival property owners, including a lawsuit from August Heckscher (whose grandson would go on to be a high profile Parks Commissioner). <br />&quot;Great Fortune&quot; is laden with rich anecdotes and compelling, larger-than-life characters like the mercurial John R. Todd (managing agent and construction manager and grandfather to the future New Jersey Governor, Christine Todd-Whitman); the lead architect with a penchant for fast living, Raymond Hood, and, of course, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his ambitious second son, Nelson, first among equals of the Rockefeller's third generation.<br />Okrent is a gifted wordsmith (it's not suprising that the New York Times just named him its new ombudsman) who's penned an entertaining, fast-paced narrative. Anyone even remotely curious about New York City and its history will be held in thrall from cover to cover. Recommended.	2003-11-17
US	51701483	RRIESOOYZ6VHY	0743217802	276350978	They Marched Into Sunlight: War and Peace Vietnam and America October 1967	Books	5	60	61	N	N	Book of the Year	\\"They Marched into Sunlight\\" is without doubt the best book I've read this year, and should be a top contender for the '03 Pulitzer in History. Maraniss is an exceptionally skilled storyteller, a talent he displayed in abundance in his excellent Vince Lombardi biography, \\"When Pride Still Mattered.\\"  In \\"Sunlight,\\" he chronicles two events that occurred half a world apart on October 17, 1967: the ambush of two under-manned companies of the U.S. First Infantry Division (\\"Big Red One\\") in Vietnam, and the violent clash between police and student demonstrators who were attempting to block Dow Chemical Co. (the maker of naplam) from recruiting on the Univ of Wisconsin campus.  Maraniss adroitly weaves a coherent, engaging narrative from these disparate events (no easy task), producing a thoroughly entrancing work.  There are many heart-rending stories depicted --- for example, Col. Terry Allen, son of the legendary Big Red One general in WWII, and Major David Holleder, a former West Point All-American, both of whom are slain in the battle. The painful dissolution of his marriage -- and the selfish perfidy and betrayal by his wife -- add special poignance to Allen's story.<BR> <BR>We also learn of ironic coincidences (\\"connections,\\" Maraniss calls them). For example, the improbable marriage between the son of an anti-Dow protestor and the daughter of a Vietnam ambush survivor.  Or the significance of \\"knocks on wood.\\"  On the one hand, the popular Eddie Floyd song, hummed continually for good luck by a sergeant; on the other, the secret signal employed by the VC to trigger the deadly ambush.<br />Particularly with the Wisconsin story, Maraniss presents a  multitude of voices and perspectives -- administrators, law enforcement officials, protest organizers (including the self-proclaimed \\"resident demagouge\\"), bystanders and apolitical students who became radicalized by horror they witness.  However, in a very large cast of characters -- I found myself continually consulting the alphabetical listing at the front of the book to keep everyone straight: \\"Okay, that's the girl from New Jersey, who missed her French exam . . .\\" -- the one voice we don't hear is students' who were denied the opportunity to interview with Dow. What did they think of the takeover of the Commerce Building?  Or the decision to deploy the police to clear it?  What about the trammeling of THEIR rights?  What happened to them later? What careers did they pursue?  The viewpoint of one or two of these students would have added to the narrative.<br />Even in spite of that one shortcoming, \\"Sunlight\\" is a easily a five-star work, a compelling story -- actually two stories -- superbly told in the hands of Maraniss.<br />In closing, I want to observe that it is amazing how many people with cameo roles in the Wisconsin story would go on to greater noteriety -- Melvin Laird, Lynn and Dick Cheney, Tommy Thompson, David Keene, James Sensenbrenner, to name just a few.	2003-10-25

But the Buddy Cianci story is highly entertaining, often comical.  I was not surprised at all to learn that the book had been optioned for a movie even prior to publication.  Unlike other reviewers, I was not familiar at all with Buddy Cianci or Providence or its reputation for mob infestation and deep-seated corruption.  \\"The Prince\\" held me in thrall for all 400 pages as revelation upon revelation of kickbacks, bribery, intimidation and general malfeasance unfolded.<br />I would recommend this book highly to the most general audience.  However, one caveat: it's mostly a book about crime and punishment, not politics.  Personally, I would have liked to have learned more about Cianci's failed 1980 gubernatorial campaign. On one page, it appears that Buddy will win by acclamation; on the next, with little explanation, he's a landslide loser, failing to carry one city or even a single hometown ward.  Having said that, \\"The Prince\\" is still first rate for its pure entertainment value. Definitely five stars.	2003-09-13

The story has an intriguing premise about septuagenarian World War Two vets returning to Belgium to re-live their Battle of the Bulge experiences.  The plot is original and storyline bold and fast-paced, but the vivid characters are best of all. These are our aged parents and grandparents facing down old demons and re-affirming life at a time when many of them were playing out the string.  I want to emphasize that this book is NOT just for military or history buffs.  Readers with a variety of tastes will find &quot;Reunion&quot; extremely difficult to put down.  Recommended.	2003-07-12

But I saw an excerpt dealing with the Model-T in \\"American Heritage\\" magazine and was immediately hooked.<br />Douglas Brinkley parlays his well-honed historical research skills with an obvious passion for cars and a gift for storytelling in this excellent account of the first century of the Ford Motor Company.  The history -- written with the encouragement and cooperation of Ford and particularly its CEO, Bill Ford, Jr -- is a \\"warts and all\\" presentation of Ford Motor's out-szed impact on the 20th Century.<br />The first two-thirds of the book, devoted to the life of Henry Ford, is by far the most interesting.  We see a master promoter who had a penchant for co-opting the best ideas of others and for purging the best minds around him.  He was also filled with abundant contradications -- the best friend of the \\"working man\\" (he summarily doubled wages with the stroke of a pen) who later stood by as his organization violently repressed the budding union movement; the vile anti-semitic (Hitler adopted some of his pronouncements) who was also ahead of his time in minority hiring; a committed (often irrational) pacificist who nevertheless took advantage of military contracts during both world wars; the pioneer who did as much as anyone to advance the industrial age as well as the spread of suburban sprawl, all the while clinging to the quixotic belief that America's redemption lie in a return to the rustic origins of his youth.  The list could go on.<br />The book loses some of its narrative energy in the final chapter (ironically titled, \\"Momentum\\"), which is mostly a desultory account of the Ford Explorer tire recall imbroglio as well as a catalog of recent Ford marketing and advertising initiatives.  Also, it is obvious that Brinkley finds Bill Ford, Jr. a kindred spirit, but his portrayal of the current Ford CEO is a little too fawning for my taste.  For these reasons, I downgraded the book to a four-star rating.  <br />Nevertheless, readers looking for a better understanding of America in the 20th Century will find this book most enjoyable.	2003-07-06

And few do it better than the Gingrich-Forstchen collaboration in this well researched, alternative account of the Battle of Gettysburg.<br />In a nutshell, Lee heeds Longstreet's advice -- and does it one better. Rather than engage in a direct frontal assault, he opts for speed and maneuver, the traits that served him and Jackson so well at Chancellorsville and Second Manassas. The Army of Northern Virginia captures the Union supplies at Westminster, MD, and takes the high ground between Gettysburg and Washington, DC, inviting Meade to attack. The ensuing collision is the real Gettysburg in reverse: Longstreet entrenched on the high ground and Meade compelled into reckless, suicidal charges across open fields.<br />Some of the principal actors are portrayed true to form, while others take on new, enhanced qualities. For example, Longstreet is somehow imbued with Jackson's daring and audacity, and is rewarded with the defensive engagement he has always coveted. Conversely, Ewell retains his true-to-life, post-Manassas timidity. Throughout, Meade is cautious almost to the point of paralysis, and with a few notable exceptions (Hunt, Sickles, Hancock), the entire Union High Command is uniformly incompetent.<br />\\"Gettysburg\\" is a page-turning work of historical fiction that will be enjoyed by many readers, even those with limited Civil War knowledge. However, one caveat is in order: the battle scenes are vividly rendered and the descriptions of carnage, destruction and the detritus of war are quite vivid. Not to be read on a full stomach.	2003-06-08

Durant's new memoir provides many insightful details of his nearly two-week captivity (and its aftermath) not found in Mark Bowden's classic account of the Battle of Mogadishu. The book is an emotional roller-coaster. We are inspired by the heroic selflessness of Gordon and Shughart (the Delta Force operators), and Durant's own courage and stoicism throughout his painful confinement. Most often, he is preoccupied with concern for the well-being of his wife and infant son, as well as tortured anxiety over the fate of his colleagues at the crash site. Rarely is there hint of self-pity or rancor toward his captors. Indeed, he forges an interesting bond with his chief minder, finding ways to communicate despite language and cultural barriers. Especially uplifting is Durant's account of his Red Cross visitor, an event followed immediately by his negative experiences with a pair of international journalists, one French (it figures!), the other Canadian. A definite downer. The story's emotional nadir, however, is the chilling account of Durant's ordeal at the hands of the unruly Somali mob, including a vile, nauseating revelation about how his cheekbone was fractured.<br />\\"In the Company of Heroes\\" was a difficult book to put down. It should not be missed, even if you've read \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"	2003-05-31

Bedford, VA lost 19 sons within minutes of their landing at Omaha Beach.  Three more died later in the campaign.  Among those to perish were two pairs of brothers.  Five Bedford Boys --including one whose twin brother was among those cut down on the beach -- were spared when their landing craft sank on the approach to Normandy, and they narrowly survived the chilly, roiling Atlantic swells.<br />Bedford is very much a microcosim of America -- a sleepy town of 3,000 -- whose sons and their loved ones paid an inordinate price for freedom.  The Bedford Boys never intended to be heroes -- or warriors, for that matter. (Most joined the National Guard in the 1930's for the few extra dollars to supplement Depression-era wages.)  But heroes they became, and Alex Kershaw has paid them fine tribute with this vivid, heart-rending account of their experiences.<br />&quot;The Bedford Boys&quot; is a particularly timely read now, with young Americans once again being asked to bear the ultimate sacrifice.	2003-05-05

Last summer's \\"Master of the Senate\\" was an instant classic, and prompted me to investigate Caro's earlier LBJ works.  I was not disappointed.<br />\\"Means of Ascent\\" is Caro's superb account of Johnson's all-or-nothing gambit to graduate from the House to the Senate. Caro blends exemplary literary talent with adroit investigative reporting skills. The result is a brilliant, gripping narrative that is a compelling page-turner for anyone with even the most remote interest in government. <br />In LBJ, Caro brings to life a complex, flawed and multi-dimensional character. Few American personalities evoke the same passionate combination of antipathy and reverence (with these diameterically opposed feelings often held simultaneously).<br />The years covered in this book (1941-1948) are some of the most uneventful of LBJ's career. There is no Great Society, no civil rights initiative, no legislative mastery, no foreign policy imbroglio. Instead, LBJ whiled away his time as a do-nothing Congressman, his influence eroded by the demise of the New Deal (to which he hitched his early House years) and all but gone with the passing of FDR. Despite his bravado, LBJ sat out WWII, except for one harrowing, near-death experience as an observer on an Air Force combat mission (which in the re-telling, Johnson would amplify into Silver-Star-worthy accomplishment).<br />The fulcrum of the story -- and indeed, LBJ's entire political career -- is the history-turning 1948 Senate contest against former Gov. Coke Stevenson, one of the most beloved politicians in Texas history. Caro graphically and painstakingly depicts how Johnson set about to both destroy Stevenson's reputation and flagrantly steal an election through cash-payments, voter fraud and post-election legal chicanery (succeeding in the latter but not the former).<br />Caro does a masterful job of portraying the two combatants -- the stoic, taciturn Stevenson (\\"Mr. Texas\\")and the garrulous, flamboyant, and often contemptible LBJ.  <br />I have long felt that journalists make the best historical writers.  \\"Means of Ascent\\" is another confirmation of that.	2003-03-16

Reston and the Rise and Fall of American Journalism	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Engaging Account of How Political Reporting Changed	This is an engaging biography about the foremost political journalist of his era. More than that, \\"Scotty\\" is a revealing chronicle of the transformation of journalism. Scotty Reston embodied the old school, \\"establishment\\" journalism of the pre-Vietnam/Watergate variety. His success was founded on incomparable access, born of a mutually trusting relationship with Washington movers and shakers. When Pres. Kennedy emerged from a verbal going-over from Krushchev at the Vienna summit, the first person he spoke with -- and bared his soul to -- was Scotty Reston, who, Kennedy knew, would be extremely judicious in reporting what he learned. Journalists like Reston were natural skeptics, but believed in the essential truth of what government officials told them. White House entreaties persuaded Reston and his colleagues to hold a news-story exposing the planned Bay of Pigs invasion a few days before it was launched. It's hard to imagine journalists today making the same decision.<br />Vietnam and Watergate opened up a wide chasm between journalists and Washington insiders. Natural skepticism hardened into cynicism and the investigative journalism ethos was born. Reston -- despite his many well-earned laurels and impeccable reputation -- failed to keep up. Vacationing at the time on Martha's Vineyard, Reston was the first New York Times reporter to file a report on the Ted Kennedy Chappaquiddick fiasco. His lead: \\"Tragedy has again struck the Kennedy family.\\" Mary Jo Kopechne was not mentioned until the fourth paragraph. Reston saw the event through the prism of its impact on the powerful, and ultimately dismissed the episode as a one-day story. It took another younger, more aggressive Times reporter to uncover the truth of the tragedy, and Kennedy's reprehensible conduct that night. Similarly, his too-cozy relationship with Henry Kissinger blinded Reston to the truth about Kissinger's role in the 1972 Christmas bombing of North Vietnam. <br />I do not mean to be negative about Reston. He was clearly the most accomplished journalist of his (or perhaps any) era, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner whose superb reporting routinely broke major news-stories. As broadcast media multiplied, Reston also pioneered a new role for print journalism: explaining why events occurred, not merely reporting what happened. But so much of this book is focused on what the subtitle calls \\"the rise and fall of American journalism.\\"<br />Readers will also be fascinated by the internecine warfare between New York and the Washington bureau, and especially, the titanic power struggles between Reston and Abe Rosenthal, which resulted in Reston's abbreviated, 13-month reign as Executive Editor. Also notable is the long line of legendary names that Reston mentored -- Halberstam, Wicker, Anthony Lewis, Max Frankel, etc. <br />\\"Scotty\\" is a worthwhile read for anyone with an interest in the intersection of journalism and politics.	2003-01-12

I heartily agree.<br />Rarely has a 530-page tome held me in thrall the way this book did.  Rick Atkinson presents a brilliant account of the U.S. Army's baptism by fire on the shores, plains and mountains of North Africa in 1942-43 -- the campaign in which the commanders learned to command (or were relieved), the officers learned to lead, and the troops developed an impassioned enmity for the Axis enemy.<br />In many years of reading, I have found that journalists (like Cornelius Ryan) often  make the best historical writers.  Rick Atkinson -- a former Washington Post reporter/editor whose story-telling prowess was abundantly demonstrated in &quot;The Long Gray Line&quot; -- follows in that tradition.  <br />Please do not be intimidated by the book's girth; even the World War II novice will find &quot;An Army At Dawn&quot; to be a fast-paced, engaging, often spellbinding narratve.	2002-12-01

Brands' glittering new work is worth its weight in gold.  In &quot;The Age of Gold,&quot; Brands, an acclaimed biographer of Benjamin Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt, trains his considerable narrative talents on the California Gold Rush.  We learn of the worldwide flight to California unleashed by gold's 1848 discovery, and the role of central figures, such as John Fremont, Leland Stanford, and many lesser known characters, in shaping the Golden State in its early years.  <br />I found Brands' central thesis particularly interesting.  The Gold Rush, he says, can be seen as a demarcation line in the forging of a new American Dream. Prior to the gold strike at Coloma, most Americans held to a Puritan belief in the value of thirft, hard work and gradual wealth accumulation.  A deep-seated aversion to failure made risk-taking something to be strenuously avoided.  After Coloma, failure began to lose its stigma.  Americans became more comfortable with the concept of risk.  A failed gold strike -- or the failure of any business venture -- became a learning experience, an accepted setback in the inexorable quest for ultimate success.  The Gold Rush can be seen as the Mother of the American entrepreneurial spirit, and Brands says its no coincidence that the same northern California region that yielded gold in abundance 150 years ago is home to today's Silicon Valley.<br />An excellent read.  Highly recommended.	2002-11-02

The Gold Rush, he says, can be seen as a demarcation line in the forging of a new American Dream. Prior to the gold strike at Coloma, most Americans held to a Puritan belief in the value of thrift, hard work and gradual wealth accumulation. A deep-seated aversion to failure made risk-taking something to be strenuously avoided. After Coloma, failure began to lose its stigma. Americans became more comfortable with the concept of risk. A failed gold strike -- or the demise of any business venture -- became a learning experience, an accepted setback in the inexorable quest for ultimate success. The Gold Rush can be seen as the Mother of the American entrepreneurial spirit, and Brands says its no coincidence that the same northern California region that yielded gold in abundance 150 years ago is home to today's Silicon Valley.<br />An excellent read. Highly recommended.	2002-11-02

In the process, he provides an engaging -- albeit uni-dimensional -- history of New York politics over the past 40 years.<br />Marlin's book -- in concert with other political works on the period -- will help future generations to understand Conservatives' formidable electoral clout in the second half of the 20th Century, even in formerly liberal, urban bastions in the Northeast.  A standout work in this genre is Samuel G. Freeman's &quot;The Inheritance,&quot; published about six years ago (though regrettably out of print the last time I checked).<br />I did downgrade Marlin's book by one notch because of a higher-than-acceptable quotient of typographical errors, especially disappointing for a Christian Brothers-educated scholar.  (Full disclosure: Marlin and I share a college alma mater.)	2002-09-28

To cite one of many examples, an early November Hanson essay posits that Okinawa, rather than Vietnam, is the most apt analogy for the fortified cave fighting in Afghanistan.  This came at a time when so-called informed opinion -- devoid of meaningful historical perspective -- was hysterically, fatuously and irresponsibly drawing Vietnam parallels, and prematurely speculating about quagmires. (See R.W. Apple's infamous \\"news analysis\\" in The New York Times on October 31, 2001.)<br />With reason, keen insight and historical grounding, Hanson asserts that the U.S.'s lack of preparedness and irresolution in the face of mounting terrorist provocations made us vulnerable to the alQaeda attacks on New York and Washington, and offers a compelling argument for achieving total victory -- and not merely partial retribution -- in the ongoing War on Terrorism (including Iraq).<br />With the one-year anniversary once again riveting a spotlight on the 9/11 horror, a reading of \\"An Autumn of War\\" should be part of any thorough retrospective.	2002-09-15

The heroes were, in the main, boys, really -- 20-, 21- and 22-year-olds -- who gallantly battled the conflagration that was quickly engulfing their ship in the Tonkin Gulf. (An accidental rocket launch had triggered a fuel-oil fire that, within 94-seconds, led to the \\"cook-off\\" and explosion of nine, unstable World War II-era, thousand-pound bombs.)<br />Author Gregory Freeman tells a poignant, at times heart-breaking, story.  We see severely injured young men in the steering control, cut off by the spreading inferno and with no hope of rescue, slowly dying, but stoically executing orders until they expired. (\\"They never begged for mercy. They never whined.  They never whimpered.  They were sailors to the end.\\") <BR>We see a young man -- his body charred beyond recognition -- lying in silence and patiently waiting to die, whose last thought is for the palpable saddness of his caregiver: \\"That's okay, you don't have to feel bad. I haven't done anything I'm ashamed of. I'm ready to go.\\"<br />These ordinary, $150-a-month shiphands were the very definition of selflessness.<br />\\"Sailors to the End\\" is highly recommended for anyone looking to celebrate authentic American  heroism.	2002-08-03

I approached this book with only a cursory knowledge of LaGuardia, but came away with an enriched understanding of the Little Flower's far-reaching influence on New York City. <br />I was struck repeatedly by the parallels between LaGuardia and another successful, highly influential Mayor, Giuliani.  Both wielded absolute power (\\"dictatorial,\\" to their detractors), did not brook dissent easily, ran as anti-machine reformers (barely gaining office initially but subsequently amassing larger majorities), assailed corruption and malfeasance, and left New York City a markedly better place than they found it.<br />By his own admission, Jeffers's is NOT the definitive LaGuardia biography.  He writes with broad brushstrokes, painting a colorful, big-picture portrait, and avoiding the pitfalls of needless minutae.  Jeffers also has a talent for placing his subjects in the context of history.  (To wit: LaGuardia spent his formative years in Prescott, Arizona, whose Mayor was the famous Bucky O'Neill of the \\"Rough Riders\\" lore.  During the Spanish-American War, young LaGuardia was a stringer for a St. Louis newspaper, where he was in the company of such legendary war correspondents as Richard Harding Davis and Stephen Crane.)<br />As a result of this style, all of Jeffers's biographies are entertaining, easy to read, and provide a succinct overview to laypersons with a passion for history.  If you fit that description, \\"The Napoleon of New York\\" is for you.	2002-06-01

It's a gripping, edge-of-the-seat narrative told in a style reminiscent of Ambrose, with heavy reliance on first-person recollections.   The book recounts the 1965 Ia Drang Battle, the first set-piece engagement between U.S. and NVA armies in battalion strength.<br />People who've seen the recent, excellent movie may think they know the tale.  But the movie tells only half the story, ending with the conclusion of hostilities at Landing Zone X-Ray.  Left undepicted by Hollywood is the ferocious fighting at Landing Zone Albany, where the U.S. 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry is ambushed and encircled by numerically superior NVA reserve forces.  The description of the LZ-Albany carnage and gallantry is some of the best writing on warfare I have ever encountered.<br />I was pleased to see that the movie (one of my favorites of recent vintage) raised public consciousness of the sacrifices and bravery of our Viet Nam servicemen.  The book makes the case even more poignantly.  Even unpopular wars produce heroes who serve with honor, courage and distinction.  My hat is off to all of them.	2002-05-12

H. Paul Jeffers attempts to redress this unfortunate circumstance with the first book-length biography of the younger Roosevelt (known as Ted).  <br />Brigadier General Ted Roosevelt was the oldest man ashore in the first wave of the Normandy invasion, hobbling on to Utah Beach with the benefit of a walking stick.  This scene is memorably portrayed by Henry Fonda in the D-Day classic, &quot;The Longest Day.&quot;<BR>His determined, steadfast leadership at Normandy earned Ted the Congressional Medal of Honor.  <br />The D-Day heroics were the culmination of a full life that followed a pattern eerily -- and no doubt consciously -- reminiscent of the elder Roosevelt's.  Ted, a highly decorated combat veteran during World War I, attempted to translate his war-time noteriety into a political career.  Lacking his Dad's vote-getting prowess, however, Ted's bid for the New York Governorship was thwarted by the charismatic Al Smith, one of the premier politicans of his era.  Ted never ran for elective office again. Instead, he excelled at volunteerism -- he helped to found the American Legion -- and served with distinction as the appointed Governor of both Puerto Rico and the Philippines.  His benevolent administration of the Philippines in the early 1930s paved the way for that archipelago to achieve independence.<br />Sharing his dad's predilection for outdoor adventure, Ted and his brother, Kermit, together conquered the Himalayan Mountains.  Later, Ted's travels took him to places like the Khyber Pass and Peshawar that are often in the news today.   <br />Like many Americans, Ted Roosevelt initially opposed American involvement in World War II.  But when the clarion call of service sounded, Ted, well into his fifties, rushed headlong into the fray, participating in allied actions in North Africa and Sicily.<br />Roosevelt died of heart failure just weeks after the Normandy Landing, and like his father, was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously.  The Roosevelts joined the MacArthurs as the only father-son MOH winners in American history.<br />I recently &quot;discovered&quot; the author, Paul Jeffers, and find him to be an engaging biographer.  He's also quite prolific.  In the past two years, he's churned out biographies of Grover Cleveland and the Gilded Age denizen, Diamond Jim Brady, in addition to this one on Ted Roosevelt.  And I see where he's slated to unveil a biography of Fiorello LaGuardia later this year.  All the Jeffers biographies are excellent reads that entertain while they enlighten.	2002-04-14

It has been enjoyable to watch the stunning metamorphosis of this grand boulevard over the past decade or so. It was, therefore, with eager anticipation that I picked up this new history of 42nd Street.<br />On one level, it was an enjoyable read, offering illuminating anecdotes such as the encampment of George Washington's troops on the grounds of what is now the New York Public Library during the pivotal Battle of New York.  In the 19th Century, the site would house the Croton Reservoir colossus. On the adjacent property, the Crystal Palace pavallion -- featuring the tallest structure in New York at the time -- became the City's premier social gathering place until it burned down while firefighters futilely tried to draw ground-level water from the high-walled reservoir.  The demise of the Crystal Palace would clear the way for the development of Bryant Park on this site in the period after the Civil War.<br />The book is loaded with fascinating tidbits like these for people who enjoy history.<br />A good portion of the book is devoted to the spreading hegemony of illicit drugs, pornography and crime on West 42nd Street in the period after World War II, and the reclamation of the street in the 1990s.  This is where \\"Down 42nd Street\\" falls down.  The author -- an entertainment writer -- presents several misstatements that seriously tarnish his narrative.  At one point, he asserts that Olympia & York owned Rockefeller Center -- hugh?? -- and contends that in 1981, \\"Governor\\" Cuomo dropped his opposition to the selection of a lead developer after Mayor Koch hinted at challenging the \\"Governor\\" in 1982.  (Cuomo did not become Governor until 1983 following a primary challenge from Koch in the fall of 1982!  Don't they employ factcheckers at Warner Books?)<br />The storyline really becomes muddled when describing the sequence of events in Times Square in 1990s, and it is clear that the author is out of his elementhere.  He creates the appearance that the Conde Nast Building was the last of the four \\"elephant legs\\" in the 42nd Street Redevelopment Plan to be built.  It was the first.  He has Morgan Stanley purchasing its headquarters on Broadway and 49th Street AFTER the groundbreaking on the \\"elephant legs\\" when, in fact, the purchase pre-dated the Conde Nast groundbreaking by at least two years.  He has Bertelsmann -- a true Times Square pioneer -- moving into its Broadway headquarters in 1999, about five years late.  The list could go on.<br />These factual flaws diminish what started out as an enjoyable history.  Caveat Emptor.	2002-03-30

Floyd (\\"Jim\\") Thompson, whose life and family were rent asunder by the Vietnam War and its aftermath.<br />Thompson spent nine arduous years in captivity, including five long years held in solitary by the Viet Cong.  Thompson is the longest-held prisoner of war in American history, although for a variety of reasons (mainly his familiy's insistence on privacy), Navy pilot Everrett Alvarez is often accorded that distinction.<br />Unlike the heroic Navy and Air Force pilots shot down over North Vietnam, Thompson was deprived of the physical and emotional support of fellow Americans who were enduring the same harrowing ordeal.  (Thompson did not even lay eyes on another American for more than four years.)  Instead, he found succor from his faith in God, country, and the wife and family that he thought awaited him.<br />However, these three pillars of faith would prove illusory.  Upon finally achieving freedom, Thompson is unable to recognize the country and family to which he returned, and as the tragedies continued to mount, he soon renounces his religious convictions.<br />Despite being presented with evidence (a voice recording) of her husband's captivity fairly early on, Thompson's wife Alyce had wasted little time merging her young family with another man's, \\"for the sake of the children.\\"  Attempts to restore a normal family life prove disatrous, and Thompson ends up divorced twice, estranged from his children and involuntarily retired from the Army at age 47 due to a stroke.<br />The persistent problems (culminating in a murder conviction)of his youngest child and only son -- born the day after Thompson's capture -- is the lightning rod for a family reconcilation.  Jim even dropped his deep-seated enmity for Alyce.  But the rapprochement proved to be short-lived, and by the story's end, Thompson is once again an embittered, isolated man.<br />Too few Americans know the Col. Jim Thompson story.  This storydeserves to find the widest possible audience.	2002-03-17

That being the case, one could simply skim through the first three-fifths of the book. This comprises a mildly interesting, at times desultory, review of Cap's education at Harvard, service in World War II, early California legislative career, private legal practice, work at Bechtel Corp, and service in both Governor Reagan's and President Nixon's administrations. The accounts of Cap's modestly successful efforts to rein in Federal spending as Nixon's OMB Director and to reform health care while heading HEW don't exactly lend themselves to riveting prose.<br />However, the action and the interest really pick up when Weinberger turns his attention the Reagan administration and his essential role in resuscitating the U.S. military. Particuarly valuable are Weinberger's explanation of the hows and whys behind his metamorphosis from &quot;Cap The Knife&quot; to &quot;Cap The Builder;&quot; his observations on the reasons for the Soviet Union's demise, and his skepticism about Gorbachev's role in that historic event.<br />This is definitely not a memoir in the &quot;kiss-and-tell&quot; genre. Weinberger offers only cursory insights into policy formulation and the battles with Congress over funding. He expresses veneration for most of his former colleagues, including Colin Powell, Don Rumsfeld, Rich Armitage, Frank Carlucci, Will Taft and Jim Webb. He evinces no animus toward George Shultz, saying they often disagreed, especially on the deployment of armed forces, and is only mildly critical of the imperious demeanor of Al Haig. Weinberger reserves his opprobrium for three people: Bud MacFarlane for his ill-considered counsel to Reagan in the arms-for-hostages scheme; Lawrence Walsh for his baseless, heavy-handed witch-hunt during the Iran-Contra investigation; and former President Clinton for hispursuit of a feckless, irresolute foreign policy and excessive de-funding of the armed services.<br />Weinberger's account of his &quot;nightmare&quot; year (1992) makes a cogent argument against the ill-conceived Special Prosecutor statute, an argument that the Congressional Democrats bought into only after the glare of its prosecutorial powers was shone on one of its own. <br />All in all, a fast, engaging read, but one that breaks little new ground.	2002-01-13

(It's too bad he squandered his obviously prodigious talent with the ill-fated &quot;Dutch.&quot;) Of course, the kinetic TR Presidency, like the hyper-energetic man himself, gives Morris considerable raw material with which to work.  Morris paints a compelling picture of President Roosevelt as world statesmen, labor arbiter, social reformer, regulator, conservationist, Monroe Doctrine enforcer, Naval power enthusiast, adroit politician and, of course, canal-building pioneer.  If only he sought a third term!<br />&quot;Theodore Rex&quot; is an all-around terrific read.

Brands posits a novel and provocative twist on this well-worn theory.  To wit: skepticism toward government is the natural condition in America, and the retreat from Post-War liberalism over the past 30 years has merely marked a return to historical normalcy.  Only during war time, Brands argues, do Americans turn to the Federal government for solutions to the nation's problems, and it was the Cold War that allowed government to flower so spectacularly in so many aspects of American life.  The Post-War period was not a cycle, but an &quot;anomaly,&quot; Brands avers.  &quot;The appropriate image was not a pendulum, but a balloon . . . When Vietnam destroyed (Americans') confidence, the balloon deflated, and expectations of government descended to their traditional low level.  Pendulums swing back on their own; balloons require refilling.&quot;<br />While Brands acknowledges that his argument will hearten conservatives and discomfit liberals, he is no right-wing ideologue (as his chapters on Reagan's Presidency will attest).  Rather, he's a distinguished Texas A&amp;M historian and author of highly acclaimed biographies on Theodore Roosevelt and Ben Franklin. <br />By Brands' lights, recent events may, in fact, suggest brighter horizons ahead for believers in government activism.  Only a credible national security threat, he maintains, can refill the balloon, and revive American's faith in government.  That threat, of course, is on us now.  Does that suggest that Wellstone or Daschle or -- heaven forbid -- even Hillary could take up residence at 1600 Pennsylviania Ave come 2005?  Only time will tell.	2001-12-05

We're well acquainted with this quintessentially American success story, and with the deeply patriotic and moralistic ideals which underpinned RR's policies, particularly in the foreign policy sphere.<br />Yet, what makes this book so special is Ms. Noonan's extraordinary gifts for storytelling.  A measure of her formidable talents is her ability to take well-chronicled events -- the hardscrabble Illinois childhood, the SAG and GE years, the 1976 near miss, the PATCO strike, the assassination ordeal, Iran-Contra, the Iceland Summit, etc, etc -- and infuse them with fresh energy and perspective.  <br />As Ms. Noonan recounted RR's clear-eyed, strong-willed, visionary posture vis-a-vis the Soviets, I could not help but reflect on how those qualities have been sorely absent from U.S. foreign policy over the past decade -- and how urgently important they are right now.  Indeed, the book's penultimate chapter is devoted to the lessons George W. Bush absorbed from nearly a decade of watching RR.   <br />&quot;When Character is King&quot; advances Peggy Noonan's reputation as one of the finest political writers of her generation.

If you are looking for an enjoyable book about an interesting historical character, look no further. Paul Jeffers, chronicler of Teddy Roosevelt and Grover Cleveland, reaches back once again to the Gilded Age in painting an entertaining portrait of Diamond Jim Brady. An up-from-the-bootstraps son of an Irish immigrant saloonkeeper, Brady would amass a colossal fortune in the burgeoning railroad and steel industries of the late 19th Century. This colossal fortune he used to cut an imposing figure on the New York City social scene, giving new meaning, in the process, to the concept of &quot;living large.&quot; One New York restaurater dubbed Brady the best 25 customers he ever had. On page after page, Brady plunges into 14-course meals, often in the company of the era's most renowned American actress, Lillian Russell, who routinely matched the rotund Brady plate-for-plate. Jeffers' descriptions of Brady's voracious appetite are worth the price of the book: &quot;He stationed his chair so that there were four inches between the edge of the table and his stomach. Eating ended when the gap had been closed.&quot;<br />There's more to Jeffers'new book than Brady's prodigous eating forays. It's actually an engaging history of New York high society in the period between the Civil War and World War I. Robustly recommended.	2001-11-18

John F. Kennedy was the upstart Congressman with star power: the charismatic war hero with a natural electoral base in the Bay State's sizable Irish Catholic community and plenty of Daddy's money to bolster his campaign. <br />Thomas Whalen tells the story of the election that would catapult Kennedy into national prominence and put him on the road to the White House eight short years later. Whalen explores many reasons for Kennedy's victory, including his assiduous courting of the women's vote, adroit use of the new television medium, and the electorate's strong affinity for an &quot;Irish Brahmin.&quot;<br />Another major factor, according to Whalen, was Lodge's role in helping to engineer the Republican nomination for Dwight Eisenhower at the Republican convention. Lodge, who served as Ike's campaign chairman, earned the eternal enmity of the Taft loyalists, who meted out their retribution by openly siding with his Democratic opponent in the 1952 Senate campaign. Kennedy's position as an avowed Cold Warrior helped to facilitate the flight of Republican conservatives such as the influential newspaper publisher Basil Brewster into the Kennedy camp. Even Ike's superb showing at the top of the ticket -- he won Massachusetts handily -- could not carry the day for Lodge, who would never again hold elective office.<br />Lodge's defeat would signal the beginning of the end of Yankee Republican primacy, and cement Democratic hegemony in the Bay State. After Ike, no Republican Presidential candidate would carry the state again until Reagan in 1984.<br />For the Kennedy clan, the victory was sweet revenge. JFK's maternal grandfather, the irrepressible &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, had failed in a bid for the elder Lodge's Senate seat in 1916. <br />Highly recommended for anyone interested in U.S. politics.	2001-10-20

And Schulman does a reasonably effective job of capturing the social, cultural and political forces that shaped America in that era.  However, Schulman overlooks several events, which, in my mind, are integral to understanding America in the 1970s.<br />The biggest of these is the Iranian hostage crisis.  The U.S. diplomats' humiliating, 444-day captivity underscored in the public mind U.S. impotence on the world stage, while the ill-fated rescue mission highlighted the deleterious effects of the &quot;hollow&quot; military in the aftermath of Viet Nam.  These events lead directly to American voters' repudiation of President Carter.  Schulman fails to even mention the hostage crisis in his analysis of the 1980 election, ascribing Reagan's trouncing of Carter to economic issues alone.  (In my mind, economic factors and the hostage situation contributed equally to the Reagan landslide and the rout of old liberal stalwarts like McGovern, Bayh and Church in the Senate.)<br />Similarly, the ignominious fall of Saigon in 1975 and America's abandonment of loyal allies -- dramatized by South Viet Namese desperately clinging to fleeing U.S. choppers -- lowered U.S. prestige, lead to increasing self-doubt at at home, and emboldened our enemies abroad. (For a cogent analysis of the effects on American psyche and world position, see David Frum's excellent chronicle -- &quot;How We Got Here.&quot;) Schulman eschews any detailed discussion of this tragic event.<br />Finally, Schulman spends inordinant time on 1970s musical trends -- from the vapid, ephemeral disco craze to punk and New Wave to country to the emerging rap genre.  He dissects the impact of a broad range of artists: Bob Dylan and Country Joe McDonald; Donna Summer and the Bee Gees; the Ramones, the Talking Heads, the Clash, and even Peter Frampton -- to cite just a few.  Yet Schulman neglects to mention the premier songwriter of the 1969-1984 epoch:  Bruce Springsteen, who better than anyone, articulated the hardscrabble 1970s existence of blue collar America.

While such tactics would become de rigueur in military circles, they were virtually unheard of in the &quot;gentlemanly&quot; warfare of the 19th Century.<BR>We learn that at the Civil War's end, Sherman was a man reviled in both the South and the North. The South, because of his &quot;scortched earth&quot; trek through Georgia and the Carolinas, and the North because of the lenient terms of surrender he offered to Joe Johnston. It was only his close relationship with U.S. Grant that saved Sherman's military career and lead to his ascendance to Commanding General, a post he would hold for more than a decade. Kennett's work is biography, not military history. Therefore, readers looking for intricate detail on Sherman's battlefield exploits and tactical decision-making will come away disappointed.	2001-09-23

I find him to be an accomplished military historian, with a clear, concise writing style, and a unique talent for making complex military operations understandable to the layman.<br />Eisenhower has succeeded once again with &quot;Yanks,&quot; his account of the organization of the American Expeditionery Force and its performance during World War I. While a previous reviewer bemoans a surfeit of books on this topic, in my mind, World War I has been eclipsed by the continuing explosion of popular books on World War II. Thus, Eisehower's book is a welcome change of pace. <br />Eisenhower observes that the 20th century's two world wars can actually be understood as two phases of the same war, with a continuum existing between the doughboys of 1918 and the G.I.'s of 1942. Indeed, Eisenhower shows the surprising degree to which the army organized by General Pershing formed the basis for the U.S. army structure in World War II (commanded by the author's father).<br />I found particularly incisive Eisenhower's assertion that the second world war might have been avoided had the political leaders of 1918-19 heeded the wisdom of General Pershing. It was Pershing's view that no armistice should be granted while the Germans still occupied French and Belgian soil. However, the objective of unconditional surrender was anathema to the French and British, who had no stomach for prolonging hostilities after five years of horrific losses. Had the German army been annhilated completely and its homeland occupied (ie., the approach of the allies in World War II), Germany may have been deprived of the means of instigating war some 20 years later. <br />If you are as fond of &quot;Yanks&quot; as I am, I would enthusiastically recommend any of the following Eisenhower titles to you: &quot;A Bitter Wood&quot; (Battle of the Bulge); &quot;So Far From God&quot; (the U.S.-Mexican War) and &quot;Agent ofDestiny&quot; (biography of General Winfield Scott, the first and only five-star general between Washington and Grant).	2001-08-11

James Webb, a foremost author, Vietnam combat veteran and future Secretary of the Navy, presents a moving and incisive allegory in the life experiences of three 1951 U.S. Naval Academy graduates. Red Lescynski, Judd Smith and Joe Dingenfelder are &quot;blood brothers&quot; who swear an oath of allegiance to their country and each other. But their lives are destined to be sundered by the epochal changes sweeping the country: economic dislocation, an epidemic of divorce and fractured families and, most of all, societal and political divisions wrought by U.S. policy in Vietnam. Particularly insightful is the ongoing dialogue between Smith, a conservative Republican, and the ultra-liberal Dorothy Dingenfelder (Joe's estranged wife), who clash repeatedly and vociferously. Red Lesczynski's brutal plight in North Vietnam POW camps are heart rending, as are his difficulties assimilating into a fundamentally changed American society after a seven-year absence. Webb's descriptions of the opprobrious conduct of the anti-war movement are priceless.<br />We are fortunate that 18 years after its initial publication, the U.S. Navy's publishing arm has re-published &quot;A Country Such As This,&quot; enabling a new generation of Americans to benefit from Webb's sage wisdom.	2001-07-14

Bellows another: &quot;means nothing to me either, I'm a Harvard man.&quot; &quot;It doesn't mean anything to me,&quot; responds Al Smith, &quot;I'm an FFM.&quot; What's FFM? &quot;Fulton Fish Market,&quot; Smith says. &quot;Now can we return to the debate?&quot;<br />This is just one of the colorful anecdotes that lace Robert Slayton's excellent chronicle of Al Smith's rise from &quot;The Sidewalks of New York&quot; (his adoptive campaign theme song) to the New York Statehouse and beyond. Here's another story that caught my fancy. As Governor, Al visits a local elitist who's opposed to the expansion of public parklands on Long Island. &quot;It will just bring more rabble from the City,&quot; the elitist protests. &quot;Rabble? I'm the rabble,&quot; Smith rejoins.<br />My interest in Al Smith was recently piqued by the PBS &quot;History of New York&quot; documentary (episodes #4 and #5), and I picked up Mr. Slayton's new biography looking to learn more about this seminal public figure. Mr. Slayton delivered everything I expected and more: Smith, the street-wise Lower Eastsider who rises to Tammany leadership; the reformer who crusades for life-safety codes and work rules revisions in the wake of the deadly Triangle Shirtwaist Factory inferno; the four-term Governor who achieves landmark administrative reforms and inveighs against Prohibition; his pathbreaking, but deeply disappointing 1928 Presidential campaign; his foray into the private sector and the construction of the Empire State Building -- just in time for the Great Depression; and Smith's bitter falling out, and eventual rapprochement with FDR.<br />All in all, it's quite a fascinating life.	2001-06-28

Hampton Sides has resurrected a long-forgotten story of the liberation of Bataan Death March survivors from a POW camp in the Philippines. <br />What makes the narrative especially gripping is Sides' skillful technique of alternating the storyline between the pitiful fate of the U.S. soldiers held in captivity, and the cunning preparation and daring execution of plans to liberate them three years later.<br />For me, the book was truly eye opening in more ways than one.  Not far from my parents' Connecticut home, there's a highway named after Colonel Henry Mucci.  I had often wondered who he was and what he'd done to merit such acclaim.

Along the way, Ronald Radosh introduces us to an assortment of famous (some would say &quot;infamous&quot;) and semi-famous champions of socialist thinking with whom he comes into contact: Paul Robeson, Bob Dylan, Tom Hayden, Irving Howe, Biannca Jagger, to name just a few.<br />As time progresses, we see Radosh increasingly questioning the double-speak, double standards (Classically, there is the socialist who defends lobotomy policies in Castro's Cuba by distinguishing between &quot;Capitalist Lobotomies and Socialist Lobotomies.&quot;) and anti-Americanism that were (and still are) the hallmarks of the Left. <br />But it would be Radosh's groundbreaking work on the Rosenberg Trial (which proved conclusively the guilt of Julius and the complicity of Ethel) that would cause the first fissures in Radosh's relationship with his Leftist comrades.  His subsequent broadsides against the Sandanistas, the Stalinst rulers of Nicaragua, would result in Radosh's excommunication from  the Left and make him a virtual pariah in the academic community.   <br />Radosh's journey parallels the similar life course of David Horowitz, another 1960s radical with the courage and conviction to repudiate long held assumptions.

Given Johnson's lopsided majority -- the largest landslide to that point in U.S. history -- the 1964 contest would appear, on the surface, to be uninteresting.  However, 1964 was pivotal not for who won, but who lost and why.  Perlstein, an avowed Leftist himself, adroitly recounts the rise of the new Conservative movement, which flexed its political muscles for the first time with the nomination of Barry Goldwater.  Ironically, as Perstein shows, pundit after pundit proclaimed the Conservative movement stillborn following Goldwater's pitiful 27-million vote total (compared with Johnson's 43 million).  It would be, Perlstein points out, one of the greatest political misjudgments in U.S. history, as the next 30 years would attest.<br />&quot;Before the Storm&quot; has much to commend it.  A few of the more interesting anecdotes include:<br />* Clifton White's brilliant, secretive Draft Goldwater campaign and his tactical genius in out-flanking the Rockefeller/Scranton/Lodge partisans at the convention;<br />* the internecine struggle for the soul of the young Conservative Movement between Welch's John Birch Society and Buckley's National Review;<br />* the rise of the Young Americans for Freedom, which would dwarf its better known liberal counterpart, Students for a Democratic Society;<br />* the role of Bill Moyers, the holier-than-thou PBS personality, in pioneering a new advertising genre: the political attack ad.<br />* the dramatic political debut of Ronald Reagan, with his acclaimed &quot;A Time for Choosing&quot; speech -- broadcast nationally on election eve.<br />  I could go on and on.  &quot;Before the Storm&quot; is neither a paean to, nor an attack on, the Conservative Movement.  Rather, Perstein's account is thorough, well researched and even handed. A MUST read for political fans ofall stripes.	2001-06-09

Mr. Bowden recounts the story of how the notorious international narco-gangster was finally brought to heel by a combination of Colombian law enforcement agencies, the U.S. DEA and Army Delta Force (which provided critical training and surveillance technology), and importantly, Escobar's rivals in the cocaine cartel. The vigilante terrorism visited upon the infrastructure of Escobar's empire by his cocaine cartel rivals (equally as vicious as Pablo himself) -- with the tacit sanction of the Colombian government -- was the critical factor in the eventual tracking down and killing of Pablo following an off-and-on-again three-year manhunt. <br />This book is included in the &quot;Wall Street Journal's&quot; review (Friday, May 18) of the better reads of the Summer of 2001.

Jay Winik brings the denouement of the Civil War to life with the crisp, eloquent prose of a novelist and the exacting standards and rich detail of an historian.<br />The fateful decisions rendered in April 1865 -- perhaps the most momentous month in our Republic's history -- would help to transform a loosely connected confederation of independent states into a full-fledged, united nation. (In its early years, the United States was commonly used as a plural noun, Winik observes, becoming a singular noun only after the Civil War.)<br />It did not have to turn out this way.  In fact, secessionist proclivities had been deeply embedded in the American experience, Winik points out, citing examples such as the Whiskey Rebellion, the threatened severance of New England during the War of 1812 and the South over the nullification law machinations. That the Civil War would forever lay to rest secessionist impulses -- and as important, not degenerate into a protracted campaign of low-level bloodletting and on-going recrimination (as many other civil wars have) -- is, Winik says, largely due to the words and deeds of men like Lee, Lincoln, Johnston, Grant and Sherman during the pivotal days of April 1865.  It was Lincoln, Grant and Sherman who, time and again, chose reconciliation over retribution, while Lee and Johnston charted a path of honorable surrender (rather than prolonged guerrilla conflict) and wholehearted Union re-embrace.<br />Winik's new work is a masterful achievement -- certainly among the best books lining my bookshelf.  Another classic is Winik's 1996 account of the U.S. triumph in the Cold War: &quot;On The Brink.&quot; Fans of &quot;April 1865&quot; may want to check it out.	2001-04-21

The rapid-fire progression of events includes the fall of the Southern citadel of Richmond; Lee's last-gasp attempt to link up with Johnston's forces in North Carolina; Lincoln's far-sighted  River Queen edict (advising lenient treatment of former Confederates after years of Total Warfare); the capitulation of Lee's once-mighty (and still dangerous) Army of Northern Virginia, Grant's benevolent terms of surrender, and the poignant Stacking of Arms at Appomattox; Lincoln's brutal assassination four days later and the failed conspiracy to decapitate the Union government; Lee's equanimity in defeat and his urgings for a peaceful re-incorporation in the Union; the manhunt for and slaying of the contempible Booth and the execution of his co-conspirators; Johnston's decision to ignore exhortations (from Davis and others) to prolong the conflict, and the magnanimous surrender fashioned by the warrior Sherman; the domino-like falling in line of other Rebel commanders like Forrest and Taylor.<br />From the rush of these events, a unified nation would emerge, and, Winik observes, the U.S. would be spared the prospect of continued partisan conflict and debilitating strife and division -- a fate that has beset so many other war-scarred nations.<br />Get this book and enjoy it.  It's an excellent exposition of the role of the Civil War in forging a truly United States of America.	2001-04-21

Throughout this 36-year period, only Jimmy Carter was able to amass even 50% of the vote, a rather tepid showing, coming as it did, less than two years after the national nightmare of Watergate and Ford's wildly unpopular pardon of Nixon.<br />All in all, it's been a precipitous come down for the proud party of FDR and Truman and JFK.<br />Ronald Radosh opens a window on the problems that have plagued the national Democratic Party these many years.  In an incisive history penned prior to the 1996 election, he traces the demise of the Democratic majority to the Party's capture by Far Left, or New Politics, factions that would dominate its agenda from the late 1960s to the advent of Clinton in the early 1990s.<br />Radosh's book is an excellent chronicle of a Party that lost touch with its core constituencies, and as it moved increasingly to placate highly vocal Radicals on its Left fringe, encouraged the en masse defection of Middle Class voters, some of whom have never returned.<br />The increasing Far-Left tilt of the Democractic Party in the 1970s and 1980s engendered a realignment that continues to affect the political landscape two decades later.	2001-04-10

His roster of heroes includes:<br />-- President Truman. After initially toeing the accommodationist line of FDR, Truman soon recognized the expansionist ambitions of the Soviet Union and reacted accordingly. His Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, Greece and Turkey aid package stopped the spread of Marxist hegemony in its tracks and set the contours for the four-decade struggle that was to come.<br />-- Winston Churchill. In and out of office, he warned early and often of the rising Bolshevik threat. But like his earlier forebodings about Hitler, his alarms fell largely on deaf ears. It was not until the 1980s that the West pursued Cold War strategies that can truly be called Churchillian -- with predictable results.<br />-- Konrad Adenauer. As the first Chancellor of the Republic of Germany, he planted the vital country squarely in the Western camp. West Germany was the crucible of the Cold War. Lacking a leader of Adenauer's resolve and conviction, that country could have easily fallen under the Soviet orbit, or, as Stalin designed, opted for a feckless, hollow &quot;neutrality.&quot; <br />-- Solzhenitsyn. In Shattan's words, he &quot;re-moralized the struggle&quot; after Viet Nam and other setbacks cast doubt on the West's Containment policies. His seminal writings, especially &quot;The Gulag Archipealgo,&quot; laid bare the repressive underpinnings of the Soviet system, while his public outrage at detente opened many eyes in the West.<br />-- Pope John Paul II -- The first non-Italian Pontiff in some 400 years came around at a most propitious moment. (Andropov and other Soviet paranoids contended that the Pope's selection was engineered by the U.S.) Lech Walesa credits Pope John Paul II with &quot;saving Solidarity&quot; -- the counter-revolutionary movement that administered the first schisms in the Soviet armor --and in inspiring hisfellow Poles in their stuggle to shake off the yoke of Communist domination.<br />-- President Reagan. He foresaw the demise of the Soviet Union at a time when many saw history moving inexorably away from the West. Beginning in the 1970s, he called Communism a failed and failing system that would ultimately be trumped by the West -- heretic words to Western leaders who thought befriending the Soviets was the best way to change their behavior. As President, he pursued policies (Churchill's) expressly designed to exacerbate the tensions within the Soviet system. The Berlin Wall was toppled (it did not &quot;fall&quot;; it was pushed) less than 10 months after he left office.<br />Shattan's work is required reading for anyone interested in learning how the Cold War began -- and ended.	2001-03-24

Where &quot;Chancellorsville 1863&quot; and &quot;Not War, But Murder&quot; focus on individual battles -- and do so superbly -- &quot;Ashes of Glory&quot; is as much social as military history.  The book captures the emotions and experiences of the Richmond population throughout the war's five-year ordeal.  Along the way, we meet an eclectic cast of characters: well known leaders like Lee and Jeff Davis; fire and brimstone editorial writers; Union loyalists; brothel madames; aristocrats-turned-hospital-care-givers, and just ordinary folk.  One of the most interesting is Elizabeth Van Lew, a Unionist whose selfless (often brazen) acts of courage earn the eternal gratitude of Commanding General U.S. Grant.<br />Furgurson is an exceptional writer and storyteller.  However,  his true talent is in spicing his narrative with compelling anecdotes that bring his story to life.  Especially poignant is his description of the defeated Lee's return to Richmond following Appomattox.  The clandestine efforts to reclaim the body of a Union officer killed during a putative mission to assassinate Confederate leaders is another sparkling gem.<br />&quot;Ashes of Glory&quot; will make for engaging reading for anyone interested in U.S. history.	2001-03-24

However, I was a fan of Feinstein's previous college hoops books -- &quot;A March to Madness&quot; and &quot;A Season on the Brink&quot; -- and this struck me as an uncanny subject.  Although the book ostensibly chronicles the 1999-2000 season, Feinstein actually transports us back in time. The Patriot League is college basketball the way it used (and ought) to be -- before TV and avarice transformed the sport into a proving ground for the NBA and a cash-cow for the universities.  The kids in the Patriot League play not to audition for the pros, but for the love of the game and the challenge of the competition.  Feinstein brings to life the excitement that small-time college basketball can generate -- every bit as electric as the ACC and Big Ten.	2001-01-26

Certainly, we are provided some basic details on his upbringing, personal life, and political campaigns.  However, the overwhelming focus is on Senator Dirksen as a practitioner of &quot;supra-partisan&quot; politics, a term Hulsey coins to capture the period of political consensus and harmony that extended from the late 1950s through most of the 1960s.  Hulsey depicts, time and again, how Dirksen, the   Republican leader in the Senate, collaborated with the Democratic Kennedy and Johnson administrations to forge legislation and advance America's interests during the Cold War.<br />The election of Richard Nixon in 1968, Hulsey observes, ended the supra-partisan consensus, and ushered in a new period of acrimony and heated partisan division that continue to mark public life to this day.  The ascension of a younger generation of legislators -- less deferential to the genteel traditions of the Senate -- and the aggressive Investigative Journalism ethic were contributing factors in the demise of supra-partisianship.<br />Fittingly, Hulsey observes, three major exponents of supra-partisanship passed from the public stage within a year of each other -- LBJ through retirement and Eisenhower and Dirksen through death.<br />This book opens a window on a bygone era, and will make for enjoyable reading for anyone interested in the workings of Washington, DC in the 1950s and 1960s.	2001-01-06

He puts his considerable talents to excellent use in his comprehensive, captivating account of the Battle of Chancellorsville.<br />With vivid prose, Furgurson -- a descendant of Civil War veterans -- recounts the tactical brilliance of Lee and Jackson that enables the Confederacy to repeatedly carry the day despite the formidable advantages in manpower, resources and battlefield position held by the Union forces.  What the Union lacks, of course, are Lee and Jackson, and Furgurson captures the failure of Union command in all its ignominy.  &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Hooker, we learn, is hardly worthy of the sobriquet.   His penchant for the bottle, Furgurson asserts, is at least partly responsible for Hooker's hesitancy to follow through on the success of his opening gambit, and his reluctance to deploy his forces on hand to full effect. <br />Conversely, Lee's brazen decision, on three separate occasions, to divide his army in the face of superior Union forces -- flouting all conventional military doctrine -- leads to what Furgurson calls Lee's &quot;supreme moment.&quot;  But in the Chancellorsville triumph are planted the seeds of the South's debacle at Gettysburg, the battle that just two months hence, would turn the tide of the war.  The Chancellorsville conflict, Furgurson observes, would deprive Lee of his most audacious, like-minded battlefield commander, and lead to an excess of hubris . . . the belief that Lee's troops &quot;if properly lead,&quot; were invincible.  <br />Military history can at times be a ponderous read.  In Furgurson's hands, it reads like an eloquent novel.	2001-01-01

'This is fantasy from Hollywood ... Star Wars,' they cried. Missile defense was in trouble on Capitol Hill from the moment of announcement.<br />But in one place, people were paying serious attention: Moscow. And that's what counted in the long run.  A number of Soviet sources have since reported that . . . the Kremlin (was) thrown into turmoil by Reagan's idea.  They were not sure that Reagan could make good on the idea, bu they knew that they could not.  To them, itwas less important whether SDI would work than if it could work.  The U.S. had challenged them to a race they could not win.  Rather than bankrupt themselves trying, they left the game.<br />Former Soviet foreign minister Aleksandr Bessmertnykh told a Princeton University conference in 1993 that SDI 'made us realize we were in a very dangerous spot.'  The proposal, he said, accelerated the collapse of the Soviet Union . . . Margaret Thatcher (said) 'Reagan's decision to go ahead with SDI ended the arms race as we knew it.  SDI was the most important initiative of the Reagan Presidency.'&quot;<br />Yes, Reagan supporters are chagrined at authors like Ms. FitzGerald, who cannot grasp the significance of Reagan's strategy to end the Cold War.  But we find solace in Reagan's rising stature in history.  A new poll of eminent historians (all political persuasions represented) ranked Reagan #8 among Presidents in U.S. history.  The judgment of history will be much more painful for Ms. FitzGerald and people of her ilk who buy into the drivel she's serving up.	2000-11-18

However, that same year, the seeds of liberalism's demise were being planted in the nation's (soon to be) most populous state. Author Matthew Dalleck provides a brilliant, even-handed account of the decline of post-War liberalism, symbolized by Ronald Reagan's one-million-vote trouncing of incumbent Edmund &quot;Pat&quot; Brown in the California Governor's race of 1966. Few U.S. politicians better embodied the ideals and aspirations of post-War liberalism than Brown, the liberal icon who had roundly defeated Richard Nixon in 1962 and William Knowland, another conservative of national stature, in 1958. But as the social unrest of the Sixties began to take hold, Brown would come to represent not only the virtues of liberalism, but its failures and shortcomings as well. Mr. Dalleck recounts how Ronald Reagan and a coterie of Calilfornia conservatives exploited liberalism's deficiencies to vanquish Gov. Brown (who would remain forever embittered by the experience), re-energize the conservative movement nationally and begin the process that would culminate with Reagan's two terms as President in the Eighties. Despite its far-reaching magnitude, relatively little has been written about the California Gubernatorial election of 1966, making Dalleck's new book essential reading for all students of modern U.S. history.	2000-09-30

Yet at truly critical junctures, the voting public has shown an uncanny  knack for electing leaders who were ideally suited for the challenges of  the times. Certainly, that was the case in 1932, with the election of FDR,  and again in 1980, with the rise to prominence of Ronald Reagan. <br />The  origin of the demise of the Iron Curtain -- and ultimate break-up of the  Soviet Union -- can be traced to Reagan's arrival on the world geopolitical  stage in the early 1980s.  Author Peter Schweizer provides copious evidence  for how the Reagan Administration's policies contributed to the collapse of  the USSR.  Some of these policies included: covert support for Afghan  rebels and the Polish underground; the unprecedented military build-up and  technology commitment (including SDI); the efforts to stem technology  transfers and subsidized financial credits to Eastern Bloc nations, and  significantly, to hobble the development of the Siberian natural gas   pipeline; the &quot;special relationship&quot; forged with the Saudis,  which ultimately led to the precipitous decline in oil prices (costing the  USSR billions in lost hard currency).<br />Reagan's policy of active  confrontation with the Soviet Union was a stark departure from bi-partisan  orthodoxy, which had attempted to &quot;accommodate,&quot; or, at best,  &quot;contain&quot; Soviet expansion.	2000-08-14

But he fails to address at all legitimate (documented)  instances of subversion.  Ethel and Julius Rosenberg merit not even a  mention.  We learn only that Alger Hiss was &quot;persecuted&quot; by  Nixon, but hear nothing about his nefarious activities.<br />The CIA is  portrayed as modern day Keystone Cops, bumblers whose every success is the  result of fortuity or happenstance.  Somehow, President Kennedy skirts any  blame for the Bay of Pigs fiasco.<br />Bill Buckley's Conservative Revolution  is basically cast as a failure, despite the fact that most of its main  precepts have been co-opted by Clinton and a Conservative majority governs  the Congress at Century's end for the first time since the 1920s.  <br />The  Sixties counter culture is lauded, with nary a mention of any unintended  consequences (rampant drug use, unwanted pregnancies, demise of authority)  that it unleashed.<br />The encomium to President Clinton is almost laughable.	2000-07-30

Once in office, he blazed  a trail uniquely his own: pro-gold standard, anti-tariff, pro-rule-of-law,  anti-government activism.  <br />More than 100 years after the fact,  Cleveland's viewpoints are often startling.

US	51701483	RV0NQSHCFHNC3	0060393408	962636193	The Case Against Hillary Clinton	Books	5	10	21	N	N	masterful	ANY book written by Peggy Noonan is well worth reading.  I've read them all and find her to be a thoughful, insightful wordsmith.  In her latest book, she presents a concise, compelling argument for why HRC -- and  Clintonism -- should be permanently retired from public life. One can only  hope (pray! ) that New Yorkers are paying attention.	2000-05-06

Imagine: a war correspondent who brazenly leads his comrades out of an ambush, only to bravely return -- unarmed -- in a futile effort  save more of his trapped colleagues.  Captured, he plots and executes a  daring escape -- succeeding where professional soldiers cannot.  His hunger  for adventure not yet sated, he returns to the battle field, knowing full  well that his re-capture will mean certain death.<br />They just don't make  leaders like this any more!<br />The downside in this book -- considerable in  my opinion -- is the poor (I've elected a charitable adjective) quality of  the writing.  Ms. Sandys would definitely have been well served by having a  professional writer as her collaborator.	2000-04-29

Very readable.  However, I was irked by several factual errors, which, in my opinion, are inexcusable in a history book.  (For example, former GOP Minority Whip Bob Michel was from Illinois, not  Indiana.  Richard Nixon died in 1994, not 1993.  There are several others  that struck me while reading but that I cannot recall now.) One my consider  such factual mistakes as &quot;no big deal.&quot;  However, I cannot help  wondering what other errors there are that I am just not aware of.	2000-04-29

This is an excellent character portrait of a noble, honorable and admirable man.  Well written, this book positions Lombardi within the  context of his times.  You find a man fiercely committed to perfection, to  doing the right thing, to integrity and country.  Without doubt, one of the  best books I've ever read.	2000-02-27

One extraordinary man was pincipally responsible for thwarting that ambition:  Winston Churchill.<br />The author, John Lukacs, asserts that Great Brtain was incapable of defeating Hitler in 1940.  But  Britain and Churchill accomplished something just as important: they did  not LOSE WWII by descending down the &quot;slippery slope&quot; of  accommodation with Hitler.<br />This book demonstrates why, without doubt,  Churchill was THE person of the 20th Century.	2000-02-12

It shines a spotlight on an interesting time in American life -- the tail end of the Roaring 20s and the onset of the Great Depression -- and the long-cherished  &quot;spoils&quot; system of municipal government.<br />Many larger-than-life  characters are here: FDR, Jimmy Walker, Fiorello LaGuardia, Al Smith.   Smith's metamorphosis from trail-blazing liberal to the anti-Roosevelt in  four short years was particularly eye-opening for me. (In school, they only  taught us about the &quot;Happy Warrior&quot;of 1928, conveniently  foregoing the not-so-happy iteration of 1932 and beyond.) I was also struck  by the enmity toward the pre-presidential FDR which was evident in many  quarters.	2000-02-05

This is an exceptional account of a pivotal -- though largely neglected -- moment in US history.  I came away with renewed respect for Andrew Jackson and his band of &quot;dirty shirts.&quot;  As I read this book,I could not  help thinking that it lends itself perfectly to a Hollywood adaptation  along the lines of &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and &quot;The Rough Riders.&quot;	2000-01-01

The ideological struggle between expansionist totalitarianism and the freedom of the West  is the defining episode of our lifetimes. Germany was the crucible of that  struggle.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their  knowledge of the titanic struggle that was the Cold War.<br />PS -- This book  has introduced me to a new hero for whom I now have the utmost respect:  US  Gen. Lucious Clay, who played a central role in both the Berlin Airlift of  1948 and the Berlin Wall crisis and aftermath of 1961, etc. Please e-mail  me at the address above if you can offer details on the life of this  genuine American hero.	1999-12-25

First, I agree with the previous posters who are critical of the author's writing style.  He is just not a very cogent writer and has a difficult time organizing his thoughts.   However, if you stick with it -- and work through the slow, meandering  parts (of which there are plenty) -- this book tells a truly remarkable  story.  As you read it, you have to keep reminding yourself that all this  senseless carnage and the atrocities on all sides really occurred in the  mid 20th Century -- not some ancient, &quot;barbaric&quot; time.<br />This  book illuminated a great deal about what is truly one of the transcendant  events of the 20th Century -- the turning point in the war that defined the  second half of the century.<br />So here's my recommendation:  If you want to  be &quot;entertained,&quot; you probably should pass on  &quot;Stalingrad;&quot; if you want to be educated, then I think you'll  find the book first-rate.	1999-12-25

Its affirmation of faith, family, honor and country -- even in the face of truly horrific experiences -- is an inspiration.<br />What most impresses is McCain's total  lack of rancor torward his captors.  Their actions would have earned the  eternal wrath of lesser men, including myself.   In an era littered with  ersatz heros and false icons, McCain is the genuine article.	1999-09-07
