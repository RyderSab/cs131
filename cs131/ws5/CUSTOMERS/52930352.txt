Dobbs, an independent woman making her way as a freelance psychologist and investigator, is asked to determine the fate of two men missing in action during the war, one an aviator and the other a soldier, but both possibly linked to dangerous intelligence work on or behind the front line.<br /><br />Dobbs has good reason to be concerned about taking on these seemingly innocous tasks. She served as a battlefield nurse, and what she saw and did -- revealed to the reader only in glimpses -- threatens to destroy the defenses she has worked so hard to build up since the war.<br /><br />Dobbs prefers to work alone, so stretches of the novel are given over to her introspections. It's a slow-paced novel as we follow her to a grand English country home, her journey across the channel to France, and her visit to a small village, where she encounters both a spritely 14-year-old girl, seemingly untouched by the war, and the secrets that lead her to the solution.<br /><br />\\"Pardonable Lies\\" is a fine look at a young woman making her way amid the economic and social dislocations of 1930s Britain. It falters only when the cliches of the mystery genre surface. Some people fear what she may uncover, so Maisie is threatened and attempts on her life are made, but they are easily foreseen by the reader, and it seems like even Maisie is only distracted by the threats. She has more important things on her mind. Strip away the genre's trappings, and \\"Pardonable Lies\\" is a reflection, a meditation even, on how those of us who have experienced war carry with us the scars that can reopen in an instant.	2005-08-09

Over the 10 novels in Michael Connelly's series, the angst-ridden LAPD detective has exorcised more demons than a Catholic priest. He's battled trauma from his time as a tunnel rat in Vietnam, investigated his mother's death and discovered that one of his girlfriends bore his daughter. He's been suspected of murder, stalked by a serial killer and thrown off the force.<br /><br />With all that resolved, that may be why the 11th Bosch novel, \\"The Closers,\\" tightly written and full of twists and turns as usual, seems to be missing something.<br /><br />The title refers to the newly formed cold-case squad Bosch joins after returning to the LAPD. His job is to reopen cases in which DNA technology has found a possible suspect. Bosch and his partner, Kiz Rider, are assigned to investigate the 1988 murder of a 16-year-old girl who vanished from her parent's home one night and shot to death in the nearby hills. A DNA match was made between a scrap of flesh found on the murder weapon and a punk who'd lived in the area around the time of the murder. But more evidence is needed, so Bosch and Rider track down those who knew the girl.<br /><br />As a former reporter with connections with the LAPD, Connelly packs his novels with inside information. In \\"The Closers,\\" we learn that a two-six call refers to a meeting with the chief of police, how computers are used to track people, and that private companies help police set up wiretaps. Connelly's the best PR for the department since the days of \\"Dragnet.\\"<br /><br />But after closing \\"The Closers,\\" I kept thinking, \\"Is that it?¨ Connelly has said that he wants to focus on the impact violence has on the survivors, but because the story is told from Bosch's point of view, we only see them when he does. They're off-stage for most of the book, which drains the juice out of the novel's climax. How can we feel for the victims when we're only seeing them from inside Harry Bosch's head?	2005-05-19

Kanon describes the scene with the eye of a tourist, and its people with the knowledge of an insider, giving us lyrical descriptions like this one: \\"Above all, the city was still beautiful, every turn of a corner a painting, the wa­ter a soft pastel in the early evening, before the lamps came on.\\"<br /><br />Kanon has written several historical thrillers -- I especially loved \\"Los Alamos,\\" set in the complex that begat the atomic bomb -- and he has an eye for creating stories that pose complex moral questions and whose reso­lutions are often messy and ambiguous. He's the thriller writer for intelligent readers.	2005-05-10

She is of the minimalist school, and \\"Wait Until Midnight\\" is as grounded in the late Victorian period as Quick's previous books were in the Regency, which is to say not much. In fact, if you didn't know, they could have taken place in the same year, so similar they are in its preoccupations with the Quality, its balls, its carriages, maids, and romances.<br /><br />In \\"Wait Until Midnight,\\" Caroline Fordyce supports herself and the two aunts who raised her by penning \\"sensational\\" novels for a newspaper. While researching the spiritualism craze for her next work, she encounters Adam Hardesty, who's hunting for a diary that reveals his family's secrets. His trail crosses Caroline's as well as two mediums, one of who is found murdered, wearing a wedding veil and found beside a crushed watch, its hands stopped at midnight.<br /><br />Where Quick excells is in her plotting, throwing in curves that freshen the standard story. Caroline is a popular writer with a secret past, and who masquerades as a widow but in reality a virgin. She is pursued, first as a suspect, then as a lover, by Adam, the brooding, virile hero who lives by his own rules, but is startled, then discomforted to discover that she's been strip-mining his personality to create the villain of her latest penny dreadful.<br /><br />Given these limitations, Quick keeps the plots spinning, the romance heated, and manages to come up with an appropriately creepy climax.	2005-03-01

They're fast-paced, traditional mysteries that are meant solely to entertain and keep alive the memory of the TV series starring Dick Van Dyke as the crime-solving Dr. Mark Sloan.<br /><br />Suicides haunt the fourth novel in the series. Dr. Sloan has as patients an actress who has beaten cancer several times but who refuses to quit smoking, and a woman who he saw jumping from a fifth-floor window but survived. Both resist Mark's efforts to help them, and he wants to know why. In addition, his son is investigating the death of a publisher of an extreme-sports magazine, who died from a knife in the chest during a parachute jump.<br /><br />Goldberg was a producer on the series, so he has a thorough knowledge of the characters. Like their TV counterparts, they banter, argue and sass each other, sometimes sidetracking serious conversations into something that sounds like, well, a TV show. There's Steve the detective, caging bear claws from a baker visiting the injured jumper, or a conversation stopping dead because someone says \\"hinky\\" (\\"I watched a lot of seventies cop shows\\" / \\"That explains your hair.\\").<br /><br />Those who like their mysteries earnest will crab about realism. I find these quirks human. Maybe its because I like bear claws.<br /><br />\\"Waking Nightmare\\" is a tightly plotted mystery that contains several plot twists and series of false solutions in the Agatha Christie tradition. Goldberg effortlessly carries over the flavor of the series to the written word, so if you liked the show, you'd probably like the books.	2005-02-28

Dr. Mark Sloan's reputation for solving crimes lands him on a cold-case squad, but he learns that its only going to be used as a PR screen. Nevertheless, his curiosity gets him involved in what appears to be a solved murder, only to deduce that it's not.<br /><br />\\"The Silent Partner\\" delivers an interesting story, letting you spend some time with familiar, likeable characters. Sloan and his friends and co-workers come across as idealized, but real characters. While they're all decent people, they get upset, make mistakes, and Dr. Sloan can be a real pain in the tuchus. In one scene, he's trying to prove that a bottle cap found at the scene of several murders is a vital clue, and you can understand the chief of police's point of view: \\"Uh huh, right, don't you have any house calls, doctor?\\"<br /><br />It may be faint praise to call \\"The Silent Partner\\" a competent mystery that appears to have been dashed off, but it takes a lot of work and experience to make something look so effortless.	2005-01-21

This beautiful coffee-table book weaves 129 images from the Apollo missions into a chronological super-mission, from liftoff to moon landing to splashdown. Only a few of these images are familiar, but a lot of them are not, and the book's large format brings out the details these images deserve. The pictures manage to show the moon as an otherworldly region of bright light and harsh shadows, a land so grey that the brief flashes of color -  the gold foil of the lunar lander or the red knob on the rover - stand out as if they were hand-colored. After paging through those sections, you can catch a brief understanding of the relief the astronauts felt at seeing the earth with its blues and greens and browns.<br /><br />Accompanying the images are a couple of essays that go into detail about the cameras and film used, and the difficulties the astronauts faced in getting the images, as well as how Light picked and chose among the thousands of images taken.<br /><br />Regarding the one-star review criticizing the selection of images, I can agree with the reviewer, but this book is still worth having. I was overcome with the large size of the photos and the world it reveals. It's as close as I'll ever come to walking the skin of the moon, and it reveals the fragility of the spacecraft, and the heroism - the true heroism - of men who risked their lives in them, on an almost visceral level.	2005-01-18

Hoffman would have found that ironic, since the loose ends of his life haven't been tied up for several books.<br /><br /> After run-ins with murderous students, professors and administrators at the State University of Michigan, Hoffman finds himself moving from the world of Ph.Ds to PIs as a way to escape the snakepit of academic politics with its internecine backstabbing and hypocrisies. A change of chairmanships and the prospect of introducing a Whiteness Studies program encourages Hoffman and his partner, Stefan, to escape over the Spring break at a Club Med resort in the Caribbean.<br /><br /> Alas, rest and relaxation turns out to be illusionary. Hoffman hoped to flee a potential client, a graduate student whose politically powerful in-laws may be behind some hate crimes at SUM. But tropical breezes, good food and pampered attention from the Club Med employees is spoiled when Nick finds that no matter how far you run, trouble will follow.<br /><br /> Raphael is an atypical mystery writer. His interests are wide-ranging, with a shelf of literary short stories, non-fiction (including a book on Edith Wharton) and even self-help books to his credit. His recent novel, \\"The German Money,\\" drew on his family's experiences during and after the Holocaust, and themes from his oeuvre show up in his mysteries as well.<br /><br /> \\"Tropic of Murder\\" is a series whose full flavor is released by starting with an earlier book that sets the latest plot threads in motion. I recommend No. 5's \\"Burning Down the House,\\" which launches the latest chain of events at SUM, but even better would be to start with \\"Let's Get Criminal,\\" when Hoffman was young, happy, in love, and innocent of the bloody fate in store, and you can take a full measure of pleasure in the loopy events at SUM in its tawdry glory.	2004-11-02

Mystery fans quickly took to Precious Ramotswe, her affection for Botswana's old ways and her friends who work on getting by, in a part of Africa nothing like what we see in the news.<br /><br />Less than six months after the publication of the sixth book in that series, \\"The Full Cupboard of Life,\\" Smith has launched a new series set in Edinburgh, Scotland, starring a woman who could be Precious' northern cousin.<br /><br />Isabel Dalhousie is a single woman in her 40s living off her small inheritance and what little money she makes from editing \\"The Review of Applied Ethics,\\" a philosophy journal. Her quiet, contented life consists of overseeing manuscripts, chatting with her housekeeper -- a morally upright woman \\"firmly planted in the world of douce Edinburgh, erected on rigid hierarchies and the deep convictions of Scottish Presbyterianism\\" -- visits with her small circle of friends and excursions into the cultural life of the city.<br /><br />In fact, it is at a classical concert that she plunges into a mystery: figuratively in her case, literally for the poor man who falls from the hall's highest balcony to his death.<br /><br />As a witness to his death, Isabel feels morally compelled to investigate. Decisions like these are never taken lightly. Several pages are devoted to deliberating, and philosophers such as Kant are invoked as part of the argument.<br /><br />But logic doesn't entirely rule Isabel Dalhousie's life. To our amusement and her regret, she can find herself going against her better nature, such as when a chance encounter with her niece's fiance on the street turns into an extensive surveillance that leads to an unpleasant surprise. Followed by more moral questions and deliberations over what to do with the information, of course.<br /><br />So while there are hints of danger and risk-taking, \\"The Sunday Philosophy Club\\" is a quiet mystery aimed in equal parts at the head and the heart. Isabel's journey into the life of the handsome man who died too soon is mirrored by her memory of a disastrous relationship with a man in college, as well as her attempts to straighten out the romantic life of her cousin.<br /><br />Perhaps it is significant that we're drawn to McCall's heroines.

Yet I rarely cracked a smile. The budding relationship between Joey and Mick is charming and romantic in its rough-hewn fashion, and Tool undergoes a surprising change.<br /><br /> But &quot;Skinny Dip &quot; is a lazy book. Thrillers work best when the heroine faces and overcomes insurmountable odds. But Joey's husband is unpleasant to be around, incompetent as a wildlife biologist and a horndog of Clintonian proportions. He's also an incompetent villain. Over the course of the book, he's insulted, attacked and abused by almost everyone. Despite his attempts at homicide, you can almost feel sorry for the fool.<br /><br /> However, my wife found &quot;Skinny Dip&quot; far more funnier than I did.

No matter what you think about the war in Iraq, &quot;The Iraq War&quot; will leave you uncomfortable about the strength of your beliefs.<br />John Keegan takes you through Iraq's long, bloody history, starting in ancient times and leading you through the founding of Iraq, its succession of governments (changed more often at gunpoint), the bloody rise of Saddam Hussein, the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s that drained the Iraqi treasury and led to the invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent Gulf War and the diplomatic maneuvering prior to the latest conflict, right up to the occupation of the country.<br />The actual text of the book is only 210 pages long, and Keegan writes so well that the pages fly by, even when it dives into the accounts of the invasions, when the necessary use of unit identifications and military jargon threatens to glaze the eyes of non-military readers.<br />The result is a history that challenges readers on either side of the conflict. Opponents of the war have to deal with the fact that that Saddam was a threat to peace in the Middle East and beyond. That he tried to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons cannot be denied, nor that he used chemical weapons against the people of his country. He also defied for 12 years U.N. resolutions that called for dismantling of his weapons programs, and, in the end, lacked the credibility to resolve the crisis even if he wanted to.<br />At the same time, Keegan points out that while Saddam kept his WMD programs barely alive during the '90s, they were crippled by sanctions far more than anyone -- including the U.N. and then-President Clinton -- realized. And the neoconservatives who believed that democracy can be transported into the Middle East have encountered enormous resistance from those who would lose power, such as the tribal sheiks and religious mullahs.<br />The only group to come out well in &quot;The Iraq War&quot; was the U.S. and British military, who fought bravely, improvised brilliantly at times and achieved their goal of toppling a dictatorial regime. That may offer some consolation to those whose world changed on Sept. 11.er, such as the tribal sheiks and religious mullahs.<br />The only group to come out well in &quot;The Iraq War&quot; was the U.S. and British military, who fought bravely, improvised brilliantly at times and achieved their goal of toppling a dictatorial regime.

Simpson trials, and all that's left is for the books to come out, letting us look back at those terrible tragedies that riveted the nation. Books like Ann Rule's &quot;The Vinyl-Coated Killer&quot; and Joe McGinnis' &quot;How, Now, Mistress Doll&quot; were excellent contributions to the genre. Now, &quot;The Dollhouse Murders&quot; adds a different perspective by telling the story of six deaths through the eyes of the investigators.<br />Author Thomas P. Mauriello has taken pains to disguise the names and locations of these crimes, to the point of changing the detective's name to &quot;the Detective.&quot; But no matter, these stories retain their dark edge of madness and tragedy, and the plethora of crime-scene photos adds a visceral kick in the gut to even the most jaded true-crime aficionado.<br />Doll-on-doll crime may occur on a smaller scale, but that doesn't make them any less horrific. There's the attempted robbery at the family store. Amid the cash register and grocery shelves, two men lay dead. We follow the detective as he works the scene, attempting to deduce the chain of events that led to the tragedy: a cracked pane in the pastry case; the pattern of money thrown from the till; the splatter of blood-like paint by the corpses. These are the red threads that must be knitted together to create a satisfying narrative.<br />Readers interested in learning step-by-step how a scene is &quot;processed&quot; will see that there is no one right method of working, and explains why some crimes don't get solved, how guilt cannot be proven. Clues are gathered using observation, intuition and an intimate knowledge of forensics, such as the way blood gathers where the body meets the floor, or what the size of the entry wound implies. Miss a clue, and the narrative will still be created, but it won't be accurate. Fail to look around at the right time, or fail to keep an open mind as to suspects, and you have another JonBenet Ramsey case on your hand.<br />Murder freezes a moment in time and the detective is its archivist. &quot;The Dollhouse Murders&quot; opens a window into the lives of dolls, seeing them at work and at home, in places we never see. By placing their deaths in the context of their lives, Mauriello is also issuing a plea for empathy and tolerance, in effect, putting a human face on the vinyl victims. But even more, these are taut, grim tales of violence and death, told with an eye for observation and an ear for detail that recall the best of Joseph Waumbaugh, Ed McBain and Elmore Leonard.

While writers such as Amanda Quick and Marion Chesney have long crossed the genre boundary by introducing crimes to solve, it's only in the last decade, since the late Kate Ross introduced the elegant crime-solving fop Julian Kestrel, that mysteries have found a home in the time of the madness of King George.<br /> There has also been a number of attempts at sequels and prequels to the books of Jane Austen, so it should come as no surprise that someone should attempt a mixture such as that found in &quot;Pride and Prescience,&quot; the debut of a series featuring Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, last seen getting married at the end of &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot;<br /> Carrie Bebris' novel continues their story, picking up literally after the Darcy's double wedding with Elizabeth's sister, Jane, and Charles Bingley. At the reception, Bingley's sister, Caroline, announces her engagement to Frederick Parrish, a wealthy landowner from Louisiana. Their whirlwind courtship and marriage prevents the Darcys from returning to his estate, Pemberly, and they stay in London for the wedding.<br /> Soon after the wedding, a series of frightening incidents casts a pall over the newlyweds. A horse bolts underneath Caroline. The Darcys' find her walking dazedly through the London streets by night. She apparently tries to kill herself by slitting her wrists. The family wonders if she is going mad and they agree to carry her off to Charles Bingley's country home, to rest and to be treated by Parrish's friend, Professor Julian Randolph. Readers of Gothic novels will discern the pattern this story is treading.<br /> &quot;Pride and Prescience&quot; is a story of nots and knots. The story is not bad, but there are no surprises and no interesting scenes to linger over until you reach the inevitable unmasking of the villain. Except for the conflict between Fitzwilliam's belief in rationality and Elizabeth's in intuition, the Darcys act more like a long-married couple rather than newlyweds needing to adjust to new and unique circumstances. The prose hews to the Austen style, its rough edges smoothed, without committing any serious solecisms, but it also lacks Austen's wit and observations, a point made clearer when you compare the quotations from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; that head each chapter.<br /> Bebris takes care not to offend Austen fans, but without taking risks, there are also no rewards. &quot;Pride and Prescience&quot; might appeal to Austen fans who want to spend a little more time in the company of her characters, but may be disappointed that more wasn't done with them.in rationality and Elizabeth's in intuition, the Darcys act more like a long-married couple rather than newlyweds needing to adjust to new and unique circumstances.

By age 30, after we've gotten our noses bloody a few times and wallowed in as much pleasure as our bodies and bank accounts can stand, we may have learned just enough to realize that either our parents knew more than we're willing to admit, or that they were truly hopeless and more to be pitied than to be censured. And that should be it. Time to grant them absolution and move on.<br /> Then, there are the cases like Paul's. His father bore the scars of being orphaned early in his life; his mother was a Holocaust survivor who came to America, married and left her past in Europe. He realizes that they were not the stereotypical Jewish families: \\"We were anything but lively and outspoken, not a perpetual carnival of conversation at all. Dad could be social and glib, but not with us, never with us. And serious subjects just weren't on our map.\\"<br /> With his sister and brother, Paul grew up in a home ruled by mysteries, subject to his mother's sometimes implacable silences and inexplicable anger. Small wonder he fled the urban jungle of New York City for the wilds of Michigan to escape his past as well. He had hoped he could abandon his Jewish heritage, his fianc&eacute;, Valerie, and bury himself in his dead-end job as a university librarian.<br /> But Paul is drawn back to New York City after his mother dies of a heart attack, and he learns that, of his three siblings, he alone would inherit \\"the German money,\\" the compensation his mother collected and never spent. The amount, nearly a million dollars, creates a split in the family, and Paul -- beset with a form of survivor's guilt -- becomes consumed with learning why he was chosen.<br /> But unlike Nick Hoffman, the college professor turned detective in Lev Raphael's witty and acerbic mystery series, Paul is no investigator.

Marcus Didius Falco is an informer for the emperor. He's walks the mean streets of Rome and like most detectives has seen it all, but he soldiers on because he has a wife he loves and children and relatives he tolerates and supports. He also has a ne'er-do-well father whose bathhouse was recently renovated, but the contractors left a smell under the newly laid mosaic floor that leads shortly to the use of pickaxes followed by the inevitable discovery.<br /> Then the story veers northward. From a brief investigation, largely off-stage, Falco suspects two notorious contractors of doing the deed and high-tailing it out of town, to join a massive building project on the coast of Britain. He never explains how he came to this conclusion. It's not only the sole building project in the entire empire, but by a marvelous coincidence, the emperor also wants Falco to go there, to look into a palace being built for the local king that's over budget and behind schedule.<br /> For added story interest, the rest of Falco's family gets dragged along, starting with his wife and their two infants. Since Falco's sister recently dumped the emperor's chief spy, who trashed her house, she comes along as well. Then there are the two cousins, both young and worthless men, who want to learn the informing business.<br /> After a brief, tedious trip through Gaul, they arrive at the building site, Falco meets the king, the architect (arrogant, as always) and the subcontractors, so we get page after page of discussions about sedimented facades, interior flow-throughs, sight-lines, triple-succession promenades, and soon the eyes begin to glaze over when this is followed by a discussion about how building projects were financed and how the bookkeeping was done, and soon you're wishing that you were that body in the bathhouse because then you'll miss all of this.<br /> It takes about 230 pages to set up the dominos which fall in the last third. That's when things start happening, mostly of the running around and beating up or avoiding getting beat up kind, but at least it gets us out of the Roman Empire edition of \\"Hometime.\\" But there's no real detection going on, and threats foreshadowed through most of the book fizzle out like a damp squibs. Everything turns out all right in the end, of course, and the soap opera situations are mildly diverting, but \\"Bathhouse\\" needed a stronger foundation to become a more compelling story.akes about 230 pages to set up the dominos which fall in the last third.

Carter, takes place before the book opens.<br />  It concerns Judge Oliver Garland, who in his long career on the bench shifted from a Thurgood Marshall liberal to a Clarence Thomas conservative, suffered when his teen-aged daughter was killed by a hit-and-run driver, and was rejected for a seat on the Supreme Court when he was caught lying about his friendship with the gangster Jack Ziegler.<br />  Carter's book opens with the Judge -- as he is known even by his children --found dead in his study from a heart attack. His son, law school professor Talcott Garland, learns at the funeral that the Judge had made \\"arrangements\\" of some kind before he died. Clues surface: a pawn from the Judge's chess set is delivered to him, and Talcott receives a message that \\"Angela's boyfriend\\" contains the key to the arrangements.<br />  Talcott is understandably mystified by all this. Unfortunately for him, other people are also interested in these arrange­ments, including Ziegler, and while he promises to protect the family until they are found, Talcott does not trust him, especially after he is stalked and attacked. Surviving long enough to learn what the Judge was up to provides the Macguffin behind this densely written 657-page thriller.<br />  As a professor of law at Yale and the author of several best-selling and well-received non-fiction books, Carter sets the story in his world, and he describes the world of the black upper-class with the nuanced eye of an anthropologist. It is a land separate but equal from what Talcott repeatedly calls \\"the paler nation.\\" It is a world where the children go to Jack and Jill, grow up to attend Howard University, enter politics, the media or finance, vacation on Martha's Vineyard and hold season tickets to Redskins games. The world of wealth, privilege and power is a staple of political thrillers, but seeing it through a black man's eyes give it an unusual freshness.<br />  Carter also infuses the story with themes drawn from his non-fiction books. Talcott is a Christian who is challenged to stay true to his faith; a teacher concerned with the proper education of his students and surviving the backstabbing found in academia; a father looking back at his relationship with the Judge and determined not to repeat it with his son; and a husband unable to control his suspicions about his wife's fidelity. These scenes, described by Carter's polished, measured sentences, make up the bulk of the book. The rest is thriller filler, complete with car chases, gunplay, late-night warnings phoned in and cat-and-mouse games with the villains and the police.<br />  Be warned: there are two Carters in this book. One is the social observer who sees a cocky student as \\"young, white, confident, foolish, skinny, sullen, multiply pierced, bejeweled, dressed in grunge, cornsilk hair in a ponytail, utterly the cynical conformist, although he thinks he is an iconoclast.\\" The other delivers clumsy if-I-had-but-known foreshadowings, and give the gangster lines like \\"I have asked my question. I have delivered my warning. I have done what I came to do.\\"<br />  \\"Emperor\\" goes out of its way to make it a tough book to like. The thriller elements don't thrill. Watching the slow-motion disintegration of Talcott's marriage provides more interest than a car chase. Worse, the characters are annoying. Talcott is a self-loathing and humorless drip whose introspective monologues give him an unearned gravity. His wife, a beautiful, ambitious attorney angling for a seat on the court of appeals, is a harridan and a viper. The rest of the family and the other characters range from the delusional to the unpleasant.<br />  Balanced against that is the prose, the observations, and the obvious intelligence behind it all. You want to root for Carter to succeed, and when he tells us in drips and drabs, the story of a judge drawn to an evil act and its soul-corroding effect on even the innocent and unknowing, you get the payoff of the novel that's swaddled withinthe story of a judge drawn to an evil act and its soul-corroding effect on even the innocent and unknowing, you get the payoff of the novel that's swaddled within	2002-09-22

Once a woman with a secret life -- British civil servant by day and glamorous romance novelist on the weekends -- she has since shed the bureaucracy, wedded a police officer, and opens &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot; by giving birth to her first child, at age 44, while her obstetrician is being unkindly murdered four doors down the hall.<br /> Spending a week in the hospital (possible under Britain's National Health Service plan) gives her time to investigate, and soon uncovers a passel of suspects, including an administrator who had been at loggerheads with the doctor over budget cuts, the wife of a wealthy businessman the doctor was having an affair with, and a nurse whom he had fired.<br /> The solution, however, seems marred by a motive and suspect tossed in from left field, and &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot; is wet-blanketed by King's worries over her responsibilities toward the baby, her relations with a husband who objects to her investigations, and the demands on once was her private and minutely controlled life. As an outrageously successful novelist who has, as a friend observed, a &quot;stunning house, perfect and loyal housekeeper, health, brains, love, Superintendent Worth to attend to your every whim and now a baby as well,&quot; it's hard to feel sympathetic toward a woman who wonders if she is losing her identity.

Convicted of a capital crime, he is given \\"time to depart\\" under law to escape execution. Return to the city would mean death.<br /> Shortly thereafter, the city is hit with a number of grandiose crimes: a market is emptied of valuable goods, the goldsellers are robbed in daylight, and, worst of all, men connected with Balbinus' trial are found tortured and killed. Falco finds himself in the center of these troubles in a number of ways. The goods he bought overseas on behalf of his father were among the stolen goods, and his best friend, Petronius Longus, was the officer who put away Balbinus. On behalf of the emperor, he must help his Petro determine who is seeking to replace Balbinus, as well as secretly determine who in the empire's version of a police force, may be on the take.<br /> Falco is also troubled by domestic matters when he finds that his lover, the daughter of a Senator who cannot marry him under law, is pregnant. Apart from the legal troubles (which, irritatingly, are neither resolved, nor did it turn out as threatening as Falco thought), he also needs to find a home, both for his expanding family and a mongrel dog determined to join them.<br /> One of the pleasures of visiting a historical world is in seeing just how different it is from our day. The world of ancient Rome did not have autos or phones, windows or locks on doors. A high-rise meant a five-story building. You didn't walk down certain streets, especially after night, or you had a retinue of club-wielding slaves that you hope will protect you when needed. Family links were not just optional, but vital, even when its members were undesirable (and Falco's extended family provide him with a great source of frustration, from his neer-do-well father to his lazy brothers-in-law). Graft, prostitution, murder, influence peddling and organized crime are not modern inventions by any means, but in a world measured on the human scale, these are take on an intimate, almost claustrophobic quality. Falco's world is smaller than ours, who can live in one city and drive to another to work, and \\"Time to Depart,\\" for all its grand scope, is also an intimate novel.<br /> It's also a longer novel than needed. When the crime wave breaks out and no suitable candidates for the role of instigator offered, it becomes apparent what's going on, and suspicions are confirmed after about 275 long pages. After that, events pick up speed, and the resolution of most of these threads are efficiently weaved in the book's remaining 125 pages, concluding with a wedding (not Falco's) which will either leave you shaking your head at the licentiousness of ancient Romans, or remind you of the receptions you attended.frustration, from his neer-do-well father to his lazy brothers-in-law).

US	52930352	R37CNK1G6F01N0	0316154059	817062475	City of Bones	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Welcome to Homicide, Existential Hero Division	Michael Connelly's \\"City of Bones\\" - his latest procedural about L.A. police detective Harry Bosch - is a book I would love to<br />recommend. Connelly's des­criptions of L.A. and police work are convincing, and like other books in this genre (po­lice procedural, existential hero division), there's the se­rious voice that tries to imply that there's something going on underneath the story. There's even something of a love story and a climax that suggests major changes in Bosch's life.<br />The story starts out with a bang, too, with the discovery of the bones of a long-dead child in a residential wooded lot. This attracts the cast of characters usually seen in the City of Angels: the publicity hungry coroner who brings along her camera crew, the police and press helicopters hanging overhead like sinister fireflies, the reporters using means fair and foul to gain ac­cess, the police department higher-ups putting pressure on Bosch to solve the case fast.<br />Bosch, too, is a fine study of the angst-ridden detective with a past. He's not too over­bearingly morose to inspire suggestions of Prozac and a long rest. He's good at what he does and dedicated to his work for a reason. As Bosch puts it, \\"It's the feeling that this won't just go by. That those bones came out of the ground for a reason. That they came out of the ground for me to find, and for me to do something about. And that's what holds me together and keeps me going.\\"<br />The case proceeds with the usual twists and turns, as Bosch digs back into the boy's past and uncovers the people who would like to see the case and the body re­main buried. Connelly's a for­mer police reporter, and he uses his eye for detail to build a convincing portrait of big-city police work's alternative culture, and how the relative­ly simple task of detecting can be bent and sometimes sabo­taged by the media, budgetary constraints and simple incom­petence.<br />Yet, \\"City of Bones\\" left me cold. While Connelly is good at recording the visible de­tails, the invisible ones trip him up. This is especially troublesome when they in­volve major plot points - and readers who wish to read the book anyway should skip this and the next paragraph. One officer tries to make herself a hero by attempting to kill a chase suspect and wound herself, only it goes wrong and she dies. Her death is heartfelt and sad, but the reason Bosch ferrets out - \\"she said she hoped to get a chance to be a hero one day. But I think there was some­thing else in all this. It was like she wanted the scar, the experience of it\\" - doesn't ring true. Ending his explanation with, \\"I don't know. I guess every­body's got secrets,\\" comes off as lame.<br />Another spoiler: The book ends with a major change in Bosch's life for which the motivation is equally as confusing. The resolution of the murder results in Bosch resigning the depart­ment. Again, the reader asks, why? Was he af­fected by the officer's death? It didn't seem that way. Is he tired of the office poli­tics? Given the evils that he's seen on the job, I can't imag­ine that would be the case. Yet, nothing makes sense.<br />\\"City of Bones\\" is all effect and no cause. It's well-writ­ten, tightly paced and a quick read, but it's best not to think about it too long after you close the covers.t recording the visible de­tails, the invisible ones trip him up.

He believed early on that nothing is worth doing if it can't be done in public. He tells of watching the Apollo 11 astronauts walking on the moon and how he wants to be just like them, not for the adventure or thrill of exploration, but because of the attention they drew. When he was selected to join NASA, he didn't just phone his wife and say, \\"Honey, I'm in.\\" No, he waited until just before their plane took off for their vacation and had one of the pilots make the announcement.<br />If you can set Linenger's ego aside for a moment -- and you know it would take a bulldozer and a couple sticks of gelignite to do it -- you'll find that he's written an excellent, richly-detailed account of his experiences in Russia and in space.<br />The U.S.-Russian joint effort came very close to being one of NASA's biggest failures. Originally designed to last five years, the station had been up for 11 and was literally falling apart. Warning alarms went off regularly. Hoses split, releasing antifreeze that the astronauts breathed. Devices broke down. There were numerous power failures. Garbage and broken equipment built up because there wasn't enough room in the spacecraft to get rid of it. Russian mission controllers lied to the astronauts about the dangers they were facing, berated them for failures that were not their fault, and treated the American astronauts like idiot step-children.<br />Then there were the life-threatening accidents. During Linenger's time aboard, a fire broke out in the equipment supplying oxygen. Despite the efforts of six men, it burned uncontrollably for over 15 minutes before putting itself out. Not only was no investigation held to determine its cause, but the Russians minimized the damage and blamed the astronauts. This censor-and-blame attitude wouldn't have been countenanced in NASA, but for the sake of U.S.-Russian relations, they went along with it. If the fire hadn't burned itself out, there would have been six dead men in space, and NASA Administrator Dan Goldin would have been held responsible for putting American astronauts into danger. It's clear from Linenger's account that only the heroic actions of the astronauts and cosmonauts kept the station running for as long as it did.<br />The book goes into great detail about the nuts-and-bolts of life aboard Mir: the sounds, the smells, the daily schedule and relentless work needed to keep her flying. Linenger is a generous host, willing to reveal everything. One of the more fascinating sections described his earth-observation duties. Driven by his desire to become \\"a world-class geographer,\\" he goes into detail about how he accomplished his goal. I'm fascinated about how some people can do so much while others -- myself included -- do so little. Time management, for me, is limited to finding a watch I can wear longer than two weeks. Watching Linenger at work is worth more than any motivational speaker.<br />\\"Off the Planet\\" is an admirable book. Linenger is an excellent storyteller, and writes clear prose. He describes the scientific and technical aspects in terms understandable to the general reader. But, unwittingly perhaps, he also provides a glimpse inside Jerry M. Linenger, M.D., Ph.D., and shows us the seed inside his egotism. His galaxy-sized self-regard can be annoying on the page, but from it came his ability to accomplish much. It drives him to be the best at whatever he's doing, no matter what. And as a result, for five month, it really was Jerry's world, and we were just along for the ride. After that harrowing voyage of the near-damned, he's earned his bragging rights.itself out.

Despite his success as an animator, he was untested in running a theme park, and he was unable to get his company's board of directors to invest in what back then seemed an outlandish idea (&quot;dreams offer too little collateral&quot; Walt ruefully confessed at the time). &quot;WDI&quot; reprints the initial maps of the park, and with each repetition, we see Disney's dreams growing, from the 11-acre Riverside Drive property originally envisioned to the 50-acre park it eventually became.<br />To those who only see the finished product on film or in the stores, the amount of detail and effort that goes into creating the Disney universe is astonishing. Every element must be drawn or modeled, and the Disney creative process demands that each design go through several iterations, sometimes through substantial changes. The result is a gallery of ideas and images, worked in painting styles both impressionistic and realistic. Elaborate models are created, such as the gym-floor sized Epcot layout or the six-foot tall &quot;Tree of Life&quot; that towers 13 stories over Disney's Animal Kingdom in Orlando. Not surprisingly, the Imagineers have grasped computer modeling with the same enthusiasm they have put in everything else they do.<br />Some of the best pictures describe projects that never were. A ski resort in Northern California. An entertainment center in Burbank. A &quot;House of Cheese&quot; design for a proposed food pavilion at Epcot. But these are not complete wastes of time and money. Projects that were interrupted for one reason may be revived and continued for another. For Disneyland Paris, artist Tim Delaney reworked Sleeping Beauty's castle into a three-towered art nouveau structure modeled on Mont Saint-Michel that looks as stunning and startling as the Eiffel Tower must have looked to Parisians a century ago. Even a Ferris wheel designed in 1954 was revived 40 years later for Disneyland Paris.<br />&quot;WDI&quot; gives the impression of a corporate culture that demands creativity, and pays for it by encouraging exploration and curiosity. The book is exuberant and unabashed eye candy for Disney fans, a treasure trove of artistic styles and an inspiring guide that describes what it takes to take an idea and see it through to the finished product.t nouveau structure modeled on Mont Saint-Michel that looks as stunning and startling as the Eiffel Tower must have looked to Parisians a century ago.

Nor is this some soft New Ageism about spirits inhabiting the celestial plane.<br />He's alive down on a plot of land outside of Orlando, Florida, a boom city that was a dumpy little crossroad when Walt began buying what became a 30,000-acre spread there is the late 1960s.<br />Walt's gone, but his vision and energy lives on, and once you start dipping into \\"Since the World Began,\\" you'll see that the scope of his vision is nothing short of awesome.<br />There are many faces of Disney, the producer of family-friendly and highly profitable movies, the creator of family-friendly theme parks, but also a visionary who thought that, as one associate put it, \\"bad information was responsible for all the evil in the world.\\" Who tried to change people's attitudes within the confines of an amusement park, the man whose idealism spawned the Epcot center, and under Michael Eisner, the Disney Institute, where education and learning are on a par with entertainment.<br />What the book won't tell you -- this is published by Hyperion, Disney's publishing arm, and written by Jeff Kurtti, a longtime Disney employee -- is just what hell Walt went through to realize his vision. You won't hear of Disney's fundamentalist upbringing, his retreat into fantasy to escape a brutal father and life in poverty, his endless hard work to make animated movies, his multiple nervous breakdowns. His brother Roy is idealized as the business brain behind Walt's success, but you won't hear that Roy constantly opposed Disney's ideas as a waste of money. When Kurtti writes that Disney founded the design firm Walt Disney Imagineering in 1952 \\"because he realized that he wouldn't be able to create Disneyland within the boundaries of the studio system,\\" he doesn't mention that it was also because Roy and the Disney board refused to advance Walt the money to design Disneyland, fearing that it would be a failure.<br />There was plenty of reason for Roy to be worried, too. Disney's ideas constantly threw the company perilously close to bankruptcy, generally on the order of every 18 months, until Disney's deal with ABC in 1955 made him very wealthy and put the company on a firm financial footing. Walt Disney was an idealist and a visionary, and if it wasn't for his tenacity, the company would not be the worldwide giant it is today.<br />Even while ignoring those shadings, there is still plenty of story left to make \\"Since the World Began\\" an awe-inspiring overview of Walt Disney World. It's probably the single largest and most complex construction project this side of the space shuttle.

The problem is finding it. This collection of essays uses words, pictures, artwork and imaginative reconstructions to describe the ancient world ruled by gods and which built monuments that have lasted millennia.<br />The book's 15 chapters opens all aspects of the Nile kingdom's world. In addition to the expected sections on the pyramids, its hieroglyphs and Pharaohs, &quot;Ancient Egypt&quot; also delves into religious beliefs, political campaigns, the role of women, the development of towns and trade and the daily rituals of its people.<br />Wrapped around the text are superlative photographs, shorter articles about equally fascinating subjects (a profile of Ramesses the Great in the section on Pharaohs, for example, or on the &quot;letters&quot; to the dead, written on simple pottery bowls and deposited in the tomb or coffin), plenty of colorful reproductions of Egyptian art so vivid that the course of individual brush-strokes could be seen, and commissioned drawings giving theories of how pyramids were built, and what the Temple of Karnak must have looked like at its height.<br />But what really shines are the little touches. A closeup of an Egyptian artist, his scruffy hair and scraggy beard making him look like a New York bohemian, using an odd-shaped tool on a wooden beam; the vivid face of a long-dead woman painted on a board and included with her mummy wrappings, gazing at the reader with the poise of nobility; a piece of prose passed among the scribes that mocks all other trades (&quot;the potter is under the soil, although he stands among the living / He grubs in the mud more than a pig in order to bake his pots&quot;); a drawing of a fortress built to impress the Nubians in southern Egypt, looking for all the world, with its towers and crenellations like something out of medieval Europe.<br />So much about ancient Egypt seems so familiar, but, really, we were just watching &quot;The Ten Commandments,&quot; or remembering the villain King Tut from the old Batman TV show.&quot;Ancient Egypt&quot; shows us what we were missing.towers and crenellations like something out of medieval Europe.<br />So much about ancient Egypt seems so familiar, but, really, we were just watching &quot;The Ten Commandments,&quot; or remembering the villain King Tut from the old Batman TV show.&quot;Ancient Egypt&quot; shows us what we were missing.	2002-03-04

Wetzon, the former dancer partnered with Smith in their growing headhunting firm, acts as her own Watson as she investigates the death of one of the characters associated with The Groaning Board, the gourmet store partway through its 15 minutes of fame. Its principals are fighting over an initial public offering that can stand to make them millions, and the sharks are circling over this potential gold mine.<br />Meyers is a writer with the cheek to install a solitary Fabio in the background of a restaurant scene and razz at his declining celebrity, as well as to insert a quotation from one of the book's characters into the fronts piece. She's talented enough to create Xenia Smith, a barracuda whose cheerful duplicity and unabashed greed manages to retain the affection of both Wetzon and the reader.<br />She also does for New York City in detective fiction what Woody Allen does in film: showing us the glamor and the attractions of the city that never sleeps. To Meyers, New York is a nice place to visit and you would want to live there, and it is be a measure of the city's place in fiction that this attitude comes across as fresh, almost revolutionary.	2002-03-03

What's the first book in Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series? Who are writing books featuring bed &amp; breakfasts?<br />As those who love reading mystery series know, it's difficult to keep track of the hundreds of writers past and present who have contributed to the mystery genre, which is why reading sleuths will love &quot;Detecting Women,&quot; a guidebook to the distaff side of mysteries.<br />This handsome, large paper bound book lists more than 600 series and 3,400 books written by women. Each entry contains a biographical introduction with the title and year of each book, and notes if the book has been nominated for any awards. Editor Wiletta Heising has done an exceptional job of breaking down the information, providing extensive lists that break down series by year, occupation, geographic location and even pseudonym.<br />The brief biographies are gold mines of fascinating information that invites lengthy browsing. Here is where you can learn that Grafton's fictional P.I. Kinsey Millhone will celebrate her 40th birthday once &quot;`Z' is for Zero&quot; appears in 2009 (when Grafton will be 69); that Agatha Christie wrote 35 novels featuring Hercule Poirot, and 12 about Jane Marple; and that the largely forgotten Anne Katherine Green is considered the &quot;mother of the detective story,&quot; and was a best-selling author nine years before Arthur Conan Doyle put pen to paper.<br /><br />Purple Moon also publishes a pocket guide to help mystery fans track of their favorite series, and comes with a notepad useful for noting suspects, clues, and books desired. &quot;Detecting Women&quot; provides a welcome overview of the rapidly expanding mystery field, and can reintroduce readers to now-forgotten and obscure writers. It is nothing less than required, fascinating reading for mystery fans.	2002-03-03

Sayers did more in her life than just create the aristocratic detective Lord Peter Wimsey. In addition to writing the Wimsey novels and short stories, she was one of the first female graduates of Oxford, a translator of Dante, a poet and a Christian apologist whose reputation at the time rivaled that of C.S. Lewis.<br />Her longtime friend, Barbara Reynolds, draws on her memories of the woman as well as her voluminous correspondence and has written a lively account of Sayers' life.<br />Those who admire the Wimsey novels will find their enjoyment heightened after reading this book. As I found in researching the \\"Annotating Dorothy L. Sayers\\"..., Sayers flooded her work with literary, historical and social references that represented the best of her education as well as her interests in the murderous and the macabre: Shakespeare, John Donne, Greek mythology, contemporary English music-hall acts, Gilbert & Sullivan, notorious 19th-century murders and snippets of classical Greek and Latin. To write \\"The Nine Tailors,\\" which featured a church and its bell-ringers, Sayers spent two years studying campanology, and had to endure, she wrote, \\"incalculable hours spent in writing out sheets and sheets of changes, until I could do any method accurately in my head. Also, I had to visualize, from the pages of instructions to ringers, both what it looked like and what it felt like to handle a bell and to acquire rope-sight.'\\" After the novel was published, she thought she had been caught out on only three small technical errors, but did well enough to be asked to serve as vice-president of the Campanological Society of Great Britain.<br />But the books also contain much of Sayers herself. Obviously, Sayers' alter ego was expressed in the character of Harriet Vane, the mystery writer she put on trial for murder in \\"Strong Poison,\\" who was romanced by Peter in \\"Gaudy Night,\\" and who married him in \\"Busman's Honeymoon.\\" But Sayers also drew on her life experiences and her interests. \\"Gaudy Night\\" reflected her experiences at Oxford, her desire to live the scholarly life and the importance of intellectual achievement, while the parsonage she vividly recreated in \\"The Nine Tailors\\" was drawn from her childhood memories, and the gentle churchly Rev. Thomas Venables was modeled on her parson father.<br />Christianity played a great role in Sayers' life from the start, and the success of the Wimsey novels enabled her to shelve the detective and turn to writing plays and books that expounded the doctrine of the Church of England in laymen's terms. In this, she was enormously successful, and even sparked a ruckus when one of her plays featured the disciples talking in modern slang, predating the uproar over \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" by three decades.<br />Reynolds also tells the story of  the illegitimate child Sayers bore. While it would be easy to condemn her for turning the boy over to a cousin to raise, Reynolds also made clear that Sayers did it to protect her parents, who she thought would be terribly hurt by her misjudgment. Considering that she visited and paid for his upkeep and education, and told him the whole story when he was an adult, it seems to have been the best of all possible choices.<br />The pleasure of meeting Miss Sayers can only be increased by looking into her letters, which have been published in several volumes. From the first, Sayers seems to have been bright, precocious and determined to make her own way, and it's a pleasure to see in Reynolds' biography that she did so splendidly.r interests. \\"Gaudy Night\\" reflected her experiences at Oxford, her desire to live the scholarly life and the importance of intellectual achievement, while the parsonage she vividly recreated in \\"The Nine Tailors\\" was drawn from her childhood memories, and the gentle churchly Rev.

Classic cases from Agatha Christie and Anthony Boucher are laid alongside current popular favorites Sara Paretsky and Bill Pronzini. While Ellery Queen's \\"The Gamblers' Club\\" and \\" represents the old-fashioned who-done-it, Ruth Rendell's \\"The Man Who Was the God of Love\\" and Stanley Ellin's \\"Fool's Mate\\" are longer, psychologically driven tales involving shrewish wives and wormy husbands.<br />There are even stories with a sting in their tales, like H.R.F. Keating's \\"Scrabble Babble Dabble,\\" about a wife whose husband's mania for the game drives her to murder. The story would have fit right into the old \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\" television show. David Kaufman's \\"Mr. Hancock's Last Game\\" hints at a deal with, well, if not the devil, then someone in the same zip code, that would make it appropriate for \\"Weird Tales.\\"<br />The collection's only major weakness is in the lack of explanatory introductions. Short-story collections can be a great introduction to an author's novels, and while John Steinbeck (whose \\"The Crapshooter\\" contains no mystery element at all but is included anyway) and Christie need no introduction, some of the lesser-known authors would have benefited from a few well-chosen words. But overall, \\"Win, Lose or Die\\" is a top-notch collection of puzzles and plot devices, an ideal break between chess moves, while the deck is being shuffled, or at halftime.	2002-02-25

Holland is haunted, literally and figuratively, by L.Q. Navarro, his partner in the rangers, who he accidentally shot and killed while battling drug smugglers in Mexico. This could understandably put a strain on most friendships, but Navarro doesn't mind being dead. It's pretty restful to sit around and swap lies without having to bother with mundane facts like earning a living. His role in the book is less avenging spirit and more amiable sidekick.<br />Rounding out the setup is a son Holland's never acknowledged, a fine boy named Lucas Smothers whose mother died when he was an infant. He's being raised by a harsh and hostile stepfather who's sharecropping on Holland's land.<br />Unfortunately for Lucas, he was found passed out near the body of his raped and murdered girlfriend, and Holland works to dig out the truth. Arranged against Holland and Lucas are an array of corrupt, evil and just plain psychopathic characters: the son of the town's most powerful family who may or may not be involved in the murder, the corrupt sheriff and his deputies and Garland T. Moon, a wandering psychopath dying of cancer, who came back to Deaf Smith on a mission of his own.<br />Weaved among the contemporary story is the tale of Holland's great-grandfather, a drunken gunfighter who has since taken the pledge, and his true love, known mostly as the Rose of Cimarron. Everyone once in awhile, Holland takes down the family journal and reads about his ancestor's battle to win his true love's heart and remain a peaceable man despite his conflict with the Dalton-Doolin gang, who have taken root in the caves near his farm and are sending property skidding down by robbing trains, shooting innocent women, letting their hogs run free and shooting wild horses for meat.<br />It's to Burke's credit that keeps these plates spinning; one is never confused over who's talking to whom and what's happening next. The problem with \\"Cimarron Rose\\" lies in the ponderous, carved-in-stone writing, and the utter incomprehensibility of most of the characters' actions.<br />Burke has a fine talent for creating memorable images, but he lets his pen wander farther than he intends, leading to some very ludicrous sentences.  While Holland recalls his father, a welder who died when the natural-gas pipeline he was in exploded, he reflects, \\"my mother said his vision had become so bad that clarity of sight came to him only when he struck the stringer-bead rod against the pipe's metal and saw again the flame that was a pure to him as the cathedral's bells were to the deaf bellringer Quasimodo.\\"<br />That's mom, all right, always quoting Victor Hugo.<br />This is a manly man's book, full of testosterone... and vinegar, where it seems like everyone is savaging everyone else. If Holland is not getting beaten up, his horse is getting slashed, his house ransacked, the new sheriff's deputy who may or may not be fed is getting ambushed, his son's getting drugged, stripped and dumped at the country club, or any one of a dozen acts of mayhem. Put it to music and you've got a country song.<br />This over-the-top violence will either convince you that you're reading Deep Literature, or make you break out laughing. You can guess which side I landed on. By the time Garland Moon bursts into a house and torments the owner by twisting his nose, I'm thinking Three Stooges.

Edgar Hoover, A Novel	Books	3	25	25	N	N	One-Note 'Love Song'	You can tell that the title of Kinky Friedman's ninth novel, &quot;The Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover,&quot; hints at an educated author who is also a humorist with a flair for the politically incorrect. The title is a take-off of T.S. Eliot's poem &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,&quot; and the story was written by the man who fronted a band called the Texas Jewboys and penned country songs like &quot;Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed&quot; and &quot;They Ain't Making Jews Like Jesus Anymore&quot; (which is not as offensive a song as you'd think.) Obviously, Kinky Friedman is a man who is not afraid to offend. You have been warned.<br />Friedman's novels are the most unconventional in detective fiction. His hero is a carbon copy of himself who becomes an amateur detective after saving a woman's life during a robbery attempt at an ATM. He lives with his cat in a badly heated warehouse loft on 199B Vandam St., New York City, and surrounds himself with an unconventional set of friends like journalist Michael McGovern, who has both a drink and a chicken dish named for him, Ratso, who sometimes wears a coonskin cap complete with head and Rambam, a mercenary &quot;wanted in states whose names begin with an I.&quot;<br />They're an eccentric group of friends, so when McGovern says he's seeing little green men and receives threatening phone calls from an old friend named Leaning Jesus, it's understandable why Friedman wants to avoid him, especially since he has been hired by a beautiful woman to find her missing husband. The case becomes troublesome after Friedman is caught in a narcotics raid in D.C. and a flaming limo in Chicago. His sleuthing uncovers a clue that McGovern's troubles might be connected to the missing husband.<br />This is not the best book in the series. Friedman seems to be going through the motions here. While first-time readers will be either enchanted or repelled by Friedman's stream-of-consciousness prose and wicked, frequently scatological wit, regular readers will sense a flagging of energy. Friedman's plots are usually simple frameworks on which he hangs his jokes, but here it becomes annoying that the story doesn't begin moving until halfway through the book. Too little is too much this time; this is one love song that strikes a sour note.<br />If you're still interesting in sampling Kinky's work, I would suggest his Hank Williams Jr. tribute &quot;A Case of Lone Star,&quot; or his more recent &quot;Roadkill,&quot; featuring Willie Nelson.requently scatological wit, regular readers will sense a flagging of energy.

Take for instance there's the story of the wealthy man's son who attempts to emulate Julius Caesar's arrogant behavior when he was captured by pirates. Gordianus is hired to deliver the ransom. It is easy to tell who instigated the kidnaping and why, but the story still compels us follow the thread to the end.<br />It helps that Gordianus is a compelling character, a man who makes a living investigating the dark side of the Roman Republic, when Julius Caesar was still a politician aspiring to become a divine dictator. He is aided sometimes by Bethesda, his Egyptian slave who sometimes acts more like his wife. Even his mute adopted son, Eco, plays a crucial role in the story of the actor murdered backstage during a performance.<br />The Roman era has been well-served by writers such as Saylor and Lindsay Davis. For those interested in the era who haven't made Gordianus' acquaintance, this book offers an ideal introduction.	2002-02-24

But \\"From Storebought to Homemade\\" sometimes promises one thing and delivers another. It offers \\"fabulous food in minutes,\\" but contains recipes that take an hour to cook. It promises cooking with convenience foods, but there are recipes that contain none.<br />What's most bizarre are Jenkins' wide-ranging assumptions about what we-all -- yes, 30 years in the South has affected my speech patterns -- are doing in our kitchens. \\"Somewhere along the way,\\" she writes, \\"we seem to have forgotten that it's okay to use store-bought products to cook up delicious meals.\\" Which, I guess, explains all those untouched frozen dinners icing over in the freezer cases.<br />Somewhere, Jenkins must have decided that we grocery shop by putting on a blindfold. \\"Everyone is so anxious to cook everything from scratch that we've turned out a generation of frustrated cooks.\\" Reading this, I realized nothing less than a Messianic vision: a whole generation of men and women, unhappily chopping cilantro, basting London broil and rolling out our own pasta in abject misery. \\"Cooks of the world unite!\\" Jenkins shouts. \\"You have nothing to lose but your Calphalon chains!\\"<br />Her solution? Convenience foods. With the zeal of a convert, she offers nothing less than a three-page list of what you can find on the shelves if you'd only open your eyes: create-a-meals, ready-to-serve sauces, packets of seasonings. Why, she writes, there's even Welch's grape juice, available \\"preblended.\\" She leads us over to the produce aisle to show us salad fixings, pre-washed, pre-chopped and already bagged. She suggests that we buy our mashed potatoes already cooked, and raid the salad bar for chopped celery. While her ideas are sound, it surely must have occurred to participants in life's rat race to buy that slab of frozen lasagna, a bag of chopped lettuce and a box of ice cream to make a meal.<br />As for the recipes, there are 200 of them, most of them printed one to a page, with plenty of room for spot illustrations and bits of trivia and suggestions. Most of them seem to be culled from the standard cookbooks, the Junior League productions, or from Emyl's friends.

The untenured professor and star of Lev Raphael's four mystery novels faces a bleak future from his unwanted connection with several murders. He's concerned about the rise of hate crimes against gays on campus. Even his sexuality has come under assault by his unexpected attraction to Juno Dromgoole, the voluptuous Canadian professor who's a force of nature in spandax. Not that he's against such connections, but his long-time male lover might object.<br />Worse, the State University of Michigan is under considerable turmoil. A new administrator has pushed the faculty to open revolt with her high-handed ways. If that built the bonfire, the presence of a Christmas \\"Diversity Tree\\" and the possibility of a Whiteness Studies program is the equivalent of dumping gasoline and tossing on the flaming torch. And Juno's campaign to become chairman of Nick's department is being undermined with threats. Nick tries to negotiate these land mines, but his search for the source of these attacks compels him to reach a possibly life-changing conclusion.<br />As a former professor, Lev Raphael has plenty of material to etch his acidic portrayals. There are few good people. The administrators and faculty are deadly ambitious, hilariously inept or simply clueless. Back-biting and rumor-mongering are traditional ways to gain power or revenge. Meetings tend to degenerate into accusations and chaos. In this context, violence seems like just another way to get ahead; cannibalism the logical conclusion of a bloody-minded faculty meeting.<br />\\"Burning Down the House\\" marks a new direction among the amateur detective subset of the mystery genre. It's less a mystery novel than the culmination of threads woven in Raphael's previous books, beginning with \\"Let's Get Criminal.\\" Nick's confrontations with violence and death has been changing him, from a buoyant teacher to a more edgier version, flirting with the possibility of violence. This can make \\"Burning\\" an unsettling book at times; Nick is almost manic in his reaction to Juno and the crimes he's witnessed. The lead protagonist honestly being affected by violence is rarely seen in this part of the mystery field; most either start out that way, or never seem to mind constantly being surrounded by bodies. Following Nick's journey into the dark side of human nature alone makes the next book in the series worth watching for.unsettling book at times; Nick is almost manic in his reaction to Juno and the crimes he's witnessed.

Either his pen was racing across the page, or he was racing across the world, gathering the raw material of experience for his stories, es­says, letters, novels, invest­ments and inventions. He was a writing machine, turning out so much copy that we haven't yet found the bottom to this gold mine.<br />  Part of Twain's greatness is that he was a man of enormous talent and en­ergy who was in the right places at the right times. It was the perfect combination that made him a uniquely American artist. Talent without energy would not have given him the ability to write so much. Ener­gy without talent would not have made him, as Russel Banks' words, a wise guy who was wise. American letters is full of humorists who are now footnotes. In Twain's time, there is P.V. Nasby, and Josh Billings, Bret Harte and Arte­mus Ward. What makes Twain so different?<br />  First, Twain saw himself as more than a humorist. He was a moralist. He was perfect­ly capable of writing funny without a point, whether it be about a trick played with a jumping frog, or the stories about Tom Sawyer. But he also used Huck Finn to rage against slavery. He berated Commo­dore Vanderbilt for not using his millions to help the poor (he later hob­nobbed with the rich, one of those contradictions that en­riches his character). Later in life, embittered by the death of his children, he abandoned hu­mor to rail against imperial­ism, lynching and even God.<br />  Written by Burns' collabora­tors Dayton Duncan and Geof­frey C. Ward, \\"Mark Twain\\" is crammed full of stories that show us the man behind the penname. Twain boiled with mirth, resentment, anger and passion, both on and off the page. When a button was found missing from one of his freshly-laundered shirts, he cursed and threw the whole stack out of the window of his home. On the lecture circuit, he gloried in leaving his audiences helpless with laughter.<br />But his sorrow was equally powerful. When he lost the love of his life, his wife, Livy, he wrote, &quot;There is no God and no universe; . . . there is only empty space, and in it a lost and homeless and wandering and companionless and indestructible Thought. And . . . I am that thought.&quot;<br />  But as Twain helped define the nation with his writings, the nation also defined him. He planted him­self deep into the rich soil of the South, the West and the East, and drew upon all those sources for his work. He grew up in Hannibal, Mis­souri, on the stories told by whites and blacks. His became a riverboat pilot, intimately aware of the power and beauty of the Mississippi River. He avoided fighting in the Civil War - for which he was never chastised, partly because he was so willing to make fun of himself over it - and worked as a newspaperman and failed silver miner in Nevada and San Francisco. Seeking success as a writer, he went East where the publishers were, and settled in Hartford, Conn. As his fame grew and he traveled world­wide, he brought home more tales to tell, but they all had a source in common: humanity in all its rich glories and taw­dry foibles.<br />  \\"Mark Twain\\" briskly charts Twain's incredible life, and in­cludes essays by writers like Banks and Jocelyn Chadwick and an interview with Twain impersonator Hal Holbrook that are entertaining and illu­minating. Interwoven in the text are Twain's own words, so many that he should have re­ceived co-author credit.<br />  But the book's crowning glory are in its photo­graphs, many of them never published. This is the strongest rea­son any Twain fan should look at the book. It's an incredible selection. Here he is at the breakfast table during his round-the-world lecture tour he took at age 60, looking like he just got out of bed (which he did). There, he's on the stage, &quot;lending tone&quot; to a lecture by Booker T. Washington.<br />  And one of the saddest ap­proaches art. It was taken in 1900, and after several deaths (a son in infancy, one daughter four years before), and the family is down to his daughters Jean, Clara and his wife, Livy. Jean was away, so the picture only shows Twain, Livy and Clara. They're there, but they're not part of the picture; they look in different directions as if they can't bear to be there. He's looking at the camera, in soft focus, unable to stand still for a moment. As if their grief had a physical presence, the glass photo is cracked. It is a portrait of a family slowly colliding with tragedy.<br />  By the end of his life, Twain had had enough. He was ready to go out with the return of Ha­ley's Comet in 1910. At his fu­neral, his unique stature in lit­erature was recognized by his good friend, Joe Twitchell, who called him, \\"the Lincoln of our literature.\\"<br />  \\"I am not an American, I am the American,\\" Twain said, and \\"Mark Twain\\" shows how he became our most American writer.r />   And one of the saddest ap­proaches art.

After floundering amid the incoming tide of Christmas commercialism at the grocery store, Luther conceives the idea of avoiding the holidays by going on a 10-day cruise, beginning on Christmas Day.<br />Astute readers may wonder why they didn't simply avoid the holidays by leaving 10 days before Christmas.  But Grisham here is playing on our expectations. He knows, as does the reader, that the Christmas redemption story demands that the Kranks undergo a revival of the Christmas spirit. Having them take off 10 days before would make that impossible. That would be logical. That would make sense. But human beings are not logical, Grisham is saying. We're animals, creatures of flesh and desire, and values such anything as friendship, love and altruism are false. Ayn Rand would have considered Nora and Luther Krank as heroes.<br />So Luther arranges the cruise and buys time at a tanning salon. He convinces his wife to go cold turkey on Christmas. No cards, no gifts, no carols, no tree, no lights, no plastic Frosty statue on the roof. What follows is a series of encounters with neighbors and co-workers, and a parade of symbolically charged figures representing Capitalism enslaved into serving religion. With each encounter, through the phrase, &quot;So, I hear you're not (insert name of Christmas-related activity) this year,&quot; the Kranks are pressured into renouncing their Randian beliefs.<br />The mental torture must be immense. When asked, &quot;So, Nora, no Christmas Eve bash this year?&quot; Nora thinks, &quot;you crude little snot.&quot; With an ability to peer behind such simple facades, Grisham sees something more sinister behind such innocent comments.<br />Meanwhile, Luther is importuned by Boy Scouts selling overpriced Christmas trees, the police selling calendars, and firefighters selling fruitcakes, all to serve various causes. To each, Luther &quot;forgets&quot; his promise to his wife and rejects their overtures. Instead, he promises each that he'll give them money later. We can bet that Luther will also &quot;forget&quot; these promises.<br />But Nora is not happy. Despite being the wife of a proto-Randian hero, Nora is still and woman and thus doomed to succumb to societal pressures. When their daughter calls the night before Christmas from Miami to say she'll be there for Christmas with her fianc&eacute;, Nora gives in. She will reaffirm middle-class values and rebuild the facade that they spent the book trying to tear down. They will have Christmas with all the trappings, and she turns on Luther like an avenging angel. She had endured his stoicism and his belief systems long enough. She has been critical of Luther throughout the book, but this tirade outdoes them all, and climaxes with an echo of the sexual confusion that permeates the whole book:<br />&quot;This was your stupid idea. Well today, you're an idiot. We're having the party, Mr. Beach Bum, and we're putting up a tree, with lights and decorations, and you're going to get your little brown butt up on the roof and do Frosty.&quot;<br />Cowed by his wife's anger, Luther rushes about and gathers the fixings for the party, but not before noticing one thing:<br />&quot;Don't Peruvians have dark skin?&quot; he asked.<br />Nora froze for a second. They stared ateach other, then both looked away.<br />&quot;I guess it doesn't matter now,&quot; she said.<br />&quot;She's not really getting married, is she?&quot; Luther said, in disbelief.<br />But they must put their racism aside. They must get the party together, and what follows is a series of comic scenes reminiscent of the Chevy Chase &quot;National Lampoon&quot; movies: Luther buys a tree from the Scouts, who, being of high moral character, shafts him on the price. He borrows a decorated tree from a neighbor and gets the police called on him. Luther tries to &quot;do Frosty&quot; and slides off the roof, and is saved from destruction only by a stray rope around his ankle. Then, when he confesses the real reason to his neighbors, they agree to help, solely because they love Blair, &quot;who was like a daughter to them all.&quot;<br />And that's not all from the joy-master. The Kranks' fears about a dark-skinned Peruvian is abated. It turns out that he is a doctor capable of speaking English who was educated in London and whiter than Luther's tan. Grisham had set up the tanning-bed sequence with a double purpose, and he sets off the charge that results in an explosion of hearty laughter from the reader.<br />After giving away the trip to a neighbor he doesn't like whose wife has breast cancer and will die, Luther feels blessed. Despite being boring and selfish and a racist and having no friends whatsoever, Luther gets pulled out of a jam, not because of who he is, but because he's related to someone people love. Luther has come to realize that he can be a true Randian hero, knowing that he won't have to suffer the consequences because of his powerful position within the company, and because his neighbors are in the thrall of his daughter. He has no regrets for what he's done nor regrets for his beliefs. Although temporarily defeated, Luther reflects optimistically on the future, thus setting the stage for &quot;Skipping Christmas 2,&quot; in which Grisham will expound further on the merits of Objectivism. But with its brevity, its wit, and its deep undercurrents, &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is a brilliant tour de force that will continue to inspire debate and deep furrowed thinking.ch other, then both looked away.<br />&quot;I guess it doesn't matter now,&quot; she said.<br />&quot;She's not really getting married, is she?&quot; Luther said, in disbelief.<br />But they must put their racism aside.

The cardboard bindings, generous type and colorful wrapping gives the feeling that what you hold in your hand is a work of lasting value. It's saying this is not just a paperback story whose pages age into brittleness as fast as you turn them.<br />Archer Mayor's series about Vermont detective Joe Gunther well deserve the hardcover treatment. His seventh book, &quot;The Ragman's Memory&quot; is a richly crafted tale that begins with the discovery of a hank of human hair in a bird's nest, and grows into a web of interrelated murders driven by greed, insanity and pride.<br />It's also a book whose plot should not be summarized further. Even reading the jacket copy would spoil the fun of watching Gunther -- competent and bland but surrounded by a great supporting cast -- start with a small girl's wonderment at the hank of human flesh she found, and follow that thread as it grows and turns tangled and convoluted. It's a mandlebrot of a story. The closer Gunther and the rest of the Brattleboro police force look, the more details appear, the list of suspects grow, and the implications and dangers of what they find increase.<br />Mayor tells his tale with carefully chosen words that economically reveals its details without padding. His writing is focused and sometimes intimate at unexpected moments, whether spotting a detective with an unusual method of passing the time at stakeouts, or creeping into the mind of a World War II veteran unable to leave the Battle of the Bulge.<br />Acting as the amphitheater for this morality play is Vermont, a state of rugged, sometimes heartbreaking beauty, mashed against the reality of industrial towns that have outlived their usefulness but which survive on sheer inertia. It's a landscape as compelling as Chandler's Los Angeles or Hillerman's New Mexico, and Mayor's skill renders the Green Mountain State with sympathy and beauty.ty.	2001-10-24

But in 1805, he ruled Society, and he was capable of starting a fashion or exiling a social climber from the invitations of the ton.<br /><br /> Rosemary Stevens takes her experience writing four romances set in this period to craft a mystery that's hews strictly to the ruts of the genre. Everything else about the novel delights: the details of Brummell's life, the fastidioius attention paid to his dress and the design around his life, his sudden inspirations and manuverings through the pitfalls of his position.<br /> Historical novels like these offer a pleasant immersion into a society and its beliefs, and while one mustn't go too far in praising this book -- there's still plenty of room on the shelf for a Regency novel with the breadth and penetration that, say, &quot;The Alienist&quot; performed on 1880s New York City -- &quot;Death on a Silver Tray&quot; surpasses expectations.<br /> Where it falls apart is in the mystery. In short, there is none so much as to be worth noticing, and the reader turns the pages and enjoys the sights and waits for Beau to stumble on the next obvious clue. There are even the usual folderal scenes that most debut mystery novelists have been warned to avoid. A Bow Street Runner (police that is) warns Beau not to Get Involved In The Case. Beau receives threats in the mail. There's even a Siamese cat who could be an ancestor of Lillian Jackson Braun's Koko and Yum-Yum. It may be unseemly to offer such objections to a book with such lightweight intentions, but the late Kate Ross' books about Julian Kestrel show just how good a book set in this era can be.	2001-09-12

But they act as cats, not as characters on a par with their owners, as seen in Rita Mae Brown's series, nor do they offer hints as to who done it, as in Lillian Jackson Braun.<br />No, like the cats, Babson wants to play with the English literary scene, so her authors are beset by the neighborhood's new arrivals: the venomous critic Plantagenet Sutton, a college professor who collects writers like some collect butterflies, and a husband-and-wife duo seeking to record in camera and prose a year in the life of a charming English village. Not only that, but the characters in Lucinda and Macho's books seem to be acting up as well, resenting their creators' plans to replace them with other series.<br />Babson is a writer with a long track record, and she capably serves up in &quot;Canapes for the Kitties&quot; a charming, breezy cozy laced with some tart darts thrown at some tempting targets.	2001-09-12

That's the question that pops to mind after finishing this pseudo roman a clef.<br />Its formula is simple: take the last half-century of American lit, New York division only, and wrap it around the theme of an artist's struggle between the demands of art and the temptations of commerce.<br />&quot;Lit Life&quot; would make a great party game, along the lines of the one played in the book, in which the first line of a novel is quoted and the players must come up with the book and author. Is Bret Easton Ellis or Jay McInery closer to Kyle Clayton, the brat pack hotshot who's eight years past the blazing success of his debut novel, now infested with writer's block and an adoration of alcohol, on the outs with his friends, his co-writers and his agent? Then there are his potential mentors: the elderly &quot;writer's writer&quot; -- meaning critical favorite but no sales -- Richard Whitehurst, whose last book, in the works for ten years, bombed (let's see, reclusive yet respected and depressive, that's William Gaddis, and the decade-long book that bombed could be &quot;The Tunnel,&quot; by William Gass); and Arthur Trebelaine, the popular writer with the Hemingwayesque reputation (Herman Wouk? Mario Puzo? How about Irwin Shaw? Discuss.)<br />When Kyle's latest escapade made him persona non grata in Manhatten, he accepts Richard's invitation to spend the summer with him at his house on Long Island. There, he finds himself rejuvinated enough to resume writing, but he's also plunged into Whitehurst's crippled family, consisting of his estranged and attractive younger wife, the drug-addicted wild daughter who blames daddy for everything bad that's happened to her (Elizabeth Wurzel! Just kidding.). Kyle also finds himself becoming the rope in a tug-of-war between Richard and Arthur, whose close friendship is unraveling rapidly under the stress of jealousy, envy, paranoia and fear.<br />Don't expect to find sympathetic characters; the three writers are sometimes charming, but all monsters in different ways, and their self-absorption makes me want to hit them with a clue stick. But if you're interested in the tribulations and paranoias of the writing life, &quot;Lit Life&quot; offers a stress-free, sometimes amusing voyage, sort of like the &quot;Pirates of the Carribbean&quot; ride at Disneyland: see the old-fashioned agent dunking pickles into his coffee at a deli meeting with a writer; see the rapacioius publisher threatening to sue to get Kyle's advance back; see the combination of back-biting and brown-nosing that goes on at a PEN party. Some of the story lines don't make sense. Would &quot;The Paris Review&quot; really favor a profile of Trebelaine over Whitehurst? And what did Chevy Chase do to Wenzel that earned him an extended cameo as a buffoon during a charity softball game on the Hamptons that co-starred Martha Stuart, Billy Joel and coach John Grisham?<br />Wenzel displays a wonderful skill at crafting satirical barbs and effortless prose, which writers know takes a lot of work to achieve. &quot;Lit Life&quot; is a slightly pre-chewed chunk of summer fiction that can be read and digested before the weekend's over.writers are sometimes charming, but all monsters in different ways, and their self-absorption makes me want to hit them with a clue stick.

Frog legs, snails, truffles, poultry, and, of course, its wine. Sheer heaven!<br />Peter Mayle accepted the challenge and here's the perfect book for curling up on the porch alongside a glass of cool refreshment. &quot;French Lessons&quot; charts a year in Mayle's life as he travels across France, describing with a combination of droll wit and wine-soaked facts (many times, he couldn't read his notes the day after some festival) how a country blessed with not only a variety of climates and cuisines, but also a people willing to spend large amounts of money on their enjoyment thereof.<br />I am a longtime fan of Mayle's writing, back when he was writing about pastis and other subjects for &quot;European Travel &amp; Life&quot; magazine, but I hope not an uncritical one. I was disappointed in his account of his return to France in &quot;Encore Provence,&quot; and &quot;Hotel Pastis&quot; did not engage me at all.  Sometimes, I wonder if, with skills learned in the advertising trade, where he was an executive, he doesn't succeed in giving the French a gloss it doesn't otherwise deserve. Certainly, when discussing chickens from Bresse, the only poultry to have its own label (called appellation contrôl&eacute;e), he touches only in passing, how most chickens we eat are raised (if we may call it that) in horrible conditions. Not for nothing is it called factory farming.<br />But &quot;French Lessons&quot; went down like a lightly garlic-flavored escargot. This is a book which celebrates eating and drinking well, and is a balm to the soul as well as incentive for the appetite. Needless to say, it should only be taken in short dollops, after a good meal.<br />Not everything has to do with cooking. There's the Le Club 55, a restaurant in Saint-Tropez where the Beautiful and mostly undressed people meet to eat and be seen, where an expert on plastic surgery was able to tell which surgeon worked on which lift (&quot;Cosmetic surgery has its Diors and Chanels, and when looking at a suspiciously taut and chiseled jawline or an artfully hoisted bust, the informed eye can identify who did what.&quot;)<br />Then there's the Marathon du M&eacute;doc, where, amid the serious runners, jog several thousand more in fancy dress amid the châteux of Bordeaux, where wine is offered at the refreshment stations, and the winner earns his weight in wine. Rounding out the book is celebration of frog's legs on the last Sunday in April in Vittel, where 30,000 people will eat five tons of the stuff. If you want to know what they taste like, Peter will inform you down to the last bite of the marrow.<br />And if you wish to attend these fetes, addresses and other notes are listed at the back of the book.<br />&quot;French Lessons&quot; represents a return to form for Mayle. So long as he is willing to go out and hunt up new stories to tell, he'll remain an entertaining and informative writer.eet to eat and be seen, where an expert on plastic surgery was able to tell which surgeon worked on which lift (&quot;Cosmetic surgery has its Diors and Chanels, and when looking at a suspiciously taut and chiseled jawline or an artfully hoisted bust, the informed eye can identify who did what.&quot;)<br />Then there's the Marathon du Médoc, where, amid the serious runners, jog several thousand more in fancy dress amid the châteux of Bordeaux, where wine is offered at the refreshment stations, and the winner earns his weight in wine.

It's &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; crossed with Albert Camus as directed by John Woo. In crime fiction, Teren is riding shotgun with James Ellroy in a `66 jet-black Fastback at night somewhere beyond Barstow, these two lost boys driving on a river of concrete, like Huck and Jim, toward their collective hearts of darkness. And if you think that's a little out there, you have some idea of what Teren's offering.<br />An improbable triangle is at the heart of this noir thriller. In 1987, Dee Story takes her 14-year-old daughter Shay into the desert night to entrap and kill a police officer, Victor Sully, who was going to testify in a drug case. The attempted hit goes very, very wrong, leaving Sully badly wounded and a drug-dealing suspect. He withers under the media spotlight, is cut loose from the department and his life goes down the drain.<br />Flash-forward a decade, and Sully is called back to L.A. by an agoraphobic columnist who writes under the by-line of Landshark. It turns out the hit was part of a larger conspiracy involving a family of developers and a school being built on a toxic dump site. The thieves are falling out over money. Exposure is threatened, plots are laid, and Sully returns to find the truth and extract his revenge.<br />But all that is a backdrop to the human struggles that take up most of the book, the loves and hates and past sins that bind us sometimes unwillingly to each other. Shay tries to make a life for herself away from her manipulating mother. Dee makes a plausible and scary villain, at turns protective and hurtful to her daughter, but when hopped up on speed a loose cannon equally alternating between a determination to hold it all together, or blow everything apart.<br />And lying underneath the layer of angst and blood is a boy's adventure story. Behind Landshark's four-story house in the mountains overlooking L.A. is an elaborate information-gathering network. His clubhouse of a mansion includes a shooting gallery, an arsenal that would make Charleston Heston's trigger finger itch and enough computers to run the Space Shuttle. Landshark also has his crew of Baker Street irregulars, including a bipolar cousin escaped from &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next&quot; and the obligatory computer hacker.<br />To say that Boston Teran's prose is over the top is like saying the Atlantic Ocean's a little damp. The pace never slackens, except when Teren's fondness for finding striking substitutes for verbs runs unchecked at the story's climax. With some very good reasons, the boys and girls in Teren's world express their views of themselves, life, death, redemption and existence so despairing as to make Ingmar Bergman look like Pee-Wee Herman.  The earnest end-of-the-world symphony of bullets and blood-letting with either make you roll your eyes, or it will grab you hard by the short nerves and won't let you go.

It couldn't be boredom, that only leads us to the television, and nothing great can come from that.  But p. and d. sends us on our way toward religion, art, music and a new and improved toilet paper. Sometimes, it leads to our destruction.<br />&quot;Sputnik Sweetheart&quot; is set in contemporary Japan, but apart from a few cultural references, it could be read a century from now and still sound current (a fact which threw the Kirkus Reviews writer who thought it was set in 1957 from the Kerouac and Sputnik references at the beginning of the book. The anonynmous reviewer must have missed the Mac Powerbook being used at the end of the novel. Ah, well, the book is only 210 pages long, and Kirkus doesn't pay very much for its opinions).<br />All great love stories have a triangle, to keep the happy or unhappy ending from happening too soon, and in this case it's Sumire, the dedicated unpublished novelist, Miu, the older woman and object of her desire, and the narrator, a teacher and close friend of Sumire, who loves her deeply. Like the Russian satellite, they go round and round and round, sometimes crossing paths and sometimes trying to connect. Murakami describes and explores their relationship in a quiet, restrained fashion, cooly post-modern, but clear in its intent.<br />With a book this short, telling more would be to tell all. The facts are few, but richly embroidered with plenty of meditations that could be read in a number of ways. The life of the book exists not just on the page -- and it's a pleasure to read Murakami's work on that basis alone -- but what goes on in your head as you track the orbits and these lonely satellites.	2001-07-07

Now married and the parents of a young boy, they are caught up in the activities of rising Buddist cult with much official support, but also with much to hide.<br />When an arson fire reveals three bodies in a house and a young woman found beaten and unconscious nearby, Sano enlists his wife's help in questioning her. But pressures to solve the case quickly force a split between the couple, as Reiko gradually sympathizes with the orphan who had to choose between entering the temple or becoming a prostitute to support herself, and Sano's need to solve the case quickly.<br />Complicating the case is Sano's cultural upbringing, which taught him that the man is always right and that a woman's shouldn't get involved in anything as nasty as a murder investigation. Much of &quot;Black Lotus&quot; is caught up in the struggle between the strong-willed couple.<br />Rowland invests much of the series into opening the world of medieval Japan, with its unusual customs and deadly palace intrigues. Her previous books are filled with the feeling of falling into a foreign and dangerous culture that readers of &quot;Shogun&quot; will find familiar. But in &quot;Black Lotus,&quot; the conflict between Sano and the temple -- which seems inspired by the Aum Shinrikyo sect responsible for the gas attack on the Tokyo subway a few years ago -- permits a much narrower scope. With the villains in place early and seemingly little in the way of a mystery to plumb, &quot;Black Lotus&quot; rings the changes with its characters and situations in an energetic but predictable fashion. The earlier books, particularly &quot;The Concubine's Tattoo,&quot; which I reviewed on Amazon, are better introductions to the series.	2001-07-07

It's been five years since we've heard from Donald Westlake's creation, but while he's been away, Dortmunder hasn't lost any of his zip, whether evading police inside a Sam's Club-like megastore to planning the burglary of a mansion guarded with the latest high-tech security measures.<br />It wouldn't be giving too much of the book away to say that &quot;Bad News&quot; could also be subtitled, &quot;Or, the Last of the Pottaknobbees.&quot; That is the scam Dortmunder stumbles into while switching bodies during a contract job in a Long Island cemetery. Soon, he and his confederates -- the massive Tiny and the smooth car thief Andy Kelp -- are freezing in the woods of upstate New York, helping to pass off a Las Vegas casino dealer as the last of her Native American tribe, and therefore the one-third owner of a reservation casino worth millions. It's not an easy task, dodging stake-outs, the police, the casino's owners and the trio's reluctant partners, but &quot;Bad News&quot; hums along as Dortmunder and crew maneuver -- on eggshells sometimes -- among a gallery of rogues, imbeciles and everyday misfits. <br />Westlake has been around long enough that it may be difficult to realize just how truly inventive and consistent he is. He's delivered the goods in works ranging from comic novels (&quot;Baby Would I Lie?&quot;) to his hard-edged Richard Stark series, to caper novels that tread a fine line in between the extremes (&quot;Kahawa,&quot; set in Idi Amin's Uganda), and the corporate satire,  &quot;The Axe.&quot; &quot;Bad News&quot; is another welcome addition to Westlake's collection of must-read and must-re-read books.	2001-07-07

Human lives are not as responsive. We have to do it ourselves. When we are confronted with losses and absences, we have to choose how to replace those lost connections and fill those empty hours. Unfortunately, many of those choices -- drink, drugs, serial relationships, television, the Internet -- can't fill the longing within our hearts, to soften the rough edges on our shredded souls.<br /><br />The narrator in \\"Big Fish\\" is confronted with an absent father who came home only to die. Unlike the implication of his last name, Edward Bloom could only grow when he was traveling, making money. \\"The very idea of coming home at the same time every single day made him just a little nauseated. Regardless of how much he loved his wife, his son, he could only stand so much love.\\"<br /><br />While it may work for him, it leaves his son trying to fill the gaps. He makes up stories about his father: where he came from, how he grew up, what he did. They were not just any stories, but tales of the fantastic. Edward Bloom was born on the day Alabama's worst drought in 40 years broke. He could converse with the animals. He could run so fast \\"he could arrive in a place before setting out to get there.\\" He subdued a wild dog, rescued a river nymph, bought a small town and saved his son's life twice.<br /><br />But most of all, Edward Bloom was a teller of jokes, an alcoholic consumer of puns and punch lines. Even in the four chapter scattered among the 25 vignettes -- the book is only 180 pages long -- Bloom tells jokes to his son (\\"Doctor, doctor, I've only got 59 seconds to live.\\" \\"I'll be there in a minute.\\") who, in turn, grows increasingly exasperated. Annoyed, but at least he has someone to be annoyed at. Better than nothing.<br /><br />\\"Big Fish\\" is another of those pocket-sized books that have grown increasingly popular since the success of Alan Lightman's \\"Einstein's Dreams\\" years ago. Like that book, it's almost impossible to describe except by what it's not. It's not a novel so much as, in effect, a tone poem, a performance piece on paper, a dreamlike tribute to a distant but loved man and the transforming power of story telling and humor.It's not a novel so much as, in effect, a tone poem, a performance piece on paper, a dreamlike tribute to a distant but loved man and the transforming power of story telling and humor.	2000-09-18

The playwright is broke after her last  play flopped, and her new play must run at least three days for her to make  any money on it.  To make matters worse, the Earl of Rochester managed to  cast his mistress in the lead, despite her obvious lack of talent,  as part  of a bet that Aphra can turn her into London's best actress.<br />When a man  who befriended her many years ago is found dead, she arranges for his  funeral to repay an old debt. But her innocent act has drawn the attention  of some mysterious figures, including the head of the king's secret  service.<br />&quot;Invitation to a Funeral&quot; is full of Restoration  figures, noble and common: King Charles II, his competing mistresses such  as the actress Nell Gwyn and the Duchess of Portsmouth (nicknamed  &quot;Squintabella&quot; by Nell), and the carousing Earl of Rochester.  Those who know the era will recognize some of the incidents Brown uses for  her own devices.<br />Aphra Behn stands out among the general run of amateur  detectives for her refusal to act like one. She is not Jessica Fletcher  teleported to the 17th century, just a single working girl trying to keep  body and soul together while working in a profession which most people of  the time considered one step removed from prostitution. What with  shepherding her play to the stage, dealing with Rochester's mistress,  running deeper into debt and avoiding her debtors (as well as an ex-lover  attempting to win her back), she doesn't have time to play detective. How  she manages to get into serious trouble anyway makes &quot;Invitation to a  Funeral&quot; a pleasurable jaunt back to another historical era.	2000-09-18

It's part upscale cookbook, offering recipes for Hot Thai Curried  Chicken with Coconut Milk and Avocados, Ring of the Sea Schrimp with Fish  Market Sauce and Cherry-Chambord Butter; part basic cookbook that discusses  making stock, omlets, vinaigrettes, biscuits, pie crusts and sauces; part  trouble-shooting guide that explains which flours are appropriate for  biscuits, pancakes and bread, how to beat egg whites so that they rise  properly, and how to calculate the right amount of sugar for the perfect  fruit ice; and sometimes part memoir. It's a schitzophrentic book.<br />There's no doubt that Shirley Corriher knows cooking like Dr. Stephen  Hawking knows the cosmos. She came to the kitchen by a circuitous route, as  a research biochemist at Vanderbilt University Medical School in Nashville.  When her husband opened a boarding school in Atlanta, she was responsible  for feeding 140 boys three meals a day. A winning entry in a grits recipe  contest in the mid-1970s brought her cooking lessons with Nathalie Dupree,  who was impressed with her pupil's questions and knowledge.<br />Since then,  the 63-year-old Corriher has built a career as a food consultant, working  with restaurant chefs and food industry scientists, leading workshops, and  writing articles. &quot;Cookwise&quot; is her first book, a decade in the  making and, judging by the long list of people she thanks in the beginning,  a number of editors, including top food editor Maria Guarnaschelli, who  completed the makeover of the &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot; recently.<br />So  there's a lot of prime information tucked here and there among the 230-plus  recipes. The problem is digging it all out. It took a number of readings to  conclude that the editors of &quot;Cookwise&quot; thought the seven major  chapters were too large to be digested, so they broke them up with recipes,  smaller articles and cooking tips. The mix was sweetened with a hash of  type fonts chosen more to create a visually appealing style than for  clarity's sake. Since it's publication, I've consulted it a number of  times, and found that &quot;Cookwise&quot; makes an acceptible and  interesting supplement to &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot; (both volumes) and  Julia Child's &quot;Way to Cook,&quot; without replacing them.x was sweetened with a hash of  type fonts chosen more to create a visually appealing style than for  clarity's sake.

With large measures of wit, she  traces her stations of the crass: her parents setting weight goals with a  contract at age 11, being rejected or ignored by men, even, at a party  where overweight women can meet men, criticized for not being fat enough.  What could have been a series of tedious lectures on touchy-feeley New Agey  topic is instead a personal story about the development of an actress as  well as  a woman learning to live within her skin.	2000-09-13

Lee, George Washington might be considered the marble man  of his time, a revolutionary whose passion doesn't burn as bright on the  pages of history as, say, Thomas Paine, or as clear as Thomas Jefferson. He  may be admired and revered, but not necessarily loved, certainly not in the  way as old Marse Lee.<br />Whether Washington the man can be reclaimed from  Washington the statue is a task left up to biographers and fiction writers,  because after thumbing through this collection of his writings, it is with  some certainty that the man from Mount Vernon can't do it himself.<br />Once  gets the impression that Washington was a man who believed in duty, to  himself as an eighteenth-century man of means, and to his country, whether  it be England (for whom he participated on several expeditions against the  French in Pennsylvania), or his newly created United States. The man who,  in 1755, volunteered to join the British commander in chief, General Edward  Braddock, on what became a disasterous expedition into western  Pennsylvania, became by 1775 the man who would write to his wife announcing  his appointment to head the rebel army, that, &quot;I have used every  endeavour in my power to avoid it [command].&quot;<br />Even his ascention  to the presidency was performed in very reluctant steps. In a letter to  Henry Knox, he wrote, &quot;I can assure you . . . that my movements to the  chair of Government will be accompanied with feelings not unlike those of a  culprit who is going to the place of his execution.&quot;<br />So why serve?  &quot;It was utterly out of my power to refuse this appointment without  exposing my Character to such censures as would have reflected dishonour  upon myself, and given pain to my friends,&quot; he wrote Martha  Washington.<br />Perhaps an early clue to his character can be found in the  first entry, a collection of 100 maxims he composed when he was 15, rules  for living which range from the practical (&quot;Put not your meat to your  Mouth with your Knife in your hand neither Spit forth the Stones of any  fruit Pye upon a Dish nor Cast anything under the table&quot;), to the  inspirational (&quot;Let your Recreations be Manfull not Sinfull&quot;),  and even a bit of the poetic (&quot;Labour to keep alive in your Breast  that Little Spark of Celestial fire Called Conscience&quot;).<br /> Sober,  practical, firm-minded, George Washington was not a man to inspire devotion  through force of personality, only through a far-sighted competence which  does not make for glorious history, but to those who cherish the ideals and  promise of America, one can be thankful that he was in the right place at  the right time.Put not your meat to your  Mouth with your Knife in your hand neither Spit forth the Stones of any  fruit Pye upon a Dish nor Cast anything under the table&quot;), to the  inspirational (&quot;Let your Recreations be Manfull not Sinfull&quot;),  and even a bit of the poetic (&quot;Labour to keep alive in your Breast  that Little Spark of Celestial fire Called Conscience&quot;). <br /> Sober,  practical, firm-minded, George Washington was not a man to inspire devotion  through force of personality, only through a far-sighted competence which  does not make for glorious history, but to those who cherish the ideals and  promise of America, one can be thankful that he was in the right place at  the right time.	2000-09-13

Following in the steps of Donald Rumbelow's &quot;The Complete Jack the  Ripper,&quot; Philip Sugden decided to go back to the original source  material, plus the packet of material taken from the London police that was  mailed back to them in 1987, and recount the history of the case. This he  does well, going over the material, the press reports and other writers'  theories with a skeptical eye and a fearless passion for the truth. He  finds, not surprisingly, that the press reports are extremely inaccurate,  that most of the memoirs written by police officials decades after the fact  were not to be believed, and that many Ripperologists were either  criminally negligent or, at best, unable to see deeply into the evidence  and render accurate judgments.<br /> There is some new material here,  however, particularly Sugden's researches into the three suspects Sir  Melville Macnaghten thought were prime Ripper candidates. At the time of  the killings, Macnaghten was assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan  Police in charge of CID, but that rank did not spare him from Sugden's  dissection of his claims that the Ripper was M.J. Druitt, Kosminski, or  Michael Ostrog. By checking out Macnaghten's other claims in his  statements, it becomes plain that the old boy had no evidence to back up  his charges.<br /> Sugden traces other claims and counterclaims like this,  and while he was unable to unmask the Ripper, he does offer a candidate  more suitable that Macnaghten's three, and with the help of criminal  profiling, suggests a line of investigation that may throw more light on  this century-old mystery. If you're unable to plow through the 800-page  Ripper book coming up in December, this is the one book to get!	2000-09-13

Now comes &quot;Murderous Schemes,&quot; a cleverly designed book by Donald  E. Westlake, a writer of mostly comic caper mysteries who is himself  something of an institution.<br />What is ingenious about &quot;Murderous  Schemes&quot; is that Westlake takes eight conventions of the mystery genre  -- locked room, capers, armchair detectives and so on -- and picks four  good stories to illustrate each, from an oldie but goodie to a hope-to-be  classic. The result is an evenness of tone which the eight sections bob up  and down like a steady sea wave. The book's organization also allows the  reader to dive in according to his or her interests: fans of over-the-top  mysteries can head directly to that section, while those who want to read  all the latest stuff know exactly where to go.<br />What they will find in  almost all cases are top-quality stories that are not solely limited to  mystery writers. Alongside such standbys as Raymond Chandler, Rex Stout,  Stanley Ellin and Lawrence Block are some effective choices from writers  whose nefarious doings are rarely noted: Isak Dinesen, Roald Dahl, Jack  London and Damon Runyon.<br />Weaknesses? Hardly any, although it's  surprising to find Chandler's &quot;I'll Be Waiting.&quot; It's a fine,  taut tale, but the fellow's waiting also in Oxford's other two anthologies.  Ellery Queen's &quot;The Adventure of Abraham Lincoln's Clue&quot; can also  be found in &quot;American Detective.&quot; And -- this is a personal  quibble, mind you -- but I can do with a lot less of Edward D.

While spending the better part of two decades in Great Britain, he wrote  travel memoirs (&quot;Notes From A Small Island,&quot; &quot;The Lost  Continent&quot;) and books on the English language (&quot;The Mother  Tongue,&quot; &quot;Made in America&quot;). After he removed his family to  Hanover, N.H., he wrote &quot;A Walk in the Wood,&quot; his hilarious and  sometimes sobering account of his attempts to hike the Appalachian Trail.<br />As if that wasn't enough, he was also writing a weekly column for a  British newspaper, and he has gathered 70 of these into &quot;I'm A  Stranger Here Myself.&quot;<br />As a humor columnist, Bryson shares many  similarities with Dave Barry. He has the ability to see the odd and  unusual, things that we may not see or simply take for granted. He finds  the toll-free number on the box of dental floss and wonders why anyone  would call it (&quot;OK, I got the floss. Now what?&quot;), remembers the  road trips his family made in an America before the chain gangs like  Holiday Inn and Cracker Barrel got to it, (&quot;Visit World Famous Atomic  Rock -- It Really Glows!&quot;), or muses on the suitability of &quot;Live  Free or Die,&quot; the New Hampshire state motto on his license plate  (&quot;Frankly, I would prefer something a little more equivocal and less  terminal -- &quot;Live Free or Pout&quot; perhaps.&quot;)<br />But Bryson has  something that Barry doesn't: attitude. The ability to see is a two-edged  sword. People may not always appreciate what you have to say about them.  Going for a walk on a beautiful day, he notices how many drivers have their  windows rolled up, how we want to shop in enclosed malls, work in  temperature-controlled offices, to the absurdity of dressing up in exercise  clothes and driving to the mall in order to walk there. His visit to the  Opryland Hotel, with its &quot;flawless, aseptic, self-contained world,  with a perfect unvarying climate and an absence of messy birds, annoying  insects, irksome and unpredictable weather, or indeed any kind of  reality,&quot;  reminded him of '50s art in Popular Science describing a  space colony on Venus: &quot;Or at least what it would be like if all the  space colonists were overweight middle-aged people in Nike sneakers and  baseball caps who spent their lives walking around eating handheld  food.&quot;<br />Bryson also attacks the American shopping experience, our  simultaneous obsession with dieting and eating fatty foods, the vacuousness  of cable television and our overabundance of choice (&quot;there is too  much of every single thing that one could possibly want or need except  time, money, good plumbers, and people who say thank you when you hold open  a door for them.&quot; Bryson can be as cranky as Paul Thoreoux, but you'll  take it with a smile.nd Hotel, with its &quot;flawless, aseptic, self-contained world,  with a perfect unvarying climate and an absence of messy birds, annoying  insects, irksome and unpredictable weather, or indeed any kind of  reality,&quot;  reminded him of '50s art in Popular Science describing a  space colony on Venus: &quot;Or at least what it would be like if all the  space colonists were overweight middle-aged people in Nike sneakers and  baseball caps who spent their lives walking around eating handheld  food.&quot; <br />Bryson also attacks the American shopping experience, our  simultaneous obsession with dieting and eating fatty foods, the vacuousness  of cable television and our overabundance of choice (&quot;there is too  much of every single thing that one could possibly want or need except  time, money, good plumbers, and people who say thank you when you hold open  a door for them.&quot; Bryson can be as cranky as Paul Thoreoux, but you'll  take it with a smile.	2000-09-03
US	52930352	R3W0AB4GICQIRV	1883011906	94817990	Reporting Vietnam: American Journalism 1959-1975 (Library of America)	Books	5	13	14	N	N	A valuable compilation	Reading this collection of Vietnam-era reportage from The Library of America is a stark reminder of the lasting power of the written word. Has  it really been nearly a quarter-century since the black and white images of  the helicopters taking off from the roof of the American Embassy faded from  our television screens? Grenada, Panama, Iraq -- three wars and God knows  how many humanitarian efforts (Somalia, Yugoslavia, did I miss any?)<br />Yet, the power of memory is such that it doesn't take much to bring it  all back. Dipping into these compilations of writings about Vietnam -- the  original reportage and memoirs in the Library of America volumes and the  best of everything else in &quot;The Vietnam Reader&quot; -- shards of  long-forgotten memories were struck just by reading the names of towns and  villages. Khe Sahn, Haiphong: The words sound so completely alien, as if  they had been coined by H.P. Lovecraft. They trigger memories of tracing  the S-curve of the countries on maps in the newspapers, seeing the  photographs in Life magazine -- for me, the 1960s will always be remembered  as a series of black and white freeze-frames from the magazines, with color  reserved only for the more silly stories found in the back of the book --  and hearing them recited on TV in the stentorian tones of Walter  Cronkitethe  who would recite the weekly casualty figures, printedon screen  before the national flags, like baseball scores,  while the family ate our  meat loaf and mashed potatoes and waited for Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom  to come on at 7.<br />Time has passed and in this media-drenched age, so much  history has been created, screened and absorbed over the past  quarter-century. Vietnam and Cambodia became a backwater in the American  consciousness, flaring up from time to time in response to specific, finite  events such as the debate over Agent Orange, the construction of the  Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the screening of &quot;Platoon&quot; and  &quot;The Killing Fields,&quot; and the debate over draft evasion by Bill  Clinton, Dan Quayle, Phil Gramm and Newt Gingrich.<br />For those of us who  were not there, who can view the war almost dispassionately, it is this  lack of intervening history that makes these books so powerful and painful  to read. This is a chronicle of a nation marching deeper and deeper into a  war that the journalists there saw as early as 1965 -- about 150 pages into  two volumes that total more than 1,600 pages -- could not be won the way it  was being run. Historians will probably argue eternally if it could have  been won at all. The repressive and corrupt South Vietnamese government  could not win enough &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of the people to defeat  the Viet Cong, and an invasion of North Vietnam could have triggered a  Korean War-style invasion from China. It took nearly a decade for the  United States to find the way out of that bloody tunnel and another two  decades before full diplomatic relations were reestablished.<br />The  casualty figures fly beyond the mind's grasp: 58,000 Americans killed,  4,400 South Koreans, 500 Australians and New Zealanders, 180,000 Cambodians  (with another million perishing under the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and  1978), a half-million South Vietnamese and an estimated 1.1 million North  Vietnamese and Viet Cong.<br />&quot;Reporting Vietnam&quot; starts with Time  Magazine's report on the first U.S. advisers killed in South Vietnam, then  continues chronologically with the inevitability of the Zapruder film of  John Kennedy's murder ride. It moves with reports from the field -- a  report on a Viet Cong massacre in the Ca Mau Peninsula, Neil Sheehan's  account on South Vietnamese troops refusing to fight in the battle of Ap  Bac, to Joseph Alsop's profile of South Vietnam's president Ngo Diem, from  the scenes in Washington of President Johnson and his advisers defending  their policies to Tom Wolfe's account of Ken Kesey disrupting an anti-war  rally in Berkeley and Norman Mailer's self-important essay about the March  on the Pentagon.<br />Then there are the incidents, as bizarre as any  recounted in &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot; The American-run television  channel presenting the German opera &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; backed by  the American Chamber of Commerce; Gloria Emerson reporting the idea by the  head of the Civil Operations and Rural Development Support, challenging his  fellow CORDS members to participate in the 1971 decathlon comprising  &quot;bridge, tennis, gin rummy, volleyball, nautical sports, Chinese  chess, winetasting, close harmony, etc.&quot; (Emerson, who had spent two  years in the field as a correspondent, quoted and commented on Richard  Funkhouser's memo: &quot;`It is always open house here at Bienhoa for  competitors,' Funkhouser wrote, in that playful spirit so many of us in  Vietnam really lacked.&quot;)<br />While movies and TV news reports will fade  with time, this will remain as a monument to show the madnessa and  unreality of this terrible war.r  rally in Berkeley and Norman Mailer's self-important essay about the March  on the Pentagon.  <br />Then there are the incidents, as bizarre as any  recounted in &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot; The American-run television  channel presenting the German opera &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; backed by  the American Chamber of Commerce; Gloria Emerson reporting the idea by the  head of the Civil Operations and Rural Development Support, challenging his  fellow CORDS members to participate in the 1971 decathlon comprising  &quot;bridge, tennis, gin rummy, volleyball, nautical sports, Chinese  chess, winetasting, close harmony, etc.&quot; (Emerson, who had spent two  years in the field as a correspondent, quoted and commented on Richard  Funkhouser's memo: &quot;`It is always open house here at Bienhoa for  competitors,' Funkhouser wrote, in that playful spirit so many of us in  Vietnam really lacked.&quot;) <br />While movies and TV news reports will fade  with time, this will remain as a monument to show the madnessa and  unreality of this terrible war.	2000-09-03

Uncle Trouble. Cooper returns the favor by hiring them to  babysit his daughter and protect her from his ex-wife, now working as a  model in New York City.<br />Keith Snyder has a way of capturing  contemporary speech that's free-flowing and sometimes confusing or obscure.  His characters trade barbs and jokes, sometimes in the same paragraph, they  fight and make up or not. A story arc may go in one direction, hang a right  turn at the last moment and head into uncharted territory. While the fun is  more muted this time around, when it shows up it's all the more amusing  from trenchent observations about New York (my favorite: &quot;Brooklyn is  like Manhatten only shorter.&quot;) to the inclusion of a bedtime story  &quot;The Little Clam that Liked to Dance Even Though It Had No Feet&quot;  and &quot;The Wonky,&quot; a short-short story that plays a pivotal role in  the conclusion. This is a book where the pain is real, the regret palatable  and the consequences of even the best of intentions sometimes fatal.	2000-09-03

The case is sensitive in a number of ways: the  victim was co-owner of a company selling time-shares to its hotels in  Majorca and being investigated by the Fraud Squad, and one of the suspects  is a member of Parliament.<br />But William Price's proved timely for a  number of other suspects as well. The payout from his life insurance policy  would keep the police away and save the business that threatens to sink his  wife and business partner. It would also his two sons' trust fund that he  raided to pay bills for expensive houses, a yacht, and other perks.<br />All  of this would not have involved Francesca, except that Annabelle, the  girlfriend of one of the sons, checks into the women's shelter where she's  working. As she's counseling her, she also becomes involved with the  shelter's attorney, a handsome young man who sparks a number of conflicting  feelings in her. McLeish is tempted on the job as well when a former flame  is charged with investigating the company.<br />&quot;A Timely Death&quot;  has the possibility of turning into a very hot book, part soap opera, part  mystery, but we end up with a cool, conventional story that doesn't seem to  make much of an effort to distinguish itself. Francesca's estrangement from  her husband due to his long hours seems shallow and unconvincing, and makes  her a unlikable lead. Left to his own devices, John is a cipher, meaning  the suspects have to carry the load. Only the Annabelle's growth as a  character, the competent doctor dealing with her bullying boyfriend, gives  &quot;A Timely Death&quot; its emotional power..	2000-09-03

Winnington to discover the identify of a crank caller, Hastings moves among  the habitues of the publishing world, interviewing Winnington's agent,  publicist, and two editors, one of whom rewrote his first book into a  best-seller before being fired. But two interviews lead directly to two  murders, and before long, Hastings manages to attract the attention of  someone who wants him dead as well. <br />Like all of the other books, this is  a fast-paced tale that gives Hall plenty of room to indulge in comic dialog  that can at times sounds like he's channeling Abbott and Costello. But  along the way, &quot;Suspense&quot; also picks up an entertaining subtext  that takes Winnington's flat declaration that no author can write a  suspense novel told from the hero's perspective. Hall takes up the  challenge, and whips up a virtuoso performance. Hastings may object to his  author's interference, especially when it leaves him in a situation in  which there was no way out. Parnell Hall brings off this effect with  panach; it's lucky that Hastings has Hall on his side.	2000-09-03

What are we to make of a New York City mayor who packs a Glock, wrestles corrupt cops and crooked politicians at the same time he is running as  second banana in a presidential campaign? You get Issac Sidel, a.k.a. the  Big Guy, a.k.a. the Citizen, and the funhouse world created by Jerome  Charyn, once of the Bronx, now of Paris.<br />&quot;Citizen Sidel&quot; is a  small book -- less than 220 pages -- but Sidel's a loose cannon who runs  everywhere except off the page. He barely keeps ahead of the other  characters, who are equally bizarre: the 12-year-old daughter of his  running mate, the love of his life who's in bed with the president, and the  son of a police officer, once thought dead, who resurrects himself as the  protector of an inner-city neighborhood, accompanied by a large rat named  Raskolnikov. Sidel himself is a thoroughbred on amphetimines, barely  keeping ahead of those who want to see his campaign derailed. He moves in a  shadow world of plots and counter-plots that may or may not have a tenuous  link in reality.<br />A lot of &quot;Citizen Sidel&quot; has that feeling of  unrealism. Watch Sidel lose a fistfight against a political operative, then  give his acceptance speech on national television, see him fly over the  streets of New York, looking for a 12-year-old tagger, see him campaign in  America's heartland, one voter at a time, without anyone from the media  nearby. He tries to rescue a World War II Romanian dictator from an asylum  and his running mate's daughter from kidnappers and accuses nearly  everybody of secretly working for someone else.<br />In the end,  &quot;Citizen Sidel&quot; reads like an art house movie that seems profound  until you walk out of the theater and try to make sense of it.	2000-09-03

In the days before  the Internet, cable television, tabloid news shows, news of the sightings  were slow to spread, and the story has taken on a life of its own.<br />Flash  forward to the present day, when summer school student and reporter Zoe  Kaplan sees a triangle of lights whizzing through the sky. Her article  makes USA Today and sets off a media firestorm that also attracts a wide  variety of nut cases, including a paramilitary unit who had seen &quot;Mars  Attacks&quot; too many times, a New Ager who channels the alien K-Tel, and  a college professor who may or may not have found a way to prove that  aliens really exist.<br />Susan Holtzer captures the madness and, well,  silliness that surrounds a story that takes on a life of its own. While  there are mysteries to be solved in &quot;The Silly Season,&quot; its  primary pleasures lay in revealing saucer mythology to those of us who had  let our subscriptions lapse to Popular Science (my primary source of UFO  information during the 60s) and Fate magazines. Bet you didn't know America  signed a treaty with the aliens in 1954, allowing them to build secret  bases and carry on human abductions and experiments.  In between sightings  and factional infighting among the true believers, Holtzer also sneaks in  the rationalist point of view as explained by the Snorg Hypothesis (which,  at its heart, is the fact that you can't prove a negative).<br />Lost in all  the action is her detecting couple, police lieutenant Karl Genesko and his  fiancee Anneke Haagen, but that's all right. It's really the story of how  Kaplan learns that pitfalls of ambition in the pursuit of a story, and I  can't tell you how nice it feels to meet a character who gives a credible  imiation of a reporter.  &quot;The Silly Season&quot; is a hoot of a book,  and the temptation to read parts of it aloud is hard to resist. Those who  believe that the &quot;X-Files&quot; is a documentary will find this  offensive in the extreme.

All the suspects will be dead by then. Vlado would agree with them, but in  his inner mind he knew differently. His job was his last link to the life  he knew before the war, before his wife and young daughter became refugees  living illegally in Berlin. For now, he moves through the long days,  marking the shifting tide of the war by counting the graves being dug in  the soccer field below his apartment window and tackling the occasional  murder that was not caused by a sniper.<br /><br />Petric's assignment to  investigate the death of a high police official is meant as proof to the  local U.N. officials that the city is still functioning. The well-marked  trail -- that the official was on the take and was killed when he demanded  too much money -- was meant to lead to a quick report and possibly the  arrest of some unfortunate. But  they didn't reckon on Sarajevo's last  honest detective. Petric's investigation leads him deep into the black  market economy where cigarettes function as currency, gasoline is sold in  glass liter bottles and where men are not above putting the hurt on police  officers asking too many questions.<br /><br />&quot;Lie in the Dark&quot; is a  strong mystery debut by Baltimore Sun journalist Dan Fesperman that  rediscovers the morally shaky worlds of Graham Greene and John le Carre on  the bomb-shattered streets of Sarajevo. Fesperman covered the war and  writes about life in Sarajevo with the confidence and knowledge of a  native. But he does more than report on what he saw. &quot;Lie&quot; is a  beautifully written, sad elegy to a city in agony, and Petric emerges from  the pages as a whole man, with his strong curiosity, an aching need for his  family, and imbued with the very real fear that one misstep, either on  Sniper Alley or while questioning a witness, could lead to an unmarked  grave on a soccer field.family, and imbued with the very real fear that one misstep, either on  Sniper Alley or while questioning a witness, could lead to an unmarked  grave on a soccer field.	2000-09-03

Tony Hillerman? She's  single, in her fourties, dates sometimes and tells her story with that  sometimes world-weary edge of the outsider. Sue Grafton? Plus, when she's  not investigating, she's running her family's 600-acre cattle ranch outside  Tuscon, Arizona. Hmmm, Marnie Davis Kellog, only without the money?<br />No  author would appreciate that kind of treatment, but Trade is composed of  such disparate parts that it was hard to take her seriously at first. It  even seemed a bit of a spoil to pair her with a conventional mystery  involving the murder of a squad of high school cheerleaders 25 years after  the last pom-pom was thrown. A Western noirish title like &quot;The Last  Song Dogs&quot; deserved better.<br />Anyway, cheerleaders we got so we're  stuck with them. Trade went to school with the members of the Song Dogs, so  when three of them died within three months: one by salmonella poisoning,  another shot and robbed, and the third brutally killed, the surviving women  ask Trade to investigate. The resulting mystery runs along conventional  lines. Trade tracks down the remaining Song Dogs, as well as the classmates  who knew them. Some of the women have married well, some haven't, and one  even spent time in jail for manslaughter. There's a creepy character with  an unusual collection, and Trade gets followed and run off the road.  Eventually, she cracks the case, but not before pulling a boneheaded stunt  that had to be done to set up the standard final confrontation. Yet, while  the story ran along conventional lines, Trade is an amiable detective to  follow, and one hopes for a better story next time.	2000-09-03

By quoting from contemporary  records -- everything from letters and diaries to newspapers, handbills and  petitions to county courts and state legislatures -- Franklin and  Schweninger want to show that slaves rebelled against their masters in a  number of ways.<br />The scope of rebellion is breathtakingly wide, ranging  from a sort of civil disobedience -- complaining, refusing to work, hiding  from the overseers, destroying or stealing property, mistreating the  animals, to the more serious offenses such as running away, formenting  rebellion or murder. Any slaves was capable of running off, from known  troublemakers to the most trusted house servants. Even hired slaves, those  who had earned their master's trust and were allowed to accept work in the  cities and generally left alone, would run away.<br />&quot;Runaway  Slaves&quot; spends several hundred pages detailing the various forms of  rebellion, and that is the book's greatest strength and weakness. The sheer  volume and range of these acts makes it clear what the white overlords were  up again, and explains some of the extreme methods used to keep the blacks  down.<br />But the book also doesn't give an indication of the extent of  black rebellion, and thus it offers a case no more convincing than whites  to point out the few blacks who fought for the Confederacy. It would have  been far more effective to look at a particular county over a year and  examine what went on there during that time. By cross-referencing diaries,  newspapers, memoirs and other accounts, it may be possible to discover just  how deep resistance to whites ran.<br /><br />But for those looking for details  of who ran, why, and how they were captured and punished, &quot;Runaway  Slaves&quot; offers a wealth of details and a few choice insights.how deep resistance to whites ran.<br /><br />But for those looking for details  of who ran, why, and how they were captured and punished, &quot;Runaway  Slaves&quot; offers a wealth of details and a few choice insights.	2000-09-03

The city is  treated as well as the book's murder victims.<br />&quot;Multiple  Listing&quot; -- a dull title that describes a service in which a home for  sale can be shown by many real estate agents -- attempts to merge the cozy  mystery with the serial killer genre with mixed results. Sydney Teague is a  divorced mom with two kids, a small ad agency business and a drinking  problem that has been under control for more than eleven years.  Her  comfortable existence is disrupted with a friend of hers is found brutally  raped and murdered. When Sydney discovers that the murder may be connected  with a series of thefts at homes that have been put up for sale through the  Multiple Listing service, Sydney finds herself involved again with a  homicide detective she had dated several years ago.<br />&quot;Multiple  Listing&quot; is packed with attitude and character. Genre writers tend to  soft-pedal their leading character, fearful of offending or putting off  readers. Scarred by alcolholism and a bad marriage, Sydney has the strength  of character that means she takes no nonsense, from her co-workers, her  business competitors, even her detective friend. Call it the Kay Scarpetta  Effect (after Patricia Cornwell's character), but this is obviously a woman  born to lead. One can easily imagine her rushing off to investigate a  murder involving her friends.<br />Nor does Grant dilute Sydney's distate for  Charlotte, a city the author lived in for a decade. In the first few pages  alone, Sydney is musing on a city with &quot;lots of services but very few  tangible products.&quot;  &quot;Like a newly rich southern woman eager to  buy her way into social prominence. Charlotte is a New South city, full of  herself with polite aggression, portending to the crown of shifting  economic futures, hoping Atlanta will slip, pretending she has no  past.&quot; Wap, wap, wap!<br />Weighing in at 325 pages, &quot;Multiple  Listing&quot; could have used a firmer editorial hand.

It's also  a cookbook with recipes for  chutney ham rolls, baked caramel apples and garlic grilled okra. It's an  advice book with hints for making custard, peeling cucumbers and telling  the difference among English, American, Dijon, German and Chinese mustards.<br />Weaving their way among these mini-essays are 1,500 thoughts, one-liners  and musings about food. Author Sharon Tyler Herbst casts a wide net for her  quotations, from Arab emir Abd-al Kadir (&quot;Coffee is the common man's  gold, and like gold, it brings to every man the feeling of luxury and  nobility.&quot;) to writer and editor William Zinsser (&quot;[The hot dog]  . . . a twin pillar of democracy along with Mom's apple pie. In fact, now  that Mom's apple pie comes frozen and baked by somebody who isn't Mom, the  hot dog stands alone.&quot;) Alongside familiar faces like Julia Child and  James Beard are the unexpected, like Miss Piggy, who supplied this book's  title.<br />Herbst spices the mix with her own ruminations on the sensuous  joys of frozen grapes, the mythological origins of mint and why onions make  you cry. With so much variety, it would be impossible not to find something  that makes you laugh or think, or head for the fridge.	2000-09-03

Wiley did  in his two books on Billy Yank and Johnny Reb. Except, where Wiley  concluded that by the end of the war, the soldiers were fighting more to  end the conflict rather than for ideological grounds, McPherson found  evidence from the letters that the soldiers maintained their high ideals --  to preserve the United States on the Union side, and to preserve individual  freedoms (even the freedom to enslave others) on the Confederate side --  through the end of the war. He also noted that it was a time when the words  patriotism, honor and courage had value, and that it motivated soldiers  into being willing to fight and die for their causes. Reading &quot;For  Cause &amp; Comrades&quot; leaves one wondering just how we lost those  ideals, and what will replace them in the battles of tomorrow.	2000-09-03

Call her a comedienne whose Fox television show launched &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; and you short-change her  work as a pop singer, able to attract Paul McCartney to appear in her first  music video, and as an actress who has appeared in movies directed by  Lawrence Kasden, Robert Altman and Woody Allen. She's a comic chameleon in  more ways than one, successfully working in any area she takes a mind to.<br />Her biggest strength is her ability to slip into a variety of  characters, and in her HBO series &quot;Tracey Takes On,&quot; from which  this book is based, Ullman has created 15 women and men, each immediately  recognizable and all daffy in their own way.<br />There's Linda Granger, the  sexpot star of the  70s TV series &quot;VIP Lounge,&quot; making a living  from her residues, her autobiography (&quot;I'm Still Here&quot;) and her  line of Recovery dolls (&quot;each one of them marks a milestone of  survival in my life&quot;); Sydney Kross, demon lawyer (motto: &quot;You  name it, we'll sue it&quot;); Rayleen Gibson, &quot;stuntwoman to the  stars,&quot; who was raised by dingos in the Australian outback and is  married to a dwarf; and gay airline steward Trevor Ayliss (&quot;his  favorite destinations remain Amsterdam, San Francisco and the Greek island  of Mykonos&quot;).<br />With them, Ullman creates stories and incidents whose  humor are rooted in character. But she doesn't stop there. &quot;Tracey  Takes On&quot; combines series footage, scripts, essays and material  created especially for the book to give the characters as much realism as  they appear on the show. A lot of effort went into this book, and the  result is a lovely comic gem of a book.	2000-09-03

Self-described recovering academic Lev Raphael left university teaching for  a full-time writing career. In between producing more literary works -- a  novel, a collection of short stories and an analysis of Edith Wharton's  fiction -- he's also written three witty mysteries skewing the academic  world he left.<br />His comic alter ego, Nick Hoffman, came to the State  University of Michigan to teach classes in the English, American Studies  and Rhetoric Department and to be with Stefan, his partner. He also wants  to make tenure. But his sharp tongue, lack of allies and preference for  teaching over research hurts his chances enough if it weren't for all the  bodies he keeps discovering.<br />By the time Raphael's third book opens,  Hoffman's career is foundering and sinking fast. His involvement as amateur  detective has brought unfavorable publicity to the university, and his  chances darken further by simply being within eyeshot of a murder -- this  time of a young man killed during a melee between a campus preacher and a  group of students.<br />&quot;The Death of a Constant Lover&quot; -- the  title is a reference to 19th-century English novelist Benjamin Constant  --is more a novel of university life and politics than a murder mystery.  The investigation moves in fits and starts as Hoffman finds himself also  dealing with other problems: death threats are being sent to his office  mate, a woman hired to fulfill SUM's diversity quota, and the effect on his  relationship with Stefan when he is dropped by his publisher.<br />Raphael's  third book is slightly darker than his first two. Hoffman's joie de vive is  dampened by the violence around him, making &quot;Death of a Constant  Lover&quot; not so much a darker book -- we're not talking about James  Ellroy here -- but simply not as bright and vivacious than the first two  books. That's not a criticism so much as an observation that Raphael has  put his finger on a key problem with the detecting genre. Death is serious  business, and cracking jokes like Noel Coward around the body doesn't ring  true. And yet, some sense of humor is needed to keep one from turning  Gothic. Homicide detectives and crime reporters tend to develop a callous  form that can be shocking to those who The tradeoff here is that Raphael  has a sure grasp of his leading characters, and &quot;Constant Lover&quot;  is a deeper and more thoughtful mystery that approaches the depth of P.D.

The Sterns have regularly rambled across  this country and have written numerous books on cooking and pop culture,  and their latest book recommends 500 places to eat in the Lower 48, from  Beal's Lobster Pier in Southwest Harbor, Maine, to Andrea's Old Town Cafe,  in Bandon, Oregon.<br />&quot;Eat Your Way&quot; is more inclusive than  &quot;Roadfood&quot; and &quot;Goodfood,&quot; the Stern's previous  guidebooks. They recommend high-end fare such as Fiore's in Las Vegas --  &quot;a swank bistro with a truly interesting menu and elegance more  convincing than the Disney World standards that prevail elsewhere&quot; --  and acidly note places to visit if you happen to be out that way sometime:  The 50's Cafe in North Dakota was introduced with &quot;unable to find a  truly compelling meal in Fargo . . . &quot;<br />South Carolina cuisine rates  high with the Sterns, with no less than a dozen recommendations (twice as  many as found in North Carolina). Five are found in Charleston, and the  rest spread among Spartanburg, Holly Hill, Walterboro, Edisto, Jacksonboro,  Summerton, Mount Pleasant and Columbia<br />What's most impressive about  &quot;Eat Your Way&quot; is the number of compelling places offering tasty  regional fare. There's thin-fried catfish and gumbo at Middendorf's in Pass  Manchac, Louisiana. Sparks offers steaks and New York City atmosphere so  thick that &quot;we have stormed out wishing we were eating steak in Omaha  or Oklahoma City. It all depends on who you sit near and your ability to  tolerate the impertinence of New York's big spenders.&quot;<br />&quot;Eat  Your Way&quot; does more than any cookbook to showcase the variety and  quality of American cooking, and the Sterns' winning way with words in  describing the succulent meals awaiting the traveler can spark a  spontaneous road trip of your own.<br />&quot;Eat  Your Way&quot; does more than any cookbook to showcase the variety and  quality of American cooking, and the Sterns' winning way with words in  describing the succulent meals awaiting the traveler can spark a  spontaneous road trip of your own.	2000-09-03

Dr. Arthur Sokoloff is a dentist who  discovered, on a number of trips to the Far East, Buddahism,  Zen and other  religions. He views life through equally rose-colored glasses, and seeks to  encourage us to mend our spiritually deprived Western lives with an  infusion of Far Eastern beliefs.<br />His gee-whiz writing betrays a  considerable lack of depth and a profound belief in his abilities as a  spiritual leader. &quot;In writing this book, I have stripped away more  than two thousand years of material that has clouded the original wisdom of  the great thinkers of Asia,&quot; he proclaims.

US	52930352	R3LPMPWT2AMKJP	0786212101	918334	Scam	Books	5	27	27	N	N	Underrated humorous mystery series	I mean this in the nicest possible way, but Stanley Hastings -- Parnell Hall's New York private investigator -- is not the sharpest knife in the  drawer, if you know what I mean. But he is the funniest p.i. in mysteries  today.<br />Don't misunderstand me. Hastings has enough brains to handle his  job, which mostly involves recruiting accident victims for the attorney he  works for. But when it comes to a real case, the reactions of the people  who know him -- his boss, Richard Rosenberg, his short-suffering wife,  Alice (who loves him, but doesn't take as a personal insult his lack of  mental acuity) and his contact on the police force, Sgt. MacAuliff -- all  respond in the same way: &quot;Somebody hired you?&quot;<br />In  &quot;Scam,&quot; Hall's 12th book, Hastings is hired by a man who chatted  up a girl in a bar, and woke up hours later on the street. The man feels he  is being set up, but he doesn't know by whom or why. Hastings finds the  girl, but that is the last easy thing that happens, as New York's most  hapless detective bumbles into a scheme involving a company's proxy fight  and Hastings becomes suspect number one in three murders.<br />Hall's books  are characterized by dialog-friendly writing and tight plotting, and the  shaggy-dog feel of &quot;Scam&quot; is funny as it is clever. Stanley, too,  can be a kick to watch working. While he's an easy target, he's also decent  and honorable, worrying as much as Nintendo's moral effect on his son as  the three murder charges have on him. Despite the humiliation and ribbing  he receives, he presses onward, which makes him -- surprise, surprise! --  an admirable figure. While waiting for the refrigerator light to go on  inside Hastings' head, Hall throws in enough plot twists and genial insults  to keep the reader's attention until the inevitable and satisfying finish.	2000-09-03

Not irritated, bothered, vexed or harassed. He's angry, in the same fashion as Mark Twain, who wrote the following:  &quot;I don't ever seem to be in a good enough humor with anything to  satirize it; no, I want to stand up before it &amp; curse it, &amp; foam at  the mouth -- or take a club and pound it to rags &amp; pulp.&quot;<br />Fortunately for his book, &quot;The Alphabet of Modern Annoyances,&quot;  Steinberg doesn't take a club to politicians, the workplace, victims,  Disney and Elvis. What he does do is line them up, in alphabetic order, no  less, and bash at each of them for a couple of pages -- short, measured  doses of hilarity mixed with fact -- before moving on to the next target.  In the court of law, Steinberg would be convicted of drive-by satirizing.<br />And yet, Steinberg indulges in the non-humorist's attribute of fairness.  Almost all his essays have that quality of giving his target an even break.  Although always disliking Disney in general (&quot;Disneyland seems like  hell to me, the Hieronymus Bosch &quot;Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;  version, with weird creatures and tortured denizens scrabbling over each  other trying to find a way out.&quot;), he's not satisfied with leaving it  there. He forces himself to articulate his passionate hatred of all things  Disneyfied: its blandness, its desire to take our basic cultural heritage  and drain them of the things that make them interesting in the first place  to make them most appealing to the widest possible audience.<br /><br />Even  that, to Steinberg, is not enough. &quot;We live in a world of bland smarm.  Disney is no worse than -- I don't know, &quot;Hello Kitty,&quot; or  &quot;Polly Pocket,&quot; or &quot;My Little Pony,&quot; or any of those  warm fuzzies designed to pick the pockets of the young.&quot;<br />He even  looks to the left-wing Disney critics, and finds them more abhorrent than  the object of their criticism.<br />Finally, Steinberg zeroes in on the  undercurrent of totalitarianism that underlies the Disney  &quot;experience.&quot; The theme parks have taken the idea behind mass  entertainment -- the letting loose of strictures, the temporary rebellion  against society's constraints, and perverted it into something that's more  constrained, more limited than real-life. &quot;The implication is that our  society has decayed so much that people will fly to Florida and pay $33 to  walk down a main street that isn't cluttered with crack vials and dozing  junkies.&quot;<br />(Maybe, but another thought came to mind as I was writing  this. Perhaps we live in a society where the mockery of cultural values has  become an everyday occurrence, not something performed the week before  Lent. We have corporate honchos who crow about the number of loyal  employees they've axed, pop stars acting as poster children of sluttery,  professional athletes caught with prostitutes and drugs and awarded with  multi-million dollar contracts, and painters, sculptures, &quot;performance  artists&quot; and architects to whom craftsmanship and beauty are as taboo  to them as revealing how much you make in a year is to anyone else.

They were wealthy, artistic and talented, with three  beautiful, loving children and a circle of friends who became famous and  accomplished in their own right. They gave wonderful parties that are still  remembered a half-century later, were generous to those in need, and best  of all, Gerald and Sara loved each other deeply, with an affection that  grew as they lived their lives to the inevitable, bitter end.<br /><br />Anyone  who has read into the lives of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald,  Picasso and the other expatirot residents of Paris in the 1920s will  recognize Gerald and Sara, perhaps unfavorably as hanger-ons who supplied  the money the others lived on. That unfair assessment is turned on its head  in Amanda Vaill's dual biography of the couple.<br />The Murphys were more  than a bank account who gave parties; celebrity bottom feeders more  interested in status than in accomplishments. They were something of an  oddity. Both were from wealthy families, yet both wanted more than the  family life they craved. Gerald had an eye for art, music and decorating;  it was amazing to learn he was first to boost many artists who later became  famous; &quot;Grandchildren,&quot; he said as he showed them a copy of  &quot;Meet the Beatles.&quot; &quot;Pay attention. These young men are  going to be very, very important.&quot;<br />From their village in the  Antibes, which was a backwater when they discovered it, they befriended  people like Hemingway and Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Archibald Macleish,  Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett as well, while Gerald became famous in  his own right for his finely detailed studies of mechanical devices: a  watch, a machine, of a boat deck and smokestacks.<br />But if there's  anything experience teaches us, it's that no one really leads a charmed  life. It's all filled with day-to-day worries, irritations, tragedies and,  with luck, some glory. But Gerald and Sara came close -- the 20s were their  time -- and it's a fine thing to finish a biography of someone and find  that you like them even more than before.th luck, some glory.

Technically, you're correct, but  classic can also imply that it's timeless and valuable, and that would not  accurately this book.<br />&quot;Reader's&quot; is a classic mystery in that  it resembles the immature side of the genre, where the characters are  cardboard cutouts mounted on sticks, moved hither and yon in order to solve  a series of murders that are puzzling, but, in this case, are not very  engaging. The murders are recreations of those found in classic mysteries,  complete with taunting notes sent to the department's chief of detectives,  Harvey Goldstein. Since Goldstein is accompanies by a visiting British  police officer, and both are mystery fans, the murders become springboards  for discussions of the genre with Goldstein's assistant (and mystery-free)  Sgt. John Bogdanovich.<br />It is possible to write a contemporary mystery  with references to the genre; Peter Lovesey's fine &quot;Bloodhounds&quot;  comes to mind.

The inhabitants of a duplex in  Oxfordshire symbolize this clash between the old and new. The ancient  building with large back lot, once used to house farm families, is now  split between Bodicote, the elderly village eccentric who keeps goats and  has a wandering eye, and Liam and Sally Caswell, a professional couple who  moved from London to the peaceful countryside so that Liam, a scientist  whose research involved beagles, can write a book based on his work.<br />Trouble shows up swiftly. Liam's a dragon whose short fuse and total  lack of manners has enraged nearly everyone he's met. Bodicote and he have  already clashed over the goats getting into his garden, and Boticote's  habit of barging into their house led to numerous unpleasant scenes.  Bodicote's also angry at Sally when she fed his goats turnips and  unknowingly spoilt their milk for awhile.<br />Then a letter bomb goes off,  nearly killing Sally.

In general, they're unpleasant to be around, and  saved only from total ostracism by the brilliance of their work. Granger's  Mitchell and Markby are good people in the tradition of the classic  characters, and she leaves the bad attitudes, shaky morals and addictive  habits to her villains, such as the wonky thirtysomething son of the lady  of the manor, who share the same manorial home and lead the local animal  rights group.<br />&quot;A Touch of Mortality&quot; is full of twists and  turns in the second half that led this reader to continue turning pages  long after bedtime, and ends with a satisfactory climax in which justice  triumphs and the guilty get punished, sometimes in ways that have nothing  to do with the legal system.

Life had taken a turn some years back -- a sudden turn, like a  leaf just off the rapids finding itself among a hundred other leaves in  slow-moving backwater. I was just now beginning to see that life is best on  the rapids.&quot;<br />Those who want to see what is possible to accomplish  with a historical mystery need look no further than Richard Moquist's debut  novel involving Sadie Greenstreet, the discontented wife of a Pinkerton  agent who gets a chance to investigate a steamboat slaying on the  post-Civil War Mississippi River.<br />Although happily married and with a  career of her own as a Chicago journalist, Sadie knows something is  missing. So when her husband is again to be sent away on a mission, she  puts her foot down, determined to go along with him. Sent to ensure the  safety of a river boat owner being pressured to sell out, she gets an  opportunity to see a way of travel slowly being eclipsed by the railroads,  and when the owner is found dead, at his writing desk, she gets to try her  hand at detecting the not-so-gentle art of murder.<br />Moquist tells their  story briskly and economically, using the vivid vernacular and descriptions  from those times in a way that Dianne Day and Elizabeth Peters does not. A  generous selection of photographs and illustrations, cleverly mingled among  the text, are included. By the end of this tale, Sadie discovers what was  missing, and with a telegraph from Alan Pinkerton in hand asking them to  investigate a troubled baseball team in Cincinnati, the foundations are  laid for an engaging and much-anticipated series.	2000-09-03

Has  it really been nearly a quarter-century since the black and white images of  the helicopters taking off from the roof of the American Embassy faded from  our television screens? Grenada, Panama, Iraq -- three wars and God knows  how many humanitarian efforts (Somalia, Yugoslavia, did I miss any?)<br />Yet, the power of memory is such that it doesn't take much to bring it  all back. Dipping into these compilations of writings about Vietnam -- the  original reportage and memoirs in the Library of America volumes and the  best of everything else in &quot;The Vietnam Reader&quot; -- shards of  long-forgotten memories were struck just by reading the names of towns and  villages. Khe Sahn, Haiphong: The words sound so completely alien, as if  they had been coined by H.P. Lovecraft. They trigger memories of tracing  the S-curve of the countries on maps in the newspapers, seeing the  photographs in Life magazine -- for me, the 1960s will always be remembered  as a series of black and white freeze-frames from the magazines, with color  reserved only for the more silly stories found in the back of the book --  and hearing them recited on TV in the stentorian tones of Walter  Cronkitethe  who would recite the weekly casualty figures, printedon screen  before the national flags, like baseball scores,  while the family ate our  meat loaf and mashed potatoes and waited for Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom  to come on at 7.<br />Time has passed and in this media-drenched age, so much  history has been created, screened and absorbed over the past  quarter-century. Vietnam and Cambodia became a backwater in the American  consciousness, flaring up from time to time in response to specific, finite  events such as the debate over Agent Orange, the construction of the  Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the screening of &quot;Platoon&quot; and  &quot;The Killing Fields,&quot; and the debate over draft evasion by Bill  Clinton, Dan Quayle, Phil Gramm and Newt Gingrich.<br />For those of us who  were not there, who can view the war almost dispassionately, it is this  lack of intervening history that makes these books so powerful and painful  to read. This is a chronicle of a nation marching deeper and deeper into a  war that the journalists there saw as early as 1965 -- about 150 pages into  two volumes that total more than 1,600 pages -- could not be won the way it  was being run. Historians will probably argue eternally if it could have  been won at all. The repressive and corrupt South Vietnamese government  could not win enough &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of the people to defeat  the Viet Cong, and an invasion of North Vietnam could have triggered a  Korean War-style invasion from China. It took nearly a decade for the  United States to find the way out of that bloody tunnel and another two  decades before full diplomatic relations were reestablished.<br />The  casualty figures fly beyond the mind's grasp: 58,000 Americans killed,  4,400 South Koreans, 500 Australians and New Zealanders, 180,000 Cambodians  (with another million perishing under the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and  1978), a half-million South Vietnamese and an estimated 1.1 million North  Vietnamese and Viet Cong.<br />&quot;Reporting Vietnam&quot; starts with Time  Magazine's report on the first U.S. advisers killed in South Vietnam, then  continues chronologically with the inevitability of the Zapruder film of  John Kennedy's murder ride. It moves with reports from the field -- a  report on a Viet Cong massacre in the Ca Mau Peninsula, Neil Sheehan's  account on South Vietnamese troops refusing to fight in the battle of Ap  Bac, to Joseph Alsop's profile of South Vietnam's president Ngo Diem, from  the scenes in Washington of President Johnson and his advisers defending  their policies to Tom Wolfe's account of Ken Kesey disrupting an anti-war  rally in Berkeley and Norman Mailer's self-important essay about the March  on the Pentagon.<br />Then there are the incidents, as bizarre as any  recounted in &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot; The American-run television  channel presenting the German opera &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; backed by  the American Chamber of Commerce; Gloria Emerson reporting the idea by the  head of the Civil Operations and Rural Development Support, challenging his  fellow CORDS members to participate in the 1971 decathlon comprising  &quot;bridge, tennis, gin rummy, volleyball, nautical sports, Chinese  chess, winetasting, close harmony, etc.&quot; (Emerson, who had spent two  years in the field as a correspondent, quoted and commented on Richard  Funkhouser's memo: &quot;`It is always open house here at Bienhoa for  competitors,' Funkhouser wrote, in that playful spirit so many of us in  Vietnam really lacked.&quot;)<br />With respect to the Vietnam veteran who  reviewed this collection, it should be pointed out that this is not a  history book.

Ike is a woman, Abby a man, and if you  can keep that in mind, then it won't bother you as much as it annoyed me.  She's the producer of a network morning show, her ex the show's director.  Although divorced, they work together, compete in ballroom dance  competitions and skate the streets of New York on Rollerblades. Since Abby  didn't want the divorce the books provide plenty of opportunities for  bickering, misunderstandings and the possibility of a reconciliation.<br />But the wheels quickly come off this &quot;Moonlighting&quot; on  Rollerblades. The mystery, involving the murder of New York Knicks star  center, Archie &quot;Big Chill&quot; Thorpe, is loaded with  improbabilities, starting with the notion that someone could stand ten rows  from the courtside during a pre-game warm-up, shoot Thorpe and escape  without being seen.<br />Now, &quot;Moonlighting&quot; didn't make people  forget Agatha Christie, but the sparks between Dave and Maddie made up for  it. Ike shows little interest in Abby, whose whining, posturing and bad  jokes deaden the sections that display Whitney's talent for manic humor.	2000-09-02

Estleman. His vision of the city, as seen through the jaundiced eye of Amos  Walker, private investigator, is nearly uniformly morose, a city on the  greased skids to palookaville, a one-hit wonder whose 15 minutes has been  over for an hour and a half.<br />But like the city, the Motor City  investigator keeps on trucking in the 13th novel of this highly praised  series. Walker agrees to help a curator at the Detroit Institute of Arts to  help recover a recently stolen medieval illuminated manuscript. But the  meeting at a rundown porn theater is interrupted when Walker is  distractedby a young woman, then shot at. When the smoke clears, the woman,  the manuscript and the curator have all disappeared.<br />While tracking down  the leads, Walker is also following a trail into his past. Twenty years  ago, Dale Leopard, his boss and mentor, was found dead while on a case, and  Earl North, the man who beat the charge, has reappeared, seeking the  manuscript. Is there a connection between the murder and the Hours? Did  North really kill Leopard?<br />Estleman writes like an aria; his prose sings  with metaphors and observations that strike just the right note. He's been  around long enough so that comparing him to Dashielle Hammett and Raymond  Chandler isn't an original thought, but it's true and it'll have to do. He  gives Detroit its unique identity of a crumbling and crooked but proud city  trying to find itself.	2000-09-02

His friend and fellow actor, Seymour Loseby, died suddenly, and a volume of his diaries is missing.  Seymour's son, a government minister and rising star in the political  establishment, has received a threat to publish its contents unless paid a  hundred thousand pounds. He turns to Fletcher to act as go-between.<br />But  the black-hearted actor has powerful reasons of his own to recover the  missing volume. Now nearing the end of his career, he hopes not only to get  a knighthood out of it from the grateful minister, but to suppress the  contents of the missing book, which contained details of Philip's unsavory  involvement in a couple of murders.<br />Philip's knightly quest draws him  into a world of transvestite nightclubs and gangsters, and the aging actor  has to draw on all his thespian skills, with an assist from blackmail and  the occasional murder, to survive.<br />&quot;The Company of Knaves&quot;  contains more than a whiff of the theater's greasepaint, and author Simon  Shaw, flings acid-tinged darts thrown with great glee at actors and  actresses, entertainers, and just about everything British. Amid this  filthy world of cynicism and violence, Fletcher is still a trouper at  heart, and the show must go on no matter what.	2000-09-02

Fortunately for Chase, there is plenty of scandal to be found. Jackson  lived a life on the frontier, where duels were as common as breathing, and  where those with a lick of sense and an ounce of ambition -- and Jackson  had more than enough of both -- were not above using any means to get  ahead.<br />But it's Rachel, Jackson wife of 38 years, who had the potential  of providing the juiciest bits of gossip. Although we first meet her as a  pious, elderly woman, content to smoke her corncob pipe on the veranda of  their home, the Hermitage, she was considered a vivacious beauty in her  youth, when Andrew eloped with her to escape an abusive marriage. They were  married, and lived together for two years before discovering that her first  husband neglected to file divorce papers. Bigamy, no matter how accidental  nor how long ago, was still a powerful charge in 1828.<br />Worse, rumors are  about that Rachel that she was involved with another man while still  married to her first husband. If Chase can find proof, he could set alight  the charge that would dynamite Jackson's campaign.<br /><br />The second, more  subtle, story has to do with America of the 1820s, making its way from  being a stepchild of Great Britain to something reflecting its native  character, an uneasy mix of sectional rivalries and class distinctions that  can still be seen today. Chase observes this growing-up process with the  eye of a Parisian, where he lived for many years and desperately wants to  return. He is at times horrified by this country under construction, its  rough ways and abusive life. Byrd expertly recreates this America in vivid  prose mingled with deeply dug-up facts about everyday life in this newly  minted country. We are rewarded, for example, with a glimpse of John Quincy  Adams, the president and Jackson's rival, uneasily presiding at a White  House reception, open to all, and jammed with politicians, diplomats and  what passed for tourists in those days, all on the make. He fared better  than Jackson, whose inaugural parade degenerated into an all-out assault  and looting of the White House by the &quot;common people&quot; who voted  him in.<br />Chase also experiences this shaping of America personally in a  love affair with Emma Colder, a woman who finds the invisible ties that  bind her sex loosened in her new land.<br />As a historical novel,  &quot;Jackson&quot; doesn't rip through its time like freight train.  Popular novelists like John Jakes would have juiced up the love story, made  the hero handsomer and put in a few fist fights and gun battles (although  Byrd's recounting of the Battle of New Orleans provides enough gore on that  score). Byrd paces his story more leisurely, the way life was lived back  then. He convincingly revives an era when optimism about America's future  was mingled with pessimism over its past, when technology was embraced like  a religion, and when social inequalities were blatant and considered  justified.

If &quot;Dying to Get Even&quot; was a dog, it would probably be a Labrador retriever: not too bright but bouncy and eager to please.<br />Jennifer Marsh, like her name, is mired in her career as an unpublished  writer. Her two books about distaff P.I. Maxie Malone have not sold, and  while she's beginning her third novel, a friend of hers is caught in what  may be considered a standard opening of a mystery. The wealthy ex-wife of  the founder of an Atlanta chain of steak restaurants if found over his body  of her ex-husband with her hand on the murder weapon. Since Jennifer was  the first on the murder scene, her testimony could help convict her friend.<br />Nervous and not at all like her fictional alter ego, Jennifer is one of  mystery's more neurotic ladies. She's aided in her quest to find the real  killer by the members of her writing group, who seem to reflect their  particular genres. Their attempts to investigate the case complicates  Jennifer's life a lot, as does the presence of two reporters, a boyfriend  from the Atlanta newspaper, and a tabloid slimebag.<br />In &quot;Dying to  Get Even&quot; are the seeds of a very funny parody of genre writing.  Jennifer finds herself in a Maxie Malone-type of case, only without her  character's wits, skills and talent. At one point, the confirmed vegetarian  also briefly runs one of the restaurants. It feels like Judy Fitzwater  knows there's something funny about all this, and she's tosses Jennifer  about in an attempt to find out. The story has the depth of a &quot;Murder,  She Wrote&quot; episode, one can't be too hard on it. Jennifer and her  friends are a genial bunch of girls -- their involvement in the case  complicates matters mightily -- and one can't help rooting for them.	2000-09-01

Instead of the seedy detective in the rundown office with a bottle in his  desk, there's the single working woman living in an attractive area,  sometimes with a police officer boyfriend to help, with a job that brings  her regularly in contact with corpses. Oh, and no kids.<br />&quot;Death at  High Tide&quot; might serve as the perfect example on the genre. Free-lance  writer Anne Hardaway lives by herself in a beautiful Victorian in a small  ocean-side town in southern New Jersey. A movie crew has come to her town,  which gives her the opportunity to help its star, Mallory Loving, ghost her  memoirs. The one variation from the mystery template is that the cop  boyfriend is replaced by an architect who's working in Europe and pleading  with her to come visit.<br />Researching the life of this platinum blonde  diva takes Hardaway among the usual suspects, including La Loving's  handsome singer/actor husband who may be having a fling or two on the side,  her ambitious assistant who's angling for something greater, the director  with a shady past, the boyfriend Loving left behind who still holds a flame  for her and Mallory's twin sister, who never left the shore and became a  bingo-playing spinster teacher.<br />Beth Sherman is an experienced magazine  and newspaper writer and &quot;Death at Hide Tide&quot; pops along with  plenty of plot twists to satisfy the most committed mystery reader. While  there's too much reliance on cliches -- Hardaway is threatened several  times with vague unspecificied variations on &quot;you'll be sorry&quot; if  she publishes some of the more risque factoids she uncovers, and her fear  of losing her publishing contract seems doubtful to any writer aware that  the tabloids would pay handsomely for what Hardaway uncovers -- such  expectations for books like these are never high to begin with.

Her Temperance Brennan is a separated single woman, a  recovering alcoholic and an American working amidst chauvinistic (both  against Americans and women) detectives in Montreal. While all three can be  enough to drive any woman to drink, even on her worst days, she is not as  depressing as Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta. Call her Cornwell Lite.<br />She even  has her own serial killer to contend with; a creep who has already stalked  and dismembered at least two women by the time the book opens during the  summer of 1994, just before the province votes on the question of  separation from Canada.<br />Brennan's problem, however, is that the police  don't buy her story, even after they raid a suspect's apartment and  discover, amid the rotting food, piles of porn and newspaper clippings, a  map of the city with Xs marking the sites of the victims.<br />Brennan is an  appealing character, and Reichs is a fine writer, but &quot;Deja Dead&quot;  has serious plot holes that will leave you scratching your head and  flipping the pages to see if a vital point was missed. Subplots are  underdeveloped, such as the Quebec referendum and Brennan's estrangement  form her husband, and Reichs cripples the story by forcing one character to  withhold vital clues without apparent reason.<br />As a forensic  anthropologist who has worked for the police in Quebec, Reichs has the  professional background to tell Brennan's story. Like Cornwell, she doesn't  hold back when revealing the grisly details (not &quot;grizzly,&quot; as  she writes). But while Reichs has the meat of a popular bestseller here,  she failed to provide the ligaments that will hold it together after the  covers are closed.	2000-09-01

He's a machine, churning  nearly 60 history books on Winston Churchill, the Holocaust, Jewish history  and the two World Wars among other subjects. Without a trace of ego or any  talent for self-promotion, hands down, he earned the title of the hardest  working man in the history biz.<br />With apologies to James Brown, and the  reader as well, Gilbert's brand new bag is this little opus called, &quot;A  History of the Twentieth Century,&quot; slated to come out in three  volumes. The first volume covered one-third of the century, and its sequel  covers the years 1933 to 1951.<br />This is quaint, old-fashioned history,  the kind that drive New Historians batty. Gilbert breaks down the century  into years and writes a chapter on each year. He's not interested in  looking back and drawing inferences and interpretations. He's not even  interested in pointing out trends or advancing any particular political  agenda. This is history in the here and now, as immediate as the day's  newspaper. The result is a book you can open to any page, and be instantly  captivated by the story.<br />Not surprisingly, Hitler and World War II  dominates this book, opening as it does with the rise of the ex-German Army  corporal, consolidating power after only three months in office, and ending  with the executions of his officers for war crimes. Also present in a large  measure is Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union, and their catalog of  cruelties take up most of the book.<br />Those of us who've quite had our  fill of WWII history did not look forward to the prospect of looking back.  I've read the books, seen the documentaries, watched the History Channel  (motto: All Hitler All the Time), visited some of the places and even gamed  the battles and campaigns from tactical to strategic. Could this really  tell me something I haven't learned?<br />As it turns out, it does. Gilbert's  genius in writing history is in constructing a fascinating chain of  stories. His narrative flow is interrupted only when he turns to an extract  from a contemporary account, or by brief footnotes in which Gilbert drops  the authorial mask to relate a personal anecdote or reveals a pertinent  fact that wouldn't otherwise fit into the chronological narrative. His  &quot;here and now&quot; technique means you can dip into the book at any  place and find some interesting nugget of history.<br />The result is  something like an extended mini-series, with the narrative shuttling among  the main characters and locations, with brief subplots that may or may not  be equally important. The 1947 chapter, for example, opens with Gen. George  C. Marshall reporting from China that neither the Communists nor the  Kuomintang want a negotiated settlement or a coalition government.  Following that is a one-page summary of the struggle over the rest of the  year then an eyewitness account of life during the winter in a Manchurian  city under Kuomintang control. After that is a series of brief stories,  many taking less than a page. Various countries execute German officers for  war crimes, German prisoners-of-war are repatriated back to the fatherland,  Britain and France sign a mutual-aid pact against Germany, the coffins of  6,248 American war dead are returned home and given a memorial service in  Central Park, attended by four hundred thousand people, more peace treaties  signed, not-so-free elections held in Poland, the Truman Doctrine was  issued in which anti-Communist aid was given to Greece and Turkey, the  Marshall Plan formulated, the next stage in the decline of the British  Empire formulated with the independence of Burma as led by Aung San, who  was later assassinated.

Sidney is a single mother of two who runs her  public relations agency with the help of two staffers and a revolving door  of salespeople. And instead of a house by the Atlantic or some other  attractive location, Teague works out of Charlotte, N.C. Those who know the  area will recognize the locations, the people and Grant's cutting knowledge  of the city's foibles, from its inability to distinguish itself nationally  to its overweening pride in being a &quot;big city.&quot; The only bow to  convention -- her boyfriend is a homicide detective -- is undercut by her  uncertainty that they have a future together.<br />So Teague lives a life  that's closer to the everyday hurly-burly that her readers will find  familiar. Her time is not her own, even when there's a murder to be solved.  During a long weekend servicing a convention of florists, their wholesalers  and suppliers, she has to cope with her demanding client, her employees and  her children. On top of that, she is shaken when a floral designer she had  known for decades suddenly drops dead at a seminar he was conducting. Then  a convention executive is found stabbed, and Teague finds herself targeted  as well. She soldiers on, but she's clearly shaken, and her subsequent  discoveries carries with them an air of tragedy far graver and more  satisfying than one would expect to find in a paperback. If Anne Underwood  Grant doesn't take care, she may find herself compared with Patricia  Cornwell and James Lee Burke. And who would want that?	2000-09-01

For many, that includes designing and building the homes themselves. But  building a home is a complex project filled with pitfalls and traps, and  unwary budding homeowners can find their dreams turning into nightmares.<br />Enter Mark Smith, who has built several houses of his own. Written by a  man who acted as his own general contractor, &quot;The Owner-Builder  Book&quot; is crammed with useful advice on how to oversee your own  project, from planning to construction. But be warned: it's unflinchingly  honest about the amount of work and stress involved. While Mark Smith  writes that it's possible to build a house in six months, first will come  at least a year of planning and organizing.  Once construction begins,  you'll have to deal with ensuring that subcontractors appear on time and  finish their work on time before the next group of workers appears. You may  also have to deal with problems such as late deliveries of materials,  subcontractors who don't show up, or who demand advances before working,  threatened lawsuits,<br />Reading this book will give you a better  appreciation of what the general contractor goes through. It will either  fire your desire to run the show yourself and pocket the savings, or  gratefully turn over the work to someone who does it for a living. But what  it will also do is give you the information needed to make informed  decisions that, even if you work with a contractor, will save you money.	2000-09-01
US	52930352	RN5FQIIK5AJFU	042515808X	540686278	The Murder of Bob Crane	Books	4	85	91	N	N	As lurid a true-crime book you would wish for	Somewhere in the middle of &quot;The Murder of Bob Crane,&quot; author Robert Graysmith recalls a quotation by Paul Theroux along the lines of how  murder halts the victim's life in mid-stride, revealing more about that  person than they would want revealed. When death is anticipated, there is  time to put things away, make one's peace, and write your obituary. But the  murdered person leaves their life open to examination by all.<br />Not that  Bob Crane was hiding all that much by the time he was found bludgeoned to  death in a Scottsdale, Arizona, hotel room in 1978. His friends, co-workers  and ex-wives knew of his passion for pornography, his relentless pursuit of  women, and his interest in photography and videotape. He would brag of his  conquests, and even casual visitors to his home may be shown his collection  of Polaroid prints depicting he and sometimes his friends in numerous  positions and acts.<br />But it took the death of the former &quot;Hogan's  Heroes&quot; for his hobby to become known to the public, and Robert  Graysmith is unrelenting in his quest for details about the case.<br />Unlike  its more powerful brethren like &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and &quot;Fatal  Vision,&quot; &quot;The Murder of Bob Crane&quot; will not become a  classic. Graysmith's pursuit of detail is meticulous and overwhelming, and  shows no sign of discrimination, down to informing us that the carpet at  CBS's executive headquarters is blue. His prose is overwrought at times, as  padded as a down jacket in others. He repeats facts, sometimes pages apart  and usually using the same words, and the dialog has the scent of the  make-believe. His characterizations are non-existent, leaving us to fill in  the gaps. One gets the impression that large portions of the book were  written by opening the notebook and dumping in its contents.<br />After  describing Crane's activities in Scottsdale the month before his murder --  he was appearing in a dinner theater play ironically titled  &quot;Beginner's Luck&quot; -- and the opening phases of the murder  investigation, Graysmith jumps into a biography of Crane and particularly  the creation and production of &quot;Hogan's Heroes.&quot; While this  material has little to do with the murder case, the 70 pages fills the book  to a publishable 289 pages. Fans of the show -- and those who wonder just  how in the hell a sit-com set in a German POW camp during World War II  could be a ratings hit on American television -- will be fascinated by the  tale.<br />&quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot; was the stepchild of &quot;Sgt.  Bilko,&quot; and the show's creator Bernard Fein, was trying to sell  without success an offshoot set in a federal penitentiary. In fact, Fein  had given up, and was at the airport about to leave Hollywood when he spied  a fellow passenger reading &quot;Von Ryan's Express,&quot; a novel in which  POWs hijack a German train carrying stolen art. Inspiration struck, aided  by the recent success of &quot;Stalag 17,&quot; and the rest, as they say,  is television history.<br />Three of &quot;Hogan's&quot; cast members, all  Jews, were affected by the war in ways that makes one wonder why they would  involve themselves in such a project. Robert Cleary, who played the  Frenchman, LeBeau, spent the war in a concentration camp and nearly died at  Buchenwald; the family of Werner Kemperer (who played the German  commandant, Klink) fled Germany before the war; and John Banner, who was  the bumbling but good-hearted Sgt. Schultz, was an Austrian whose family  was killed by the Nazis in 1938. That Banner and Kemperer had spent most of  their careers portraying Nazis is ironic in the extreme, but as Banner  simply commented, &quot;Who can play Nazis better than us Jews?&quot;<br />The book follows &quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot; through its cancellation  after six seasons, and picks up Bob Crane's story, his failed marriages,  his sputtering film career (including two movies at Disney), a second  sit-comthat was canceled, and his stage work. As portrayed by Graysmith,  Bob Crane was not a happy man. He was a genial comic and a thoroughly  professional actor of limited talent., but whose private life was marked by  an urgent need not only to copulate, but to record it. He seemed singularly  incapable of relating to anyone out of bed or off the stage, and the  vignettes of the lonely Crane sitting by himself in restaurants and bars,  drinking grapefruit juice (he did not drink often and never used drugs),  are affecting. One wonders while reading this what would have happened if  he had diverted just a quarter of his energy from seeking sex to growing  his career.<br />Crane's life did not have a happy ending, and that curse was  extended past his dying. The investigation into his murder was marred by  conflicts among the investigating officers, the medical examiners, and the  prosecutors, as well as the inexperience of the detectives (who, after all,  worked in a city that averaged about one murder a year). It was 16 years  before Crane's friend, John Henry Carpenter was arrested, tried and  acquitted of the murder. Carpenter was with Crane in Scottsdale, a video  expert who helped him set up his system (back when the top-of-the-line  model video recorder was a black-and-white Betamax) and participated in  Crane's nocturnal activities. Although found not guilty, examining the  evidence (blood of the same type as Crane's was found in Carpenter's rental  car, and Carpenter's behavior was suspicious the morning after the murder)  leads one to think that a more honest verdict would have been, at least,  not proven.'<br />&quot;The Murder of Bob Crane&quot; is a luridly compelling  read about a sad man whose compulsions ultimately and unwittingly led to  his death.sit-com that was canceled, and his stage work.

St. Martin's Press publishes mysteries like Harliquin produces romances. Upwards of 300 a year are produced in all varieties of genres, each one briefly given its moment on the bookstore shelf before being replaced by the next batch. With this stream flowing across the book reviewer's desk, it's hard for one novel to stand out, particularly a debut book.<br /><br />Yet \\"Let's Get Criminal\\" hooked me from the first page when the arrival of Professor Perry Cross to  the State University of Michigan threatens to unravel the longtime  relationship between professors Nick Hoffman and Stefan Borowski. Hired  under suspicious circumstances, with Borowski's recommendation, Cross  brought with him a well-bred air of menace, so that when his body was found  floating underneath a campus bridge, he left behind plenty of suspects,  including Hoffman and Borowski.<br /><br />But while Cross is at the center of the  mystery, Nick Hoffman is the star of the book. Jealous of the past Cross  and Borowski apparently shared, Hoffman reels from strength to weakness and  back, using his good humor and acidic observations to keep himself  standing. When Cross' death makes them suspects to a homophobic detective,  Hoffman charges into the investigation.<br /><br />\\"Let's Get Criminal\\"  is more than just a mystery story, because Raphael winningly portrays Nick  and Stefan, highlighting their differences and examining how their love  bends and changes under the pressures of the investigation. There's humor  here, but also menace and sadness, and even triumph at the end.<br /><br />The  trade paperback version carries a green banner on the cover announcing it  is part of the \\"Stonewall Inn Mysteries,\\" a series which includes  works by George Baxt, Mark Richard Zubro and Phyllis Knight. While I accept  the idea that gay-themed mysteries should be marketed to gays, I never  thought of \\"Let's Get Criminal\\" in that context. This is a book I  would recommend to anyone who loves mysteries.	2000-09-01

Heinrich Schliemann's inspired use of Homer's Iliad and the  Odyssey to locate Troy still has the power to enthrall, even as we deplore  the methods he used along the way -- smuggling the gold treasures out of  Turkey -- as well as the damage he did in excavating the site. Convinced  that Homer's Troy was found at the bottom of the site, he carted away layer  after layer of unsifted rubble to get there. As it turned out, Troy was  older than even he suspected, and he ended up destroying that layer.<br />The  history of archaeology is full of stories like these: Arthur Evans  rebuilding the Minoan city of Knossos according to his idea of what they  should have looked like (critics call his reconstruction &quot;concrete  Crete&quot;); Colorado rancher Richard Wetherill exploring the pubelos once  occupied by the Anasazis, carting off thousands of relics to sell to  museums; archeologists in general denying that Africans were responsible  for building Great Zimbabwe in order to fulfill their notions of white  supremacy. But &quot;Finding the Lost Cities&quot; points out that time  cannot support a story that is false, and that the truth, eventually, is  sifted out.	2000-09-01

No, this is not a sequel to &quot;The Rules.&quot; &quot;Detecting Men&quot; is a gorgeously produced, well-edited and probably comprehensive  catalog of over 600 men who have written mystery series.<br />Take note of  all those qualifiers, because the format is slightly different from  Heising's companion volume, &quot;Detecting Women 3.&quot; While that  reference (a third edition, hence the &quot;3&quot;) covers all living  female writers and a good portion of those who have since died, space  limitations forced &quot;Detecting Men&quot; to limit itself. So, while  Anna Katherine Green (who wrote mysteries back in the 1880s) and Agatha  Christie are in &quot;DW3&quot; you won't find Ellery Queen and Rex Stout  in &quot;DM.&quot; Even under those restrictions, &quot;Detecting Men&quot;  still offers nearly 450 pages of information, compared with 384 pages in  the other book.<br />So what do you get for your money? A paragraph on each  author accompanied by a checklist of each series book, with notations for  those which were nominated or winners of writing awards like the Edgar,  Anthony and Shamus.<br />While that section is fascinating in itself for the  minutae about the authors, the second half of &quot;DM&quot; contains  charts, charts and more charts that can help the series reader locate all  kinds of information. Readers of police procedurals will find four pages  listing authors, when they wrote, the character's name and profession and  setting. Looking for mysteries involving journalists? &quot;DM&quot; lists  25, from Dick Belsky' reporter Lucy Shannon to Collin Wilcox' Stephen Drake  (a newspaper reporter with ESP). There's 14 small-town sleuths, two  surburban detectives, 15 gay and lesbian detectives and 14 disabled  detectives. Detectives are also listed by first name, settings, the year  they appeared, and by title. The latter category appeals to the trivia buff  in me; not surprisingly, there are a long list of titles beginning with  dead, death, and murder, but I didn't expect 31 beginning with  &quot;gently.&quot; Sounds like the ideal niche for a book collector.<br />The pseudonym section can help straighten out who wrote want, as well as  help find a favorite author's other works.

Like the Grand Canyon or Niagra  Falls, the best one can do is simply stand there, mouth agape and say  something like, &quot;So, there it is.&quot;<br />At 1,640 pages and weighing  in a five and three-quarter pounds (1.48 minas according to the  Attic-Euboic standard or 1.95 Roman libras), this massive reference work  summarizes all that is known about the Greek and Roman worlds. It is a  detailed volume that has plenty of entries for both the specialist and  general reader.<br />But, realistically, at $100 a throw, this dictionary  will be more likely to be purchased by those who have more than a passing  interest in the classical era. They in turn will be rewarded with a volume  that covers nearly every conceivable aspect of Roman and Greek life, from  the public deeds of emperors to the private lives of laborers.<br />Here,  among the academic jargon and bibliographical references, one may learn  that, in Athens, a popular after-dinner game was the  wine-throw,' in which  players would flick the dregs from their cups at a target, such as a saucer  floating in water; that while incest in general was banned, siblings with  the same father could marry in Athens, of the mother in Sparta; that even  mimes existed in both Roman and Greek cultures, sometimes acting out on the  streets stock stories that sound like the sitcoms and soap operas of our  day.<br />Much of the 800 new entries (the editors note that the book is 20  percent larger than the previous edition) focus on the societal aspects,  such as alcoholism, breast-feeding, cannibalism, cemeteries, debt, fairs,  fantastic literature, homosexuality, housework, suicide and tourism, while  the dictionary overall benefitted from archeological discoveries made since  the previous edition.

What's so dangerous? Suffocation by towers of manuscripts?  Rejection of your work by editors? Paper cuts? Who does Frederick Busch  think he is; Richard Branson?<br />No, what this university author's talking  about in this collection of pieces are those writers who take risks with  their works. Not to write the next potboiling, page-turning best-seller,  but something more lasting and more personal. These are writers who live  out their lives according to a sort of literary DNA, doing what they must  at whatever cost to themselves.<br />There's Herman Melville, who felt  himself finished at age 33 because the book he believed in, &quot;Moby  Dick,&quot; had earned him &quot;the scorn of reviewers -- they questioned  his sanity as well as his skill -- and, by the end of his life, a total of  $157.&quot; There's Graham Greene's exquisite career writing about how we  betray love, loyalty, ourselves. Or, as Busch puts it: &quot;follies were  his subject matter, finally -- how, in love, we betray the beloved; how,  worshiping God, or a god, or a hope of one, we betray that hope or wish;  how, striving to do good, we cause damage.&quot;<br />There's Charles  Dickens, whose &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is nothing less than a novel  about writing and the power of the written and spoken word can hold over  its audience. The novel is also a reflection of the man himself, who  carried on stage readings of his works that would leave him exhausted and  probably hastened his end. That's writing capable of killing.<br />But Busch  doesn't sustain the promise implied by the title, so the book's not a  dirge. He leavens it by including essays on bad popular writing and bad  literary criticism, memoirs recalling his early literary career, and a  short humorous look at the writer's life from the point of view of the  (usually) long-suffering wife.<br />It's tough to explain to someone who  doesn't write why putting words on paper can be so difficult, why writers  can turn into divas in their self-absorption and why those who work so hard  to become so good seem capable of sacrificing so much.

Someone has to gather the information  and send the messages that brought the armies together in the first place.  That is the focus of this detailed history of staff work in Lee's Army of  Northern Virginia.<br />When the war began, the Confederacy found itself  having to build everything from scratch, and their army was no different.  Although they borrowed heavily from the U.S. Army's way of doing things, it  eventually became clear that innovations would have to be made, both to  account for the maneuvering of growing armies, but also to deal with the  expanded technology -- railroads, telegraphs and the use of longer and more  accurate weapons -- rarely seen before by fighting men.<br />&quot;Buff  Facings&quot; is a detailed account of how Lee and his generals coped.  While the depth of detail may discourage the general reader, Bartholomees  offers a generous selection of ancedotes that allow for bursts of humanity  to show. In the middle of an account of the development of the Signal  Corps, he relates how Major General Stephen Ramseur received a vitally  important message just before the Battle of Cedar Creek: &quot;The crisis  is over and all is well.&quot; It announced the birth of his daughter.	2000-08-31

Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan are showing their age to the point  where this invaluable guide can become an invaluable, addictive pleasure.<br /> While their stories and music are lighthearted and accessible, the  Victorian events and personalities that infuse the lyrics do need some  explanation, and Ian Bradley s guide is the place to look.<br />The book  itself offers additional pleasure, since Oxford University Press decided to  print the complete libretto of all 13 operas on the right-hand page,  leaving the left-hand pages free for Bradley's footnotes. This saves an  enormous amount of page-flipping.<br />Bradley' footnotes cover a wide range  of knowledge. They clear up obscure references, offer alternative line  readings, give advice from actors, comment on stage business, describe who  the major characters were modeled on and even add songs that were dropped  from the production.<br />Bradley also uses this opportunity to discuss  Gilbert and Sullivan s solo works, and how they were sometimes cannibalized  for use in their collaborations.<br />Each work is prefaced with a short  introduction describing the conditions under which they were created. While  Gilbert and Sullivan were known to be at loggerheads through most of their  collaboration, it is amazing to realize that the popularity of their operas  did not reflect their distate for the work. This is particularly true in  Sullivan s case; he always thought of himself as a musician first, and  resented having to bend his music to fit Gilbert s words.<br />&quot;The  Annotated Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&quot; is a must for any fan of the Savoy  Operas, and recommended for those just starting to discover the delights of  comic opera's pirates, policemen and peers.	2000-08-31
US	52930352	R10NFHI1FUTRSD	0440224071	64914490	Los Alamos	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Life during atomic wartime captivates	Moral ambiguity is the spice to mysteries, and it grow sharpest than at ground zero on a windswept mesa in New Mexico in Joseph Kanon's debut novel  &quot;Los Alamos.&quot;<br />There, working in near-complete secrecy on a  government-built city, scientists led by J. Robert Oppenheimer developed  the atomic bomb. But when the murder of a security officer -- himself a  German refugee like many of the scientists -- with hints of a homosexual  encounter involved, poses a risk to the project. The project chief calls in  Army Intelligence, in the form of Michael Connolly, to investigate, and  possibly to suppress what he finds.<br />The case is tricky in more ways than  one. Connolly must deal with the local police, as well as suspicions that  the murder may be homosexually related, at a time where homophobia was  public policy instead of a private embarrassment.<br />But Kanon shines in  recreating the atmosphere of this city in the clouds, where scientists work  feverishly to unveil the secrets of atomic fission by day, and listen to  Beethoven quartets by night; where its residents can be reached by only a  box number, their driver's licenses identify them by numbers, but as  Connolly observed, &quot;in the most secret place in the world, there was  maid service.&quot; Kanon dives into issues of moral responsibility often,  of the need for secrecy and deceit, but also for the need for love and  trust among people seemingly incapable of both.

It is a land exemplified by  the deep-fried Mars bar: life-threatening but irrisitible in the same way  that one slows down and drives by the accident.<br />&quot;Dead Souls&quot;  picks up Rebus' life in progress, starting with the death of a friend who  launched himself from Salisbury Crag in the middle of the night. He was a  detective with a promising future in the force and a happy family, and  that's enough to engage Rebus' investigative talents.<br />From there  trouble piles on and puts in the boot as well: a two-time murderer is  released from jail in the United States and he decides to settle in  Edinburgh, putting the police in a difficult position: leave him alone and  accept the blame if he murders again, or watch him too closely and be  accused of brutality. The murderous Cary Oakes is a villain worthy of  Hannible Lecter, but without his taste for liver and fava beans. He's  smart, a good actor, manipulative and wholly without a conscious. Against  him, the forces of law and order don't stand much of a chance.<br />In  Rankin's hands, Rebus wanders through many dark nights of the soul,  drinking and eating so badly as to excite the pornographic envy of  Americans too addicted to the idea of healthy living. Although he joins the  ranks of those the grim detectives have followed the bloody trail before  him, Rebus stands out as a fully fleshed being, capable of recognizing his  mistakes and hoping for redemption. &quot;Dead Souls&quot; is a complex  story, but never gets bogged down in the telling, and those with a taste  for exploring the dark side of crime will find that Rankin delivers.	2000-08-31

Browning bring his Anglican heritage to the task, and the result  is entries that should satisfy all but the most orthodox Christians. Those  who believe in the literal accuracy of the Bible will object to Browning's  discussion of the various interpretations of such topics as healing,  miracles, and the authorship of the books. He describes the book of  Revelations, for example, as &quot;an embarrassment to the Church. Its  bizarre imagery has been incomprehensible or misunderstood. Apocalyptic  sects have used it as a handbook to predict the future. Many Christians  have found the apparent gloating over the defeat of the Church's enemies to  be morally repulsive.&quot;<br />But for the most part, Browning did not  intend the dictionary to hew to a particular theology. On topics such as  Jesus' reasoning behind his use of parables, he recaps the major  controversies without showing a bias toward a particular position.<br />&quot;Dictionary of the Bible&quot; is a valuable reference work that  provides an excellent starting point for understanding the meaning of  Christianity. It is clear, concise, and challenging to the intellect.	2000-08-31

We can't  see the value of learning about the past, and applying its lessons to the  present. We're arrogant enough with our vast wealth and power to believe  that we invented everything first. Or we simply don't see the value of  history, as a resource, as object lesson, as holding some answers to  today's dilemmas.<br />Brandeis University professor David Hackett Fischer  acknowledges this blind spot and takes the long view in &quot;The Great  Wave.&quot; Utilizing a very long telescope, one that sees back as far as  the Dark Ages, Fischer investigates the history of price changes to expound  on a fascinating theory that can possibly foretell nothing less than the  future of the United States, whether we're headed for an era of greater  prosperity, or a catastrophe like that of the Great Depression.<br />Fischer's long-view theme is similar to more popular and populist works  that spring up like daffodils and last about as long: Toffler's  &quot;Fourth Wave&quot; and &quot;Future Shock&quot; easily come to mind,  and politicians have their favorite advocates of either the &quot;future's  so bright we got to wear shades&quot; school of eternal optimism, or the  &quot;hunker down, boys, the Japanese / Germans / Latinos / big business /  lower classes are coming over the walls&quot; school.<br />The theory behind  &quot;The Great Wave,&quot; in contrast, is the real thing, backed by solid  research, not the author's political leanings. By examining the prices  people paid for goods throughout history, four &quot;price  revolutions&quot; were identified, each followed by a long period when  prices were relatively stable. The intensity and length of each revolution  was different, lasting as short as 80 years, to as long as 180 years.<br />What provides the kick behind this notion is how this series of rising  and fallings have had on the growth of society. In general, rising prices  placed severe stresses on society at large. During the first three upticks  (during the Medieval, 16th century and 18th century periods), bad weather  added to the troubles by destroying harvests, leading to widespread  starvation. The lower classes, squeezed between prices for basic foods they  could no longer pay, as well as laws passed by the wealthy classes who  wished to protect their investments, lead to catastrophes such as social  revolution or a population-reducing plague. That would restabilize prices  and, in general, give everybody a chance to catch their breath.<br />Once the  shocks of the collapse have passed, the society finds that prices have  stabilized, and the population at large begins to recover. When times are  good, the population tends to increase. This places stresses on food and  fuel, triggering inflation. Continued prosperity increases the cycle of  growth and demand, and added to the troubles are the occasional wars, when  ambitious people felt comfortable enough with the status quo to demand more  of it.<br />This is a simplistic rendering in a review of what is actually a  rather simple theory to understand in practice. Fischer tells the story of  each wave, and the cause-and-effect patterns are so clear that it seems  like one is reading the same story four times, with only the names of the  players changed.<br />Fischer's book looks intimidating at first. Its 536  pages is studded with charts showing the fluctuation of prices throughout  history. But Fischer devotes only 258 pages to an analysis of prices waves;  the rest of the book is taken up with appendices and essays on side issues.  And the 258 pages contains 105 charts, further reducing the amount of  reading needed to grasp the main points.<br />Economics has been called the  dismal science, but Fischer's work offers a cautionary story that is  readily understandable and surprisingly compelling to the general reader.  Where Fischer says we are on the next wave, I'll leave to those willing to  makethe effort. &quot;The Great Wave&quot; is well worth the journey.e willing to  make the effort. &quot;The Great Wave&quot; is well worth the journey.	2000-08-31

Call today!	Archeology is a science in which much work and sweat can be expended for so little return. It's a gambler's profession in which the best guess is  taken from the scant bits of evidence mixed with intuition and blind faith.  If you're right, the rewards can be magnificent: an untouched tomb of an  Egyptian Pharaoh, the bones of someone who died millions of years ago,  perhaps the discovery of a heretofore unknown civilization.<br />&quot;Eyewitness to Discovery&quot; is a wide, but not very deep,  compilation of 55 archeological discoveries, edited by anthropology  professor Brian Fagan. It's an anthology which prizes breadth over depth.  Each account averages only four or five pages, giving a only a tantalizing  taste of the complete story, and hopefully driving the curious to the  bibliography to seek out those works. This schema allows Fagan to cover the  major moments in the field, while drawing attention to lesser-known finds:  a Paleo-Indian bison kill in Colorado, the ruins of an ancient large city  in Zimbabwe, an African cemetery found in Manhattan that provoked a clash  between the groups eager to reclaim their heritage, and the developers with  profit margins to maintain.<br />The classic tales are here as well, and they  serve to remind us of just how well the explorers and scientists of a  previous generation wrote of their finds. Here's Howard Carter's account of  the opening of King Tutankhamun's tomb, at the point where he peered  through a tiny breach into a room that hadn't been seen by human eyes in  several thousand years: &quot;seeing nothing [at first], the hot air  escaping from the chamber caused the candle flame to flicker, but  presently, as my eyes grew accustomed to the light, details of the room  within emerged slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues, and gold --  everywhere the glint of gold. . . . when Lord Carnarvon [who financed  Carter's expeditions], unable to stand the suspense any longer, inquired  anxiously, &quot;Can you see anything?&quot; it was all I could do to get  out the words,  Yes, wonderful things.'&quot;<br />Wonderful things indeed.  Archeologists are popularly portrayed as either adventurers or greed heads,  but some were romantics, driven by their curiosity into far-off lands.  Perhaps it's because they must use their imaginations so much of the time:  to look at a jumble of tottering, vine-covered buildings and see a people  in the midst of their civilization.<br />&quot;In the midst of desolation and  ruin,&quot; John Lloyd Stephens wrote in 1841 about discovering the remains  of the Mayan civilization in Central America, &quot;we looked back to the  past, cleared away the gloomy forest, and fancied every building perfect,  with its terraces and pyramids, it sculptured and painted ornaments, grand,  lofty, and imposing, and overlooking an immense inhabited plain; we called  back into life the strange people who gazed at us in sadness from the  walls; pictured them, in fanciful costumes and adorned with plumes of  feathers, ascending the terraces of the palace and the steps leading to the  temples.&quot;<br />Eight pages of brilliant color photos illustrate  Tutankhamun's gold funerary mask, the mummified body of Ramesses II, the  burial suit made of jade plaques woven together with gold thread, used by a  Chinese noblewoman, and, possibly most affecting, the skeletons of a Roman  family whose house was crushed during the Cyprus earthquake of 365 A.D. But  even though each essay is accompanied by its own illustration or  photograph, it is not enough. These accounts can so fire the imagination  that one wishes for more maps, more diagrams, more pictures; to see  Kathleen Kenyon's Jericho skulls, with their faces rebuilt with clay  &quot;moulded with extraordinary delicacy,&quot; the mysterious tower at  Greater Zimbabwe, built without an entrance, or the 60 ancient Egyptian  warriors, who died during a minor, long-forgotten siege, buried in a tomb  at Thebes.<br />&quot;Eyewitness to Discovery&quot; is a reminder of the  labor and rewards involved in bringing to light our buried past, and is an  ideal book for armchair archeologists.br />&quot;Eyewitness to Discovery&quot; is a reminder of the  labor and rewards involved in bringing to light our buried past, and is an  ideal book for armchair archeologists.	2000-08-31

Rumors fly that Clodius died during a clash with the bodyguards of a rival  politician, and Clodius' allies in response burn the Senate and demand  justice. Amidst the rioting, Gordianus is hired by both the dead man's  family and none other than Pompey the Great to discover the truth.  <br />Saylor takes his time developing his story, which allows the reader to  tour Rome with Gordianus as his guide. We get to walk with bodyguards  streets that take meanness to another level, take part in public forums in  which politicians manipulate the feelings of the masses (no surprise  there), and even travel the countryside to visit Julius Caesar.  <br />&quot;A  Murder on the Appian Way&quot; is based on actual events. The murder of  Clodius, Saylor points out in an appendix, had great ramifications for the  republic. The inability of Rome to deal with the crisis indicated a power  vacuum that both Caesar and Pompey attempted to fill, and the result was a  civil war which aided the transformation of the Roman Republic into the  Roman Empire. But to the reader, the story's the thing, and Saylor's  accomplished mystery is wrapped around an ancient world that, to the  imaginative mind at least, could easily look like home, and that's a worthy  accomplishment for the historical writer.	2000-08-31

In the hall of mirrors that is popular culture, he is the dirty man who wrote the dirty book &quot;Lolita,&quot;  about a 12-year-old &quot;nymphet&quot; -- he invented the term, by the way  -- and her affair with an older man.<br />Angle the mirror another way, and  he is one of the founders of the modernist novel, which to some people --  myself included -- that's a damning phrase. &quot;Modernist&quot; and  &quot;post-modernist&quot; literature seems a) self-referencing to the  point of egotism; b) dedicated to the advancement of decedent themes, and  to score big points as a writer, pile it on, brother; and c) obsessed with  the discovery that the &quot;arts&quot; -- whether books, pictures or  movies -- are artificial, and that we use them to create, well, books,  pictures and movies.<br />Unless you think I am making it up, here's an  example drawn from real life: a few years back, a Charlotte museum mounted  an exhibition of a painter's work, one of which was a canvas whose front  side was turned toward the wall, exposing a paint-stained frame. A  newspaper reviewer breathlessly informed the reading public that the artist  did this &quot;to inform the viewer that most paintings are  recetangular.&quot;<br />Now, a reasonably intelligent person could probably  reach that conclusion without much effort, but discoveries like these seem  to drive those who tread into the &quot;modern&quot; era of art.<br />So  Vlaidmir Nabokov's reputation is caught between two very opposing poles. He  either panders to the worst tastes of man, or the worst tastes of art.<br />Fortunately, he is neither, and the Library of America agrees. The  non-profit publisher throws its reputation behind Nabokov as a writer worth  reading by publishing all of his English-language novels in three volumes.  The first volume covers his work from 1941 to 1951: &quot;The Real Life of  Sebastian Knight,&quot; &quot;Bend Sinister,&quot; and his memoir,  &quot;Speak, Memory.&quot; The middle work contains the notorious  &quot;Lolita,&quot; &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; &quot;Pnin,&quot; and the  &quot;Lolita&quot; screenplay Nabokov wrote for Stanley Kubrick. The  concluding volume contains &quot;Ada,&quot; &quot;Transparent Things,&quot;  and &quot;Look at the Harlequins!&quot;<br />But of these works, only  &quot;Lolita&quot; stands alone. It is not a dirty book, and one should  pity those American and British tourists who, in the mid-1950s, bought the  pale olive-green two-volume paperbacks published in Paris by the notorious  Olympia Press. Those expecting frankly pornographic stories like &quot;The  Story of O&quot; and &quot;How to Do It&quot; would have been sorely  disappointed in Humbert Humbert's self-confessed defense of his rape (not  &quot;seduction,&quot; which implies a willingness to be seduced) and  exploitation of Delores Haze, &quot;Lolita, light of my life,fire of my  loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of  three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee.  Ta.&quot;<br />Even Olympia's publisher was taken in, telling a mutual friend  that he though Nabokov was Humbert, and that he was attempting to  popularize nymphet love.<br />What does become apparent after reading through  the volumes (and aided by an excellent two-volume biography by Brian Boyd)  is that there is much more to Nabokov than meets the eye. Delving deeper in  his works reveals a funhouse hall of mirrors that can lead to a definitive  end, and there's not much in modernist fiction that could substantiate that  claim.<br />What sets Nabokov off from other writers is his use of the  language. Raised in Tsarist Russia, Nabokov was a child prodigy who was  taught Russian, French and English at an early age. His prose is elegent,  his command of English astounding. It's close to the prose of Henry James,  but except for the foreign phrases, which the Library editions  provide  translations and explanations, far more understandable.<br />Descriptions  pulled at random from &quot;Lolita&quot; ring as if English was a newly  minted language, capable of expressing humor (&quot;The bed was a frightful  mess with overtones of potato chips&quot;) and snobbish anger (&quot;Lo had  grabbed some comics from the back seat and, mobile white-bloused, one brown  elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of some clout or  clown&quot;).<br />Even, when Humbert meets his Lolita long after she escaped  his clutches, when he believes that he still loves her, heart-rending:  &quot;In her washed-out grey eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance  was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party,  like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a  humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.&quot;<br />This  is not casual reading, but neither is it reading-as-masochistic exercise,  with furrowed brows and an exasperated flipping of once-read pages. There  is a surface meaning that is easily accessible, but there are deeper  meanings, in-jokes, ironies and moral questions worthy of consideration.<br />The best volume of the three is the second, which contains  &quot;Lolita,&quot; the screenplay he wrote for Stanley Kubrick (which was  not used), the comic novel (for Nabokov at least) &quot;Pnin&quot; and  &quot;Pale Fire.&quot;<br />But good works can be found in the other volumes  as well. &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,&quot; in the first  volume, is the author's account of his biographical research on his  half-brother, the brilliant writer Sebastian Knight, who had died recently  of a heart condition after writing a half-dozen novels. It bears all the  hallmarks of the post-modernist novel replete with a self-absorption with  writers, spurious biography, an unreliable narrator and ironical  references.  &quot;Speak, Memory,&quot; also in the first volume, is  Nabokov's memoirs about growing up in Russia.<br />Indeed, the only  disadvantage to reading Nabokov is that it may cause a nagging niggling in  the back of your head, while reading novels in the future, that they just  cannot compare to those composed by the American from Russia.and explanations, far more understandable. <br />Descriptions  pulled at random from &quot;Lolita&quot; ring as if English was a newly  minted language, capable of expressing humor (&quot;The bed was a frightful  mess with overtones of potato chips&quot;) and snobbish anger (&quot;Lo had  grabbed some comics from the back seat and, mobile white-bloused, one brown  elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of some clout or  clown&quot;). <br />Even, when Humbert meets his Lolita long after she escaped  his clutches, when he believes that he still loves her, heart-rending:  &quot;In her washed-out grey eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance  was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party,  like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a  humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.&quot; <br />This  is not casual reading, but neither is it reading-as-masochistic exercise,  with furrowed brows and an exasperated flipping of once-read pages.

The Campbell brothers emigrate from  Scotland to America. Alexander settled in New York City while James moved  to Charleston. When the war broke out, Alexander enlisted in the 79th New  York &quot;Highlanders&quot; and James in the 1st South Carolina  &quot;Charleston&quot; battalion. Their war service was vastly different:  Alexander fought in Virginia, South Carolina and Kentucky, and resigned in  1863 after being wounded in battle. James helped guard the South Carolina  coast, was captured in the battle of Battery Wagner in July 1863 and spent  the rest of the war in three Northern prisons.<br />Although both brothers  wrote the letters that are collected in this book, they are vastly  dissimilar. The majority of the book consists of Alexander's letters to his  wife, while most of James's letters were from prison, by nature short and  censored. But one from James shortly after the brothers fought in the  battle of Successionville in 1862 laid the position down succinctly:  &quot;I hope that You and I will never again meet face to face Bitter  enemies on the Battle field. But if such should be the case You have but to  discharge your deauty to Your caus for I can assure you I will strive to  discharge my deauty to my country &amp; My cause.&quot; But despite their  beliefs in their respective causes, Alexander and James were brothers, and  their feelings for each other, as reflected in the letters and Alexander's  assistance to James while he was in prison, never changed. They were  brothers first.<br />Also included in &quot;Him on the One Side&quot; is an  extensive collection of footnotes, explanatory material and maps.	2000-08-31

Expertly written and plotted, they have nothing more on  their mind than entertaining you.<br />&quot;Half the Truth&quot; is just  such a book. Chicago private detective Malachy Foley is a '90s kind of  p.i.: hard-boiled but sensitive. He's got a knack for finding trouble, a  desire to help and an ex-wife he would like to win back.<br />In this  follow-up to David Walker's Edgar-nominated debut &quot;Fixed in His  Folly,&quot; Foley must find a college basketball player who went missing  shortly after his roommate was drowned while apparently attempting to cross  Lake Michigan in his sports car. As his search takes him from downtown  Chicago to a Wisconsin military school, Foley encounters several  pacifist-challenged men who have the same idea, and the case turns  threatening when his client and ex-wife are kidnaped and held for ransom.<br />&quot;Half the Truth&quot; is a cat-and-mouse game with high stakes,  punctuated by tense encounters that threaten to explode at any time.  Sometimes, they do.<br />Walker's sequel was fun to read. Foley's strong  desire to see justice done -- a trait common in mystery p.i.'s -- is  tempered with unconventional ways of attracting attention from those who  don't want to see him, whether tearing up one thug's fake parking ticket or  doing exercises in a lawyer's high-toned reception room. If Bill Murray  could adopt Foley's mournful demeanor, he'd fit this Second City p.i.'s  M.O. to a tee.	2000-08-31

He's in a job he hates,  he's married to a woman who hates him, and he's stressed because his infant  son has kept him from a night's sleep for the last 20 weeks.<br />This is the  land settled by John Cheever and John Updike, but their protagonists never  dealt with their defeats and disappointments the way Ben Bradford does.  When he discovers that his wife is having an affair with the ne'er-do-well  photographer down the street, Ben flips out and smashes the cur's head in  with an especially fine New Zealand sauvignon blanc. Then, imaging a future  featuring a divorce, no job and a long stretch in the pen, he cuts and  runs. Lost in suburbia one moment, he plans his escape with a cunning and  intelligence as if he's Tom Cruise of the Impossible Mission Force. He  freezes his rival's body, takes a Black &amp; Decker circular saw to him,  smuggles the pieces on board a borrowed yacht, and blows it up at sea using  a recipe from The Anarchist's Cookbook culled off the Internet. Pausing  just long enough to borrow the man's identity, he lights out for the  frontier, in this case, a small town in Montana that's been infected with  what the locals call &quot;Californication,&quot; where the new arrivals  from the West Coast bring their money, their coffeehouses and art  galleries, and their propensity for buying up all the land in sight. There,  while living off the murdered man's trust fund, he builds on his borrowed  identity and attempts to live his dream of being a photographer.<br />The  opening chapters are especially tough sledding, since Kennedy piles on Ben  every possible source of angst -- the bitching wife, the screaming kid at 2  a.m. with diarrhea leaking out his diapers, the memories of the youthful  lover who achieved her dream of becoming a foreign correspondent, while hebecame just another lawyer who takes pictures for fun -- in an attempt to  win our sympathy. But Ben is so wealthy, has so many possessions and is  such a wimp that it's impossible to feel sympathy for him.<br />It also  doesn't help that Ben is a self-obsessive jerk who abandons his children  (but he feels sorry for them), twice murders (all right, the second time  was really an accident, but it's so coincidental that he should get charged  with it anyway), lies and steals. And we're supposed to admire him for it?  I don't think so.<br />Kennedy wants us to think about how we live the life  we have, rather than the life we want. The trouble is that this contradicts  the story. Examining issues of escape and life are themes best suited for  literary novels, not for books where the proper application of explosives  helps a man follow his bliss. This contradiction turns &quot;The Big  Picture&quot; into an intellectual masquerade, a jumped-up penny-dreadful  wrapped in &quot;profound issues&quot; intended to make the reader feel  like he's gaining a measure of insight, and not just being (heaven forbid!)  entertained. If you can get past Ben Bradford's toxic whining, you'll find  underneath a fast-moving, sometimes tense story, that does for  wish-fulfilling males what &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; did  for romance-starved females. Give Virginia Woolf a room of her own; I want  a circular saw.became just another lawyer who takes pictures for fun -- in an attempt to  win our sympathy.

Sounds like  &quot;Star Trek&quot; to me. But television producer and writer Lee  Goldberg has taken that story, thrown in seriously twisted agents, actors  and sci-fi fans, hit the frappe button, and spun out &quot;Beyond the  Beyond,&quot; an over-the-top melange of ultra-violence, sick humor and  black comedy.<br />Everyone wears a target in &quot;Beyond the Beyond.&quot;  Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock are mutated into the Endeavor's Captain Pierce  and Mr. Snork, whose fans emulate the latter character's elephant nose.  There's a network boss who creates shows like &quot;Siamese Cops&quot;  about a police officer with two heads, and a superagent who uses any tactic  to keep his talent under contract.<br />So when &quot;Beyond the Beyond&quot;  is revived for The Big Network, it lets loose a tractor-trailer load of  nuts and flakes, especially when the actor who played Captain Pierce, Guy  Goddard, attempts to reclaim his role, aided by a group of equally demented  fans.<br />As the body count rises into the stratosphere, it is up to studio  security agent Charlie Willis to sort out the problems. Willis is more than  up to the job, and comes across as sane (he's only one of two characters  with any redeeming qualities) and realistic enough about Hollywood to keep  his other job as owner/manager of a storage facility.<br />So whether you  would enjoy &quot;Beyond the Beyond&quot; depends entirely on your taste  for humor that knows no boundaries for taste. This is a book that should  come with an advisory for mature readers. It's Mel Brooks with a laser  blaster. Its humor is so wide-ranging and so scattershot that there's  something to offend every reader, especially those who take &quot;Star  Trek&quot; and its ilk seriously.t;Star  Trek&quot; and its ilk seriously.	2000-08-31

There are &quot;Companions&quot; to  American literature and English literature, the gossipy and Brit-biased  &quot;Reader's Guide to Twentieth Century Writers,&quot; and now this prose  atlas to the century's notable writers in English. It is, in a literary  way, an embarrassment of riches.<br />Describing this extensive overview of  everything worth noting about 20th century literature in English can be  compared to the blind men describing an elephant. So much to cover, so many  varieties of prose, and so little space to describe it all.<br />The giants  are here, and if greatness is measured by the space allotted to them, then  D.H.Lawrence leads, with two full pages dedicated to his achievements,  followed by James Joyce, T.S. Eliot and Joseph Conrad (11/2 pages), Henry  James (11/4 pages), and Graham Greene, William Faulkner and W.B. Yeats with  one page.<br />At the other end of the fiction scale, where bestsellers  reign, can be more problematic, with some authors worthy of inclusion (John  Grisham, Scott Turow, Stephen King, a lonely line next to Barbara  Cartland's name that refers the reader to the &quot;romantic fiction&quot;  section) and others not (Michael Crichton, John Jakes, Danielle Steel).  Genre writers tend to stand a better chance of inclusion, such as Georgette  Heyer (romance), Jack Vance, Ursula K. LeGuin and Michael Moorcock  (fantasy), J.G. Ballard, James Tiptree and Robert Heinlein  (science-fiction), and Sara Paretsky, Tony Hillerman and John Mortimer  (mystery).<br />Editor Jenny Stringer also went out of her way to include  notable persons outside of literature -- The Beatles, Harvey Fierstein,  Hunter Thompson, Tony Kushner and Theodore Veblen are in here -- as well as  institutions, magazines and literary movements. Identifying these movements  can sometimes be an exercise in deciphering obscure meanings. The entry on  Modernism, for example, defines clearly its practitioners. Their works,  however, &quot;indicate the breach with the conventions of rational  exposition and stylistic decorum in the immediate post-war period.&quot;  Nowhere is there a phrase as clear as (and this is taken from an upcoming  Oxford reference on James Joyce): &quot;[Literary modernism] interrogates  the legitimacy of traditional social institutions such as the family, the  church and the state, rejecting their authority to prescribe and enforce  moral standards of behavior.&quot;<br /><br />Apart from that caveat, this Oxford  Companion is a worthwhile aid through 20th century literature. Which one  that is right for you depends entirely on where your taste in literature  lies. It is only safe to say that there isn't a better guide anywhere.odernism, for example, defines clearly its practitioners.

By the end, one of  their novels will hit the top of the New York Times Best Seller list. Which  will it be?<br />* Will it be Gerald Ochs Davis, the president of Davis &amp;  Dash? He s hoping that resurrecting an uncle's tragedy decades ago will  make enough money to keep his mistress and ex-wives satisfied, and himself  at the head of the now corporately owned company. To that end, he'll do  anything&quot; order an expensive ad budget, set an impossibly high quota  for the sales force and even steal sales from other authors.<br />* Then  there's Susann Baker Edmonds, formerly Sue Ann Edmonds, a legal secretary  from the Midwest, who at 58 is facing the end of her career. She is also  beset by her daughter, who bitterly resents her mother.<br />* The college  professor author of &quot;In Full Knowledge,&quot; a thriller about a woman  driven to kill her children, is being heavily promoted as a man who  understands women. Little do they know that his wife actually wrote the  book, a fact which her husband is not eager to make known.<br />* Poor Terry  O'Neal. She kills herself after writing a 1,000-page novel called &quot;The  Duplicity of Men,&quot; after seeing it rejected by 23 publishers. Now the  manuscript falls into the hands of her mother, Opal, who is determined to  do anything to see it published.<br />* Camilla Clapfish is the dowdy,  terribly lonely British girl, working as a tour guide in Italy, while  finishing her first novel about a group of middle-aged women wandering  around Firenze. As a neophyte writer, she has no idea what to do next,  until her budding boyfriend suggests sending it to his sister, an editorial  assistant at Davis &amp; Dash.<br />From this premise, Goldsmith weaves an  elaborate dance of backstabbing, determination, desire and romance that is  guaranteed to have you turning the pages late into the night.<br />Those who  have a smattering of knowledge of the publishing business will realize just  how spot-on Goldsmith is. She knows the bottom-line nature of the business  and the lengths people will go to stay on top. There is even the pleasure  of guessing who the characters are based on.<br />For example, one of the  subplots involves the uproar over Davis &amp; Dash publishing  &quot;ScitzoBoy,&quot; by Chad Weston, a once-promising writer driven by  falling sales into writing a misogynistic thriller about a Wall Street  yuppie who dismembers women, and if you're thinking it's a wicked attack on  Bret Easton Ellis and &quot;American Psycho,&quot; you are correct.<br />&quot;The Bestseller&quot; is full of digs like this. With that, the  heroic struggles of the authors to get their books published, and the  machinations of G.O.D. and the marketplace working against them, &quot;The  Bestseller&quot; is a candy box of surprises that, even after 500 pages,  makes this reader hungry for a sequel.e and romance that is  guaranteed to have you turning the pages late into the night.  <br />Those who  have a smattering of knowledge of the publishing business will realize just  how spot-on Goldsmith is.

Since he's dealing with his betters in class-conscious Victorian Britain,  Pitt must tread carefully as he delves into the dead man's past in hopes of  finding a connection.<br />&quot;Bedford Square&quot; is a story which  promises much but delivers little. There's much talk about class  differences -- Pitt's constable assistant is nearly blinded in his anger  against the upper classes -- and in Pitt's investigation of what turns out  to be a nasty wide-ranging blackmail plot, we are repeatedly told that the  victims are all pure in character and how least revelation, no matter how  false, will blast their reputations so utterly that it becomes tedious. The  solution to the mystery is extremely disappointing: neither making much  sense, nor is it in keeping with what we know of the characters. A  disappointing book to someone who wondered what all the shouting was about.	2000-08-31

In the hall of mirrors that is popular culture, he is the dirty man who wrote the dirty book &quot;Lolita,&quot;  about a 12-year-old &quot;nymphet&quot; -- he invented the term, by the way  -- and her affair with an older man.<br />Angle the mirror another way, and  he is one of the founders of the modernist novel, which to some people --  myself included -- that's a damning phrase. &quot;Modernist&quot; and  &quot;post-modernist&quot; literature seems a) self-referencing to the  point of egotism; b) dedicated to the advancement of decedent themes, and  to score big points as a writer, pile it on, brother; and c) obsessed with  the discovery that the &quot;arts&quot; -- whether books, pictures or  movies -- are artificial, and that we use them to create, well, books,  pictures and movies.<br />Unless you think I am making it up, here's an  example drawn from real life: a few years back, a Charlotte museum mounted  an exhibition of a painter's work, one of which was a canvas whose front  side was turned toward the wall, exposing a paint-stained frame. A  newspaper reviewer breathlessly informed the reading public that the artist  did this &quot;to inform the viewer that most paintings are  recetangular.&quot;<br />Now, a reasonably intelligent person could probably  reach that conclusion without much effort, but discoveries like these seem  to drive those who tread into the &quot;modern&quot; era of art.<br />So  Vlaidmir Nabokov's reputation is caught between two very opposing poles. He  either panders to the worst tastes of man, or the worst tastes of art.<br />Fortunately, he is neither, and the Library of America agrees. The  non-profit publisher throws its reputation behind Nabokov as a writer worth  reading by publishing all of his English-language novels in three volumes.  The first volume covers his work from 1941 to 1951: &quot;The Real Life of  Sebastian Knight,&quot; &quot;Bend Sinister,&quot; and his memoir,  &quot;Speak, Memory.&quot; The middle work contains the notorious  &quot;Lolita,&quot; &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; &quot;Pnin,&quot; and the  &quot;Lolita&quot; screenplay Nabokov wrote for Stanley Kubrick. The  concluding volume contains &quot;Ada,&quot; &quot;Transparent Things,&quot;  and &quot;Look at the Harlequins!&quot;<br />But of these works, only  &quot;Lolita&quot; stands alone. It is not a dirty book, and one should  pity those American and British tourists who, in the mid-1950s, bought the  pale olive-green two-volume paperbacks published in Paris by the notorious  Olympia Press. Those expecting frankly pornographic stories like &quot;The  Story of O&quot; and &quot;How to Do It&quot; would have been sorely  disappointed in Humbert Humbert's self-confessed defense of his rape (not  &quot;seduction,&quot; which implies a willingness to be seduced) and  exploitation of Delores Haze, &quot;Lolita, light of my life,fire of my  loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of  three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee.  Ta.&quot;<br />Even Olympia's publisher was taken in, telling a mutual friend  that he though Nabokov was Humbert, and that he was attempting to  popularize nymphet love.<br />What does become apparent after reading through  the volumes (and aided by an excellent two-volume biography by Brian Boyd)  is that there is much more to Nabokov than meets the eye. Delving deeper in  his works reveals a funhouse hall of mirrors that can lead to a definitive  end, and there's not much in modernist fiction that could substantiate that  claim.<br />What sets Nabokov off from other writers is his use of the  language. Raised in Tsarist Russia, Nabokov was a child prodigy who was  taught Russian, French and English at an early age. His prose is elegent,  his command of English astounding. It's close to the prose of Henry James,  but except for the foreign phrases, which the Library editions  provide  translations and explanations, far more understandable.<br />Descriptions  pulled at random from &quot;Lolita&quot; ring as if English was a newly  minted language, capable of expressing humor (&quot;The bed was a frightful  mess with overtones of potato chips&quot;) and snobbish anger (&quot;Lo had  grabbed some comics from the back seat and, mobile white-bloused, one brown  elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of some clout or  clown&quot;).<br />Even, when Humbert meets his Lolita long after she escaped  his clutches, when he believes that he still loves her, heart-rending:  &quot;In her washed-out grey eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance  was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party,  like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a  humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.&quot;<br />This  is not casual reading, but neither is it reading-as-masochistic exercise,  with furrowed brows and an exasperated flipping of once-read pages. There  is a surface meaning that is easily accessible, but there are deeper  meanings, in-jokes, ironies and moral questions worthy of consideration.<br />The best volume of the three is the second, which contains  &quot;Lolita,&quot; the screenplay he wrote for Stanley Kubrick (which was  not used), the comic novel (for Nabokov at least) &quot;Pnin&quot; and  &quot;Pale Fire.&quot;<br />But good works can be found in the other volumes  as well. &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,&quot; in the first  volume, is the author's account of his biographical research on his  half-brother, the brilliant writer Sebastian Knight, who had died recently  of a heart condition after writing a half-dozen novels. It bears all the  hallmarks of the post-modernist novel replete with a self-absorption with  writers, spurious biography, an unreliable narrator and ironical  references.  &quot;Speak, Memory,&quot; also in the first volume, is  Nabokov's memoirs about growing up in Russia.<br />Indeed, the only  disadvantage to reading Nabokov is that it may cause a nagging niggling in  the back of your head, while reading novels in the future, that they just  cannot compare to those composed by the American from Russia.and explanations, far more understandable. <br />Descriptions  pulled at random from &quot;Lolita&quot; ring as if English was a newly  minted language, capable of expressing humor (&quot;The bed was a frightful  mess with overtones of potato chips&quot;) and snobbish anger (&quot;Lo had  grabbed some comics from the back seat and, mobile white-bloused, one brown  elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of some clout or  clown&quot;). <br />Even, when Humbert meets his Lolita long after she escaped  his clutches, when he believes that he still loves her, heart-rending:  &quot;In her washed-out grey eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance  was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party,  like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a  humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.&quot; <br />This  is not casual reading, but neither is it reading-as-masochistic exercise,  with furrowed brows and an exasperated flipping of once-read pages.

Elvis, the Beatles and Marilyn Monroe have received the A to Z treatment  in which every aspect of their lives and works have been reordered  alphabetically, so it was only a matter of time that the mania would spread  to lesser figures, in this case Mark Twain, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf.  This series of three books, originally published by Facts On File and now  updated and reprinted by Oxford University Press, combines facts culled  from the writers' lives and works, shakes them up thoroughly, and recasts  them into easily locatable entries. The result is an addictive pleasure, a  page-turning odyessy for anyone interested in learning more about their  favorite writer.  Mark Twain's fans will rightfully go ga-ga over this  500-page slab of scholarship, research and story telling. All of Twain's  major works are discussed, as well as many of his short stories, speeches,  newspaper articles, essays and unpublished works. Photos of the great man  himself and his contemporaries are thrown in alongside illustrations from  the novels. A year-by-year multi-columned chronology charts Twain's  personal, professional and public lives. In short, the breadth and depth of  this book is astonishing.	2000-08-31

The stories that Marion Chesney write -- the romances under this name and the mysteries penned under the name M.C. Beaton -- are always at their  best when they bust out of their prefab genres or confound our expectations  of her characters. At times, her books are almost subversive. Her Poor  Relations series, set in the Regency era, casts a glance at convention by  telling a love story, but it's clear that she's interested in her secondary  characters as well, and the result is a charming, entertaining series of  books that stand out from the herd.<br />She has a similar success with this  mystery series starring Hamish Macbeth, the constable of a small Scottish  seaside town. Depending upon the book, this series, now numbering 15 books,  is a cross-fertilization of police procedural, village cozy and romance,  all held together by the amiable Macbeth, the good copper too unambitious  to want to move from Lochdubh, no matter how irritating the cantankerous  residents could be at times.<br /><br />But &quot;Death of an Addict&quot; sends  Macbeth away from Lochdubh as he investigates the suspicious drug overdose  of a young man who had kicked heroin and was writing a book about his  experiences. The trail leads to an evangelical church of dubious faith and  to drug smuggling in Amsterdam, where Macbeth falls into some very  unofficer-like behavior as he goes undercover as a smuggler alongside a  hard-nosed detective inspector who poses as his wife.<br />While I've  generally found the Macbeth stories a treat, &quot;Death of an Addict&quot;  is a cut above Beaton's usual excellence. With its fast pace, a plot that  takes unexpected turns and Macbeth pushed into some unexpected roles,  &quot;Addict&quot; is the best book of the series, and it brings joy to  this reader's heart to know that there are more books to come.	2000-08-31

Elvis, the Beatles and Marilyn Monroe have received the A to Z  treatment in which every aspect of their lives and works have been  reordered alphabetically, so it was only a matter of time that the mania  would spread to lesser figures in our popular culture, in this case Mark  Twain, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf.<br />This series of three books,  originally published by Facts On File and now updated and reprinted by  Oxford University Press, combines facts culled from the writers' lives and  works, shakes them up thoroughly, and recasts them into easily locatable  entries. The result is an addictive pleasure, a page-turning odyessy for  anyone interested in learning more about their favorite writer.<br />At 304  pages, the Joyce volume is the smallest of the trio, but what it lacks in  size it more than makes up by offering extensive commentaries on  &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot; Those who have tried to  read these modernist (or post-modernist, the argument still rages) classics  have quickly recognized the need for assistance. For &quot;Ulysses,&quot;  the Joyce volume reprints Joyce's chart that lists each chapter's time  frame, location, symbols, technics, organs, art and correspondences to the  original. Each chapter is given its own entry, which describes the action,  Joyce's intentions, and clairifies points of Dublin's history. As one who  attempted &quot;Ulysses&quot; solo, and suffered for his sin, I can speak  with authority that this volume would have saved me a great deal of agony.  I only wish they had abandoned their schema and combined the chapter  descriptions into a single, lengthy appendix.<br />No detail is too small to  escape the editors. There are also entries on Gustave Flaubert, an  influence on Joyce's writing style; Throwaway, the race horse whose victory  in the Ascot Gold Cup figures in &quot;Ulysses,&quot; and the Volta Cinema,  Dublin's first movie theater, which Joyce helped to open.<br />In short,  this guide can help the Joyce reader move through the complexities of his  work without feeling like you've earned a Ph.D in comparative literature  while you're doing so.this guide can help the Joyce reader move through the complexities of his  work without feeling like you've earned a Ph.D in comparative literature  while you're doing so.	2000-08-31

In the hall of mirrors that is popular culture, he is the dirty man who wrote the dirty book &quot;Lolita,&quot;  about a 12-year-old &quot;nymphet&quot; -- he invented the term, by the way  -- and her affair with an older man.<br />Angle the mirror another way, and  he is one of the founders of the modernist novel, which to some people --  myself included -- that's a damning phrase. &quot;Modernist&quot; and  &quot;post-modernist&quot; literature seems a) self-referencing to the  point of egotism; b) dedicated to the advancement of decedent themes, and  to score big points as a writer, pile it on, brother; and c) obsessed with  the discovery that the &quot;arts&quot; -- whether books, pictures or  movies -- are artificial, and that we use them to create, well, books,  pictures and movies.<br />Unless you think I am making it up, here's an  example drawn from real life: a few years back, a Charlotte museum mounted  an exhibition of a painter's work, one of which was a canvas whose front  side was turned toward the wall, exposing a paint-stained frame. A  newspaper reviewer breathlessly informed the reading public that the artist  did this &quot;to inform the viewer that most paintings are  recetangular.&quot;<br />Now, a reasonably intelligent person could probably  reach that conclusion without much effort, but discoveries like these seem  to drive those who tread into the &quot;modern&quot; era of art.<br />So  Vlaidmir Nabokov's reputation is caught between two very opposing poles. He  either panders to the worst tastes of man, or the worst tastes of art.<br />Fortunately, he is neither, and the Library of America agrees. The  non-profit publisher throws its reputation behind Nabokov as a writer worth  reading by publishing all of his English-language novels in three volumes.  The first volume covers his work from 1941 to 1951: &quot;The Real Life of  Sebastian Knight,&quot; &quot;Bend Sinister,&quot; and his memoir,  &quot;Speak, Memory.&quot; The middle work contains the notorious  &quot;Lolita,&quot; &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; &quot;Pnin,&quot; and the  &quot;Lolita&quot; screenplay Nabokov wrote for Stanley Kubrick. The  concluding volume contains &quot;Ada,&quot; &quot;Transparent Things,&quot;  and &quot;Look at the Harlequins!&quot;<br />But of these works, only  &quot;Lolita&quot; stands alone. It is not a dirty book, and one should  pity those American and British tourists who, in the mid-1950s, bought the  pale olive-green two-volume paperbacks published in Paris by the notorious  Olympia Press. Those expecting frankly pornographic stories like &quot;The  Story of O&quot; and &quot;How to Do It&quot; would have been sorely  disappointed in Humbert Humbert's self-confessed defense of his rape (not  &quot;seduction,&quot; which implies a willingness to be seduced) and  exploitation of Delores Haze, &quot;Lolita, light of my life,fire of my  loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of  three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee.  Ta.&quot;<br />Even Olympia's publisher was taken in, telling a mutual friend  that he though Nabokov was Humbert, and that he was attempting to  popularize nymphet love.<br />What does become apparent after reading through  the volumes (and aided by an excellent two-volume biography by Brian Boyd)  is that there is much more to Nabokov than meets the eye. Delving deeper in  his works reveals a funhouse hall of mirrors that can lead to a definitive  end, and there's not much in modernist fiction that could substantiate that  claim.<br />What sets Nabokov off from other writers is his use of the  language. Raised in Tsarist Russia, Nabokov was a child prodigy who was  taught Russian, French and English at an early age. His prose is elegent,  his command of English astounding. It's close to the prose of Henry James,  but except for the foreign phrases, which the Library editions  provide  translations and explanations, far more understandable.<br />Descriptions  pulled at random from &quot;Lolita&quot; ring as if English was a newly  minted language, capable of expressing humor (&quot;The bed was a frightful  mess with overtones of potato chips&quot;) and snobbish anger (&quot;Lo had  grabbed some comics from the back seat and, mobile white-bloused, one brown  elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of some clout or  clown&quot;).<br />Even, when Humbert meets his Lolita long after she escaped  his clutches, when he believes that he still loves her, heart-rending:  &quot;In her washed-out grey eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance  was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party,  like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a  humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.&quot;<br />This  is not casual reading, but neither is it reading-as-masochistic exercise,  with furrowed brows and an exasperated flipping of once-read pages. There  is a surface meaning that is easily accessible, but there are deeper  meanings, in-jokes, ironies and moral questions worthy of consideration.<br />The best volume of the three is the second, which contains  &quot;Lolita,&quot; the screenplay he wrote for Stanley Kubrick (which was  not used), the comic novel (for Nabokov at least) &quot;Pnin&quot; and  &quot;Pale Fire.&quot;<br />But good works can be found in the other volumes  as well. &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,&quot; in the first  volume, is the author's account of his biographical research on his  half-brother, the brilliant writer Sebastian Knight, who had died recently  of a heart condition after writing a half-dozen novels. It bears all the  hallmarks of the post-modernist novel replete with a self-absorption with  writers, spurious biography, an unreliable narrator and ironical  references.  &quot;Speak, Memory,&quot; also in the first volume, is  Nabokov's memoirs about growing up in Russia.<br />Indeed, the only  disadvantage to reading Nabokov is that it may cause a nagging niggling in  the back of your head, while reading novels in the future, that they just  cannot compare to those composed by the American from Russia.and explanations, far more understandable. <br />Descriptions  pulled at random from &quot;Lolita&quot; ring as if English was a newly  minted language, capable of expressing humor (&quot;The bed was a frightful  mess with overtones of potato chips&quot;) and snobbish anger (&quot;Lo had  grabbed some comics from the back seat and, mobile white-bloused, one brown  elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of some clout or  clown&quot;). <br />Even, when Humbert meets his Lolita long after she escaped  his clutches, when he believes that he still loves her, heart-rending:  &quot;In her washed-out grey eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance  was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party,  like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a  humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.&quot; <br />This  is not casual reading, but neither is it reading-as-masochistic exercise,  with furrowed brows and an exasperated flipping of once-read pages.

That's hard to believe, but it's a sad truth and maybe at the heart of the  man who traveled the country for over 30 years, chronicalling what he saw  and felt in his &quot;On the Road&quot; series for CBS News.<br /> By that  time he graduated college, Kuralt had a work record that would be the envy  of a college journalism graduate. As recounted in &quot;Remembering Charles  Kuralt,&quot; a collection of interviews and essays edited by Ralph  Grizzle, the high school senior had worked for a radio station, helping to  call the baseball games of the Charlotte Hornet. The summer he was 13, he  had a once-a-week radio show. He had won an essay contest on democracy and  delivered his speech in the House of Burgesses in Colonial Williamsburg.<br /> Kuralt knew what he wanted to be a reporter early in his life, and he  pursued it with a single-minded determination. But not only that, he did it  on his work ethic and talent alone, and in a good-natured manner that came  through in his television appearances. &quot;I never heard Charles say  anything unkind about anybody,&quot; jazz pianist and friend Loonis  McGlohon said, &quot;that's true, and in thinking about it, it's pretty  unusual.&quot;<br /> &quot;Remembering Charles Kuralt&quot; covers the whole  of his life and career: his upbringing in eastern North Carolina, his  growth as a writer and reporter, his career at CBSNews, and his life in  retirement, his illness, decline and death. It's an affectionate look that  reveals more about the man than Kuralt probably would have wanted.	2000-08-30

World War II has just started and the first hints of change to their  quiet life have started to appear: blackouts, army mobilization, and those  older men left behind wondering how they can get into the war before its  over. When the hated local squire is found dead in the corner after a night  of drinking, an alert doctor discovers he had been injected with nicotine,  and Scotland Yard inspector Guy Northeast is called in to investigate. The  plotting is intricate and fair in the Golden Age tradition. But  &quot;Death&quot; is only 156 pages long, which means there's not an ounce  of fat on the story, but also no room for a depth of characterization and  viewpoint that powers Sayers and Christie's works. But Cannan slowly builds  interest in Northeast, and he becomes a compelling character. After the  mystery is solved, it's not so much the story we remember, but the  yearning, sad figure of Inspector Northeast. One would like to know what  became of him.	1999-05-21

Was the killing  an attempt to keep the shogun from begetting an heir? Will someone use the  crime as a pretext for getting a rival out of the way?<br /> Sano has  good reason to be doubly concerned about the case: failure to find the  culprit could mean a visit to the execution ground for himself, his  assistant and his family.<br /> Sano is also distracted by his bride, who  is as spirited and unconventional as a 17th-century Katharine Hepburn.  Their journey toward accommodation and compromise form a major part of the  book.<br /> One word of warning: many forms of copulation show up in \\"The  Concubine's Tattoo,\\" and its explicitness may prove unsettling to regular  readers of the genre.	1999-02-04

Open the book at random, and there is something worth reading: George  Templeton Strong wondering in his diary: \\"Is it the doom of all men in this  century to be weighed down with the incumbrance of a desire to make money  and save money, all their days?\\" (in 1852!); Stephen Crane writing of a  man's moral dilemma over the false arrest of a possible prostitute; Ralph  Ellison noting in \\"New York, 1936\\" that: \\"in the hustle and bustle of that  most theatrical of American cities, one was accepted on the basis of what  one appeared to be.\\"<br /> Then there's the fiction and the  anthropological excerpts which offer pleasures of their own. One of Damon  Runyon's stories about the \\"Guys and Dolls\\" of Broadway is here, a tougher  story than one would expect from him. A selection from Oscar Hijuelos' \\"The  Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love\\" is here as well. Joseph Mitchell's \\"Up in  the Old Hotel,\\" an observation piece written for The New Yorker and Zora  Neale Hurston's \\"Story in Harlem Slang.\\"<br /> \\"Writing New York\\" is a  convivial convention, probably the only gathering of New York wits and  writers and reporters we're likely to see this side of heaven.

Mr. Bartholomew Hoare is permanently in that state at the beginning of \\"Hoare and the Portsmouth Atrocities,\\" when a spent musket  ball took away his voice, and an officer incapable of shouting orders is of  no use to the Royal Navy.  So the naval lieutenant is given work as an  assistant to the port admiral of Portsmouth. Hoare has few compensations  for his lonely life. His reduced responsibilities may introduce a  discordant note to the reader. We have here a maritime mystery that never  sails beyond sight of England.  \\"Hoare\\" wends its way through the  story like a ship sailing amid contrary winds, as the lieutenant encounters  a woman being set upon by two ruffians on a beach, a mysterious clockwork  device found in a small barrel on shore, and at one point investigates the  murder of a captain on board his own ship.  There's quite a lot  happening, and author Wilder Perkins crams into little more than 200 pages  no less that three possible life-changing events for Mr. Hoare. The story  adheres close to the conventions of the mystery genre, especially at the  climax, and it seems that the operations of the conspiracy at the heart of  the matter is too complex for its own good. But Perkins has a fine grasp of  the Napoleonic era, with its jolly tars, its devotion to a just cause and  its officers at home more on board their quarterdeck than on land. One only  wishes that Perkins gave us more time to enjoy the experience.	1999-02-04

The fact that we use it as a standard of measurement indicates how we feel about the city. We compare our art, our politics and  the sizes of our cities to it. We sneer at it. We tell jokes about it.  Glance at a map, and its place names (Coney Island! Brighton Beach!  Bedford-Stuyvesant!) pop out, impressed on our collective memory from  movies, plays, literature, television shows. America belongs to New York  City and we're just paying rent.<br /> Two books go a long way toward  showing how it got that way: \\"Gotham\\" is a massive yet readable history of  the city, while \\"Writing New York\\" From the Library of America makes an  amiable companion with its collection of stories and memoirs.<br />  \\"Gotham\\" takes 1,350 pages to tell its story, starting with the Lenape  Indians roaming the fertile lands and closing at the end of the 19th  century when the five boroughs voted to bind themselves together.

It was, after all, a half-century ago, before computers, television, the Interstate Highway  system and couple of major wars.<br /> Which is why following Carl Wilcox,  part-time bum, former convict and itinerant sign painter as he travels from  town to town in the Dakotas so fascinating. In addition to painting signs  and doing what he can to bring body and soul a little closer together, he  sometimes investigate cases in small towns like Hope, Jonesville and  Greenhill.<br /> For the most part, these are pretty quiet stories about  small towns where there's not much to do, and where murders are few and far  between.  Adams's books describe a Depression-era Dakotas of quiet  small towns where private reputations and public behavior mattered. His  Wilcox is a quiet man, willing to work when he needs money and loaf when he  doesn't. His constant pursuit of any semi-willing women would be  off-putting were it not realistically depicted (i.e., he doesn't succeed  very often).<br />  One added bonus can be found in the design of the  books, whose covers sport art by Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton.

Enter Rachel Alexander, the private  eye, who, with her faithful pit bull sidekick, Dashiell, is asked to  provide security during  a week-long dog training symposium at a posh New  York City hotel in &quot;A Hell of a Dog.&quot;  A former dog trainer  herself, Alexander knew the participants, each of whom believed that their  philosophy, whether involving the use of prompt and frequent rewards,  punishments or reading the pooch's psychic aura, will make them the next  Barbara Wodehouse. Her job is complicated by the presence of a now ex-lover  who decided to go back to his wife.  &quot;A Hell of a Dog&quot; earns  its best of show ribbon on several levels. The mystery is suitably  mystifying, Alexander is an intelligent heroine with a heart, and the dog  handlers are an entertaining pack of purebreeds and mutts. Watching them  snapping and snarling at each other is only one of the book's pleasures.  Benjamin writes knowledgeably about the dog world and the handlers'  discussions and arguments about training are enlightening without being  intrusive.	1999-01-06

Author Lindsey Davis dedicates this book to the late writer Edith Pargeter, who as Ellis Peters created the Brother Cadfael series. Davis has been compared as the next Peters, but that is about as fair as calling Dorothy Sayers another Agatha Christie. Both are good writers, but their novels  work in different ways. Davis' novels travel a wider piece of ground than the monk's abbey, and her stories are far more varied.  Also, what sets Falco apart from his hard-boiled rivals is that he shows great sense about power politics behind the Roman Empire. He may be fooled at times, but he's no fool and rightfully suspicious of everyone's motives, and he toes that line without falling into the despair of cynicism where one concludes that since men and women are capable of venial behavior, then all men and women are venal.  He is also capably aided by his high-born wife, Helena Justica, who is also a model of good sense. Their relationship is comfortably complex, and this series is a wonderful ground-zero introduction into life and death during the Roman Empire.	1998-02-11

More than just a reference work describing the doings of politicians and generals. This companion carefully moves into areas not normally covered by such works. There are entries that discuss various major industries - shipbuilding, mining, gas and cotton - and on aspects of private and domestic life, like childbirth, housing, health and food. While the growth, meaning and importance of sports is discussed, only two athletes rate their own entries (the soccer star Stanley Matthews, knighted for his accomplishments on the field, and cricketer W.G. Grace, the Victorian star who continued playing first-rate cricket until he was 60).  The only flaw in the entire book is a production problem that caused the deletion of pages 949 through 980, or between James Ussher and William Whewell. Not a noticeable problem, unless you're looking up information about Queen Victoria.	1998-02-11

The length of these talks give these journalists plenty of space to describe how they go about their work, which can take them from Vietnam and Cambodia (Sydney Schanberg, whose story was the basis for the movie &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;) to the Boeing beat in Seattle (Byron Acohido, who won a Pulitzer for his coverage).         Also interviewed are Gerald Posner, whose book on the JFK assassination, &quot;Case Closed,&quot; is  a brilliant and readable defense of the Warren Commission; conservative advocate David Brock, author of &quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot;; and John Camp, whose stories about Jimmy Swaggert led to the televangelist's downfall. Journalists interested in learning more about the investigative side of their profession will find this worth reading.	1998-02-11

After the 98-page summary of the tournament's 70-odd years follows the known rosters of all the teams who participated, the members of the all-tournament teams, and interviews with 17 participants. If there's a scrap of information existing pertaining to this tournament, Mac Kirkpatrick and Thomas Perry have plowed it up and put it in.	1998-02-11

We don't know if Dani Kahane is a good cop, but he is a fascinating character, and before the last page, Gordon pulls one last joker from the deck that  promises that the scheming will continue in the sequel. This is a fun read, with scheming and double-crossing in the style of &quot;Ruthless People&quot; and &quot;The Grifters.&quot;	1998-02-11

However, there are inconsistencies among the birth and death dates. Some are simply wrong, while others are internally inconsistent (that is, the same fact in two different parts of the book do not agree). But I can't think of another book that has this breadth of information.	1997-11-19

Lovecraft's work by treating it with the scholarly attention paid by academics to more literary writers.<br />  S.T. Joshi makes the case that Lovecraft was more a writer in the tradition of Poe than pulp writers like Robert E. Howard, and he manages to clear away a lot of the brush that has crept over the man. That Lovecraft was an unusual, even eccentric figure is not disputed, but he was very intelligent, read widely in a number of scientific fields, and was serious about his fiction. Joshi makes a compelling case that Lovecraft's work should be separated from the penny-a-word pulp writers that he's lumped with today.	1997-09-08

Read the Kirkus Review for the story summary, so I'll cut to the chase here. Kinky tells a lot of road stories about Willie Nelson, Tom T. Hall (&quot;loved all his songs and both his melodies&quot;) and offers a ribald quote from Kris Kristofferson about Farrah Fawcett-Majors that will make you spit milk through your nose. These stories make &quot;Roadkill&quot; a far more entertaining book than &quot;The Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover&quot; in which he seemed to spend far too much time talking about himself. Kinky is capable of spinning a mystery plot -- &quot;A Case of Lone Star&quot; is still his best -- but &quot;Roadkill&quot; shows Kinky can be ribaldly funny, still capable of making the inner 13-year-old boy on some of us laugh out loud	1997-09-08

Watson, M.D.	Books	4	4	4	N	N	The Great Detective Returns Under Different Disguises	Fans of the Sherlock Holmes stories know that his biographer and friend, Dr. John H. Watson, had placed a battered tin box full of notes about the great detective's cases in the bank vault of Cox and Company of London. Thought destroyed by Nazi bombs during World War II, it turns out that the box had been sold upon WatsonÕs death to a collector, who hired a variety of writers to finish them.<br />  As in any anthology, the results are mixed. But John Betancourt amusingly revives H.G. Wells' socialist hectoring, while Paula Volsky's is chillingly effective in using H.P. Lovecraft's voice to tell the tale of the giant rat of Sumatra. Top prizes goes to Richard Lupoff, whose has Jack Kerouac speed-writing a Holmes story so well that it reads like a lost hallucination from &quot;On the Road,&quot; and William DeAndrea for recreating Holmes as Mike Hammer in a deerstalker hat in &quot;The Adventure of the Cripple Parade.&quot;<br />  Those who hunger for tales about the great detective -- with a difference -- may find themselves irresistibly drawn to &quot;Resurrected Holmes.&quot; One wishes only for a sequel, this time featuring famous women writers.	1997-09-08

This told me things I never found in any other book, including the most important things to ask literary agents, and how to handle pitfalls that you may face after selling your first book. This is a real niche book and highly recommended	1997-07-10
