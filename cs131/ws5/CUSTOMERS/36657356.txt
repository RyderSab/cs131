I read two chapters of it in the bookstore and knew I had to get it.  I did not regret it.  I could relate to the characters, the love scenes were tender, emotion bt. the characters were high, and the ending was just as great as the beginnng.  I have read this authors books before so I should have known this book would be good.  She has a way with emotions in her writing that is outstanding.  She can describe something big like life and love in the simplest words.  Read it if you want feel something as you read.	2005-05-06

I swear and I quote \\"He didn't need to see her eyes to know they were the golden brown color of maple syrup....that her skin was the warm tone of caramel\\" (29).  Hello!  I'm so glad eHarlequin is coming out with more out of the closet interracial romance novels.  This one is about a black woman who lost weight and sleeps with the wrong man, then uses him to pretend to be a fiance.  Very good, short novel.  Danny is lovable and so is Jordan.  Her cousin KEISHA tries to get in the way of their relationship, but love overcomes all.  If you love interracial novels, ever felt bad about your body, or have a thing for sexy firefighters, than this is the novel for you.

She falls in love with a white man yet there are dangers that lurk about as she tries to find her way home again.  She goes back to the 1100's and uses her knowledge and strong will to get through her strange situation.  Kit is a woman of her time who is independent and outspoken.  Marcus is also a man of his time.  A true alpha hero.  There is always something going on in the story.  They go through the battle of wills, but once they declare their love they learn to respect each other for being exactly as they are.  The ending is good and the love scenes are hot.  I just didn't believe how easily she was accepted by the people of that time.  Instead of making her a slave or servent, she ended with being treated with respect from the beginning.  But heck, its fiction and this is a fantasy.  I'm reading it for the romance and not so much for the facts.  If you want a little escape and would like to read a different type of interracial romance novel, then this is for you.	2005-02-05

Yet this book didn't please me as much. It pleased me enough where I read it in one day and want to read her next book that comes out, but with this book I was left with wanting more.  I also agree when the last reviewer was saying how the heroines in Valyan's novels are light with nice hair and so on..It does make me feel bad to read interracial novels with heroines like that, not just in this book but other interracial novels have been like that too, b/c I know I'm not light, with straight hair, and stick slim and as a result can't relate physically to the heroine.  Yet, when a novel is good, who cares how the heroine looks.  It's when a novel is not as good that a reader starts to notice other negative things.   <br />The action in this novel was good, great, but I didn't feel or sometimes understand why the characters were together.  Yeah, the sex was good, but what were doing for each other emotionally. The action kind of over took the romance.  I wish they would have gotten to know each other before sleeping or kissing each other.   <br />I liked the ending of this book and enjoyed all the other characters in the book.  Hope that Chris and Felicia get their own novel.  I also can't wait for Unspoken Promises to come out.	2004-09-08

I didn't know if I would but I was hooked from the first page.  I mean standing at the bus stop reading, forgetting to do anything else, hooked.  This novel is about two people who end up working together when that's the last thing they want to do.  Alayna is trying to support her younger sister and works for Ben \\"Ice\\" to make more money.  Ice comes off as an ass, but turns out to much more on the surface. Alayna comes off as a woman who hates white people and see them as the enemy, but turns out to be so much more.  SHe learns a lot throughout the novel.  Alayna and Ice become work associates, friends, and lastly lovers.  The relationship is slow.  They just don't fall into bed with each other.  Situations come up where they get to know each other even when that's the last thing they want to do.  Each scene with them is important b/c it shows how little by little they began to care about each other.  By the time they make love they are comfortable and real wtih each other, not having to pretend. <br />I liked Alayna's character a lot.  She was a real stong person who didn't take any crap and didn't depend on anyone.  I would say she was kind of a tourtured heroine. Ice had his own problems, but was able to help Alayna work through hers so later she can help him with his'.  They became partners is every sense of the word.	2004-09-08

Houston puts up walls to keep people away b/c he is disfigured, but Amelia is able to get pass the walls and see the great man behind them.  I like the fact that this book focuses on these two characters and the act of them getting to know each other and falling in love.  The author makes sure they have time together to get to know each other and that doesn't change when they get to Houston's brother's house and have to act as if they never fell in love.  I also like the fact that the love scene didn't come until the end.  The whole novel builds up to this point and no one will be disappointed.  If you're the kind of person who likes a whole lot of action in their novels, this book isn't for you.  If you like romances where the romance takes center stage along with the characters, this is for you.	2004-09-08

What really brought out the book for me was the character of Isabel.  This tortured heroine was strong and brave even when bad things were happening around her.  She makes the story.  I also liked Blue, but I wished Susan didn't have the second story line with Blue's son and the girl he liked just because it look away from the romance of Blue and Isabel.

She didn't have a fit when she gained weight and was open to finding love in a place she least expected it.  I also loved the character of Jonathan.  He was shy and sweet and a real woman's man.

I love Yasmine's way of writing, as if she's talking to you over a cup of tea...or coffee.  She doesn't mind giving examples from her own life so the reader can relate.  I also got some new rituals to try in this book and learned more about different gods and goddesses that I never learned about or are not widely known.

Even though the love scenes were tame, the sexual tension was good and the characters had such great love for each other that I didn't notice a lack of detailed love scenes.  <BR>If you enjoy this book, Lady May's Folly, should be read after this one.

Even when Kat tried to push him away, he wouldn't go.  Those two characters shined!  They were truly soul mates.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read a romance that will make them feel almost four emotions at one time.

I also loved the other characters in the book who were crazy in both good and bad ways.  I can't wait to read other books in the series and hopes this series last a long time.	2003-07-02

They were both suffering.  Holly from being a former hooker and J.D. from losing his family.  They found hope and a second chance with each other.  What made me want to read the book more was the fact that it was a romance suspense and I love trying to figure out who did the crime. The book wasn't as good as Darkling I listen in my opinion but it was worth reading.	2003-06-08

The characters were good and so was the story line.  I liked how Henrico never gave up on Jacci.  He really loved her.  I especially loved how he courted her on the ship.  This was a quick two day read for me and worth every min.  I suggest this book to picky interracial romance readers.	2003-04-30

I love to read about two things: strong yet vunerable heroines and Native Americans.  This books had both.  I not only read a tender love story, but also learned more about the Apache that I did not know before.  The heroine is half Apache and Sioux, while the hero is half Commache.  It was an exciting and quick read.  I just hope that Lindsay McKenna writes more novels with Native American characters.  She writes about them well.  P.S. I especially liked the main character Akiva.  She really made the book.  She grew the most in the book and even inspired me.	2003-04-18

She left all the sterotypes that seem to attach themselves to these types of books at the door.  I really felt like Wolf was a Native American instead of a white man in a Native American body.  I liked that she made Wolf the gentleman that Serena/Brave Heart needed after being raped.  Like I said before, she writes these types of books well, unlike some writers who shouldn't write these types of books at all.  I think my favorite part about the book was the fact that instead of Wolf being this warrior type \\"I am the man, no one is better than me, I have such a big ego...\\", he was a medicine man who was not only a good father, but husband as well.	2003-04-18

It talked about a Native American man falling in love with a plus-size woman.  Even though she lost weight she is not skinny.  I liked the fact that both characters were not perfect.  The hero was a recovering alcoholic who is taking care of his niece.  He is a good man who thinks he is not worth of the woman's love, but he is.	2003-04-12

They are not perfect, but they are good people who deserved the ending they got.	2003-04-12

I think this is a book that both teens and adults will enjoy.	2003-03-15

She was a dark-haired woman, over thirty, strong, independent, and had a job.  Glory, aka Proud One, was the type of woman that makes reading these type of books worth it.<BR>Two Arrows was a good hero.  Even though he's an alcholic whose been through a lot in his life.  He and Glory gets a second chance through their love for each other.<BR>I have a strong interest in the Native American culture yet I don't read too many NA romance books because I don't like the way the NA's are betrayed.  This book gave me insight to what Native Americans went through and a glimpse at their history.  <BR>Two complaints that I have is that the author used the word \\"sword\\" to describe the male parts and I thought she could have found a better word than that.  I also felt the author could have written an epilogue instead of rushing the ending.  <BR>The love scenes were good and was more about love than trying to be erotic.  On a whole, I would recommend this book, I think you will enjoy it.	2003-03-15

It was special. I had already read It had to be you by SEP and I didn't think her writing could get any better, but I was wrong. To me this book was better and so far is my favorite. She so reminds me of my favorite author Jill Barnett, but contemporary. She makes me sigh with happiness for the characters and I love her endings. <BR>People are wrong to say Daisy was stupid because she was not that way at all. She was kind and sweet and sensitive to the world around her. There is nothing wrong with that. She did need to grow up a bit and she did along with Alex. There was not a scene in the book that I didn't like.<BR>The love scenes were great and touching and the secondary characters shined along with Daisy and Alex. This book is the kind of book to read when you want to relax and escape for a while then when you're finish, read again. This book is simply a keeper.	2003-03-10

I read this book thinking that it would be just ok, but it was really better than I thought it would be.  Touching and sweet, its gave me a glimpse of the plight of the Navajo Native Americans that I didn't have before.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read romance novels with Native American characters, anyone interested in Navajo history, or anyone who wants a quick read.	2003-03-07

I read and brought this book a few years ago and I love it now as much as I did back then.  It is a very special book that is both spiritual and romantic.  It might not have the ending that everyone wanted, but I feel that if the book had ended any other way, it would not have been as good.  I cried at the end of the book and once in a while a pick it up and read it again.	2003-03-07

When I started reading this book I didn't know what to expect, but then after I read the first few pages, I couldn't stop!  I was on the edge of my seat.  I read the book in two days.  I laughed, cried, and almost fainted as I read the love scenes.  It was great!  I recommend everyone to read this book.  You will not be disappointed. I only wished I brought the book instead of getting from the library.  I think I'll go to the store right now and buy my very own copy...:-)	2003-02-27

I loved the characters, Phoebe and Dan, along with all the others.  It was so funny.  I liked how Phoebe was strong yet vunerable.  She made the book!  The love scenes were hot yet sweet and the ending was so good!  I never felt that good at the ending of a story in a long time.

Romance, adventure, a little saddness(but in a good way) and my favorite, humor.  I loved all the characters, but I have to say that my favorite couple was Tia and Malachi.  He knew what he wanted and he did what had to be done in order to get Tia.  Tia was the character who grew the most in the book.  I also liked Cleo a lot who brought some spunk into the book.  I could relate to Tia and to me Malachi was a real charmer.  I also loved how they tricked the bad guy in the end.  This book had me at the edge of my seat!  This book was my favorite next to Honest Illusions and I never had as much fun reading Nora's books as I did when read Honest Illusions and Three Fates. Believe me this book is not to be missed!  If you like a good romance suspense, this book is for you!	2003-01-17

I can understand why some people didn't like the book and after reading the reviews I was thinking about not reading the book, but I glad I didn't listen. I enjoyed the character Lollie. She wasn't perfect, but she had a lot of heart and was just what Sam needed. Yes, he did say some things that I didn't like, but I feel that it just added to who he was and his individuality. Both characters saved each other and helped each other grow. I laughed while reading this book because of all the things Lollie got into. I love the characters that Jill Barnett makes up. She is one of my favorite authors and I have yet to read a book by her that I didn't like. I read all of her books, but two and can't wait for her to write more. Jill Barnett has the writer's gift!	2002-12-21

I just finished reading it and it was one of the best books I read in a long time.  I loved both characters a lot.  Lily was strong yet vunerable.  She was so funny and such a breath of fresh air compared to many of the heriones today who are the typical innocent virgins.  She did not follow the rules of her time like everyone else.  She did her own thing and people loved that she did.  Alex was such the perfect mate.  He was caring and strong.  He turned out to be a better hero than I thought he would be.  I don't think the cover of the book does him justice.  Also the love scenes were great!  They didn't take away from the romance, but added to it.  This is my favorite book by Lisa so far and I can't wait to read Dreaming of You by Lisa next!	2002-12-07
