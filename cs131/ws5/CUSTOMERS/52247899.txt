The material to be gleaned would be similiar to that gained from a two or three day introductory training course.<br />The introductory material is well dealt with and clearly explained, the authors are definately at their most comfortable with this traditional style web design using dreamweaver, and this is the books strongest area.<br />Personally i wouldnt see too much material here which would be of interest to an intermediate or advanced dreamweaver user, the new features are dealt with fairly quickly at the front of the book, and beyond that there is a quick overview of the new data driven dreamweaver using the various technoligies, but useful only as an introduction to these technologies.<br />For the designer the book much like all big overview books of this type offers nothing new, the design examples are very basic, and there is nothing new or challenging, the book is more software centric than design centric, most useful as a reference for the various dialogue boxes and settings, but certainly not inspirational in design terms.<br />The book design itself is somewhat flawed, nice cover, but the interior layout is poorly designed, in a book of this size somewhat understandable as there is such a high volume of content.<br />The variousinterviews with designers, are superflous, and run in with the body copy to the degree of annoyance, again more a layout flaw, but these interviews are of limited use.<br />I would also question the long delay before introducing the site management tools, in fact first introduced in depth at page 700, these in my opinion should have been integrated earlier.<br />The newest and most exciting side of dreamweaver the data driven side associated with ultradev previously is seriously under represented here, and a very basic overview of the various technologies and a very simple example site is all we get. This section also lacks the flow and confidence of earlier sections.<br />in summary, the book offeres a good tour through the software, and it is a very good learning guide for the beginner to dreamweaver, for the advanced user there is some useful reference material but lacks serious depth in the new areas.	2002-09-11

Its a big book desnsely packed with information. I wavered between a 4 and a 5, because theres a couple of faults with the book, but on consideration theres so much information packed in, compared to some of the photohsop books on the market it doesnt warrant the 5.<br />My main complaints with this book are firstly the design and layout of interior pages is very poor, the screengrabs range from shoddy to badly captured, and ive a feeling a few older screen grabs ahev found their way in here as well. whatever software you guys are using for screen grabs you ned to think again, some of the screen grabs havent been cropped well and just look messy.<BR>As to the layout, with such an information heavy book, layout would have made the readers life so much easier, the vertical sideways title page are terrible, and to be honest the rest of the book just looks like a quark template stuffed full of content in a hurry.<BR>Hire a new designer and this books probelms are dealt with. compare with the layout on some of the other books around, a design orientated book just should not look this bad.<BR>my other problem is that some of the graphics and examples in the book are just poor, of little practical use, and some of the artwork used in examples is just laughable, i get the feeling that the authors do know a lot about photoshop, but some of their design work is bad.<br />despite the horrors of the books design, and some really stupid unrealistic examples, there is so much information in here i think it warrants a high rating, this book would serve well as a guide to learning photohsop, and it seems evident that this is where the approach and material have been created from.<BR>There is an enormous ammount of information here and it is very learning orientated, the ammount of information can work against the book in one respect as its somewhat daunting and can be hard to find things, but it covers a lot of informationand thats the imprortant thinig.<BR>i would disagree about some reviewers commensta bout this being the most authoritive book for photographers using photoshop, but it has a few elemnts which are useful.	2002-08-15
