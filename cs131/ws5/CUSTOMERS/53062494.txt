US	53062494	R3BM291KU8W08G	0060543558	129489353	Cover Up: What the Government Is Still Hiding About the War on Terror	Books	4	38	45	N	N	Good research, interesting, but doesn't go far enough	I read \\"Cover Up\\" because I heard the author (PL) on a very popular <br />nationally-syndicated radio show. He was part of a panel discussing <br />9-11, of course. I really couldn't decide whether PL thought that 9-11 <br />was a govt. conspiracy, but he was very critical of a very \\"strident\\" <br />conspiracy radio host/film maker. PL claimed that he wrote only what <br />he could prove, and that the \\"powers that be\\" actually want people to <br />believe in vague, high-level conspiracies rather than getting at the \\"real\\" <br />facts. Having read many books on 9/11 that indeed point to a high-level <br />govt. conspiracy, I wanted to read \\"Cover Up\\" to get another point of <br />view about 9-11, this despite the scoffs from my friends! <br /> <br />     I found \\"Cover Up\\" interesting for the most part, also quite  <br />informative, as if a short primer on domestic terrorism (I will assume  <br />that PL got his facts straight), though as I'll discuss below, I am still <br />not certain what PL really thinks about 9-11.  <br /> <br />     \\"Cover Up\\" depicts shocking, outrageous corruption, perhaps the most  <br />egregious corruption is the FBI/Justice Dept.'s cover up of the relationship  <br />between a fairly high-level agent and a Mafia hitman who killed many people  <br />in a war among \\"families.\\" While a large element of organized crime is  <br />apparently eliminated, laws are broken at every turn, and when the FBI  <br />man is prosecuted, he answers \\"I can't remember\\" 44 times, and is allowed  <br />to retire on full pension, and to make sure the corruption is never revealed,  <br />an honest cop's reputation is ruined, and he is stripped of his pension. <br /> <br />     If you read \\"Cover Up,\\" and I recommend that you do, you will get the <br />tie-in between the son of the Mafia hitman and Ramzi Yousef, whom PL <br />claims devised the bomb that killed a young engineer in the so-called <br />\\"Bojinka\\" plane bombing, which the author connects to theTWA 800 disaster,  <br />in a convincing way. PL also connects all of this, along with incredible  <br />negligence on the FBI's part, with terrorism and 9-11, and the details are  <br />quite Interesting.  <br /> <br />     PL clearly spent a great deal of time interviewing the wives of the  <br />9-11 victims, who pressed for a very long time before the govt. agreed to  <br />have a commission, and he shows many aspects of blatant, deliberate  <br />suppression of evidence by the commission, many members of which were very  <br />compromised, and had much to lose by getting at the real truth. <br /> <br />     Yet I found the book lacking in certain aspects of 9-11, esp. <br />the lack of a deeper analysis of what exactly happened on 9-11. PL asks  <br />exactly the same questions that those who think that the govt. at the very <br />least knew in advance of the attacks, yet he makes no attempt to answer <br />them, and cites not one of the \\"conspiracy\\" books that do try to answer <br />the difficult questions.  <br /> <br />     A very key part of 9-11, as discussed in \\"Cover Up,\\" is simply reported <br />and nothing more. Repeatedly we are told that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Yousef's <br />uncle, is the mastermind beind 9-11, yet I remember no evidence or further <br />details in the book, just a reference to PL's prior book on 9-11. Also KSM's  <br />arrest and interrogation are kept secret, yet again we are not told anything  <br />beyond this, and conspiracy researchers would obviously wonder what the real <br />story is?! <br /> <br />     So what we get is an interesting read but I was left wondering if what  <br />is presented in \\"Cover Up\\" is just a shadow of the deeper truth. Still, I  <br />recommend reading the book.	2005-07-26
US	53062494	R33YR38M81HATV	1576753018	331881073	Confessions of an Economic Hit Man	Books	4	15	20	N	N	Amazing book, amazing person, MUST read!	I recommend this book very, very highly. Mr. Perkins is a   one-of-a-kind, \\"been there done that\\" person. \\"Confessions\\" is an   easy-to-read book yet covers very complex issues, so please excuse   what are clearly some contradictory opinions of the reviewer!     On a much, much smaller scale I could relate to what Mr. Perkins   discusses in his \\"Confessions,\\" deservedly a NY Times bestseller. I had   to decide whether to sell out myself, and I did to a certain extent, and   thus while working for BP I was given the opportunity to travel to a   number of countries, where at times I saw the horrifying differences   between the haves and the have-nots. And like him, at times I tried to   speak the language or at least learn about the culture of the country or  I was visiting, and because of that and as well as having a certain   openness was given the opportunity to interact with denizens of countries   at a deeper level than those Americans who think that we are No. 1, and   the rest of the world should be subservient to our dictates. Fortunately   I was really just a \\"lackey,\\" I just did their bidding, I wasn't part of   the huge money deals that \\"hit men\\" like Mr. Perkins were involved in.     I don't think the author would be surprised to read that people who  read his \\"Confessions\\" can at the same or different times be amazed, feel   great admiration, and anger! Thankfully he provides a fairly in depth   background of his early life, specifically being a \\"poor underdog,\\" that   later perhaps helps us to understand why he took great advantage of   business opportunities given almost no one at such a very young age. Yet   he doesn't  \\"sell out\\" right away either. He spends 3 years working in   Ecuador for the Peace Corps, and as mentioned already, he is broad-minded   enough to learn languages and cultures. Throughout his career, even before   he can no longer deal with the way he feels about his \\"hit man\\" activities,   he is always learning about the places and peoples he visits, and (again   as I have found) people in other countries really appreciate Americans who   are interested in them. I found these parts of the book very telling in the   sense that a) even people who might resent EHM realize that they are just   doing a job in a very complicated world, and b) surely when we engage people   openly and fairly we can get along much better than when we force our   worldview on them.     One of the other reviewers gave a link to an audio interview, which I  would highly recommend, where Mr. Perkins states repeatedly that he was   seduced by money, sex, and power, and his handlers knew he could be seduced!       As other reviewers have noted, the book is not consistent in the   detail of what is discussed. A number of chapters are less than 5 pages, in  fact I don't think that any chapter is even 10 pages! The shorter chapters   leave you feeling that a great deal has been omitted, though perhaps this is   because the author had so much material to cover he only wanted to hit the   high points. The chapter on the deals that were negotiated between (US)   corporations and the Saudis after the oil embargo of 1973 substantiated   other material I've come across, and was the right length to me.      One could easily imagine a movie made of the author's experiences, though   it would take quite a few actors in different countries to do it   properly!     Yes, most \\"idealists\\" certainly feel anger at what the author was a   part of, making great profits for big corporations and himself, while saddling   Third World countries with huge debts, which they must service rather than   helping the indigent, the ones we have been led to believe are helped by the   often false term \\"foreign aid.\\" Where I felt the most anger was on p. 154,   where Mr. Perkins negotiates a deal where he is paid three times what he made   as an economic hit man for doing nothing more than being available as an   expert witness! I found it impossible to understand where his conscience is   at that point, though he certainly makes use of his free time to work on   issues such as alternative energy and taking people on tours of the Amazon.     The best chapter for me is Chapter 30, \\"The United States Invades Panama.\\"   On pp. 180-1, in very blunt language, Perkins writes about how   businesspeople have become wholly desensitized to what they are doing and   how they are affecting the less fortunate, and yet convince themselves that  what they are doing is \\"legal\\" and thus justifiable. And how many of us   profit in our investments from these activities? Also, the chapters that  cover how leaders of countries who don't cooperate with the \\"corprotocracy\\"   are killed are totally devastating!     One thing about the book that I found somewhat strange is the   author's constant use of the word \\"coincidence,\\" that our lives are greatly   influenced by certain \\"coincidences,\\" that even by his own admission happen   often at exactly the right time. Since he is an expert in indigenous cultures   and shamanism one would think that he would be well acquainted with the   term \\"synchronicity,\\" though this is not exactly an ancient term, yet surely   it implies a connection with a \\"universal flow\\" we try to get in sync  with. In fact Mr. Perkins seems to go out of his way to use coincidence   rather than a more \\"New Age\\" term!	2005-02-03
US	53062494	RKTQPA2HY66QH	0300102321	199906066	Red Sky at Morning: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment	Books	5	20	22	N	N	Excellent book, but really more a textbook than action guide	For a book whose main chapters comprise little more than 200  <br />pages, \\"Red Sky At Morning\\" is amazingly comprehensive. Written by a  <br />high-level environmentalist in the Carter Administration, (perhaps the  <br />last Administration that really cared about such things), the book <br />covers many aspects of the environmental state/crisis we are in, <br />in a style that is always concise, usually with the right amount  <br />of detail (at times too much about policies!), and yet engaging at  <br />the same time. <br /> <br />     Because of the author's involvement with environmental  <br />causes from the movement's outset in the late 1960's-early 70's, <br />the book provides a nice history of the enviromental movement as <br />well as a deep analysis of problems and solutions that have <br />worked or not worked. One interesting and obvious point brought out <br />is that at the beginning the environmental movement could focus on  <br />national issues like pollution and power generation, while inevitably  <br />with globalization the issues have become far more serious, complex,  <br />and contentious. The many successes obtained by the hard-working people <br />on the national level, aided greatly by the public's outcry for sounder  <br />policies (which today has amazingly deteriorated into widespread apathy),  <br />are much harder to come by on an international level, obviously because  <br />of conflicts with issues like the need for endless economic growth as  <br />well as national sovereignty. And yet we are reminded in the book that  <br />when scientists announced the serious degradation of the ozone layer,  <br />largely by CFC's, the world did unite in the 1980's Montreal Protocol to  <br />relatively quickly take very effective action, such that it appears that  <br />the ozone layer will restore itself by mid-century.  <br /> <br />     Thus \\"Red Sky\\" provides a thorough analysis of the problems we face  <br />today, as well as modelsand solutions. The author feels that while  <br />there is hope, it is almost too late to effectively resolve the mass of  <br />complex issues of this potentially planetary \\"holocaust.\\" Yet in the  <br />chapter \\"Attacking the Root Causes\\" he provides a very well-thought out  <br />list of eight \\"transitions to sustainability,\\" such as lowering the  <br />population, reducing poverty by 1/2 by 2015, and creating environmentally  <br />benign technologies. In the chapter entitled \\"The Most Fundamental  <br />Transition Of All,\\" he discusses what activists like F. Capra wrote  <br />about years ago, the \\"paradigm shift\\" to \\"eco-feminism,\\" working with  <br />and caring for nature rather than conquering it. [I noted my own former  <br />idealism that has turned in part to cynicism as I read this chapter!] <br /> <br />     Yet \\"Red Sky\\" is really not directed at individuals acting alone  <br />or even in small groups. Its main focus is clearly to reach ingtelligent,  <br />young people who might want to major in environmental studies, and  <br />secondarily open-minded policy makers. Many sections have detailed  <br />policy proposals and guidelines, which is not surprising given the  <br />author's involvement with both governmental departments as well as  <br />NGO's (non-governmental organizations). While I found the many pages  <br />devoted to policy issues very useful in understanding both the way these  <br />organizations work and how intricate the relationships among large-scale  <br />entities must be, I prefer books that are more oriented to individuals and  <br />small organizations, since that is my own orientation. Yet NGO's like WWF  <br />and EDF may be our best hope, and many of them do work on international <br />issues. <br /> <br />     Two areas the author does not cover as well as others are the new fuel  <br />sources like hydrogen (though p. 158 is good), and he also does not mention  <br />organizations like the bioneers whose members have been working on sustainable  <br />solutions since the first warnings about the environment were sounded years  <br />ago, and have devised in many cases very well-thought out (and at deep levels)  <br />solutions to a surprisingly large number of the environmental problems we face  <br />today (he does cite A. Lovins and P. Hawkins, who are assoc. with the group). <br />And precisely the political process, which the author has been a part of,  <br />has surely been a very strong force against implementing the solutions of  <br />these \\"anti-establishment\\" groups, due to obvious money issues.  <br /> <br />     One book (or at least a web visit) I'd strongly recommend is from p. 160,  <br />the work of Wm. McDonough (\\"Cradle to Cradle\\"). <br /> <br />     The last chapter (available at the book's website for download) is a  <br />mind-boggling compendium of books and web sites (information overload  <br />squared!) which cover the eight transitions to sustainability discussed so  <br />well in the book.  <br /> <br />     While the author and many reviewers think that it is almost too late  <br />to \\"save\\" the environment, I see a lot of positive because of the large  <br />numbers of people and organizations working so diligently to create the <br />balance we so clearly need between using resources wisely and providing  <br />sustainable lives for the world's enormous population. With public awareness  <br />and a change in politics (when?!), things will improve environmentally.	2004-11-07
US	53062494	R2HCLBHJZS0QKD	0312303653	981676251	High Tide: The Truth About Our Climate Crisis	Books	4	13	23	N	N	Fine, readable book, but who decides what is urgent?	We live in a time of endless urgencies and endless busy-ness.  There are countless distractions and practically endless things to  entertain and amuse ourselves, countless ads, writings, etc., trying   to grab our attention for however long they can get it.        Thus it's extremely difficult to mobilize large groups of people   into taking action as a whole unless they are certain that it's   absolutely urgent, as we saw after 9-11.        \\"High Tide\\" is a very good book because it is a most interesting and  engaging travel guide, easy to read, and the author combines his mostly   pleasant commentary about his travels and the very diverse peoples he   interacts with in different parts of the world with serious, thoughtful   observations in those regions that \\"prove\\" what he and environmentalists   like him believe is coming: the imminent collapse of the environment, and   he leaves no doubt that much of the cause is human-induced global warming.   He also does a fine job of interspersing easy-to-understand statistics   from scientists and climatologists that almost always relate to what he   is seeing and analysing in his travels.          Before I wrote this review I chose not to double-check his statistics,   but his references appear very sound to me, and what adds credibility to  his claims is that he is able to interview top-level policy-makers,   politicians, and scientists. Thus while I have read that, for example, in   some areas glaciers are actually expanding, which he never mentions, I   noted many alarming trends, many new to me.          On p. 111 he writes that over 70% of the world's sandy shorelines  are retreating, then that 80-90% of the beaches are eroding. On p. 114  we read that 100 million people (in just 4 poor countries) are at risk   due to sea-level rising. In a most interesting chapter, \\"Red Clouds  In China,\\" we learn that large areas of northern China are becoming  inhabitable due to drought and dust. On p. 231 he writes that 95% of   Alaska's glaciers are thinning, and the rate has doubled since the   mid-1990's! Finally, pp. 237-9 is a discussion of the impending water   crisis in places like Lima, Peru (where the author lived as a child).         Mr. Lynas also provides a very readable summary of the Kyoto  protocol and related issues related to enforcement of CO2 emissions  by participating and non-participating countries (like the US) in  the final chapter, \\"Feeling The Heat.\\"         So clearly from the above, if you believe the statistics, we  do have an urgent crisis, and that's why I started my review by  showing that unless the public feels an urgency en masse', little  or nothing is going to be done. It is late in the election campaign  of 2004, and I read nothing in the mainstream media about what we  are going to do to change our ways, to improve the environment.  It seems that most people, at least in the US, are just thinking about   their survival, and that means business as usual, I am afraid. \\"High   Tide\\" actually affirms this: there are many people in \\"baking\\" Alaska   who want an increase in oil exploration there because they need the   subsidies from the oil companies. And that's why if you look at the   list of the author's recommendations (pp. 286-297), comments like   \\"stop all exploration and development of new oil, coal, and gas\\"   just don't \\"cut it,\\" they are beyond anything even remotely possible,   unless, of course, there is a crisis that awakens people. Other   recommendations, like using flourescent light bulbs, are much more  reasonable. Yet I came away from the book feeling that asking people  to as if stop their busy lives to devote themselves to saving the   environment isn't realistic, and it's debatable that small numbers  of environmentalists can effect the kinds of changes the author claims   are desperately needed.               This might be a side issue, but I also wonder why environmentalists   like the author often don't mention vegetarianism (and animal rights) at   all. Surely the resources saved by producing less meat products, to say   nothing of the health and \\"spiritual\\" benefits, could contribute, if only   in a small way, to reducing the harm done by humanity to the planet. Frankly   I found the plethora of stories about eating, where the unquestioning   killing and consumption of animals was discussed very glibly, to be a   real \\"turn off,\\" esp. given such concern about the earth, and I wonder about   the \\"karma\\" of people who consume animals with such impunity, though clearly   in some areas a vegetarian diet is not possible.	2004-10-16
US	53062494	R3VY039B6BUFEO	0618239774	978444819	The End of Oil: On the Edge of a Perilous New World	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Outstanding, readable, and recommended	If a person wants to get an idea of what to expect from this book, <br />I'd say, get the hardback and look at the picture of the author on the <br />back inside jacket - it's *very* intense, and so is this book. I don't  <br />have any of the credentials some of the reviewers have cited, but I've  <br />read on this subject for many years, and I'd recommend \\"The End Of Oil\\"  <br />very highly. It might be the best book available at this time that attempts  <br />to cover the history of mankind's useage of energy, the entire \\"mainstream\\" <br />international energy paradigm at present (both fossil and renewable fuels),  <br />and also pose short and long-term solutions as well as can be done at this <br />time. As there are already many fine reviews of this excellent book,  I  <br />will discuss other aspects of it I didn't see elsewhere. <br /> <br />    A very readable aspect of \\"The End of Oil\\" is the way the author <br />frames a number of chapters with experiences he had traveling the world,  <br />seeing things first-hand, and interviewing people who work directly  <br />with energy issues. These real-life experiences are a nice complement to  <br />the huge numbers of facts and figures he provides. As one example,  <br />Chapter 2, \\"The End Of The Easy Oil,\\" is brought to life by the author's  <br />\\"on site\\" descriptions (from multiple trips) of the problems encountered  <br />extracting oil in Azerbaijan, once considered a sure thing and surely a  <br />very vital part of that country's hopes for even a small measure of  <br />prosperity. I also compliment the author on his presentation of the  <br />\\"numbers\\" data in a way that requires only a minimum of math and technical  <br />knowledge.  <br /> <br />    \\"The End Of Oil\\" really tells it like it is when it comes to the apathy <br />of so many in the US about energy itself as well as energy's relationship <br />to the environment. I agree with his quotes from experts that it will take  <br />huge environmental catastrophes to awaken people out of their complacency, <br />though I am still not certain the greenhouse effect is as large as is claimed. <br /> <br />    Yet certain very obvious points stand out, and I doubt a person would <br />have to read the book to get the details. It's quite obvious that the <br />Saudi's want to protect their market share for as long as they can, <br />esp. given their assurances to always provide enough oil during market <br />disruptions, and I won't say that is trivial, and surely has taken years <br />of careful negotiations. It's even more obvious what the current  <br />administration's energy policies are. And I must say, I struggle to stay  <br />interested in the energy debate when it is so intertwined with the  <br />capitalistic paradigm of greed, money, and endless growth, which leads to  <br />endless conflicts about jobs vs. the environment, and where the billions of  <br />dollars of fossil-fuel infrastructures must be protected, not only because <br />the overwhelming majority of politicians and policies are under the thumb of  <br />the energy conglomerates, but also to avoid the inevitable chaos of the <br />unimaginable, at least at this point: an addicted civilization w/o  <br />mind-boggling amounts of oil. So we have this endless \\"drama:\\"  <br />environmentally, is it already too late, or can we curb CO2 emissions  <br />before the environmental disasters get out of hand, and yet can we also  <br />sustain economic growth, whatever our energy future, so that the  <br />not-so-rich can generally do little more than just pay their bills while  <br />the fat cats rake in the dollars (or Euros, or whatever it is!)? <br /> <br />    The author is a fine writer, but I wish he had written about  <br />well-documented suppresion of alternative technologies by oil companies  <br />and scientists, to say nothing of billions of dollars in \\"black budget\\"  <br />programs - surely some of these are connected to new energy sources. Also,  <br />more \\"real life\\" discussions of the suffering and damage fossil-fuel  <br />technologies are causing worldwide would have made the book more complete. <br /> <br />    And in the end, as individuals we can't solve energy issues all over  <br />the world, or stop the Chinese from buying cars, etc. Perhaps the best we  <br />can do is to act in our own homes and in our communities to foster  <br />alternative technologies. Home owners have some very good choices to  <br />eliminate greenhouse gases using renewable energy sources, even to the  <br />point of selling electricity back to the grid, though especially for  <br />older homes these technologies are not cheap. Surely in the end the  <br />only we way we can begin to try to solve the very complicated issues of  <br />energy is to act locally while at the same time doggedly insisting that  <br />the government invest in new technologies and create the volumes (for  <br />example, government fleets of hybrids and/or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles)  <br />that will ensure the lowest possible costs for renewable technlogies, as <br />was done long ago in chip manufacturing. Once the costs come down and the  <br />engineering problems are resolved, the claims by experts, that for example,  <br />renewable technologies can only provide 10-20% of the total world energy  <br />needs, will hopefully be disproven.	2004-09-08
US	53062494	R1FA3UTKOZ8HFL	0892133341	675240621	Human Devolution: A Vedic Alternative to Darwin's Theory	Books	4	163	181	N	Y	Encyclopedic compilation; guarded recommendation	I read with great interest the shorter version of \\"Forbidden<br />Archaeology,\\" \\"The Hidden History of the Human Race,\\" and with even<br />more interest \\"Forbidden Archaeology's Impact,\\" a large book of<br />reviews/criticisms of the author's monumental first book along with<br />Mr. Cremo's counter-countercritisms. I am definitely one of those who<br />thinks that science has gotten way out of hand when it comes to rejecting<br />anything beyond the physical. The author is among the leading anti-scientism<br />voices in the world. \\"Human Devolution\\" was written to answer critics who<br />\\"demanded\\" that he be more \\"scientific\\" and provide an alternative to<br />Darwinian evolution, rather than just criticizing it. As he comes from a<br />Vedic perspective, \\"Human Devolution\\" purports to be from that point of view.<br />The title encapsulates the Eastern belief that to occupy a physical body,<br />a soul \\"devolves\\" into matter; we are not physical-only, soulless beings.<br />  As a reviewer, one has to decide if the author actually presents a<br />coherent model to counter Darwinian evolution. With regrets I think that<br />Mr. Cremo does not present such a model, certainly not a scientific model,<br />with clear data points that lead to clear conclusions, and in fact he<br />definitely argues for not only a \\"default\\" God of the gaps when the<br />neo-Darwinian and Big Bang models are found wanting, but the \\"gap approach\\"<br />is the main approach to prove the validity of the Vedic model. For example,<br />on p. 239, after rightfully dismissing a quantum mechanical approach to<br />consciousness and non-locality, in comes the Vedic model: everything<br />emanates from God, the \\"Supersoul\\" is all knowing, etc. Fine, but too<br />vague for me, certainly not a detailed model, and I will at least credit<br />scientists, who for the most part are very conservative and will usually<br />present good data points.<br />  I can agree with Mr. Cremo that spiritual \\"models\\" are given by Divine<br />revelation, but we must at least admit that they are often quite nebulous,<br />if not overwhelming. To the point, in the final chapter of the book there<br />is an all-too brief discussion of some of the time scales in the Vedic<br />teachings. We learn about the Day/Night of Brahmin (4.32 billion years),<br />composed of manvantaras and yugas, but little \\"filling in the gaps.\\" And<br />the real kicker is in the prior chapter; while presenting a very fine<br />discussion of the 6 crucial constants in the universe which are so finely<br />tuned it could not possibly be a matter of chance, we read that the \\"ultimate\\"<br />number of the Vedic model is actually 311 trillion years, the \\"breath of Maha<br />Vishnu!\\" Such numbers make Big Bang cosmology look young, but again I yearn<br />for more of the details of the reasons for these cycles, also what goes on<br />in the cosmic Hierarchy, in the physical world(s), during these cycles, rather than<br />the detachment of incomprehensibly large numbers.<br />  The book would have better been entitled \\"Forbidden Anthropology and<br />Suppressed Scientific Research Into The Paranormal.\\" There are staggering<br />amounts of details on comparative anthropology, particularly as it relates<br />to common mythologies about a Supreme God, a separate Creator God, and<br />paranormal beliefs among a wide variety of cultures. This is more or less<br />presented in conjunction with a topic Cremo covers with great success:<br />the integrity and open-mindedness of scientists from Newton and Kepler<br />(Middle Ages) to 19th century pioneers Wallace (co-founder of evolutionary<br />theory) and Crookes, who either believed in a higher God force behind the<br />material world, or themselves did extensive research into the paranormal.<br />The author devotes a lot of pages to Wallace's writings late in his life,<br />writings you will never see in contemporary scientific discussions.<br />  Yet these details are to me another problem with the book, an<br />incredible number of pages in a number of sections covering mediums<br />and seances. Certainly there is some amazing data here, but surely<br />more effort could have been spent on clarifying the Vedic model than<br />bringing out yet another seance or medium. As for the discussion on<br />comparative mythologies, I can only say that at times I found the<br />details interesting, at other times not, and what is really lacking is<br />an overall consistency about what is being covered!<br />  A real irony in \\"Human Devolution\\" is the author's great ability to<br />summarize scientific theories and concepts when he so chooses. I am not<br />that well-versed in genetics, paleontology, and cosmology (to name a<br />few disciplines!), yet I much enjoyed his discussions in these areas,<br />but let me be clear, I am not saying he is completely correct either.<br />Ch. 3 is a good presentation of possible proof that non-human species<br />(insects and plants) existed long before the Darwinists would allow.<br />Ch. 4, covering genes and molecular evolution, is clear and interesting,<br />as is the discussion in Ch. 10 on Sir Martin Rees's \\"Just Six Numbers,\\"<br />mentioned above.<br />  \\"Human Devolution\\" has many interesting references, including obscure<br />though relevant books and articles, and that is to the credit of the author<br />and his research assistant(s). In the end I would recommend \\"Human Devolution,\\"<br />but be ready to skim!!	2004-04-12

Yet because there are something<BR>like 2 billion Christians in this world, and I've certainly known<BR>Christians who hold to many different viewpoints, I am fascinated<BR>by the popularity of Jesus. When I found out that there was a group<BR>of scholars who questioned much of the NT (New Testament) I was very <BR>excited to read through their materials. But until I read \\"Gospel <BR>Truth\\" I had never found one book that summarized so excellently <BR>the writings of the scholars who question the literalism of the NT.<BR>Mr. Shorto does a totally first-rate job in this regard, and also <BR>meshes his own almost always keen insights with the research he<BR>presents.<br />    I knew that the Jesus Seminar had rejected about 80% of the NT <BR>stories, but I had no idea of the scope of what they had rejected, <BR>nor did I know that one of the other scholars who also rejects much <BR>of the NT's literalism, J. Meier, actually works for the Vatican! <BR>I think the author makes a very good point in Ch. 12, \\"The Historical <BR>Jesus Goes To Church,\\" that it is not easy for priests in their <BR>churches to share the scholarship about the historical Jesus, clearly <BR>because to many the Jesus in the Gospels *is* the historical Jesus.<br />    I will mention only a few of the points that were most salient<BR>to me, and recommend the book to any who haven't read it with an<BR>interest in the subject, though of course the faith issue does not<BR>resonate with me at all as it probably does with most readers.<br />    Repeatedly the author states that there is no way for us to<BR>really know what the NT (Jesus) meant, when, for example, he<BR>attacked the money-changers, as well what he meant when he<BR>spoke of the \\"Kingdom of God,\\" in the latter case because of<BR>very unclear parables. Another mind-blower (though it makes much <BR>sense when we consider that surely Jesus was working within the <BR>realm of Judaism, not intending to form a new religion) was the <BR>way NT stories were clearly as if updated versions of Old Testament <BR>(OT) stories. One of many examples of NT from OT were the words <BR>Christ purportedly spoke on the cross: \\"my God, why have you <BR>forsaken me.\\" Only these are the same words that begin Psalm 22! <BR>The match between this psalm and the crucifixion stories is <BR>succinctly discussed on pp. 205-6.<br />    Scholarship has completely rejected the virgin birth story.<BR>Scholarship has also rejected the Passion narratives in all the<BR>gospels: \\"No one even knows whether a trial of Jesus ever took<BR>place.\\" Quoting Raymond Brown: \\"The passion accounts are not history,<BR>they are dramatic narratives.\\" Referring to the virgin birth and<BR>passion accounts, the author explicitly uses the term \\"invented\\"<BR>in referring to the \\"literal truths\\" of stories in the NT, and he<BR>provides clear reasons and contexts why certain kinds of myths <BR>were perpetuated/re-stated in NT documents. I am very familiar<BR>with the latter topic, but amazed that adherents of Christianity <BR>agree with the kinds of books I had read!<br />    Again doing a fine job of putting writings in the NT in their<BR>proper context, in Ch. 9, \\"Murder Mystery,\\" specifically p. 194,<BR>Mr. Shorto explains point blank why blaming the Jews as a race for <BR>killing Jesus is based on \\"fiction.\\" The reason is because whoever <BR>wrote this in Matthew could not blame the Romans, since they were <BR>living under the Roman Empire. Furthermore the writer(s) were <BR>themselves Jews, and surely had no clue that their words would be <BR>used for 2000 years to bear such malice against another religion!<br />    Another topic I most enjoyed was at the beginning of \\"Gospel<BR>Truth,\\" where the author discusses so well, that much of the<BR>study of Jesus has been to make Jesus into whatever you want him<BR>to be, e.g. a feminist, liberal, even gay Jesus! It is so true that<BR>people tend to project their own biases onto their beliefs.<br />    Yet from the contents of the book one gets the impression that<BR>the author doesn't understand why so many people question the<BR>tenets of literal NT Christianity. For example, he never mentions <BR>how many millions of people have perished at the hands of Christian <BR>persecutors. He concedes that indeed many people today are \\"gnostics,\\" <BR>trying to find their own truth about God, etc., but it seems to surprise <BR>him! I was frankly put off at what he writes about his experience <BR>of Christ's crucifixion at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre <BR>(p. 211) - his words seem to be saying that Christ is the only <BR>being who is eternal, and thus everyone else is not, that the<BR>experience one has at this site is the only \\"the\\" experience.	2004-02-22

A book of this quality deserves many reviews to encourage <BR>people to at least look at it. <br />    Particle physics is extremely abstruse, really only for physicists<BR>and people who like knowledge for its own sake. Many particle physicists <BR>do the best they can to explain their subject in &quot;English,&quot; but I don't <BR>think that laypeople (incl. myself) can really grasp the subject w/o <BR>going through the rigors of deriving its basics and knowing how<BR>to use its tools, like QED and QCD, etc. (and I don't!).<br />    So personally I may be moving away from studying the subject, but<BR>I'm very glad I came across &quot;The Particle Odyssey.&quot; They say a picture <BR>tells a thousand words - truer words could be spoken as concerns the <BR>book. The reader (even the peruser) can learn an incredible amount at <BR>whatever level he/she is at, just by looking at the pictures and reading <BR>the concise descriptions. We see pictures of the founders of modern physics, <BR>their inventions, also great shots of particle accelerators and particle <BR>tracks, and much more. The book would make a superb coffee-table addition. <BR>It could entertain, even blow the minds of people who looked at it, maybe <BR>spark some interest in younger people, and as I said, anyone can learn <BR>something at the same time (perhaps unlike a familar coffee table favorite, <BR>&quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;!). <br />    The text is about as easy to read, given the complicated subject, <BR>as possible, thorough, and enjoyable. Together with the pictures, the <BR>authors cover the subject (and I do feel qualified to say this) more<BR>than thoroughly.<br />    Anyone with even a passing interest in particle physics would do<BR>quite well to have this amazing, remarkable book.	2003-12-23

The author discusses the five <BR>strategies we have employed, the most important being &quot;drawdown,&quot; the <BR>mind-boggling rates of extraction and use of nonrenewable resources. Of <BR>course the major point of the book, as surely all who have heard about <BR>the book know, is that we are soon to hit what is widely being reported <BR>as &quot;peak oil.&quot; Actually we hit peak oil production in 1979, the author states, <BR>and now, between 2006 and 2015, we will reach the point where what he calls <BR>EROEI (energy returned on energy invested) will begin to decline precipitously. <BR>EROEI is perhaps the key concept in this discussion, because as we know, there<BR>will still be plenty of oil in the ground, the problem will be the exhorbitant<BR>cost to extract it, according to the author and the &quot;cassandras&quot; who<BR>support this point of view. The author uses the writings of many retired,<BR>former oil-company geologists to back up his conclusions.<br />    Mr. Heinberg then goes on to &quot;prove&quot; that not only is there not one<BR>or even a combination of alternative sources, either renewable or <BR>nonrenewable, to replace oil, that it would also take far too long to develop <BR>the necessary infrastructures. Thus we are &quot;hopelessly&quot; dependant on oil, <BR>and it is inevitable that we are going to have to scale back our useage<BR>of oil, reduce the population drastically (by 2/3's), and live in <BR>self-sufficient communities, relying on &quot;good pair of shoes and a sturdy <BR>bicycle&quot; (p. 149).<br />    &quot;The Party's Over&quot; is a great book to give to someone who is concerned<BR>and wants a basic understanding of the concerns of the book. I particularly <br />enjoyed Chapter 4, &quot;Non-Petroleum Energy Sources...&quot; The author demonstrates <BR>a solid knowledge of wind, hydrogen, solar, geothermal, and other power<BR>sources, though for someone already versed in these areas there isn't<BR>much new. Still, the writing style is consistently first rate, and many <BR>good references are provided for those who want the details (like me!).<BR>I also compliment the author on his even-handed style, devoid of the<BR>&quot;misanthropic invectives&quot; that some environmentalists seem to revel in!<BR> <BR>    Yet I must disagree with the author's conclusions, especially<BR>the &quot;fait accompli&quot; of the final chapters. I have been exposed to <BR>the kinds of predictions expressed in the book since the 1970's, and <BR>over and over (and over) I have watched prediction after prediction <BR>of this kind NOT come true. While I won't say I am a &quot;cornucopian,&quot; <BR>I simply do not believe that depleting energy resources is going to <BR>cause the scale of changes predicted here. Does anyone remember Y2K? <BR>I heard countless &quot;experts&quot; make countless predictions (I understood <BR>the computer aspect since I do that for a living), and as we all know, <BR>Y2K was a total non-event. Now, you might say, well, because of all <BR>the warnings, organizations got their acts together and solved the <BR>problem, whereas oil is nonrenewable and nothing can change that. <BR>I disagree. Y2K and other problems prove that there is something <BR>about the human spirit that we seem to be able to find solutions, <BR>regardless of how all-encompassing the problems are.<br />    If something is going to take civilization down it isn't <BR>energy. There are countless other possibilities - earth changes, <BR>nuclear war, consciousness shifts (or lack thereof!), take your <BR>pick, whichever insanity getting out of hand, but if we make it <BR>to peak oil, assuming the dates in the book are correct, we will <BR>find ways to survive, even thrive, in my opinion. And let's face <BR>it, the people who run the world may publicly show no concern, but <BR>they want to stay in control, and I feel certain they have already <BR>got solutions. And even if they don't, there are many brilliant <BR>scientists and environmentalists who can come up with answers if <BR>that becomes necessary, and as the author states at the bottom of <BR>p. 236 (I am twisting his words somewhat), if the masses really <BR>believe that there is an energy crisis and demand that it be solved.	2003-11-12
US	53062494	R83S13XEFXA52	1571742417	599330589	Otherwhere: A Field Guide to Nonphysical Reality for the Out-of-Body Traveler	Books	4	53	55	N	N	For the most part an excellent &quot;tour&quot; guide	I heard the author of &quot;OtherWhere&quot; on a paranormal-type radio show<BR>I listen to frequently. The host claimed that the book was a &quot;complete&quot;<BR>guide to the after-death world, which the author calls &quot;OtherWhere.&quot; <BR>For the most part I would agree.<br />    The author started having profound dreams and out-of-body experiences<BR>when he was young, and after a number of years, felt compelled to become<BR>a guide (on the physical plane!) for other humans, to help with <BR>understanding dreams, OBE's, and most importantly, what it means for <BR>humans to be souls having physical experiences, what we are supposed to <BR>learn from our temporary time in this world. <br />    I have mixed feelings about &quot;OtherWhere,&quot; but I want to say up front<BR>that I absolutely recommend that people read it. The author writes mostly <BR>with great clarity and insight, and through his personal experiences<BR>and &quot;visions&quot; (though of course you can't &quot;see&quot; on the other side),<BR>the reader can get a very good idea of a broad spectrum of both the<BR>dream world, the after-death world, and where the two diverge. The author's <BR>own learning of this last point is itself an interesting part of the book. <BR>The author also writes most engagingly about the types of beings who inhabit <BR>&quot;OtherWhere&quot; and aid souls, and what we can learn from their perspective. <BR>There are also some haunting, fascinating descriptions of the &quot;zones&quot;/planes <BR>we experience on the other side after death. The discussions of the Alternate <BR>Is, Was, and Will Be worlds are a most interesting take on the &quot;parallel <BR>universes&quot; idea!<br />    The chapter entitled &quot;The Evolution of Human Consciousness&quot; is<BR>really brilliant, a must read. The author has a very accessible <BR>experience where he comes to understand how an individual can have <BR>his own consciousness and yet be part of a larger consciousness by<BR>becoming a blade of grass in a world of grass blades! He later <BR>experiences the consciousness of a flower, then a bee, which itself <BR>is remarkable, but what is outstanding is what he learns and how he <BR>conveys his understandings to the reader. Also discussed very well<BR>are types of creativity, and how integral creativity is to soul<BR>development.<br />    Mr. Leland also shows great care in defining to the reader how<BR>he will present material that is difficult to put into words, with a<BR>minimum of bias. He devises &quot;translation tables&quot; and discusses his<BR>attempts to be as objective as possible very well. He insightfully <BR>distinguishes between the possible distortions he might project onto <BR>what he is &quot;seeing&quot; and the actual meaning or function. For example, <BR>the author transcends his fear when he comes into contact with a being <BR>who to many would look very frightening, but to the author he is simply <BR>a &quot;guide,&quot; because the being's function is to take the author to the <BR>other side. Also, he calls dead people &quot;Shades,&quot; an innocuous term, so <br />we will minimize our preconceptions, though it is important to note that <BR>many times we see how belief systems do literally &quot;shape&quot; much of the <BR>after-death sworld and the experiences of the departed.<br />    But the confusion between what the author is experiencing, which<BR>he writes correctly, many times, is based on his own biases which<BR>create the energies he perceives, and what we are to understand from his <BR>experiences, is the biggest problem with the book. In chapter 8 he explains<br />that he perceives &quot;creatures&quot; when he is repressing emotions in waking<BR>life. So are we to believe that everything else are &quot;clear perceptions,&quot;<BR>w/o biases? In chapter 9 again he isn't clear on what he is perceiving<BR>and what it means, so the same question arises, at least to me.<br />    As well the book onlylives up to the &quot;meaning of life&quot; claim in<BR>part. For most souls it certainly is very valuable to read the details <BR>of how we come to understand, dispassionately, impersonally, at the soul <BR>level, the lessons from our life's experiences, in &quot;OtherWhere.&quot; Yet <BR>personally I was looking for some deeper answers. I don't normally<BR>concern myself with *my* own soul's evolution. I care about things like<BR>why billions of seemingly decent people are born into wretched, hopeless <BR>depravity, while others are born into relative wealth, sometimes with<BR>no gratitude or mindfulness of others' suffering. On p. 261 (and<BR>elsewhere) the author falls into what I would call the &quot;absolutist&quot; trap, <BR>when he (his guide) writes, &quot;Resistance to learning is the source of all <BR>human suffering.&quot; I am generally averse to simplistic answers to explain <BR>&quot;all&quot; anything. Another &quot;meaning&quot; question that is not covered at all<BR>in &quot;OtherWhere&quot; is the question of evil. <br />    Ironically, Mr. Leland does admit (astonishingly) that none of his <BR>nonphysical guides knows about the lessons after &quot;graduating&quot; from the <BR>soul's need to reincarnate! And one repeatedly gets the impression from <BR>the book that few are ready to graduate, in contradistinction to the <BR>&quot;New Age&quot; teaching that we are already perfected beings!<br />    Let me repeat, there is much to recommend &quot;OtherWhere&quot; that I do <BR>not have space to discuss. My criticisms of the book do not diminish my <BR>recommending it. One final comment - if anyone reading this review has <BR>not read &quot;Journey of Souls&quot; by Dr. Michael Newton (some prefer his <BR>&quot;Destiny of Souls&quot;), I would advise him/her to read that book asap <BR>if interested in the topics covered in &quot;OtherWhere.&quot;	2003-09-06

The reader<br />reaps ample benefits of Mr. Vernon's total understanding of his<br />subject. He really &quot;groks&quot; the material, to use Heinlein's term from<br />&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land.&quot;<br />  An author writing about K doesn't have any room to err or miss<br />aspects of K's life. There have been many books written on the topic,<br />for example, Mary Lutyens comprehensive and insightful biographies<br />(I'd recommend the first two highly). And of course K himself wrote<br />many books. Yet Mr. Vernon somehow succeeds, in less than 300 pages,<br />in covering the entire topic of the background to K's discovery by<br />the Theosophical Society, then his being thrust, albeit gradually,<br />into the public as the &quot;World Teacher,&quot; to his break from theosophy,<br />and establishing himself, on his own terms, as a world teacher, and<br />the author is almost always dead on in his discussions of the<br />teachings themselves.<br />  Mr. Vernon starts the book with the very famous sighting of K<br />on a beach in Adyar, India, by the world-renown but controversial<br />psychic C.W. Leadbetter, and gives a great description of the latter's<br />viewing of the advanced &quot;soul&quot; of the apparently outwardly &quot;stupid&quot;<br />Brahmin boy, and Leadbetter's careful consideration that indeed he<br />has identified the &quot;chosen one.&quot; Following is a fine historical<br />overview of the Theosophical Society's (TS) beginnings (or perhaps<br />resurrection) in 1875, by Blavatsky and Olcott. Next we read about<br />Annie Besant and Leadbetter, Blavatsky's successors, who believe<br />that theosophy has a destiny to bring to the world a Christ, a World<br />Teacher. While the author becomes very critical of Besant later in<br />the book, deservedly so it would seem, he very much honors her amazing<br />courage and achievements (pp. 18-19, etc.) prior to her becoming a<br />&quot;priestess&quot; for the &quot;New Age.&quot;<br />  The rest of the book is totally consistent with the above -<br />complete and insightful. Many very complicated topics are handled<br />with amazing balance. Three examples are 1) K's gradual decision<br />to break with his &quot;Amma,&quot; Annie Besant, and how she, Leadbetter, and<br />the TS handle this &quot;betrayal&quot; - and yet after leaving the TS K<br />might have become the exact &quot;flowering&quot; of theosophy its founders<br />envisioned!; 2) K's relations with many people as a very flawed<br />personality, vs. his amazing presence in his role as a teacher, and<br />the power of his simple, direct teachings; 3) the problem of using<br />word symbols to convey teachings that are beyond words. On p. 260<br />(and elsewhere) with great skill he shows that while K's teachings<br />are contradictory if followed to the letter, the solution is simply<br />to accept them at whatever level works for a person, as millions have<br />done. Personally I have met people who over-analyse K's teachings,<br />and worry more about how aware they are than simply being, which is<br />perhaps the main point in the first place!<br />  Yet another example of the author's acumen is his fine analysis<br />of K's teachings and their impact (pp. 213-5), followed by a<br />proper quoting of K himself on the core of the teaching (pp. 216-7).<br />Then the author recommends and discusses the book &quot;Freedom From<br />the Known&quot; so that the reader can delve into the topic him or<br />herself.<br />  If there is abetter book that covers the background, life, and<br />teachings of Krishnamurti better than &quot;Star in the East,&quot; I would<br />certainly like to know about it!<BR>teachings of Krishnamurti better than &quot;Star in the East,&quot; I would <BR>certainly like to know about it!	2003-07-18

I <BR>only recently got around to reading the book, which I was <BR>interested in because, indeed, I very much buy into conspiracy<BR>theories. Based on the interview, in which she claimed to have<BR>been harrassed by Skull and Bones (SaB) members, a claim <BR>repeated at the outset of the book, I expected a full expose'<BR>of Skull and Bones.<br />    While the book does provide an expose', about 80% of the<BR>writing that provides background about the so-called Yale<BR>(and Harvard) \\"mystique,\\" along with staggering amounts of details<BR>about the goings on at Yale, bored me no end, and I found myself<BR>skimming constantly. By the time I got to page 100, half-way<BR>through, I simply could not believe that an editor didn't make<BR>drastic cuts/changes to the contents of the book. It's easy to <BR>understand why the author would be interested in all this \\"gossip,\\"<BR>for she was a member of another secret society at Yale, she was<BR>\\"in\\" as she wrote. Maybe the editors were too. I can't imagine<BR>who else would want to read this material, except perhaps in brief<BR>outline as background.<BR> <BR>    Here are some examples. The first 3 pages of Chapter 3, \\"Inside<BR>Headquarters,\\" is a very boring poem called \\"The Brown Jug.\\" Pp. 104 -<BR>106 is yet another soporific excerpt from a novel about \\"Tap Day,\\" which<BR>the author describes in great detail in not one, but two sections of the<BR>book. On p. 130 we are treated to SaB's dinner menu - the chapter is <BR>called \\"The Secrets of the Skull and Bones!\\" Further, she often cites <BR>one reference, and then confusingly goes back in time to use another <BR>(at times) long, questionable citation. On p. 204 she engages in many lines <BR>of name dropping that have absolutely nothing to do with Yale or Skull and <BR>Bones!<br />    On the bright side, Chapter 6, \\"The Network,\\" is very good, well worth<BR>reading, a bold, thorough expose' of the way the members of Skull and Bones <BR>have helped each other out through the years, with ample details of the<BR>Bush family and their connections with the Harrimans and others. Another<BR>topic the book covers well is the incredible obsession that members of<BR>these societies have with rituals (see David Icke's books, for sure!).<br />    At the end of \\"Secrets of the Tomb\\" the author clearly accepts the<BR>info she got from \\"insiders,\\" that they have \\"planted\\" most of what <br />conspiracy researchers have written as \\"truth\\" about Skull and Bones. In<BR>one sentence (p. 188) she refutes what I feel are very well-documented <BR>connections between SaB members and the Nazi's (see my review of a biography <BR>of G. Bush), and how can anyone deny that the government prosecuted these <BR>people? I can only conclude that it's a shame that so much effort was spent <BR>on many unimportant pages about the goings on at Yale and relatively few <BR>pages on the more important actions of the members of these secret societies.	2003-05-30
US	53062494	R1D2RL4EDE4W7N	1932047921	227701166	Earth's Future Climate	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Short but great overview of climate change	I heard Mr. Willis on a talk show a couple of months ago. The<BR>host, who himself had co-authored a book on rapid climate change, <BR>claimed that by reading \\"Earth's Future Climate\\" in a \\"couple of hours,\\" <BR>one could become fairly well acquainted with the subject. I got the book,<BR>and while I don't exactly agree that it only takes a few hours, I absolutely <BR>concur that this short, highly-readable book, is an excellent overview of <BR>the very complex subject of climate change and prediction. Indeed it does <BR>only take a few hours to read, but I had a very limited background on many <BR>of the subjects covered, so I've read it about 3 times. After the third read <BR>I feel that I indeed have a decent overview. The author covers quite a <BR>bit of material in each of the short chapters, yet succinctly, and writes <BR>in a very friendly manner, wanting the reader to \\"get it,\\" despite the many <BR>complexities. And most importantly, he seems to back up <BR>all of his contentions with good science.<br /> Mr. Willis' main contention is that while we are in a warming period,<BR>it is not due to mankind's increasing use of greenhouse gases. He posits<BR>that the earth's climate goes in cycles of mostly ice ages, followed by warmer <BR>cycles. In fact we are on the rebound of what is known as \\"The Little Ice Age,\\"<BR>which occurred after another cycle of warm temperatures before the Renaissance. <BR>This cold cycle, along with devastating diseases, ravaged the earth's population, <BR>and ended around 1900. Mr Willis traces many rounds of Ice Ages and warming <BR>periods, going back thousands and millions of years, using ice cores, which he <BR>calls \\"time machines\\" (Ch. 17, very interesting). Analysing the chemical content <BR>(using oxygen) of ice cores tell scientists very much about what the earth's climate <BR>is at a given time. <br /> What causes these cycles? Well, prior to the Industrial Revolution <BR>mankind couldn't have been a cause, so what he claimsis that the cycles<BR>have to do with sunspot cycles, which come in 11-year cycles themselves,<BR>but their effect is in fact more pronounced during the height of the Gleibsser <BR>Period (70-90 years). We are in a period of rapid global warming now (c. 2002) <BR>because we are at the height of a Gleibsser Period. There are also interesting <BR>discussions of much larger cycles, like the Milankovich cycle.<br /> One of themes of the book is that \\"correlation is not causation.\\" The<BR>author feels that even though there are undoubted signs of global warming <BR>(GW), the correlation between increased greenhouse gases and GW is simply <BR>not proven scientifically. On p. 110 a \\"meticulously conducted study by two <BR>Danish scientists\\" is cited, which claims with a \\"probability of 84.6%\\" that<BR>GW is caused by sunspot cycles. This of course flatly contradicts the web <BR>site of the Union of Concerned Scientists, one of his references: \\"the warming <BR>effect due to increases of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is estimated to <BR>be more than 8 times greater than the effect of solar irradiance.\\" I guess each <BR>will have to make up his/her own mind! Personally I found the author's <BR>explication of vast cycles of cold and warm cycles predating the Industrial <BR>Revolution to be surprisingly convincing.<br /> The other major contention of \\"Earth's Future Climate\\" is that global<BR>climate change happens very rapidly, in as little as ten years, from relatively <BR>stable times. While the author does agree that global warming is a fact, he thinks that <BR>because GW might cause changes in the Atlantic ocean currents, we could actually<BR>enter another ice age! The explantion is not simple, but the writing<BR>is interesting and clear. Specifically, in Ch. 18, \\"Gyres,\\" the <BR>discussion in on Atlantic Ocean currents, which <BR>contain \\"thermohaline sinks,\\" where cold, salty water sinks down<BR>in tremendous volume, causing the currents (by wind) to circulate warmair. <BR>Because there is more rainfall with GW, the salinity of the sinking water is<BR>decreasing, which could disrupt the warming. Also, while some of the world's <BR>glaciers are melting, because of increased rainfall this melting might be <BR>counterbalanced by more accumulation of ice!<br /> What makes the entire topic so complicated is that there are countless<BR>factors that affect climate in one way or another, which cause other<BR>things to happen, while of course the earth itself tries to re-balance<BR>all these competing factors. In fact on p. 37 the author contends that<BR>the system is so chaotic it is simply not predictable, even with the<BR>best of computer models.<br /> I've written a lot already, but I realize that this short book covers<BR>many times more than what I've tried to summarize here. It also includes<BR>a very good glossary, and you can scan in the bibliography as text, which <BR>is mostly web sites, and have some fun looking around the Internet. I did find that <BR>some of the URL's no longer exist or I had to search a given site to find the new URL.<br /> A small fault with the book was that unless I read it very<BR>carefully, I wasn't sure whether Mr. Willis was promoting his own<BR>views or the views of scientists who claim that humanity's use of<BR>fossil fuels is having a huge impact on global climate, with whom he <BR>does not agree.<br /> I very highly recommend this primer on global climate change to those<BR>with limited time and background, but concern!	2003-03-31
US	53062494	R2TJGTI49HRDHQ	0943235057	307542132	George Bush the Unauthorized Biography (Illus)	Books	4	76	86	N	N	Incredible expose' of 20th Cent. oligarchy; too opinionated	This unauthorized biography of the Bush family, really the <BR>Bush-Harriman-Rockefeller, etc., establishment, is from what I know<BR>by far the best expose' of the way the US-UK governments have<BR>been pretty much taken over by these rich, powerful families and their<BR>networks, which encompass and pervade the entire spectrum of government,<BR>intelligence, corporations; in short, just about every aspect of society.<BR>Certainly that is why the book is out of print, exceedingly [costly]<BR>to obtain, but ... it is possible<BR>to download it by searching the Internet.<br />The book is timeless and timely in the sense that no one can <BR>understand the groups who are behind our leaders w/o knowing the<BR>persons and organizations who run the world overtly and covertly, and <BR>their history. (A relatively short book that can provide a worthy <BR>backdrop for this study is \\"The Anglo-American Establishment,\\" by Prof. <BR>Carroll Quigley). It is really an understatement to say that this tome <BR>provides names and details I doubt you will find anywhere else. You may <BR>have read \\"sound bytes\\" about some of the topics covered, and sundry <BR>unsubstantiated allegations of this or that, but in these 600+ pages <BR>you get, for the most part, the cold, hard facts. <br /> The chapters covering the elitist residents of Jupiter Island, FL, <BR>the extensive (Prescott) Bush-Harriman dealings with the Nazis (to the <BR>point of even helping to defeat their opposition), Skull and Bones <BR>(a Who's Who of prominent leaders since its inception in 1833), Watergate, <BR>Iran-Contra, the Savings and Loan collapse and bailout, and more, are <BR>so well-researched, thorough, coherent, and full of key events, names, and <BR>dates it boggles the mind, and it's hard to overdo praising the authors <BR>for their exacting, painstaking research. I've read many books that<BR>try to discuss maybe one or two of the topics discussed in this biography,<BR>but do little more than present a maze of data that confuses more than<BR>clarifies. The authors write with what seems to be first-hand, insider<BR>knowledege, and indeed to the point the father of one of the authors was <BR>a lawyer who fought the Bush-Harriman (along with the Warburg banking <BR>family) support for Hitler prior to WWII.<br /> People who reject ...a theory a priori would be faced with a<BR>monumental challenge to refute at least most of this biography. In <BR>tracing George Bush's multi-faceted, long career in public life, his<BR>initial losses running for Congress followed by later successes in<BR>obtaining elected and unelected positions, the authors also demonstrate <BR>very convincingly that behind the scenes there often is practically no <BR>difference between Republicans and Democrats, and that what obviously <BR>counts is to realize who or what has the real power and is thus making <BR>the crucial decisions and pulling the strings.<br /> My one complaint about the authors is their one-pointed agenda to find <BR>nothing but negative things to say about Bush. It was clear why: they <BR>were (and still are) associates of Lyndon LaRouche, a tireless foe of <BR>Bush, whom the latter had imprisoned shortly after he became President in<BR>1989. Also, the book was written shortly before Bush ran for reelection <BR>in 1992, and they wanted to help defeat Bush. But I felt that they made <BR>too much of Bush's hyperthyroidism, his so-called liberalism (which I <BR>could only rarely follow), and found every opportunity to critize his <BR>gaffs, frenetic activity, and emotional outbursts, while finding nothing <BR>to laud. To me the book would have been \\"perfect\\" had they just stuck <BR>with providing the extraordinary amount of details on Bush and the other <BR>controlling persons/entities. Still, this unauthorized biography is a <BR>classic for history buffs, absolutely a must-read to understand the <BR>politics of the 20th century, and surely even what is going on even <BR>today. In factas I write this review there have been widely read <BR>articles in mainstream publications about the \\"new\\" (Anglo-)American <BR>empire!	2003-01-20

With the Internet was supposed to come<BR>the \\"New Age\\" of truth, understanding, etc. Yet it seems like a dark<BR>time, and an aware person has to live in many different worlds to try <BR>to see what is going on. <br />    Yes, it seems dark now, and in one world we get the official<BR>version of what happened on 9/11, that 19 Arab hijackers, led by<BR>Osama bin Laden, who did the organization from some caves, etc., in<BR>Afghanistan, orchestrated an unbelievably well-organized hijacking<BR>and destruction, which led to the deaths of thousands of people. In<BR>the \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" world, we get page after page of an <BR>incredible expose' of staggering corruption at the highest levels, <BR>point by point \\"destruction\\" of the official story, revealing countless <BR>inconsistencies in what we have been told, which would make even the<BR>most skeptical person question the official version of the incidents on <BR>9/11 and in the days afterward. <br />    \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" documents so many aspects of 9/11 that my <BR>notes are so full of points I marked with an \\"*,\\" to be mentioned<BR>in this review, that I gave up! But as other reviewers have noted, \\"Alice<BR>In Wonderland\\" also presents the \\"big picture,\\" the much larger <BR>background that a serious person needs to become familiar with to <BR>see why Icke may be right. And as I wrote in my review of \\"Children of <BR>the Matrix,\\" I must sadly admit that at the level I operate at I simply <br />cannot say whether he is correct.<br />    Here are only a few of the hundreds of salient points made so well:<br />    1) p. 74 (and elsewhere) - FBI investigations of bin Laden ties with <BR>Saudi Arabia (and guess who else?) were blocked by the higher ups. The<BR>FBI director resigned, was security head at the WTC, and died on 9/11.<br />    2) p. 149 on - full exposes of scams like the OKC bombing, Pearl <BR>Harbor, and Operation Northwoods (p. 336). The latter was a Pentagon <br />plan in the 1960's to frame Castro, to make it look like the Cubans <BR>were killing American citizens while others were committing the acts. <BR>Included in these documented plans were the hijackings of civilian<BR>planes (p. 165)! Also p. 336 on, discussion of what is publicly known <BR>about advanced capabilities of controlling planes by remote control,<BR>a key part of Icke's suggested explanation for part of what really<BR>happened on 9/11.<br />    3) p. 171 - of the four planes involved in 9/11, NOT ONE PLANE <br />activated the 4-digit code that tells air traffic control that it had<BR>been hijacked.<br />    4) Ch. 8, \\"House of Cards,\\" presents mind-boggling questions <BR>about supposed lack of communication between the FAA and NORAD, <BR>incl. allowing Flight 11 to fly around for about 45 minutes after it<BR>was known that it had been hijacked. When jets were finally scrambled,<BR>they were sent not from Andrews AFB, near DC, but rather from Langley,<BR>130 miles away! No surprise, they got to the scene late.<BR> <BR>    5) Ch. 10 \\"The hijackers\\" <BR>    p. 268 - the incredible precision required to fly a plane into a<BR>section of the Pentagon, vs. claims of instructors that the purported<BR>pilots of Flight 11 were \\"Dumb and Dumber!\\"<BR>    Also throughout, at least 7 of the 19 \\"hijackers\\" are still alive?!<br />    6) Finally, the overall question - has the proof been presented <BR>publicly that bin Laden and company did the hijackings? According to <BR>the book, they have it, but it is \\"classified!\\"<br />    I could on for pages listing the clear expositions detailed in the<BR>book, but you can't do much in this limited space.<br />    On the last page of the book Icke makes a somewhat startling<BR>statement, that this is his last \\"conspiracy\\" book, that he will<BR>be moving on to \\"I am,\\" helping to build a new model to make the old<BR>one obsolete. I and others surely wish him the best of luck, and I<BR>am very grateful for what I've learned in his books. Andwhat courage!	2002-12-29
US	53062494	R2SGXZXHXPDDC7	1571780300	63363770	Dead Sea Scrolls: The Untold Story	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Great overview of the DSS; some overstatements	I heard Dr. Hanson both times he has been on the well-known<BR>(inter)national talk radio show, \\"Coast to Coast,\\" though he was <BR>never interviewed by the show's mainstay, Art Bell. Dr. Hanson is a <BR>very competent and highly enthusiastic speaker. On the show and <BR>certainly in \\"The Untold Story\\" he adds life to what could be a<BR>\\"dead\\" subject. He is the rare Christian, not in that he accepts <BR>Judaism as the undoubted precursor to Christianity (a point<BR>fully proven by the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS), according to him), but <BR>he knows Hebrew fluently from years of study, and more importantly, <BR>having lived in Israel for many years, and not always in the safest <BR>places! You feel his deep love for religious studies in the book,<BR>and his sincere, humble conviction for the religious path.<br />    On the radio and in the Introduction of the book Dr. Hanson<BR>promises to tell the DSS saga to non-scholars, without the verbose<BR>and dry prose of the many scholarly but unfulfilling tomes that have <BR>been produced since the remarkable discovery of the scrolls in 1947, <BR>amazingly synchronistic with the founding of the modern state of Israel.<BR>For the most part Dr. Hanson succeeds very well, giving a very clear,<BR>thorough, lively, and from what I know, factual account of the finding,<BR>history, and meaning of the DSS - all this in relatively few pages. I <BR>think that even those (non-experts) who are familiar with the story will <BR>find Dr. Hanson's account enjoyable reading.<br />    Another aspect of the DSS that Dr. Hanson's covers admirably are<BR>the many controversies surrouding the scrolls, and he explains why the<BR>scholarly consensus is usually to him the most plausible. For example, <BR>most scholars think that the authors and creators of the scrolls were<BR>Essenes, but some feel that this is not the case. Dr. Hanson not<BR>only shows why the philosophy and lifestyle(s) of the various Essene<BR>sects point to the Essenes, but on p. 61 he cleverly speculates that<BR>the Hebrew word Osin, which means \\"doers of God's will,\\" could have<BR>been \\"corrupted\\" to form \\"Essenes,\\" who most certainly consider<BR>themselves doers of God's will.<br />    I much appreciated Dr. Hanson's extensive use of Josephus'<BR>writings, for example discussing John the Baptist, as well as the<BR>Romans account of the almost total annihilation of the Jews in Israel<BR>by the Kittim (DSS term for \\"the dark forces\\") in the late 60's AD. <BR>Finally, I also enjoyed Dr. Hanson's contention that Jesus himself <BR>must have known about the DSS, and while he might have been the Messiah <BR>the scrolls predicted, he constantly drew a distinction between their <BR>extreme positions and disciplines and his more lenient, compassionate<BR>teachings. (I will assume Jesus existed for this discussion).<br />    Yet parts of the book were a little troublesome for me, and these<BR>were always Dr. Hanson's commentaries (as opposed to his always<BR>lucid accounts of the details of scrolls-related topics). Indeed<BR>he quotes Josephus extensively for interesting historical context, <BR>and even states that Josephus was a contemporary of Jesus, yet he <BR>says not one word as to why there is maybe only 1 brief \\"legitimate\\"<BR>reference in Josephus to Jesus, when according to the author, Jesus' <BR>miracles, predicted by the DSS, were perhaps the most essential aspect <BR>proving his being the Messiah! One would think that anyone who did <BR>such things would be mentioned in detailed volumes in more than a <BR>very passing way.<br />    On p. 92 the cruel King Aristobolus dies after a short reign,<BR>it is as if \\"divine judgement,\\" but when there is a severe earthquake <BR>in 31 B.C., that greatly affects the DSS community, there is no<BR>\\"Godly\\" (my words) reason. Perhaps the Essenes and the author need <BR>some background in science! And on p. 116 there is a paragraph<BR>that stunned me given the quality of most of the book. Dr. Hanson<BR>claims that through the Jewish ritual, the \\"Bar Mitzvah,\\" the 13-year <BR>old \\"son of the Most High,\\" bypasses adolescence. Having gone through a<BR>serious preparation of quite a bit of Hebrew and Torah reading myself<BR>at that age, I can assure the author that the \\"High\\" was only very, very<BR>temporary, and I went through my puberty like everyone else!<br />    Whatever its faults, I still highly recommend \\"The Untold Story\\" for <BR>a great overview and fine insights into the many aspects the Dead Sea <BR>Scrolls.	2002-10-31
US	53062494	R20HY5NA04FB86	0743224574	87039745	A Beautiful Mind: The Life of Mathematical Genius and Nobel Laureate John Nash	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Might really be for academics - movie complements it well	Like many other reviewers, I only read \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" (ABM) because <BR>of the outstanding movie that very much deserved the awards it won this past<BR>year. After reading the book I have even more praise for the choices the<BR>creators of the movie had to make to condense John Nash's story into a<BR>couple of hours. The movie is serious and thoughtful, for sure, but the real<BR>story of the Nash family makes the movie seem almost tame. <br />    I do not think that a book of this scope can be fairly judged in one<BR>reading, which is why I felt I had to read it twice before writing a review. Overall <BR>ABM is very well written, more than complete, thoroughly researched, compelling, and<BR>interesting historically. ABM also contains many interesting, relevant references to <BR>other books, has poignant quotes from great thinkers like Nietzsche (start of Ch. 17), <BR>and excels when the author uses fictional works by authors like Kafka (\\"The <BR>Trial,\\" etc.) to illustrate Nash's dilemmas. <br />    It is difficult, for me at least, to separate my reaction to the book from my <BR>reaction to Nash's personality. I found myself getting very angry at parts of <BR>Nash's \\"inconsistent\\" personality. One of the best examples can be found on p. 114. <BR>In one paragraph a prominent mathematician \\"frequently told others that Nash had<BR>greater insight into mathematical structure than any mathematician he had<BR>ever known,\\" while the last paragraph begins, \\"Some people found Nash absurdly <br />childish.\\" Over and over we read how Nash is the rare genius who sees the whole<BR>picture, but arrogant in the extreme, and apparently would often have nothing to do <BR>with people whom he does not judge to be at his level. He also wants to be an <BR>academician, but from what I remember is considered a very poor, unfair teacher <BR>in every reference in the book. He fathers a child with a woman whom he does not <BR>marry, and then at least twice she has to force him legally to pay child support. <br />Ms. Nasar seems to alternate between hero worship (I so tired of reading the <BR>overly detailed descriptions of the afternoon teas at Princeton) and tearing her <BR>hero down, to pieces. Instead of telling us about Nash's faults so often I wish <BR>she had consulted with someone who really understands Nash's vast contributions and <BR>written chapters detailing those - even if some equations had to be presented. She <BR>offers many examples of why Nash surely deserves to win the Nobel Peace Prize, <br />including numerous compliments by sundry academicians, but again often w/o adequate <BR>details. The discussion of game theory, von Neumann's version vs. Nash's, is explained <BR>well in the prologue, and chapters 9 and 10. Yet I wish she had given one concrete <BR>example of the \\"Nash equilibrium\\" - perhaps the FCC auction discussed in Ch. 49 was, <BR>but it is not so stated. <br />    I also compliment the author on her well-researched, balanced discussion of not <BR>only Nash's schizophrenia but on many aspects of mental illness. From what I know <BR>about the subject she covers the topic well, and indeed shows how, like the movie<BR>depicts, Nash's recovery (remission?) is remarkable. For what it's worth, like <BR>Nash, I also have a connection with Roanoke, VA, and mental illness.<br />    If there is a hero in the Nash story, it is undoubtedly his wife, Alicia,<BR>to whom the book is dedicated. Mrs. Nash, a former physics student at MIT who <BR>thinks she has a bright future with a handsome, outstanding mathematician (the book<BR>says \\"a genius with a ...\\"), finds herself in a horrible predicament: close<BR>to giving birth to her first child, her husband goes almost completely crazy<BR>in a period of a few months. Though Nash's fellow mathematicians repeatedly<BR>try to find him suitable work, even in the worst periods of his sickness, Alicia<BR>carries the burden of dealing with Nash on a daily basis (other than their<BR>separations), cares for their child (who very sadly ends up suffering from a <BR>worse case of schizophrenia than his father!), and supports the family financially <BR>at the same time. When Nash is suffering through the lowest point in his illness, <BR>c. 1970, with no one else to turn to, Alicia takes him in as a \\"boarder\\" (she had <BR>divorced him years before), and provides him a stress-free life so that he can at <BR>least try to work out his problems. If Nash does indeed recover it is Alicia who <BR>deserves much of the credit. I don't think that the speech in the movie actually <BR>happened, where Nash, upon receiving the Nobel, gives his wife the credit for <BR>being his salvation,  but it is certainly true to the story in the book. And I <BR>remember Jennifer Connelly saying similar words about Mrs. Nash's <BR>inspiration in her acceptance speech at the Oscar's.<br />    I do recommend \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" the movie and the book, but please have<BR>patience and skim where you feel you must!	2002-08-15
US	53062494	R2Q31PYE89YICF	015100398X	358137661	The Hole in the Universe: How Scientists Peered over the Edge of Emptiness and Found Everything	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Great science book for the layperson	&quot;A Hole In The Universe&quot; is certainly not a book for everyone. <BR>Obviously it is for ordinary, intelligent people who are interested in <BR>the latest developments and &quot;breakthroughs&quot; (quotes because who knows if <BR>they are correct) in physics, but it is most certainly not for physics <BR>majors or even physics minors. Therefore I much appreciated the reviewers <BR>who provided their backgrounds, particularly the person who said that he (?) <BR>was already familiar with the latest concepts in physics, and that this <BR>book was not for such a person. I will say that I am not very familiar with <BR>a lot of modern physics, though I have read a lot on quantum physics and the <BR>supposed parallels with metaphysics. I have not studied relativity and E-mc2 <BR>quite enough to understand them, but this book helps a lot, at least with<BR>the latter.<br />    Overall I would give Ms. Cole a great deal of credit and appreciation<BR>for very clear, intuitive, even profound explanations of most of the topics <BR>covered in the book. She takes on some very hard concepts and makes <BR>them as understandable as just about any book on physics for the <BR>layperson I've read. As other reviewers have written, at times her <BR>fragmented writing style is annoying, but to me only when I don't care<BR>for the topic she is discussing, most particularly string theory. Yet <BR>the problem might not be with her explanations, but rather with anyone <BR>attempting to explain subjects that must require a multitude of assumptions <BR>and math that even Ph.D.'s would balk at to comprehend! I give the author<BR>a lot of credit for trying to teach the reader to do a kind of spatial <BR>thinking required to see the &quot;whole,&quot; by which I mean that science cannot <BR>stand alone, verified only by mathematical equations of &quot;objective&quot; reality. <BR>Clearly the reality of sub-atomic physics, for example, is weird and often <BR>inexplicable anyway.<br />    Ms.Cole lays a marvelous foundation for discussing how nothing has<br />become certain stage in particle physics. In the first chapter she<BR>tries to get the reader simply to ponder what nothing is. Nothing<BR>might be the number 0, or the supposed missing matter related to big<BR>bang cosmology, or the missing neutrinos from the sun, or even the potential <BR>force of gravity in motionless objects. Nothing is also the fact that all <BR>properties of matter emanate from &quot;nothing,&quot; which as she explains quite well <BR>throughout the book is the &quot;resurrection&quot; of the ether, which is called the <BR>quantum vacuum today. In this excellent first chapter and later the author <BR>reaffirms the unmistakeable parallels between the &quot;nothing&quot; in physics and the <BR>no-thing in Eastern religions like Buddhism, the idea that mystics perceive <BR>the ground that underlies all being, and that a person who wants to advance <BR>spiritually (and maybe in contemporary physics) must verse him/herself in the <BR>void to be open/aware of the big picture. This first chapter alone is like <BR>a book in itself becase of its wealth of ideas. <br />    My other favorite chapter by far is Chapter 4, &quot;Nothing Takes<BR>Center Stage.&quot; We learn that what was proven by Faraday and further<BR>substantiated by Einstein and other physicists is that nothing, the<BR>vaccum, spacetime, etc,, along with the fields that emanated from<BR>this nothing, is (to physics) *the* reality. One of the topic headings<BR>in this chapter is &quot;Matter As Metaphor&quot; - again, what counts is not<BR>particles but rather the fields that emanate from the particles and<BR>the spaces between them. I totally enjoyed her explanation of the<BR>particle-antiparticle phenomenom, which I had read before but didn't <BR>understand. On p. 82 is an excellent diagram of P. Dirac's explanation <BR>of how when a particle is created from nothing (the vacuum), there is <BR>a hole (anti-particle) created at the same time. When these two entities<BR>collide they destroy each other, given by E = 2 * mc2, since there<BR>are 2 particles. I feel Einstein's famous equation can be understood<BR>quite well from a careful read of this chapter.<br />    As I mentioned above I did not care for the chapter(s) on string<BR>theory. I cannot grasp the value of strings, which make protons look<BR>like planets (or larger), and exist in at least eleven dimensions.<BR>Until I do further reading on this topic I must wonder if physicists <BR>have taken the amazing discoveries of quantum physics too far in their <BR>reductionist quest for the ultimate &quot;nothing.&quot; And the author herself<BR>states that there is no one ground in current string theory.<BR> <BR>    The short bios and bibliography at the end are very commendable<BR>points to recommend the book, and show that the author has made a <BR>gallant attempt to summarize an amazing variety of books on physics <BR>and other disciplines that (she believes) are related to the topics <BR>she discusses.<br />    I really look forward to reading at least 3 books from the <BR>bibliogrpahy and returning to &quot;A Hole In The Universe&quot; to<BR>see how well the author aided my understanding of these topics.	2002-04-24

After all,<BR>it might make them question their reality, it might knock them a bit<BR>out of their comfort zones. You can hear them saying, \\"why, that can't<BR>be possible, these kinds of crimes couldn't be covered up.\\" Thus<BR>conspiracy researchers have to present an enormous amount of documentation<BR>to be given any credibility at all. Yet once again, Dr.Horowitz is more<BR>than up to this challenge.<br />    Dr. Horowitz has contended for years that the main agenda of the<BR>globalists, the New World Order crowd, is to reduce the population of<BR>the planet by as much as 50%, and make money off of it at the same time. <BR>Referring to fellow conspiracy researcher David Icke, Horowitz discusses<BR>the NWO agenda in terms of the Hegelian dialectic, which is the<BR>thesis/anti-thesis/synthesis accounting for history's evolution. In<BR>today's world this is better termed \\"problem-reaction-solution.\\" That is,<BR>the people in power create a problem, which causes the public to demand<BR>action, at which point the NWO rolls out their already conceived<BR>\\"solution.\\"<br />    The sub-title of \\"Death In The Air\\" provides a good foundation <BR>to summarize this long, but highly readable, incredibly well-documented<BR>book: \\"Globalism, Terrorism, & Toxic Warfare.\\" The globalists are of<BR>course the money masters - Dr. Horowitz focuses on the Rockefellers,<BR>who have clearly wielded enormous power, owning many of the largest<BR>oil companies, but also either serving in government themselves, or<BR>putting cronies like Henry Kissinger into the seats of power in both<BR>government and business.<br />    As for terrorism, Dr. Horowitz provides numerous examples of<BR>intentional testing of chemical and biological substances on peoples<BR>throughout the world. He always names names, and provides precise<BR>dates and locations. For example, on p. 81 he discusses how the<BR>CIA-funded Evergreen Helicopters sprayed millions of gallons of<BR>chemicals both in the US and abroad. This form of government-sponsored<BR>terrorism is often directed at minorities, and many Native Americans<BR>in Arizona became seriously ill due to these intrusuions.<br />    Another example of terrorism (and toxic warfare) thoroughly<BR>documented in \\"Death In The Air\\" are the two infamous CIA mind-control<BR>projects, MKULTRA and MKNAOMI. It is widely known that former Nazis were<BR>brought to the US, having received no punishment for their heinous crimes,<BR>to teach US intelligence officials the techniques they learned from their<BR>torturings.<br />    By far the bulk of \\"Death In The Air\\" is devoted to exposing the<BR>NWO's toxic warfare campaign, ironically often termed \\"non-lethal\\"<BR>only because that term actually means that \\"only\\" a smaller percentage <BR>of death than \\"lethal\\" warfare occurs! Never mind the harm done. And<BR>what Dr. Horowitz does better than any researcher I have ever read is <BR>that he presents the best evidence of all when trying to prove that<BR>viruses and diseases like AIDS are no accident at all: he prints the<BR>actual contracts and other documents in black and white (you might need <BR>some reading glasses though!), which show as clearly as possible <BR>that companies have been paid to create diseases! While some might <BR>claim that these contracts are only circumstantial evidence, it is <BR>impossible, at least for me, to believe that contracts which precede <BR>the outbreaks of diseases are just \\"accidents.\\" As well Dr. Horowitz <BR>often provides excellent links between documentation and the actual <BR>onset of medical disasters.<br />    I am only scratching the surface of the vast wealth of topics<BR>discussed in \\"Death In The Air.\\" Others worth mentioning are HAARP<BR>and other electromagetic devices, Tesla technologies, West Nile Virus,<BR>vaccinations, and DNA as a frequency generator itself. I do not totally<BR>agree with Dr. Horowitz's tying the NWO to the Biblical apocalypse, but<BR>I must admit that his discussion of vaccinations, Kissinger, and 666,<BR>is credible.<br />    I more than highly recommend this very clear, well-written,<BR>amazing compilation!	2002-03-19
US	53062494	R2W271UEDY2C1	0953881016	571638377	Children of the Matrix: How an Interdimensional Race has Controlled the World for Thousands of Years-and Still Does	Books	5	12	13	N	Y	Icke does it again!	The first book I read by David Icke was called &quot;Robot's Rebellion,&quot;<BR>in which among other things he talked about themes he has developed<BR>in far greater detail since that book. The most salient theme in my<BR>view is that we are controlled, programmed, like robots, by the <BR>&quot;controllers,&quot; the conspiracy, whatever you want to call it, the people<BR>who really run the show in this crazy world. One point that struck<BR>me from &quot;Robot's Rebellion,&quot; and his next book, &quot;And The Truth Shall<br />Set You Free,&quot; is that not only are we controlled on a physical level, but <BR>perhaps more powerfully, we are controlled by some &quot;interdimensional,&quot; <BR>lower astral force, that deceives us into thinking that we are powerless<BR>physical beings. Let me say that the &quot;And The Truth...&quot; is maybe the best <BR>conspiracy book I've read.<br />    &quot;Children of the Matrix&quot; follows these same themes, but is a<BR>quantum leap in the level and amount of material Icke presents the<BR>reader. One of the many themes in this book, really the starting point,<BR>is the author's view that, just as the movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; depicts, <BR>we live in a world which is a self-created illusion where we limit our <BR>perceptions to what we are told is reality.<br />    Whereas in his earlier books Icke was only able to imagine a<BR>controlling interdimensional force manifesting itself in the physical, <BR>he now has assembled a staggering amount of documentation to prove his <BR>assertion. And the reader should beware, esp. if he/she is squeamish, <BR>because Icke makes a convincing case that the controllers are what <BR>he calls &quot;Nordics,&quot; but far more powerful, reptilian races. Icke calls <BR>these reptlians the &quot;Annunaki,&quot; a la Sitchin (The Twelfth Planet,&quot; etc.). <BR>While he agrees with Sitchin that the human race was probably created by <BR>these &quot;ET's&quot; (and others) mixing their geneswith those of some ape-like <BR>creature, Icke takes Sitchin on on precisely the point that our creators <BR>are reptilians.<br />    The author contends that the reptilian race(s) have controlled <BR>humanity from its inception, but more importantly, still do today.<BR>And this is where the story gets really &quot;harry,&quot; because Icke claims,<BR>and again he's got proof, whether you believe it or not, that many of<BR>the world leaders are reptilians, they shapeshift, and worst of all,<BR>they perform many Satanic rituals, most horrifically sacrificing <BR>children, whose blood is the purest available for their consumption! <BR>For those who want another reference on this topic that I find credible, <BR>read &quot;The Frankin Cover Up,&quot; by an ex-Nebraskan state senator.<br />    Icke doesn't mince words or attempt to mitigate his accusations,<BR>for sure. It seems that some of the controllers are trying to suppress<BR>his freedom of speech, and this is not surprising!<br />    As a peon who operates at a very low level of the pyramid, it's<BR>hard for me to know whether &quot;Children of the Matrix&quot; is accurate. But<BR>I do recommend the book highly, especially if you enjoy looking through<BR>an author's references. There are many fascinating sources, some <BR>ancient texts or books about ancient texts by brilliant authors, others<BR>brave souls in our time who have come forward to tell the world about<BR>some of what is really going on behind the scenes.<br />    One point I do not agree with Mr. Icke on is that everyone in the<BR>world lives under a monolthic dictatorship - this I know from first-hand<br />experience. On p. 405 he presents a very simplistic view that we in <BR>the US live under the same dictatorship as the Chinese. Yes, we are <BR>controlled, but no way is it the same for everyone, and it's a good <BR>practice to be grateful for the things we do have (even if it's just <BR>crumbs!).	2002-01-09
US	53062494	R186OEXQUNFVMC	083560781X	975357068	The Inner Life of Krishnamurti: Private Passion and Perennial Wisdom	Books	4	11	12	N	Y	First-rate synthesis of Theosophy and Krishnamurti	One of the main goals in the founding of the Theosophical Society<BR>was not only to revive lost ancient teachings, but moreover to point to<BR>a unity of the deeper, esoteric traditions of all religions. Theosophy<BR>posits that there is a perennial wisdom that spans all true spiritual<BR>teachings across time, and that there are certain Masters who help guide <BR>humanity in its evolution back to the One. A true Theosophist seeks to <BR>find common ground among seemingly disparate teachings. As the author <BR>proves both in what he writes as well as his point of view throughout <BR>this very fine book, finding the unity and explaining occult teachings <BR>in everyday language actually points to the Source of esoteric wisdom.<br />    Mr. Sanat attempts to show in &quot;The Inner Life of Krishnamurti&quot; that<BR>not only was K one of the perennial teachers himself, but that he was<BR>undeniably guided and aided, throughout his life, by the Masters of <BR>wisdom identified by the early Theosophists. I feel that Mr. Sanat <BR>proves this main point very well, no matter what the critics are<BR>saying. He cites quote after quote to back up his contention, statements <BR>that K himself said at different points in his life, incl. comments made <BR>long after he supposedly renounced his ties to the Masters, and the author <BR>also uses references from authors who wrote about K and yet wanted nothing <BR>to do with Theosophy. For example, on pp. 124-6 he cites P. Jayakar's book <BR>on K for a vivid account account of K's initiation by the Masters. <br />    In addition to proving that K did not deny the existence of the <BR>Masters in his life, Mr. Sanat also definitively answers the question why <BR>K would almost never talk about these matters in public. Perhaps the best<BR>passage is on p. 186: &quot;In other words, what he attacked was not the <BR>esoteric itself, but the way people took as lightweight and frivolous <BR>- as mere belief and opinion - what to him wereserious and sacred.&quot;<BR>As well clearly K, as H.P. Blavatsky before him, wanted to stress was <BR>that seeking knowledge and powers w/o transforming the mind and soul, was <BR>meaningless, an extension of the &quot;me.&quot;<br />    Mr. Sanat has a thorough understanding of K's teachings, and this<BR>book can be read just to enforce and expand one's own understanding<BR>of the perennial wisdom, regardless of one's feelings about Masters, the <BR>occult, etc. In my opinion the best chapter is Chapter Eight, &quot;Ecce <BR>Homo.&quot; Mr. Sanat discusses authority, relationships, the tricky concept <BR>&quot;the observer is the observed,&quot; and other subjects, clearly and <BR>from deep inspiration.<br />    Another dimension to the unity of concepts discussed here are<BR>illuminating discussions from a wealth of sources, like Nietzsche<BR>(\\"Superman\\"), Heidegger (authenticity), and many other books <BR>such as &quot;The Reimagination of the World.&quot; I have observed <BR>that many followers of K are apt to dismiss any analysis of K <BR>and unifying his teachings with others because to them &quot;K and <BR>only K is it.&quot; For those willing to synthesize across <BR>a range of other sources, a deeper understanding can be achieved, and I <BR>compliment the author highly for what he does in this area.<br />    This is not a perfect book- few are. My main disagreement is Sanat's<BR>contention that K was a successor to HPB - no way! Nevertheless the book<BR>is an inspiring read, of a writer who embodies the Theosophical ideals <BR>of searching for truth, and trying to unify rather than divide.	2001-11-21
US	53062494	R27JVAKZXXU9IU	1588511472	334680321	The Gospel of Love	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Very well-rearched account of an &quot;archetypal&quot; Messianic life	I have known the author of this book for about 20 years. He <BR>researches his topics on a level that would rival the labors of  <BR>many scholars in academia, though he is not in academia himself.<BR>This is his first published work, and I congratulate him on this<BR>achievement.<br />    It is not easy for me to review &quot;The Gospel of Love.&quot; I am<BR>not Christian, and I've read more alternate accounts of Jesus than<BR>the &quot;official&quot; New Testament versions. I can't quite get a clear <BR>picture of what Jesus's life would have been like, nor am I<BR>clear on his mission. I've read in my places that he was actually a <BR>Jewish prophet, and did not intend to start a new religion. It is<BR>also not clear to me if he really preached that love is THE answer.<BR>In my opinion THE answer is simply that there is no THE answer.<br />    The premise of &quot;The Gospel of Love&quot; is that few if any accounts of<BR>Jesus' life are considered historically accurate, and thus the author allows <BR>for a very different account of &quot;J's&quot; life than you will read elsewhere. The<BR>author chooses to present a composite of many teachings, not only of the New <BR>Testament Jesus (whom he calls Joshua), but also of many other spiritual <BR>doctrines, most prominently the Pythagorean teachings (vegetarianism, initiation <BR>through giving/suffering) and also the Eastern teachings, particularly the Vedas <BR>(karma, reincarnation, the Trinity as Creator-Preserver-Destroyer). <BR>One other point (I am in total agreement with the author on) is that<BR>the Jesus we usually encounter is in many senses simply a rehash of the<BR>stories and legends of *many* other &quot;Saviors.&quot; The main reference he uses<BR>is the book &quot;The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors,&quot; which shows exact <BR>parallels between the accounts of Jesus and Krishna, the Buddha, and others. <BR>These teachers were also born of virgin mothers, died on the cross, etc.<br />    The Joshua that Mr. Bright portrays knows from his earliest years that <BR>he is chosen for a spiritual mission if for no other reason than that he <BR>is obsessed with ending all suffering. While J undoubtedly is an advanced soul, <BR>he is presented not as an avatar who has all the answers, but rather<BR>as a soul who is obsessed with uncovering the truths of existence. For<BR>example, what is the conflict/battle that many feel between the<BR>fleshly and the spiritual aspects of human beings? Why is there so<BR>much suffering? And of course, what is THE answer?<br />    Before J leaves the Holy Land in search of answers, we see from the <BR>outset that he has total disdain for all laws, particularly religious laws. <BR>One passage in the book comes to mind, &quot;I tell you that the Laws of God are <BR>never found in dead scriptures. They exist only in the living...&quot;, i.e. all<BR>living beings. The author goes so far as to associate the High Priests <BR>of Judaism and their obsession with laws with Lucifer. Mr. Bright's<BR>careful study of Judaism, the Essenes, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the<br />Gnostics is seen in J's reaction to the (again) obsession of many of the <BR>ancient Jewish sects with what to us would be ridiculous rules of &quot;purity&quot; <BR>and conduct, yet still, particularly with the Gnostics, we see that one of <BR>the deepest spiritual truths is to get away from the crowds and go <BR>within, to find one's own truth, to advance to a level where one does<BR>not need such confining, &quot;dead&quot; laws.<BR>    <BR>    J's travels in his mysterious &quot;lost years&quot; take him to Egypt (twice), <BR>Greece, and the East, to Ladakh in the Himalayas, and then to Kashmir, <BR>which is depicted as the Garden of Eden in Genesis. While J is recognized <BR>as a great Master by all who come in contact with him, he also is a student<BR>who learns from a number of advanced teachers, who help in the &quot;final&quot; <BR>evolution of his soul before he returns to the Holy Land and begins his <BR>public mission. In his lessons, personal experiences, and initiations J<BR>resolves (almost) all of the profound questions listed above. The story<BR>of how he comes to understand how a human can be in the flesh and yet be <BR>spiritual will intrigue you (read the book!). <br />    Of course when J publicly starts his mission he proclaims &quot;The<BR>Gospel of Love.&quot; &quot;Nothing else really matters in the evolution of<BR>the soul&quot; (p. 445). Perhaps the strongest chapter is the one entitled<BR>&quot;The Gospel of Love.&quot; Yet personally I found &quot;love is the answer&quot; simplistic, <BR>and Mr. Bright himself contrasts the &quot;love&quot; of Jesus with many graphic and <BR>horrifying scenes of thousands of Jews being crucified by the Romans, both <BR>during J's mission and afterwards, culminating in the destruction of the <BR>Temple in Jerusalem. The author posits reasons for the suffering of the <BR>Jews throughout as well.<br />    I want to conclude this review by revealing that the J in the<BR>book is crucified, but he survives, and the author uses credible sources<BR>to allow for this possibility. Mr. Bright then presents an interesting<br />take on J's &quot;post-Savior&quot; life with Mary Magdalene, whom he marries <BR>before the crucifixion.	2001-11-10

I<BR>agree that Mr. Larson presents a very balanced, complete and usually <BR>interesting account of the Scopes Trial, including a fine background<BR>on the science vs. religion conflict that had been essentially<BR>artifically created by scientists in Darwin's time (p. 21). In fact<BR>many great scientists, from Newton on,  have believed that they were <BR>uncovering God's laws. Darwin himself was probably agnostic, but <BR>science after Darwin, surely due to Darwin, has become a license<BR>for atheism. Quoting an &quot;expert,&quot; Richard Dawkins, &quot;The universe we<BR>observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is at<BR>bottom no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but<BR>pointless indifference.&quot; In my opinion this scientism, this <BR>&quot;rationalism,&quot; is a travesty for which there is no &quot;scientific proof.&quot;<br />    In the introduction and first chapter of the book we read about <BR>the evidence that was accepted, more or less, by scientists at the<BR>time of the trial for the purported ape-to-man evolution. The author<BR>devotes some pages to the Piltdown man and Dart's Taungs man-ape. <BR>What the author does not even bother to mention is that the Piltdown <BR>man was proven to be a fraud, but it took until 1953, 40 years <BR>after its discovery, for the truth to come out. You know why? The <BR>pattern of so-called &quot;self-correcting&quot; science has repeated itself <BR>continuously in the ape-to-human debate, which is that evolutionists <BR>keep making public discoveries about &quot;missing links,&quot; to convince us <BR>that they know that man evolved from apes through meaningless &quot;natural <BR>selection,&quot; but discoveries are made all the time that contradict and <BR>refute the prior &quot;proof.&quot; There is a mass of confusion on this issue <BR>that has been well-documented in many books. The contention that <BR>whatever their disagreements, at times almost violent disagreements, <BR>scientists know that humans evolved from apes by accident, is an <BR>empty contention as far I'm concerned. They do it, first of all, out<BR>of hubris, and secondly to counteract Fundamentalism. Those of us <BR>who just want the facts are caught in the middle.<br />    (By the way, Dart'sdiscovery is also no longer in vogue, as far <BR>as I know, and anyway it was rejected by many evolutionists for about<BR>20 years in his time.)<br />    It seems that in our time so-called &quot;rational&quot; people must believe<BR>that evolution is a &quot;fact&quot; that totally explains the way life has come <BR>about on the earth. I've got plenty of references, by scientists and <BR>n0n-scientists, that prove that this simply is not the case. Please<BR>email me if you are interested in references that debate the &quot;fact&quot; <BR>of Darwinian evolution. In my opinion, 2 quotes from W. J. Bryan on<BR>p. 42 are still true: a) &quot;Darwinism is not science...it is guesses<BR>strung together&quot; (I deleted &quot;at all,&quot; because microevolution is<BR>proven); b) &quot;Man is infinitely more than science...&quot;	2001-09-11

Some events happened to me in 1977 that made me feel very confident that many really big changes were going to happen, and I was certain that the changes would start happening in about 1995, oddly enough about the time of this book's publication. The things that happened to me were not in any way the same as what happened to Vance Davis and the &quot;Gulf Breeze 6,&quot; yet reading parts of this book, especially the predictions of apocalypse, reminded me of visions I had as well as intuitions i.e, &quot;things are so messed up in this world, it just can't go on the way it is!&quot;<br />  Only it's 2001 as I write this review, and from my point of view none of the big changes happened, and thus while I liked &quot;Unbroken Promises,&quot; I was soured by the parts that predict apocalypse and have, at least to this date, been proven wrong over and over. Personally I also don't react very favorably when dire predictions are made and then  the &quot;prophet&quot; claims that they didn't come to pass because people &quot;woke up,&quot; or whatever excuse can be thought of.<br />  &quot;Unbroken Promises&quot; is first of all Mr. Davis's autobiography. He is a psychic trained in Silva Mind Control who eventually goes to work for the NSA. Davis, who is also keenly interested in consciousness expansion, learns how to go into deep meditative states, to the point of meeting spirit guides, such as Kia, who claims to be from a planet forty-five light years away. Yet Mr. Davis also is a religious, or better-stated, spiritual man, and he repeatedly asks Jesus for help in all his endeavors. To some having contact with aliens while believing in Christ might seem strange!<br />  The real story of &quot;Unbroken Promises&quot; occurs during the summer of 1990, when Davis and 5 other mililtary personnel begin to dabble in the  paranormal while stationed in Germany, eventually to the point of  communicating with spirits through an Ouija board. They have 7 sessions  with these spirits. At first there isn't a totally religious overtone,  but quickly more spirits come through, and almost all of these spirits  use the names of apostles of Jesus. The messages they give are a mixture of good ol' Biblical global apocalypse, a la the Book of Revelations, along with specific directions to the 6 humans to leave their posts and return to America, to help with the &quot;big changes&quot; that are imminent. They are told not only the approximate date to go AWOL, but also, repeatedly, that they will be protected from danger.<br />  So the 6 do go AWOL, ending up in Gulf Breeze, FL. Unfortunately  they are caught, and initially are treated like hardened criminals who  have engaged in espionage. After about 3 weeks of imprisonment, during  which the story becomes a public scandal, they are not only released, but  almost unbelievably are given a choice - they can actually remain in the military or receive honorable discharges (they of course choose the latter)! In short, all the predictions that the spirit guides make concerning their welfare come true (assuming none are omitted, and I question that). We are told implicitly and explicitly that in fact the 6 do have &quot;friends in high places,&quot; and one of the important points made in the book is that the US govt. is divided into &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; factions.<br />  What is a bit &quot;unkosher&quot; about the book is the claim by the authors (mostly via the channeling from the Ouija board) that Mr. Davis and<br />company are going to play a very important in the &quot;awakening&quot; of humanity during the aforementioned apocalyse, the apocalyse that in my view still shows little indication of happening. And indeed almost all of the really dire events listed towards the end of the book, such as riots in many major cities, the widespread institution of martial law, and particularly the coming of the Peacemaker/anti-Christ, have simply not come to pass, which is why I question whether Mr. Davis supplies a complete list of predictions concerning his group going AWOL.<br />  Still, &quot;Unbroken Promises&quot; is surely an intriguing book to read and ponder, and I have no doubt about Mr. Davis's sincerity. I also enjoyed the inclusion of the accounts of 3 females who were involved in the arrest of the Gulf Breeze 6 (one who had gone AWOL, plus 2 friends, one of whom Mr. Davis had seen in a dream 10 years before and became his  wife!). The final part of the book are the documents that back up what  was written about the imprisonment and release of the 6.avis supplies a complete list of predictions concerning his group going AWOL.<br />  Still, &quot;Unbroken Promises&quot; is surely an intriguing book to read and ponder, and I have no doubt about Mr. Davis's sincerity.

Perhaps the necessary detachment in this case comes from the fact that Brahms died just over a hundred years ago, for his was not a perfect character!<br />  I have always liked Brahms' compositions quite a bit, especially  his chamber music, which is among the best. Yet I have never bothered to read a biography of the composer. I only read this one because  a relative of mine is handling the estate of one of the author's  wives (not Irene, the collaborator), and while visiting this relative I was offered the book. Fortunately, from the outset I thoroughly enjoyed reading Prof. Geiringer's biography.<br />  Geiringer acknowledges that there have been many other fine  biographies of Brahms, and he decided to write one only because he  was given access to about a thousand letters of correspondence Brahms  received from well-know artists like the Schumann's, the violinist  Joachim, and many others.  Geiringer combines a vast knowledge of Brahms' life and music with these letters to produce a highly readable and entertaining work, w/o a hint of sensationalism.<br />  In order to leave enough room for a discussion of Brahms' extensive output, the author limits his discussion of the composer's life to  about 200 pages, yet it is quite thorough. Brahms' early life of extreme poverty is discussed w/o trying to evoke sympathy, followed by the burgeoniong composer's failure to get a post in his native Hamburg, a lifelong hurt for Brahms, but which very fortuitously causes him to move eventually to Vienna, where his music flowers in a very supportive environment. The young composer's career is given a huge push by a letter Robert Schumann writes in a widely read journal, and Brahms fulfills those expectations, though he surely destroys many compositions we would love to hear, because of his high standards. Also, Brahms, unlike other composers, receives the accolades he deserves while still alive and composing.<br />  The view we get of Brahms is balanced - we see his good humor and we also read the famous quote of the composer, who, upon leaving a party, wonders if there is anyone there he has not insulted! Also, while Brahms reaches tremendous heights in his art, he never marries in order to achieve it, and we read about the women (mostly singers of his choral music) he loves but cannot attach himself to. No, Brahms is far from perfect, yet the composer is unfailingly helpful and generous to his family, friends, and also to other composers - Dvorak usually comes to mind in this respect.<br />  Following the biographical discussion of Brahms' life, the author as musicologist again provides a thorough but not excessive discussion of the different kinds of works the composer put out, from the chamber music to the many varieties of choral works.<br />  Towards the end of the book Geiringer writes an excellent chapter called &quot;The Man And The Artist,&quot; a thorough summary that, as expected,  is succinct yet not sensational in any way.d journal, and Brahms fulfills those expectations, though he surely destroys many compositions we would love to hear, because of his high standards.

I used to think at some point some areas of common agreement and disagreement could be brought about by an &quot;objective&quot; discussion of the &quot;facts,&quot; but after reading many books and reviews I have just about concluded that this is unachievable because the sides are too deeply entrenched. I have concluded that it is simply impossible to look at evolution totally objectively and I must come down on the side of the those who oppose evolution, precisely because I feel that Darwinists are &quot;all or nothing.&quot; They tend to take the stand that evolution proves everything, from the purported evollution of a single-celled bacteria (which itself was a freak accident) into the almost infinite complexity we see today, on also an infinitude of levels. Yes, to them it's all a big accident that can be explained by natural processes...<br /> One final note, is that it is very, very tricky to unravel what is the truth between those who would argue that scientists can look at data objectively and those who say that scientists must have a theory to interpret and organize their data. I feel that this issue is at the heart of the ape-to-human debate.<br /> Two books with identical names, &quot;Bones of Contention,&quot; are excellent examples in comparison if one wants to try to sort out the above. The other &quot;Bones of Contention&quot; is Roger Lewin's defense of evolution proving the apes-to-human transition, written about 5 years before Mr. Lubenow's book. Yet at the outset of his book even Mr. Lewin, who is an ardent Darwinist, makes the point many times that scientists are biased not only by theories but by their own biases: &quot;...preconceived ideas shape the progress of all sciences, but nowhere else to the degree that occurs in the search for human origins&quot; (p. 20). I really appreciate Mr. Lewin's honesty in stating in his book how many times the theories of human origins have changed and in my opinion he shows that evolution is assumed as a fact first, and then the fossils are found that &quot;prove&quot; it. Mr. Lewin may not agree with the my opinion, of course. In any event, even this Darwinian defense of human evolution shows that scientists are not as objective as they claim. Mr. Lubenow at least makes no &quot;bones&quot; about his agenda, and his mixing of Christian fundamentalist agenda with what I consider to be solid evidence against human evolution gives me mixed feelings, but despite his biases, I feel that Mr. Lubenow makes an excellent case that the evidence for human evolution is simply untrue. In any event, it is nowhere near as convincing as &quot;objective&quot; scientists claim it to be. <br />    I wanted to make my review more of an overview, a philosophical discussion of the issues, because at the &quot;top&quot; level I feel that  a lot of these science-religion debates are not so much about science or religion, but about who knows THE truth, who is right. I feel that in our times science makes far too many claims, far too many extrapolations, that they can prove this or that about what happened millions and billions of years ago, with a kind of all-knowingness that reminds me of the religious superstitions that were very  (fortunately) superseded by what science can really prove. And despite his agenda, Mr. Lubenow repeatedly makes precisely this distinction, and professes what I feel is sincere admiration for the many truly proven discoveries of science.<br />    Other reviewers have discussed the details that this &quot;Bones of Contention&quot; thrashes out, so you can read those reviews. As the &quot;yes's&quot; recommend, I also recommend reading this book if you haven't  made up your mind on this issue. For an excellent example of the  problems with human evolution and the assumptions of evolutionists, I  highly recommend doing what Mr. Lubenow reommends in the final footnote  of his book (#42, p. 286). Read Mr. Lewin's two chapters on the KBS Tuff  affair, a ten-year, highly contentious controversy that was crucial to  the evolutionists' &quot;proof&quot; for human evolution, and compare that with  Mr. Lubenow's very thorough presentation (appendix) of the same. I feel  that an open-minded person, if such is possible in this debate, will see  many problems with fossil dating as well as the evolutionist case  for human origins.	2001-06-11
US	53062494	R1JCWMCQY6VWKB	1893956032	504479648	A Language Older Than Words	Books	2	53	81	N	N	Insighful analyses marred by negative overkill	A friend of mine once created a kind of collage that said, &quot;As I am transformed, the world is tranformed.&quot; I admire the ideal expressed in my friend's collage, but I have always believed that while it is important to transform ourselves, the problems in the world and with our species require far deeper resolutions than individual work, such as meditating, projecting love, peace, etc.<br />    Thus I do agree in spirit with a lot of what Mr. Jensen says in his 370+page book. I think that the problems in the world can only worsen if things go on as they are, but that is just my opinion. On the other hand, so far the world has gone on, despite one prediction after another, ad infinitum, by ecologically-minded people, religious extremists, etc. Thus I can only conclude that the earth and humanity are far more resilient than the predictors of doom are willing to admit. <br />    Mr Jensen is not just an environmental extremist, he takes extreme positions on just about every facet of what he discusses. In fact the word extreme is really tame for many of the stands taken in this book. The correct term is more like in-your-face, and that might be a tame word also.<br />     The author does have a very good handle on the causes of many  of the problems in the world and with the human species. To name  but a few of his points, he cites the lack of love, fear, coercion,  oppression/torture of women, minorities, native peoples world-wide,  and animals, and the overvaluing of money along with the  obsession/overemphasis of producing (unnecessary) material goods. He discusses these points insightfully and thoroughly, and he very deftly analyses the deleterious effects of Newtonian-Cartesian reductionism on the social sciences. Also, people do live in denial  about what is going on. Few question much of anything. &quot;Ignorance  is bliss&quot; is very relevant to our times.<br />    Yet to me the book fails badly. On the one hand, on p. 142 Jensen correctly states that&quot;life is untidy&quot; and talks about embracing life's contradictions. But his real agenda is to trash everyone and everything that doesn't agree with his worse-than-extreme positions, so later (p. 198) we get a simplistic quote from Victor  Frankl that either we are decent or indecent people. I will give one  of countless examples I could of Mr. Jensen's extremisms based on this  black or white illogic. To the author, if you are a decent, hardworking  &quot;wage slave,&quot; trying to raise a family, you support capitalism, you  are trashing the planet and oppressing the have-nots, and thus you  are &quot;bad.&quot; His extremism reaches absurd heights, such that on p. 371,  as he is wrapping up the book, we read, &quot;We are, of course, already  dead. There is no hope.&quot; This is nonsense.<br />    I do not have enough space to discuss Mr. Jensen's personal pain. It is tragic, there is no doubt about that. Yet Mr. Jensen seems to feel that his pain is not only unique (it isn't), but also gives him the right not only to judge humanity as a failure, and furthermore to paint himself as some sort of Messiah carrying that burden. It  doesn't work. And while I do not totally buy into the New Age dictum  that we always create our own reality, in Mr. Jensen's case I have no doubt that it applies far more than he would believe.<br />    I also do not want to discuss the title of the book, because to me it is maybe a tertiary theme to what the book really delves into. I will say that I do not doubt at all that interspecies communication exists, &quot;without words,&quot; and that sensitive people can pick up things from the earth and non-humans.<br />    One question that is asked repeatedly I do want to answer. On p. 237 we read, &quot;Where do we look for ultimate responsibility...?&quot; I recommend the book, &quot;And The Truth Shall Set You Free,&quot; by David Icke. You will get answers, though they may not be *the* answers.<br />    &quot;A Language Older Than Words&quot; comes highly recommended by the author of &quot;Diet For A Small Planet&quot; and other respected authors of alternative books. Personally I would recommend this often overstated  diatribe only to deeply wounded souls looking for large-scale scapegoats. As for caring and aware people who are trying to live decent lives,  please consider my review and the other reviews and decide for yourselves.	2001-05-20
US	53062494	RPYVSFEU8G28Z	0898854482	911559287	The new biology: Law, ethics, and biotechnology	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Merger of biology/physics; great alternative to Darwinism	I get very tired of reading claims by biologists that everything in life's evolution can be explained by the meaningless, accidental  process of the catch-all phrase that Darwin coined, called &quot;natural  selection.&quot; Natural selection is actually a holdover from the  Newtonian view of the world, where life and its processes are seen  as nothing more than mechanical automations. As the authors of  &quot;The New Biology&quot; demonstrate quite well, biology needs to get  beyond this mechnical view of life and catch up with physics, which  has shown that life is not a &quot;matter machine,&quot; but rather is also  part of Mind, consciousness. Matter and mind are &quot;the two  ultimate realities,&quot; and matter cannot be understood only in terms  of its physical and chemical properties.<br />    The Mind in organisms is their ability to rebuild their own  parts, their transformations, not only, for example, the dramatic change from a butterfly to a caterpillar, or the ability of <br />starfish to regenerate any body part, but also the transformation of the food an organism takes in, where the food is converted by the organism into itself. An organism shows profound unities on many levels that clearly is more than the sum of its organs and internal processes.<br />    The authors also take on many Darwinian &quot;facts&quot; and show that they are utterly false. In Chapter 4, called &quot;Cooperation,&quot; they present a wealth of evidence pointing to the real truth in nature, <br />which is that while younger species do often engage in a &quot;survival  of the fittest&quot; competition, more mature species cooperate, divide  their territories, or simply carve out their own niches. A quote  on p. 101 is very telling: &quot;Nature is arranged so that competitive  struggles are avoided...peaceful coexistence, not struggle, is  the rule.&quot;<br />    Darwin's maxim that if overpopulated species are not controlled  by predators or famine has also been proven false. Populations are <br />controlled by internal causes, there are a large portion of non-breeding adults, and in lean years many species do not breed at all. An  example is given of a mackerel which lays millions of eggs, yet only a very small percentage survives. Most of the eggs are actually a &quot;gift&quot; of food to other animals!<br />    My favorite chapter is &quot;Origins,&quot; which takes on many other  Darwinian precepts and shows again that they are simply untrue. I  will only give two examples of the thorough debunking of the &quot;fact&quot; of  Darwinian evolution. First, all higher level forms of life, phyla, appeared during the Cambrian Age, about 500 million years ago (assuming the veracity of dating techniques). No new phyla have appeared since.  The &quot;pattern of shift from few species in many groups to many species  in fewer groups flatly contradicts Darwinian gradualism.&quot; Second, there  is practically no evidence of one type of animal changing into  another, which is far more telling that relatively trivial mutations  of one species into another, for a plant is still a plant, a dog is  still a dog, etc. I realize that in controveries involving the fossil  record it will be &quot;your references against mine.&quot;  In any case, the  authors present a lot of documentation to back up their points. A corollary point to my second above is that the fossil record shows not species mutations but rather unmistakeable statis.<br />    There are also interesting chapters about purpose and the natural hierarchy in species, internally, morphologically, and in activities. This natural hierarchy seems so obvious that I re-state what the authors have written so well only because  according to the modern Darwinists there is no hierarchy, for they have &quot;proven&quot; that any species can change into another by natural selection.<br />    Finally, the authors propose an alternative to natural selection as the cause of species change, systematicdifferentiation by  regulatory genes, the Mind of the organism in this sense. The authors  posit that systematic differentiation is not accidental, but rather  a self-directing mechanism arising from potentials within the  organism.<br />    I highly recommend &quot;The New Biology&quot; for its well-documented discussion, for merging of Mind and matter in biology, echoing  modern physics, and for depicting a purpose in life, w/o religious  overtones, in contradistinction to Darwinian meaninglessness.	2001-04-25

She is in my metaphysical/paranormal discussion group in southern Oregon. I've known her for 3 years, and I have been impressed by her intellligence and kindness - she has achieved a balance between left brain and right brain abilities, and her book on labyrinths gives teachers and parents, for whom the book is written, excellent yet simple ways to develop both skills in  children using the techniques she has developed and tested.<br />    Joseph Campbell, the great mythologist, became famous posthumously for his saying, &quot;follow your bliss.&quot; Lani's passion is labyrinths, for  sure. As she states in the introduction, she &quot;has focused her entire career trying to answer questions about how children learn, what motivates children to learn...and what makes an activity fun and successful.&quot; I can remember a number of times in our discussion group Lani discussing with infectious enthusiasm, her love of labyrinths and how she has used them in teaching children, especially  children with handicaps, which she has been involved with for many years.  Yet labyrinths are also very useful for children who are not handicapped. Lani also makes the important distinction between mazes, which are  often a bit too challenging to figure out, vs. labyrinths, which are always well-defined, and whose destination is always easy to attain.<br />    Lani and her husband toured the US in the summer of 2000 and if  she knew there was a labyrinth in the area she was visiting, they  stopped there!<br />    The author, in a very easy to understand, thorough, and  straightforward manner, shows the reader the various kinds of  labyrinths as well as the skills used and developed in learning  how to create them. She starts with very simple, basic patterns, and  shows how to create 3-path, 7-path, 11-path, and 15-path labyrinths, as  well as how to create double labyrinths. She then gives lists of many  different kinds of materials that can be used to create these figures.  She discusses how to &quot;walk&quot; a drawn labyrinth. Books and web sites are  also provided at the end of the book.<br />    Finally, there is an appendix that shows the basic patterns for labyriths, and then (of course) a second appendix with some beautiful labyrinths the author and her students have created from various materials, as well as interesting and fun drawings of  labyrinths by Lani's students and not unexpectantly, her grandchildren!<br />    If you have young children, I highly recommend Lani's book, her passion, to you!	2001-04-23

Yet as Prof. Jones shows in a  very readable fashion, we must not only not confuse these metaphors  with reality itself, we need to understand that the metaphors are in  many ways hindering us from perceiving the deeper unities in all things, as certain ancient races understood and Native American cultures  still preach today. These are unities not only among humans and with  the cosmos, but also the ties among overly specialized academic  displines, such as the hard sciences, psychology, and religion.<br />    For those who have read other anti-scientism tracts the above surely sounds familiar, but &quot;Physics As Metaphor&quot; demonstrates in precise, readable, logical terms why the four cardinal metaphors of physics,  number, space, time, and measure, are only human, self-referential  devices. Rather than trying to show the convergence of sub-atomic  physics and mysticism, Prof. Jones takes a different tact and very  insightfully also demonstrates that metaphors like space and measure  actually cause us to separate ourselves from the deeper unity of the  One. And no matter what science says about the meaningless of  &quot;its&quot; universe, people are perenially searching for (deeper) meaning.<br />    &quot;Physics As Metaphor&quot; borrows skillfully from the writings of other scientists and philosophers of science, like Barfield, Polyani, Poincare, Kuhn, and many others, and at the end of the book there is a comprehensive guide to the sources the author used to formulate the  ideas in the book. Perhaps the most meaningful chapter in Jones's book  is his discussion of our search for &quot;absolute truth&quot; in science as a  form of escapism from facing our own mortality. Ernest Becker's book,  &quot;The Denial of Death,&quot; which I was &quot;coincidentally&quot; reading at the same  time (and recently reviewed), is discussed in the context of how the  four cardinal metaphors of physics are symbolic of the illusory  struggle for eternal life and lasting significance.<br />     The final chapters are the author's recommendations for teaching physics (science) as metaphor. Exercises are given which attempt to expand the awareness of the student, to see things from different apoints of view, to provide new metaphors.	2001-03-12
US	53062494	R2Z6NR1K5UK8IB	0684832402	141648772	The Denial of Death	Books	5	336	351	N	N	Masterpiece of synthesis and insight	There are some books that are brilliant because they delve deeply into one subject. There are other books that are brilliant because they synthesize a panorama of other great books. Finally, there are perhaps the rarest of works that in one book combine the insights of many other brilliant tomes and make the synthesis seem like one subject. &quot;The Denial of Death&quot; belongs to this rarest of  books. The excellence of the insights on so many pages is breathtaking,  and it's only fitting that Becker, certainly a great writer  previously, made his last book, published shortly and ironically  before his death, his best.<br />    Becker states at the outset the problem in our day is not that there isn't enough knowledge, the problem is that there isn't  enough integration of this knowledge into a kind of wisdom that would properly summarize the accumulated knowledge. At the outset he acknowledges the difficulty in claiming that there is one direct insight into what causes (almost) all of the neuroses of life, which is the inability of people to see and overcome what I feel is the ultimate paradox of life, that we live and die at the same time. Yet in one book Becker succeeds so well it is astounding!<br />    To summarize a summarizing book is difficult indeed! Basically what Becker claims is that man has twin but conflicting ontological  needs/motives - to individuate and yet at the same time to feel a part  of something greater. Man is a paradox in many other ways. Unlike other  animals inside he (I will omit she to keep it simple) is largely symbolic - in his mind he can imagine the farthest mysteries of the universe, he  can philosophize about the deepest meanings of life and its purpose. Yet like other animals man is anal (discussed extensively!) and possesses a body that is only too mortal.  <br />    Countless times Becker makes the point that the way most people live with these paradoxes is a &quot;lie in the face of reality.&quot; That is,  starting from childhood most people use all kinds of repressions to  pretend that they aren't going to die. Much of society is based on symbolic  systems for people to feel heroic, because when we achieve heroism we feel  that we have transcended our mortality. Much of this heroism is in fact false, even disempowering, because for example most pointedly with  entertainers and athletes we often in fact project our need for heroism  onto them. In psychology this is called transference, which manifests  itself in group psychology and other ways that Becker thoroughly covers.         <br />    Modern man has lost its way because science has removed the need for God, something transcendent beyond the physical life.  Transcending Freud, citing Otto Rank most by far, as well many other  fine psychologists, and even including Kirkegaard who predated  them, Becker claims that it has been &quot;scientifically&quot; proven that  the only way for man to deal with his fate, to achieve his innate  heroic need, is to give his life up to something greater than the  physical, call it God or whatever you wish. Thus he merges psychology  with religion, in my opinion, quite correctly.<br />    In bare form these are some of the main themes of &quot;The Denial of  Death.&quot; The book is a must read if a person has the courage to tackle  this most &quot;urgent&quot; issue. I don't think you'll find a better analysis  than Becker's. It could dramatically change the way you look at the  world and the people who live in it.  <br />    In the end I did feel that Becker got somewhat carried away with his insight that the denial of death is the key to understanding  people's deepest neuroses - he took it to what I felt was the extreme  that it is simply impossible to transcend the denial of death. People  who have had near death experiences in many cases seem to have overcome  the fear of death, people who have mastered Eastern disciplines like  meditation have done the same, and finally self-actualized people who  simply live knowing that they are souls having a physical experience  can also overcome the angst of physical mortality.	2001-03-01
US	53062494	R1A027UELK4JZC	0231113129	479260494	An All-Consuming Century	Books	4	29	29	N	N	Excellent history of consumerism; some disagreements	It is not easy for me to review this book about consumerism. The subject is far more complex than its critics admit. Mr. Cross's book underscores this point very well, though in the end I feel that he overstates this (see last paragraph).<br />    I am an unabashed critic of consumerism, its banality, its lowest  common denominator mentality, and yet as an American with sufficient funds I can certainly buy anything I want to, what little that is these days. I do feel grateful that I live in a society where there is such an  abundance it is beyond belief. I sometimes wonder what the availability  of the things I do want would be if the capitalist machine, which has created and sustained this overabundance of &quot;things&quot; and services, did not function so efficiently.<br />    Far more importantly, I have seen and read about societies in which people do not even have enough to eat, where their basic psychological needs are not met. Such peoples are not in a position to philosophize about which is the best economic system, or what is the meaning and value of life. I have always felt some guilt about this in addition to gratitude.<br />    Mr. Cross has written a book that very well documents the spectacular  rise of consumerism in American in the 20th century. &quot;The All-Consuming Century&quot; is very scholarly yet is also quite accessible. The author  brings out a number of penetrating points that I feel are worthy of  consideration and discussion by anyone who is interested and concerned  about consumerism. For example, he claims that consumerism has been a  powerful force for democratization, &quot;creating social solidarities,&quot;  allowing for participation by widely different groups of people, thus facilitating in a way different kinds of unities.<br />    The author shows many contradictions with consumerism, which is why the topic is so complex. To give several examples, consumer goods have  excused people from the pain and &quot;humiliation&quot; of exposing who they really are publicly because they can simply buy their way into communities of  like-minded consumers. Yet at the same time they perhaps avoid  realizing *who* they really are! Consumerism has at once provided the  opportunity for people to express their individuality and gain privacy in homes with their own possessions, yet at the same time media (TV and  movies) have actually atomized people. Automobiles certainly have  provided tremendous freedom, yet the experience itself is essentially  limited and homogenized. Perhaps the standardization of experience was  true when cars were first mass produced, and not so much today.<br />    While I did enjoy the thorough history of 20th century consumerism I did find the details to be very excessive: the chapter &quot;Promises of More&quot; was particularly uninteresting for me because it seemed to be nothing more than the details of consumerism with little analysis. I did find it surprising that even during the depression consumerism did not diminish nearly as much as I would have expected, which certainly brings home the point that people want things, rewards for their hard work, and they do identify with their possessions.<br />    My favorite two chapters of the book were the final two. The first covers the period when capitalism really moved into high gear from  1980-2000, where the author makes the very cogent point that the Reagan Right criticized the lack of values and morality in society, while at the same time opened up markets to the maximum, practically w/o restraint, and saw no conflict! The final chapter is a very good summary of the book with some advice on how we can perhaps moderate consumerism. which the author feels is unsustainable in the long term. The author states that it is not an easy matter to constrain consumerism because it operates so efficiently, because people want goods, and because there is no mass phenomena that can successfully challenge this &quot;machine.&quot; He does call for a balance, but I felt that it was a shame that he waited until the second-to-last page to state this magic word, balance! For in my view there is no solution to gross consumerism  except for 1) an economic collapse, or 2) finding a balance between consuming and enjoying non-material things.<br />    Who is define the balance between consuming and not consuming is  clearly a personal matter, and that is why I feel that each of us has  to decide for ourselves, rather than assuming that some societal  program will come about to provide the answers. Most institutions are  in complete disrepute these days, and perhaps rightfully so. Also,  unfortunately the author barely mentions that Americans especially  are almost totally co-opted by the hegemony of corporations's endless  greed for profits, which has created a system where few get more than  a week or two of vacation, and thus have little time to express <br />themselves any other way than through what they consume. I felt that his  comments about the failure of the &quot;jeremiad&quot; against consumerism by  such authors as Vance Packard (whose &quot;old&quot; books are not dated) were  incorrect. These authors accurately pointed out the simple truth that long ago powerful interests created a &quot;totalitarianism&quot; of materialism,  and their books still ring largely true in my opinion.	2001-02-14

Books	4	12	13	N	Y	A definitive exposure of incomplete scientific &quot;knowing&quot;	I am woefully unqualified to review this book, but I feel that I did get enough out of it to discuss it somewhat intelligently. I have taken the time over the last few years to read science books that challenge the various high priesthoods of science, from the men who say they know that Darwinian evolution explains the development all life, to the men who claim they can tell us within less than a second when and how the universe came about. These hallowed guardians of the gates of truth tell us w/o the slightest doubt that in addition to what they know about what happened in the past, that therefore they can assure us that it was all a big accident and has no meaning for us individually or collectively.<br />  But maybe they (and their scientism) don't know as much as they claim, as Mr. Mitchell's interesting and *very* challenging book documents in astonishing detail!<br />  When you study the Big Bang theory (BBT), you see that what cosmologists have done is use theories, yes only theories, of particle physics to prove the BBT, which is saying that what goes on at the sub-atomic level also explains &quot;the whole shebang.&quot; If the theories don't match the data, the cosmologists invent some new theory, like inflation, which then somehow exactly fits the data that caused the inconsistency, and thus &quot;proves&quot; once again that the theory is correct. This cycle has repeated itself many times with the BBT.<br />  Because of the connection between BBT and particle physics, Mr. Mitchell includes a rather amazing discussion of this topic as one of the first chapters, along with relativity and quantum physics. I had no idea that there were so many types and varieties of particles determined by physicists!<br />  Next, he presents a very good discussion of the history of the BBT, and immediately starts his relentless critique of many, many serious problems with BBT. For example, the whole idea that there was a singularity that exploded into the universe itself violates many laws of physics. Then he discusses the smoothness issue, which is that the universe is full of irregularities that violate the BBT.<br />  In the next chapter Mitchell tells us that there is not one version of BBT, but there are actually three: the flat, open, and closed BBT universes. Throughout the remainder of the book the author shows the problems and contradictions with each version of BBT, in a discussion that often left me confused, but at least I understood his logic! Not surprising, after all, we are dealing with the whole universe!<br />  I will mention only four more of a plethora of issues that are discussed in the remainder of the book.<br />  1) BB cosmologists have determined that 90-99% of the physical universe must be dark matter for the BBT to be correct, but, believe it or not, they have not as far as I know definitely identified any! On a similar note, I might also mention that I am still seeing articles in &quot;Science News&quot; where cosmologists are saying that they think they've found an &quot;event horizon,&quot; which would prove the existence of black holes. And I thought they had found proof of black holes many years ago!<br />  2) Microwave background radiation (MBR) is usually brought out as the most definitive &quot;proof&quot; of BBT. Mr. Mitchell thoroughly shows the contradictions with MBR and all three BBT universes, and also notes that MBR might be consistent with other cosmological theories.<br />  3) Matter vs. anti-matter - The BBT does not explain why there is so much more matter than anti-matter, when according to current theories of physics they should be equal.<br />  4) &quot;The Great Wall&quot; of supercluster galaxies, which could be up to 100 billion years old, thoroughly discredits all of the dates given by BBT theorists, that the universe is 8 to 15 billion years old.<br />  Mr. Mitchell includes a very humorous chapter on the priests of cosmology, where the messiah is Einstein, the head priest is Stephen Hawking, and he provides lists of university &quot;churches&quot; where the interlocking careers of BBT &quot;bishops&quot; assure that all is well and the BBT is the correct &quot;Genesis&quot; of creation. Any scientist who dares to challenge BBT dogma will be excommunicated.<br />  Finally, because an alternative cosmology is needed to replace the one he discredits, Mr. Mitchell presents what he calls the &quot;near&quot; Steady State Theory, or NSST, which is a resurrection of the discredited SST along with additions to make it more suitable to what has been observed so far.<br />  I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in BBT, even if he/she can only understand this book cursorily, like me!the head priest is Stephen Hawking, and he provides lists of university &quot;churches&quot; where the interlocking careers of BBT &quot;bishops&quot; assure that all is well and the BBT is the correct &quot;Genesis&quot; of creation.

The corporate co-opting of everything, combined with the nihilistic dictum of postmodernism, that there is no truth, that everything is relative, is diminishing our culture down to the point that we live in a &quot;McWorld,&quot; where materialism and money are the only things of value, where there is a rush of busy-ness, but it is often very empty. True education and true culture are almost non-existent, especially in main stream mass communication. Universities are no longer institutions of education, but rather in a sense like shopping malls where professors treat students as customers instead of challenging them.       Yet Prof. Berman claims that we should not be surprised by this decline. Comparing our time to the fall of the Roman Empire and its aftermath, Prof Berman demonstrates that history simply plays  itself out in cycles of rise, decline, and disintegration. During and  after the decline culture is preserved, generally by monks, who either  realize or do not realize that they are preserving something of value for posterity. <br />    As I expected, the author's sources are excellent, and I particularly<br />enjoyed his discussions of 2 science fiction books, whose authors are indeed sometimes very prescient about future trends. Bradbury's  &quot;Farenheight 451&quot; depicts a society where reading books is banned, as  opposed to the current situation, where reading isn't &quot;cool&quot; and is  shunned, which is it's own kind of totalitarianism. Even better for me is the discussion of the sci-fi classic, &quot;A Canticle For Leibowitz,&quot; which I had not liked when I read it, because it perfectly suits the author's illustration of the way civilizations cycle up and down, often  inexplicably, and it is usually monks who preserve the culture of a  fallen society, sometimes both the valuable and the ridiculous,  because the monk preservers don't know the difference!<br />    Thus Prof. Berman calls on his readers to be like monks, to preserve what is worth preserving in our culture, as it self destructs and perhaps even disintegrates. He calls on us as individuals to act alone or in small groups (he disdains large movements, &quot;isms&quot;) and preserve our culture, our history, literature, art, etc. We can't do this with thought of reward, but given the value of what monks have done at crucial points in time we could make a big difference  in the future when our civilization perhaps rises again. He also gives examples of inspiring individuals who are making a difference in perhaps &quot;small&quot; but effective ways to preserve culture and fight for what they believ in.<br />    Again, the analysis is thorough and excellent, but I must take  exception to some of the author's criticisms, especially as they relate to his solution. First of all, many people still read books and take part in the arts. Second, I am somewhat of a New Age thinker  myself, though I do share some of his criticisms of New Age-isms. Yet  where  I feel that Prof. Berman makes a glaring error is in his  inability to understand the value of certain aspects of New Age  thinking. As I was reading the book I kept thinking of Socrates's (?)  aphorism, &quot;Know Thyself.&quot; Prof. Berman barely mentions this inner  discipline, and he seems to feel that about the only way to know  onself is to read books. I disagree. I feel that the intellect is  only one way to self-knowledge; in fact, it is not considered so valid  by many teachers I highly respect. It's not that people shouldn't  read, but meditation, or simply being aware of oneself in thought  and action are wonderful and vital ways to expand one's consciousness.  While it is true that these self disciplines can become narcissistic,  that does not invalidate them at all, in my opinion. Human ego is a  problem in all aspects of life, incl. people who show off their  intellect.<br />    Since Prof. Berman uses Dr. Deepak Chopra as the most typical  example of what he feels is New Age nonsense, I would counter that Dr. Chopra's last book, &quot;How To Know God,&quot; is easily the equal of &quot;Twilight&quot; intellectually, and is a wonderful guide for understanding oneself and the various levels of consciousness, even if it isn't correctly titled. Dr. Chopra is a fine mixture of intellectual and  non-intellectual capacities, in my opinion.<br />    The spiritual movements and their adherents are not failures as the  author claims, whatever their faults and shortcomings. I feel that spiritual practices, correctly followed, are more important to humanity's future than studying Voltaire and other great minds. People  are looking for deeper meaning, they are searching for why they are here, how to find inner meaning, and what is beyond death (the author seems to feel that there is nothing - incorrect!).	2001-02-01

As a whole the book exmaines from different angles and points of view the very compelling issues of what is going on with these phenomena and how we can perhaps best approach studying it. Almost all of the chapters are authored by researchers who demonstrate a great deal of knowledge of and insight into the aspect of UFO-logy they discuss.<br />    I would recommend this book only to open-minded readers who have a rather dispassionate interest in the topic. I say this because as one of the chapters I discuss below depicts so well, most people are more concerned with the myth of UFO's rather than the real evidence. I also want to say that the Kirkus review at the top of this page is only too typical of those who want evidence when such &quot;evidence&quot; would never satisfy their preconceived version of reality. Prof. Jacob's compilation to me presents more than enough proof that this issue is real and needs to be seriously addressed by mainstream disciplines.<br />    I will discuss four of the best chapters in &quot;UFO's And  Abductions.&quot;<br />    One chapter in what to me was a rather ironic argument style shows how among science, law, and military intelligence, science is the *least* qualified to investigate UFO's because the data does not fit into any scientific model, and scientists cannot operate w/o such. Because war and defense necessitate avoiding  preconceptions and simply examining the facts dispassionately,  military intelligence is best qualified in the author's opinion.  In my opinion the author did not go far enough, as I find the evidence that the military got technology from the ET's and gave it to industry very believable (Col. Corso's &quot;The Day After  Roswell&quot;, also &quot;The Montauk Project&quot; books).<br />    Budd Hopkins' contribution is a thorough rebuttal to the skeptics'<br />strongly biased attempts to dismiss all abduction accounts as phony. The most salient point he brings out is that many abductees have very clear memories w/o undergoing any hypnosis. He also gives plenty of evidence that hypnosis of abductees does not produce the kind of false memories claimed by debunkers, such as the false memories &quot;remembered&quot; by &quot;victims&quot; of parental abuse.<br />    Psychiatrist John Mack insightfully probes how the abduction phenomenon expands our concepts of reality, particularly the merging of the spirit and material worlds, which are kept separate by the current materialistic worldview. Dr. Mack also feels that the transformations that occur in the lives of abductees are genuine and significant. Of course Dr. Mack is very familiar from personal experience with how the mainstream disciplines react when a researcher attempts to provide evidence that threatens the current belief systems!<br />    The longest and to me the best chapter in this book is called &quot;Lost In The Myths,&quot; which is for the most part a brilliant discussion of first the many values of myths, and then how relevant it is to view the UFO phenomenon from the standpoint of these myths. For example, as we know from Joseph Campbell, story myths can be used to resolve some of the bizarre contradictions in life, so that the resolution is assimilated into the unconscious. UFO's in this context unite technology with magic, advanced science with angelic archetypes who will save a world on the brink of apocalypse (it always is, isn't it?!). The author also compares the transformations experienced by UFO abductees with those who have undergone shamanic initiations. Finally, the author rightly calls on science and the public to separate the myths of UFO's from their actuality, to study the evidence w/o the biases.	2001-01-25
US	53062494	R9KUNE7CMC246	0060648317	688231670	The First and Last Freedom	Books	5	130	135	N	N	A classic among classics	What I am going to write about &quot;The First And Last Freedom&quot; (TFaLF) applies to almost every book Krishnamurti (K) wrote. This was K's first book (1954), and might be his best. It always amazed me that K could say basically the same thing over and over in answer to so many philophical and spiritual questions, and yet it almost always seemed fresh, just as re-reading this first book of his seemed to me this time around.<br />    In philosophical terms I think that it's important to say that what K taught falls into what is termed the &quot;via negativa,&quot; which are paths like Zen that promulgate &quot;the way that is no way,&quot; the system that is no system, that the only way to realize the eternal is to simply *be,* be aware, at every moment, to face life and who one is with absolute honesty, directness, and clarity. Let me also say as caveats that you do not need to want to realize the eternal to study K, and that realizing the &quot;ineffable&quot; is surely a path that many people could care less about! To each his own, for sure.<br />    K is not going to be popular to self-absorbed New Age types who are at times superficially talking about &quot;enlightenment&quot; and &quot;love,&quot;  while other times taking their spiritual temperatures to see if they are aware of themselves enough. On the contrary he often referred to our petty concerns as silly and stupid, not to insult us, but rather to try to effect a kind of catharsis where we simply see ourselves exactly as we are, w/o pretense, w/o belief systems, w/o indentifying with the sundry crutches that many of us surround ourselves with, precisely to avoid just seeing exactly who we are. The term K coined for this constant self awareness was &quot;choiceless awareness.&quot; To my mind choiceless awareness is like the occham's razor of spiritualilty - the clearest, most direct way to realize the eternal is simply to know who you are, at each moment, to face yourself absolutely squarely, w/o judgement,<br />choicelessly, w/o beliefs, w/o any systems of thought or philosophies. I have always seen the truth of his simple saying, &quot;beliefs separate.&quot; Think of how many wars and conflicts there have been because people confuse the symbols that lead to &quot;truth&quot; with the actuality of just seeing what is from moment to moment.<br />    Some of the spiritual teachers these days seem to be saying that the the spiritual path is an easy one, that if we see ourselves as spiritual that is enough, something I call spirituality by proclamation. K himself realized that choiceless awareness can be a very arduous path.<br />    While K's choiceless awareness certainly leads to a life of contemplation, he never advocated withdrawing from society as many such paths of &quot;renunciation&quot; suggest. In fact he said many times, in this book and almost all others, &quot;life is relationship.&quot; Part of the process of knowing oneself is in relationship to other people, individually and collectively. As we observe ourselves choicelessly we must also learn to relate to others in the same way, especially w/o the psychological memory that taints many moments when we are present with another but crowwded with memories of past hurts and desires. I often like to think that all of us simply bounce off or resonate with one another; no one has the absolute truth, and each of us can learn from others in relationship, if we can simply just *be* present.<br />    There has, I guess since the time of the Greeks, been a philosophical conflict between being and becoming. K's teaching emphasizes the former, unequivocably. Whether or not you agree with K, I do feel it is very instructive to see the conflicts and tensions that are created by those who are obsessed with ceaseless doing in order to become, who have to identify with some tribe, nationality, or belief system, who cannot seem to just be who they are w/o such crutches.<br />    On a personal note, I believe (!) that I have evolved more from K's simple path of choiceless awareness than from any other teaching I've studied because I feel that it is the most direct way to whatever truth is possible to realize. Unfortunately I do find it painful to see my own faults and desires so clearly! I am not certain that an adult who comes to K's work can rid themselves of all the psychological garbage so deeply conditioned from the past, to heal oneself completely and in so doing go beyond the ego. I actually prefer Jung's individuation to egolessness.<br />    Of course this one review is not doing justice to K's teaching. Fortunately he wrote more than 30 books, many of which were collections from talks and discussions he had, with many &quot;gurus&quot; and the very important physicist David Bohm. There are also many videos and tapes of fascinating dialogues available from the Krishnamurti Foundation in Ojai, CA. The introduction to TFaLF was written by Alduous Huxley, who therein defined the spiritual crises that K's teaching addressed and outlined K's direct approach to the &quot;truth&quot; as well as anyone who wrote about K.	2000-12-29
US	53062494	R2B21H3DA2DFH9	067169507X	560916915	The Seat of the Soul	Books	4	319	340	N	N	Profound, illuminating insights, tainted by absolutism	It's amazing the divergent opinions one gets from reading the reviews of this book. It's also amazing, at least for me, how a second reading can completely change the way I feel about a book. When I read 'The Seat of the Soul' the first time I was completely turned off by the absolutism that is very apparent on many pages of the book. Yet a second reading changed my opinion of this book dramatically. I will cover the positive, and then the negative. One other point I want to make up front - for those who seek 'scientific proof' for spiritual concepts, I am afraid there  isn't any under the current scientific model. I read this in many  of the reviews.<br />   I believe that Mr. Zukav defines what he intends to cover in the book very well from the outset, which is how to transform  oneself from a five-sensory physical being to a multi-sensory  'spirit in a body.' I believe that he also explains what one can achieve in that transformation, which he calls 'authentic  power,' remarkably well. Starting from evolution, which he asks us to see as souls experiencing multiple lifetimes rather than survival of the fittest physical beings, Zukav does rehash the basic teachings from Eastern religion, such as karma and reincarnation, but with precision and clarity. His insights are not really new, but they are of reference-level quality - if you should ever meet a person who starts to ponder certain aspects of the soul and were thinking of recommending one book, 'The Seat of the Soul' would be one to consider, for sure.<br />    I liked his using the evolution of science as a metaphor for the evolution of our (hopefully) attaining spiritual consciousness as a species, found on p. 67. Indeed quantum physics has shown, no  matter how much the determinists tell us otherwise, that our  consciousness does interact with reality and thus creates it, at  least in a sense. <br />    Finally on the positive side, Zukav's explanation of how the process in which a person observes him/herself in a  non-judgemental way is, next to Krishnamurti's ('The First  and Last Freedom' and many other books) 'choiceless awareness,'  the best I've encountered, and again all I say is that I do  believe that if you follow the process he outlines you will attain higher levels of consciousness. The chapter entitled 'Illusion' is especially good, the way he interweaves that while we do need to learn lessons and know who we are at the deepest possible levels, from a broader perspective it really is an illusion! It is not easy to explain this paradox, but Zukav succeeds well.    <br />    Yet as I stated at the outset, the first time I read the book I was totally turned off by the unfortunate absolutism that permeates much of the writing. I agree with the reviewer  who asked 'how does he know,' and another review that stated  that he is uncomfortable with 'mystery and ambiguity.' This quest  for absolute certainty is perhaps my biggest 'beef' with many New Age writers, and it diminishes the insights of 'The Seat of the Soul.'<br />    I will give just one example. I don't think anyone would  disagree that in general we get what we put out, but it is  not an absolute truth. I have experienced over and over that  life gives me *not* what I put out, but rather what I need to learn.  I often project a lot of anger, and what I receive is not anger,  but rather good feelings, which shows me that my projection is  not the way the world is. But by observing it, 'choicelessly,'  as Zukav and Krishnamurti teach, at least I transcend it to a  certain extent.<br />    I could give many other examples of general truths turned into absolutes, but suffice it to say that Mr. Zukav tends to use expressions like 'in all cases,' 'always,' and other absolutisms carelessly. On p. 53, while discussing reverence in a very meaningful way, he states that a  reverent person 'harms nothing.' Excuse me, even vegetarians do harm.  I would prefer him discussing this point using terms like ahimsa, which more accurately conveys the idea of 'least harm.'<br />    At the beginning of the book Mr. Zukav claims that 'there is no such thing as an expert on the human experience.' Perhaps he should have heeded his own truth in certain wordings in this otherwise  fine book.	2000-12-11
US	53062494	R2HV9HX01RB0QQ	0252064364	219143166	Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method (Illini Books)	Books	4	56	61	N	N	Very valuable discussion of science, method, technology-STS	Very valuable discussion of science; science, technology, &amp; society (STS)<br />    I consider this short book by Professor Bauer a must read for any  person, scientist or non-scientist, who wants a concise but thorough  discussion of the way science works, and of the myth, really ideal, of the scientific method, and most importantly, of what the author calls STS:  science, technology, and society. I found the book remarkable because  Professor Bauer is a practicing scientist, yet he delineates a philosophy  of science from a very objective, dispassionate point of view. While  he rightly praises science much in the last chapter, most of the rest  of the book focuses not only on the limitations of science and scientific  knowledge, but which sciences really are and are not scientific as he  defines it. Clearly the fact that Professor Bauer has been the dean of  arts and sciences at Virginia Tech has given him a balance between  science and the arts, and has allowed him to see science both as an  insider and an outsider. <br />    Thus the main thrust of the book is to show that what is most vital  for the layperson is not to attempt to become &quot;scientifically literate,&quot; which the author claims would be a very time-consuming task, even for a college student, but rather to see that science is a human activity whose theories and models are limited not only because scientists are human, but because almost without exception scientific &quot;truths&quot; are at some point superseded by better &quot;truths,&quot; a process which repeats itself ad infinitum. It is therefore far better for the layperson to try to understand science's relationship to technology and society. The book does cover the relationship between science and technology well, but the author seems to be content to let the reader explore science's relationship to society through other sources, which I did not see in the references. Still, this is a very minor shortcoming in my view because of themany great insights and sources which he does provide.<br />    A key point stressed by Prof. Bauer in different contexts is that the power of science is that it is agreed on by consensus, but that does not always mean that the consensus is right, again because humans are fallible, and because data is *always* interpreted according to a theory or some other bias. The author, as have many other philosophers of science, refutes the common belief that in science knowledge is<br />gained exclusively by strict Baconian impartial induction. Examples are cited where scientists could not accept data obtained wholly by scientific methods because it didn't fit their prejudices.<br />    The chapter called &quot;The So-Called Scientific Method&quot; is  the best I've read on why the empirical scientific method, while a  wonderful ideal to strive for, is nevertheless a myth. Prof. Bauer  makes many important points, such as that some sciences (physics) are theory-driven, while other sciences are observation-driven (geology); some sciences can make precise theories through specific experiments (physics and chemistry), while other sciences (cosmology and paleoanthropology) cannot run experiments and are thus very &quot;data deficient.&quot; As well chemistry, Prof. Bauer's specialty, is itself sub-divided into disciplines that work according to different methodolgies.<br />    Another chapter that is also outstanding is the following chapter, &quot;How Science Really Works.&quot; Prof. Bauer uses as the main theme the excellent analogy devised by Michael Polyani of scientific  problem solving as a puzzle of different teams communicating with each  other, getting at the truth, piece by piece, separately but in tandem nevertheless. Another theme that is very helpful in this chapter is the author's cogent distinction between textbook science and frontier science. Textbook science is almost always reliable because it has passed the test of time through repeated verification. On theother hand, frontier science, which is unfortunately what is usually reported in the news precisely because it is &quot;new&quot; and exciting, often turns out to be dead wrong. The chapter also discusses those levels of science between these two &quot;extremes.&quot; After reading this chapter I feel that I now have a much clearer way to assess the truth of whatever science I might be reading about.<br />    There is much more to this book than I can go into here. Again, I recommend it very highly to those who want a clear and insightful perspective on science and STS.	2000-11-02
US	53062494	R7GQH7R8Z5KRM	0743400720	913869672	The Camino	Books	4	10	13	N	Y	Profound book; advise author to seek a more quiet mind	Since &quot;The Camino&quot; is itself a very personal book, I feel that the only way I can review it is to be personal as well.<br />  I am not a fan of Ms. MacClaine's, though I have been very impressed by the few of her movies I've seen. One time I was very tired traveling on a plane somewhere overseas, and though I wanted to sleep, I simply could not stop watching a movie I really did not want to watch, called &quot;Madame Sousatzka,&quot; because Ms. MacClaine's performance was so magnetizing and compelling. I was very glad to find out that she won a Golden Globe for it.<br />  I am totally turned off by the cult of celebrity, and I found the parts of this book where the author went through some very trying times because of her celebrity to be weird and disturbing, yet from what she wrote she handled the weirdness well. I had thought that in Europe people were less bamboozled by celebrity than in the US, but apparently I was mistaken.<br />  I got a tremendous amount out &quot;The Camino&quot;, and am appreciative to the author for that. I feel that each of us on the spiritual path has some or perhaps a lot of the truth, and we bounce off each other on the quest for higher consciousness. No one has anything close to the &quot;whole truth,&quot; but in &quot;The Camino&quot; I found a lot of candor, wisdom, humor, pithy insights, food for thought, along with a fine travelogue of what the author experienced, both internally and externally.<br />  I have traveled a lot and have grown spiritually from those experiences, and I've also done a number of long distance events to get the endorphins going. Yet I resonate better with the simple knowing that reincarnation and karma are basic laws of life's evolution. I prefer to be present and aware in this life, and not be preoccupied so much about the past, or what happened in Atlantis and Lemuria. I also know how to transcend space time, but again, only the space time in this life. I do not find it helpful to ponder thatat some level all my lifetimes are going on at the same time.<br />  Thus I only resonated partially with what the author wrote about her regressions to her past lives, which I feel she over-stresses in her books, as well to those places in the distant past where mankind  might have lived in a &quot;Garden of Eden.&quot; I did get a lot from her discussions  about androgyny in Lemuria and &quot;sex divisions&quot; in Atlantis. Whatever the veracity of what she experienced in her &quot;dream visions&quot; in those places, I felt that the insights about sex and the quest for wholeness she gained from them were quite accurate.<br />  My basic point of contention with the author's path is that she seems to be on an endless quest for some kind of absolute truth through endless physical and mental activity (to say nothing of her many incarnations), and she never seems to attain it, no matter how much seeking she does. At the beginning of her walk on the Camino, her angel<br />guide Ariel tells her that the path is the goal, but she keeps missing that crucial point, which to me is that few if any souls who come to earth become &quot;totally enlightened,&quot; that is, finish the journey, and I don't believe that the &quot;end&quot; is ever achieved by endless &quot;doing&quot; and seeking spiritual experiences. Thus my own suggestion to Ms. MacClaine would be to simply realize how much you do know, how much you have realized, which is considerable, and just quiet your mind and accept where you are, and let go as much as possible. I found myself thinking over and over, Shirley, you've got it, as much as just about anyone can, but then she would start analyzing and intellectualizing her experiences, and seeking more and more of them, and (perhaps) lose it!<br />  And there is no doubt that Ms. MacClaine is ready for quieting her  mind. She mentions on p. 174 the great teacher, Krishnamurti, who  claimed that he could walk for hours without a single thought, surely  a superior state to an endlessly seeking mind that in my opinion can  never satisfy its thirst for knowledge, awareness, or whatever it is  that it/she is seeking. I highly recommend K's first book, &quot;The First And Last Freedom,&quot; to any seekers who want to try to see the folly of this endless quest for &quot;enlightenment,&quot; and just be, w/o the need to become, ceaselessly.<br />  I also do not agree at all that everything in life has meaning, purpose, and that we create our own reality at all times. There is truth in all of these points, but I feel that these are very simplistic New Age notions that seem to satisfy those who have to be certain that they can &quot;know&quot; the truth, the truth about our lives, the truth about the universe (whatever that is - I, a mere mortal, would never claim to understand the &quot;universe&quot;), etc. And Ms. MacClaine's endless search for this impossible &quot;knowing&quot; doesn't even work for her - just read the part of the book where she says that she still feels like a caterpillar waiting to become a butterfly. Personally if I won just one of the awards she has won, or wrote even one international bestseller, or had the phenomenal experiences she's had in her productive life, I would be satisfied.<br />  This is a profound book and I highly recommend it, whatever my judgements!	2000-10-26
US	53062494	R12ZRG5EOB2MCC	0767903439	900427094	The Marriage of Sense and Soul: Integrating Science and Religion	Books	4	25	33	N	N	Excellent in Spirit, poor in science	&quot;Marriage,&quot; as I'll call this book is an excellent, clear  summary of a lot of Wilber's work on transpersonal psychology, esp.  their  levels and dimensions. On the topics of psychology, philosophy,  religion,  and their integration in Lovejoy's &quot;Great Chain of Being,&quot;  I  don't think you'll find any writer more knowledgeable  than Ken Wilber. Yet  I feel the book does not really achieve its  purpose, which is unifying  science and religion.<br />    In discussing religion Wilber does a superb job  of delineating  what religion really needs to be: religion, really the  spiritual  *experience*, is not the literal myths that true believers hang  their  hats on, nor the differing versions of God that separate the  followers  of the almost countless religions and religious concepts in the  world.  Rather, it is the internal process(es) of self-awareness, the   &quot;eye of contemplation,&quot; that can lead one to higher levels, to  God,  Oneness, or whatever you want to call the Intelligence that pervades   everything. I found the discussion of the many subjects that unite  in  Wilber's elucidation of the spiritual journey to be more clear  and concise  in &quot;Marriage&quot; than any of his books I have (tried to)  read since  his groundbreaking first book, &quot;Transformations of   Consciousness.&quot; Sometimes I find Wilber's highly-praised books to be  far too intellectual.<br />    Another outstanding part of this book are  Wilber's excellent definitions of what he calls the &quot;dignity&quot; and  &quot;disaster&quot; of modernity, dignity being the differentiation of the  spheres of art, morals, and  science, followed by the &quot;disaster&quot;  of disassociation, where science has come to claim hegemony over not only  truth but how to discover truth &quot;empirically.&quot; Wilber's  discussions of the idealist, romantic, and  post-modern movements, which  have tried to heal the split, are also  first-rate.          On the other  hand his discussion of science is weak, and to  me it simply doesn't work,  not because his intentions aren't right, but because science simply tends  to be &quot;God-less,&quot; and his arguments to convince scientists are  not convincing, and I don't  agree with the implication that science  somehow has to validate  religious traditions. To me that is conceding far  too much to  science. As well Wilber seems to have little or no feel for  what  scientists do, and perhaps the real purpose of the book is not any   kind of marriage between the two spheres, but rather how to use a   &quot;scientific method&quot; of distilling the wisdom gained from the  world's  mystics (from many different religious traditions), and testing  one's  owns spirituality and good deeds against the experiences of these   mystics. Science as it is practiced today simply does not encompass  these  value spheres, and perhaps it should not, other than the  obvious ethical  cases where scientific knowledge is used for  deleterious purposes.  Strangely enough, the author does not write  a word about such an  &quot;injunction&quot; for science and scientists, though  a major part of  his arguments about science validating religion  evolves from injunctions  that are a vital part of the scientific process.<br />    The point is, the  scientists who try to marry their disciplines with spirituality, like  Deepak Chopra and Larry Dossey, are already  doing a fine job, in my  opinion, and these pathbreakers really dig  into the details of such a  convergence. So why do we need an  intellectual treatise by a non-scientist  which itself gives practically  no details from any scientific discipline  to make the case for  this &quot;marriage?&quot; <br />    To give one  example, Wilber never really defines what he means by evolution. Is he  talking about strict Darwinian evolution or is he talking about spiritual  evolution? The so-called rejection of Darwinian evolution by religion is  overblown in this book.Most  religions accept Darwin's main thesis, that  life has evolved over very long spans of time. What any religious  organization would naturally  reject are the implications of Darwinian  evolution, that life has no  meaning because all life evolved through  chance. Yet I know of not one  organized religion that actually promulgates  what Wilber discusses in  his books: the evolution of the soul, which is  far more important for  humans than the tedious details of physical  evolution. Evolution is a  complicated subject that warrants more words  than I have here.<br />    Perhaps an even better example of a true marriage  between science and religion would be the evidence provided by scientific  research that love  and compassion are actually good for the physical  heart!          It would be very entertaining to read reviews of this book  by some of the spokemen of mainstream science, such as Steven  Weinberg and  the authors of books like &quot;Higher Superstition.&quot; I would  wager  that they would find this book quite amusing. They aren't<br />interested in  merging science with anything, as they are convinced that science has  nothing to do with Spirit or the unity of anything. And I say fine, because  as far as I'm concerned science has no business validating any internal  experience. I'd recommend &quot;Seduced By Science&quot; for a good  discussion against the need in an age dominated by science for scientific  &quot;validatation&quot; of anything spiritual.<br />   In the end I would  highly recommend this book for its content,  regardless whether it achieves  its purpose. But I have found books that  really get down to the nitty  gritty of how science (really modern physics) might parallel religious  traditions more useful in defining a &quot;marriage&quot; of the two  spheres, though in a sense the scope of  this book is far wider. To name 3  of these books, I'd recommend  &quot;The Tao of Physics,&quot;  &quot;The  Self-Aware Universe,&quot; and &quot;Religion And  Science (by Ian  Barbour). Also, John Haught's &quot;God After Darwin&quot; really goes into  the details of how to reconcile religion with science. I do not agree with  Wilber's contention that science is strictly &quot;monological.&quot;	2000-09-20

It was very interesting   to read such a wide variety of mostly thoughtful reviews, mostly positive   and a few negative. Honestly, I found the negative reviews more akin to   some of my own thoughts, simply because I cannot agree with the  &quot;everything  works out if you just have a positive attitude&quot;  slant of this book. I know of people who have refused to sell their ideals  to the system, have tried to &quot;follow their bliss,&quot; and have not  succeeded, and I attribute this as much to the dog-eat-dog mentality of the  business world as to their &quot;negativity.&quot;<br />    If you are a  &quot;mover and a shaker&quot; who wants to find a meaningful way to  channel your talents and energies, then I would highly recommend  this book  to you as inspiration. As other reviewers stated, the book does  not  delineate specific paths for finding meaning in your work. The author  clearly assumes that the reader either has his/her own ideas on what work  would be rewarding, and wrote the book to inspire the reader to &quot;go  for it&quot; through many fine examples of both men and women who in some  cases endured a lot of ups and downs to create the work environment they  could love, and to their credit, an equitable work place for their  employees. The stories in the book of people who sacrificed profit for  employee benefits are very heartening, as are the stories of<br />people who  sacrificed income for &quot;spiritual&quot; satisfaction in their work. And  for those who do want help in finding such a path, the author has a web  site and organization that might be useful, though it does appear that his  service is limited to business leaders, not ordinary workers like most of  us!<br />    As others have written, I found myself very put off by the  constant  mention of what I will call the &quot;H&quot; word, Harvard. The  author overuses it,  along with the mention of other big name schools, as  if he cannot give  up the superiority of those institutions and those who  attend them. If  he had moderated his repetition of cases related to  &quot;big-name&quot; schools, along with the glee over the  &quot;success&quot; of the people depicted, I would have found the book  much more likeable.<br />    To write a book such as this an author would  clearly have to question some of what constitutes &quot;success&quot; in  the world, yet Mr. Albion neither questions nor seems to have a problem  with some of the ridiculous excesses of capitalism, i.e., the compulsion to  be &quot;successful,&quot; along with the manic busy-ness of so many  people, which somehow automatically equates to self-importance and  self-worth. Over and over again the people depicted in the book are  workaholics who probably have no time to question any of what I consider to  be (at least partially) some of the fallacious underpinings of capitalism  and busy-ness. However, to each is own, I get worth from questioning, and  others derive it from being busy all the time.<br />    I agree with the  reviewers who found the quotes by famous, successful people, which are  offset in bold on practically every page of the book, to be &quot;too  much&quot; and distracting, yet what I found expedient was to ignore them  as much as possible the first time I read the book, and then while skimming  the book a second time concentrate on them. I found this quite rewarding  and I even made a list of many pithy quotes I liked, and I appreciate the  research the author did to compile such a useful list. Indeed these often  inspiring quotes are as if a book within a book, and best of all, almost  all of the people quoted themselves went against the tide to create their  own meaning and &quot;success&quot; in life.	2000-08-20
US	53062494	R28TVS7MJQDMCS	0813367239	333614092	God After Darwin: A Theology Of Evolution	Books	4	65	78	N	N	Very profound, thoughtful, challenging; slightly flawed	Thanks to other reviews on amazon.com, I came across the author's works, and I am very glad I did. His books are very deep, profound, and thought-provoking. Haught is a propoent of the &quot;engagement&quot; of  science and religion, as opposed to the separatist position of writers such  as Phillip Johnson (&quot;Darwin On Trial&quot;). He is the only theologian  I've come across who faces the challenges posed by Darwinian evolution  absolutely squarely, refusing to try to defend what he feels is the  antiquated theological notion of God as an intelligent designer of an  orderly and purposeful universe. Indeed, evolution by natural selection, as  well as the laws of physics, do show us a very chaotic, entropic, often  destructive, cruel world. <br />    In addition to the difficult task of  defining God in terms of evolution, Haught also attempts to refute the  strict materialistic scientism of Dennett and Dawkins. Of course, it is  very unlikely that his arguments would sway an atheist in the least, which  is to be expected. &quot;God After Darwin&quot; is thus clearly for those  who want to find purpose and faith in their lives and in God in a world so  profoundly influenced, for good and for bad, by Darwin.<br />    I feel that  Haught succeeds admirably in these very difficult tasks. I can only imagine  his struggle to admit the truth of evolution and how to define a valid  theology in concordance with it, instead of denying it. While reading this  book the careful reader will sense the author's struggle, and if you agree  with him, his victory!<br />    Haught defines these concepts to find purpose  in an evolutionary world: a) kenosis - Divine emptying; God does not  control Its creation, allowing creation to come to It; b) information,  which coordinates parts into wholes, and the emergence of increasing beauty  (he uses Whitehead's writing to define beauty), through novelty,  complexity, and the contrasts of opposites; c) a definition of time a la  Teilhardde Chardin's Omega point, where the future, a theology of hope, is  the &quot;ultimate&quot; purpose of evolution. Haught refers to the future  as the key to finding purpose in evolution many times, perhaps too many. He  makes a fine definition of community as groups of people, of widely  differing cultures and belief systems, working together to manifest God's  Plan, the increase of beauty.<br />    Haught refutes scientific materialism  by pointing to evolution's clear depiction of increasing complexity in  living forms, which he feels points to the necessity that beings as  conscious and evolved as we are would &quot;evolve&quot; - I use quotes  because I don't think that humans evolved from apes w/o an intervention of  some &quot;God.&quot; He also cites recent discoveries in astrophysics to  underscore the fact that the emergence of sentient life, really human life,  was indeed no accident.<br />    Haught also refutes the dualism that is  inherent in many religions, which depicts maeterial existence as an  accident, where the goal is to see our lives as meaningful only in escaping  the physical, returning to the timeless spiritual realms beyond the grave.  Again, the argument is that we must live in the here and now, and work  towards the &quot;glorious&quot; future I discussed above.<br />    I did have  problems with several areas in the book, however. First, I feel that one  has to find a balance as a spiritual being having a physical experience. I  have always found the expression, &quot;be in the world but not of it&quot;  to be a good way to live, because it reminds me that physical life is  indeed a &quot;soul school,&quot; too temporary for one to be so concerned  about a &quot;limitless&quot; future, which the author seems to use as a  crutch to explain away the awful suffering in the world, including wars and  murders on a scale that even God must have difficulty comprehending (!),  inhabited by a schizophrenic species which seems to multiply w/o restraint,  and so on. I also found Chapter 10, where the author goes on for pages and  pages trying to come up with a logical reason for what kind of  &quot;subjective consciousness&quot; existed in the universe before  sentient beings (esp. humans) came along, to be superfluous. And that is  surprising, because elsewhere he  appropriately and humbly does &quot;let  go, and let God,&quot; in acknowledging the mysteries of the universe.  Finally, I do believe that the &quot;true&quot; evolution is a Divine Plan  of spiritual evolution, especially as concerns humans; ironically, I found  no mention of this in the book. The author seems to have rejected such  metaphysics, as have most scientists today.	2000-07-26
US	53062494	R1QXUWVU5YGURH	0395907713	751499058	Sparks of Genius: The Thirteen Thinking Tools of the World's Most Creative People	Books	5	72	76	N	N	Brilliant; Outstanding; Better than 5-star book	It is such a pleasure to write a review of a book of this caliber. I don't have to balance what is good with what is not so good, because &quot;Sparks of Genius&quot; is an excellent, superb book, from start to finish. I would  have only one small addition to one of the chapters, which I will mention  below.<br />    I think that &quot;Sparks of Genius&quot; is the first book I  have ever read on the subject of how to develop genius, but I cannot  imagine a better complilation of what it takes to foster and inspire genius  and creativity in people. The main reason for this is that the authors base  their material on how creative people in the arts, sciences, etc., acquire  and develop their skills, and every chapter except the last one  (appropriately) are full of firsthand examples from people of genius and  creativity in (almost!) all walks of life. Yet the authors themselves  exhibit their own kind of genius in organizing the material, writing  chapter after chapter with genuine vision and clarity, and most  importantly, after intellectually explaining &quot;sparks&quot; such as  observing, imaging, analyzing, and empathizing, give specific, generally  uncomplicated, exercises on how to develop these skills.<br />    Throughout  the book the authors demonstrate that people in very diverse walks of life  exhibit the same &quot;sparks of genius&quot; in their work, which I find  quite inspiring in itself. In this way they themselves exemplify the value  of &quot;synthesis,&quot; perhaps the key that links all the methods they  depict.<br />    The book is a call to &quot;rethink thinking,&quot; to teach  cross-discipline learning, and I feel that the methods discussed in the  book, and then discussed specifically in the context of education in the  final chapter, would be invaluable as educational tools. I believe that if  children's education could be fostered along the lines of these tools of  creative genius, if children could be taught to use their own internalresources instead of relying on the obvious external garbage such as TV and  video games, the improvement to society would be tremendous.<br />    My  favorite chapter in the book is called &quot;Empathizing,&quot; where the  authors discuss what artists and scientists do to go inside of whomever or  whatever they are portraying (actors), drawing (artists), treating  (physicians), as well as other real-life examples.<br />    My only small  addition to &quot;Sparks of Genius&quot; would be in the penultimate  chapter, called &quot;Synthesizing,&quot; some mention of the  &quot;gestalt&quot; in experiencing the whole in music, art, etc. I liked  this term from personal experience and from books on gestalt therapy that  came out some time ago, and it's a very intuitive concept that fits in well  with the chapter's discussion.<br />    I cannot recommend this book highly  enough!	2000-05-24
US	53062494	RR156WFDNSLOB	0801847664	647051713	Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science	Books	3	20	85	N	N	Well-written, effective;pedantic; too protective of science	I am going to have to agree, at least in part, with the reviewer who called this work a &quot;sad, little book.&quot; &quot;Higher Superstition&quot; is not a trivial book by any means, and it is very well  written, yet it is also over-written, with too many scholarly words, as if  the authors want to prove that as scientists they are the equal of any  teacher in the humanities. The problem is that the authors choose easy  targets and pound their points into the ground. Sometimes their arguments  are<br />powerful and effective; other arguments are simply very pedantic.<br />     I have no problems with the arguments in &quot;Higher Superstitions&quot;  that claim that certain scholars of the left, postmodern, and feminist  persuasions have made a travesty of political correctness in academia, and  that science has become in some senses an unwarranted target for those  criticisms because of its power in today's world. It is no secret that the  academic environment is pervaded by many scholars who try to<br />carve out  their niche's by writing flowery tomes that say very little other than to  flout a widespread knowledge of various disciplines, some of which the  writers know very little. In this regard I will agree with the authors'  criticisms of &quot;Science And Power,&quot; which I found unreadable in  the extreme.<br />    I found other criticisms by the authors far less  palatable. For example, their point-by-point critiques of sentences in  Sandra Harding's works are at times incredibly trivial; e.g., it is very  widely acknowledged that physics is the leading science, and since science  is the &quot;weapon&quot; they claim it is, then what difference does it  make that so few people understand physics, and why waste words on this  point? Other criticisms of Harding are equally trivial, and yet the authors  do acknowledge that women have been discriminated against in science since  its inception, which is the real point, isn't it? They clearly want to slamthe door on any outsider's attempt to point out certain problems in science  and the scientific world view. The problem is, they don't bother to address  the more valid criticisms of science by trained scientists, which I mention  below.<br />    Science is very patriarchal and reductionistic, and for a good  argument against so-called &quot;theories of everything&quot; that could  cost taxpayers billions of dollars for little practical results, read  &quot;Pythagoras' Trousers.&quot; That author can argue the science, and  she can argue about the history of science. What the authors of  &quot;Higher Superstition&quot; don't understand is that when a discipline  is so entrenched in a way of looking at things, it is almost impossible to  see how some new blood could improve it, and that it will take some time.  Perhaps with more women involved in science we will see less weapons of  mass destruction and more utilitarian, healing products, and yes, new kinds  of science. Who knows, the imbalance has only recently even been  acknowledged, much less addressed.<br />    I will probably be labeled  &quot;New Age&quot; for some of my comments above, and so be it, I am a  &quot;New Ager.&quot; Yet I am trained in computer science, I've been a  programmer for years, I've studied (the) calculus, etc., and I feel that is  at least somewhat &quot;scientific.&quot; The authors heap so much  criticism on what they flippantly call &quot;New Age&quot; this or that,  without even defining what &quot;New Age&quot; is, I would have to write a  completely separate review to address that issue. It's only too obvious why  they don't really attack what I consider to be the very valid criticisms of  patriarchal science of such fine, credentialed writers as Fritjof Capra,  Andrew Weil, and Deepak Chopra, to name but three of many professionally  trained scientists who have the integrity to point out the severe  limitations of many modalities of western, reductionist science, which is  extolled in this book as an unparalleled achievement in the history of  mankind, an arrogant claim which seems to put science above reproach,  unless of course, you are a scientist! The reason they don't might be  because the targets they would attack could easily defend their  positions.<br />    To support the above, and speaking from personal  experience, there are certain aspects of medical science that aren't so  great. I've had some colossal failures using expensive treatments by MD's,  and far greater successes with less costly alternative treatments. Again, I  do not have the space to develop my points more fully, and I only mention  this in defense of the &quot;New Age&quot; point of view the authors attack  so condescendingly, to put it mildly. Science's failure to do much about  cancer, AIDS, and other diseases, the billions of dollars spent on this  so-called &quot;science,&quot; the fraud of the so-called &quot;war&quot;  on this or that disease, and the incorrigibly expensive costs of ANY  mainstream treatment for serious diseases, are indefensible, if you ask me.  And that, I am afraid, indeed requires a more feminine, compassionate  &quot;science,&quot; which I will concede as a man.	2000-05-23

Barbour, with some validity, takes on books such as &quot;The Tao of  Physics,&quot; and criticizes what he feels is overstressing the  similarities between physics and mysticism. Again, there are many  references provided that are well worth further study.<br />  As I stated  above, I found the discussion of religion less appealing, precisely because  it is far too intellectual, and is limited to what I will call  &quot;human-only&quot; theses, and there are so many models and points of  view presented I found it impossible to keep them straight. The author does  state repeatedly that religion is &quot;interpretive experience,&quot; yet  he seems to feel that hundreds of intellectual explanations and theories of  religion and God are what is called for to be &quot;coherent;&quot;  however, the effect to me what was basically the opposite.<br />  The  explanation of Whitehead's main theses is good in developing what the  author calls &quot;process theology.&quot; Yet I am sorry to say that I got  the impression that the author, who uses the word God over and over, has  himself little experience of God other than what he has read from  philosophers and the Old and New Testaments, i.e., intellectual only. He  barely mentions reincarnation and karma, and clearly doesn't accept them.  To me they are vital concepts in understanding the way &quot;God&quot; is,  or I would say the laws of the &quot;Universe,&quot; and certainly in  trying to understand what the relationship of our souls is to the  temporary, material existence. There is virtually no discussion of death in  this book other than vague references to Christian doctrine, from what I  remember, and to me a thorough discussion is absolutely crucial in any book  about comparative religion.<br />  The author himself admits that models  don't represent literal (physical) reality, and I would add that they also  do not represent spiritual reality, and thus are overrepresented here in  the latter context.<br />  Mr. Barbour also supports, among many suggested  models, modes of interaction as well as dealing with the obvious  differences in scope between the two disciplines, with which I agree. He  maintains that the two disciplines in principle occupy difference realms of  knowledege, really experience, and thus he supports the  &quot;Independence&quot; model, in order to avoid the kind of confusion  that arises when religious leaders try to defend their beliefs with the  latest findings in science. As for interaction, Barbour supports the  &quot;Dialogue&quot; model, not only between religion and science, but  among different religions, eschewing any claim of exclusive truth by any  group.<br />  My criticisms of this book are perhaps harsh given its amazing  scope. I do recommend it as a valuable resource.

The book &quot;The Boys On The Tracks&quot; is the real  story of what happened in Arkansas, and is endorsed by Linda Ives, the  mother of one of the boys who was killed and placed on the railroad tracks  on that fateful night in August, 1987. Mrs. Ives is the central character  in this book. The reader is presented with not only the entire story of the  unfathomable corruption, but much of this incredibly detailed story is as  if from Ives' diaries, written or mental.<br />    The author, Mara Leveritt,  takes the reader from the time the two boys are killed, through the  complete story of what Ives goes through to try to find out the truth (and  she still hasn't found the truth about what happened that night). First, we  encounter the unbelievable and outrageous behavior and incompetence of the  Arkansas State coroner, Famy Malek, who is protected countless times by top  state officials despite absolutely false determinations he makes. Malek  rules the boys deaths suicides from drug intoxication, and it takes the  Ives family a long time to prove this false due to lack of cooperation from  Arkansas officials. Only this is just the beginning of the obstructions of  justice the<br />Ives face.<br />    Then we see that, at least in part,  practically the entire state of Arkansas's legal and law enforcement  agencies are rampant with corruption, to the point that felons hold  high-level positions in government and law enforcement. Clearly these state  officials will go to any length to prevent the truth of the boys's deaths  from being revealed. A very prominent figure in this aspect of the story is  Dan Harmon, a county prosecuting attorney. Harmon brutally beats people up,  incl. his wives and ex-wives, and even steals confiscated drugs, and yet is  held completely unaccountable for his actions and is returned to office  again and again. Harmon is eventually and surprisingly convicted of certain  offenses, but any crimes related to events around the time of the boys's  deaths are deliberately ignored. Oddly enough, though not at all surprising  once you read the unbelievable things revealed over and over in this book,  Harmon is initially depicted as an ally of Linda Ives!<br />    Of course the  biggest, most outrageous part of this story is the cover-up of large-scale  drug smuggling done through the Mena Airport, incl. the Barry Seal story,  which is never dealt with by Arkansas officials. The details of this horror  story are so phenomenal that you have to wonder how the people involved in  these crimes can take part in such corruption and hypocrisy, and do their  misdeeds with such impunity!<br />    If you want the complete story, this is  undoubtedly the book to read. If you don't have time to read this very  well-written, 300+ page book, see &quot;The Clinton Chronicles&quot; and  the more accurate (according to the participants) &quot;Obstruction of  Justice&quot; videos.	2000-04-27

The author states and re-states his position many times with good effect, which is that we are better served by keeping religion and science separate.  Science is effective because it is narrow; its  methods give excellent results when they can be empirically validated.  Religion, Godlberg argues, needs to stress its core message: humility,  faith, and values.<br />    The author takes on scientific hubris very  directly and challenges some of the leading physicists of our time, who  claim that they can understand the &quot;mind of God&quot; if only enough  money is spent on multi-billion dollar projects such as the supercollider.  He also argues with clarity and simplicity that there are limits to the  claims that we are nothing more than our physical components, our genes,  DNA, etc.<br />    As well Professor Goldberg argues effectively that  religious leaders should not jump on the scientific bandwagon to prove that  the Bible is a scientific text, or that the Big Bang proves some point in  the Creation story. He simply repeats that religion and religious leaders  should stick to religions' core values, which I stated above.<br />    My only  real disaagreement with the author is that it is somewhat simplistic to say  that religions must stress their core teachings. There are so many  religions, and so many sub-groups within religions, that religion is not a  unity. The various religions send mixed signals about their core teachings,  often promote fear of God, and God Itself is so difficult to define,  especially as defined by organized religions. Science has capitalized on  these disagreements by putting on a united front, where at times scientists  claim that they can explain everything, even to the point of meaning in  life. In fact, there are wide disagreements among scientists on many  issues, such as interpretations of quantum mechanics.<br />    What I liked  most about this book are the excellent references in the footnotes. I have  learned about many fine books on the science vs. religion debate, such as  &quot;Pythagoras' Trousers,&quot; &quot;Higher Superstition,&quot; and  several John Polkinghorne's most recent books.	2000-04-26

To the author, this ethic, this unity, is not to be  obtained through a unification of the sundry religious traditions, a  merging of their commonalities. She feels that there is no need to resolve  these differences; to her, there are simply part of the Mystery of  existence. To her the unity we can feel, a reverence for life, can emerge  from realizing that all physical life is made from the same basic building  blocks, that life has emerged and developed in basically the same patterns  throughout evolution; again, physical evolution. Thus most of the book  consists of explanations of the emergence of the basic building blocks of  physical life and how life works. <br />                       I was very  impressed with the author's humility before the larger questions of life,  and what she describes as the &quot;epiphany&quot; she got when she  realized that she did not need to uncover answers to the Big Questions, the  seeming meaningless of life that scientists such as Steven Weinberg have  stated they perceive, ironically as they claim to understand more of the  Universe. Her humility and reverence are indeed true religious emotions,  whatever her feelings about Deism, the Creator of the Universe - she  deliberately does not take a position on whether or not there is a Creator,  however. Her comments about empathy and compassion are also, to me, very  indicative of a religious mind, whatever her context.<br />    I was equally  impressed with the clarity and simplicity of her explanations of the  origins and development of life, sex, sexuality, multicellularity, and  death. These chapters make the book worth reading, regardless of how the  reader feels about her metaphysic, the philosophy towards life that she has  developed from her work as a biologist.<br />    Yet personally I cannot agree  with her basic premise, because I feel that physical life is just a shadow  of something far greater and more vast, Spirit, and whether the existence  of this deeper Force can be &quot;proven&quot; by science is irrelevant to  me. Physical life is a miracle, but it's quite temporary, and it feeds off  itself in the most bizarre way. There is to me a rather profound paradox,  that nothing can live unless something dies for the former's consumption. I  can in no way just dismiss Mysteries such as the latter and death simply as  Mysteries beyond anything we can prove, explain, or try to comprehend. I  need a different metaphysic, one that expands my consciousness beyond the  limitations of the physical.	2000-04-26

I like this book a lot, as I used to like Three Dog Night's (TDN) music when I was in high school. It is a very thorough, gutsy, honest expose' by Chuck Negron, one of the original singers in the band, and the lead on the unforgettable &quot;Joy to the World.&quot; The book depicts the author's life from birth through an incredible life of basketball, then rock music, stardom, during which he became addicted to sundry drugs. The whole sordid tale of Negron's life as a washed up heroin junkie is laid bare here with total candor. His drug problems cost him several marriages, millions of dollars, his sanity, and many others things detailed in the book. Negron's ability to &quot;come clean&quot; with all the ups and downs of his life (and the lives of others he hurt, even ruined) is extraordinary.<br /> However, one negative side of the book to me is Negron's seeming compulsion/addiction to tell it like it is/was, at times tactlessly. For example, I think he could have lessened some of the harser criticisms of the other 2 singers in TDN.<br /> Negron's story of being redeemed by God, as he names It seems miraculous, and the singer has certainly tried hard to make amends for his past sins.	2000-01-05

I   would suspect tnat the book would show more  humanity than Dr. Stevenson's  rather dry accounts  of his cases, but most importantly, if a   conventional, rational thinking person needs to travel to various countries  to find &quot;proof&quot; of  reincarnation to convince them, it is  unlikely  that they would ever be convinced that  reincarnation is a  fact.<br />    &quot;Old Souls&quot; is easy and pleasureable to read,  and I  agree with tne reviewers who compliment Mr.  Shroder on the travelogues of  his and Dr.  Stevenson's tales in Lebanon and India. He very  effectively  describes the conditions in the two  countries, clearly and honestly, and  conveys both  the terrible effect that many wars have had on Lebanon, as  well as the rather gruesome and  awful poverty in India. The author also  depicts  the drama of meeting people in the flesh who can clearly remember  what I believe is a fact, their lives in other bodies. There are several   cases in &quot;Old Souls&quot; that I feel would convince  anyone with an  open mind that reincarnation is  true.<br />    &quot;Old Souls&quot; in a way  is an attempt to  vindicate Dr. Stevenson, who comes across as a  very  noble, persistent, but frustrated scientist,  largely ignored by the  mainstream scientific  community despite thousands of solid cases in many   countries which point to reincarnation. And in a  way the books succeeds in  vindicating Dr.  Stevenson.<br />    But unfortunately Mr. Shroder himself,  typical  of people indoctrinated in cultures which reject  reincarnation,  can never seem to accept it, and  his objections are also the same reasons  we hear  over and over, e.g., since he can't remember past  lives, he can't  accept it; since science, which he  obviously accepts as the arbiter of  truth, cannot  &quot;prove&quot; reincarnation, it can't be true; and so   on. I found this aspect of the book quite  tiresome. I must wonder if there  can ever be  &quot;scientific proof&quot; of reincarnation, the soul,   Karma and so on. And I must ask, &quot;Who cares?&quot; I  certainly do  not, I do not consider scientific  materialism the arbiter of ANY truths  when it  comes to metaphysical questions.<br />    So as I understand it,  &quot;old souls&quot; like the  author's do indeed keep reincarnating until  they  learn that evolving as souls through multiple  human experiences is  indeed our true mission. I  can't &quot;prove&quot; that either. There are  simply some  truths that we must come to by non-rational  methods and  experiences, and it's really sad that rational proof is the only way so  many people can  decide on the veracity of crucial matters.<br />    God is an  experience, not an experiment.	1999-12-18

The author is a journalist who decides to seek  spiritual awareness by becoming a &quot;spiritual tourist.&quot; He travels to a number of countries and  tries to get at the truth of many different teachings and teachers, by  directly encountering their homebases and their teachings, and even the  teachers themselves, when possible. One of the best aspects of the book are  not only the descriptions of the outer experiences of the author, who is  clearly a  fine writer of travelogues, but perhaps more importantly,  his  inner experiences, which are depicted with great candor and clarity.  Finally, in each chapter the reader  is given more than adequate background  for each spiritual  teaching and/or teacher, which often compliment the   author's experiences.<br /> The book starts with the author's encounters  with Benjamin Creme, who for more than 20 years has been telling the world  that the Matreiya's appearance is imminent. The author seems to like Creme,  but rightfully so comes away very skeptical about the latter's teachings,  since clearly the World Teacher has not &quot;appeared&quot; yet.  <br />  The author's travels in India comprise the  vast majority of the book. He  visits many ashrams,  such as Sri Aurobindo's and Sai Baba's. The narrative   of what the author experiences at the latter's ashram  are the best in the  book, in my opinion. The author  very candidly describes the rigidity of  the atmosphere inside the ashram, while contrasting that with the  circus-like atmosphere of the world outside of the compound, where many  vendors hawk goods and lure customers by repeating Sai Baba's name, like a  mantra. Mr. Brown comes away from the Sai Baba experience disappointed, not  only by its weirdness, but because the Master ignores him when he gets  close enough to  offer Sai Baba a imploring letter asking for  &quot;salvation,&quot;  whatever it is that the Master can offer!<br /> My  only realcriticism of this fine book is that the author, while to his  credit attempting to cram a lot of material about many different spiritual  paths and teachers into a limited number of chapters, sometimes puts too  much info in one chapter, and in some chapters there is simply too much for  the reader. The  chapter about the history of the Theosophical Society,   which he overdetails in a discussion mainly about  Krishnamurti, himself  once proclaimed &quot;World Teacher,&quot; has  way too much information.  Even though I am very familiar  with this history, I feel that he is trying  to cover too  much in one chapter.<br /> I recommend this book for its  honesty, objectivity, and marvelous descriptions of places and experiences.  The bibliography is also an excellent reference list for the spiritually  curious. Yet I wonder if the author really  &quot;got it&quot; as he seems  to claim at the end of the book - that it doesn't really matter where you  travel on the outside, it's the inner that you need to stay grounded in.	1999-09-18

Mr. Shanks, clearly an expert in the history of the Dead Sea Scrolls, takes the reader from the first finds in 1947, through the amazing stories of how the scrolls were  obtained, mostly from the dealer, Kando, and significantly, perhaps,  coinciding with the creation of the modern state of Israel and its initial  struggles; continuing finds, where the bedouins usually triumphed over the  archaeologists; the controversial delays in publishing translations by the  Catholic-controlled  translating team, and finally, what the scrolls  (might) mean for Jews and Christians.<br />    I enjoyed the chapters  discussing whether Qumran was actually an Essene community, and whether the  scrolls were really composed there. The chapter on the relevance of the  scrolls to the Old Testament is one of the best in the book, and some  consider it the most important aspect of the find. The conclusion that the  Dead Sea Scrolls prove that the Greek Septuagint translation of the  original Hebrew is closer than the current Hebrew version in certain  passages of the Bible fascinated me, as a (former) linguist.<br />    While  Mr. Shanks pushed hard for completion of the translations for many years,  here he doesn't want to rock the boat of anyone's belief systems and faith.  I will admit that my criticisms may be irrelevant since my comments below  may have nothing to do with what the author intended to accomplish, but I  feel that it's at least as important to question belief systems rather than  simply to detail and &quot;validate&quot; them.<br />    In the chapter  &quot;Undermining Christian Faith - of a Certain Kind,&quot;  he does  indeed prove that the scrolls preface the concept of Jesus as a &quot;son  of God.&quot; In doing this he mentions the fact that in the 4  &quot;chosen&quot; gospels of the Christianity there is little similarity  as to when Jesus actually became the &quot;son of God.&quot; It would seem  that a more important issue is why people base their faith on inconsistent  material of so-called &quot;messangers of the Lord.&quot; This is but one  of a number of such examples in both official versions of Judaeo-Christian  texts, and of course in this case many would rather feel that everyone is a  &quot;son (or daughter!) of God,&quot; and that no one person is the most  &quot;chosen&quot; one.<br />    Another statement in this chapter is that  &quot;Nothing mitigates against the 'uniqueness of Jesus'.&quot; Well,  maybe not in the official texts, but there is plenty of evidence that many  other religions had similiar &quot;sons of God,&quot; born of a  &quot;virgin,&quot; who died on a cross, were resurrected, and were thus  &quot;Saviours.&quot; <br />    This book is a fine overview of the subject of  the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the bibliography provides many references for  additional study. But I feel that a far deeper questioning of what people  base their faiths on is the real requirement for our times, and neither   this book nor apparently the scrolls themselves - if we reject  Barbara  Thiering's work and others who have disputed the official interpretations -  are going to bring these questions to bare. I feel that we need a more  universal Religion rather than the continuation of the status quo  religions, which prepetuate the divisive, tribal nature of humanity.	1999-06-18
US	53062494	R2UOIXVIB2BM8R	0140192964	251098633	The Great Year: Astrology, Millenarianism, and History in the Western Tradition (Arkana)	Books	4	23	24	N	N	Excellent book, but too &quot;materialistic&quot; for me	I do not have this book at present, thus I can only write what I remember. <br />    Overall I would say that anyone interested in history, particularly milleniarism, should read/buy &quot;The Great Year.&quot; The book is an  engaging, comprehensive survery of milleniarism along with a  great deal of  history to boot.<br />    &quot;The Great Year&quot; and &quot;The Great  Week&quot; are views of history that have been accepted by many  cultures/religions - Hebrews, Christians, Platonists, etc. According to  this view, history is predetermined and fulfills itself in phases of  various lengths. In the Hebrew book of  Jubilees a &quot;year&quot; is 49  years, for example. In another culture a 4-phase  historical cycle may  involve completely different time scales. The  Hebrews tended to see their  &quot;Great Year&quot; cycles as successive renewals  with God's covenant  through prophets like Moses, with alternating cycles  where the covenant is  broken and people suffer, the explanation given  as not following God's  laws. Everyone is certainly familiar with how Christians believe their  destiny will be fulfilled!<br />    The author of &quot;The Great Year&quot;  argues that history is not predetermined, that human behavior and events  are not so predictable, and that historians often bias their accounts using  various filters, especially the theory that history and humanity are always   progressing.<br />    Very broadly speaking, what the author seeks to  accomplish in this very large survey are three things:     1) To define  &quot;The Great Year&quot; concept and pinpoint how and when it manifested  itself in various cultures. Millenarian movements in Christianity and other  cultures are discussed thoroughly. Some readers may be surprised at how  widespread and pervasive milleniarism  has been over time in many cultures  and religions.     2) To show that historians who view history in terms of  progress are in error. Karl Popper wrote a book called &quot;ThePoverty of  Historicism&quot; that Campion and others have cited to show that  historical accounts are often biased by false preconceptions.     3) To  demonstrate that a number of currents in history, such as Marxism, are  actually millenarian movements themselves, describing history in their own  terms of fulfillment of their predetermined  goals.<br />    I feel that the  author suceeds very well with these aims. I was particularly impressed with  his insight in observing that adherents of  the more modern movements such  as Marxism and Nazism indeed act exactly like those who claim that a select  group of people will be &quot;saved&quot; because they believe in a  &quot;Saviour,&quot; that history is following their version of a  predetermined conclusion.<br />    In the end, however, I found parts of this  otherwise excellent book unsatisfactory because the author, while  accurately depicting the fallacies of other historical views, himself falls  into what I would call the trap of reason, that reason and material  &quot;proof&quot; are the sole arbiters of &quot;truth.&quot;<br />    In the  first part of the book Mr. Campion critisizes Jung for the latter's  writings which stated that excessive materialism had corrupted mankind and  made it more bellicose, hence 2 world wars in an era of great technological  progress. He claims that there is no &quot;proof.&quot; It's a shame that  Dr. Jung can't defend himself, as I'm certain he could. But let me say, if  the lack of spiritual values - compassion, tolerance, humility, a bond with  something Divine, etc., which have in no way kept up with our material  development in this century - is not one of the major causes of our almost  total preoccupation with materialism, then we might as well discard the  timeless teachings of many teachers, theologians, and others, who have   attempted to bring some civility and purpose into this often Godless,   corrupted world. Personally I am not willing to do this.<br />    I also found  the author's attack on &quot;New Age&quot; thinkers, like Helen Blavatsky  and others, only too typical of the trite criticisms of materialistic  thinkers. I even checked out one of his sources, who wrote a trilogy  debunking Blavatsky and others (I can't remember the author's name), and  parts of the 2 books I perused were in my opinion  sadly failed attempts to  attack the messangers while not attempting to  take on the far more  difficult and important task of evaluating their messages. Not at all  surprising, for how can we &quot;prove&quot; that there is a God, or that  there are Masters of Wisdom, karma, reincarnation, etc., which would point  to some spiritual meaning for life? There are  those who try to prove these  things, even doctors, scientists, etc., but  from what I could tell from  this book, to Mr. Campion and his sources it's  doubtful that any proof  would ever suffice. To me a purely materialistic  reading of history, where  there is no ultimate Purpose and meaning - which I would claim can be  pursued by trying to grow spiritually, often through multiple physical  incarnations - is itself in one important sense  lacking in purpose.	1999-06-16

She probably has a  near-death experience, though this is not claimed  in the book. When she  regains consciousness, it is as if her  current personality has been merged  wih the personality  (purportedly) of a previous incarnation she had as a  temple virgin  in Abydos, Egypt. Bentreshyt, her name in that incarnation,  had a short-lived affair with Sety the First (father of the famous Ramses  II), and became pregnant at the tender age of fourteen. Forced  into a  confession by the temple priests, Bentreshyt then committed suicide.<br />     Dorothy, just as the central character in &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot;  becomes fixated in finding her true self, and thus spends the rest  of her  life obsessed with ancient Egypt. She eventually lives in  Cairo for 20  years, working in the Antiquities Depaartment, and  then moves to Abydos,  where she lives for the rest of her life, working at the same Temple of  Sety where she had lived 3,000 years before.<br />    Now called Omm Sety,  which simply means &quot;Mother of Sety&quot; (she has a son during a  short-lived  marriage to an Egyptian),  Dorothy makes significant  contributions to Egyptology as an  expert draftsman, writer, and scholar,  as well as healing  and aiding the local villagers in her &quot;external  life.&quot; Yet her &quot;internal&quot; life is one that few if any people  could ever match! To put it very briefly, she has many meetings, both on  the  physical and astral planes, with her soulmate, Sety the First.<br />    I  will leave it to anyone who reads this review to get the book for the  incredible details. The writing and the telling of the story are excellent  from beginning to end. The epilogue is also a very stimulating, mostly  psychological discussion of such &quot;occult&quot; issues as  reincarnation, the nature of the astral body, astral projection, remote  viewing, even Shelldrake's morphogenic fields, and more!<br />    Get this  book from your library if it is out of stock, as was shown here when I  added this review.	1999-06-15

I am not an expert in any of the many disciplines that the theory of evolution covers, nor did  I read more than about 5 chapters of the book. But I was educated to believe that Darwinism is fact, and the  facts as I see them now is that Darwinism is far from fact, and has been  almost thoroughly discredited as a theory of everything, everything that it  purports to explain. For example, the fossil record shows stasis, not  mutation, in the overwhelming majority of cases. Even Stephen Gould has had  to admit this. <br />For more details, anyone not completely convinced that   the theory of evolution is the only truth about life's  mysteries, will  find many books. My favorite is &quot;Darwin  On Trial,&quot; by Professor  Phillip Johnson.<br />This is not to say that evolution doesn't occur, it does  w/o a doubt, but it simply does NOT explain the development  of all  organisms and their incredible complexities, not to my  satisfaction.<br />There is a certain omniscient tone in Mr. Dawkins's writing  that I find quite repugnant. He writes like he knows w/o a  doubt that  there is no Creator, a strange paradox indeed.  As other reviewers have  stated, he assumes evolution is a  fact and argues from that point. And who  can &quot;prove&quot; what is  right here? None of us saw any of these  (large-scale)  evolutionary changes happen, gradual or not, and as a number  of authors have stated, Darwinian evolution itself clearly requires  its  own kind of faith to be accepted. I feel that anyone with an  open mind  would admit that the notion of a Creator is just as  feasible as the  so-called mysterious hand of random mutation and natural selection. I feel  that a person would have to be an all-knowing being himself to be able to  state with 100%  certainty that there was/is no Creator.<br />Science in of  itself denies the notion of a supernatural Creator, science always looks  for a natural explanation. And just because scientists can explain  something, that doesn't mean it is necessarily proven, not at all.<br />The  dangerous corollary to Darwinian evolution as a theory that explains all of  life is that there is no meaning to life, no  &quot;spiritual&quot; meaning  anyway. For those who want &quot;proof&quot; that there  is spiritual  meaning, ask yourself deep in your heart, is there  some &quot;Higher&quot;  meaning to life? If you have already decided that  the heart is nothing  more than an organ which has no purpose other than to pump blood, or if you  can honestly say that you get no  answer, then I guess you can be content,  no, as certain as the  author of this book is, that all of life is just a  meaningless,  random assemblage of physical components that through  &quot;blind&quot;  chance somehow evolved by itself to complexity.  <br />Fortunately, I believe that if there is a Creator, It doesn't  really  care what we believe, It cares what kind of people we are  and what virtues  we embody.	1999-04-14
US	53062494	R1I1N7SVWP2ZU8	1560251964	991608091	Robin Williams	Books	4	24	24	N	N	Very good biography	I saw this book on the table at the local library and decided to read it, though I am not that big a fan of Mr. Williams.<br />I found this biography to be really top notch, highly readable, having just enough details without  being excessive. The book is an intimate portrayal yet is not intrusive.  While the author  acknowledges at the outset that his book is an  &quot;unauthorized&quot;  biography, you wouldn't know it - the quotes from  Williams,  his two wives, and close associates are very poignant, as if  given while being interviewed for this biography.<br />The author does a fine  job of tracing Williams life from childhood in Detroit through his  beginnings as a performer in San Francisco and at the Julliard School in  New York. There he becomes close friends with Christopher Reeve. The  friendship lasts through the years, and the chapter where Williams flies to  be with Reeve after the latter's tragic  1995 horse-riding accident,  cheering him up as he has cheered up many other fellow entertainers, is  very moving.<br />The book traces Williams career in TV and the movies (while  always mentioning Williams countless live comedy club performances) with  care and thoroughness. The chapters  on Mork and Mindy are interesting,  followed by Williams' lack  of box-office success in &quot;Popeye,&quot;  &quot;Moscow on the Hudson,&quot; and  the disastrous &quot;Club  Paradise.&quot; While having trouble making it in the movies, Williams also  has a lot of personal problems. Again, this part of Williams' life is  handled carefully, with detail, but without excess, and also has a happy  outcome when he bonds with his second wife, who later produces another of  Williams' huge successes, &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire.&quot;<br />Finally, in his 8th  film, Williams makes the big time with an outstanding performance in  &quot;Good Morning, America.&quot; He is nominated for academy awards in  this film, &quot;Dead Poets Society,&quot; and &quot;The Fisher King,&quot;  but doesnot win. I assume  that synchronistically while the author was  writing this  book,  Williams finally breaks through with an Oscar for Best   Supporting Actor in &quot;Good Will Hunting,&quot; which is described in  the book's epilogue. It seems like a fitting conclusion,  yet the author  also discusses Williams next 3 movies, as  he is a tireless  performer!<br />Highly recommended if you like Robin Williams work at all.	1999-02-09
