US	31869184	R1KKFDC0Q8F8AU	0380789019	511174865	Neverwhere	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Amazing and Beautiful..	Reading this was making me feel in touch once more with the fairy tales that I had read as a child. I loved that anything was possible and that there was magic to be found in the mundane. <br /> <br />The one thing that I had really liked was that Richard Mayhew was a complete everyman. It made it more believable to get inside his point of view and relate to his situation. The characters were highly realized and were definately real. Door, The Marquis and Hunter felt like friends as I was reading it. <br /> <br />Also, Neil's writing style is just fabulous. I love that his writing is fast past. I have sat there, reading it and got through fifty pages of it without realizing how much time has passed. It is absorbing and engulfing. <br /> <br />Overall, a great book, possibly a classic.	2005-01-16

It stirs your heart and you are wanting to know what happens next to the characters. Sarah Waters has created a fascinating world and a world that I loved inhabiting as I read this book. <br /> <br />Nancy Astley works in her family's oyster restaurant and goes to the weekends to the music halls. There, she meets Kitty Butler and they become fast friends. Kitty invites Nancy to be her dresser in London and it gets really fast past then. It goes from her being with Kitty, to having her heart broken by Kitty, then being a renter and living with the cruel Diana. To lastly, meeting a young socialist by the name of Florence. The characters, all of them, are intriguing. Nancy is a pillar of strength and Diana, though cruel, is definately interesting. Florence is the perfect girl for Nancy and Kitty. I have nothing but loathing for that character, because of what she did to Nancy. <br /> <br />The prose, reminded me of a cross between a modern novelist, Charles Dickens and Oscar Wilde. It was highly engaging and it makes one feel as if they are with Nancy and seeing what she sees. As far as the Erotic goes, it is, definately. But I think what really makes it good is the relationships and seeing things through Nancy's eyes. <br /> <br />This is a must read for anyone, gay, straight or bi.	2005-01-01

Upon reading Machiavelli's \\"The Prince,\\" I have came to realize that politics haven't changed much over the years. One can read the book and find that Bush's political career seems to be close to what Machiavelli had written. <br /> <br />Overall, it was quite an interesting read. I liked that it read sort of a manual to being a leader. But overall, I don't know if you could apply such tactics to real life. It is definately a classic and a must read in this day and age.	2004-12-28

This novel was one of the most witty and cynical that I have ever read. De Laclos has a gift for capturing the voices of his depraved characters. His voice was especially strong with the Marquise De Merteuil.  <br /> <br />The basic story-line was a pair of depraved aristocrats plot against a young innocent convent girl and a righteous woman and find that their plot has deadly consequences. It is like nothing I had never read before, since it was completely in letter format. I must admit that I normally use to the typical prose format that most novels are in. But reading the letters was wonderful and it made it feel intimate; as if you were really getting into the minds of the characters. Valmont and Merteil were both so vicious but strangely charming and your heart does go out to Tourvel and Danceny; the only figures in the book that truly do believe in love. <br /> <br />Overall, this book was such a pleasure to read and I highly recommend reading it with dark chocolates around.	2004-12-27

Chuck Palahniuk had out done himself when he sat down and wrote this novel. It was brave and bold, audacious beyond words and filled with so much truth. <br /> <br />The structure of the writing took a bit of getting used to. But that makes sense, it was told from a point of view of an insomniac and insomniacs are strewn in many different directions. <br /> <br />But I think that this book really does capture the psyche of the disenfranchised and the disenchanted. Which I think is most of the youth in society today.  <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, an impressive read fully deserving five stars.	2004-12-11

It to me was actually easier to read than Shakespeare and had a lot of depth to it. I loved the poetic cadence of words and the way that Sophicles had thrown you for a loop. The characters and plot, along with the chorus really would make for a good play and this would be absolutely lovely to see live. Very, very, good.	2004-12-08

I liked her personality, her resiliance, her strength and her determination. I have to disagree with a lot of reviews; I don't think she's cruel. I think it's more about she has a point to prove. I love her frankness and her audacity. She is definately an original character in literature. <br /> <br />The novel itself was very well written. I liked that it was stripped and clipped, without any fancy prose. It made it feel more from the heart. It was very realistic and it made me feel as if I was right there with Molly and experiencing what she experienced. I have to admit that it had a couple of scenes that were a little hard to believe, namly that scene about the man who loved to have grapefruit (or rubyfruit) thrown at him. It was a definate \\"What the h*ll\\" moment. <br /> <br />But overall, a must read.	2004-12-08

I have normally avoided fantasy novels with Celtic highland-esque looking covers and have characters with such names as Seamus and McFarland. It's nothing against the Celtic people but normally these novels are frankly boring knock-offs of Arthurian legend. I have to admit, \\"Mists of Avalon\\" is my favorite book, because it was such a pleasure to read. And \\"Daughter of the Forest\\" is another exception as well. <br /> <br />This was a retelling of the tale of \\"The Six Wild Swans.\\" What I liked that it was well-elaborated and detailed more throughly than the original tale. Here was intrigue and a test of character, that on the part of Sorcha of course. Marillier is very capable of capturing feeling very well. You do feel what the other characters feel and I loved the very much. The characters are mostly likeable, especially Conor and Finbar. And the language was wonderfully poetic as well. <br /> <br />With that said, I had a major problem with the relationship between Red and Sorcha. I did think that they suited each other very well. I understand that Marillier has a penchant for bringing unlike characters together in a relationship but it made no sense. She should have been with Simon. Another thing that I dislikedwas the romantic angle as well. Why is it that in fantasies, for the most part, the female character has to fall in love to feel completed? You would have thinked that having her brothers return to her would have been what she had truly wanted, since that was what she had worked for and been put through hell for. Lastly, a more technical thing is that I believe that the chapters should have been made a little more shorter or varied in their lengths. At times it felt like endurance reading but that is just me. <br /> <br />This was a pretty good novel, not my normal cup of tea but I am definately reading the next in the series.	2004-12-05

There was so much detail and description that I had to try and take it all in. Reading this is very similar to observing the weave that Barker describes so eloquently in the pages of this book. On my cover, it says \\"An Epic of the Imagination.\\"  And that, indeed, is. <br /> <br />The plot was intricate, matching the idea of a weave. It incorporated so many things that I love, mythology, religion and a complex plot. The language is evocative and poetic but also very stripped and common-place at the same time. The characters were very intriguing and realistic and each one was symbolic. <br /> <br />My favorite character out of the bunch was not a hero but rather a villain. I happened to adore the character of Immacolata. She was so cold and so vicious. She was a complete original and I happen to love it. <br /> <br />So overall, a rather engaging read and a masterpiece. It may even be one of my favorite novels but most definately, the best read I had all year.	2004-11-28

It has reaffirmed by beliefs about what is going on my country. But there is one thing that I absolutely doubt from Moore's perception. Is that we live in a liberal society. Seeing Bush get re-elected and Republicans taking hold of all three houses makes that belief somewhat unbelievable. But other than that; this book is destined to be a political classic and a must read for every American.	2004-11-06

Byatt's writing is sheer poetry and is so lush and beautiful. Byatt can really weave words together and create a tapestry of beauty. I love that these are modern fairy tales and deal with so many different topics.  <br /> <br />But beauty aside, the main problem of this anthology was that it did run hot and cold but not in a good way. Some stories I found boring and uninteresting. \\"Crocodile Tears\\" is a fine example of a story that couldn't capture my fancy. I was also confused by \\"Jael\\" and am still trying to figure out the meaning behind it. <br /> <br />But my favorite story was \\"Lamia In The Cevennes.\\" I loved the meaning behind this story and it made me smile.	2004-10-25

I think that this was confusing simply because I had not read any prior Sandman books, other than the one I previously reviewed. But that's what happens when you get books from the library. <br /> <br />But, after getting over the intial confusion, I found my bearings and this story was absolutely great. Once more, it's refreshing to see this kind of story-telling. Though it's in comic book form; it's recreating mythology for this era. I did find the art to be a little cartoony in this but it did not detract from the story. <br /> <br />Overall; I am definately am going to read the earlier volumes.	2004-10-18

I always thought that they were boring and unrealistic. The adventures of muscle bound freaks with ungodly amounts of testerstrone was the very last thing I wanted to read.<br /><br />But lo and behold, here was a comic series that had substance and a story beyond heroics. Neil Gaiman can really craft a story and the artwork was fascinatingly beautiful. The characters were great. I loved how Gaiman drew from mythology to tell his story.<br /><br />All I can say about this series, is give me the next volume.	2004-10-16

It was an honest and indepth look at life and death; using how people celebrated and look at death from all different centuries and customs. But also too, it celebrated friendship. The group of boys were willing to do what they could for their dying friend. So this book maybe a children's book but it deals with topics that all people of any age can relate to. <br /> <br />Also, I really want to commend the language used. It is poetic with a big wallop of nostalgia, which this being the second Bradbury book I've read, I think is hallmark. It really captured the innocence of Halloween night to a group of boys and also captured other things as well. <br /> <br />It's a wonderful little story, like the subject line said.	2004-09-26

What I love is that Bradbury shows you what it is like to be a writer and that is so helpful for someone just starting on that path. The language was highly poetic and also had a strong quality of nostaligia. Bradbury looks to his own memories and insights to color his advice.

I thought the movie was disturbing and at times somewhat boring. I know, what a strange contradiction. But I decided to read the novel. And I was spellbound. Michael Cunningham's prose is some of the most beautiful I have ever read. It is extremely simple but overwhelmingly moving and beautiful to behold. This novel reads like a painting. Something to observe.  <br /> <br />I found the women to be quite strong in their way. Each reflections of their own era and though their lives were simple; each one had an interesting and full life.  <br /> <br />But what I liked most that this was a book that makes you see life in a different way. That all hours of a day is something intense and should not be squandered.	2004-09-10

I loved this book when I first read it but reading it again this year dissapointed me. First off, I get tired of Francesca always using these magical fae girls in every single one of her novels. It gets tiring quite fast. I mean, I adore a sort of alternative vibe running around in her novels but the adoration of Tori Amos (who I do love by the way) and being into zines and things of like is not really realistic. In a lot of ways; her novels aren't really showing teenagers as they are. <br /> <br />But, I do enjoy how she writes as whole and that her works are always clever to a degree. But when I read it once more; I thought that this book wasn't as magical as I percieved. I seriously wanted to bash Claire with her faerie wand and push Violet from her Hummer while it was moving. The main characters grated me that badly. <br /> <br />Read Echo or Girl Goddess #9, way better books.	2004-08-05

It is about the underdog going up against a stronger force and almost beating it.  It inspires one to question society and make their own stand against the things that they detest. Hence why I loved this book. It was written elegantly and beautifully.<br />The only thing that I didn't like was there was at times there was things that were not needed. <br />Otherwise; great novel.	2004-05-27

That things aren't for the greater good, that with courage and persiverance that we can achieve our goals. That; it is best to cultivate one's own garden.<br />One thing; this book is very, very French. It is very Moliere, Diderot, etc. styled.

I found that in some spots it was very tough to get through because it was slow but completely hang-in there, it gets better. <br />What makes Byatt's work beautiful is the language she uses. It's not typical 21st century writing, it goes back to the Victorian period feel that she tried to evoke and suceeds. Her main protagonists, Roland and Maud were very intriguing characters and the side characters were fascinating as well.<br />I also loved the themes that she uses, male versus female, etc. It was a hard read but I want to go back to it; go through it and I love books like that.	2004-05-18

I am beginning to seriously wonder if De Lint is pagan or not. It was a wonderful way to celebrate Lammas Eve	2003-08-02
US	31869184	R1ALCLU0NAN1EW	0786866462	711918396	A Density of Souls	Books	4	0	0	N	N	I loved it.	I had read this primarily because it was Anne Rice's son who wrote it and when I was done, I loved it and Chris is a very talented author. Unlike his mother who takes a sensual road, Chris is more simple and a lot more relaxed, which I enjoyed. He made protagonists that I could relate to and a nice flow that made the book a good read. Christopher is his own writer and I can't wait to read what he did next.	2003-07-31

I had stayed up to six am reading this book and may I say that it was worth it. I love J.K. Rowling's writing style, it is easy to read and there is an ability to glide through it. I loved the cast of characters and I have gained a lot of respect for both Snape and Longbottom. I loved this novel to bits and pieces and it was the best in the series so far	2003-07-26

It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought.	2003-07-23
US	31869184	RP2BP67YEIV56	1550224433	788426671	Dave Matthews Band: Step into the Light	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Well written and researched.	I am huge DMB fan and I have to say that this is the most consise and well researched pieces that I have ever read. After hearing what trials and tribulations that the  band had faced, it has spawned an even deeper appreciation for this band and for their music. It makes me want to either have been in Centerville during the times when DMB played their as a unsigned band or a taper running cross country to their shows. This book was absolutely amazing.	2003-07-16
US	31869184	R38PKY86LZOOHU	0789457881	394774524	Ancient Rome (Eyewitness Books)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Great Introduction to the world of Ancient Rome	Being a bit of a fan of the Roman Empire, I had taken a look at this book and may I say that it was very good, for a beginners book. The photography was amazing and it was chock full of info for those who had not encountered Roman history before.<br />Really reccomended.	2003-07-14

I was amazed by the plot and the descriptions. I also loved the twists and turns featured in this book, which made it a pleasure to read. I have to say this is one of the most inventive children's novels that I have ever read.	2003-07-11

I really loved the stories Travels with the Snow Queen and Quiting Loup. I also loved Twa Corbies. But some were a little bit to be desired. I really thought that the whole feminist fairy tale theme was a little bit hard to swallow and a tad annoying but overall a good read.	2003-07-07

Like my title said, I avoided these books as if I was avoiding the plague but after a recommendation from a friend at the time, I was hooked from page one and read it in one sitting. The descriptions were amazing and Fitch had created one of my favorite fiction characters of all time when she created Astrid's mother, Ingrid. I loved how she was this ice queen and how she cared nothing but what she thought. I know she is a b**** but she still made me want to turn the page. I also felt quite a deal for Astrid and her struggle was deep and intense. This book is just beautiful	2003-06-25
US	31869184	R2E9QCD3XUCK0T	0452282950	609426348	The 25th Hour	Books	5	4	6	N	N	One of my all time favorite books	I had wanted to read this since I had saw the previews of the movie of the same name. I was blown away by Benioff's style and how he brings you inside the hearts and the minds of the characters. My favorite character had to be the frustrated English teacher, he was so realistic. Monty was the ultimate bad guy that we want to root for. This was a powerful novel and another must read for everyone.	2003-06-25
US	31869184	R21AXENNI7V84Z	0060281278	969831101	Echo	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Dreamy and Haunting	I was so amazed by Echo, the Francesca Lia Block book that I had read of recent. Block has a gift for imagery and poetic language, which makes Echo a more impressive read. I was a little lost by the change of characterization but it did not detract from the novel. I also loved the fact that it was told in short story form, making this Block's most ambitious novel to date. I am really enraptured by this book and recommend it to all.	2003-06-25
US	31869184	R14J1GFUJEKDI	0451458311	595416745	Out of Avalon: An Anthology of Old Magic & New Myths	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Interesting but lacks the true magick of Avalon	Out of Avalon was good but it gave the taste of something that could have been better. The tales that are featured in this book were interesting but some were down right boring. I had fallen asleep on The Castellan and thought Me and Gallahad could have been written by a fanfiction amateur. I was impressed however with the stories Avalonia and Finding the Grail, especially loved the line that stated men go out for treasures both rare and magickal but women are the ones that find it. Overall it is a reccomended read but still could have been done better.	2003-06-21
US	31869184	R2HQH7WMHD3JVP	0786808012	442293804	Artemis Fowl	Books	3	7	13	N	N	Impressed but not impressed	I was impressed by Colfer's knowledge of faeries. Normally when writers write about faeries they automatically assume that they are dealing with Tinkerbells and not the complex creatures that they are. I also like Colfer's writing style, it was very relazed but at the same time sophisticated. What I didn't like was the characters, they weren't portrayed with a lot of feeling or depth. Artemis was a boring brat, his servants mindless and the faeries themselves seemed like rejects from the Dirty Dozen. I was impressed by something but somethings I weren't I am just so jaded from reading so many books and being hard to impress. Also the Harry Potter comparisons don't fit since they are entirely different stories. So that is my two cents.	2003-06-06

I was kind of dissapointed with this biography, since I had wanted to read more about her life instead of the books which I have already read. I liked the interviews from O magazine, Newsweek and Larry King but felt that we didn't need to read the things about the books, since if they are looking for info about J.K. they probably already read the books. So it was okay, not the best.	2003-06-01
US	31869184	R3JT8AX2HYW72T	0060280921	703135449	Abarat	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good but not his best	As a longtime fan of Clive Barker, I was chomping at the bit to read this novel. I have to admit that though it was good, it was not his best. I loved the artwork and thought his characters were very well thoughtout but at the same time, the novel felt like it was a revisit to Gulliver's Travels and other such mythic quest novels. I liked it and felt it deserved four stars and will read more from the others in the series but still, if you want Clive at his best, try Cabal, Books of Blood, and Coldheart Canyon.	2003-05-28

I think someone didn't do their homework	I liked this breif bio but I found a lot of inaccuraces. I was little disgusted by the fact that the author did not do their homework before setting out to write it. Otherwise a nice breezy read.	2003-05-18
