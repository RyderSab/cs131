It is a compilation of mostly lectures and notes from Kalu Rinpoche's teachings. Many times during the first read-through, I honestly felt as though this master was in the room, speaking the words on the page directly to me - evidence of the truthfulness in his words. The format of the book is such that each chapter builds upon the last, going from some very fundamental teachings (examining our situation) through the refuge vow, and all the way up to the esoteric mahamudra teachings.  There is also a chapter on the challenges of dharma practice. Appended is an actual visualization practice, (&quot;sadhana&quot; in sanskrit) of the tantric deity of compassion, along with instructions. Among my own books, this is one I keep on the &quot;reference&quot; shelf.	2001-01-26

Unfortunately for us, he died recently, but thanks to the efforts of Lama Surya Das, et al, we can catch more than just a glimpse of this man's wisdom and power. Written from the perspective of teacher-teaching-student, it does have an amount of &quot;dzogchen lingo,&quot; but any serious seeker would do well to learn some of these terms and fathom the realities they reference. It is said his teaching style was always one of very direct and personal exchange regarding matters of actual practice, and I think it is this more than anything else which comes through in this book. Very inspiring to the student of dzogchen, &quot;the great perfection.&quot;	2001-01-26

In a few languages!  The book is less about buddhist &quot;philosophy&quot; as a whole, as much as about epistimology, the shared view of which any two buddhist debators would need as a starting point.  The various trends that developed to &quot;cope&quot; with Dharmakirti's somewhat slippery model is what forms much of the book.  The western idea of &quot;universal&quot; is the equivalent to the concept Dreyfus puts under the microscope for us.  I found this book both challenging and rewarding, though it did take me quite a while to read~!	2001-01-26

The author of the &quot;root text,&quot; Ngari Panchen (1487 - 1542), was a famous scholar, and his text is used widely to teach both the vows themselves and how to maintain them.   The lengthy commentary, by Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, Dudjom Rinpoche, adds much to the very concise style of the main text.  Dudjom Rinpoche's qualifications for this are beyond challenge.   If you are interested in the nature of the three vows, and how to maintain and restore them within Nyingma, there is no other book.   However, as far as Tibetan Buddhism as a whole is concered, there is another book on the same subject, but from a master of the Kagyud school, translated as &quot;Buddhist Ethics,&quot; which is equally profound and informative.   The translations of both of these books are top-notch.   Both teams referred and deferred to lama-consultants within the lineage.   This sort of book is especially important these days, when so many people are diving into traditional practice without perhaps all of the traditional education (for lack of resources or whatever.)   Even for this reason alone, I highly recommend carefully perusing both of these texts.	2001-01-21

However, those who do have some experience in Tantric Buddhism, especially Dzogchen, will likely benefit from studying this. As Chagdud Tulku explains at the start of the book, this text should be regarded as a holy object of veneration, and even to keep this on one's altar until transmission is received will bring blessings. The text is a compilation of visionary experiences had by Dudjom Lingpa, a famous lama-yogi of the 19th century.  His next reincarnation, Jigdral Yeshe Dorje (Dudjom Rinpoche) edited them into the present format, and created a helpful outline of topics, appended to the translation.	2001-01-21

He has some extraordinary, unique perspectives, apparently born from many years of study, in both Tibetan as well as European philosophies. But a translator? It seems he  fancies himself more a sort of &quot;decoder,&quot; if you will, and his  (sometimes lengthy) reasonings behind his peculiar, intense word choices  often appear sound. Yet as the years go on, and students of this genre grow  in there understanding of key terms, key-term translation is becoming  more-and-more standardized, leaving his &quot;translations&quot;  less-and-less accessible.<br />If you work at it, you can squeeze out many of  the original Tibetan terms from his indexes, footnotes, etc., and thereby  triangulate with the more commonly-used terms. -Somewhat tiresome if what  you really want is a more direct translation, for use in a student-teacher  situation for example. Furthermore, this book and the other two in the  trilogy are much more commentary than translation. This is a shame, since  Longchenpa himself wrote an auto-commentary to them.<br />That said, Guenther  IS a great thinker, and if you would like to read Guenther, as opposed (in  this case) to Longchenpa, then I'll say, this and all of the books I've  read by him (some dozen) are truly fascinating. Very original and  thought-provoking.<br />Maybe look for a translation elsewhere. -no offense,  Herb.	2000-06-07

The first attempt to write this review had to be aborted due to lack of space! I love this book. I love Tulku Thondup. I love Longchenpa, in large part due to the efforts of Tulku Thondup himself. This book, previously  published as &quot;Buddha Mind,&quot; has so much good stuff in it, i can't  tell it all! Start with a thorough outline of the views within the nyingma  school, culminating in dzogchen, throw in some stories from past masters'  lives, and you have the first part of the book. The second part is a  careful selection from some of Longchenpa's important writings. This  includes a section each for the &quot;view, meditation and result&quot; of  dzogchen. Within the &quot;meditation&quot; section is the full translation  of both an instructional text and its practice explanation. This alone is  worth a lot of gold, if you know what i mean.
