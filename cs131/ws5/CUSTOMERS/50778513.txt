It's well worth the effort to find it. <br /> <br />Muhammad Ali - The Unseen Archives is predominantly centered on Ali's fights and trips to the United Kingdom. <br /> <br />It's 376 pages of fantastic and unique pictures of Muhammad Ali - about 95% of the pictures are of Ali in London and based around his European tours. <br /> <br />I found it completely refreshing and charming to see Ali in the unfamiliar surroundings of England. <br /> <br />My experience with these types of books are that you can usually blow off the small captions that explain what the picture is about - or where and why it was taken, but there's something special here that you want to read each caption and really experience the pictures. <br /> <br />The last 6 pages are an incredibly interesting and educational chronology of Muhammad Ali's professional fights and specific events that happened in his life - that shaped his life - and changed the world. <br /> <br />An absolute MUST have for every Ali fan! <br />	2004-11-23

It's a compilation of some of Sugar's works - 4 sections - sections 1 (Rants & Raves), 2 (The Fighters) & 3 (The Fights) are a collection of articles and section 4 is a brief history of sorts. <br /> <br />It's a really good read and I enjoyed it. <br /> <br />What I have to say next I feel somewhat sacrilegious saying but - I enjoy the Thomas Hauser books more (ex: A Year At The Fights and/or A Beautiful Sickness) and would recommend them before this - that is not to say skip this - you HAVE to read Bert Sugar - it's like saying you're a boxing fan, but unfamiliar with Rocky Marciano's fight record - but if you're a Hauser fan you'll also enjoy Bert Sugar. <br />	2004-11-12

His story is an interesting one and this book is well worth reading. <br /> <br />Rocky's career and life makes the most sense when looked at in the context of his time - not just the 1950's and the theme of the `50's - but his time in between 2 of the greatest - he came after Joe Louis and before Muhammad Ali - after the `40's and before the `60's - when you stop and think about it - it really is an amazing time - and an unfortunate time to be the world champ - just ask Larry Holmes. <br /> <br />All this I never fully appreciated or understood. <br /> <br />Rocky Marciano: The Rock of His Times is a great look at the life of Rocky Marciano - I learned a lot about the Rock and developed a greater admiration, respect and understanding of him as both a man and a fighter. <br /> <br />I did get the feeling though that something was held back - certain \\"warts\\" were touched on, but not fully explored - and I would have liked that. <br /> <br />Great for the boxing fan, historian and really anyone interested in learning about Rocky Marciano. <br />	2004-10-22

Rocky has had one of the hardest and troubled lives of anyone I've ever read about. It is a miracle that things turned out as they did. <br /> <br />The hell that was Rocky's childhood and life - this was like reading Dantes Inferno - well - if Dante was smacked around by his father, the cops and thugs and if Dante had a right hand made of concrete... <br /> <br />Astounding, fantastic, heart wrenching - I could not put this book down. I could not believe the hardships and hell that Graziano had to endure and he came out the other side an incredible man. <br /> <br />You can feel the honesty and sincerity on every page. It's a great visit to a time, language, custom and society that seems so foreign to today, but yet similar too.  <br /> <br />Great for the biography fan, the boxing fan and history fan. <br /> <br />It's a great book - find it - buy it - read it ya bum! <br />	2004-10-12

I wanted to love Sugar Ray - he was Ali's hero and in a lot of circles he is considered pound for pound the greatest boxer of all time! <br /> <br />I wanted to love this book and Sugar Ray - but unfortunately I didn't. <br /> <br />I almost feel like I'm committing some sort of sacrilege here - and I'm sad to say - I found Sugar Ray Robinson somewhat unlikable. <br /> <br />The story is a great story - a very poor family's struggle and their support and love for each other - Sugar Ray's discovery of boxing and his rise to fame and fortune and the phenomenal and heart breaking comeback and the sad decline in the end. His story really is very interesting, but the book doesn't capture it. It doesn't capture the Sugar Ray magic and I felt that Sugar Ray wasn't 100% honest - he and the book were truthful, but I felt that there was something missing - that he wasn't completely honest. <br />	2004-09-28

I could not put this book down. It reads like a bull charges. A little bit of wind up - I'd say the first 19 pages - then it's a charging bull.    Jake's story is much more than what the movie shows and is different.     As we all know and heard so many times - the book is always better than the movie and again it's very true here - the book is Jake's exact story not changed one hair for Hollywood. It's such an intense, real and gritty story.     It starts off in Jake's childhood as a tuff Bronx kid taking a beating from his father and the world - and as he got older the beatings continue and get worse - the biggest beatings coming from himself.    La Motta is brutally honest and doesn't try to hide anything or paint himself in a special light. It's a powerful and straightforward look at his life, his heart and a candid look at the sport of boxing back then.    It's a great book, you'll pound through the pages like a raging bull.	2004-09-19

That didn't happen - he knocked Ali flat on his back. Another example - Garber refers to Emanuel Steward as Manuel Steward - the wrong name. <br /> <br />Other than that the book is enjoyable - it gives you a quick look and synopsis of some of boxing's greatest legends. <br /> <br />I liked the choice of boxers Garber chose to discuss - in particular Teofilio Stevenson - the Cuban Olympic Heavywieght - his story is very interesting and I felt that it was truly a brave and bold choice to include him in this book - which is why this book gets 4 stars as opposed to 3 - and simply put I was very impressed to find such a gutsy choice in this book. <br /> <br />The book keeps pretty much on the surface of each chosen topic and is a good book for the pre-teen to teen interested in boxing or anyone interested in the history of boxing. <br /> <br />I'm glad I own it. <br />	2004-09-02

I've read my fair share about Ali's life and each time Bingham is brought up there are only nice words used to describe him. I don't think I've ever read an unkind word about him... <br /> <br />This book is a collection of black and white pictures that Bingham has taken over (at the time it was published) their 30 years together. Some will be familiar to you, some new and all of them extraordinary. <br /> <br />This is a hard book to find, you'll either need to buy it used off Amazon or check eBay or the like, but get it.  <br /> <br />One of those photo books that make you want more <br />	2004-08-23

This was the time when Ken Norton was a riddle that Ali couldn't figure out...and when Big George Foreman was simply concurring the world - destroying myths, legends and knocking everything down. <br /> <br />George Plimpton captures that feeling - it's not thrown in your face, but you can feel it. <br /> <br />The boxers and fights are slightly on the peripheral of the story he's sharing. It's mostly about him and his experiences with boxers, boxing and other writers, but it is about boxing and in the time when boxing was amazing. <br /> <br />It's a great book for the boxing fan and a great book for the literary fan. <br /> <br />Pound for pound one of the greats! <br />	2004-08-23

What Berger wants to do here is present the early part of Mike Tyson's career and other bouts that were peripheral as a season - for Tyson's \\"season\\" up through the Spinks fight - with an Epilogue and a Seven Years Later chapter (not as good as the rest of the book) - also included are the side story issues that were spilling over into Tyson's world - Robin Givens and her mother and Don King - <br /> <br />What's difficult is that because of when this book was written (it end after the Spinks bout) there is so much missing - but only because of the time line - obviously Berger couldn't predict the future - or write about what has not yet happened. <br /> <br />I truly hope that Berger writes another book - Blood Season's 2nd Season - or something that picks up from Spinks and goes to now... <br /> <br />Berger explains the Tyson tale through his perspective and through the eyes of a sports writer Sly - I thought it was interesting and informative and as a fan of Mike Tyson I enjoyed it. <br /> <br />I was worried at first about reading another book about Mike Tyson - I was worried about just rehashing the same things or of the all too easy Tyson bashing (thankfully there wasn't too much of that at all). <br /> <br />What makes this book different is the idea and effort of making these years of boxing into a season of sorts. It's a unique and interesting retelling of this familiar story. <br /> <br />I liked it and recommend it to anyone interested in Mike Tyson and anyone interested in the sport and business of boxing. <br />	2004-07-27

This is a great read and an attention-grabbing perspective on Tyson and those around him.<br />You get a deeper look at and much needed tour of D'Amato, Jacobs, Cayton, Rooney and the entire original Team Tyson line up - I can't help but wish that Mike stayed with them. These people really seemed to have his best interest in mind and truly loved him.<br />My one complaint is Heller's take on the rape trial - I felt he did a horrible job with the review of details and happenings - to say that Tyson's lawyer was of the same caliber of Clarence Darrow - PLEASE - the guy was Don Kings TAX attorney - he had no business defending Tyson - there were witnesses not allowed to testify, his strategy was ridiculous and there are other issues that I just wont include in this review...<br />I recommend this book and once I finished I wish there was more. I found it complete (for the time it covered), thorough and mostly accurate (except the trial/conviction) - it's one of those books where you feel part of the story.<br />Both the Tyson fan and non-fan can enjoy this book.	2004-07-12

The chapters go pretty much in chronological order of Tyson's life. From a touch on his childhood to the classic saga of Cus &amp; The Kid to post Holyfield II.<br />You get different perspectives of Tyson from those that see him in different ways. You get the good, the bad, the beautiful and the ugly.<br />I felt that a lot of what is covered in the book was pretty fair and balanced (to borrow a phrase). I really appreciated and got a lot out of the different views and different interpretations of Tyson from those who knew him in different avenues of his life.<br />I went into reading this with a sympathetic view of Mike and this view was reinforced and I was actually given more insight into the hardships that he has had to face as a kid and as an adult.<br />You would think that with his money and fame how could he have such a hard time, well this book does a good job in showing you how.<br />What stands out for me is the rape conviction. He had a horrible lawyer - Don King's tax attorney, certain witnesses weren't allowed to testify, certain evidence was not admitted and let's admit it - if he was a Kennedy (see William Kennedy Smith) he wouldn't have gone to jail.<br />There are some extremely interesting chapters in this that are genuinely eye opening into just how unfairly Mike Tyson has treated and taken advantage of.<br />Highly recommended to any boxing fan and especially recommended for anyone interested in the story of Tyson - fan or hater - you'll learn something.	2004-06-23

Older than I remembered, but still handsome and still a twinkle in his eye.<br />I don't know how Hauser always seems to do it, he always seems to make me forget about the world around me and just become part of his writing.<br />This is a great book - if you've read other Ali books or if his is your first - it's a great, easy book that simply shows you different perspectives on the GREATEST Of All Time - Muhammad Ali.<br />I laughed out loud a lot and got all teary eyed at times as well.<br />Great book - Great photos - Very hard to find - one of those you'll have to buy used on Amazon or find on eBay - do yourself a favor - find it and spend an afternoon with it.	2004-06-05

Mikkols) who said it best - \\"The Lady Knows Boxing\\" and she really does.<br />I was on the fence about reading this. I went back and forth trying to decide and finally just went for it and I'm glad I did.<br />Oates has a great and unique perspective on boxing as an art and science. She sounds like she's been around boxing her whole life and has a respect for it.<br />Her writing style is fancy, elegant and adds respectability to the sweet science.<br />I love her take on Mike Tyson - I hate that most writers make him sound like a monster. Oates knows he's human and shows him in a fair, understanding and empathetic light.<br />One sign of a great book is what it leaves you with or what it inspires you to do. I'm left with a greater respect and understanding of the sweet science of bruising and am inspired to read and learn more about Mike Tyson.	2004-06-04

I had thought that since it's Hauser's first attempt at writing about boxing that it would be just ok - maaaan was I wrong - THIS is a fantastic book!<br />Hauser is an amazing writer and is exceptional in all his writings about the sweet science.<br />This is a great example of a book successfully covering and achieving what it set out to do. You get educated on the inside story of professional boxing and get a great and personal insight into the world of Billy Costello.<br />I was caught up in every chapter and did not want to put this book down. I've never heard of Billy Costello before this book and found myself being nervous for him, being excited for him, cheering for him and feeling now like I was there with him.<br />Great book for anyone.	2004-05-27

He also briefly describes each fighter's career and life.<br />As he himself says any list of a specific number of greatest is bound to leave out some and at least stir up some controversy. This book comes pretty close though, but you'll need to decide.<br />At the end - he gives his top 10 list - THAT'S tricky business.<br />It's a great book to read from cover to cover or just skim to find out info on your favorites or a fighter you're not familiar with. Luckily each \\"chapter\\" is in alphabetical order and is listed as such on the contents - so it's easy to find a fighter.<br />The one thing that everyone can agree upon is that it's been one great century!	2004-05-16

Toshes writing style and way work perfectly here.<br />I think Sonny deserves more. <br />I would not consider this a biography of the champ, but I'm glad I read it. I'm glad I got to learn some parts of Sonny Liston that I didn't know before - so that alone is worth reading it - as long as you realize that Sonny is only a bit player in what is supposed to be his biography.<br />In addition to this I'd recommend David Remnick's King of The World - it's a fantastic book surrounded by Floyd Patterson, Sonny Liston and Muhammad Ali.<br />Read both and you get somewhat of a view of Sonny Liston.<br />Rest in Peace Champ!	2004-05-05

Put him in the ring and he's a tank with one purpose. That left hook. That left hook. That left hook.<br />I have mixed feelings about this book.<br />It's the autobiography of Joe Frazier - from his childhood to present day. The history of The Left Hook I found most interesting - it's not a chapter - it's information peppered throughout the book. That left hook!<br />I loved the details given about his fights. How he felt before and during the fights and what was going on in his life before, during and after these fights.<br />Joe had a really interesting and amazing career - Olympics, amateur and professional. He is an amazing competitor and athlete.<br />Here is what I had problems with - Ali - his treatment of Muhammad Ali - <br />I'm a HUGE Ali fan so take this with a grain of salt - <br />Joe is incredibly bitter and angry with Ali - rightly so too, but it taints the book and gives it a bitter mood. He flat out refuses to call Ali - Ali - and only refers to him as Clay or the Butterfly - or anything else but Muhammad Ali - it's completely understandable and makes sense. Ali really layed into him and was flat out cruel at times - but it distracts and takes away from the book. It takes away from a feeling of good sportsmanship. I would go back and forth with losing respect for Joe, but in the same breath I understand why he feels this way - but again this takes away from his story.<br />Ali / Frazier is forever intertwined with boxing history and boxing lore and it seems Joe resents Ali too much and that also takes away from certain aspects of the legacy and legend - but does add to other parts of it.<br />Compare and contrast how he speaks of George Foreman - there's a lot of respect, admiration and good feelings towards the big man.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in Joe Frazier and anyone interested in a legend of the ring, in one of the greatest fighters ever to lace `em up.	2004-04-14

The point in meditation practice where you start to wonder if you're doing this right - where - to put it simply - you just feel like an idiot - just sitting there - just breathing - and feelin' none the wiser -<br />The book is about the life of Soko Morinaga - and parts of his journey from novice to master.<br />The best parts of this book are the funny stories of this Master as he was coming up - as he was learning - these stories are funny and relatable.<br />It's a quick read, parts are funny, parts make you think and do that \\"nod\\" and most of the book makes you realize that you're not alone in feeling like an idiot sometimes - in life before, after and even during meditation.<br />This is a very good book - not great - but enjoyable and very good.	2004-04-05

It's truly inspired writing and a must read for any Ali fan and for anyone who has an idol or hero from any walk of life...it's just fantastic.<br />Part One is about Ali. Part Two is about Sugar Ray Leonard ( 2 articles) and Bruce Lee (1 article)- the Sugar Ray stories are good and the Lee story is interesting and sobering.<br />I didn't read Part Three as they are fictional stories.<br />My intent on getting this book was to read about Muhammad Ali - get more of Miller's perspective - as I've read a story of his before and wanted more of that.<br />The title and cover are a bit misleading in that it doesn't represent the whole book.<br />I really enjoyed the first 2 sections, but again - this wasn't what I was looking.	2004-03-24

He is incredibly knowledgeable and part of boxing, but never included himself or speaks of himself as part of the scene - as anything more than a writer -<br />I've enjoyed all the books I've read by him and I'm looking forward to reading more! - A Year At The Fights is another great example -<br />This is a great journey inside boxing. It's not a book recapturing and retelling all the fights of a year. It has some that, but this is a look inside boxing. The fights outside of boxers, outside of the ring and inside boxing as a sport and system.<br />The only thing I felt missing from this book was a scratch and sniff section to smell sweat and cigars.<br />It's a light read - an easy read and if you're a fan of boxing it's a book for you. All Hauser's boxing books are great. He has a great perspective on the boxers, the promoters, the business and everything in between...just ask his mother (inside joke after reading A Year At The Fights)	2004-03-12

I was lucky enough to buy mine used on Amazon - unfortunately for you - I ain't selling my copy.<br />I really loved this book.<br />I'm a student of Buddhism and am looking for clarity and instruction on meditation without a Guru - I liked that this book was recommended as such - as meditation instruction without a Guru - so if you're looking into meditation either through a Buddhist perspective or just looking into meditation without any \\"school of thought\\" this is a fantastic book.<br />The biggest lesson I got from the book was keeping meditation as a hobby. I could see that my meditation was getting close to me \\"punching in\\" before I sat and The Wooden Bowl simply reminds you the joy of keeping meditation as a hobby rather than as a job - or a rigid activity.<br />I can't express in words the simplicity and warmth that this book provides. There is very little instruction - but the instruction given is perfect.<br />Clark Strand (the author) puts it perfectly - his thoughts are on instructing meditation is like giving driving directions - the easier and simpler - the better.<br />Think for a minute - telling someone how to drive from your house to the mall. <br />Throughout this book you also get reminded what the present moment is - the present moment is always right here and right now - <br />I really enjoyed this book - it's simple and for everyday life.	2004-03-02

You know how in some books an explanation of a technique is given and the photo along with the explanation just doesn't make any sense whatsoever - well - this book should be used as a model for future books as the photos along with the explanations are among the best I've seen.<br />The book is broken up into 9 chapters - from equipment to sparring.<br />Boxing Equipment<BR>Wrapping Your Hands (among the best I've seen)<BR>Stance<BR>Punches<BR>Movement<BR>Combinations<BR>Defence<BR>Ring Strategy and Boxing Style<BR>Training<br />Chapter 8 is my favorite - Ring Strategy and Boxing Style.

They are pretty similar to the Dummies and Idiots books, but without that initial giggling of having the words ...for Dummies - and Idiot in the titles.<br />This is a great introduction to what Zen is and it has some of the best, useful and practical tips and advice on to how to practice that I've ever read.<br />The big focus in this book is the practice of Zen. That's not to say that all the book talks about is meditation. The Everything Zen Book pretty much covers as close to everything Zen as one book can.<br />I was most impressed with how The Everything Zen Book wonderfully emphasizes throughout that Zen is the Practice. No smoke and mirrors of what Zen is - just the real - as Jacky Sach's and Jessica Faust simply put:<br />Zen starts with seated meditation, then you take what you learn on the cushion and apply it to the rest of your life...<br />The negative - someone chose to have a horribly difficult to read font for the quotes that are peppered throughout the book - it ruined the initial experience of each of these fantastic quotes making them almost impossible to read. Not a deal breaker - I still highly recommend the book to those interested in Zen and those that want to further learn about hitting the cushion and start meditating...	2004-02-08

It takes a while to figure out how to wrap.

Again - this is a beginners guide and is really for the beginner - NOT exclusively as I got some good detail regarding throwing a hook punch.<br />Also the pace of the book builds as your skill builds - the order of chapters and tools taught are exactly where they should be.<br />Chapter 11 is a brief history of boxing which I enjoyed.<br />Chapter 12 consists of the author's journal entries(a newcomer to boxing)- they are his first 6 months of lesson's with Alan Lachica - who sounds like one very cool guy and one of the best coaches out there for those interested in practicing the Sweet Science.<br />Great book for the beginner	2004-02-04

So for the beginner it is great. There are lots of areas covered and lots of issues, practices, schools of thought and miscellaneous things addressed. Like the book itself says - Learn the ancient traditions and apply them to modern life.<br />For the more advanced practitioner/student this is a wonderful review and different perspective on some of the fundamentals of Buddhism. <br />I'm a huge fan of introduction type of books to Buddhism - each author has their own perspective on certain things. So you never really read the same thing twice in any of these books. <br />I did think there would be a little more information on some of the traditions. I would have liked more in-depth explanations on how some events are dealt with - specifically births and funerals. Regarding death and funerals I know how Christians and Jews formally handle them - with a wake or sitting Shiva, but I wanted to know how Buddhist do it too.<br />This really is a fantastic book, fun and easy to read. I highly recommend it. Also I recommend Buddhism For Dummies either before or after this one - either way you'll get a great vision and introduction to Buddhism.	2004-02-02

This book has classic stories and classical examples of old Tibetan Lamas and has current stories and examples of the author in now times in New York City.<br />The famous phrase that really sums up the experience of reading with the author - Lama Surya Das - is the Deli Lama - again Awakening The Buddha Within is full of great Tibetan wisdom of old and it's related to today.<br />The emphasis in Awakening The Buddha Within is the eight-fold path. This is one of the best journeys down the eight-fold path I've taken.<br />Each aspect of the path is explained in detail, spirit and examples. It really is one of the best explanations of the eight-fold path I've read and experienced.<br />If you're a student of Buddhism and want to explore the eight-fold path this is definitely the book for you.<br />If you're new to Buddhism to this is a fantastic 2nd step to being introduced to the Buddha within.	2004-01-26

It's the easiest to read as well as being very simple and at the same time deep in it's content.<br />It's divided into 4 short wonderful sections: <br />Contentment, Joy and Living Well<BR>Facing Death and Dying<BR>Dealing With Anger and Emotion<BR>Giving and Receiving<br />It's one of those books that you can keep by your night table or in your meditation area or wherever and take a look at it every so often.<br />The cover is so warm, inviting and peaceful that I might just have to get another copy, cut the cover out and frame it.	2004-01-13

I would have to say that Zen Flesh, Zen Bones itself is a koan - how else could you explain fitting so much into such a tiny book?<br />I fully enjoyed reading and experiencing this book. Even how the book got it's name is a great tale.<br />The book is divided into 4 parts. <br />The first section is 101 Zen Stories. They are all incredible, illuminating and fun. I love Zen stories and after the 101st one I wanted more.<br />The second section - the Gateless Gate - some more types of Zen stories followed by comments from Mumon. Mumon must mean Very Cranky in Japanese.<br />The third section - 10 Bulls - is such a great illustrated story and then finally the fourth section is on Centering - <br />This was such a joy to read and was easy to understand and really lots of fun!	2004-01-12

I left this book with a different view on meditation as the practice - as the actual doing of the practice.<br />I liked that there's no smoke and mirrors that you tend to get with Zen content. This is very straightforward and exceptionally helpful for those who are doing or thinking of doing the practice - meditation.	2004-01-10

I know when I read reviews I like to fully know what the book is about etc and to be honest I cannot fully explain it, but I really enjoyed this.<br />I was unfamiliar with Shin Buddhism and actually after reading this book I want to know more.<br />I at first thought that Amida Buddha was a Christ type figure and that this sect of Buddhist worship him in that same way that Christians worship Christ.<br />Taitetsu Unno is a great story teller. I love the way this book is written. He compares aspects of Shin Buddhism with like or comparable aspects of other religions to help you understand. This is done in a non-competitive way and non-judgmental way that is so refreshing and helpful that you really get a good understanding of the concepts, ideas and feel of Shin.<br />Taitetsu Unno shares with the reader his own experiences, thoughts and feelings and I felt welcome on each page. The personal stories, examples and tales really helped me to understand with my head and heart - and it left me wanting to know more and wanting to share and be part of the namu-amida-butsu.	2004-01-06

In every Amazon search I did on Introduction To Buddhism books - Buddhism Plain and Simple popped up. In some reviews of other books on intro to Buddhism this one gets mentioned - so I had to give it a read.<br />I very much enjoyed Steve Hagen's style of explaining concepts. Particularly he gives us a chance to experience true \\"seeing\\" in his chapter \\"A Wheel Out of Kilter\\". I wont give it away here, but it's a terrific and original tool and it truly helped me to \\"see\\" more clearly.<br />If you're looking for a little more than just an introduction to Buddhism give this a read. It really is a great lesson in being aware, right now...every day.<br />Enjoy.	2003-12-30

His Holiness The Dalai Lama smiling at you with mouth and eyes. Every time I look at it I smile. I'm tempted to cut the cover off and frame it...<br />The book discusses in great detail the 4 Noble Truths. <br />It's difficult to write a review on books regarding Buddhism. Everyone's experience will be different and everyone's understanding will be different and I don't want to discourage anyone from exploring The Path... <br />For myself I found this book difficult to follow. Someone else may take to it better and find it an easier to understand (I ain't the sharpest knife in the drawer)<br />I felt like a freshmen walking in late to a lecture and the audience and class this was for was all graduate students. I felt like I missed the beginning of the talk and that the level of content was for more advanced students. <br />I do not recommend this to a newcomer to Buddhism, again I found the \\"level\\" to be more advanced, but that's your call and like I said you may take to it better than I did and hey - it's your path.<br />I did get things out of the book and did learn some things. I felt incredibly honored to be reading the words of HH The Dalai Lama and that's what kept me reading.<br />The photographs are absolutely beautiful! - and again - I love the cover!	2003-12-23

It's easy to read, entertaining and engaging. It also presents itself as a great follow through or next step as to living Zen.<br />Depending on what you're looking for regarding Zen. This book gives you an overview of Buddhism with a quick 5 cent tour and with wit, humor and a sense of familiarity introduces you to Zen, Zen terms, Zen thought and a Zen perspective regarding life, home, work and family.<br />Another reviewer had mentioned that so many other books on Zen don't really \\"explain\\" Zen in the Western sense of the word. I've notice that too - it's like you're not in on the inside joke - or something like that. This book explains Zen and explains it well without the sense of you not being in on the joke. It's not just a collection of koans or an illustration of Zen through stories. Don't misunderstand me; I'm not saying that those stories or illustrations through tales are bad. For me I find them difficult as an introduction and after reading this book I actually want to continue my Zen path through those very tales and stories.<br />I got a lot out of this book and enjoyed reading it. It's a great introduction to Zen and more.	2003-12-22

Trinity's review for some reason caught my attention and kept popping into my head as I read the book. Really just one theme - \\"Buddhism For A Generation Weaned On Mr. Rogers\\" specifically Trinity's view of the language.<br />There were times where the language was too flowery. I know I'm reading about and am in the space of Buddhism and that this type of criticism goes against my preconceived notions of Buddhism, but it just bugged me here or there and I got distracted.<br />My Wondering Monkey Brain aside I thought this book was a good next step. A good exploration into Buddhism that goes beyond the introductory level. That's what I was looking for - a next step onto the eightfold path or Buddhism 102.<br />There are some very good things in this book. Very good detail into other avenues of Buddhism that I was not aware of. See the table of content. Part 1 and 2 I found excellent and familiar. Parts 3 and 4 were new and hard to follow, but all in all contained very good detail and specific areas and information.<br />Again - this is a good 2nd step. If you're looking for a little more than you're used to or a little more in-depth view into Buddhism this is a good book.<br />Good - not great. I'm still torn between giving a 3 or 4 star rating. Reluctantly I'm giving it a 3.<br />Thich Nhat Hanh sounds like a fantastic man and you could feel his goodness and love coming through each chapter.	2003-12-05

This part of the concept fell a tad short - not exactly what I wanted or expected.<br />I loved the way the chapters are divided and selected - you get to hear the story of 15 fighters that got to square off in the ring with Muhammad Ali.<br />As a Muhammad Ali fan and after reading so many books about him, I missed him - I missed Ali - He's in the book, but through the eyes of his opponents - these are their stories about their lives, careers (both before and after Ali) and of course their experience with the Great One and how he affected their lives.<br />It's a great look and unique perspective at what and who was in the other corner - 15 stories from 15 fighters<br />I was especially interested in Joe Fraziers comments - I understand why he hates Ali, but it just makes you sad to read it in print. I also really enjoyed the chapters of George Forman and Ken Norton, and - actually I really enjoyed the others too.<br />Simply put - it really is a cool book about some very interesting fighters and their moment(s) with Muhammad Ali - and after<br />A MUST have for Ali fans.	2003-10-08

What we have are a bunch of Thomas Hauser articles with very clever and interesting introductions to each article.<br />I did not want to put it down - it was fun, exciting entertaining, informative and fun - yes, I said fun twice.<br />Hauser is such a modest and humble guy - he knows Muhammad Ali, he has interviewed and hung out with many a boxer and has been involved in and with boxing history - yet he remains incredibly humble and in the background - the book ain't about him, but he's a part of it - VERY well done.<br />Most importantly - he makes mention of Butterbean not once, but twice! - AND quotes him!<br />This is a great, fun, exciting, entertaining, informative and fun book - you won't want to stop reading - each article is like a Pringles potato chip - you can't just stop with one.	2003-09-24

I'm a slow reader and it was simply time consuming to finish each chapter.<br />The chapters are told to you by Ali's friends, family, contemporaries and the man himself.<br />You really get a feeling for Muhammad - the person not just the boxer - through his family, friends and those that know him. I put the book down feeling closer to Muhammad Ali and feeling a warmth from him and a warmth towards those he loves and cares for...<br />I walked away from this book with such great feelings for Muhammad Ali.

It's a small book - around 160 pages and is a great fit for my Muhammad Ali collection...anyones Muhammad Ali collection.<br />The introduction reminded me how the act of a bicycle thief set in motion the creation of one the Greatest boxers in history - gave Ali a platform to show his Greatness in and out of the ring - the introduction made me even less angry about my own red bike being stolen when I was 12 - the introduction made sit back, scratch my head and say a BIG thanks to the Bike Thief	2003-08-07
