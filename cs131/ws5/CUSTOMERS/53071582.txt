Over and over, Johnson quotes Stephen Jay Gould's criticisms of traditional evolution as if they were criticisms of evolution itself. In fact, Gould is simply trying to argue for punctuated equilibrium rather than evolution at a constant rate.<br />This book is shallow: Johnson has apparently only read the popular-science literature. Virtually all of the book is written as if Gould's and Dawkins' popular books constituted the entire literature on evolution.<br />Once again we hear the tired creationist argument that evolution only occurs within species, when the fossil record shows clearly that new species arise from old ones, e.g. horses and rhinos arose from a common ancestor. One wonders at the dismal picture of the history of life implied by this within-species view of evolution: God created dinosaurs, trilobites, and humans simultaneously, but later decided arbitrarily to extinguish the vast majory of species. It's all downhill. With no mechanism for replacing extinct species, one can only imagine that the world will end up with no life at all. The idea also doesn't work because there are no clearly definable species among obligately nonsexual organisms such as bacteria.<br />Finally, this book offers no real alternative to evolution. Instead, Johnson suggests allowing supernatural causes and faith-based reasoning into science. If supernatural science had anything to offer, then presumably it would have resulted in a consistent, useful body of scientific knowledge. It hasn't. There are as many types of creationism as there are creationists, and that's the way it will remain until they admit that empirical evidence is the only way to tell whose theory is right.	2000-10-29

Well, that's not terribly surprising since he's a protein chemist, not an evolutionary biologist. Basically he went and wrote a book outside his own field of expertise without doing his homework. He makes a big point out of how there have been absolutely no papers published about huge areas of biochemical evolution, but he's just wrong (see, e.g., responses at [...]<br />And even if one was ready to buy his argument that there was a problem with biochemical evolution, what he's proposing is to admit faith-based reasoning into science. What's going to happen next -- will scientific papers have to be peer-reviewed by witch doctors? Will we have to start considering whether astronomy research is consistent with astrology? Will geology papers be reviewed by flat-earthers?	2000-10-28

It's ironic that Asimov says in his intro  that his main reason for writing a sequel was to get the science right.  It's usually a pleasure to read his characters' long rambling dialogs about  science, but here it feels like a waste of time, since the science is all  made-up psuedo-science. The cold war setting actually feels more dated than  the original. I also had a hard time buying the protagonist's willingness  to throw in his lot with his kidnappers, and even to fall in love with one  of them.	2000-07-01

He's right on target with his criticisms of bad textbooks, rote memorization, and &quot;drill and  kill.&quot; However, he forces every issue into his predetermined framework  of &quot;us&quot; (people who agree with Kohn) and &quot;them&quot; (the  traditionalists). Many of the real issues that cry out for reform are not  being realistically addressed by either camp:<br />(1) The factory model. Both  Kohn and the traditionalists implicitly buy in to the factory model of  education, in which everybody has to move at the same pace because that's  the speed of the conveyer belt. The traditionalists try to speed up the  conveyer belt, but can only achieve that by turning learning into an  exercise in memorization. Kohn wants to slow down the conveyer belt,  condemning bright students to a day in school spent explaining things to  their slower peers. In my opinion, the solution is a return to  tracking.<br />(2) Quality of teachers. The traditionalists don't want to  address this because improving teacher quality would cost money, which is  anathema to their politically conservative values. Kohn hardly mentions it  either, which is amazing in a book of this length. In the sciencies,  there's a long history of failed reforms of the type Kohn describes,  precisely because so few K-12 teachers are qualified to teach  science.<br />(3) Textbooks. Traditionalists don't want to admit how bad  textbooks are. Kohn never wants to have a child read a chapter from a  textbook -- apparently even in high school?  As a boy in the California  public school system, I never even had _access_ to a textbook in any  subject outside the three R's. At least the traditionalists recognize that  schools need more books.<br />(4) The disorganization of the curriculum.  Although Kohn pooh-poohs the popularly accepted idea that fuzzy-headed  reformers took over education, there's more than a grain of truth in it. As  a boy, I never saw any hint of a system when it came to subjects outside  the three R's like science and history. Kohn is correct when he says  standards should be far less detailed, but there is indeed a need for  standards.	2000-06-03

Instead, it's more like a collection of idiosyncratic essays with a distinctly nationalistic point of view. If it was going to be a  useful reference work, one thing it would need is a good index, with  entries broken down better. (&quot;Reeds,&quot; for example., gives a list  of 20 page numbers without subheadings.) Loads of space is given to obscure  English saxophonists and composers. Many of the articles need fleshing out,  e.g. the part about mouthpieces doesn't say anything about the numerical  system used to describe them. It's also topheavy with advanced stuff,e.g. a  chart of altissimo fingerings and discussions of microtones, but no  ordinary fingering charts or trill fingerings. Classical players had better  not depend on this book as an introduction to jazz, since it doesn't  discuss any of the jazz issues about tonguing or triplet feel.	2000-06-01

Let me start by saying that I haven't read the book from cover to cover, nor have I taught out of it. Anyhow, I like the fact that it does away with all the baroque trappings of the typical physics textbook and focuses on  basic principles. The workbook provides support for active learning  methods, which is sorely lacking in books like Halliday. I'm just a little  worried that its dry, mathematical style would not go over well with  students. Also, I feel the approach is too relentlessly deductive --  students learn best by reasoning from the specific to the general, and it  is wrongheaded in my opinion to claim to derive the conservation laws from  Newton's laws.	2000-02-15

The characters are all defined by their nationalities and scientific specializations and not much else.

The characters are all one-dimensional, and we're inexplicably supposed to feel sympathetic to a character who is a professional assassin (and also kills people without pay whenever they  bother him). Gibson also overlays the assassin's actions with a patina of  Taoist pop-psych worthy of the worst Hollywood scripts; any self-respecting  Taoist ought to be insulted. The climax is insufferably lame -- as if a  fight and a disaster somehow brought resolution. I also can't stand  Gibson's style, which is like a mix of bad Hemingway and Discover magazine.  Why's he so allergic to the verb &quot;to be&quot;?	2000-01-13

The bad news is that although it has all the trappings of a classic puzzle mystery (including a locked room and a showdown at the end), the solution is so  unbelievable that if I had thought of it myself I would have immediately  discarded it.

The science in general is ludicrous, but it's particularly inexcusable when the physicists express  disappointment that they did not discover the Higgs boson in the first few  minutes of running a new accelerator. Virtually all the description of the  world of scienctific research rings false, especially the characters'  preoccupation with the Nobel prize.

I was fascinated by this book, and in many ways it presents a revolutionary picture of life in the solar system based on solid science, such as the recent discoveries that may show life on earth originated deep  under the surface, which implies that life could have originated without a  planetary surface that was juuuuuust right. But as a physicist I'm  disturbed by the way Davies cavalierly throws around the authority of  physics in a manner calculated to impress and mystify. I can't help  thinking that his fancy footwork with information theory is a matter of the  emperor's new clothes. Certainly my PhD in physics didn't help me to decode  some of this stuff, which is not a good sign for a book supposedly aimed at  a general audience. I can't understand his aversion to the idea that life  might have evolved independently on Mars or Europa, and I'm puzzled by his  refusal to believe in a materialistic basis for life. To his credit, he  does a fairly good job of pointing out which of his ideas are (to put it  charitably) speculative.	1999-05-15

You have to sort through long  lists of 9th-magnitude star clusters to find anything that would really be  visible. The second problem is that a large percentage of the objects  listed are pretty dim and crummy open clusters, and in most cases it is  extremely hard to tell whether you are seeing the cluster or not. The  photos are no help, because they are all long photographic exposures taken  through telescopes, nothing like what you actually see through binox.	1999-03-17
