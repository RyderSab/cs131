Reading it slowly made an impact on my life.  This book always served a special purpose in my life. It introduced me to the wide world of Literature. It sort of enlighten my interest and liking for English literature. Now re-reading it not only brought back fond memories of my yester school days but also renewed my liking to one of the greatest writer of all time Thomas Hardy.<br />Through this novel I came to the understanding of Irony and oxymoron. Hardy totally wrote with a sense of awareness of human characteristic and he had a amazing style of mixed humour with tragedy.<br />His protagonist,Michael Henchard's life was under the microscope of Hardy.<br />I love the way the story began I quote:&quot;ONE evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex, on foot. &quot; I love the Englishness and the sense of intriguing events that would follow...<br />In brief, Michael Henchard was a drunk who sold his wife and daughter at the fair. Later he realised his mistakes he work real hard and eventually became the mayor of Casterbridge. His life took another twist 20 years later when his wife and daughter came back to his life plus a few more other characters adding on the complexity of his life.Soonafter events unfolded and many things became to go against his way and then came his downfall. Indeed Michael Henchard's rise and fall were filled with compelling details and his encounters with numerous intestering people.<br />What I love most about this novel was the way Hardy depicted Henchard's behaviours and thoughts and totally enhanced his weak character and irresponsibleness with dashes of ironies. His sardonic literary style were brilliant and at the same time he also vividly described the scenery and situations. Another greatest of Hardy was his ability to create innovative characters still account for in modern contemporary days and he was a pioneer in analysising human's weakness and  blended it into his creation. It's a vintage classic,psychoanalytic and intriguingly written ,a must read for all books lover.tuations.

All the reality and poverty his faced. As the eldest son,he beared extra responsibilities and was less happier as compared to his cute,cheerful brother Malachy and many other brothers.  He had irresponsible but pathetic parent, poor living conditions  but a great hunger for knowledge and a dream to go to America.<br />His memoir filled with dramatic twists and intriguing events such as his days as a postman and his troubles with his sore eyes....

Presented in a more approachable and more 'easy to digest' format.  It provided a general understanding of ethics and reality.  Jostein Gaarder transformed elaborate philosophy into an intriguing puzzle game. Maybe Socrates and Plato would be proud of this too. <br />Before this my knowledge are scattered and incomplete. It gave a briefing to Western Philosophy. <br />Although there're several DRY parts. What I love about it is the way Sophie discover that she is actually a character in &quot;Sophie's world&quot;. That's a groundbreaker to read the character finding out that she is fictional. That make me wonder who i am and just like the first note Sophie found in her mailbox....&quot;who are you??&quot;..<br />I felt that Jostein Gaarder merely created Sophie as a bridge...linking one end(readers) to the other side(great world of complicated Philosophy). Sophie did help to ease the dryness at times. Using a 15 yrs old to ask questions and raise awareness of western philosophy, the character has a vast imagination and dare to ask anything on her mind and things presented in more interesting manners, that's benefiting readers since the subject is so serious.<br />What's so enchanting is that sequencing of events and the linkage of the entire universe through unfolding events. There're so many things and people to relate. Practically everything under the sun were covered.From garden of eden to renaissance plus a touch of modern days....<br />With many educational examples and little stories of life being depicted...they all have morales and double meaning behind them like my fave--example of letting go---that one about the centipede great at dancing but with a few comments from an envious tortoise(asking how she did it with so many legs?),centipede began questioning itself and doubting, never being able to let it go and stop dancing altogether. <br />Philosophy is such a huge topic involved almost everything in the universe. It can be break into many areas. This book help to raise awareness to it.<br />In-depth reading can be obtain through intensive reading by individual era like either early Greeks or Plato , John Locke or the more contemporary Bertrand Russell.  Plato's philosophy is a must for Philosophy reading. His thoughts and dialogues were authentic.<br />All in all,Jostein Gaarder did a marvelous task to summarize history of Western Philosophy into a 500 over pages book.	2000-11-30

She expereinced failures and distress and with unstable mind plus a little this and that lead to mental illness which eventually lead to suicide. Plath depicted the whole situation and events so vividly. Only one been through those thoughts and suffering could relate.<br />Plath wrote it with so much empathy and conscientious. She was crying out for help to her mental unstableness and woe she was going through.  Through Esther, she voiced out her feeling, sorrow,emotions and those things going through her mind at that time. Only Plath will know the truth...<br />Since this novel was published a month before her death at 30.Wonder how come no one approach to help her.If at that time she had more love,care and support,maybe there's hope, or maybe not....	2000-11-28

His style of relating the story or I should said stories as there were inter-linked events and situations revolving all the 4 main characters.  This novel started with a tragic school bus accident on a snowing morning. Fates changed and questions asked. Who to blame? The bus driver? The weather? Or other factors? A lawyer was brought into the picture to investigate. He began the search for the truth. He never anticipated that his perspective of life and living would alter too. <br />This novel is uniquely written in a way which readers can see from different sides of the story. Aftermath of the accident was multi-dimensionally written. Every victim had his/her own perspective. The novel was divided into various parts whereby I could hear from people involved directly or indirectly to the accident. Revealing many dark secrets and details.. From Dolores, the bus driver to a young girl 's viewpoints showed how people react differently and what they do when the same thing happened. Amazing discovery of human nature's complexity and authenticity.What a cruel world! <br />Banks created intrinsic characters and vividly sequenced the events. This novel also had a touch of irony and realistic. It's cleverly concluded with justification. Quite a remarkable attempt!	2000-11-27

Five stories with different settings and morals but share a common theme-Fantasy. With interesting characters like humans,creatures,black magic, super power genie ,etc....<br />Their Fate and destiny were decided or affected by magical or mystical intervention.<br />At first I thought I was reading a children book.  After further reading those stories fascinated me and they have double-meanings depending on which aspects and prospectives we have.<br />I have my own interpretion to those tales which were purely my subjective views... Beside having a fun time reading fairy tales, I also learnt a lesson or two...  <br />This book consists of 4 short stories and a semi-long one namely \\"The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye\\". Each story entertained and amazed me in a certain way.<br />\\"The Glass Coffin\\" is a  tale about a little tailor's adventure journey in a forest. To me it's about making choices in Life....<br />\\"Gode's Story\\" is a tragic love story about a young sailor and a miller's daughter. It's illustrate the importance of having Faith and self-believe...<br />\\"The Story of the Eldest Princess\\" is about a princess's quest to restore the blue sky. The moral of the story to me is to set the standard and bearing consequences of own doings.<br />\\"Dragon's Breath\\" is a story about bravery, own survival and fear. <br />\\"The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye\\" showed me what is finding yourself, learning from your own experiences and not losing imagination and follow your dream.<br />All in all I found this book entertaining,meaningful and a good attempt for the idea of adult fairy tales which were not all had happy everafter endings....	2000-11-16

There're bits of flaws and loopholes here and there. It's like someone relating a past incident and sort of neglecting some little justification logically.<br />All in all,a tragic story well-written.<br />It's a page-turner.Totally intriguing,make me want to why, how and what happened.... Richard Mason being a young and novice writer shines with his conspiring plot filled with mystery,guilt,dark secrets(literally drawer secret),death,scheme,unlawful acts and lies,etc... The disposition of his protagonist's past with his love,wife and all those life events and eventually to his discovery of &quot;the dark secret&quot; were creditable well-versed. <br />With maturity and experience,Richard Manson will be promising. I'm looking forward to his next piece of work.	2000-11-07

Empathic description of human's feeling  and behaviours... It make you feel for the characters  especially Barnaby. He is so pathetic but so real.  Barnaby is an average low achiever. He has an indifferent prospective of Life. But there's something sparking about him.<br />I think it's a great achievement for a  female writer to voice out a man's woe  and thoughts so vividly. <br />&quot;A Patchwork Planet&quot; shines in depicting the genuineness of Barnaby. <br />This book is different. I think it's filled with sincerity and sensibility.	2000-11-05

Very literary unique and bitter-sweet  true story which touch my soul. I found the book and it is even better with  detailed description and sincerity. I particularly enjoyed reading the  letter-format of it. It is so warm hearted and just like reading letters  from friends. In fact I even felt a little guilty as if I am reading other  people's private letters...   This excellent book shines in drawing out the  cultural and social differences between London and New York during the  period of Frank and Helene letters correspondence. 84 Charing Cross Road  changed their lives.They developed special friendship,an unspoken love and  care for each other without even seeing each other.This is truly amazing! I  think &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; is one of the best book I had read.  Easy to read, great story line,literary educational and most importantly  touches my heart and soul.	2000-08-26
