Not only are his stories, graphic, exciting and compelling, his style of writing is nothing short of superb. Genuinly exciting, and often laugh out loud funny, all of his books are fantastic. When talking about the turn of the century past-time of \\"galloping lions\\" (described as \\"dangerous as typhoid\\") he writes:\\" THe elements recquired for the monotony breaking past time were a fast horse, a good rifle, a few lions and not much concern about the future\\".<br />Not for the faint of heart, there is a number of gory stories about the fatal encouters that people have, and some well placed warnings about taking any dangerous animal lightly.<br />A lot like his first book, \\"death in the long grass\\" Capstick writes about individual animals- with a chapter on the \\"big five\\", Buffalo, Rhino, Elephant, Leopard ( the best chapter in the book- beatifully written) and Lion. As before he relates his own experinces, plus encouters as described by his friends.<br />I would recommend Death in the LOng Grass as a first Capstick book, but this is still most highly recommended.	2002-12-26

A well developed plot, realistic story line, and pretty vivid combat scenes/ I was hoping, and looking forward to a read equivalent to such WW3 classics as &quot;arc light&quot;, &quot;protect and defend&quot; and &quot;red storm rising&quot;&gt; The book just, well peters out towards the end. Story lines are abruptly closed, and plot points just fizz. The ending, is, well just flat, and frankly a little dull. You will finish the book, and probably enjoy the first 2/3's, but I doubt you will go back to it.<br />The other problem is the clunky writing. The authors use brackets to explian everything. (and I mean everything). Instead of inserting the meaning of a military phrase or concept into the text, or have a character explain it, the authors merely use barcakets (about every paragraph in places). This shows very poor editing, (and is mightilly irritating after a a while). I do appreciate that some military concepts maybe baffling to the reader without a military background (which is a few of the readers I guess) (and you can see how annoying this gets), it should be better explained.<br />Grade: C-	2002-12-17

Hathcock was a talented shot, who with uncanny skill in the battlefield reached such a stage of notoriety that the NVA put a bounty of three years salary on his head. <br />His exploits are legenadary and show that Hathcock was as brave as a lion. At one stage him and his spotter took on a company of NVA regulars in a five day running battle. Perhaps even more telling, there is some attention paid to Hathcocks sheer tenacity in recovering, and returning to duty after suffering severe wounds. This is actually pretty inspirational stuff, and shows the sheer force of will that Hathcock had.<br />Readers with an interest in rifle craft, the Vietnam war, and general military history will enjoy this book. I think that even a casual reader of military history will enjoy this as well.<br />One gripe mind you- the photos in the edition I have are of very poor quality indeed and show very little being printed on newsprint as oppossed to glossy paper. Most disappointing.<br />Grade: A-	2002-12-17

In my most humble opinion, HP LOvecraft is a true horror writer. Horror is not, adopting HP's view of the world,  a Freddy Kruger slashing to bits teenagers, or a world over run with zombies- the REAL horror is a wholly uncaring universe, with human efforts and endevours meaning absolutly nothing. The Cthulu mythos , as it is called, all flows from that basic concept- the universe, and the &quot;great old ones&quot; that populate parts of it, do not care for human endevour and that is enough to drive one mad. This philosophy is well reflected in the chilling opening lines of the &quot;The call of cthulhu&quot;- &quot; &quot;the most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents&quot;.<br />With that in mind this is an excellent introduction to HP. It contains a mix of his more serious and well known works &quot; The Call of Cthuthlu&quot; and &quot; The rats in the walls&quot;, to some of the more obscure and self parodying works. This is not the full stretch by any imagination, but serves as an excellent intorsuction to a writer whose influence cannot be understated. There are some very short stories, plus the a selection of the longer ones in the canon.<br />Joshis intorduction, and footnotes while from time to time are distracting are scolerly and informative. All in all this is THE best introduction to HP.<br />Bear in mind that the Cthulhu mythos is not for all readers. If you are expecting more direct and blunt horror such as King, you will be disappointed. If you want thought provoking writing, that will get you thinking and linger with you after you turn off the lights you will not be disappointed at all.<br />Grade: A++	2002-12-10

It certainly suceeded, and admirably so for a book of its smaller size.<br />As is noted below, the topic of Roman warfare is vast, and is alos worth considering that a lot of the specialist knowledge is buried in specialist academic works, and generally inacessable to the general reader, and unable to act as a general introduction. <br />This work serves as an excellent introduction to the topic, by placing the history of the Roman army in context , and relating that to the evolution of tactics and weapons, and relating that to the social and political developments in the Roman empire. It is well illustrated with photographs of surving materials, and even more impressivly, diagrams of key battles. The latter were most enlightening.<br />All in all I was highly impressed with the book. It is not deep by any stretch, but for the novice, you will do no wrong. I am not an expert, but I dont think a person with greater than passing knowledge will learn much from this. <br />Grade: B+	2002-12-10

I bought this for my Sister and when it arrived just had to have a little peak inside. Two days later, I am looking for another copy to get her.<br />I normally dont read this kind of thing, but once I started into it I could not put it down.<br />As a story of rock and roll excess, and the metal scene of the '80's and 90's this is interesting enough. From the background of the band at school and home, to the rise to sell out arenas, that makes a pretty interesting read. The Human drama, and raw honesty o fthe book is incredible and makes it very hard to put down. There is an inevitable amount of ego stroking, but the underlying human stories here are quite incredible. The part where Tommy Lee describes going to jail, where Vince Neil lost his young daughter to cancer are compelling.<br />Even if you are not a dedicated fan of Motley Crue, and just have a passing interest in there music, I think you will find this a most rewarding read.<br />Highly recommended.<BR>Grade: A+	2002-12-10

The central dude, Barney Rivers hits on a scam to make a small amount of money. Enlisting help from his mates, it all seems to go very well- until the dude from whom the money was stolen comes looking for it, leaving him and his friends with seven days to prepare for the final confrontation. <br />Written in tight terse prose, and progressivly getting more exciting, the last few chapters are virtually unputdownable.

The book covers a number of famous hunts, and the standout really is the famous Man eaters of Tsavo (imortalised in \\"the Ghost and the Darkness\\" film). <br />The stories by themselves would be gripping enough, but with Capsticks absolutly delightful style- he would make a Motorcycle repair manual amusing- the book is a gem.

This is an incredibly good module, and its size and scope is breathtaking.

This is a really good thriller gentle reader, and very hard to put down.<br />The plot is basically this- the FBI stumble across what appears to be a training area for three snipers in the Arizona Desert. At the same time, a retired SAS Seargent is sent to the USA to track down a major IRA leader that he has a personal score to settle with. Needless to say the two plots rapidly intertwine.<br />For a thriller the characters are remarkably well sketched and lifelike. There is not the needless romance with the feisty partner/ lab technician/ victim that has become a cliche, and in fact the central character is happilly married, and has a fight with his wife. Both central characters have alcohol problems, but not in cliched way either- both are thoughtfully sketched out. Leathers style of writing is excellent. Although he jumps from character to character at no time does the plot lag. His writting is crisp, and reflects the pace in which the reader will enjoy the book.<br />The plot is nail biting, and realistic. Twists and turns abound, and frequently quite unexpected twists occur.  The final few chapters are gripping, and almost impossible to put down.<br />Interestingly, with some knowledge of firearms, this is a technically correct book. A .50 Cal rifle can do a 2000 yard shot, with a good rifle and a great shooter,<br />Like I said, I am surprised that this has not been reviewed before, this is an excellent novel and most higly reccomended.<br />Grade: A+	2002-11-08

You have the good guys, led by \\"Iceburg\\", his nerdy brother, and his ex girl friend. Iceburg has a broken foot. The leader of the hostages is pain, and argues with Iceburg. Iceburg has to rescue his girlfriend. He does that by stealing a chopper. Its cliche city in other words. You name the stereo type, plot device seen in any number of action movies and books and it is here.<br />Having said all that, you will probably enjoy the read. Its face paced, frantic, and has even a few one liners that will make you laugh out loud. The characters have no depth at all, but who cares, this is an action thriller, not war and peace. And if you do want fast paced, exciting action, this is a great book for it.<br />You will probably enjoy this one, gentle reader, but take it for what it is- a few hours of light entertainment ( i read it in three days, and that was for a few hours a day), that will be put on your shelf and probably not touched again.<br />Grade: C	2002-11-06

Pretty much THE standard firearms reference text. For the beginner the task of choosing and recognising a cartridge can be a tad confusing at best ( A simple example will suffice- this round is a .22 rimfire. Is it a .22 short? a .22 Long? A .22 Long rifle? a .22 shot cartridge? a 5mm rem. Magnum? a .22 Win. Mag?- you get the idea. Lets not even start on .30 Cal. Magnums!)<br />This is the authortive guidelines on every cartridge ever produced, with short history, ballistics and so on. Handloaders, and collectors must have this- hunters might manage to live without.<br />There are some opinions scattered throughout the book, but nothing in those is particully worrying- there is certainly no opinion that I would consider dangerous or worrying. And even if there are opinions which you might disagree with, gentle reader, this is still the only book that I am aware of that goes into such depth on such a range of cartridges.

It does not restrict itself to a particular brand or product, but rather generic terms ( i.e. loads for a 156 grain .308). <br />The manual starts with an introduction, and goes through a useful step by step guide on how to craft your own ammo. At all times, the manual is well illustrated with clear and appropraite photos. Chapters on rifle and pistol are there, as well as a useful treatise on the perils of pressure. And, of course, Harvey is at pains to point out safety at all times, and even illustrates that point with ample photos.<br />All popular calibers are covered although you will not find the more obscure rounds in here.

Well, there is so much more to this fantastic ( slight pun intended) series. Firstly, although you do have fantasy elements ( dragons, the rather disturbing and hard to kill \\"Others\\"), you do not have any of the other tired cliches- there is no happy elves dancing in the forest, no missing sword/ring/stone that needs to be found, and no cute teenage characters who will soon gain power and blah blah overcome anchient evil and save the world. Put another way, this saga has none of the cliches that have so dogged modern fantasy. It is in short, gentle reader, turned the whole concept of fantasy upside down.<br />The novel is best described as a remarkable historical epic with fantastical overtones. Very few novels, and fewer yet fantasy novels have the sheer sweep and grandeur of this book. The plot is intricate yet dare I say it believable, the places well sketched, and the characters in turn lovable or loathsome. No other book has led to such heated discussion amongst readers as to which charcters they like or hate the most- and I am sure that you will find one that you identify with.<br />Martin is a very talented writer. Despite the vast sweep of the saga, the numerous and complex subplots, and incredibly writing the same action from the point of view of over a dozen central characters at no stage does the plot lag, or a unbelievable plot device inserted. He richly descibes scenes and characters, battles and places.<br />Any one who has trawled trying to regain the sense of delight from when you first read \\"the hobbit\\" or the Belgariad before it got tired would love this book. Even a general ready looking for a \\"fairy story\\" for adults would enjoy this.<br />As highly recommended as one can get.<br />Grade: A++	2002-11-04

The story itself is riviting, and the book has some incredible photos. (the one of Simpson after the events described is amazing).<br />The book itself is short and pithy, most readers will finish it in less than a week.

Safety is emphasised, complete with enough horror stories to ensure one is always careful.<br />Basic loading techniques are covered- flintlock, and cap lock for all types of firearm. The illustrations are clear, and the text nicely liad out and readily understandable by even the most novice shooter. Even the expert would learn a lot from Fadala in some of his tips- I certainly did. The rest of the book covers loads for practically all (I certainly am unaware of any brand that has been missed) blackpowder and pyrodex muzzle loaders in the market today. Loads are suggested together with ballistics. I have checked the figures with my own rifle and they are spot on. Everything is covered from .75 Cal Smoothbore \\"Brown Bess\\" Flintlocks to .32 cal cap lock squirrel guns.

There are no happy el  ves dancing in the forest c start with, and characters hardly gain in abilities. The bad dudes you are fighting are impossible to kill. Your character can go nutty, and become a non player character. One shot can kill your character. You dont fight much, becuase if you do, you die. This is role playing with a difference.<br />Call of Cthulhu is set in the dark worlds of H P Lovecraft. Characters (or better \\"investigators\\") are ordinary people- journalists, doctors, reporters, police- drawn into discovering that there is more to the world than meets the eye and the hand of ancient dieties is behind supernatural goings on. That haunted house down the street may be a result of more than a mere ghost- it could be an an anchient deity trying to re enter the earth. Sounds a bit dull huh? And, if you are a \\"hack and slash\\" RPG player it may well be. Where Cthulhu shines is its remarkable ability to create real feelings of fear and dread as you sneak around haunted houses. The mythos is wonderfully sketched, and the rules are readily understandable. You should be ready to play in about one hour. Combat is straightforward, although quite deadly.<br />The game can be set in any era, such is its flexibility. We played in 1860's London, it can just as easily be 1880 Auckland, 1920's Chicargo ( that is the \\"typical\\" era) or if you are hankering for a \\"X Files\\" experince, in the modern day.<br />This rule book is VERY high quality. Thick cover, OK illustrations, nicely laid out. It even has a reprint of the title story.<br />I can honestly say that in the hands of good experinced players and referees you will have one of the best role playing experinces ever. In one game I played a few years back it got so creepy one of players had to stop as she was getting too \\"freaked out\\". and how often can you say that you have had that experince playing D & D?	2002-11-01

The pace just crackles along, and the last few chapters will find you hard pressed to put down- you certainly will be reluctant to turn the light out and go to sleep when there is three chapters to go!<br />The plot gentle reader is quite simple. Although it starts in the present day, when the first person narrator inadvertantly finds the burial site of 14 german paratroopers in a church yard in England, the story rapidly takes you back to 1943 when Himmiler tasks one of his Officers with an insane mission to kinap or kill Winston Churchill himself. The action rapidly flicks from the preparation for the mission, the cast of charcters in the UK ( Spies, US rangers and so on) and the final battle.<br />No real surprises in this book ( after all, you KNOW Steiner dies from the very forst chapter) but the rapid pace of the book makes up for that. In addition, the story is believable, and it (almost) reads like none fiction.<br />Great stuff.	2002-10-31

The plot is a tad unbelievable- a hideous disease has gone through the world, turning everyone to vampires, leaving the central character as sole survivor. During the night, you have the compelling and gripping scene of the central character locked up in his house, surrouded by crosses and garlic to keep the vampires out, while listening to classical music to drown out the sounds of them trying to get in.<br />During the day the central character is out with his stakes and mallets, doing the impossible task of staking as many as he can before the sun goes down again..<br />This is the essence of the plot. It is impossible not to idnetify and sympathise with the central character and ask yourself the question:&quot; What would I do in this situation?&quot;. Written in taunt, crisp sentences the story carries itself admirably, although the ending, while memorable seems a bit abrupt. Aside from that, gentle reader, this is a great read, and one you will find impossible to put down. Like &quot;The Stand&quot; this is a rare blend of drama, horror, and &quot;post Apocalypse&quot; writting, and well worth your money. It will stay with you for days.	2002-10-28

Along the way, as is foreshadowed above they tell their own stories of survival, as well as interview numerous people- a british navel officer, a canadian banker, a former cabinet menber, a priest and so on. This is combined with the stories of the central narrators who not only reveal their own stories, but tell of their travel.<br />The central premise is not so much a full collapse of society, but rather a broken and battered United States, with States and territories leaving the Union, independence movements and dependent on overseas aid primarily from the United Kingdom, and Japan.<br />All in all a solid novel, enjoyable and very readible. Because in many cases the interviews with people are short, you are often left wandering what happened to them in the finish. Well worth a read, and not just by &quot;apocalyptic&quot; fiction fans. Its better than &quot;the stand&quot; anyway.	2002-10-28

There is a reasonably lengthy discussion of calibers which is largely obsolete- the .222 has been replaced by the PPC range of rounds.<br />There is some information that is of use to the general shooter, on such topics as wind and handloading for accuracy, although the experinced shooter will find little of use there.<br />So, all in all a worth while tome, although not benefical to many beyond benchresters.	2002-10-24

This is one of his better works ( not to say that any of his writings are poor) and it is an entertaining read.<br />As a preliminary point , Gentle Reader, do not out expect to put this one down and go &quot;wow- my life has been changed forever!&quot;- its not that sort of book. However, if you want pulse racing, page turning excitment about exotic places and animals, then you have come to the right place. This book alone will have you surfing the web looking for a guide, and pricing a .375 Holland and Holland for your own safari.<br />The book is divided into a chapter on each of the various nasties in Africa that want to eat you, or at least do serious harm to you- elephant, cape buffalo, rhino and of course lion. In each one he normally relates a story of some poor person getting munched on by one, and the cavalry ( usually capstick and his trusty spear tracker &quot;Silent&quot;) coming to the rescue. This is always mixed in with plenty of other stories and information about the animal of choice. This may all seem a bit repetative, but Capsticks fantastic flair for writing, and lively and amusing prose make this anything but dull. For example, in the opening chapter he describes that if the word got out on just how many people get eaten by lions in Africa it would be as &quot;popular as a social disease in a bible school&quot;.<br />You get the idea.<br />Armchair adventurers, hunters, and those wanting a good yarn- this is for you. Highly recommended.	2002-10-22
US	36171988	R2GMTMCSIC50XV	0738863416	433129357	This Is Not an Assault: Penetrating the Web of Official Lies Regarding the Waco Incident	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Excellent, balanced, compelling	I picked this up as I felt like reading something a bit different, and a bit controversial. That was a good move.<br />Many books on topics such as this could be described (politely) as unbalanced, and whatever good ideas the authors had are forgotten in the mess of far fetched therories. Not this one. This is a balanced, rational, very well researched book. It reads well, and has excellent references. From a scholerly point alone the author has constructed a good argument that there is a lot more to Waco than meets the eye.<br />The main author is a lawyer who became involved in the Waco tragedy a few years afterwards. The first half describes his own involvment in the case, the research that he did and from that position of knowledge argues what he knows and what he has learned in the second half of the book. His arguments are compelling for a botched raid, a poorly planned gas assault and an effort to hide the reality of what happened.<br />Gentle reader, you will find this to be a eye opener, and if nothing else a good source of conversation for many weeks to come.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-10-22

I also enjoy travel writing as well, so this one seemed like a good read. It isn't. <br />The Author spends a lot of time ruminating on how he left some bimbo in Norway, and how this has spoiled his trip to NZ. How sad. A lot of space is devoted to this, and waters down much of the description of the countryside and more imporatntly the people.<br />Much of the people he meets are cliches and stereotypes. For example, he is tramping and runs across a guy who is trying to abandon the ghosts of Vietnam by being in NZ. Right, and of course how can we forget the cliched surfer?<br />He in many areas has a smarmy attitude, treating the locals as naive and foolish. For example, when at a race the PA announces that a sum of money has been found and if it is yours, you can claim it. he thinks this is highly amusing- I am glad I live in country where that happens.<br />He seems appalled at Adventure tourism, and the bush and forests should somehow be kept only for trampers. Well, if it gets people out of the house, whats the problem with it.<br />He spends a lot of space bemoaning the fact that hunting introduced animals is a popular past time here. For example, the fact the possums are generally shot in the millions- yet does not grasp that is a ligitamite and enjoyable outdoors recreation, and is alos preserving the native bush. ...  Not recommended.	2002-10-19
US	36171988	R1CDC2MZJ5QQ8A	0446611824	194776169	Cold Zero: Inside the FBI  Hostage Rescue Team	Books	1	21	46	N	N	Terrible	In many ways, gentle reader, this is a very compelling story. I admire the authors transformation from dull speech writer to sniper. His early days at the FBI, from first arrests to the Waco disaster are enjoyable, interesting and occassionally amusing. Much of the book is devoted to his before and after HRT experinces, so don't be disappointed if you expect it all to be counter sniper action. The insight into training, his early days with the FBI, and sudden return to a desk make for a compelling personal story.<br />However, when one reads his accounts of Ruby Ridge and Waco anyone who thinks about what he says cannot help but be appalled by his mindset and attitude. For example, at one part he sees David Koresh through his sights, and his expressed desire is to  shoot him and \\"end the siege\\". Great. Suddenly he is judge, jury and executioner. Its nice to know the FBI think that they can totally ignore due process and decide who lives and dies. He is critises the negiotators who were trying to end the siege and clearly favored an all out assault- and he did not even consider the possibilty of a peaceful resolution.<br />The book gets worse after that. He seems upset that journalists and the public DARE to quaery the way the operation was carried out and that one of the team may face charges as a result of Ruby Ridge. So , in other words, the HRT cannot have their actions checked and scrutinised by the public and the Courts as dies and should every Law Enforcement Organisation. Given that the enormous disasters at Ruby Ridge and Waco one should not be surprised, but much of the tone of the text is petulent. I would have thought that as a professional in every respect he would have had the courage to accept that his actions could and should be critised. Instead, he describes the anger the team felt when they were put under the spotlight. <br />Another example- he was not surprised or appalled by the Rule of Engagment at Ruby Ridge that allowed \\"any male carrying a firearm \\" to be shot, whether they were a threat or not. I would have thought that he would have been aware that the FBI, like every other Law Enforcement Agency in the civilised world just cant shoot people when they feel like it- it has to be self defence.<br />In the finish, this petulant arrogance ruined what could have been a great amd interesting story. <br />Not recommended.	2002-10-19
US	36171988	RILCYV77FR9TF	0671741039	907356964	Swan Song	Books	3	2	11	N	N	Not bad, but not brillient	OK, there are clearly some folks out there who really rate this post nuke yarn. And you can see why. The plot , briefly , involves a cast of characters who are involved with the central character of Swan, a girl with possibly supernatural powers. As was correctly spelled out in one of the other reviews the other central character is a destroyed, post nuclear winter land- and thatis vividly sketched and a well written description.<br />Although there have been some comments on the realism, if you wilfully suspend your disbelief you can cope with those. There are many technical flaws that have been touched on (i.e. revolvers dont have safety catches to give a very obvious one). The ending, to put it mildly is somewhat cliched and layers on the smaltze, but again you can cope with it.<br />All in all gentle reader, not a bad yarn, and in places page turning.<br />Recommended.	2002-09-29

There is lots of pelf written for people who fancy themselves as Green Beret Snipers, but very little indeed on the most basic principles of marksmenship. And there is this book.<br />Anyone who uses a rifle will benefit from this book. A begineer could not get a better teacher. A person familier with rifles will get enough information to progress to expert. And an expert will still learn enough to make the book worthwhile, or at the very least be able to enjoy Col. Coopers unique writing style. A Parent wishing to teach their daughter or son how to shoot would be well served with this as a gift for them.<br />There are 20 chapters covering safety (nice to see), firing positions, breathing, rests and so on. The Colonel does not usually go into much depth in the WHY of things- keep your barrel off the rest as it affects trajectery , without launching into a long discourse on barrel harmonics. Despite being reasonably brief there is a lot to comprehend and practice, so you will be dealving into it for some time.<br />The only gripes I have is some- but not all- of the ample illustrations are a tad over and under exposed so they are not as clear as one would like. This is common, alas, with Paladin books. Generally the photos are good and the dust cover is handsome.<br />Most highly recommended.	2002-09-29

Regrettably the title is a bit of a misnomer. The book focuses almost completely on the sport of bench rest shooting, with very little on anything else- such as accurate rifles for hunting, varminting and sniping. If you are a newby to benchrest then this is highly recommended- no mistake. If however, you are a dyed in the wool varminter, or use a tactical rifle for work, then you will not learn a huge amount.<br />So- for the benchrester a lot of good stuff. Bench rests, the match and so on. There are ample photos, and lots of stories of matches. Lots of &quot;folksy&quot; stories as well. This is better suited for the beginner and intermediate shooter. <br />For you varminters, tactical shooters and full bore match shooters, the chapters on wind shooting, are excellent, but there is little new in them.<br />All in all, useful enough for most rifle shooters bookshelves, but not a &quot;must have&quot;. If you are a benchrester- recommended.	2002-09-21

I thought I had a very considerable knowledge of ballistics-both &quot;in flight&quot; and terminal, but then I read this book. It has information on everything connected to the way a bullet behaves, and covers the most obscure topics imaginable. Want to know how a rain drop affects a bullet? Its here. Want to know how many revolutions pre second your pistol bullet is going? Its here. Want information on whether a light load for your 7mm magnum will cause a detonation? Its here (it does, actually).<br />My only gripe is the type setting is extremeley dense, with poor paragraphing occasionally. In places this can make it hard to read, particularly with some of the more technical topics. <br />Overall however, anyone who is interested in the technical side of shooting should own this. Its a gem.	2002-08-26

Surprisingly he finds himself set up , and must use his wits and his Remington 700 to clear his name. So much for the plot. What you have hear is an enjoyable romp, with bad bad guys, good good guys and a few helpless women thrown in along the way. Bob Lee is a well sketched out character, and if you can you can ignore a number of serious plot flaws you will find a very enjoyable techno thriller.<br />Incidentally, as a shooter of some talent myself, most of the technical stuff is about right.	2002-08-25

It should also be read by anyone who believes that gun control prevents crime- this book shows the sad fact that guns dont kill people, people kill people.<br />The book is very textbook, and is not easy reading in places. However, the evidence presented that humans have an inherent repulsion of killing other humans is proved beyond any doubt. Where the book gets the most interesting is the comparison of military training techniques with the effects of modern culture- video games, television and cinema. When one considers the appalling spike in violence in the past 40 or so years, it is very clear that the autor has hit on a potentually chilling fact- are we training ourselves to be killers?	2002-08-18

As you can see below, two couples, two boats, one desert island, one murder. Half the book recounts what happened in Palmyr, and the second half recounts the trial of the two accussed. This by itself wold recommend it to readers interested in true crime/legal dramas, but there is one thing spoiling it....<br />The writer. Although you would expect a certain degree of self indulgence this is incredible. A few quotes: \\"No lawyer works harder in preparing a case than me\\", \\" I never defend anyone who I think is guilty\\", \\" My deamenor in court is some what freewheeling\\" etc etc etc. Now this would be OK in dribs and drabs, but it is almost every page and after a while it gets a bit annoying.<br />Still, well worth the money, and an enjoyable read.	2002-08-12

In short, if you like apocolyptic fiction, and dont mind some serious long sentences, and like books that make you ask &quot;What would I do? I wouldn't do that!&quot; Then you will like this one.

The weird desire to have the worlds highest dinner party resulted in a group climbing a dangerous peak in the Andes to achive this goal.<br />Although amusing enough the book has a weird undercurrent to it that really makes it the five star. In stating just how unprepared for the climb, and how silly the whole idea was, the real characters of the climbers ( mainly amateurs) is revealed. I dont think Darwin really intended this, but that is what makes the whole thing just so interesting.<br />I would have given the book 4 stars, but for one thing. The very sad epilogues revealling the fate of all the climbers, the break down in friend ship and the fate of one of them is deeply moving. For this reason alone i recommend this book.	2002-08-12

Their are obvious similarities with Tolkien, but that can be levelled at most fantasy except, say, George RR Martin. The plot is basically a long belived dead evil dude awakens , and as usual the heros must go on a quest to stop him. Brooks creates a delicate world, which is believable and well described, Descriptions of places and people are such as to make the world realistic. Where he excells is in two ways. Firstly, the characters are well drawn in my opinion and very likeable. i would be prepared to state that most readers have a character they like and enjoy reading about. Secondly, the battle at the end is well sketched, and exciting. Most readers will enjoy that battle.<br />Generally an enjoyable read, and no real complaints can be levelled- while not a classic, this is still an excellent book.	2002-06-13

As always, the character development is perfect and well crafted. The scenes are elegently described, and when this is combined with an excellent plot this work falls into the small pile of the very best fantasy there is.<br />I like the protracted battle scenes which give a sense of urgency to the heroes quest. The changing from scene to scene really drives the momentum of the plot. I find the romance, while slightly cliched still adds to the overall excellence of the plot.<br />While the Shannara series is a series, each book in the first three stand alone, and are only vaguely linked. After all we can't all cope with a 9 volume series (still going strong) like the wheel of time.	2002-06-13

Having said that this is still a very well researched book. His arguments are compelling and highlight a number of disjoint themes to a single compelling argument- the US won the war militarily and was only defeated at home.<br />There is ample evidence and the evidence is presented in a reasonably non biased way. His conclusion is quite compelling.<br />As an aside it is good to see the New Zealanders and Australians mentioned in some detail- this is the first US book ( that I am aware of) that mentiones the ANZAC contribution.	2002-06-12

If it is a truthful account of Sajers experiences (and perhaps we must all accept that memory is not perfect and no account will be a 100% accurate), then this is without a doubt in the list of very great autobiographys. Sajers accounts were harrowing and give you the very best insight into the horror that was the Eastern front. The scene in which he was travelling in a truck in the great German retreat with severe Diarrohea is one of the most gripping pieces if writing of all time.<br />If it is not true, then one star.

Sebastians transformation from bored small town hick to member of the SS is just that, but on a big scale. Despite his terrible actions, Westland remains a likeable character- so 5 out of 5 for that alone.<br />However, where the book comes into its own is its dreamlike prose and graphic descriptions.

While not perfect by any stretch, it is a very good look at a side of the world that few appreciate in the West.<br />Firstly, the writing is acutly personal. The thing that prevents this getting five stars is the lengthy introspective part on his family. It doesnt really contribute to the point that he is trying to make- heroin and conflict are addictive, and it just tends to blunt the main messages of the book.<br />Secondly, the description of the characters and events he has dealt with are as good as it gets. I to have served overseas and the descriptions he uses are accurate and correct.<br />The book gives you littles insight into why the conflict occurs, but if you want to get an insight into the addiction to conflict and hatred that drives the war, the book is worth its price for the introductory chapter alone.<br />Buy it, I do not think you will regret it.	2002-06-11

This is not your typical fantasy. There are no happy elves dancing in the forest. Major characters die. There is not one hero with newly found magic, sword, lost inheritence whatever to save the day. Major charcters die. Good characters turn out to be not so good. Bad characters turn out to be not so bad. The characters swear, and drink and get intimate with each other. It is the realpolitik of the fantasy world. There is nothing else avalible which comes close.<br />The book achieves what few fantasy novels have - It has very real characterisation so that you and your friends can argue over who is the most likable, Secondly the plot, while VERY complex is well sketched out, has no gaping flaws and is, dare I say it- believable. Finally, Martin is a gifted writer. To jump from character to character, with EACH one having a seperate characteristics is quite remarkable.<br />I do not agree that the plot lags at all. The pieces are falling into place for a major fantasy epic, and from the introduction you know this is special.<br />I like the concepts in the book as well. The hints of loss magic, the Others, the detailed history of the seven kingdoms. Incredibly, tiny pieces buried in book one resurface in the following books.<br />Move over Tolkien, you have now lost your throne.	2002-06-10
