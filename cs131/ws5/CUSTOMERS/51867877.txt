There are detailed studies of the flora and fauna, the weapons, the medical aspects, the views of various Indian tribes on the interactions with the Corps of Discovery.  You can find cookbooks detailing what they ate, books about what they wore, stories of Seaman (Lewis' dog), and biographies of all involved.<br />So, what is the average person with a small amount of budding interest to do?  Even scholars and historians who \\"do\\" Lewis and Clark have a hard time keeping up with all of it, and most people don't want to invest endless money in accumulating a personal Lewis and Clark library.  <br />Stephenie Ambrose Tubbs and Clay Straus Jenkinson have come up with a perfect solution to this dilemma.  \\"The Lewis and Clark Companion - An Encyclopedic Guide to the Voyage of Discovery\\" is a wonderful reference book on many aspects of the Lewis and Clark expedition.  Arranged in alphabetical order, from \\"air gun\\" to \\"York,\\" each article provides just the right amount of information needed to understand each area.  Each entry is written in a straightforward style, giving quotes from the journals of the Expedition where they would be enlightening.  There is also an extensive bibliography, if you find yourself wanting to know more about any aspect.<br />Tubbs is a Montana historian and serves on the Lewis and Clark National Trail Interpretive Center?s Foundation Board and is the daughter of the late Stephen Ambrose.  She has spent much of her life traveling the Trail.  Jenkinson is a well-respected Jefferson and Lewis and Clark historian, and author of several books, including \\"The Character of Meriwether Lewis,\\" and \\"Thomas Jefferson, Man of Light.\\" He has traveled the Trail extensively and also does Chautauqua performances around the country as both Thomas Jefferson and Meriwether Lewis. They bring vast knowledge and lively and interesting writing style to this project.<br />Itis the perfect reference work for Lewis and Clark aficionados, as well as those who are just beginning their journey of enchantment with this epic adventure.	2003-09-06

It traces the evolution of the Supreme Court during the early years of our republic.<br />It frames this evolution in the thoughts of Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall.  We see Jefferson's thinking that the Supreme Court would be some sort of advisory board, and that federal law should not reign supreme over state law.  On the other side, we see John Marshall's strongly held beliefs that the Supreme Court should have equal power with Congress and the President, and that federal law should be considered superior to state law.<br />We see the various court battles that brought about judicial review and that cemented John Marshall's views as American policy.<br />A very interesting and thoughtful book.	2002-12-09

In this series of wonderful essays, Clay Jenkinson examines many issues, including the future of rural America and the Great Plains, Native American culture and race relations, spirituality, gender relations, academia, spirit of place and, ultimately, the soul of America. From his perspective as a humanities scholar and historian, and with great passion for his subject, Jenkinson uses these essays to encourage readers to examine some of the \\"big questions\\" confronting America as a nation and us as individuals, and does so in a way that is a delight to read.  As he says in the Introduction, \\"I have no confidence that I have any answers, but I know well that I am on to some of the right questions.\\" <br />You will meet all sorts of interesting people who will become part of your world thanks to Jenkinson's great portrayals.  Mike Jacobs, journalist, lover of North Dakota and revolutionary; Patti and Gary Perry, of Marmarth, N.D., a couple you would want in your corner in any crisis; several academics, some whiney and some wonderful; a lonely North Dakota bachelor, who we meet only through a peek into his house; some of the practitioners and supporters of the amazing art of Chautauqua; and many others.  Through these people and the worlds they inhabit you will get a new and vivid view of a part of America that few of us are familiar with.<br />If you have ever traveled the Great Plains, you most likely blew through them on your way to or from somewhere else. In this book, you will meet the landscape of the Great Plains in a way you have never met a place before.  This book will fire your imagination for the role the plains could play in reviving the soul of America.  This is a book for visionaries, thinkers, Americans of all stripes, and anyone else whoenjoys a terrific read.<BR>  <BR>It will tear at your heart, make you laugh out loud, stretch your soul, educate you, entertain you and, most importantly, make you think and feel. It will make you long to visit the Great Plains, and perhaps have them become part of your soul and your life.  As soon as you turn the last page, you will want to go back to the first page and start again. I would recommend that you buy at least two copies, and probably more, because once you have read it, you will want to give it to everyone you know.	2002-05-13

Their partnership was amazing and John could not have been the man he was (revolutionary, founding father, statesman, president, friend, husband and father), without Abigail.  She helped balance him, shared her intelligent and insightful views with him in ways that were supportive and helpful, gave up much of the life she probably envisioned with him so that he could serve his country in a variety of ways, managed his domestic and financial life alone for much of their marriage, and truly loved down to her core this sometimes difficult man.<br />This book is a great addition to our knowledge of this complex woman.  It is worth reading just to understand her better, aside from her well-biographied husband.	2002-03-26

When these letters deal with the personal, intellectual and political thoughts of three important figures in American history, all the better.<br />In this book, skillfully edited by Lestor J. Cappon, we see the inner workings of the minds of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.  The letters of Abigail Adams add so much to this dialogue, since she was her husband's confidante, sounding board and best advisor during a time when women were usually kept in the background.<br />These two men, while disagreeing about some of the issues of the day, saw the value in a friendship where &quot;iron sharpens iron.&quot;  Both were intellectuals who loved the exchange of ideas and the growth that comes from open debate. They also shared a profound respect and a deep friendship for many years, a friendship that clearly shines through their letters.<br />You will gain great insight into the politics of early America, as well as the friendship shared between these three founders of our country.	2001-01-17

If all history books were like this, we would all be avid students of history.  I found myself wishing that this book was 500 pages long, because it was so interesting and enjoyable to read.  If you have any interest in American history I would highly recommend this book.  If you have no interest in American history, I would still recommend it!<br />The suicide of Meriwether Lewis has always been one of the more tragic and interesting mysteries of American history.  Clay Jenkinson, in this book on the character of Lewis, is witty, profound, insightful, and highly readable.    We learn about Lewis' interest in food, his views on Indians and women, his longing for an important place in history, his drinking and most importantly, his view of himself. We see the Expedition through the unedited writings of Lewis himself and through Clay Jenkinson's perspective on what those writings reveal.  <br />In the end, we must still speculate about what was in Lewis' heart and head on the night he took his life, but we are left with a much better understanding of the workings of that mind.	2001-01-06

I believe that one of the marks of a classic is that it can be enjoyed by children and adults alike.  Well, this book certainly fit. I'm 11, and I loved it! Another is that it can discussed for a long period of time. I  finished this book a while before my dad and after he finished it, we  discussed it for half an hour.  There was quite a bit of symbolism combined  with Christianity to make you wonder for a long time. One thing that he  suggested near the end of the book is that everyone in our world has a  parallel in Albion.  I noticed a few similarites between Cynan and the old  Simon, as well as Tegid and Professor Nettleton. Lewis probably didn't have  one, since he was the hero.  Book Two ended without a cliffhanger and a  happy ending.  At the end, this one almost made me cry.  Too many plot  details have already been revealed, so I won't tell you anymore. This  trilogy is one of the best of all time, up there with Lord of the Rings and  Chronicles of Narnia.  However, if you are a kid, have your parents read  them first and make sure they're all right for you.  It's fairly graphic  and has some...ahhh...content. (If you catch my drift) I guess the point of  my review is: BUY THIS BOOK! You won't be disappointed.	1999-08-30
