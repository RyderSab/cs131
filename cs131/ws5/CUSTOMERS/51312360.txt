US	51312360	RVKDZKXX4XD0U	0141306408	548144015	The Sacrifice	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Recommended	I decided to read The Sacrifice after seeing some of the reviews on Amazon.com, and being intrigued by the plot description.  The book was even better than I'd expected.  I liked the fact that the Native American  culture stands alone without the author having to show the impact of the  arrival of white settlers--I can't think of one other book that's simply  about Native Americans with no Europeans in it.  Originality is always  good.  <br /><br />It's also an exceptional story, which should appeal strongly  to readers of all ages: the writing's simple enough for young readers to  understand, while no older reader will be bored with the story (I'm 16).   The book is historical fiction, with maybe a very small bit of fantasy, but  it can be enjoyed by readers of fantasy, adventure stories and historical  fiction alike.  I thought The Sacrifice was extraordinary, especially for a  first novel.  I recommend it highly, and I'll be looking forward to Diane  Matcheck's next piece of work.	2000-04-07

Now, I don't want to say anything bad about dear old Harry, in fear of being deluged with hate mail.  So, a disclaimer:  I *liked* Harry Potter.  Well, moderately.  I don't think Harry Potter is a  god or anything.  After reading The Sorcerer's Stone, I thought &quot;There  has got to be more than this&quot;, and so I went out to find Diana Wynne  Jones' Chrestomanci series.  <br /><br />Now I've read two of them: Charmed Life,  and Witch Week.  Both books surpass Harry in depth of character (etc.) and  in quality of writing, but Witch Week is the better of the two.  The plot  is intriguing: in a world exactly like ours, except that they still burn  people as witches, someone in a sixth-grade class is accused of being a  witch.  It sounds pretty serious for a children's book, but Diana Wynne  Jones treats her subject with sensitivity and humor.  (Some parts are  actually hilariously funny.)  By the end, all the questions you had are  answered, and everything is resolved in an unexpected but satisfactory way  that only Diana Wynne Jones could pull off.  Overall, an excellent  book.<br /><br />If you think Harry Potter is the center of the universe--excuse  me (don't insult anyone), let's start over,  If you liked the Harry Potter  books, you must try Diana Wynne Jones.  If you're really devoted to Harry  Potter, you'll probably never allow another book to take its place.  But  keep an open mind, and try to see that there are more great books out  there.	2000-04-07

It started out well, but went downhill.  There were parts that didn't seem to have been thought through very well; there were some problems I thought of that didn't seem  to have occurred to the author.  I didn't find it very confusing, as others  did:  Several parts *would* have been confusing, except that I wasn't  interested enough to think them over. <br /> Also, I didn't like Piers  Anthony's afterword much.  Although I could relate to it more than to some  of the characters in the book, it was filled with unnecessary details, and  it seemed very arrogant (&quot;I *am* a world-class writer&quot;, Anthony  declares). <br /> The plot kind of went nowhere (there was no very obvious  climax or complication), and there were several subplots that felt like a  waste of my time (Time, ha ha, get it?).  Overall it was an okay book, but  it's far from the thought-provoking masterpiece the back cover suggests it  is.	1999-12-01
US	51312360	R3SHQXNOPZBJH	1564026167	350167349	Weather Eye	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Excellent, especially the beginning	I found out that Weather Eye was a futuristic science fiction set in October 1999, so I thought it would be interesting to read it at the time  when it was actually meant to be happening.  Actually, it turned out to be  a very good story for itself--not only because of why I originally picked  it up.  It is quick-moving and very readable. The author tends to employ  very unusual adjectives and imagery, which is occasionally annoying but  often startling and appropriate.  By the end the plot does not fulfill all  the promise of the beginning and becomes too controlled by the message the  author wants to get across (Kids can do it!  Everyone work together and  let's save the environment!) and the writing gets a little preachy.  This  is unfortunate but does not spoil a mostly great book.  The characters are  well-drawn and interesting, and it is refreshing that there are no bad guys  or perfect people--they are all human. Overall, a very good book for ages  10-14.  Recommended.  Actually, I'm a little surprised it isn't more famous  than it is.	1999-10-24

I love Donna Jo Napoli's fairy tale retellings, so of course I had to read this one too.  But The Prince of the Pond was quite different--and, unfortunately, inferior--to Zel or The Magic Circle.   For a start, the  target audience was much younger than for the other books--third grade and  up, I'd say.  Also, Prince of the Pond had a light, slightly humorous tone,  which did not fit well with the bittersweet ending.  Pin's speech problems  got to annoying me, and it was never explained why he couldn't say  &quot;thh&quot; and &quot;rrr&quot; and &quot;ssss&quot; but other frogs  could.  And I didn't like the drawings much at all, which, I think,  detracted from my enjoyment of the story.   One of the biggest problems,  though, was the biology lesson.  At times it seemed like the author's chief  purpose was to impart scientific information about frogs.  These  &quot;educational&quot; parts tended to get in the way of the real story.   They were especially jarring because the book was narrated by a frog, and  it seemed quite odd that a frog should know all this, and even more odd  that she should talk about it all the time.  They use words like  &quot;metamorphosis&quot;, and there are sentences like &quot;Our  goggle-like eyelids kept out the water but still let us see the underwater  world.&quot;  And, &quot;Your stomach acids will dissolve his [a  crayfish's] hard shell.&quot;  (Frogs should just take these things for  granted.  I mean, humans don't go around saying things like, &quot;It is  cold today, but luckily I am warm-blooded.&quot;)  This, combined with the  very simple writing style, often gave the feeling of an elementary school  reader. Despite these problems, the story was engaging and quick-moving,  and I cared about the characters enough so that I was happy to find out  there was a sequel--Jimmy, the Pickpocket of the Palace.  Overall--3.5/5	1999-10-09
US	51312360	R2TOTWN7RI4EX7	037030425X	857778572	Swan's Wing	Books	2	3	6	N	N	Very disappointing	The story of the Six Swans has always been a favorite of mine, so I was looking forward to reading a retelling of it.  Unfortunately, Swan's Wing did not come close to fulfilling my expectations, and in fact bears little  relation to the original.   Most of the story is a pretentious, boring tale  of an artist called Matthew; he fills up the pages with his internal  conflict and self-doubting concerning his ability to create art, his faith  in God, and so on.  Occasionally the author remembers that this is supposed  to be a continuation of The Six Swans, and writes a little about Lothar,  the man with a swan's wing, who also experiences much anguish and internal  conflict.  (It is a very anguish-filled book, both for the characters and  for the reader.)  Then there's the sweet, beautiful goose girl, Gerda, who  must have been there for some reason but I can't recall it.  Ailanna, the  other reviewer, is right about this book; the characters are uninteresting,  and it is overly moralistic and melodramatic.  I kept having to put it down  and read something else.  I forced myself to read a chapter a day.   The  narrative technique was confusing.  For the first half of the book, it is  third-person, apart from occasional paragraphs in italics which are told in  first-person from Matthew's point of view.  All of part two is first  person.  I can see no particular reason for this strange technique, and can  only conclude that it was meant to seem important and literary, and/or the  author just felt like it.   I do not recommend this book at all.  I would  like to find a better retelling of The Six Swans to get this out of my  mind; unfortunately, I can't find a copy of The Seventh Swan, which is  supposed to be good.	1999-09-07

I hated the way everything was turned into a metaphor.  Can't we just enjoy a story for itself without it having a lot of different symbolic  meanings (which don't really work anyway)?   Overall the impression I came  away from _Enchanter's Glass_ with was that it was just *very* weird, and I  was disappointed the author didn't try harder, because there was potential  for a great book.	1999-08-21
US	51312360	R3PN1GMGEBD3OS	0425132153	624269601	Good Omens	Books	5	5	8	N	N	One of the best books ever!	My list of books that deserve a 10 out of ten isn't very long (about 20) but this one is definitely on there.  Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman make a perfect team.  My favorite part is about the four Horsepersons of the  Apocalypse...and the OTHER four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse, the ones  that aren't mentioned in the Book of Revelation.  Every time I think of  that it makes me laugh.   I have only read one Discworld book, The Color Of  Magic, but Good Omens is definitely superior to it.  I have read The  Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and half of The Restaurant, and Good Omens  is also superior to Douglas Adams' books, at least those two.  You want to  know why?   1) Good Omens is funnier.   2) In Good Omens you REALLY get to  know the characters and care about them: Anathema, Crowley, Aziraphale,  Adam... In just a few short sentences you get a perfectly clear picture of  who they are.   3) Good Omens is much deeper than the Hitchhiker's Guide.   It's not _just_ for laughs.  Dare I say it...Good Omens has morals.  The  morals are in no way overpowering or preachy, quite subtle.  I don't know  about you, but I like to have a little to think about in my books.  But if  you don't, you are sure to like Good Omens anyway.   If you liked this  book, I recommend Bridge of Birds by Barry Hughart; The Princess Bride by  William Goldman; of course the Hitchhiker and Discworld books; and The  Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife by Philip Pullman, which I always  recommend no matter what else you like.  Of course, you should also read  Neil Gaiman's other stuff.  I actually recommend reading first Stardust,  then Neverwhere or Good Omens, because the latter two are much better.  I  can't make any recommendations for Smoke and Mirrors or The Sandman,  because I haven't read them (though I'm desperate to!!)  Neil Gaiman, I  think, is my second-favorite author behind Philip Pullman, and that is an  extremely high compliment, coming from me.	1999-07-29

She never does everything perfectly, but messes things up, like most of us would in her situation.  All the characters were great, and the plot was exciting.  I can't wait to  read the sequel.

I wish all  fantasy authors could come up with such original, intriguing ideas.  I  especially liked the Sea of Dust (literally a sea!) and the apricoks.  Wow.   Thanks, Meredith Ann Pierce.   It's not quite as good as The Darkangel,  but very different, more new ideas and definitely a worthwhile sequel.	1999-07-04

The illustrations are beautiful and very appropriate.  Some readers have pointed out that the characters are underdeveloped--yes, they are, but that's not at all a  fault, as this is a story in the style of folktales, where the characters  aren't meant to be fully developed.  They don't have to be.  All of you who  were enchanted by Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy will want to  check this out.

There are some passages where &quot;the game seems to  be getting too real&quot;, and these are never elaborated on.  I was  disappointed because the plot summary on the back cover made me think this  was going to be more of a psychic/fantasy/ghost story; instead, it's  realistic fiction about a boy who just happens to imagine that he is a  Viking sometimes.  If that's what you want, then read this book, but if  you're looking for a fantasy look elsewhere.	1999-06-17

Harry Potter is an above average fantasy for young readers.  The wonderful details are probably the best point about the story.  (Take the game of Quidditch for example, the owls, the centaurs,  the wands and broomsticks, the giant motorcycle that appears only once, and  try reading the inscription around the Mirror of Erised backwards.)  It is  also funny at times in Roald Dahl's style (though inferior to his books).  It is even a bit exciting, especially towards the end.  I can understand  the way all the eight-year-olds, even 13-year-olds are all crazy for it,  but adults?  What did they see in it?  I was a bit disgusted to see all the  reviews by adults saying this was their favorite book ever.  (They must not  have read The Golden Compass.)  It really is no more than a slightly above  average, rather amusing fantasy.  It started out well, but as stereotype  after stereotype and cliche after cliche of character and plot were  introduced, I began to be turned off.  Take Malfoy for example, the 100%  evil and cruel bully who has henchmen to stick up from him and teases the  other kids about being poor (and of course you can tell he's bad just by  looking at him).  How ridiculous and boring.  Hermione.  Another  genius/nerd that studies all the time and can solve all the technical  problems for the heroes and be groaned at for being so stuffy.  She is also  nearly the only female character.  Hagrid, the big strong giant who turns  out to be nice, though a bit stupid, and has a soft spot.  I really agree  with the reader called Magda from Neptune who said, &quot;I didn't like the  idea of Slytherin. It seems like the author just wasn't thinking when she  decided there would be a whole house for the &quot;bad guys&quot;. I think  that's a shallow idea and also kind of cruel. Could you picture standing  there and finding out from the Sorting Hat (which NEVER lies) that you're  evil? I think Slytherin was probably the biggest mistake in Harry  Potter.&quot;  Go ahead and read Harry Potter, because if all these other  people liked it there must be something there, and you might get it too.  But  read critically.  Don't just blindly adore it (or any book, for that  matter.)  And I'm warning you, if you haven't read The Golden Compass and  The Subtle Knife yet, you're wasting your time with anything else.n Harry  Potter.&quot;   Go ahead and read Harry Potter, because if all these other  people liked it there must be something there, and you might get it too.

She is great!  This book made me anxious to read the sequel, Heart's Blood, and I hope she features more in that one and we get to find out more about her.    Another thing I like about this book is that it is not aimed toward  little kids.  It would be just as interesting for teenagers or even  adults--Jakkin is fifteen.  (In fact, parents should be warned that it may  be inappropriate for young children because of references to prostitution.)    The futuristic world is believable and engaging.  At first you will think  it is stupid the way EVERY character has a double K in their name, but  don't worry, that is explained later.  (Although I hope it will be  explained more fully in Heart's Blood.)   All in all, a good book, but I  think the sequel will be even better.	1999-06-09

There are some very funny moments and this is overall a good book.  It would be great for kids ages 9 to 16, or 6 and up if their parents read it to them.  It seems like it would be a great read-aloud book for an  introduction to fantasy.   I still like the first one best, by far.  The  first two titles of the series made sense, but the title  &quot;Calling on  Dragons&quot; doesn't have ANYTHING to do with the story at all.  The  dragons by now are very minor characters.	1999-05-27

It defines all the obvious Scottish words (aye=yes, isnae=is  not) but not many of the more obscure ones.  Whenever I came to a word I  *had* to look up to know the meaning, it wasn't there.  This doesn't really  take away from the story itself, though.   Zohariel@hotmail.com	1999-05-23

Just not exciting.  I like fantasy, but contrary to all the reviews that said &quot;Anyone who likes fantasy will love this book&quot;, I didn't love this book.  I prefer things a  little...deeper, more involving.  Like Sabriel and The Golden Compass.  It  also seemed too long; although it wasn't very long, really, I guess I just  wanted it to end.  It wasn't terrible, but it's far from the best fantasy  I've ever read.  And Arrow's Flight wasn't much better than this.   Trying  to think of something positive to say now, to be fair.  I love the cover  art.  This book is probably best for girls age 13-18 who like  not-too-serious fantasy with magic and strong (but not unrealistically  strong) female characters, and especially for those who like horses.  If  you like horses and fantasy this is YOUR BOOK.	1999-05-15

It's a serious story overall, but  also very funny: the author knows exactly how much humor to put into it so  it's just right.  I can't put into words what this book is like; you have  to read it for yourself.  Go ahead!   (I don't know why some people didn't  give it five stars.

Shade's Children is a rare book:  lots of excitement, romance, great characters, etc., but even better, there's a really interesting idea with lots of deeper meanings to think about and moral decisions, like in Philip  Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy.   &quot;Sabriel&quot; and  &quot;Shade's Children&quot; are both wonderful books if you like young  adult fantasy/scifi that is slightly more dark and serious than normal.  I  do, and now I really can't wait for Garth Nix's next book!  I've got to get  a copy of The Ragwitch.   However, the cover art by Leo and Diane Dillon on  the hardcover, although it's nice-looking, doesn't really fit with the  story:  all the children look about 9 or 10, but they are supposed to be 15  and up.  And the Creatures look nothing like I'd imagined them.  I do like  their art though; look at the covers of Sabriel and Wise Child.   If you  liked Tomorrow, When The War Began, Galax-Arena, or Ender's Game, you will  probably like Shade's Children.  There are things about SC that remind me  of all these books.   Shade's Children is VERY highly recommended for ages  14 up.  Just don't expect it to be another Sabriel; Shade's Children is  just as good (if not better) in its own, very different way, and if you  want it to be just like Sabriel you won't appreciate it and you'll really  miss out.	1999-05-10

Door in the Hedge is still only an average retelling of a few fairy tales.  The original  tales are just *okay*, too, not wonderful.  Robin McKinley never adds very  much to her retellings except length.  Maybe beautiful language.

If you've read the plot summaries, you're in for something very different to what you expect.  It is totally strange, weird and unexpected, but you can't help liking it.  In fact, it's really wonderful, in a quirky sort of  way.   The main drawback is that it would be embarassing to be seen  carrying a book with that hideous cover art (both editions, hardcover and  paperback).  I own the hardback and removed the cover while I was reading  it and only looked at it again after I'd finished.  Better that way.    Hexwood is for ages 12 and up, including adults who like sci-fi/fantasy.   Younger children will have trouble remembering all the pieces of the plot  and recognizing the characters.   By the way, fans of Neil Gaiman will  probably want to try this.  I've never read any of his work (I'm planning  to), but there must be some connection: it's dedicated to him.

It WAS a good book, there was nothing really WRONG with it, and I liked the characters, but overall, it  seemed just a little above average. Nothing worth raving about as some of  these other reviews do.  It would probably be very appealing to kids age  10-12 who like fantasy and romance and don't mind that the main characters  are 17.  (I know when I was that age I didn't like the characters to be any  older than me.  I'm 15 now.)   However, there are some great moments:   &quot;there was [...] a fellow seated further up the transport in a  one-piece skintight costume.  Coren's eye were drawn to him because he  suddenly thrust his arms into the air.  He was shouting, 'Grow, darn you!   Why aren't you growing?  It's not natural for arms to always stay the same  size.  Grow!' &quot;  Oh yeah, and in the very first chapter, Princess  Lenora's beautiful gossamer lace dress is torn to shreds by a flock of cute  rainbow-colored puppies that materialize out of the air.

I'm getting a bit tired of the animal communication already, and this is only the second book.  Don't get me wrong, I like animals, but I don't think they would act this way.  They're much too human-like.  And the  environmental themes seem a little too contemporary.   Also I find it hard  to believe that Daine likes domestic animals such as pigs-- how can a human  face talking to an animal that was brought into the world only so that  humans can kill and eat it?  How could the animal be friendly to her?   Daine is not a vegetarian-- the book is quite clear about that.   This  series, in contrast to Alanna, seems rather childish and reads almost like  a cartoon.  Song of the Lioness was much more &quot;mature&quot;.  I was  actually reluctant to start this book, whereas I couldn't wait to find the  next Alanna book.  However, it is a slight improvement over Wild Magic, and  Stormwings are (surprisingly) shown to have some redeeming qualities.	1999-05-01

Unfortunately, I don't remember Apricots at Midnight very well because it's been 3 or 4 years since I read it.  The plot (as I remember it) was about a grandmother who tells her daughter a story each night, each one  from a different patch on the patchwork quilt on the girl's bed.  All the  stories were wonderful.  I remember one ghost story about a girl who died  wearing a beautiful lace dress (it really scared me), and another one that  had to do with stuffed animals-- the patch was cut from the side of a  zebra.  If it's the same as I remember it, it's recommended very very  highly.	1999-04-29
US	51312360	R2150C8LJ7XKPV	0064471748	831177797	The Juggler	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Not recommended	The Juggler looked promising, but it wasn't that good.  Turned out boring and predictable.  There were some good moments, though.   The first review of this book seems to be placed on the wrong page by mistake:  Beran does  not get his tongue cut off.  I think that reviewer was talking about The  King's Shadow by Elizabeth Alder, which I have read.  (And I agree about  that book moving too slowly and not having a good ending!)	1999-04-28
US	51312360	R2J351H1QWXB85	0374341826	916785226	The King's Shadow	Books	3	3	6	N	N	I couldn't wait for it to end!	Basically, not much more than an expanded account of the events leading up to the battle of Hastings, with a couple of invented characters thrown in.  It started out promising, but no.  It didn't turn out very good after all.   Slow-moving, boring characters.  Not recommended.   Though maybe I am  slightly biased because I was also in the middle of The Golden Compass, and  I wanted to get this over with so I could get on with it!	1999-04-23
US	51312360	R3I3CWXEU3IPQB	0345321383	932766552	Bridge of Birds: A Novel of an Ancient China That Never Was	Books	5	1	1	N	N	What can I say?	Everyone else has already described this book perfectly.  It's a wonderful story!  One of my favorite books ever.   It is a combination mystery, historical fiction, and fantasy, but no matter which genre you prefer,  you're sure to love Bridge of Birds.  Take my advice, and the advice of all  these other reviewers, and read it!  The ending is so surprising (you  know... the duke of Ch'in...)  I would never have guessed.   This is one of  those books that sticks in your mind for a long time after you've finished  it, comparable to the His Dark Materials books.  Those books are my  favorite books ever, so for Bridge of Birds to be comparable to them, it  has to be good!    I was so glad to see that there are two sequels.  I only  hope I'll be able to find them at the library.	1999-04-22
US	51312360	R16C5635HE8NJ9	0440219515	673968030	Letters from the Inside	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Good book.  The ending is... surprising.	If you couldn't figure out what happened at the end... in the words of another reviewer (hope  she doesn't mind me quoting her):  &quot;read Mandy's last letter and the dream Tracy has twards the end!!!&quot;  I was  pretty sure about what happened, but the dream makes it almost certain.   Anyway, read this book.  It's good, but not as good as Tomorrow, when the  War Began.  The Australian expressions might make it a bit strange for  American readers, but not too confusing.   Recommended for ages 13 up--  younger kids would probably be disturbed by it or not understand.  The main  characters are 16 year olds (15 at the beginning.)  I am 15.	1999-04-16
US	51312360	R3S2KDMEUC1JLJ	0060273224	962868136	Sabriel (Old Kingdom)	Books	5	11	12	N	N	This is a great book!	If you've read the plot description-- which is something like &quot;Sabriel travels to the Old Kingdom to rescue her necromancer father from the Land of the Dead&quot;-- you might think that this is a pretty  junky horror-fantasy novel.  Trust me, it's not!  Yes, it's got un-dead  monsters and things like that, but when you're into the story you're  totally believing it and you don't stop for even one moment and say,  &quot;Wow, this is so trashy.&quot;  Instead, the story is very beautiful  and believable.  Unlike many books, I could really feel the danger of the  situations and I even felt afraid for the characters. This book looks long,  but it moves very quickly.  The unusual mix of technology and magic reminds  me of Philip Pullman's &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, but other than that  I don't see why everyone compares these two books.  They're not similar in  any other ways I can think of, but I would say that if you liked The Golden  Compass, read Sabriel, and vice versa.  I thought TGC was much better in  fact, but Sabriel was still great.  I really liked Sabriel as a character,  and I loved the idea of the necromancer's bells-- brilliant!  The cover art  by Leo and Diane Dillon is beautiful. I hope Garth Nix is planning to write  a sequel, or at least another book set in this world-- something like  Tamora Pierce's Wild Magic series, which are a different story but let you  know what happened to Alanna.  It could be Sabriel's daughter, a future  Abhorsen?  It seems like some things were left undone.  They never went  back and saved those children, or helped the fishing village.  Did they?  Recommended for ages 13- up, especially girls.  I am 15. PS.  No, my e-mail  address is not varied from Sabriel's name.  I chose it before I read this  book.	1999-04-16
US	51312360	RF92HASCNW4MY	0525456120	996901595	Zel	Books	5	15	19	N	N	Just the way a retelling of a fairy tale should be.	Unlike Robin McKinley, who usually doesn't add much to the tale except length, Donna Jo Napoli retells fairy tales and legends perfectly:  she doesn't stray too far from the original, and most importantly, she ADDS  something to it.  These characters have depth and you really sympathise  with them.  Who else could make the wicked witch so likable?   The writing  is exquisite and you won't be able to put this book down.  Read it.   One  more thing: it's not for younger readers.  There are possibly disturbing  descriptions of what Zel does after she goes crazy from being locked up in  the tower.  I am 15 years old, and I would recommend this book to anyone  from age 14 up. Also, make sure you don't miss Song of the Magdalene and  The Magic Circle, by the same author.  I haven't read Sirena yet, but I'm  sure it's good too.  I hope Donna Jo Napoli writes more books as wonderful  as these.	1999-04-06
US	51312360	R2ZLTH0KCU7LTM	0590937065	483977999	Song of the Magdalene	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Wonderful!	Miriam (Mary Magdalene) is made into such a real character in this novel.  Like Zel and The Magic Circle, this book is impossible to put down. I kept my family waiting for me at dinner for about 20 minutes when I just had to  keep reading. The writing is beautiful and the moral issues this book  brings up are very interesting.  It is a wonderful book set in a time  period that is not used much in YA fiction.  Did I mention, this book is  one of my favorites of all time?  The subject matter is definitely for  older readers--only ages 14 up (I'm 15)--but anyone old enough should read  it.	1999-04-06
US	51312360	ROTEIFZ558VO2	0525451277	120708575	The Magic Circle	Books	5	3	3	N	N	You'll never look at &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; the same way again.	Now, every time I read another version of this story (Hansel and Gretel), I think &quot;No! That's wrong! It wasn't like that!&quot;  You might be a little surprised at the fact that devils and demons and hell are all  accepted as true in this story, but you have to realize that it is a story  based on the beliefs of the time.   Although it is very short in length, it  is only appropriate for ages 13 and up.  (I was 13 when I first read it and  am now 15.)  This is on my list of my favorite books of all time.  It is  simply INCREDIBLE.  Read it!	1999-04-06
US	51312360	R1WIWT7P9F5P9	0688009387	887280747	The Blue Sword	Books	4	3	3	N	N	I wish I could give it 5 stars...	I was really looking forward to this, but I guess I just didn't see whatever everyone else saw in this book.  For one thing, I'm not horse-crazy.  The slow pace was a real drawback.  The author often writes  sentences that are, because she adds long, often uneccessary clauses in the  middle, like I'm doing here to show you, difficult to understand.  See what  I mean?  The whole book is written like that.   However, the battle scenes  are very good, the characters are interesting and the end is satisfying.  I  loved the giant hunting cats!  The world is also very convincing.  It did  seem a little strange that everything was so easy for Harry, but you could  say it was fate and Aerin was guiding her.   Some people have compared this  to &quot;Arrows of the Queen.&quot;  Well, I didn't like AOTQ and I assure  you that this is much better, so if you liked that, you will probably like  this. But you should probably read this anyway:  If so many other people  enjoyed it this much, you might be one of them.   Zohariel, age 15	1999-03-29
