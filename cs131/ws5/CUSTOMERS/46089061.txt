US	46089061	R1XCYG21E48XZV	0880641789	182846476	The Story of Britain	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	A great place to start or finish your study of British history.	As an American who has spent some time studying US history, beginning to study British history can be an intimidating task - there's just so much there compared to what we're used to.  In \\"The Story of Britain\\" Roy Strong tackles the ambitious task of covering all of that history in one book.  It is somewhat inevitable that it is tough to digest much of the content in one reading. <br /> <br />You fly through Celts, Romans, Saxons, and Normans; skip from George to Henry, to Richard, to Elizabeth, then Mary and back again; meet Walpole and Cromwell and Chamberlain and Churchill not to mention Chaucer and Shakespeare.  Frankly, it's a bit overwhelming.  That said - this seems like a great place to begin a study of British history; just enough to give you some context for deeper reading to come, or as a capstone of sorts for someone who has read a lot of British History and is looking for a way to draw it all together. <br /> <br />This book sets out to cover all of British recorded history in a managable length and does it with all of the weaknesses that have to come along with that approach.  That's not an indictment, this is a good book, but it's really not adequate to read on its own for someone who wants a deep understanding of British history.  Its author tells you as much in the intro.	2005-09-19

This book is just very well done.  Singh takes a topic that could easily be dry and confusing and instead makes it fascinating and clear.  He accomplishes this seemingly difficult task with apparent ease by using colorful and relevant historic tales to go along with the use and breaking of each cipher he discusses in his book.  Singh also demonstrates a rare gift for explaining complex mathematics in a manner that is clear and engaging even for a rank amateur reader.  <br /> <br />The result of all this is a book that goes into genuine depth on a very complex and technical topic without ever leaving the layperson behind or resorting to writing that would bore a more advanced reader to tears.   <br /> <br />This is simply a very impressive book and a really fun one to read.  It will leave you more knowledgeable about codes, ciphers, and encryption and how they fit into past, present, and future. <br /> <br />Vey highly recommended if knowing more about codes and ciphers sounds even mildly interesting to you.	2005-09-19

It's fascinating to see the divergent reviews that this book generates; for my part, I couldn't put it down.  The book creates a world and atmosphere in which you become completely engrossed - it is a disturbing place to be. <br /> <br />The story follows Joseph K while he is on trial by a seemingly arbitrary court system.  What starts out feeling like a cautionary tale about misplaced and abused power quickly gets stranger and morphs into a story of a deeper and more personal trial.  Before long, you notice that K is the one who seems to be doing the work of trying himself.   <br /> <br />I was left thinking for a long time about the meaning behind the story and a lot of its symbols and components - I don't consider the fact that I still had questions to be a bad thing.  On the contrary, this one left me feeling strangely energized. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for people who like philosophy, examinations of the human condition, or existentialism.	2005-09-07
US	46089061	R1QGHFLLXC9SND	0440304245	477593969	American Caesar	Books	5	2	2	N	N	See both sides of a man most see one-sidedly.	This is the definitive biography of Douglas MacArthur by a man who is one of the greatest historians and biographers of our time.  Douglas MacArthur is a polarizing figure, with most people adoring or despising him.  As Manchester points out early in this book, neither party really knows MacArthur well enough; to know the man completely means that you will see a phenomenally talented and accomplished man with the grave character flaws so common to people who accomplish as much as MacArthur did. <br /> <br />Manchester begins with an account of MacArthur's father, who was famous in his own right for his heroics in the Civil War.  From there, Manchester traces the childhood and West Point experience that shaped the man who was to be one of the United States' greatest generals of all time.  You learn of MacArthur's experience in WWI, his intra-war time in the Philippenes, his Pacific Theater leadership in WWII, his brilliant rebuilding of post-war Japan, and his handling of the Korean War, which eventually led to his fued with Truman and his downfall. <br /> <br />This book is long one because MacArthur did so much over such a long and eventful period in American history and because he was such a complex character.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand both sides of an American icon and for any fan of history or biography; this is one well-researched and well-written book.	2005-09-06
US	46089061	R14N7JE4HHA09O	0385334141	735242912	Mother Night	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	You can take so much away from this book.	Vonnegut tells the reader at the beginning of this book that it is one of his only books for which he knows the moral of the story - you are what you pretend to be. <br /> <br />In Mother Night, Vonnegut tells the story of Howard W. Campbell Jr., an American who lives in Germany prior to WWII and is recruited by the United States to act as a spy in Nazi Germany.  Campbell becomes one of the most valuable Allied spies of the war, but acts as a Nazi radio propagandist during the war, serving the Nazis as well, or maybe even better, than he does the Allies. <br /> <br />The novel covers the fallout in Campbell's life from his decisions.  It is a dark story, but it is told in a manner typical of Vonnegut, using humor and a free-form style to lighten the mood.  You get to witness many characters' judgements of Campbell, but none are decisive.  You are left to decide for yourself what you think of Campbell. <br /> <br />Fantastic.  Highly recommended.	2005-09-06

Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini	Books	4	8	9	N	Y	Funny and informative - a two-hour read.	This book is co-written by a doctor and a screenwriter who are both clearly frustrated comedians.  They tackle about 100 questions that you are just dying to ask your doctor but never would, either because of embarrassment or just not wanting to waste their time.  The result is an incredibly quick read that is frequently funny and often informative. <br /> <br />That said, don't read this book looking for too much hard science, because you'll only find it in about every other answer they give, but you will learn about the truth or fallacy of a lot of old wives' tales and be able to dazzle your friends with your new-found trivial health knowledge. <br /> <br />Recommended for anyone looking for a light read, having even a passing interest in medical/biological topics, or who just likes trivia and humor.	2005-08-29

Let's start with the positive, because there's so much here that's so good.  The Warrior Elite tells an incredible story.  As a reader, you get to ride along with a class training to become Navy SEALS.  Couch, a former SEAL himself, does a great job of capturing the details of BUD/S training so that you understand the challenges and trials these young men face to become SEALS.      You come to know the men of Class 228 well and you quickly learn the differences between movie SEALS and real SEALS (not many 6'3\\" 250 pounders to be found on the real SEAL teams).  You also have the interesting experience of simultaneously being inspired and realizing your own limitations.  It's almost impossible to read this book without imagining what parts of SEAL training you could handle and what would be your undoing.  You end up realizing that we are all capable of more than we think, but not many of us have what it takes to become a SEAL (far better candidates than I'd be fell out of Class 228 pretty quickly).    So what keeps this from being a five-star book?  The writing; and that's hard to say, because after reading this book you respect Couch so much for what he's accomplished as a SEAL.  Even so, the writing is mechanical, the structure slows down your reading considerably, and you will be painfully aware of the repetitive use of some unique phrases.    That said, Couch does give you a great view of something that most people will never see, and he does it from the perspective of someone who's done it himself.  This book is absolutely worth reading for anyone interested in the SEALS.  For a similarly great story with story telling to match its content, check out Inside Delta Force by Eric Haney.  The two books are great to read back-to-back to compare and contrast not only Delta Force and the SEALS, but also two different writers.	2005-08-22

This book has a lot of good information it - probably too much.  Unless you are really going to focus on something, it's very hard to remember more than two or three core ideas.  I am a casual runner - maybe two or three runs per week of three to five miles - and I really hoped this book would give me a couple areas of focus that would make my running safer, more comfortable and perhaps faster.  Instead, I got overload.  There is a single 2-page spread in this book that lists about 50 points to focus on in your running.  Come again?  That doesn't sound very Zen to me (I know it's a different Eastern philosophy, but you get the idea). <br /> <br />Dreyer ackowledges the length of the list and suggests picking out two or three of these ideas to focus on for each run, but you still need to be pretty serious to do that.  I don't want to consult a checklist before each run and I want to plug into my iPod and relax a little while I'm running. <br /> <br />In addition, Dreyer gives a pre- and post-run routine that would add about an hour to any run you wanted to do - again, more than I'm able to commit to this portion of my life. <br /> <br />If you are a very serious runner or want to become one, this is a great book (assuming you can handle a few funky mystical references).  On the other hand, if you are looking for two or three areas of focus to make you a better casual runner, they're tough to pull from this book. <br /> <br />Recommended for serious runners who are looking to avoid or recover from injuries.	2005-08-22
US	46089061	R10ZU739KTNIXI	0060875410	122518901	The FairTax Book	Books	4	17	22	N	Y	A solid presentation of one side of the tax story.	Boortz and Lindner tell you up front in this book that they are going to try to convince you of their tax plan's wonderfulness and turn you into a vocal advocate.  I don't recommend that you follow so blindly, but I do think this is a really good book for Americans to read and its authors make the topic far more entertaining than it has to be. <br /> <br />There is a bit of a tax revolution going on around the world.  The global economy is becoming more and more open and it's possible for countries to compete with each other on a more level playing field for jobs and business than they ever could in the past.  One of the ways countries are best succeeding in this game is by using smarter tax codes.  The United States, strong enough to ignore this contest in the short-term, has largely swept the issue of a truly reformed tax code under the rug.  Sooner or later we'll have to address the question or the economic results will become quite painful. <br /> <br />This book is a good place to start learning about the tax debate for several reasons.  First, it presents a quick and even-handed history of the income tax in America, showing that it hasn't always been the numbing certainty that it is today.  Second, it gives the reader an understanding of a politician's incentives as relate to the income tax and withholding.  Third, it shows you which groups have a vested interest in protecting the current tax code (think of the poor accountants and lawyers under a dramatically simplified code).  Fourth, it presents you with a radically different option from today's tax code, which is just a good mental exercise to see that there really are other options out there.  Fifth, it's been made easy to read, which certainly can't be said for too many books on taxes. <br /> <br />The limiting factor of this book is that it is definitely (and openly) written from one perspective, so it doesn't tell you the other sides (there are many) of the tax debate story.  I would certainly not letthat keep you from reading this book - just keep it in mind as you do.  The topic is too important and relevant not to get some background in it.  Countries like Ireland and Estonia have made enormous economic progress, largely on the back of progressive tax codes, so it's worth paying some attention to. <br /> <br />Highly recommended even though it is openly one-sided.	2005-08-15
US	46089061	RNR48P485UWKH	067179227X	926409967	Den of Thieves	Books	5	69	74	N	Y	Unbelievable story told with skill.	Den of Thieves is a snapshot of human nature showing its seemy side.  Stewart's book has a cast of characters you couldn't believe if it were a work of fiction.  The most brilliant thing about \\"Den of Thieves\\" is the range of villians in the book; no two come to their law-breaking in the same manner or embrace it to the same degree.  All of them find temptation (usually in the form of large heaps of easy money) too hard to resist. <br /> <br />Stewart avoids the temptation to paint all of his law-breakers with the same brush and just focus in on the nuts and bolts of the story's timeline.  Instead, he allows you to meet each individual and see how they became embroiled in Wall Street's worst scandal since the 1930s.  You see some of the simple unrepentant scumbags you'd expect (Levine most closely fits the bill), but mostly you see more complex people.  Milken comes off as a truly broken person who was never completely connected to reality in the same way most of us are.  Most of the players come off as ordinary people who, on their own, would have cruised through their careers in uneventful fashion if not presented with a tempting, lawless option by a more proactive criminal.  Each of the perpetrators has their own level of comfort with their involvement in the insider trading scheme.  Some are so uncomfortable that they get out of the scheme on their own, some cry over the money they can't bring themselves to stop taking, and of course some just think they are God's gift to the financial world. <br /> <br />You also get to see how law enforcement can work in a situation like this - sometimes it isn't very pretty.  You come to realize that regulators and public prosecutors are imperfect people in imperfect situations, subject to their own set of desires, temptations and problems.  Rudy Guliani's office prosecutes this case in the public eye while he positions himself to run for Mayor of NYC.  The SEC unwittingly committs a huge insider trade of its own by allowingIvan Boesky to unload his portfolio before the public announcement of his arrest and cooperation with authorities - so he can pay them his $100 million fine.  (It seems temptation's not quite as far away as the authorities think). <br /> <br />Great story.  Great character development.  Great lessons.  Highly recommended.	2005-08-15

Like most of Vonnegut's works, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" proves incredibly hard to explain or review. To sum up, if you like books that make you think, keep you on your toes and off balance, and challenge your assumptions about the way things are or should be, you'll like \\"Cat's Cradle.\\" <br /> <br />In this book, Vonnegut explores some familiar themes like the interconnectedness of peoples' lives and how, even from distances of time and space, unexpected and seemingly trivial interactions between people can have huge consequences.  Vonnegut makes it clear to us all that sometimes matters of huge importance hang on tragically small details.   <br /> <br />So if you like a book that will challenge you and make you pleasantly uncomfortable (whatever that means), give this one a read.  It won't take you long and you'll have experienced the world from an entirely different perspective - not a bad bargain.	2005-08-15

Lewis presents Western readers as much insight as he can into the mindset of the Muslim world, how it came to be, and how it is evolving today. <br /> <br />As is evidenced by Lewis being criticized from both ends of the political spectrum, his treatment of the situation seems pretty even-handed.  Lewis explains the strong sense and knowledge of history in the Islamic world that we just don't have in the West.  He discusses how politics and religion indistinguishable in Islam in a way that is completely foreign for those raised with our \\"Church and State\\" mentality.  Lewis discusses how Muslim countries identify with one another in a way that more secular countries do not and shows that hatred and violence are often spawned in unexpected and counter-intuitive ways and places. <br /> <br />You come to see that some of the things that we think of as our greatest strengths in a Democracy are often seen by Islam as our greatest faults.  Lewis also makes it abundantly clear that not all Muslims are Fundamentalists and that not all Fundamentalists are terrorists. <br /> <br />Lewis successfully lays out the inherent differences in mindset between the Western world and Islam.  He doesn't praise or condemn either one, but he does point out where he thinks the actions of terrorists have deviated from the teachings of Islam.  This book is pretty close to pure information and is good for Western readers who want to know more about a situation that will continue to impact their lives. <br /> <br />Recommended.	2005-08-05

It didn't paricularaly speak to me, which doesn't make it bad art, but it doesn't make it good art either.  It really seems (by Vonnegut's outright admission) to be written largely for the author's own benefit.  The problem with believing that is you're never quite sure when to take Vonnegut at face value.  That is a lot of the fun of Vonnegut; reading his books puts you into a state of uncertainty that is unfamiliar and stimulating - it's also disquieting. <br /> <br />Vonnegut has said this isn't one of his favorite novels he wrote.  It isn't one of my favorite Vonnegut novels either.  That said, it gives you an interesting glimpse into the mind of a disturbed genius.	2005-08-02

Turns out it was a great choice.  The story of Charles Ponzi, an Italian immigrant to America, is a fast-moving rollercoaster of a tale told with skill by Zuckoff. <br /> <br />The result is a very readable book with a combination of good lessons for its reader about too-good-to-be-true propositions, great characters, good history, financial lessons, and a tradgedy of Shakesperean proportions. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for history buffs, fans of character-driven stories, people in financial markets, and anyone who's curious to know the story behind the phrase \\"Ponzi Scheme.\\"	2005-08-01

I read it thinking it would be a fun diversion; a vicarious thrill looking into the lives of some guys I wish I could be - Eric Haney wasn't content to let me leave with that little. <br /> <br />I did get the thrill I was looking for at the beginning of the book as Haney describes the selection process for Delta Force and then the training he went through as a member of Delta.  This part of the story is what every little boy dreams about but few of us grow up to have the fortitude or will to actually endure.  You are right there with Haney as he learns to raid a room with live \\"hostages\\" sitting right there with live ammunition whizzing past their heads.  It's a fun ride. <br /> <br />Things change though.  You're also there with Haney as he sees more of the dark side of people than any person can see without being changed.  The thing that Haney does so well as an author is match his writing through tone and word choice to his changing perspective as a character in his own story.  He's clearly been able to put himself back in the frame of mind of 10, 15, and 20 years ago in order to accurately tell his story - the result is surprisingly deep. <br /> <br />You'll finish the book with immense respect for these people and their professionalism, an understanding that things go on in this world that most of us never hear about, and the unfortunate knowledge that people in high places sometimes put their own large-sized interests (read careers and reputations) ahead of the huge-sized (read life and death) interests of others.  <br /> <br />You travel Haney's path with him, from an eager, excited, professional soldier to a guy who has just seen too much to view the world the way he used to.  Through it all though, it never gets hopelessly dark.  Haney maintains a sense that things are still going to be OK, and that means a lot coming from a guy who's seen as much as Haney has. <br /> <br />Recommended for more than just fans of military memoirs - this is a great story told quite skillfully.	2005-08-01

Wow!   <br /> <br />There are so many ways to enjoy this book.  First of all, it is an interesting piece of history; you get an insider's look at how the CIA supported the Afghans against the USSR in the 1980s in the largest and most successful CIA operation of all time.  Second, it is a great story about politics and how a really good politician can use all kinds of unusual tactics to accomplish something he wants to get done.  Third, this is a character-driven story with characters so much larger-than-life that it is unbelievable.  You just won't believe that these people are real. <br /> <br />The whole thing reads like a novel, but you're learning history at the same time and being entertained all the while.  This is one of those books that just brings together several different ingredients into one great stew and the result is absolutely fabulous. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for even casual fans of history, politics, or character-driven stories.  Don't miss this one!	2005-07-25

Jamie Whyte is a kindred spirit for me; someone who is bothered by nothing so much as gaps in logic.  He isn't bothered by peoples' arguments so much as he is by the irrational way people argue.  He doesn't mind their statements, but he is driven nuts by the inconsistent thinking their statements expose.  This book lays out the most common flaws of logic and gives plenty of examples so you can identify gaps in logic on your own in the future. <br /> <br />Whyte's presentation is funny while insightful and instructive.  You come away from reading this book as a more savvy consumer of the information that comes at us from all sides in modern society.  Never again will you read or listen to the statements of journalists or politicians with the same eyes and ears.  Instead you will be a more skeptical, insightful, and harder-to-deceive information consumer.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended for anyone who is driven nuts by illogic or for people who want to become smarter consumers of information.	2005-07-25

I personally am getting more out of my reading since I began this book.  In particular, Leveen's ideas on selecting books to maximize your limited reading time and techniques to improve retention work well for me. <br /> <br />A quick read that will be elicit smiles and nods of recognition from book lovers.	2005-07-25

This is a philosophy book, but its popularity is a fascinating study in psychology. You've gotta figure that because it's short, different, and boasts the word \\"sh-t\\" in its title that people are willing to give it a read. Once they do, I can't imagine many of them truly like it, but I think they're afraid that saying they don't like it will make them seem unsophisticated. I'm here to absolve you of any such feelings of inadequacy.    This \\"book\\" is a actually a philosophy paper - which is fine; it isn't a very good philosophy paper - which isn't fine. After making the unsupported statement that \\"bullsh-t\\" is overwhelmingly pervasive in our society, Frankfurt spends 7/8 of this paper defining what exactly that \\"bullsh-t\\" is. I'll save you the reading: Bullsh-t is less than a lie, but is actually worse; you see, a liar knows the truth and respects it as the adversary of his/her statement. A bull-sh-tter, on the other hand, doesn't care if his/her statement is true or not, and thus has no concern whatever for the truth and is really far more dangerous than an outright liar.    I know this isn't a long book, but you could be 100 pages into a good book by the time you finish this one. Save yourself all of the comparing and contrasting of \\"bullsh-t\\" with \\"humbug\\" and \\"hokum\\" (I'm not making this up!) and spare yourself getting trapped into saying you liked this book to seem sophisticated and intellectual for people who haven't even read it.    Skim this one if you absolutely must know what everyone is reading, otherwise skip it and get 100 pages into a good book instead. Either way, don't feel like you have to say this is a great book.	2005-07-11

So little is known today about the Caesars, that Suetonius' tell-all book about the Caesars is an absolute treasure for us to have now.  Far from a dry, impartial observer, Suetonius errs on the side of playing the gossip - a choice which gives you even more insight into the culture of the Roman Empire than the text alone. <br /> <br />The book covers each of the twelve Caesars in order and focuses in on their backgroung before becoming Caesar, their route to becoming Caesar, their political/military/infrastructure accomplishments while Caesar, their personal habits, and finally their universally untimely deaths.  (These guys all got killed pretty darn quickly by their \\"friends\\") <br /> <br />If it sounds like a dry topic, Suetonius over-emphasis on tabloid behaviors of the Caesars keeps it from ever getting close to dull.  Highly recommended even for those who don't know the period.	2005-07-08

Once WWII began, Loomis turned his considerable influence, contacts, and talent towards improving the burgeoning field of radar to help the Allies in their fight against Germany. <br /> <br />The author is a descendant of a cohort of Loomis and the story includes what passed for real scandal in the stuffed-shirt Northeast of the 1920s and 1930s.  This gives the book a kind of tell-all quality that is good in that it gives you more insight into what drove the characters, but it almost gives the book a provincial quality in that the \\"scandal\\" only seems like one from up-close and feels far less so for a modern reader. <br /> <br />A well-written and significant history with interesting characters.  Recommended.	2005-07-05

Societal insight and wisdom are timeless and this books delivers both in heaping doses.  So central to modern life are this book's themes, that phrases like \\"tilting at windmills\\" and \\"Quixotic\\" hold a place in our consciousness even today.<br /><br />That said, I believe this book can be appreciated as excerpts for those who might otherwise be intimidated by its length.  The story is told as a series of tales, each of which is a minature version of the whole, so that a reading of three or four episodes would give the reader a reasonable feel for a work that is otherwise a very serious investment of time and effort.<br /><br />A classic that holds all of its relevance today.  Highly recommended.	2005-07-01

Before the cigar-chomping, top-hat-wearing portly gentleman hit the scene, there was a young man who nearly flunked out of school, chased war around the world, played polo, participated in the world's last meaningful cavalry charge, was a war correspondent, and escaped imprisonment as a POW in the Boar War. Churchill got around plenty before settling down in Parliament and this is Churchill's own account of that part of his life. <br /> <br />Churchill's writing is quite engaging, and the book takes his exciting life and brings you into it. As good as autobiography gets.	2005-06-15

The book is at its best, however, when it relates how the human mind operates before, during, and after making a decision. <br /> <br />Schwartz spends about half the book laying out the ways in which each of us conciously or subconsciously compare ourselves to others, get accustomed to new levels of fortune or misfortune, and constantly seek to improve our lot even when it no longer behooves us to do so.  The ideas he lays out are excellent for improving your own approach to life or to help you understand what drives other people. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for people who enjoy social-sciences and the often irrational workings of the human mind.	2005-06-10

His telling of history brings the people and times to life for the reader, usually bringing in the politics and science of the time to give even more perspective.  As such, I was thoroughly excited for this book.  Unfortunately it isn't as good as most of McCullough's work. <br /> <br />1776 is still a very readable account of the year of our country's Declaration of Independence with some well-researched history, but it doesn't have the engaging style and pacing for which McCullough is so well known. <br /> <br />If you want a book that covers essentially the same events and time period, I'd recommend another recent book, \\"Washington's Crossing,\\" by David Hackett Fischer first.  (The two are very good read back-to-back for compare and contrast purposes)  If you are curious about McCullough, start with \\"The Great Bridge\\" about the building of the Brooklyn Bridge or \\"John Adams.\\" <br /> <br />This is by no means a bad book, but there are better books by this author on different topics, and better books on this topic by other authors.  Recommended for history fans who want to cover all their bases.	2005-06-10

When history is written well, the Author brings an event from the past to life for the education, and more importantly, the enjoyment of people in the present.  What David Hackett Fisher created here is excellent history.   <br /> <br />The characters on both sides of the war for American Independence come to life and you ride along with them as they make their way through the trying, uncertain circumstances that ultimately lead to  the Colonies' victory over the greatest military force of its time. <br /> <br />The book is written perfectly for the average history fan.  It covers a broad range of characters and moves through events and time with enough depth to understand a each situation, but not so much that you get bogged down in details that slow the pacing excessively. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for fans of history.	2005-06-02

Friedman discusses how technology is bringing 3 billion Chinese, Indian and Eastern European citizens into more or less direct competition with Americans and Western Europeans for business and jobs. <br /> <br />Friedman is a fan of globalization, but acknowledges that it won't be a positive force for everyone, especially in the short term.  He also states his belief that love or hate globalization, it is happening.  Because \\"The World is Flat\\" tackles a huge topic that will play out for decades to come, Friedman's views are necessarily speculative; so it pays to think actively and critically as you read. <br /> <br />The book is well-written, entertaining, and covers its topic from a number of different angles.  When you're finished reading, you definitely possess a better perspective on globalization.  In my view, it could be about 20% shorter and be a better book for it, but I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to get a better handle on this powerful force that will continue to reshape our world for the forseeable future.	2005-05-12

Jeff Hawkins' day job has been the creation of the Palm Pilot and the Handspring Treo, along with the Grafitti writing system used on those devices.  His \\"hobby\\" - and a very serious one it seems from this book - is studying how the human brain works.<br /><br />Hawkins has been bothered by the lack of a unifying theory of what the brain actually does that makes it intelligent and the absense of a good book on the topic for the lay-person.  On Intelligence is his response to those concerns.  The book is one big hypothesis on what is going on inside all of our heads that separates us from even the fastest computers.  The crux of the issue is that our brains are pattern storage and pattern recognition devices that use those two functions to incessantly make predictions about what is coming next in the world around us.<br /><br />The evidence and explanations that Hawkins offers up are compelling and fascinating and his theory conceptually makes sense when you think about it.  In the end Hawkins happily admits - and we as the reader need to remember - that what he is doing is offering up a hypothesis for science to work with, prove and disprove as the study of the human mind advances.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the interested lay-person by an interested lay-person.	2005-05-02

One of my favorite books is \\"Catch-22.\\"  When you read Heller's book today, it's lost none of its impact - the message is timeless.  On the other end of the spectrum is \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" which reads like a hippie farse now, its message seeming entirely dated.  \\"Zen\\" falls somewhere in between, but closer to the positive end of the scale.    The book tells the story of a middle-aged college professor on a motorcycle trip, trying to re-connect with his son, a task made necessary and more difficult by the fact that our protagonist lost his mind in the recent past obsessing about a concept he refers to as \\"quality.\\"    The story follows our hero's attempts to pull the value out of the concept of quality while leaving behind the pieces of it that literally drove him out of his mind.  Many of the lessons that come out along the way are as relevant and valuable today as they were the day the book was first published.  That said, the book still feels a bit dated in a way that a true classic never should.    Recommended if you're curious what the fuss is about.	2005-04-25

This book marks the first time I've had to suspend my disbelief for a work of non-fiction.  Howard Hughes' life is so improbable that it takes conscious effort to remember that you are reading about a real person who actually lived the stories in the book.<br /><br />Given the magnitude of Hughes' accompishments in film, aviation, and in the development of Las Vegas, not to mention his astounding love life with nearly all of the biggest starlets in Hollywood history and several underage debutantes and his massive insanity, it is hard to believe there isn't more written about Hughes.  Hack's work is very fun and a good introduction to Hughes' life, but it has its critics based on its technical accuracy and its focus on his love life.<br /><br />It's surprising that there isn't yet a definitive biography on Hughes' life and it is really an amazing opportunity for a talented biographer to tackle.  Until such a thing comes along, however, you could do much worse than Hack's book and I recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about an absolutely fascinating character.	2005-04-25

This book reads like a lot of the papers I wrote in college - just enough content to get to the page requirement.  It's really too bad and unexpected, because Bodanis's previous effort at science made understandable for the layman, \\"E=mc2\\" is a fun, focused, and educational read.<br /><br />Electric universe has the makings of a good book, but it seems as if Bodanis realized once he tackled that the topic that it was too big for his planned format so he just chose to touch on a story here and a story there and call it good.  The result is unfocused and doesn't help you to understand electricity or its history too much better than whe you started the book.<br /><br />I don't recommend this one, but don't let that dissaude you from reading \\"e=mc2,\\" which is fantastic.	2005-04-25

Wilbur Smith creates characters (however implausible) that you really come to feel like you know and puts them into situations (again frequently implausible) where you find yourself really routing for them. <br /> <br />It is a testament to the quality of the storytelling in this book that you are willing as the reader to overlook implausibilities and historical innaccuracies because you're enjoying the story so much. <br /> <br />A really enjoyable, well-told story.

For some reason I gave this one a chance, hoping it would be better than the aforementioned \\"Jack.\\"  No such luck. <br /> <br />Welch is an extremely talented leader and businessman, but only a few nuggets of his wisdom fall out of this doorstop of a book. The rest really comes across as Jack writing for Jack and his new wife (For whom he dumped his old wife after praising her effusively in the aforementioned \\"Jack\\").  <br /> <br />There are far better books out there on managment and business. Try \\"Good to Great;\\" it's a whole different format, but you'll get a lot more ideas on making yourself and your company better.	2005-04-15

Rarely can a book balance intelligence and truly unique insight with the ability to be amusing and accessible.  This one does it seemingly without effort and you will absoultely tear through it, feeling wiser when you finish.    I was an economics major in college and was fortunate enough to have a professor who made micro-economics usable, interesting, and fun the way Levitt does in this book.  Levitt analyzes some of our society's really interesting questions like the real reason crime went down in the 90's and the real ability parents have to impact their kids.  His approach and his answers are equally fascinating and you don't need any economics background to understand or enjoy what he's saying.  Instead of the typical \\"follow the money\\" approach, Levitt uses a slightly broader and more micro-economic approach of \\"follow the incentive.\\"  The results will leave you shaking your head in amazement at how obvious they seem now that they've been clearly presented to you.     Levitt has done nothing short of presenting a new and insightful way to look at the world in a manner that is both penetrating and fun.  Quite an accomplishment.  Very highly recommended.	2005-04-15

This is one of those books that will appeal to those  who always wonder why things are the way they are.  Downing introduces his subject by listing all of the explanations he's heard for the existence of Daylight Saving Time and the various dates he's heard it was enacted.  The stories are inconsistent and none of them make much sense.  Dowling's curiosity about what the real story behind Daylight Saving Time was the impetus behind his writing this book and my reading the book.  I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br />Downing begins with the origination of the idea of Daylight Saving in England, takes you through its first implementation in Germany during WWI, quickly followed by Allied nations including the United States.  The story is interesting in that the debate surrounding Daylight Savings has been more or less active from 1918 forward.  The players usually don't come down on the side you've been led to believe by your parents and the media. <br /> <br />This is a great book for those who see what most people perceive as non-noteworthy occurences and feel the need to understand how they came to be.

Winston Churchill was a man who rarely met a topic upon which he didn't harbor a strong opinion that he was willing to share.  The Duke of Marlborough is no different.  Churchill is clearly enamoured with this relative of his and lets it show.  That said, Churchill plainly states that there are two camps on Marlborough and tells the world which camp he falls into.  By doing so, he opens up the reader to get a feel not just for Marlborough and his times, but also for the debate by historians that rages around a polarizing historic figure like Marlborough.  (Sound familiar to anyone else?)  The result is a richly layered work.<br /><br />Winston Churchill viewed history as something that was alive and tangible and his historic writings capture that feeling for readers.  Marlborough's battles - both military and political - come to life in the hands of Churchill.  We get to see one of the great military minds of the 18th century push military science closer and closer to its modern form.  We also see him perform less well on the political front against his foes there.<br /><br />Through the entire book, we get to listen to Winston Churchill in his element, telling us a story about a topic he feels passionately about.  So many of the trials, trevails, and reactions that Churchill ascribes to Marlborough are so obviously parallels to Churchill's life and his reactions that the book has a clear autobiographical tone to it as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended for history buffs and for people who want to understand Churchill more deeply.	2005-04-12

About Great Managing, Great Leading, and Sustained Individual Success	Books	5	50	53	N	Y	An obviously great approach I've never seen used before.	Marcus Buckingham is quickly setting himself apart from the current pack of management and leadership gurus out there.  He isn't yet in the same league as Peter Drucker or Tom Peters, but he's young and he's headed in their direction. <br /> <br />His latest effort, \\"The One Thing\\" joins two instant classics he's already written, \\"First, Break all the Rules\\" and \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths.\\"  This book starts with a premise that sounds obvious once you hear it, but that I've never seen used before.  Buckingham approaches the complex topics of management, leadership and sustained individual success and asks, \\"If you wanted to excel in any of these areas, but could focus in on just one single idea, what would be the most important and effective things you could focus on?\\" <br /> <br />Buckingham then goes on to give you \\"The One Thing\\" in each of those areas.  His points aren't arrived at frivolously.  Buckingham spent years and years working with Gallup, studying and interviewing thousands upon thousands of managers, leaders, and individual contributors, some good and some bad; he knows what separates the wheat from the chaff. <br /> <br />The book is so filled with great insights and \\"Why didn't I think of that\\" moments that my copy is all dog-eared and marked up and some of the things I've learned are going into practice as I type this. <br /> <br />Very highly recommended.	2005-04-07

For me, that conjers up the negative stereotype of the salesman/marketer tricking you into buying something you don't want.  Inside the book, Spoelstra's concept clearly is the polar opposite of that.  He should have called the book, \\"Making Your Product into Something People Really do Want: a Broader Definition of Marketing.\\" <br /> <br />Once you're inside the book, Spoelstra presents a litiny of ideas that are obvious once presented to you, but often seem counter-inuitive without some assistance seeing them.  As a marketer in a larger firm, I've run into a lot of the same resistance as Spoelstra and have found that if you can break down the resistance, his ideas really do work. <br /> <br />Overall this is a practical guide, not just for marketers, but for anyone who runs a business.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-30

I am a big fan of U.S. history and this has been a very popular U.S. history book.  I figured it couldn't miss, but for me, it did. <br /> <br />What Ellis put together here, is basically a greatest hits of the early years of U.S. history.  That is a great premise, but the book frequently loses its focus on the individuals who founded this country and their relationships, and instead heads off into long, sometimes rambling tangents.  In addition, the writing doesn't bring history to life as does the work of historian like David McCullough, William Manchester, and John Steele Gordon. <br /> <br />I think the high ratings on this book say a lot more about the fact that there are a lot of people who want to know more about early American history than it does about the quality of this particular book.  If you would be interested in a better book about U.S. history and are OK with a tilt towards economic history, try Empire of Wealth by John Steele Gordon. <br /> <br />Ellis has done a superb job of choosing his topic and an average job on execution.  Recommended if you really want to learn the subject matter and don't want to read several books in order to do it.	2005-03-09

In 1820, the per capita GDP of the world took off after thousands of years of consistently meager growth.  In this book, Bernstein takes a look at the confluence of circumstances that made the sudden meteoric rise possible. <br /> <br />The topic that Bernstein has chosen is very interesting and his explanation, that there are four preconditions for rapid economic growth, promises a fascinating read.  Unfortunately , as Berstein goes into the preconditions; property rights, capital markets, scientific thought, and good transportation, the writing bogs down a little more than you'd hope into what feels at times like an academic paper. <br /> <br />The book is still very solid and I recommend it for fans of history and economics, but I've seen less promising topics handled with more colurful and page-turning writing.	2005-03-03

I think there is an opportunity for someone to write a modern account of what you would find underground in New York City and how and when it got there.  The concept itself is fascinating that there is a whole separate city below the city that most of us will never see. <br /> <br />That said, Granick's account of the world beneath New York is definitely interesting, but it could go deeper (pun intended) into detail and is really in dire need of an update.   <br /> <br />If the idea of learning about the literal underworld of New York City is interesting to you, this is the best book I've come across.	2005-03-03

As a cyclist and long-time fan of Lance Armstrong, I found it interesting that I finished the book with even more respect for his accomplishments, but feeling like I wouldn't actually enjoy the man if I were to meet him.  I see it as a credit to the writing and to Armstrong's openness in the book that I responded this way.

The result is typically a cautionary tale, and \\"Oryx and Crake\\" is no different, entertainingly warning its readers about the potential dangers of the genetic engineering that we are working on today. <br /> <br />That said, Atwood never forgets that in order to convey her message, she has to keep the pages turning to the end, which she does.  \\"Oryx and Crake\\" begins with a bizarre end and then circles back, gradually revealing the events that brought us to the place we started. <br /> <br />Very good for fans of science fiction and for those who enjoy different authors' views of possible futures.	2005-02-22

Peter Drucker is the father of modern management theory and has never been equaled or surpassed in terms of his theories or their usability.  The problem with Drucker is that over the course of sixty highly productive years, he's put out more books than it is practical for almost anyone to read. This book addresses that issue for those of us who would like the best parts in one book. <br /> <br />The mark of the finest minds is the ability to clearly and simply articulate ideas that make you wonder \\"why didn't I think of that?\\"  Once stated, Drucker's ideas are so obvious, but I almost never find any that I came up with on my own and have never put the ideas into words as concisely as he does time after time. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for anyone interested in running a better business.  My copy is dog-eared, underlined, marked-up and otherwise worn.	2005-02-22

McCullough's choice of Truman as his subject was inspired.  In writing a chronical of the man's life, he masterfully traces the United States' often reluctant emergence onto the world stage as a superpower.  Harry S. Truman and the United States both begin this tale with no idea of the prominence that is in store for them.  Both struggle with their acceptance of what their new roles require of them.  Finally, both rise to the occasion and surpass expectations in their given role.   <br /> <br />The book features McCullough's trademark, history written in prose that makes it as engaging as fiction.  Anyone interested in biography or in the history of the United States should invest the time in this one.  At 1,100 pages, it will take time, but it never feels long or tedious.  Highly recommended.	2005-02-15

Few authors have ever used words or created characters with the skill of Charles Dickens.  There is an inherent wit in almost every sentence and phrase that constantly give two and three layers of meaning to his words.  That said, the story of \\"Oliver Twist\\" feels a bit more contrived than some of his other work.  All of Dickens' writing features charicatures of people, places, and situations in order to emphasize their meanings, but \\"Oliver Twist\\" has a tendency to lean on improbability than some of Dickens' other work.<br /><br />A great work and a great look at society and those who inhabit it, but start with \\"Tale of Two Cities.\\"	2005-02-15

The good news for Dan Brown is that he showed distinct improvement from this novel to \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"  \\"Angels and Demons\\" shares a lot of characteristics with Brown's mega-selling follow-up, but it's missing some things too.  This novel tells an engrossing story about the Catholic church in a desperate hour, locked in a battle with an ancient (and assumed defunct) foe.  The story follows Brown's hero, Robert Langdon, around Rome as he races the clock to unravel a mystery before time runs out.<br /><br />So far, so good, and the story is imaginitive and laced with enough quasi-factual tidbits to make it really fun.  The problems show up as the book reaches its climax and throws in two or three plot elements that really stretch the reader's ability to suspend disbelief for the sake of the story.<br /><br />There's a reason Brown caught fire with the DaVinci code and not this book, but this one is still worth reading if you want more of what you found in \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"  If you haven't read that book, start there first.	2005-02-15

This book is worth reading just to get a sense of the way the American public views business today. The stories of businesses told in this book are one-sided and even irrational, but without a doubt, they reflect the way American business is seen by the public right now. <br /> <br />The problem with the book is that it offers very few ideas on how a business can successfully navigate today's minefield of public perception. As a reader hoping to come away with ideas on how to nurture the public's perception of my business, I instead finished the book feeling that businesses are largely at the mercy of dumb luck and circumstance when it comes to perception. Further, the author admits that businesses are in a \\"damned if you do, damned if you don't\\" situation when attempting to let the public know about any acts of goodwill. <br /> <br />This book is well-timed to take advantage of today's anti-business climate, but not of much help for those seeking to find their way through it.	2005-02-10

Walton does a nice job of telling a clear, concise story about how he built the business of Wal Mart.  It's very enlightening to hear him admit with pride that he invented very few of the ideas that made the store such a success, instead borrowing the best ideas from every store he visited (and he visited a lot).   <br /> <br />Secondly, this book contains a valuable example of how capitalism forces the evolution - for better or worse - of industries.  Walton takes the reader from the days of the small-town five and dime all the way through the mega Wal Marts of today.  It's a valuable read for anyone interested in business. <br /> <br />Third, reading \\"Made in America\\" provides the reader with some important context for considering all of the attacks on Wal Mart in the popular press.  You get to see that Wal Mart was built with really good intentions and that even though not everything born of Wal Mart's rise to dominance is an unmitigated good, it has done a lot of positive things for American consumers.  That's really valuable because Wal Mart has become a bit of an unequivocal evil in the modern press and that simply isn't an even-handed treatment of the subject. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for those who would like to understand the motivations behind Wal Mart being what it is today and a great business story to boot.	2005-02-10

The anecdotes in the book are very well written which keeps you turning the pages and also gives you that fun sense that you are reading something that not everyone knows about.  You get a flavor for how close, frequent and dangerous the contact between the US and USSR was despite the fact that we were never technically at war with one another.  <br /> <br />A lot of fun to read if you like espionage or Navy stories.  In addition you learn something about the history of the Cold War.  Well worth the time.	2005-02-10

I read this book after seeing Robert Redford's movie of the same name.  Interestingly, Redford both added to, and took away from, the book in order to arrive at the story for his movie. <br /> <br />The book is intended to be a modern version of the Bhagavad Gita, told using golf as a metaphor rather than war.  It is an ambitious effort by Pressfield that comes across far darker and deeper than the movie.  Redford, on the other hand, focuses his movie on portions of the book and gives it a lighter feeling, making it a more clear-cut tale of redemption. <br /> <br />Both are very good, but they are also very different.  I highly recommend the book even if you've already seen the movie - you'll only recognize a little of what's here.	2005-02-10

It's not often that an author comes along with a first book that just blows you away.  \\"Peace Like a River\\" represents one of those rare instances.   <br /> <br />Tthe book is filled with some of the best dialogue I've ever read.  It manages to be both realistic and compelling at the same time, drawing you into the story and bringing you closer to the characters.  The book approaches the miraculous with such care and well-crafted writing that it challenges your pre-conceptions about believing in miracles. <br /> <br />A great, great book; on par with \\"Middlesex\\" and \\"Life of Pi.\\"  If you've read those and enjoyed them, you will enjoy this modern classic.	2005-02-09

Any time you pick up a book with a title like \\"Jack: Straight from the Gut\\" you should know you are getting yourself into an exercise in self-congratulation.  References to yourself by first name alone with a glib sub-title like \\"Straight from the Gut\\" are not good signs.  For some reason I missed those signs in the title, but by the end of the book I understood it in spades. <br /> <br />Welch is an extremely talented leader and businessman, but only a few nuggets of his wisdom fall out of this doorstop of a book.  The rest really comes across as Jack writing for Jack.  It's also distracting to read books (like Lance Armstrong's \\"It's not about the Bike\\") in which the author praises their spouse as God's greatest gift to them when you, the reader, know that they've since been shown to be cheating on them or to have left them for someone flashier. <br /> <br />Better books out there on managment and business.  Try \\"Good to Great;\\" it's a whole different format, but you'll get a lot more ideas on making yourself and your company better.	2005-02-09

In addition to really painting a colorful picture of Roosevelt, Morris does a great job of capturing the times in which Roosevelt lived, making the book a great primer on America and the world at the turn of the last century. <br /> <br />Roosevelt did a nice job of separating what the public wanted from what would do it the most good.  He was a long-term thinker and a person who could weigh both sides of an issue and find the solution that took both sides into account (often with the end result of making everyone mad at him rather than just one side.)  Rooseevelt negotiated treaties and intitiated projects (like the Panama Canal) that changed the direction of world history. <br /> <br />Fantastic book for fans of history and biography.	2005-02-04

This book is simply not worthy of the acclaim it has received.  It probably sells well because it is such a short and easy read, but the information in the book is obvious, oversimplistic, and not useful if you are a manager looking for better performance from your team.   <br /> <br />If you are looking for a book that will help you as a manager to get more out of your workers, try \\"First, Break all the Rules\\" by Marcus Buckingham.

The book includes the password to a website that allows you to take a clever little test that tells you your five primary strengths (out of 25 or so) or those of your subordinates if they take the test. <br /> <br />In reading the book, you learn about the different attributes, what work best fits the various skill sets and how best to manage people with the various characteristics.  This really is a very useful book, but Buckingham's first book was so strong that this one suffered a little bit by comparison.	2005-02-04

The researchers and author behind this much-needed book started with a simple question: What do the world's best managers do differently from all other managers?  And approached the question in a scientific manner, first doing research to determine who the best managers in the world were, and then examining their abilities and actions from every angle (along with the abilities and actions of average managers) to see what set them apart. <br /> <br />The result is deceptively simple and decidedly powerful; focus on the strengths of those who work for you.  It obviously gets more involved than that and explains how to deal with the weaknesses of your reports, but I've put these principles into action in my business and have gotten measurable results. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for any manager.  It helped me in a very real, measurable way.	2005-02-04

I probably punctuated my title incorrectly, and if I remembered everything I read in this book, I probably would have gotten it right.  That is the basis of this book.  The author has taken her self-admittedly violent reaction to the degradation of punctuation standards throughout the English-speaking world and compiled her frustrations into a book.  Based on the sales figures, she has a lot of company in her frustration. <br /> <br />While Truss's writing is quite witty for a book about punctuation, it's still a book about punctuation.  Her explanations on how to properly use different punctuation marks and in which circumstances are clear and concise and she has some amusing anecdotes about dire consequences attributable to poor punctuation.  That said, the book gets a bit long-winded in some of her rants (which are fun and colorful when she keeps them short) and that keeps the book at four stars rather than five. <br /> <br />Any punctuation fanatic frustrated with poor punctuation in public will find a kindred spirit in Ms. Truss and will enjoy this book.	2005-02-03

If you are a fan of Star Trek, you likely have enough of an interest in science and physics to enjoy this read.  The book's concept is simple enough, that physicists, as a group, have somewhat of an obsesive-compulsive disorder over anaylyzing the scientific feasability behind the fictional events on the show.  Krauss, being a physicist afflicted with Star Trek OCD, decided that writing a book on the subject might be good therapy. <br /> <br />Regardless of whether the treatment worked for Krauss, it works for readers.  The book is always entertaining, teaches a surprising amount of physics along the way and introduces the reader to some novel problem-solving approaches.  Fans of Star Trek will also get an appreciation for just how large an effort the show's creators put into scientific plausibility, even if they occasionally bend the laws of physics to enhance the plot. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for fans of physics and Star Trek.	2005-01-31

There are a couple things that come across loud and clear: first, these venture capitalists were not blind to the bubble that was forming; second, if they wanted to stay alive and relevant in their field, they needed to keep financing new companies and unwillingly participate in furthering the bubble. <br /> <br />The story is well-told and gives you an insider's view of how at least one venture capital firm makes the decision of who gets funding and who doesn't.

The rules themselves are reasonably well written, but more than anything else, you just learn about how to improve your deal-making abilities by just reading about one deal after another in such close succession.  Eventually, you get a foundation of deal-making knowledge through osmosis. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book as a tool for anyone who wants more of a foundation of knowledge to improve their deal-making skills.	2005-01-25

Gladwell uses well-chosen stories to illustrate each of the points he makes and has a gift for telling the stories in a way that flows and keeps you interested.  That is the great news about this book.    Unlike \\"The Tipping Point,\\" however, \\"Blink\\" doesn't arrive at a coherent and usable conclusion.  It starts with the promising premise about the power of first impressions and gets you interested to learn how you might be able to make first impressions - both your own and others' - work better for you. It seems a very reasonable expectation if you've read \\"Tipping Point.\\"  Unfortunately, \\"Blink\\" breaks down into an ambiguous \\"sometimes first imprssions help, sometimes they hurt\\" conclusion that leaves you underwhelmed.    If you haven't read \\"Tipping Point,\\" go there first.  If you have and you really liked it, you will get more of the great writing and story-telling from this book, but not the useful conclusion.	2005-01-25

It accomplishes the expected by displaying day-to-day life on a US submarine in WWII, but it does more by really capturing the voice of an innocent young man who still has a lot to learn about the world. <br /> <br />Calvert went on to quite a distinguished career in the Navy, but this book never hints at that, instead it paints a portrait of a very specific period of time in the author's life and doesn't bog the reader down with too much 20/20 hindsight and reflections, instead relaying the feeling of being in your early 20s and being involved in one of the highest-stakes contests ever fought in human history. <br /> <br />If you like memoirs, history, or WWII, this is a very well-told story that will appeal to you.	2005-01-25

It has one instance after another of \\"a-ha\\" moments where the light goes on in your head as to why things in our industry are the way they are.  Nocera does a great job of tracing each of the innovations that made Wall Street more and more accessible to the average American, benefiting the investor and the companies that got financing. <br /> <br />The other very instructive point this book makes is about the mind, and methodology of the people who drive innovations.  For anyone looking to build the better mousetrap, here is a book about person after person who did exactly that in the arena of personal finance. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-01-25

David McCullough is a master of picking a great historical story and telling it an engaging, page-turning manner.  In the process, he wraps in the surrounding personalities and sub-plots that define  the age in which the story takes place. <br /> <br />In reading \\"Path Between the Seas\\" you get the sense of how different life was when travelling from New York to California was a three month affair which could be cut to six weeks by risking disease and death by cutting across the isthmus of Panama.  The engineering feat undertaken to change that situation was the largest undertaken in the history of man.  Anyone who enjoys history and/or engineering will find this one to be fascinating. <br /> <br />A great story, well-told.  Highly recommended.	2005-01-24

JP Morgan set much of modern American finance on its axis and started it turning.  In his day, he was a private citizen who acted as the central banker in the largest economy in the world.  Not once, but twice, was JP Morgan alone able to corral market-wide panics that not even the US government could halt.  Morgan acted as purchasing agent for Great Britain as it stood alone against Germany before the US entered WWII.  Morgan was truly a man larger than those the system allows to exist today. <br /> <br />This book also shows how and why efforts were made, many undertaken to limit Morgan, to change the system so that one person couldn't wield the power that Morgan plyed in his day. <br /> <br />Chernow captures the entire tale of Morgan's life and the era in which he lived in an easy-to-read style that maintains a good pace. <br /> <br />A great book for lovers of history, biography, or finance.  Highly recommended.	2005-01-24

Most books about politics are so one-sided that they don't tend to present a realistic view of the world.  I read this book on the recommendation of a friend who is fairly level-headed and I really enjoyed the perspective D'Souza shares. <br /> <br />D'Souza begins the book with a fairly deep look at what he defines as the three \\"schools\\" of hating America that are most prevalent in the world and acknowledges the credible points in each one of the arguments.  He spends the rest of the book systematically explaining why he believes that America offers something wonderful and unique in the world. <br /> <br />I enjoyed his arguments because he stuck to logical paths which a reasonable person could follow from one point to the next.  It isn't that there aren't counter-arguments to D'Souza's points, but that they warrant counter points because they maintain coherence and logic where so much political rhetoric just leans on the pre-existing agreement of its audience. <br /> <br />Whether you agree or disagree with D'Souza's conclusions on America, I believe this book offers a tight logical explanation of what you are arguing for or against.	2005-01-20

Collins takes a highly logical approach to his research on how good companies become great companies.  He starts by finding companies hat have actually made the leap, taking off in a way that dramatically outpaces the market and their respective industry.  After isolating these companies, Collins does in-depth research to find out what they have in common with each other, but not with more average firms. <br /> <br />The result of Collins' work are principles that can and do work.  They are not overnight cures and they are not always easy to implement, but who said that becoming great would be easy? <br /> <br />For any manager or leader of an organization, business or otherwise, interested in taking their organization to a whole new level this is mandatory reading.	2005-01-19

We have several down-and-out people and a down-and-out horse coming together and finding their strengths with one another to conquer long odds after an uphill struggle complete with devastating setbacks.  You couldn't ask for much more in a fictional script and to get it in real life and then have the story told as well as Hillenbrand tells it is a real treat.	2005-01-19

As might be expected with two individuals who had countries to lead in times of extreme peril, these men were pulled in many different directions, not always coinciding with one another.  Yet the close personal bond between these two men was instrumental in preserving the freedom we enjoy today.<br /><br />Like a good biography, this book shows the reader the men behind the nearly mythic names and you find flawed individuals with amzing traits that allowed them to accomplish something that almost nobody else could.  What is perhaps most engaging about this book is learning how both of these men were susceptible to the same personal, emotional responses to slights and breaches of trust that any of us would be.<br /><br />Any WWII or history fan will enjoy this one.	2005-01-19

The book tells the story of how many US soldiers ended up in the Bataan Death March and their experiences during and after that trail, as well as their eventual rescue. <br /> <br />For those of us who live in an era of comfort unlike any known before our time, it's intersting and important to glimpse into the lives of people who endured things that almost seem surreal to us now.  The description of arbitrary brutality really makes you appreciate the perils endured by those who came before us for our sake. <br /> <br />Sides tells the story gracefully and paces the story steadily.  Highly recommended for history buffs, anyone who wants to understand the meaning behing the Bataan Death March, or who values the sacrifices made by others for us.	2005-01-19

Unfortunately, it feels as if there was so much satisfaction about capturing the voice of the narrator that putting an equal effort into the plot was deemed unnecessary.  There this book falls short of the claims of greatness that so many people lavish on it.    It is understandable that for the autistic protagonist of this story, the accomplishment of some outwardly pedestrian activities would be great triumphs.  That doesn't excuse the writing from its obligation to convey that sense of accomplishment to the reader.  That doesn't happen here; you are left to assume that something big has been accomplished.    Can't say enough good things about the voice in which this story is told, but if you get through 100 pages and wonder where the plot is, you will still be wondering when you finish the book.  Something impressive has been accomplished in the writing of this book, but it lacks basic elements of plot that keep a reader moving through the story and that isn't a tiny flaw.	2005-01-19

Gladwell avoids that trap in \\"The Tipping Point\\" by following his fascinating idea with storytelling and examples that make this as much of a page-turner as a lot of fiction novels. <br /> <br />Gladwell describes the means by which concepts catch fire in a society and brings them to life with interesting and detailed examples that really capture your imagination and get you thinking about the possibilities inherent in the concept of the tipping point. <br /> <br />Whether you are looking for a way to help your business or just enjoy a well-told story and the nuances of how societies function, this is an educational and fun book. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-01-19

This book's characters are no different.  You come to care for some, hate others, and have mixed feelings about many.  I literally performed a small fist-pump at one point in this book after an event that I felt necessary for my own vindication.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this book has been read consistently since its writing.

This book tells the story of the laying of that cable and at the same time paints a portrait of Cyrus Field, the entreprenuer who laid the cable, and a period of time when so much about life was changing for inhabitants of the western world.  Perhaps no other invention shrunk the world as quickly and as meaningfully as the trans-Atlantic cable. <br /> <br />John Steele Gordon always manages to imbue his writing of history with color and character that draws the reader into the story and keeps the pages turning quickly and easily; \\"Thread Across the Ocean\\" is no exception.  This is a book for anyone who enjoys well-written history.	2005-01-19

Read this book and enjoy finding out. <br /> <br />Toward the beginning of \\"Bringing Down the House\\" the author recounts his skepticism when told by a fellow party-goer that he has the story for his next book.  His skepticism, and any the reader might have, fade quickly when the story begins to be told.  While the writing has some quirks - a metal detector as the modern-day equivelant of Stonehenge? - it moves the story along at a consistent pace while giving you a look inside the lives of a sophisticated group of professional blackjack players who take on a system that does not take kindly to being beaten.  The result is a fun, very quick read that tackles a fairly novel topic. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-01-18

Devil in the White City actually tells not one, but two interesting, undertold stories that coincided with one another toward the end of the 19th century in Chicago.  The first is the highly disturbing story of a serial killer and the second is the story of the planning and execution of the 1896 World Fair.  The stories are told in alternating chapters of the book.  Surprisingly, the whole thing works very nicely. <br /> <br />Larson's writing is very detailed, but reads almost like fiction.  Even better, Larson really captures the sense of unlimited possibilities that was so pervasive around the turn of the century.  The 1896 World Fair had a very tough act to follow after the Paris Fair of 1892 that featured a brand-new structure called the Eiffel Tower.  The Chicago exposition got the job done and introduced so many things we take for granted today that its story keeps you turning pages nearly as quickly as the tale of murder and deceipt with which it is interspersed. <br /> <br />Give this one a read.	2005-01-18

This is certainly not a paint-by-numbers guide to business, but if you are striving to do something truly different and better with your business, \\"Orbiting the Giant Hairball\\" may provide an approach that can help you. <br /> <br />As an aside, the book itself is a piece of art - I've never seen another like it.

Heck yeah.  Is it a less-than-completely accurate portrayal of the hitory of Alexander?  Pressfield admits as much in his foreward.  But what Pressfield does well here is give us a character-driven telling of the story of Alexander's development as a leader before and during his campaign through Asia.  You have to accept historical fiction for what it is: fiction.  If you want unadulturated history, read non-fiction, but it won't move along the way this fictionalized account does. <br /> <br />If you have never read Pressfield, his best book by a wide margin (in my mind) is still \\"Gates of Fire,\\" so it makes sense to start there, but \\"Virtues of War\\" should definitely be on the shopping list for anyone who enjoys historical fiction.	2005-01-18

At its most basic, it is a book about a squadron of American WWII bomber pilots who fly over Axis territory out of their base in Italy late in the war.  More specifically, it is about one captain who has become all crossed up with the absurdity of the war. <br /> <br />In the end, it struck me as being a book about being able to see the world from fresh perspectives, even when you think you already are.  The ending of the book leaves you feeling strangely excited about the unseen possibilities in life. <br /> <br />A must-read for anyone who enjoys fiction that delves into the philosophical.	2005-01-18

I think it's the language used that held me up slightly.  But once I got into it I barely put it down.  The book tells the true story of 300 Spartans warriors who gather a patchwork of Greek soldiers and hold off an army of nearly a million Persian soldiers.      The key to the story's quality is the excellent character development by Pressfield.  As a reader, you really become involved with the characters and care about their fate.  In addition, there are many lessons about leadership strewn throughout the story and the battle scenes place you right in the action.  The result is a book that is nearly impossible to put down that leaves you sorry it's over.    A must read.	2005-01-18

But what a payoff!  In addition to having a really thick book to put on your shelf to impress your friends, this is one of the greatest biographies over written.    Caro has chosen a truly unique character to profile.  Robert Moses is unlike any other person I've encountered in my reading.  The man backed down the Governor of New York and the President of the United States from a non-elected position in New York City government.  In addition, Moses dominated every mayor of New York and the politics of the city itself for almost 40 years.  No wonder the book is so long.    In addition, the book can't help but be a biography of modern New York City.  So much of the city bears the fingerprints of Robert Moses that learning about the man necessarily teaches you a lot about how the city became what it is today.    A must-read for fans of biography, stories of power, and New York City.	2005-01-14

Churchill got around plenty before settling down in Parliament and \\"Visions of Glory\\" covers that portion of Churchill's life.    This book takes an exciting life and brings you into it.  As good as biography gets.	2005-01-14

This book does more than any other to demonstrate what set Churchill apart from others in this monumental task.   <br /> <br />In covering Churchill's years of political exhile between WWI and WWII, Manchester captures the man who was willing to assess the world order for himself and stand completely alone with every force imaginable opposing him.  In the end, he was right and the world was wrong.  This book captures that wonderfully.	2005-01-14
US	46089061	RIS759XTP0WZB	0767908171	997649583	A Short History of Nearly Everything	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Filled with "I didn't know that!" moments.	This is just a fun book to read if you have any interest in science and the world around us. <br /> <br />Bryson claims he got the idea for this book while flying over an ocean and thinking, \\"I should know know more about the world and what makes it tick\\" or something to that end.  However he got the idea, the result is a solid book.  Short History breaks down into the scientific history of the Universe, the Earth, and Humans.  Almost every page teaches you something fascinating and there is an underlying message about how the truth, when new, will be fought vigorously almost without fail. <br /> <br />The whole thing is written in a witty style that keeps you turning the pages.	2005-01-13
US	46089061	R2XIA761K484CL	1594200092	686377339	Alexander Hamilton	Books	4	6	9	N	Y	A complex man with great foresight - great writing.	Ron Chernow presents a highly readable account of the life of a man who, despite living 200 years ago, still has a very tangible positive impact on our daily lives today.  In his telling of Hamilton's story, Chernow has written a book that serves a dual purpose: it serves as an excellent historical biography that tells the story of a man and his time, at the same time, it helps the modern reader to understand the basic tenets of our fiscal and economic system in the United States.      Alexander Hamilton is a fascinating and complesx character and Chernow's writing keeps you moving through the book at a good pace right through the epilogue.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys history or biography.	2005-01-13
US	46089061	RVX43DWWSG9OK	0743223136	747139631	John Adams	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	Typical of McCullough - Rock Solid	McCullough has a gift.  He has an ability to pick and interesting person and/or story and use it as the core of an engaging account of a place and time.  John Adams is no different.  McCullough tells the story of Adams, and in the telling captures for the reader just how fragile and uncertain a time the beginning of the United States was.  What now seems a foregone conclusion was anything but at the time.  The book tells a great story about a great man, but it also makes you appreciate the battle that the founding fathers fought to see our country through a veritable minefield on its way to a solid footing.	2005-01-13
US	46089061	R1VZLT9LPJIRB3	0425170411	281434626	Lindbergh	Books	5	0	0	N	N	One of the best biographies I've ever read.	This book has truly got it all.  The definitive biography on Lindbergh, it begins with a fascinating subject in Charles Lindbergh himself.  The man was a true enigma, a private person who became the most famous human up to his time.  Lindbergh spent his life seeking something that he never quite seemed to find.  The story also benefits by capturing an era when so much of life was in flux for so many.<br /><br />A great story about a fascinating character, well-written and well-constructed.  A must-read for biography and history buffs or for anyone interested in knowing more about Lindbergh.	2005-01-13

The idea that random groups of people have an incredible collective wisdom that can be tapped into under the right conditions is truly interesting.  Surowiecki then goes on to get the second piece of the puzzle right - he tells a good story.  His real-world examples of the wisdom of crowds in action are engaging and really capture your imagination and make you consider the power and possibilities of the wisdom of crowds -- which is where this book falls a little short of five stars. <br /> <br />If this book only closed by suggesting a practical approach to implementing the wisdom of crowds in new and different situations, helping readers tap into the power of the concept, this would be a five star book.  It falls slightly short but is still absolutely worth the read.	2005-01-13

What a great story about knowing your weaknesses.  Some people will characterize this as a story of arrogance and greed, but to me, that misses the point.  Not that these guys weren't arrogant and greedy - they were - but that isn't what got them into trouble.  Instead, they made a mistake that can be made by anybody at any time, they failed to recognize and deal with their weaknesses. <br /> <br />It is the universal nature of that mistake tat makes this book so fascinating to me.  If the rocket scientists of Long-Term Capital Management with all of their genius for risk-assessment can miss this pitfall, then so can anybody.  Besides, it's a lot easier and more fun to learn about a mistake you can avoid by reading about somebody else making that mistake and nearly dragging down the whole world's financial markets in the process.	2005-01-13

If not, this is a great place to start. <br /> <br />The Great Bridge tells the story of the building of the Brooklyn Bridge.  As McCullough always does, he starts with a story about people, in this case, the Roebling's who designed and built the bridge.  Into that story McCullough seamlessly weaves a portrait of life and politics in New York in the 1870s and 1880s and the engineering and construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. <br /> <br />It is a completely readable story that leaves you with a real appreciation for what it was like to live at a time when everything seemed to be changing and it felt like man and technology could conquer all. <br /> <br />A great read.	2005-01-13
US	46089061	R3T1QXJEEJZAO0	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Entertains you for a long time, then makes you think.	When an author can take an improbably story and make a skeptical reader suspend his disbelief, he's accomplished something.  When the author then takes that very fact and uses it for his own purposes at the end of the story, he's done something really special.    This is a special book.  It is an always-entertaining story of a young Indian boy set adrift on a lifeboat in the Pacific with a Bengal Tiger (why not?).  Beyond being a survival story, it is a story of maintaining hope, and in the end, a story about how you, the reader, view the world.    Not to be missed.	2005-01-13

Here's a book that follows three generations of a Greek, then Greek-American, family from the old country to Detroit and is narrated by a hermaphrodite from the third generation of the family.  Sound weird?  It is, but only in good ways.<br /><br />In the end, this is a story driven by colorful, believable characters that you really end up caring for.  Through their story, you witness the process of coming to America and making a life.<br /><br />If you like stories that are just slightly off-center, look no further.	2005-01-13

Empire of Wealth covers   the history of the economy of the United States from Jamestown through today and does so in an insight-filled, page-turning manner.  Even as a fairly avid reader of economics and history, I found myself learning something about why our country is the way it is on almost every page in this book. <br /> <br />A great story of people, culture, technology, money, and a country - this book truly deserves its high rating.	2005-01-13

All right, I like classic literature as much as the next guy, so I thought this would be an interesting book to read. <br /> <br />Turns out, not for me, and maybe not for you. <br /> <br />If you are a hard-core student of english literature with a substantial pre-existing background, I could see this being an engaging book.  However, if you, like me, enjoy reading classic literature and are just looking for something to point you in a good direction and give you a better appreciation of what you are reading, this is not it.  I suffered through the minutiae and (to me) incomprehensible analogies only because I have a psychological barrier around stopping a book once I've started, but I warn off all but the most ardent students of literature.   <br /> <br />To those of you with the education and knowledge to appreciate this book, you have my admiration and you can also have my copy.	2005-01-13

Ever wonder how and why we ended up speaking the way we do?  Here are your answers. <br /> <br />Bryson addresses which people and which languages came together to form the basis of the English we speak today.  He lays out the types of words that originate with the various groups and examines the process of word creation and the migration of words and pronuciation. <br /> <br />For anyone who likes language and would enjoy knowing more about how and when English came to this point, this is a good - and fun - read.	2005-01-13

All that's left is a half-interesting, if disturbing, glimpse into the mindset of the sixties and an imaginative, but underdeveloped, science fiction story.<br />There are some timeless lessons here about being an authentic person, committing to one another, and being open to the views of others.  The power of those lessons, however, is vastly diminished by their placement next to non-titanic philosophical issues like the value of nakedness and bathing and sleeping with as many as you can in the name of love (but only if they are your water brother).<br />Must admit that it is fun to see what we thought high-tech would be in the future when viewed from the 60's.  It makes you wonder what we'll come up with in the future that we haven't envisioned yet.	2003-09-12
