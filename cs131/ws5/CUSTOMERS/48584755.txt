I'm not normally a chick lit fan, but this book opened me up to the fact that I can love chick lit. Jennifer Weiner shines <br />with a well-developed, smart, humorous main character (Cannie) and lots of heart (reminds me of Helen Fielding). Cannie is an <br />intelligent (and overweight) woman who writes for a large <br />Philadelphia newspaper...and as most chick lit goes she's obsessed with her weight and a particular man, and she's got lots of life struggles to overcome. I usually don't like this \\"formula\\" but it was likeable in this book and completely unformula-like. I laughed out loud with this <br />book, got misty-eyed a couple of times, and generally couldn't pry the book from my fingers most of the time I was reading it. I'm rating this one a 5/5 for the pure enjoyment of it and the fact that it kept me up until 1am when I had an early class to teach. Sometimes books come along at just the right time in our lives, and this one hit the mark perfectly for me. <br />	2005-03-08

A friend recommended that I read Bet Me because I reminded her of the main character, so I took a leap and loved this book. The main character, Min, was a feisty, fun character with a biting wit. I also enjoyed the cast of peripheral characters...Min's friends and those of her unlikely love interest, Cal. Outlandish happenings abound in this book, but that was part of the fun. Above all, Crusie writes great sexual tension that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book. I will definitely pick up more Crusie in the future.	2005-03-07

I read Jane Eyre recently, so I had to see what all the fuss was about in regards to The Eyre Affair. My online book discussion groups have been buzzing about it for ages, and I finally understand all the buzz! <br />Jasper Fforde has written a laugh-out-loud romp through an alternative Britain where fanatical groups form around various writers such as Milton, Bacon, and Shakespeare, time travel is possible, and the extinct Dodo bird is the pet of choice. Thursday Next is our female hero whose job it is to track and destroy the evil Acheron Hades before he murders some of literature's most valued characters.<br />Fforde works in a lot of sly jokes through unusual names (Braxton Hicks, Millon da Floss), and the abundant literary allusions are enough to delight any book lover. Even if you haven't read all of the works cited in the book (Richard III, Jane Eyre, Martin Chuzzlewit to name a few) there's still plenty for you to enjoy. Fforde has written a delightful mystery for everyone.	2004-06-11

I found many parts touching, and I enjoyed the insight into the lives of the students with whom Nafisi met on a weekly basis to discuss controversial literature. Nafisi is a very interesting person and an impeccable writer. My only criticism (and it's more a matter of personal taste than anything)....I got very bogged down in the middle. I wanted to learn more about Nafisi's students. I assumed that they would be the main focus of the book from reading the blurb on the cover. The first and last sections focused mostly on the women's gatherings, but the middle sections focused mostly on the war situation in Iran. Not that that particular part wasn't interesting (in fact it was absolutely necessary to illustrate the state of the Islamic Republic), but I just found myself more captivated by the struggles and opinions of the women. I greatly enjoyed reading the insight into some of my favorite novels including The Great Gatsby and Pride and Prejudice. I also added plenty of works to my growing wishlist based on the commentary between Nafisi and her students.	2004-01-10

What can be said about Harry Potter that hasn't been said in a review before? Probably nothing, but here it goes, anyway....<br />I found this book just as delightful as the first four. Order of the Phoenix takes on an expectedly darker tone as it follows Harry through physical, mental, and emotional maturity. Many have asked why Rowling feels the need to darken the books as they progress, but like life in general, with the continual loss of innocence come the harsh realities of life. With a dark tone Rowling balances out unpleasantries with great lessons on life. Harry continually stands up for his beliefs (one of the hardest lessons to learn in life), the characters are three-dimensional...never being portrayed as completely good or completely bad, and there are great statements on responsibility and the consequences of one's actions (the responsibility theme seeps into all the characters....not just Harry). <br />As usual Rowling's writing style is superb. She creates wonderfully rich visuals, and I found myself always equipped with the details I needed to clearly picture every scene in the book. Most importantly...it's a fun book! Totally engrossing and highly recommended.	2003-07-01

How could an author really make being lost at sea with a tiger interesting for 300-some-odd pages? Well, I admit it when I'm wrong...this book managed to be amazing. <br />Pi Patel is an old soul in a young body...a sensitive young man who prescribes to all varieties of religion, and grows up among the animals in the Pondicherry zoo where his father oversees things. While on the way to Canada, the ship carrying Pi, his family, and some of the zoo animals sinks and Pi is left with a lifeboat full of violent creatures, and he must survive the fray. <br />Life of Pi is a voyage filled with periods of turmoil and serenity. Pi must physically survive, glean the will and tools to survive from his limited surroundings, grapple with his spirituality, grief, and loneliness, and learn to deal with a deadly tiger in a very limited amount of territory. I found the whole book enthralling, especially the ways in which Pi met his needs for food, water, shelter, and dealt with a variety of other problems. There's even a bit of a twist at the end that I found heartbreaking, frustrating, interesting, and ultimately very clever. The book makes you question what is real and unreal and what's worth putting faith in. <br />The only warning I have for readers: lots of animal violence. With animals in a lifeboat there's bound to be some bloodshed.	2003-06-12

I'd heard raves about Tuesdays with Morrie, so I was ready for a let down (due to overhype), but to my great surprise this book enchanted me. Mitch Albom was wrapped up in material things and career concerns until he was reunited with his dying professor. Albom's time with Morrie Schwartz, before his death, is chronicled in this charming little book. The lessons might seem clich√© or maudlin in the hands of another writer, but because Albom had such a close relationship with Morrie the professor's personality really comes through in the book. What might've been sappy otherwise comes through with heartfelt meaning and the sincerity with which it was so lovingly passed on to Albom as he talked with his friend in his dying days. This book is not all heavy and filled with seriousness. There's a great deal of humor in Morrie's attitude, lessons, and stories and I found myself laughing out loud several times. <br />In addition to the great story, I was also impressed with the layout of the book. Albom intermingles old memories from his college days in Morrie's classes among the short chapters dealing with specific life lessons like aging, love, and death. This method of layout made for an engrossing, and very fast-moving read. I blew through the book in only a few hours and was completely satisfied with its well roundedness. There was laughter as well as tears, and I came away from the book feeling enriched.	2003-06-12

I'd been told that this book was similar to The Catcher in the Rye, and it is on some levels. It's structured as a series of letters from the main character (Charlie) to an unknown recipient. Charlie is a delightful main character...introspective, sensitive, insightful, and never angsty (this is the big difference from Catcher). Chbosky tackles pretty much every issue that a teen could possibly face...drugs, alcohol, love, loss, you name it. While I didn't find it to be the most original book, I loved the writing style and there were a ton of great quotes. As a plus for book lovers Charlie reads a good number of well-loved classics and gives his opinions on them as he relates them to his life. Some of the titles include The Fountainhead, The Catcher in the Rye, The Stranger, The Great Gatsby, and To Kill a Mockingbird. Overall very touching and engrossing.	2003-01-09

After picking up Garner's Politically Correct Bedtime Stories I rushed out to pick up PC Holiday Stories just in time for Christmas. I have to say that the majority of the book is just as delightful as the first. This volume consists of five stories: 'Twas the Night Before Solstice, Frosty the Persun of Snow, The Nutcracker, Rudolph the Nasally Empowered Reindeer, and A Christmas Carol. In my opinion, `Twas the Night Before Solstice was the best of the stories. Garner gives us an incredibly hilarious rendition of The Night Before Christmas including a dreams of lentils and warm whole grain breads (instead of the traditional sugarplums), trees dressed \\"like a seasonal strumpet\\", and, in an act of great Christmas good-doing, the kids liberate Santa's reindeer. The only bad part about the book, and it's hard to even call it bad, is the length of A Christmas Carol. Garner's stories are packed with puns and satire, so anything over 10 or 15 pages is a bit much...and A Christmas Carol is somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 pages. That said, if you're in the mood for an off-beat Christmas treat I urge you to pick up this book. It's a quick read and full of laughs.	2002-12-19

While I would've loved to LOVE this book...I just couldn't. Marina Warner has barely scraped the surface of all there is to be said about myth and legend in connection with societal thinking in this little book (originally six essays for BBC radio). Each chapter undertakes a different aspect of society from women, to cannibalism, to our idealization of childhood. In all honesty, each one could've been a book in itself if expanded and pondered over. Due to the fact that each essay was relatively short it felt as if Warner's points were rushed and ill-researched. While I would put this book above some others that connect modern examples with myth, I still think that Warner could've done a more in-depth job and added more focus to individual chapters. They each seem to skip around a bit and lack effective organization.<br />Don't get me wrong, there are a number of gems in the pages of this work. Warner draws interesting parallels between myth and folklore and how it continues to resurface in modern times whether it be film, writing, television, etc. She also cites numerous outside sources that sound fascinating and that inspired her work. In a way, this work is a jumping-off point into a throng of directions into cultural criticism.	2002-11-27

Politically Correct Bedtime Stories is a hilarious romp through some of your favorite fairytales as you've never seen them before. In a world where it's becoming increasingly important to maintain a high level of political correctness, sometimes it's fun to sit back and laugh at the whole thing. Let's face it...who's never heard a phrase so politically correct that you had no idea what the person was talking about? Garner manages to maximize his PC'ness to an outlandish degree and still maintain the level of understanding and hilarity. After reading this book you will never think of Cinderella, The Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel, and a host of others quite the same way again. I'm off to order the other two books in the series, because this one is such a delightful little gem.	2002-11-27

While I was less than impressed with The Scarlet Letter when I read it in high school I LOVED it this time around. Hawthorne's rich use of language adds to what is already an intensely compelling story. Hester Prynne is a standout among a throng of submissive Puritan women and one of the most interesting heroines in literature. She steadfastly stands up for herself and her child's well-being amidst a storm of controversy surrounding her actions. Symbolically and literally, this is a beautiful novel that explores the inner workings of the human heart and various facets of forgiveness, guilt, passion, pride, self-worth, and the standards by which we judge those around us.	2002-11-15

The Bantam Classic edition presents the tales in Modern English translation alongside the Middle English so that one can fully appreciate the tales as Chaucer composed them, or if you're just in the mood for a fun romp you can speedily read the translation. The tales themselves move at a quick pace, so beginners will probably enjoy the modern version much more. <br />The Canterbury Tales revolve around a group of 29 on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral to pay homage to the martyred St. Thomas a'Becket. The members of the pilgrimage come from all walks of life, including a Knight, Prioress, Merchant, Miller, the ever-entertaining Wife of Bath, and many others. The Canterbury Tales are the pilgrims' stories and each one reflects the individual character's personality beautifully. One can't help but feel a part of this lively group.<br />Whether you like a bawdy, raucous tale or a morally sound fable you will definitely find something entertaining in this book. I laughed out loud several times and found Chaucer's use of symbolism, wit, wisdom, and the glimpse into 14th Century life absolutely fascinating.	2002-09-22

Hansen does an admirable job presenting the real life hardships of the mentally challenged and those who love and work with them, but the book seemed stilted and almost \\"too\\" autobiographical at times. By expanding his personal experiences, what seems only a limited degree, the author has flattened the characters and taken some of the interest out of his story. There was little emotion in the dialogue and character struggles, and even the heart-wrenching climax seemed distant and contrived. It was a good effort and an important story, but just not what I had hoped.	2002-09-22

On the whole, I found Empire Falls to be an enjoyable book with believably drawn characters, a tangible sense of place, and a delicately woven narrative. On the other hand, I felt that Russo introduced several interesting threads of plot that promised to be insightful, but then let them drift into nothingness without development. There was an incredible amount of conflict jammed into this novel, and while it helped keep the pace in the latter half of the book up to breakneck speed, some of the finer, more delicate points in the story were glossed over. I haven't had this much trouble deciding exactly what I think of a book in a good while, so I credit Russo with writing a thought-provoking, albeit noticeably flawed, work of fiction. I highly recommend the book for group discussion, as there is a ton of material from which to develop thoughts and opinions. <br />While I may have had some issues with the storytelling in general, the characters were absolute jewels. Even those written to be outlandishly annoying had redeeming qualities, and I found myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions. <br />I look forward to reading more of Russo's work and would urge booklovers to pick up Empire Falls and decide for themselves exactly what they think.	2002-07-06

When I first began to read Lady Chatterley's Lover I thought it was going to be quite a chore. I'm used to flowery language and all that, but I just wasn't in the mood for what I anticipated to be a sex-charged love story. Much to my surprise I got MUCH more from this wonderful classic.<br />D.H. Lawrence makes some striking observations about the state of the social classes in post WWI England, as well as providing some good insights into tough individual decisions we make in regard to relationships. I had limited knowledge of the post-war subject beforehand, but I felt that I learned a great deal in the process of reading. At times the book seemed repetitive, as if Lawrence were beating me over the head with his message, sacrificing character and plot in the process, but after all was said and done I couldn't say that it was a bad book. It's a very insightful, multi-layered work and I'm very glad I read it. The fact that the book was widely banned from publication in its early days is just another tempting reason to read it although, by today's standards, what was so risqu√© then borders on the ridiculous for us now. As long as you remind yourself of the time period in which it was written you'll be just fine...the laughs and raised eyebrows in conjunction with more serious themes are a pleasant mix.	2002-06-25

The Cider House Rules is my first foray into the world of John Irving's writing, and I assure you it won't be my last. This has to be one of the most touching, tender, poignant, witty, and socially mindful books that I've read in a very long time, and it will stay with me indefinitely.<br />The engrossing tale of Homer Wells begins when he's just an infant in the St. Cloud's orphanage. Four failed adoptions later Homer is a seemingly permanent fixture and medical prot√©g√© to the orphanage founder, Dr. Larch. A wonderful father/son relationship grows between the two, but just as Dr. Larch and the orphanage staff think all is right with the world their beloved Homer sets out into the great wide open on the road to love, discovery, and the loss of innocence. In a nutshell, he's about to encounter the real world. And that's just the beginning...<br />Irving tackles some tough issues in this book, namely abortion, racism, and the free will and individual choices with which we all struggle throughout our lives...and most importantly, it doesn't sound preachy!!! The writing is superb. Some might be turned off by the depth of detail, but in this case it serves to immerse the reader fully in the lives of Irving's rich characters. It'll make you laugh, cry, and cheer. It's so worth the time.	2002-06-09

After reading Where the Heart Is I took a reallyyyy long time getting around to Honk and Holler. I thought surely there was no way to top her first effort, but I've happily been proven wrong.<BR> <BR>Caney, a paraplegic Vietnam vet; Vena Takes Horse, a lonely drifter; MollyO, a lonesome, under-appreciated mother on the verge of love; and Bui Kahn, a dangerously misplaced Vietnamese man waiting for this family, all get wound up in each other's lives under the glow of a neon sign reading The Honk and Holler Opening Soon. The sign is a town joke and 12-year-old mistake, but nevertheless, this diverse group of people comes to call the restaurant home and each other family.<br />In traditional Letts style the characters of this story are vivid, engrossing, and endearing. So often a cast of peripheral characters can pale in comparison to the main characters that the book focuses on, but that's not the case with Honk. Each character feels as if they fit equally into the framework of the story. <br />The Honk and Holler Opening Soon is a journey through love, loss, struggle, triumph, and heartbreak but it never seems sappy or overdone....just real. If you've ever lived in a small town you'll likely identify with many of Letts' characters and situations, and even if you haven't lived the life of the story you'll recognize their individual worth and inner beauty.	2002-06-02

Like many others have said, what happened around PAGE 200 (major plot twist)??? In all seriousness, Kidd has done an impressive job bringing to life the adventures and uncertainties of being a Freshman Graphic Design student. Even readers with absolutely no interest in the field will surely be able to appreciate this book for its razor-sharp wit, quirky characters, and impressive sense of tension. <br />The main character is a joy to follow. He's Holden Caulfield'esque without the overdone self-loathing and self-destructive tendencies. He has a tidbit of angst but mostly uncertainty in the workings of life in general; he's a normal kid living away from home for the first time and enjoying the highs and lows of the college experience, and coming into his own...not to mention, dealing with some unorthodox friends and professors along the way. <br />I would certainly recommend this book to friends from any age group and background, because it's laugh-out-loud funny with just the right amount of drama thrown in to make it feel substantial and make a statement. I can only hope that Chip Kidd will write more in the future.	2002-05-20

As books are usually better than films I was elated to finally settle in and begin the journey. I will say that the book and movie are dramatically different in many respects and I love both for different reasons, but this novel surpasses the film in a great many of those respects.<BR> <BR>Just short of the new Millennium (1999), the Earth receives its first message from intelligent life in outer space. Ellie Arroway is the romantic, ambitious scientist at the center of Sagan's tale and her personal struggles and beliefs, as well as those of her colleagues, magnify the sentiments of the world around them. They are faced with meeting a new alien intelligence, new tests of faith, many of which they would've never expected within the realms of science, and they must come to terms with their new knowledge in order to make sense of an ever-changing world.<BR> <BR>How would a society react to such a realization of life beyond our planet, how would it affect the everyday lives of those involved, and how would it change the way science and religion function? All of these questions are addressed in Sagan's staggering, uplifting, poignant piece of fiction.<BR> <BR>Steeped in technical and scientific terms, the book is challenging, but incredibly fulfilling. I came away from the last page with a deep sense of satisfaction, awe, and a great regard for Sagan's method of bringing science to the masses. This book really makes you evaluate the harmony of science and faith and points out that the two, indeed, can work together.	2002-05-18

Initially, I was intimidated by the amount of mathematical theory and high-level concepts that this book presented alongside the life of John Nash, but how can a biography do a mathematical genius justice without it?  For those who persevered through the heavily math-laden sections of the text, I think Nasar did a great job making it as accessible as possible for the average reader, like myself. <br />     The story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. is, without a doubt, an intriguing one. As I read along and discovered the difficulties and hurdles associated with schizophrenia I steadily began to wonder what it must feel like, first, to be a genius, second, to be a genius increasingly out of touch with what he loves most. Nash's life was one of isolation, first due to his incredible ability to think, and then because of his outrageous ideas and delusions. His odd little ways, along with his progressively more noticeable mental illness, took away many of the chances at greatness that Nash had always felt were just on the horizon.<BR> <BR>     The devotion of his wife, Alicia, was Dr. Nash's saving grace at times. Even though she had to separate from him to get a bit of perspective on life and just take a break, she never turned her back on him. Alicia was always willing to help his life and career whenever possible. <br />     It's quite astounding that Nash was able to endure so many years of hellish mental turmoil and come out on the other side to receive one of the greatest of all honors...the Nobel Prize. Throughout the book, I constantly found myself pulling for Nash and longing to give his naysayers a good slap. His mind and his genius are truly beautiful, and I believe Dr. Nash is one of America's greatest treasures. I feel enriched by this story and reminded that all things are possible with determination, support, and perhaps a little good luck thrown in for good measure. Even though the book is difficult at times, give it a go...I don't think you'll regret it.	2002-04-06

I was terribly impressed by the first in the Guenevere series, &quot;Guenevere: Queen of the Summer Country.&quot; I can't say that I was disappointed with the second installment, but it did not quite live up to the magic of the first. <br />As often happens with the middle book in a trilogy, there seems to be a moderate amount of filler material and repetition in the action. Having said that, I most definitely still enjoy some of the liberties and twists that Miles has taken with traditional Arthurian legend. Hearing the story from Guenevere's perspective is a wonderful way to go. At times I wanted to shake the characters and tell them to stop their whining, but despite some of their bad choices, they were well-rounded and believable. <br />Even though I enjoyed this book less than the first, I will continue to follow the series, and anxiously anticipate reading the third book. I am curious to see how Miles will wrap up her story and how it will mirror traditional Arthurian legend. Miles has a delightfully rich writing style that serves to greatly enhance her stories.	2002-03-31

I'm incredibly glad that I did, because this book was nothing short of touching. <br />Ender Wiggin grows up in a futuristic society where families can only have an allotted number of children, and the Wiggins's just happen to be allowed to produce three incredible geniuses. At the age of 6, Ender enters a battle school where he will be conditioned and trained to be the greatest of intergalactic commanders, destined to save the world from the latest and largest alien attack that Earth has ever seen. The fate of the world lies in the hands of a boy genius with hopes, dreams, and a family that he must leave behind to fulfill his duty. <br />Card does an exquisite job tapping into Ender's young, but extraordinarily advanced mind. There is a mixture of childhood longing and ageless maturity that makes Ender a tragic and inspiring hero. With surprises at every turn, breathtaking tension, and heart-wrenching characters, Ender's Game can stand proudly as a classic far above any labels that might be tacked to it.	2002-03-18

I was afraid I would be bored, having read the same old Cinderella story so many times, but Maguire really adds his own twist and I found myself sucked into what felt like a light work of historical fiction. <br />The story takes place in Holland and deals a great deal with painting and the tulip industry. From this perspective I would highly recommend the book to those who enjoyed Girl With a Pearl Earring, because it has some of that same flavor. <br />The only thing that kept me from giving the book 5 stars was the feeling that Maguire could've made me care for a few of the characters more. They weren't at all flat, but there might've been more emotional involvement if a few things were handled differently. Despite that one issue, this is a fun, relaxing, overall excellent book, and one that I will probably re-read in the future.	2002-03-05

This is the story of four young people...Brandon, Greg, Stephen, and Meredith. They're the closest of friends until they start high school at Cannon, New Orleans' premiere private school, but what follows is the descent of some into the darkest realms of the human heart, while others shine brighter than ever before.<br />Rice's writing is impressively vivid, showing the horror of homophobia, murder, and intolerance alongside the beauty of inner strength, true friendship, and the power of open-mindedness and loyalty. The entire second half of the book left me blue in the face, due to the fact that it held me in check, teetering on the edge of my seat, and completely breathless. I don't think I've ever read a book with so many unexpected twists and turns, better than any roller coaster I could imagine.<br />My words hardly do justice to this multifaceted and utterly astonishing piece of literature. It will leave you with tears in your eyes, begging for more, and the words, \\"Fear cannot touch me, It can only taunt me...\\" ringing in your head indefinitely	2002-01-25

I'd heard numerous good things about it, but feared that Bridget's man, weight, and self-esteem problems would make her a terminal whiner. To my surprise and delight, I found this book laugh-out-loud funny and much more clever than anticipated. <br />Bridget is a 30-something, single career-woman, dealing with the ups and downs of dating, a career, and life in general. She's constantly nagged about her relationship status by her eccentric mother and numerous family friends. You can imagine that she's tickled pink to finally be woo'ed by her boss, the charming and rascally, Daniel. Well, needless to say, nothing goes completely smooth with Daniel...if it did, this book would be much shorter. The antics that Bridget finds herself in, along and with an entertaining group of friends, are nothing short of hilarious.<br />I was also surpised and impressed by several blatant references to Pride and Prejudice (there's a Mr. Darcy in this book). I was even more surprised to see many parallels between the two stories as I read along, so keep your eyes peeled for these amusing similarities.<br />This is a wonderful book that I will keep close at hand when I need a laugh.	2002-01-12

It's been awhile since I've read any literature involving flowery language and staunch manners but I'm so glad I came back to it!!! Pride and Prejudice is extremely well-written and the characterization is fabulous. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy create delicious sparks with their constant head-butting and romantic tension. Elizabeth can probably best be described as someone who embodies the best manners, heart, and intentions without being sappy or spineless; she is incredibly intelligent and strong-willed. It's interesting to read this book and think of how women of the time had to play the love &quot;game&quot; and marry above their station to progress in society. It also sheds light on Jane Austen's own independent state of mind that her most darling character was a total fireball! This book will give you constant butterflies and provides a nice glimpse into the comedy and pettiness of the society of the time, all the while, weaving a charming tale not soon to be forgotten.	2001-12-27

I picked up The Lord of the Rings in anticipation of the films and never had any expectation of being completely swept away by them. I've never read fantasy, I've never seen the cartoon versions of the story, and I've never given much attention to all the hooplah, but now I completely understand why this trilogy has earned the title &quot;best of the 20th century.&quot;<br />Frodo Baggins is the most unlikely of heroes. He's content to relax among the flowers and trees of the Shire and live a quiet life among friends. Luckily, for the sake of Middle-Earth, he agrees to a perilous journey to destroy the One Ring, which if not destroyed, could shatter the lives of everyone in Middle-Earth forever.<br />Adventure, danger, madness, war, redemption, and self-sacrifice are just a few of the stages that Frodo and his Fellowship will undergo throughout their epic journey. This is more than a story...it is representative of all our lives and all our struggles. There are endless lessons in this timeless tale, and it is worth every word on every page. Most important of all, The Lord of the Rings reminds us that &quot;even the smallest person can change the course of the future.&quot;	2001-12-19

They're the ones people cross the street to avoid...the Owens women are witches. Raised by their two aunts, Sally and Gillian Owens grow up to be polar opposites. Sally is always practical and straight-laced; most concerned with keeping the lives of her two daughters as normal as possible. Gillian, on the other hand, is a free spirit...perhaps a little too free at times. <br />This story follows Sally and Gillian through their trials and tribulations with life, love, and death, and Hoffman's wonderful storytelling makes it, simply, magical! Wonderful twists and turns lurk around every corner of this funny, touching, and at times, dark story...brimming over with themes of compassion, redemption, and inner strength. Playing on every human emotion, Hoffman has struck absolute gold. <br />If you've ever seen the movie,forget it, and pick up this wonderful book!	2001-11-25

However, with the movie on the horizon, I decided to take the plunge and I couldn't be more glad that I did. This book swept me into a world of magic and wizardry, and more importantly, the valuable lessons of life. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and the lot, are delightful characters that everyone can relate to in some way. Their story is full of adventure, friendship, and heart-stopping antics that are sure to be a treat for readers of any age. My compliments to J.K. Rowling and the series that is destined to become a classic.	2001-11-24

I was compelled to read The Vagina Monologues after listening to Eve Ensler speak on television about issues concerning women. She's witty and incredibly intelligent, just as The Vagina Monologues proved to be. I sat down with this book and finished in just a matter of hours. I can't say that I've ever read a book that captures the essence of womanhood more completely, in such a humorous, touching, and insightful way. Stories from real women of all ages, from all walks of life, and from such varied backgrounds make this book a real gem. I recommend this book to any man who wants to get inside the female mind, or any female who wants to recognize what a magical thing womanhood can be.	2001-10-27

The first in a trilogy, this books follows Guenevere from her reign as Queen of the Summer Country, through her marriage to Arthur, wars, childbirth, and finally her affair with Lancelot. I expected this book to be another regurgitation of the same old legend, but there were some very interesting twists. I found the characters to be very three dimensional and interesting and came to deeply care for, or despise, all of them. I also enjoyed the fact that the story comes from Guenevere's point of view. I found her to be a strong character, but alas, a little frustrating (as in most Arthurian legend). I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy and anticipate more twists and turns.	2001-09-21

The black and white photographs show people from young to old surrounded by things or people that they love and that make them happy. The focus of the book is on the fact that people are LIVING with AIDS rather than focusing on death in any way. The best part of the book are the captions that accompany each photograph...words of wisdom and life from the people featured in the pages.	2001-09-21
US	48584755	R3VJTHS0D41XP9	0060977493	521720988	The God of Small Things	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A pleasant surprise	The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy's first novel, was quite the pleasant surprise. I found this book a bit slow at the beginning but was soon drawn into Estha and Rahel's world.<br />This is the story of twins, Estha and Rahel, and their mixed up, backward, slightly twisted family. We hear the story of the twins' childhood, why Estha finally stopped speaking, the joyous and horrific things that changed their lives forever; we also get glimpses of their later years when Estha still didn't speak and Rahel longed to ease his pain. The story also touches on the Marxist/Communist conflict through the lives of the characters. This is far from a mainly political story, but it does serve as a backdrop.<br />Arundhati Roy's language and writing are very unusual but charming. I found some of the metaphors in the book deserved underlining and committing to memory. I find it hard to explain her style, but the best way I could explain would be to say that her style is simple...like that of a child...but beautiful in its simplicity and candor. You really feel that you are living life through the eyes of the twins.<br />I almost put this book back on the shelf before I was 100 pages in, but I'm so glad I didn't. The story is gripping and touching and one to be remembered.	2001-09-10

I've always been fascinated with other cultures and was drawn to the subject of genital mutilation in Africa. I've always found this to be a shocking and controversial topic whenever I've heard it discussed. <br />This book is the story of Tashi and her husband Adam and some surrounding friends of theirs. Tashi suffers horribly from her past experiences with the mutilation ceremonies. I found Walker's account to be heart wrenching and brutally honest. One can only imagine the emotional and psychological effects of such a traumatic procedure. <br />The book itself is a gem. The story unfolds a small piece at a time, like a secret being whispered to you. It all fits together wonderfully and forms a thought-provoking tale.	2001-09-03

Girl With a Pearl Earring is the story of Griet, young housemaid in the Vermeer home. Vermeer is a very well-respected painter and his work is highly valuable today, since he only painted 35 known pieces. In this work of fiction, Griet is, basically, Vermeer's young muse. After she moves into the house to assist Vermeer's wife, she slowly is befriended by the painter and becomes his assistant.<br />This book is full of rich characters...from the seemingly aloof Vermeer himself, to the bratty and spiteful daughter Cornelia. One of the highlights of the book is Maria Thins, the grandmother of the house, and one of the few friends Griet can trust. Maria is a quiet conspirator to help Griet in all the problems she has throughout the story. <br />There isn't one point in this book where it becomes unbelievable. The whole story is spectulation as to who the young girl in the painting Girl With the Pearl Earring actually is. This book will pull you into Griet's world and convince you that her life and story took place exactly as written by Chevalier. Overall, this is a rich, warm, and atmospheric work that is deserving of its best-seller status.	2001-09-02

Born to a poor canon and a Saxon woman, Joan is chastized for her desire to learn. Learned women were thought to be vessels of the devil and dangers to society. Joan's love of learning endures from her meager beginnings, through the ranks of monk, priest, and so on. This story isn't only about Joan's education, for it also encompasses her seemingly star-crossed love with the brave and valiant Gerold. You'll have to read it yourself to find out how they get along. This is a very well-rounded story that will suck you into the world of 9th century Rome and won't let you go until long after you've read the last page. This isn't only the story of a female Pope, it's the story of brilliant woman who is stifled and constricted by her gender and rises above the constraints of society to become the best human being possible. Touching and breathtaking, to say the least.	2001-08-28

Hemingway's description of Paris in the 1920's is alluring and captivating. Every description no matter how small is vivid and alive. Everything from the taste of oysters to stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein seem to jump right off the page and haul you into Hem's world. <br />I would recommend this book to anyone, whether they be an avid Hemingway fan or someone who sits at the opposite end of the spectrum. Hemingway's philosophy of always writing the truth, just writing one true sentence...the truth brings Hemingway to life.	2001-08-19

I admit, I found the ending a little hard to swallow and some aspects of the story a bit weak, yet it had such a tight grip on my heartstrings that it seemed to downplay the faults. Shreve masterfully portrays heartbreak and grief on every page. For anyone who has ever lost a loved one, this book can probably describe every step in the healing process. <br />Shreve wisely uses flashbacks periodically through the book to give a glimpse of events that led up to Jack's death. These glimpses into Kathryn's past really bring her story to life. <br />Even though there are alot of dark feelings in this work, it's not only about the darkness of death. It successfully conveys the hope and light of life as it unfolds toward the future.	2001-08-19
US	48584755	R3AWX7X1XYQJ3L	0425162443	139645956	The Rapture of Canaan	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A vivid and engaging read	There aren't enough good words to describe The Rapture of Canaan by Sheri Reynolds. This is the story of Ninah, grandchild to the founder of a radical church called &quot;The Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind.&quot; The church strictly forbids fornication, lying, or any other type of sin, real or imagined, that you can think of. Some of Grandpa Herman's punishments for sin include hefty donations to the church, putting nettles in one's bed, or even sleeping in an open grave. <br />For young Ninah all these punishments and threats of damnation are terrifying for a girl who is coming of age and discovering feelings for the opposite sex. The object of her desire takes the shape of her prayer partner, James. The events that follow will change Ninah's life, as well as the lives of those around her.<br />Reynolds' portrayal of James and Ninah is charming, warm, witty, and tragic, all rolled into one. The southern flavor of the book only adds to the delicious atmosphere. I found all of the characters to be very believable and important to the overall story. Great characterization and a thick plot can be hard to come by at times, yet Reynolds executes it perfectly.<br />Sheri Reynolds has me hooked with The Rapture of Canaan and I can't wait to read more of her work. This book will capture your heart.	2001-08-18

My first comment for this play....it's much more effective when read aloud. We started this play in a theater class at my university and I finished reading it alone. There's a world of difference. <br />There are so many varied reviews on Waiting for Godot and I must admit it could go either way. This play can be considered symbolic of everything, or symbolic of nothing. Some say that Beckett was trying to portray human loneliness and a search for meaning in the unknown (Godot, aka God). Others say, that's a big assumption and the point of the play was that it had no point at all. Basically it all comes down to your perspective. <br />There's an age-old question about art....does the &quot;correct&quot; meaning of art come from the intent of its creator or does the meaning come from the impression of the viewer or reader? An example would be the paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe. Critics and historians frequently push the idea that her huge flower paintings are symbolic of human genitalia while O'Keeffe denied that she had any intent to portray that symbolism. <br />There are about a zillion interpretations of Waiting for Godot and no one will ever agree. While I would say that I wasn't highly entertained by this play, I respect this piece as a classic and one that has sparked controversy. Controversy, after all, is the highest level of flattery.	2001-08-11

I thought it was going to be just another boring History text. To my surpise and delight I was hooked after only a few pages.<br />This true story of Harriet Jacobs, a 19th century slave, is absolutely mind-blowing. Ms. Jacobs spent 7 years of her life living in what was literally a wooden box in the rafters of her grandmother's shed. She was waiting for the perfect moment to escape to the North and bring her children out of slavery. From her perch in the shed she could look out onto the street and watch her children play and hear them talk about how much they missed their mother and wished to see her again (they had no idea she was in hiding). Jacobs even went so far as to send letters to her vicious master to make him believe that she was really in the Northern states.<br />Sure everyone learns about slavery in school, but we only get the narrow and highly shortened version of what it was to live in slavery. This book is an emotional account of slavery in all its brutality and what it was like to live in fear every moment of every day. Jacobs is a perfect portrait of an unbreakable spirit.	2001-08-11

As time goes on and I think back to this book I love it more and more. <br />This is the story of Felicity and Sonny.....life-long lovers with a turbulent and sometimes downright heartbreaking relationship. Felicity, 20 years Sonny's senior, is brazen and even loopy at times. She lends a great deal of humor to the story as well as veiled sadness. <br />Sonny, on the other hand is a huge jerk throughout most of the story as he becomes more and more bitter and jaded. Felicity seems to be the only spark left in his life...a spark which he almost puts out. <br />Running parallel to the story of Sonny and Felicity is the tale of Gravelda and Genipur. They are two rather primitive tribal people who are hauntingly similar to their modern-day counterparts. It's a story that Felicity tells to Sonny in chunks over the years as their meetings become fewer and farther between. The story allows Felicity to quietly vent her feelings about her relationship with Sonny. <br />This is a book that, even if you become a little dazed about in the process of reading, will stick to you long after you've read the last page. Far be it from me to withold credit where credit is due....and I must admit, this book is a jewel.	2001-08-11

Eugenides has a charming style of writing but it wasn't enough to pull this story out. In fact, the story itself wasn't so bad but I feel it would've been much more effective if it'd been told from another point of view.

Unconventional would be the understatement of the year when describing House of Leaves. Some people are so put off by the strange layout of the book that they don't read it. MISTAKE!! I have to say, even though this is a difficult read at times (long footnotes, backward and upside down text) it's a total reading experience that you will not regret when it's all said and done. This book is so far beyond JUST horror. The dark and abyss-like house can be equated to secrets, fears, all the dark parts of ourselves that grow and can get out of control if not dealt with.	2001-08-07
