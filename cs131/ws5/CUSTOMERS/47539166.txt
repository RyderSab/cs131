The first novel I recommended that book to everyone I knew at the time, and I must say they done it again. I loved this one as well but the first one is still my favorite.

My only problem was that it was so short, but unlike some other authors she closed off the book very well, you got to see what happened to all the characters and was not left hanging.

I read everything he writes and this was added to the list. The Eric Jerome Dickey story was good but not what I expected from him I also read everything he wrote and this was good but it just surprised me. The Marcus Major story about Kenya and Amir was written so well. After I read Good Peoples I was wondering how the love story of those two went,and I loved it. Marcus Major has become one of my favorite authours and I look forward to his upcoming work. The Colin Channer story was the first I read from him and it was ok. To me the story was too drawn out, I just could'nt get into it as fast as the others but it was an ok read. I don't think his writting style suits me very well that was the first and last story I think I'm going to read from him.	2001-03-31
