The way these books are written are not what i like. It had hardly any humor and I didnt want to stay up and read it. The way the main character was and the way her freinds acted was almost the same. I dont know what to say except for that i didnt like it and probably wont like the others. If you think I should then go to my info and email me.<BR>I do have to say I did like the T-shirts at the end of every chapter.	2004-02-07

Old Magic is one that i grabbed around Christmas to just spend my money. It looked good by the cover and it definetly was.<BR>Jarrod moves to a new town and already has troubles with his new classes. Kate sees something different in him and when he makes the room shake after getting mad she knows he is 'special' just like her. she tries to tell him but he wont listen. But when his family is in physical trouble they go back in time to fix the past...the way past. <BR>The book is great throughout. I do have to admit that it is slow in the first four or five chapters but the rest make up for it. Marianne Curley's book is great and I want to read others of hers and hope they are just as good or better!	2004-02-07

I loved how it showed what happened twenty years later with Morgan<BR>The book starts off with a jaw dropper that made me say..no this cant be! The rest of the book was great but I did miss the romances with Hunter and Morgan in the old ones. Still a great book and SHOULD be next to the others on your shelf at home.	2004-02-07

This book I had my eye on for quite some time and when i finally bought it it wasnt what i suspected.<BR>Gemma Doyle is sent to a private school for proper girls after her mother dies. While she is there Gemma finds out that she can go into a realm and find dead people and communicate with them. When she brings friends along with her, Kartrik, a boy who is apart of a group trying to stop her stays close to her. She soon finds herself in trouble and has to get out.<BR>As you can see it was hard to explain it. This book did have its great spots that i really got in to but it was slow. I read this book in about a week and a couple of days (thats long for me) and i finished it mainly to see what would happen to a character and also to see if it got better. Also I felt that the author threw in things everyonce in a while to give it a new spin and it didnt go well with this story. <BR>I really wished I didnt buy this book but oh well, maybe I'll forget about it and maybe read it again later.	2004-02-07

Moiras story i have to say is another way of taking it. <BR>Moira, who is morgans daughter, is 15 years old and is a natural teen learning her powers and waiting to be initiated. Throughout the book Moira learns of who her mom really is and what her life was really about. Also Moira learns of things that change her perspecitve entirely.<BR>I only had one dissapointment from this book. Morgan was not the same as the other 14 books. She was saddened and not full of love and energy as before and her \\"out there\\" life was one of the best parts of the other books.<BR>But reading about Moira is a good thing to read about. She is spunky and pretty much like her mom with her love life. \\"almost\\". <BR>Throughout this book Cate surprises the reader with hidden secrets that are hard to figure out unless you sit with the booka and analyze each page.Pretty much some might make your jaw drop in surprise! <BR>In ways the books are the same. High School love, enemys, strong powers, fear, anticipation, death and love in Morgan.<BR>I do have to say that i would rather read books 1-14 over and over again and only want to read this one once or twice, but, it is worth reading becuase it completes the package. Like i said in the headline. The book is not Super, great!, but not super as some might see it to be at first.	2003-11-16

Cal is acting strange and makes Morgan more nervous. Towards the middle of the book Morgans life is shifted when an unexpected visitor shows up. <BR>This book is great and I couldnt put it down.

But every thing starts to simmer down when weird things are happening to the both of them. <BR>Morgan sees more of friends and learns dark secrets that she does not want to be part of. <BR>I especially love this book more than some becuase soemthing happens that makes you either smile from ear to ear or make your jaw drop.

It is very hard to type a review for all of the sweep books and try to say something different instead of that it is great! Moprgan and her friends get introduced more into the life of Wicca. This book has romance, suspense and a wild turn at the end that wants you to run to the nearest book store and get the next one. <BR>This book is great and you should read it, along with the others of course.	2003-10-09

I saw the cover and it looked intesting so i bought. Soon enough I was reading it 24/7. This series is a good way to get you started on fiction witchcraft books. Morgan plays a strong character that is going through a tough time. Having a first love with a twist is the best way to go. I give this 5 stars and more!	2003-10-09

But, it still is stuck in my mind. Veterinarians touch has a way of telling it that gets the readers attention because its not an eduacation of veterinary medicine but stories OF veterinarians.<BR>This book has sad, funny and serious storys that will stick in your mind for a long time...for example....this one part i remeber where a vet gave this lady hormone stimulants for her dog and they worked so well for the dog she gave them to her husband and lets just say that she has been coming back for more.<BR>This book had partly inspired me to look more into the field of being a vet and you are the same as me it will probably do the same for you.<BR>There was a peice so go rent this or buy it if you are interested in the practice or just like the subject.	2003-09-18

I had already read all of them once but had to read them again. The good thing about the Harry Potter series that Rowling's books are filled with so much interesting and suspensful things is that when you read it a second time its like you just picking it up for the first time. I probably finished this series in about a week plus a couple of days beucuase i couldnt put it down...GO pick this up.	2003-09-15

I was hesitant to read it beucuase the summary on the back was misleading but i decided that i would give it a try and im glad i did.<BR>Telling an excellent fantasy through the eyes of two teenagers is great when a teenager wants to read it. <BR>Phillip pullman has in his books new kinds of fantasy like for example their animal companions. He tells it in such a good way that no one will ever be able to copy it.<BR>All im trying to say is that if you need a new book to read (and i know i say this on most of my reviews) then pick this up!	2003-09-15

She goes through troubles but it falls together great in the end.<BR>Hunter and Morgan are so great together, better than her and Cal couldve ever been. I think that im going to go read it again.

Seeing the book through someone else that has not been in the book very long was very good. Also getting away to another town and being introduced to new, and interesting people was also great.

This book surprised me on how i couldnt put it down!!! Fantasy is not on the top of my list of books to buy, but, this book I had to. When I first started reading it it was slow, but when i told myself that it could get better, it did!! This really caught my attention and kept me reading it all the way through. This fantasy is exciting and filled with action, yes there was major amounts of sex in it but that was apart of the story and it wouldnt of made it to publishing if i wasnt in it. For all of you who are complaining about the violence and the sex, i think that you need to stick to childrens books if it bothers you so much. This book was great and i cant wait to read the next one.	2003-09-03
