Over half a century after its original publication, \\"The Origins of Totalitarianism\\" is still the most important treatise on totalitarianism in government.  Arendt's book is also just as relevant and important today as it was in the mid-20th Century. <br /> <br />The book is divided into three main sections: Antisemitism, Imperialism, and Totalitarianism.  In the first section, Arendt tracks the rise of antisemitism in Europe, looking mainly at 19th Century events and situations that aided the spread of this phenomenon through European culture.  The Dreyfus Affair, which sharply divided France and ultimately became a political battle between antisemites and their opponents at the end of the 19th Century, gets more attention than any other event in this chapter. <br /> <br />In the middle section on imperialism, Arendt shows how the rise and fall of the continental European imperialist movements of the 19th Century (mainly, Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism) helped set the stage for their 20th Century totalitarian successors.  As she puts it in opening the chapter on \\"the Pan Movements\\": \\"Nazism and Bolshevism owe more to Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism (respectively) than to any other ideology or political movement.  This is most evident in foreign politics, where the strategies of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia have followed so closely the well-known programs of conquest outlined by the pan-movements before and during the first World War that totalitarian aims have frequently been mistaken for the pursuance of some permanent German or Russian interests.  While neither Hitler nor Stalin has ever acknowledged his debt to imperialism in the development of his methods of rule, neither has hesitated to admit his indebtedness to the pan-movements' ideology or to imitate their slogans.\\"  It's a testament to the truth and prescience of Arendt's work that the preceding passage remains as timely as ever, given the ongoing collapse of the Pan-Arabist movement which dominated the Middle East during the second half of the 20th Century and the battle between democracy and totalitarian Islamofascism over which will rise up next. <br /> <br />The first two sections lead perfectly into the third and most important part of the book: the section on totalitarianism.  Arendt shows how Nazism and Bolshevism were much more similar in their goals, practices, ideologies, and enemies than many people often believe or want to admit.  They were both mass movements that sprang from cultures that had largely dismissed any objective truths.  (Arendt: \\"The ideal subject of totalitarianism is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction and the distinction between true and false no longer exist.\\")  Both movements sought power for the sake of power, were rigidly ideological, made widespread use of terror, sought not only to punish and kill their enemies (as many brutal governments before them had done) but to dehumanize them and erase any trace of their existence from the memories of the governments' other subjects, a phenomenon introduced to the world by these 20th Century totalitarian governments.   <br /> <br />Many people have said in the decades since the Holocaust and the Soviet Gulag that the world should never let these atrocities happen again.  But the sad irony is that many of these same people then promote a materialist, existentialist worldview that are the breeding grounds for the same radical totalitarian governments that ultimately carry out these atrocities.  Arendt recognized this problem: \\"...We actually have nothing to fall back on in order to understand a phenomenon that nevertheless confronts us with its overpowering reality and breaks down all standards we know.  There is only one thing that seems to be discernible: we may say that radical evil has emerged in connection with a system in which all men have become equally superfluous.  The manipulators of this system believe in their own superfluousness as much as in that of all others, and the totalitarian murderers are all the more dangerous because they do not care if they themselves are alive or dead, if they ever lived or never were born... Totalitarian solutions may well survive the fall of totalitarian regimes in the form of strong temptations which will come up whenever it seems impossible to alleviate political, social, or economic misery in a manner worthy of man.\\" <br /> <br />So where do we go from here?  \\"Never again?\\"  I'd love to think so, but I'm not betting on it.  I don't think Hannah Arendt would either.	2005-03-26
US	50007423	R1KBABDJ32H8WS	0300096933	131276839	Jonathan Edwards: A Life	Books	5	12	15	N	N	A serious look at Edwards' life and times.	In introducing his biography of Jonathan Edwards, George Marsden writes, \\"My aspiration... is to make Edwards intelligible to widely diverse audiences by first attempting to depict him in his own time and in his own terms.\\"  Marsden achieved his goal, and it was a goal that was critical to making a great biography of Jonathan Edwards, something this book most definitely is.    Jonathan Edwards is easily one of the most intelligent and important figures in American history.  He comes as close as any other American thinker to being a true, Western, classical philosopher.  His most famous discourse on the nature of the human will, \\"Freedom of the Will\\" as it is commonly known, is one of the greatest contributions to that several millenia old debate.  And while Marsden is a good story-teller and great at developing the culture and general worldview that shaped the setting in which the events of Edwards' life took place, it is when he is summarizing Edwards' theosophy that he truly excels in this book.  (Summarizing Edwards' theological and philosophical arguments is not an easy task by any stretch and has so often been done incorrectly, whether accidentally or intentionally.)    Edwards, the grandson of another famous Colonial American pastor, Solomon Stoddard, lived a pretty normal and uneventful life, even for most religiously pious puritans in 18th Century New England.  While he was clearly blessed with a sharp intellect and a strong drive to succeed that was recognizable from early on in his life, he never fought in any wars, never had any major scandals in his life (whether committed by himself or those close to him), was a responsible, slightly overbearing student while in college at Yale, and lived what was just simply as holy a life as would seem to be humanly possible.  This doesn't make for an exciting biographical subject, but Marsden does a great job creating a story that allows the reader to meet Edwards but also gain a deep understanding of an often overlooked place and time in American history that were fundamental to laying the cultural foundation for what became the United States of America.  It's nearly impossible for 21st Century Americans to place themselves in the mindset of an 18th Century New Englander, so many of the former group simply dismiss the beliefs of the latter as a mere historical footnote.  As Marsden writes, to the New Englander of that time the premise of hell \\"was as genuine a reality as China.\\"  Try explaining that to a 21st Century Westerner and then getting them to take seriously, on an intellectual level, the worldview of an entire region of adherents to such a belief.  Yet the generation raised by Jonathan Edwards and his generally like-minded (generally Calvinist) peers would later set in motion a project that would result in the most powerful nation in the history of the planet Earth.  To dismiss or flippantly mock the core beliefs of the fathers and teachers of such a nation's creators is to do nothing but brag of one's own ignorance.    Marsden clearly realizes how big a mistake it is to do this, so he has worked very hard to understand exactly what it was that Jonathan Edwards believed and was arguing.  It is in the sections where Marsden is presenting Edwards' theology that this otherwise good biography becomes excellent.  Marsden, on Edwards' view of the will and its freedom:    \\"In Edwards' view the only sensible way to talk of the free will was that one is free to do what one wants to do.  That was also, he said, the common sense meaning of freedom.  'Let the person come by his volition or choice how he will, yet, if he is able, and there is nothing in the way to hinder his pursuing and executing his will, the man is fully and perfectly free, according to the primary and common notion of freedom.'  If having free will, then, meant being free to do what wanted to do, that was another way of saying that one was free to follow one's own strongest motive.  Choosing and acting freelycould not mean anything other than that one was free to follow one's own strongest inclinations.  The alternative, said Edwards, that there was an agent called the 'will' inside us that was free not to follow our own strongest inclination, is absurd.\\"    This is an excellent biography and as close to a \\"must-read\\" for fans of historical American leaders as one will find.	2005-02-18

He who will be proved right in the end appears to be wrong and harmful before it.  But WHO will be proved right?  It will only be known later.  Meanwhile he is bound to act on credit and to sell his soul to the devil, in the hope of history's absolution... Politics can be relatively fair in the breathing spaces of history; at its critical turning points there is no other rule possible than the old one, that the end justifies the means.\\" -- from the diary of N.S. Rubashov in \\"Darkness at Noon\\" <br /> <br />V.S Rubashov is the fictional protagonist of Arthur Koestler's \\"Darkness at Noon.\\"  He is a high-ranking official in a Marxist totalitarian state based on the real-life Soviet Union under Stalin.  The book begins with Rubashov being imprisoned in one of the dungeons of the Communist system he helped create.  Rubashov was a top member of the Party from the beginning of the Revolution and a close associate of the leader, \\"No. 1\\" as he's called by his subjects, but just like in so many Communist states of the 20th Century, the machine that Rubashov helped set in motion eventually steamrolled over most of its makers as well. <br /> <br />\\"Darkness at Noon\\" is simply brilliant and will be especially interesting for anyone familiar with Stalin's Show Trials of the 1930s (the specific event on which the book is most directly based).  The reader is placed in the mind of Rubashov as he debates with himself about whether what he once fully believed (that the Party is justified in whatever it decides) is still true, even if that means his imprisonment and execution.  Who decides what is morally wrong, do such concepts as \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" even exist in reality, and what is not permissible in pursuit of the ideal?  Alone in his cell, in between his prison interrogations at the hands of lower-ranked products (Ivanov and the even younger and more ruthless Gletkin) of the Communist machine he helped create, Rubashov struggles with these questions.  If there is a morality higher than simply what the Party judges to be correct, was his whole life - soon to be ending as he well knows (having been on the executing end of the equation so many times) - lived in testament to a lie?  How would one even face such a conclusion other than with complete despair? <br /> <br />A reader sitting far removed from Rubashov's situation might think, \\"Of course what the Party is doing is wrong.  Whatever that may mean about his life, it would be better for Rubashov to face the truth before dying.\\"  But why is what the Party doing wrong?  Who  is anyone else to say?  If there is no higher morality, no \\"God,\\" then what is there but efficiency and power?  One might disagree with the EFFICIENCY of the Party's methods, but that is no grounds for disagreement with the Party's MORALITY.  For Rubashov to come to a conclusion that what the Party is doing is morally wrong (as opposed to merely inefficient) and therefore choose not to sign his name to a dishonest confession as his tormentors are demanding, he has to have an appeal to an authority greater than the Party.  But what in the world would THAT be? <br /> <br />As the interrogator Gletkin puts it, explaining to Rubashov why the end justifies the means: \\"The bulwark must be held, at any price and with any sacrifice.  The leader of the Party recognized this principle with unrivalled clearsightedness, and has consistently applied it... We did not recoil from crushing our own organizations abroad when the interests of the Bastion required it.  We did not recoil from co-operation with the police of reactionary countries in order to suppress revolutionary movements which came at the wrong moment.  We did not recoil from betraying our friends and compromising with our enemies, in order to preserve the Bastion.  That was the task which history had given us, the representative of the first victorious revolution.  The short-sighted, the aesthetes, the moralists did not understand.  But the leader of the Revolution understood that all depended on one thing: to be the better stayer.\\" <br /> <br />Who is anyone to say that the leader is morally wrong?	2005-01-22
US	50007423	R26EGO6WLAPFOD	0156421178	802050474	Homage to Catalonia	Books	5	63	66	N	N	One of the greatest war books of the 20th Century.	It's been said that George Orwell is every conservative's favorite liberal and every liberal's favorite conservative.  This book likely did more to create that sentiment than any of Orwell's other works. <br /> <br />\\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is the story of Orwell's experience fighting in Spain, during 1936 and 1937, against Franco's forces that were seeking to overthrow the Spanish government.  Orwell originally traveled to Spain simply to report on the war as a journalist, but falling in love with the people of Catalonia and their revolutionary, honestly egalitarian spirit, Orwell joined the Workers' Party of Marxist Unity (POUM) militia.   <br /> <br />Once enlisted, Orwell traveled to the front lines of the fight in Catalonia.  His observations of life on the front-line and the daily struggles for a soldier during war are at times funny, fascinating, and depressing.  Remarking on war, especially the politics of war, Orwell writes, \\"I believe that on such an issue as this no one is or can be completely truthful;\\" yet Orwell seems supernaturally honest throughout this book. <br /> <br />After risking his life for the socialist cause he believed in, even being shot in the neck, Orwell eventually realized that many people he once assumed were fighting for the same anti-Fascist cause as he were really no different than the enemy he was fighting.  The anti-Fascist soldiers were generally divided into Anarchists (who believed that a Marxist revolution should be the immediate goal) and Communists (who believed that the Fascists must be defeated first and the Marxist revolution addressed after that).  Orwell originally sided with the Communists in believing that the Fascists should be defeated first, but over time he came to realize that all the Communists were really wanting was the installation of their own totalitarian system.  This left Orwell to fight with and support the Anarchists who were far more genuine than the Communists and simply wanted to be free from any oppressive rule.  After months of political bickering, the pro-Stalin Communists in Spain began to arrest and remove the Anarchists with whom they had originally partnered in the fight against Franco, and many of Orwell's friends and brothers-in-arms were arrested and executed.  Orwell, still recovering from his gunshot wound to the neck, barely managed to escape from Spain and avoid being caught in the brutal purge of the Anarchists.  Knowing he had done nothing morally wrong or anything for which he should logically be arrested, Orwell inititally wanted to stay and help free his friends arrested in the Communist crackdown.  But he soon came to realize, \\"It did not matter what I had done or not done. This was not a round-up of criminals; it was merely a reign of terror. I was not guilty of any definite act, but I was guilty of `Trotskyism'. The fact that I had served in the P.O.U.M. militia was quite enough to get me into prison. It was no use hanging on to the English notion that you are safe so long as you keep the law. Practically the law was what the police chose to make it.\\" <br /> <br />Orwell wrote \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" seven months after he escaped from Spain.  By then he had time to consider the politics of the war from a distance and relate what he had seen and heard from people who never experienced life on the front-line of a war.  The parts of the book in which he addresses these people are the most fascinating.  In several of these passages Orwell writes of how he came to the realization that many of the people driving the Marxist ideas he once supported were every bit as dishonest and treacherous as the right-wing Fascists he always hated.  As he writes of the press covering the war, \\"One of the dreariest effects of this war has been to teach me that the Left-wing press is every bit as spurious and dishonest as that of the Right.\\"  Orwell's scorn extends beyond the left-wing press to wealthy English travelers through Spain at the time who were obliviousor apathetic to the widespread misery around them.  Writes Orwell, \\"Some of the English visitors who flitted briefly through Spain, from hotel to hotel, seem not to have noticed that there was anything wrong with the general atmosphere. The Duchess of Atholl writes, I notice (Sunday Express, 17 October 1937): 'I was in Valencia, Madrid, and Barcelona... perfect order prevailed in all three towns without any display of force. All the hotels in which I stayed were not only \\"normal\\" and \\"decent\\", but extremely comfortable, in spite of the shortage of butter and coffee.'  It is a peculiarity of English travellers that they do not really believe in the existence of anything outside the smart hotels. I hope they found some butter for the Duchess of Atholl.\\" <br /> <br />It must have been hard for Orwell to come to terms with the fact that many people he once supported were no less repugnant than his enemies.  When faced with such a situation, human beings have a natural urge to deny or make excuses for what they are seeing or hearing, for whatever their reasons.  It is hard for people to admit when they are wrong, especially regarding something they care deeply about.  Orwell faced this situation, and he chose honesty over ideology.  Sadly, many of his contemporaries did not.	2005-01-10

Aikman breaks his book up into several sections devoted to topics such as the Chinese church patriarchs, the slightly less influential but still very important church \\"uncles,\\" famous Chinese Christian women, the roots of Christianity in China, how Christianity is influencing different artists, musicians, and others contributing to present-day Chinese culture, and most controversially, the debate between the government-approved churches of the Three Self Patriotic Movement and the \\"underground\\" house churches.   <br /> <br />While Aikman is clearly more favorable to the side of the house churches and their leaders, I do believe he was fair to Bishop Ding, the leader of the government's Three Self Patriotic Movement.  While it can be argued that Ding has done much to advance Christian freedom in China, Ding also made statements in the past that go beyond simple respect for Chinese law... statements that were clearly pro-Communist.  Ding also at times has professed a theology that is beyond liberal to a point that is simply not Christian.  Ultimately, it is somewhat telling that Ding never spent a minute in prison while so many other Christians during Mao's reign, especially church leaders, were being brutally beaten and imprisoned for years at a time. <br /> <br />Aikman sides at the end of the book with Chinese Christians that are critical of far right American groups (including some Christians) that seem only to want to exploit Chinese government abuses (which are indefensible) in order to shut off US contact and trade with China.  He supports the Christians who believe that China is making progress, even if it has a long way to go.  He clearly believes with these Chinese Christian moderates that the worst thing the US could do would be to intentionally antagonize and isolate the Chinese government.  So Aikman does understand that there is a reactionary element running in some Christian groups, both inside and outside of China, but he also realizes that there is something suspicious about Christians that are too comfortable with what is still a totalitarian, often repressive, Chinese government as well. <br /> <br />This book isn't the most exciting read as there are several typos, and Aikman's writing is fairly dry.  But he has done his homework, he clearly cares about the people of China, both Christian and non-Christian, and he does a good job here of introducing the key players and laying out the background behind a fascinating movement occuring in a country that could very well dominate the 21st century, for good or bad, as much as America dominated the last century.	2005-01-01

Lewis & Aldous Huxley	Books	3	24	24	N	N	Good introduction to an important debate.	In \\"Between Heaven and Hell,\\" Peter Kreeft sets up a fictional debate between C.S. Lewis, Aldous Huxley, and John F. Kennedy, shortly after their deaths which, amazingly, all came on November 22nd, 1963.  Kreeft uses Lewis, Kennedy, and Huxley as representatives of 3 common worldviews and their interpretation on Christianity: orthodox Christianity, modernist Christianity, and \\"Orientalist\\" Christianity, respectively. <br /> <br />Kreeft, an orthodox Catholic, naturally sides with the general worldview of the Anglican Lewis over the modernist Catholic Kennedy and the Buddhist Huxley, but Kreeft is fair and respectful towards Kennedy and Huxley.  While the book is very short at only a little over 100 pages, in informal, conversational format, it provides a good synopsis of how the three men interpreted the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, as told in the New Testament. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is Lewis debating Kennedy on the subject of Christianity.  (Huxley agrees to listen and argue his philosophy later on, mainly against Lewis of course, which he does in the 2nd half of the book.)  Kennedy's worldview is definitely the most prevalent in the present-day, Western world, and therefore, the debate between Lewis and Kennedy will be the more interesting of the two for most readers raised in a Western culture.  The Lewis-Kennedy debate is basically a summation of several Lewis books, most of which were themselves an argument for orthodox Christianity versus the modernist Christian and post-Christian worldview.  Lewis handles Kennedy fairly easily, and Kennedy fans or readers sharing Kennedy's worldview will probably find themselves wanting to propose several objections to Kreeft in support of their side of the debate.  But this is a quick summary after all, and Kreeft is obviously aware of that. <br /> <br />Moving on to the pantheist Huxley, the debate becomes slightly more foreign and rare to the average Westerner used to debates between monotheists and atheists.  Huxley was a brilliant man (as all three were, of course), and his philosophy was deep, well-argued, and at times, abstruse.  Kreeft uses this debate to answer the question often put to Christians, phrased in one form or another, \\"How is Jesus different than other major religious gurus?\\"  This debate, again being a quick summary, leaves a few pantheist arguments on the table and isn't ended as easily as the Lewis dispatching of Kennedy's case is, but it suffices. <br /> <br />I recommend this book as a good introduction to the believing Christian's argument against modernist Christianity and Eastern philosophy.  The book is entertaining and can be read in a couple hours, if not less. <br /> <br />	2004-12-31

Despite its annoying title, \\"How the Scots Invented the Modern World\\" is an enjoyable book and a good summary of the Scottish Enlightenment.  Its author, Arthur Herman, doesn't make the case that the Scotch \\"invented the modern world\\" any more than several other nations can claim to have \\"invented the modern world,\\" but Herman also doesn't truly attempt to argue such a case either, to his credit.  Instead, he gives a good summary of Scotland's history and the contributions that many Scotch and people of Scottish descent have made to human progress. <br /> <br />At the beginning of the book, Herman gives a quick but sufficient summary of Scotland's pre-Enlightenment history, focusing primarily on its union with England to form Great Britain in 1707 and the Jacobite revolt of 1745, the unsuccessful attempt by France, in cooperation with Highland Scots, to restore the Stuart dynasty to the English throne.  With the solidification of the British union after the \\"Forty-five,\\" Scotland truly began to make its monumental contributions to science, economics, medicine, philosophy, commerce, and numerous other fields at the foundation of modern Western culture. <br /> <br />One area where Herman should have expanded his focus is on the extent that Scottish Presbyterianism laid the groundwork for the Scottish Enlightenment.  While Herman does note that the Enlightenment in Scotland differed from the Enlightenment in France in that the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment saw progress and Christianity as completely compatible, if not necessary, he fails to look at why the Calvinist philosophy prevalent in 18th Century Scotland (and therefore, much of 18th Century North America) would encourage an environment so friendly to human progress.  Despite what Herman seems to believe, the Scottish Enlightenment did not happen in spite of the Calvinist Presbyterian culture from which it came but largely because of it. <br /> <br />In the final chapters of his book, Herman tells the stories of 19th Century Scotch migrations to America, Australia, India, Africa, and several other areas where the Scottish Enlightenment would leave its imprint.  It's in these chapters that the book's title seems less the obvious exaggeration that it is.  Thanks to these migrations, the teachings and discoveries of Adam Smith, David Hume, Francis Hutcheson and the other notables of the Scottish Enlightenment eventually did have a monumental impact on many of the most powerful nations in the world today.	2004-11-26

The Penguin edition is just over 600 pages and can be very slow for a modern-day reader, but it is worth the effort as much of it is still amazingly practical, especially in today's wartime world.  Unfortunately Thucydides' account ends 7 years before the end of the war (which Sparta won, but in a rather Pyrrhic victory) so be prepared for some disappointment at the conclusion of a long read.   <br /> <br />The narration of the book is rather dry at points (which is understandable in that it was written 2400+ years ago), but Thucydides' summations of the major speeches at high points of the war are excellent.  His recap of the speech made by the Athenian general Pericles, appealing to his people for continuation of the battle at a point when their morale was very low, reads like it could have been taken from a present-day newspaper within the past few years. <br /> <br />Be prepared to have to give some effort to get through this book, but you'll be better off for doing so.	2004-08-15

Chernow is a talented writer and keeps the book flowing steadily, making a rather lengthy book interesting throughout.  He is definitely a fan of Hamilton and throughout the book he makes a case that Hamilton, due to his death at a young age leaving his opponents years to tarnish his image, has been unfairly downplayed from his deserved status in American history.  Chernow's case is strong, and it is hard not to finish this book with a negative impression of Thomas Jefferson's and John Adams' behavior towards Hamilton during and after his life.  <br />Hamilton's life was inarguably fascinating.  Hamilton was born into a poor, broken family in Nevis and raised by a mother constantly plagued by relationship and financial problems (many of her own making).  It is a testament to how hard a worker Hamilton was that he rose from such a lowly situation to become one of the most powerful men in the early days of the United States.  Moving from Nevis to New York as a teenager, Hamilton obtained a law degree from King's College (now Columbia University).  Along with his reknowned skills as a lawyer, his marriage to Elizabeth Schuyler, from a wealthy Albany family, helped cement his rise from poverty into the upper ranks of colonial America.  From there Hamilton would go on to be a top aide to George Washington in the Revolutionary War and later one of Washington's most trusted advisers, becoming America's first Treasury Secretary.  Hamilton used this position to bring a struggling collection of states into one capitalist financial system that would become the foundation of the greatest economic power the world has ever known.  While doing this, Hamilton, a proud New Yorker, also established himself as the person most responsible for New York's being the economic capital of the world today.<br />Chernow does put too heavy a gloss on Hamilton though.  Hamilton's involvement in an extra-marital affair with an illiterate wretch of a woman, with the consent of her nefarious husband who used the relationship to blackmail Hamilton for financial gain, was shockingly stupid for a man of Hamilton's intellect and abilities.  Chernow acknowledges as much but seems to downplay the seriousness, both personally and professionally, of the relationship.  Hamilton's eventual public confession of the affair lead to his adultery's often being used against him by political opponents, which while not necessarily fair or moral of them either, should have been expected.  Chernow excoriates Hamilton's opponents for having done so while only mildly owning up to Hamilton's role in the matter.  Chernow also brushes over Hamilton's having held or transfered slaves via the Schuyler family, despite his being a staunch abolitionist.  While Hamilton definitely did much to fight against the spread of slavery and is to be commended for it, he was still stuck in a culture where slavery was prevalent.  Rather than just admitting that Hamilton likely oversaw slaves in his home at times in his life, however infrequently, Chernow fights very hard to spin away an item from Hamilton appearing to show his having purchased two slaves.  This stretch by Chernow leaves his slightly excessive demonizing of Jefferson looking a bit biased, if not hypocritical.<br />Most biographers come to love their subjects and tend to paint the prettiest portrait of them that is possible, if their subjects are at all likeable, as Hamilton definitely is.  Knowing this, Chernow can be forgiven his downplaying of some of Hamilton's character flaws, especially given that the book in its entirety is a very interesting, extensively-researched summary of a life whose public works produced an impact that is still being felt around the world today.	2004-06-19

Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" was first published in 1987, but 16 years later it is still the best parody of the political and social scene in New York City.  Combining his everyday, \\"fly-over country\\"-style conservatism with his keen wit, Wolfe lays out a story that sends characters crashing into one another from all socioeconomic levels across the Big Apple.<br />Sherman McCoy, a stereotypical, ego-maniacal bond-trader, is Wolfe's typical protagonist.  The main plot starts when McCoy and his mistress, Maria Ruskin, take a wrong turn returning from Kennedy airport one night, leaving them lost in a bad neighborhood in the Bronx.  This is where they cross paths with Henry Lamb, a seemingly innocent kid stuck in a sad world, and Roland Auburn, a neighbor of Lamb's and local drug-dealing hoodlum.  In their haste to escape from a neigborhood within their city but light years from anything they recognize, Sherman and Maria strike Lamb with their car, critically injuring him.  Once a struggling NYC journalist learns of the story, it becomes a perfect case for the politicians, media, and attorneys to latch on to for their own selfish gain.  From there the Lamb case blows up into an ordeal beyond anyone's control, but one that could only descend into such madness in New York.<br />Wolfe's writing is funny, entertaining, and searing.  Through his fictional characters, he presents the perfect condemnation of the ridiculous excesses found in some NYC political and social circles, with specific real-life examples coming naturally to any reader's mind.	2003-11-06

I was expecting more of a book on Christian answers to common Muslim challenges.  Instead, I found myself reading a book that is simply an introduction to some areas of Islam and the Muslim world that any Christian (especially Western Christians) should know, yet a book that is very light on apologetics.<br />One of the things I really respected about this book was the obvious care and love Samuel Zwemer had for the souls of Muslims.  Many Christians in the public forum today take an approach to Islam that is either too watered down in its Christian theology or one that seems to care for nothing but theological consistency but comes across as too cold.  Zwemer's approach would be a great guide for either of these extremes as he had a great balance which he demonstrates in the writings that make up this book.  Zwemer is respectful of Islam's beliefs and history without giving into them or exaggerating them (for good or bad) either.  He acknowledges errors in Christianity's past (calling the Crusades &quot;a collossal error on the part of Christendom&quot;), yet makes no apologies for the life and teachings of Jesus Christ and what he has called Christians to do. <br />The major focus of the book is explaining to Christians what Islam teaches about Jesus Christ and which traits of Christianity and Jesus Christ that Muslims can relate to as well as which ones are their &quot;stumbling blocks&quot;.   One of the more interesting chapters of this book was the one discussing animism and how deeply it is ingrained in Islam and the various Muslim cultures around the world.  As Zwemer puts it, &quot;Islam, far from delivering heathendom from the toils of animism, is itself deeply involved in them.  Animism emerges from its struggle for the soul of a people, elegantly tricked out and buttressed by theology.  Often it is scarcely recognizable in its refined Arabian dress, but it continues as before to sway the people; it has received divine sanction.&quot;  That is a fascinating but very clear way of explaining the difficulty in speaking theologically with a devout Muslim that any Christian who has done so will recognize.  It's easy to see from Zwemer's explanations in this book that Western Christians are going to have to go before the Lord and pray that He will give us the wisdom to be able to understand and speak effectively to people that could have such beliefs, despite everything we in the West have come to take for granted about science, our world, and our God.<br />Any Christian following events of our times can easily see that the next big spiritual battle in this world will be between Islam and the remaining believers in Jesus Christ left in this world.  I honestly believe we are the last possible hope to counter the evil running rampant in the Muslim world and spreading like wildfire even beyond its historical boundaries in the Middle East (i.e. into Western Africa, South Asia, etc.), and the American military, as great as it is and as much respect as I have for it, can only do so much.  In this book Samuel Zwemer, years ahead of his time, laid out the situation that he correctly saw was coming, and addressed it perfectly, writing: &quot;The sword destroys human life; the cross gives it priceless value.  The sword deadens conscience; the cross awakens it.  The sword ends in hatred, the cross in love.  He who takes up the sword perishes by it.  He who takes up the cross inherits eternal life.  In winning Muslim lands for Christ, the call is for men and women who will today follow the way of the cross with the same courage and abandon with which soldiers served their countries.&quot;	2003-08-08

Jonathan Edwards is one of the greatest thinkers in American history, and while \\"Sinners in the Hand of an Angry God\\" has become his most famous work, \\"The Freedom of the Will\\" is his best.  Two and a half centuries after Edwards wrote it, this book is still the premiere and most thorough argument for the complete sovereignty of God.<br />\\"The Freedom of the Will\\" is a challenging read and might be too hard for people new to the debate between Calvinists and Arminians.  It would take too long to outline the entire argument Edwards makes or recap every point he touches on, but what follows are some examples of the ideas and questions raised by Edwards in this book.<br />1)  It is alleged by Arminian belief that a person or action cannot be morally good (or bad) if the agent performing the action is incapable of doing otherwise.  But can God be evil?  The Bible teaches that He is not only holy, just, and perfect, but that He knows everything that has happened and everything that is to come.  So can He do or be evil, or is His will and nature necessarily determined to be perfectly good?  If God is capable of doing evil, and not necessarily good, then how can He assure us that He will be perfect for all eternity (if one day, He might choose not to be)?  And if He is necessarily determined to be perfectly good forever and cannot be otherwise, does this make God any less holy, perfect, and morally virtuous?  As a corollary to this, if He is no less praise-worthy by being necessarily holy, are we, as fallen human beings born into sinfulness, any less blame-worthy if we are necessarily inclined to evil, incapable of willing what is truly good?<br />2)  Another area Edwards focuses on is discussing the Arminian contention that the will actually is free.  Edwards takes this idea on by challenging what exactly is meant by the will, and therefore our actions, being \\"free\\".  His reasoning would lead to questions along these lines: If a starving man is placed at a table with an appetizing pizza on his right, and an utterly foul concoction (insert your own horror) on his left, is he really free in what he wills to eat?  What could possibly make this man choose to eat what was on his left rather than the pizza, other than some overriding, external threat?  The only way this man might choose what was on the left, barring the overriding threat, would be his will being utterly indifferent to the two choices, and in this case, what kind of man would this be?  (Imagine him eating the concoction with no care in the world, much as human beings so often can be seen going about sinning.)  <br />Now, say humans were deceived and fell into a state where what appeared to be appetizing to us was really what made us sick whereas what was truly holy and good, appeared as unappetizing to us as the horrible concoction.  (This deceptive state is what we fell into with the Fall of our original parents through their sin.)  What would ever make us will to eat that disgustingly wretched concoction on the left?  Even after we've tried it and seen how wonderful it is despite how it may appear to our sinful natures, we still go back to the poisonous pizza of sin over and over again.  (And whereas the pizza and the concoction of this analogy are so clearly different, sin and God's holiness are infinitely more opposite to each other.)  Why do we continue returning to what makes us sick?  Why do we continue to see these things as beautiful and appetizing while the holiness of what God has commanded appears so unattractive? Someone says, \\"Just eat the nasty thing... you know it is good for you, ignore its appearances,\\" and I cry out, \\"But I just can't!\\" (Or, as the Apostle Paul put it, \\"What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?\\" - Romans 7:24))  Not only can't I eat what is so repulsive to me, but in actuality I don't want or will to, whereas I will to eat the \\"pizza\\" because I delight in my sins.  It is only by some supernatural changing of my heart and mind that I will ever choose what is truly holy and good.  But, oh, how wonderful to know that there is someone who makes this change for us, contrary to our corrupted will.<br />These questions touch on just a few of the topics concerning the human will and God's sovereignty that Jonathan Edwards discusses in \\"The Freedom of the Will\\".  I've heard it explained that the Calvinist doctrine on these matters is like a candy with a hard exterior but a soft, delicious center, and I believe that's an accurate way to put it.  With this book, Jonathan Edwards comes as close to helping Christians break through that hard exterior as any man ever has.	2003-07-15

Lewis' auto-biographical book about the early, formational years of his life, which began with a vaguely religious upbringing, led into devout Atheism, and ended in Christ's drawing Lewis home.  This book is excellent as auto-biographies (Christian or non-Christian) go as C.S. Lewis was one of the 20th Century's best story-tellers and an amazingly well-read professor at Oxford as well.  Whether the reader is a Christian or not, C.S. Lewis makes this story entertaining and thought-provoking.<br />For those readers who have come to believe in Jesus Christ as Man's only possible salvation, this book will leave them marvelling repeatedly at how Christ works in the lives of those he calls.  Any Christian reader of &quot;Surprised by Joy&quot; will find numerous similarities in the path C.S. Lewis' salvation took him down, and a Christian reader can't help but want to join him in praising Christ for his awesome goodness in the lives of human beings he touches.  <br />One fascinating element in C.S. Lewis' life, which is so encouraging for Christians in a post-Christian era, is that Lewis was raised by brilliant men to be constantly curious but always logical... always seeking the truth.  One of the men Christ used the most in saving C.S. Lewis was a staunch Atheist; a dry, pensive, professor who demanded a rigid adherence to logic in any belief or action.  This man, the &quot;Great Knock&quot;, as Lewis, his brother, and their father called him, was so influential in Lewis' mental development that Lewis devotes a whole chapter (&quot;The Great Knock&quot;) to discussion of him.  How fascinating that whereas many today believe a rigorous pursuit of knowledge and facts leads to agnosticism, in the life of the greatest Christian apologist of the 20th Century it led to a belief in the sovereignty of Jesus Christ.  <br />This is a book that I would recommend to anyone, but as &quot;a must&quot; to any Christian.  While &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; is C.S. Lewis' best-selling book, and arguably has initiated more paths to Christ than any other book outside the Bible, &quot;Surprised by Joy&quot; presents a more complete understanding of those paths and their ultimate result.	2003-07-05

Hayek, is one of the greatest arguments for economic, political, and social freedom written during the 20th Century.  Published in 1944 as an assessment of what went so wrong in Western Europe as to allow the rise of Hitler and National Socialism, Hayek also perfectly forecast the disaster and horrors of Communism that would follow for the next several decades.<br />In this now famous book, Hayek breaks down the different ways in which state planning, as opposed to individual or more localized control, nearly always means the loss of liberty.  Ultimately, in an economic system planned from the top down, should the system seek to continue, it will require dreadful, totalitarian measures.  One of the saddest facts of these systems though is that in order to be put into place, they require many once-free people to willingly give up their freedoms: \\"the totalitarians in our midst\\" Hayek labels them.  One passage along this line that holds just as true today as when Hayek wrote it:<br />\\"And, undoubtedly, not merely the ideas which in Germany and elsewhere prepared totalitarianism but also many of the principles of totalitarianism itself are what exercises an increasing fascination in many other countries.  Although few people, if anybody, in England would probably be ready to swallow totalitarianism whole, there are few single features which have not yet been advised by somebody or other.  Indeed, there is scarcely a leaf out of Hitler's book which somebody or other in England or America has not recommended us to take and use for our own purposes.  This applies particularly to many people who are undoubtedly Hitler's mortal enemies because of one special feature in his system.  We should never forget the anti-Semitism of Hitler has driven from his country, or turned into his enemies, many people who in every respect are confirmed totalitarians of the German type.\\"<br />For anyone who has wondered recently why Pat Buchanan can often be seen receiving large applause at rallies with ultra-Leftist labor union leaders, or how other fringe Right groups often march these days against international free trade along side of socialist/environmentalist groups, F.A. Hayek explained it perfectly nearly 60 years ago.  Whether seeking to force a large group of people to pay excessive amounts for goods and services, through trade protectionism supposedly planned to \\"protect\\" the jobs of a much smaller group, or through more directly stated taxation and redistribution of wealth programs, these groups are both taking a page from the Russian and German totalitarians of the 20th Century.  Often \\"mortal enemies\\" of each other, they have found common cause at the modern-day economic forums, and should a free American people ultimately hand them control, as the Germans gave to these groups' National Socialist forebears, then similar results would ultimately not be far behind.  (And if you think there weren't numerous leftists in strong roles in Hitler's National Socialist party, you need to read this book that much more.)<br />\\"The Road to Serfdom\\" lays out just what the title implies.  F.A. Hayek was a brilliant thinker who was sadly dismissed by many of his day.  Hopefully, more leaders of our era will read this book and realize that economic planning, be it through protective tariffs or progressive tax rates, while such an easy sell and so tempting at times, lead only to a loss of freedoms for everyone (as economic freedom is at the base of all the others), including the people they are supposedly intended to help.receiving large applause at rallies with ultra-Leftist labor union leaders, or how other fringe Right groups often march these days against international free trade along side of socialist/environmentalist groups, F.A.

Victor Hugo's \\"Les Miserables\\" is a classic tale set in early-19th Century Paris, in which the lives of several colorful characters cross paths, seemingly randomly, and are each changed dramatically from contact with these others.  \\"Les Miserables\\" is a short glimpse at how people's actions have direct results on the lives of others, and how God works in these actions for the ultimate good.<br />The novel begins by introducing us to the life of the elderly priest, Monseigneur Bienvenu, an utterly humble and Christ-like man who gives everything he has, including his heart and spirit, to the people he comes in contact with, yet doing it all in testimony to the grace of Jesus Christ.  Bienvenu's spirit is what allows him to change the heart of the hardened criminal, Jean Valjean.  Valjean, so impressed by the grace shown to him by Bienvenu, embarks on a life of repentance and noble actions. In time, he crosses paths with Fantine, the single mother of Cosette, whom Fantine has had to place in custody of the Thenardier family, being unable to care for Cosette herself.  It is out of desperation (a state initially brought upon herself by her own poor choices) that Fantine is forced to leave her daughter with the Thenardiers who, unbeknownst to Fantine, are thoroughly evil people.  As Hugo puts it: \\"There are human creatures which, like crayfish, always retreat into shadow, going backwards rather than forwards through life, gaining in deformity with experience, going from bad to worse and sinking into even deeper darkness.  The Thenardiers were of this kind.\\"<br />Out of kindness to Fantine, Valjean sets out to rescue Cosette from the slavery which she has been left to.  But by this time, Valjean is being tracked by the cold, legalistic, Javert, an inspector seeking to arrest Valjean for parole violations stemming from the crimes of his earlier days.  This sets up a novel of lives on courses that cross with dozens more, with countless twists and turns of the roads on whicheach character is travelling.  What the reader encounters is a fascinating example of how simple meetings of \\"chance\\" can often lead to radical re-workings of one's entire outlook on the world and the people around him; of the ways in which these events and introductions can entirely alter how one's life plays out.  Ultimately, it is a story that presents numerous challenging questions concerning God, grace, and predestination, or in other words, our sovereignty... or His:  \\"He could see two ways ahead of him, and this appaled him, because hitherto he had never seen more than one straight line.  And the paths led in opposite directions.  One ruled out the other.  Which was the true one?\\"	2003-06-15

She's wants one thing: victory over the Islamists by any means necessary. There comes a time when arguing with evil in its purest form does nothing more than legitimize this evil. If a society cannot stand up and call this evil out, to its face (and yes, evil has a face in this case), then that society is either: 1) as good as dead , or 2) a friend to that evil.<br />In \\"The Rage and the Pride,\\" Oriana Fallaci uses her eyewitness account of the 9/11 attacks on lower Manhattan, New York City, to launch into a rant against radical Islam and its proponents' repeatedly stated intentions to conquer the world. Ms. Fallaci takes on the European Muslim leaders and their total condonation or, at best, acquiescence to the vitriolic, hate-filled rhetoric coming from some of the leading mosques and Islamic scholars in Europe and around the world. She directly attacks Yasser Arafat for the terrorism he wages against not only the civilized world but against his own people, while running up a personal net worth of an estimated $300 million. Ms. Fallaci, a lifelong Leftist and true \\"libertarian\\" is a great example of how the International Left should have reacted to 9/11 and the rise of Radical Islam. Instead, much of the Left, with the cowardice that Fallaci rips them for in this book, can only mount tepid condemnation of democratic, Western leaders that pose no threat to them, while excusing and turning a blind eye to those that seek to kill us all, no questions asked.<br />The Rage and the Pride is not well-composed and not well thought out. But it is a better read just for those reasons. It is an emotional roller coaster of anger and passion that laughs at the thought of continued diplomacy and debate with the Islamists and their dictatorial protectors in Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and so on. Anyone who values enlightened, democratic, freedom will love this book and have a profound respect for Ms. Fallaci's rage. Anyone who does not is simply not with us. They're with them. Period. And Oriana Fallaci knows how true this is.t is simply not with us. They're with them. Period. And Oriana Fallaci knows how true this is.	2003-03-02

I agree with Thomas Merton's introduction to the latest Modern Library version, which says that an uninitiated reader of Augustine may wish to read his \\"Confessions\\" first to get a good background on the author. \\"The City of God\\" is long and deep, covering many philosophical and Biblical debates (many that are still alive today), so one who has been introduced to Augustine through his auto-biographical \\"Confessions\\" may find it easier to follow his logic as he discusses the numerous topics of \\"The City of God.\\"<br />The first few hundred pages of \\"The City of God\\" may be very slow and difficult for the average modern, Western, reader. Augustine is speaking directly to the average Roman citizens of the time (413 AD), so the first several chapters of \\"The City of God\\" are spent debunking the Romans' beliefs in polytheism, a mindset long since abandoned by most in the civilized Western world (thanks mostly to... Augustine). But the difficulty of these first few chapters should only make one appreciate Augustine all the more for having helped dismiss such a convoluted belief system. Once Augustine has broken down the problems with Zeus and friends, he moves on to discussing Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers. Augustine discusses why these founders of Western culture came close to understanding the idea of the Judeo-Christian God, but he shows where they too eventually fell short of total comprehension of Him. <br />After Augustine has dealt with these religions and philosophies of the Romans, he begins to address the Bible and how it concerns the City of God and the earthly city (Rome, which had been sacked by Alaric in 410, was the best example of the latter). Augustine outlines the differences in the beliefs and actions of believers and non-believers, or in other words, the citizenries of the two cities in question. In doing this, Augustine discusses numerous debates and questions, including figurative vs.literal interpretations of Old Testament stories, how the Old Testament prophets pointed towards Jesus Christ and how Christ fulfilled their prophesies, as well as many other questions that are still discussed every day, nearly 16 centuries later. Ultimately, Augustine gives us the beautiful picture of life graced by Christ through the faith he gives to the citizens he elects to join his city. Augustine shows us how Christ's grace removes his predestinated citizens from the worries of the earthly city, while (paradoxically) energizing them to care that much more for the inhabitants of this city (as the Christians in Rome did for non-believers they sheltered from Alaric's invaders). <br />One note of recent relevance: The City of God is often referenced today for Augustine's discussion of \\"just war\\" theory. While Augustine definitely believed that war can at times be just, and therefore morally obligatory, he does not really go into great detail about \\"just war\\" theory in \\"The City of God.\\" In nearly 900 pages (in the Modern Library edition), he writes about war for no more than 1-2 pages. <br />I highly recommend \\"The City of God\\" to everyone, Christian or not. Just for the history of it, this book is fascinating, but the theology makes it one of the greatest works ever written.	2003-03-02

Valladares was arrested shortly after Fidel's revolution, simply for not placing a Marxist slogan on his office desk, that would have required him to deny his Savior, Jesus Christ. Several days after this refusal, his house was stormed in the middle of the night, and he was hauled off to prison in Havana, with his mother promised that he would be returned shortly thereafter. Valladares didn't see her in freedom until 22 torturous and terror-filled years later.<br />The greatest thing Armando Valladares has done for the free world is to shatter the myth (CNN and Jimmy Carter, not withstanding) that Fidel Castro's Cuba is a semi-free place, persecuting only a handful of capitalists and subversives. Valladares tells story after story of hundreds (among tens of thousands of others) of prisoners he knew personally, who were tortured, maimed, starved, and executed. Scores of these prisoners Valladares came to know were not upper class or \\"white\\" but poor \\"campesinos\\" (and many black Cubans), many of whom once fought for Fidel Castro and Che Guevarra's Revolution... only to have that Machine of Death turn and kill them as well. <br />After nearly 400 pages of death and terror at the hands of Fidel Castro and his minions, I found myself wanting to just close the book and forget the rest. But then, I realized that's what the United Nations (ah, what a noble-sounding title that is) and the Western elitist Left has been doing for years with Castro... ignoring his terrorism. Ultimately, I was glad I finished the book, because even though Valladares does not put some lame happy spin on the story, he is at least freed (22 years of his life stolen), and now he can openly speak the truth of his Savior, to Fidel's power.	2003-02-09

Well then... what would you do?	\\"The Threatening Storm\\" is a rather lengthy book in which Kenneth Pollack lays out the reasons why the United States (and others) have come to the final possible solution to saving the world from Saddam Hussein.  Pollack is very fair (criticizing or complimenting both the Right and the Left, Democrats and Republicans) and thorough in dealing with how Saddam came to power, what he's done since then, what's been done in attempt to stop or contain him, what he is attempting and could eventually do, and what options the United States and its allies have left.<br />The most respectable characteristic of this book is the palpable regret with which Mr. Pollack has come to the conclusion that the only good choice the U.S. has left is to invade Iraq to remove Hussein.  While many on the anti-war side will seek to target Mr. Pollack personally, attempting to find ulterior motives, there just simply aren't any.  Pollack clearly hates the fact that we have come to this, as any civilized person does.  But after laying out all the things we have tried: sanctions, embargoes, bombing runs, etc., etc... there just simply isn't any other option left, in his expert opinion.  Saddam Hussein is actively working to acquire a nuclear weapon, already has smaller chemical and biological weapons, and is looking for every chance he can get to throw the Middle East and the rest of the world into chaos.  Mr. Pollack goes into great detail in explaining how he has done and is doing this, as well as giving numerous facts and details as to how waiting any longer will only make the situation for us and the rest of the world... so much worse.  <br />The crowds opposing the U.S. led removal of Saddam Hussein from power have their roots in the same Left-wing ideologies (as well as a few of the fringe Right) of the leaders that opposed stopping Hitler in 1938.  These ancestors of today's Left won the debate in 1938.  Millions died soon after because of their victory.  Now we are facing a similar situation... and the Left is again clamoring to let Saddam Hussein go on murdering.  This is not to say all that oppose the war are of these groups; some that are opposed are very logical, honestly informed and well-intentioned.  But the Noam Chomskys of the world simply have none of these traits.  Bill Buckley put it well in a recent interview by explaining that people that are opposed to war under ANY circumstance (as these people are) just simply don't believe America is worth fighting for (and driving one's Range Rover to the local college campus rally is not what is meant by \\"fighting\\").  Read the anti-American diatribes coming from some of these folks and their underlying vitriol becomes readily transparent.  Kenneth Pollack did not write this book for these people.  He wrote this book for the general public, and most specifically, for the people that will begin this book with a skepticism and doubts that are genuine and honest, not jaded and cynical.  A reader in this position may not be convinced, but he will respect Mr. Pollack's sincerity and seriousness, at the very least.	2002-12-30

Henry James's, &quot;The Bostonians,&quot; is a simple, but increasingly entertaining love story set in the years soon after the end of the Civil War.  Basil Ransom, a true Southern gentleman from Mississippi, has moved North (specifically, to New York City) to try and start a career away from the impoverished South of the Reconstruction days.  Shortly after moving North, he pays a visit, at her behest, to the Boston house of his distant cousin, Olive Chancellor.  Olive, a stalwart in the women's rights movement of the time, invites Basil to her home in order to offer help and assistance to her Southern cousin, but she also wishes to save him from the flawed ways he certainly must have taken on growing up in the South.  Her self-seeking, ulterior motives fail miserably, of course.<br />It is through Olive that Basil Ransom meets Verena Tarrant, the young woman who has left her lower middle-class family to move in with and be molded by Olive.  Verena has a tremendous speaking ability which caught Olive's (and the other women's (womyn's?) movement leaders') attention.  But ultimately, Verena also catches Basil's attention... not for her feminist diatribes, but for her beauty and the passion of her speeches.  Basil is instantly struck by Verena, and from this point onward the plot focuses as Basil attempts to seek out his love interest who is highly guarded by Olive, Verena's parents, and several others.  <br />The dialogue between Olive and her friends with Basil Ransom, is a constant back and forth that is civil on the surface, but boiling with hostility underneath the social niceties.  While Basil is always cool and focused as he tracks the object of his love, Olive Chancellor only becomes more paranoid as she sees that she is gradually losing her young charge... to a Southern Neanderthal.  &quot;The Bostonians&quot; meanders through the first couple hundred pages with witty dialogue between the alien Basil and his new peers, but as his focus intensifies, so does the plot.  James draws all this circling and stalking into a final, climactic scene that many will be cheering, but one that many modern-day feminists and their sympathizers will be cursing.	2002-12-10

I'd seen &quot;All the King's Men&quot; described as one of the best American political novels, and after reading it, I don't see it as a political novel whatsoever.  While it is based around the rise and fall of the fictitional Southern politician, Willie Talos, it is really just the story of the narrator, Jack Burden.  Robert Penn Warren uses Burden to tell the story of Willie Talos and those around him but the novel ultimately ends up being just an insight into the relationships and emotions of Burden, which aren't too different than many that would be experienced by any modern-day American.  At times, Burden's storytelling drifts far away from the topic that launched it, but Warren's writing is so pretty and the scenes described are so picturesque, that the drifting is enjoyable.  While this also makes the book a slower read, it is more entertaining for being so.  The novel is generally somber though, as life in the poor, early 20th Century, rural South could be, but the characters of the novel are very endearing.  Their lives, intertwined with that of the man that has attracted them to him, rise with Talos' successes but are also doomed to crash with him and his all-or-nothing style.  But while Talos is the protagonist, the most important parts of this book are those that focus on Jack Burden's life, especially the beautiful narrations he gives of his early-life memories.	2002-11-13

Devine's account of Scotland from 1700-2000 is the most up-to-date review of Scottish history over the past three centuries.  Mr. Devine covers every aspect of the development of Scotland and Scottish life over that time period.  On many topics such as religion, immigration/emigration, government, cultural traditions, economics, and much more, Mr. Devine presents a thorough analysis.  I was hoping for more details on Adam Smith, David Hume and other figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, but Mr. Devine chooses to stick with the story of Scotland as a whole for this work.  This is a slow read at times, but for those genuinely interested in knowing more about the modern history of Scotland, this book has to be as good as one will find.	2002-10-20

While much has changed over the last three decades in America regarding the topic of race, the essays of this book are just as applicable now as they were when Wolfe wrote them.  <br />\\"Radical Chic\\" is the story of a party thrown by Leonard Bernstein to raise money for the Black Panthers; specifically, for their legal defenses.  Wolfe lets their own words and actions at this typical party be the objects by which these elite, Manhattanite, \\"limousine liberals\\" completely humiliate themselves.  The lengths to which the Bernstein crowd goes--from whom they employ to what they wear--to remove anything that could possibly be viewed as \\"intolerant\\" is simply comical to almost anyone except for this crowd.  As one who currently lives in New York City, this book was hilarious to read since any differences between the crowd Wolfe satirized in 1970 and the Manhattanite left-wing elitists of today, are virtually non-existent.  As \\"Radical Chic\\" closes, this crowd is sent scrambling to distance themselves from the Panthers, not because the Panthers were anarchist street thugs, but because they are shown to be virulent racists, especially regarding anti-Semitism.  Upper class Leftists, scrambling to distance themselves from the anti-Semitic comments of black leaders they once supported politically... my, how things have changed.<br />While \\"Radical Chic\\" is the longer and usually more famous of the two essays, \\"Mau-mauing the Flak Catchers\\" is Wolfe writing at a better, more colorful level than in \\"Radical Chic\\", where the essay's subjects do most of the talking.  In \\"Flak Catchers\\" Wolfe again takes on the topic of angry minorities and their more affluent supporters in the white community.  This time, Wolfe uses the racial melting-pot in San Francisco to show the numerous \\"impoverished\\" groups uniting to make themselves seen and heardby the local government.  Wolfe demonstrates his perspicacity in putting a human face on these groups and objectively showing their personal motives for giving the white government office workers (the Flak Catchers), an occasional shakedown.  But here too, Wolfe is not commenting on the minority group nearly as much as he is on the white, middle class, Northern Californians that seek to appease these groups at any cost.  His cynical view of these people comes not from disagreement with their wanting to help the less fortunate, but from their complete phoniness, which ultimately blinds them to the acts and words of some nefarious characters.  <br />As Wolfe writes in \\"Flak Catchers\\": \\"You'd turn on the TV, and there would be some dude you had last seen just hanging out on the corner with the porkpie hat scrunched down over his eyes and the toothpick nodding on his lips--and there he was now on the screen, a leader, a 'black spokesman,' with whites in the round-shouldered suits and striped neckties holding microphones up to his mouth and waiting for The Word to fall from his lips.\\"  <br />Exactly.	2002-08-28

Oscar Wilde's \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an entertaining, short novel, with a very honest moral to it.  A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with.  Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead.  In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic.  As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.<br />Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic.  This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies.  Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\"  For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra.	2002-08-12

Almost too objective.	\\"Six Days of War\\" is a good book (but not great) that is written with a military historian's tone.  Michael Oren has a long history in the Israeli government and with the IDF which will lead many to instinctively shout that the book must be biased per se.  But for such a contentious topic, Oren does a great job of giving as unbiased an account as possible of the Six-Day War and the events that led up to it.  <br />The book is really only about 350 pages, with nearly 150 more of notes and bibliographical information concerning interviews and other works cited by the author.  Most of these 350 pages, nearly the entire first half of them, deal solely with the tug-of-war diplomacy between the United States, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and the Soviet Union that dominated the weeks before the eventual beginning of the battles.  This is where Oren's hyper-objectivity, although necessary, starts to sap the life out of an otherwise exciting and historically momentous time.  But Oren gets through this long lead-in and then rapidly recounts the major events of the quick war in fairly thorough detail.  Its with recounting these military tactics and strategies that Oren is clearly at his best.<br />This book is a well-researched account of a war that radically changed the balance of power in the Middle East, and Oren should be applauded for being as objective (to a fault) as humanly possible.	2002-08-04

Over the 4-week period it took me to read &quot;War and Peace&quot;, I was asked several times by friends and co-workers who saw me with the book why it was so long.  At first, I really didn't have a good answer although I felt I knew why.  Having finished it, I would tell them that its length is due to its being a very thorough novel covering almost every aspect of life in general.  This could be said about several books obviously, but in &quot;War and Peace&quot;, Tolstoy covers human life more thoroughly than, although maybe not as well as, any other book I've encountered.<br />&quot;War and Peace&quot; lets us follow along in the daily lives of several land-owning class characters from early 19th Century Russia.  The Bolkonsky and Rostov families comprise most of these figures, but their friends and acquaintances take up nearly as much of the focus of Tolstoy's classic novel.  These characters cover a wide range of personalities from the devoutly religious Maria Bolkonsky and her close and conflicted friend Natasha Rostov to the independent Pierre Bezuhov and his miserable wife Helene Kuragin.  Tolstoy is able to go in and out of his creations' lives with simplicity and without exaggeration, whether its in relating the most common moments of their daily lives or the climaxes of their earthly existences.  The range of emotions, feelings, and actions that Tolstoy is able to relate is easily done through his genius in setting the story in the midst of Russia's War of 1812 (the history of which he knew very well), one of the worst in its long history.  It's through such a life-shattering event that people can be seen everywhere from their best to their very worst, and Tolstoy, through a compelling story line and the novel's famous length, displays the entire spectrum.<br />I still love Dostoevsky's writing more, mostly because of the difference in the conclusions his characters come to in their cathartic moments, but &quot;War and Peace&quot; gave me a much greater respect for Tolstoy than I had previously held (having read Anna Karenina, among others).  I definitely recommend taking the time to read this classic.respect for Tolstoy than I had previously held (having read Anna Karenina, among others).

Closing this book and setting it down on my desk, I feel that it should be one of the most depressing books I've ever read, and to many it may be.  Happily, it's one of the most encouraging.  Wow, how great this book is!<br />Bonhoeffer's letters begin shortly after the time of his arrest in Berlin in the Spring of 1943.  The letters in this collection are mainly those written to his parents and his associate (and husband to his niece) in the German Confessing Church where he was pastor, Eberhard Bethge.  At first these letters are fairly basic and simple reassurances of his well-being and encouragements to his friends and family.  There is not simply a hope that he will be released from the Tegel Interrogation Prison where he was being held, but an almost naive expectation that his release will be soon.  Gradually, with time, Bonhoeffer clearly begins to see the truth of his imprisonment and the reality that he'll probably only be freed upon the defeat of Germany and liberation by the Allied Forces.  But it is with this realization that Bonhoeffer's letters become stronger, more passionate, more philosophical, and simply more powerful.<br />Anyone could forgive Bonhoeffer for having become depressed, bitter, and hopeless during his horrendous, Kafkaesque, imprisonment.  But amazingly, his spirit is lifted in the opposite direction as his detention carries on.  People can debate what the cause of this irrational hope and joy was due to (although Bonhoeffer never appears delusional; rather, very grounded), but Bonhoeffer himself makes it clear throughout that his hope and strength is due entirely, in his belief, to Jesus Christ and His Holy Spirit.<br />Eventually, after many letters and papers filled with short stories, poems, pastoral sermons, and theological debates, Bonhoeffer's letters become shorter, less frequent, and more direct, due to the closing of the war and his implication (among hundreds) in the assassination attempt on Hitler on July 20, 1944.  But even in these final letters, he is positive and encouraging to his family.  Finally, Bonhoeffer's letters stop, and we know from other sources that he died one of the most miserable deaths imaginable, via executionary hanging in the Flossenburg concentration camp, as the Nazis, sensing their downfall, began to eradicate every witness to their crimes.  But from his letters we can know what Bonhoeffer would have told us upon learning this: \\"Death is the supreme festival on the road to freedom.\\"  Someone who can write that and truly mean it (i.e. not in some hypothetical sense), is either a complete fool, or knows something that many others do not.  I believe with Bonhoeffer, the latter applies.	2002-07-10

Listening to Mr. Greenya talk, although he was a rather dull and unorganized speaker, I had hope that his book would be as neutral a biography as possible. Mr. Greenya was very open in acknowledging that the Right and Left are very passionate when it comes to Clarence Thomas and that there is rarely any middle. This is true, but Mr. Greenya made it seem that he may be one of the rare few capable of standing in that middle ground. Sadly, he's not.<br />The book opens on the very first page with the view of Thomas's confirmation hearings through the perspective of the porn-store owner that alleges to have sold videos to Judge Thomas. Greenya writes that this owner was \\"excited\\" that one of \\"his customers\\" was being nominated to the Supreme Court. Yeah... I bet.<br />After that wonderful introduction, the book truly begins with Thomas's impoverished childhood in Pin Point, Georgia. Mr. Greenya moves quickly through this time period, as well as most of Thomas's young adult and college days. The majority of the 300-page book is taken up by quotes and opinions on Thomas, mostly concerning the Anita Hill ordeal and Thomas's rulings as a Supreme Court Justice. In these cases, the quotes opposing Thomas are without fail longer and preceding the quotes from the far fewer sources Mr. Greenya uses who are on Thomas's side. Mr. Greenya even goes so far as to uncritically reference the words of people such as Nan Aron and Eliot Minceberg of People for the American Way, an ultra-Left lobbyist group.<br />Mr. Greenya does not seem like a vindictive or vitriolic man, like many (not all, of course) of the people who attack Clarence Thomas for anything he does. But he is clearly slanted to a certain political side not in agreement with Clarence Thomas's views. In prefacing the lengthy passage he uses from Sarah Weddington, the lawyer who successfully argued theRoe v. Wade case, Mr. Greenya characterizes her as \\"a fierce protector of the right she worked so hard to win for all American women...\\" Political opinions aside, it is simple fact that there are tens of millions of American women who do not consider legalized abortion to be any \\"right\\" that human beings have, no matter what the law says... rather, they consider it morally appalling. In this simplistic statement Mr. Greenya gives away his political persuasion more than he does at any other point in this book. His explanation of what it means to \\"bork\\" a judge is also astoundingly false, according to the widely held understanding of the word, even as defined by Microsoft's Encarta dictionary, for one. Mr. Greenya almost seems to be painfully twisting things to meet an agenda at times.<br />I give the book 2 stars because Clarence Thomas rejected several requests, rightfully so, by Mr. Greenya to be interviewed for this book. I'm sure Judge Thomas's friends and fellow conservatives also knew what to expect and turned down Mr. Greenya as well, which had to be a major factor, beyond his control, in Mr. Greenya's lack of qualified, pro-Thomas sources throughout the book. But the slant and the errors are simply inexcusable in a purportedly neutral book, and accompanied with a boring narrative, this makes for one of the worst \\"biographies\\" I have ever read.	2002-06-30

Ecc. 1:2	Ernest Hemingway took the title for his classic \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" from Ecclesiastes. The characters and themes of this book make Ecclesiastes the perfect pretext for anyone about to read \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"<br />Hemingway's novel is a simple novel featuring several acquaintances and a few weeks of their lives spent mostly in Spain watching bullfights and Pamplona's now-famous Running of the Bulls.  The characters are very human and in their conversations Hemingway shows the reader their numerous faults.  They are lazy, selfish, untrusting, often drunk, and very shallow.  Through each other they distract themselves from finding any deeper meaning in their existences.  So they drink, admire the beautiful scenery in Spain, and watch bullfights.  Like the repetition of life and death in the bullfights they frequent, the characters half-heartedly attempt to solve their problems and only find subsequent troubles replacing those they do manage to slay.<br />\\"Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done<BR>   and what I had toiled to achieve,<BR> everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;<BR>   nothing was gained under the sun.\\" -- Ecc. 2:11<br />Hemingway has created these characters to be endlessly frustrating and seemingly beyond hope, but in doing so he makes them approachable, captivating, and people that every human being can relate to.  \\"There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.\\" -- Ecc. 7:20<br />\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is probably Hemingway's greatest work, and it's main theme is even sadder when viewed in relation to his suicide.  With this book, Hemingway left humanity a beautiful work of art, truly worthy of its classic status... but in taking his life, he showed us a very logical end result of characters such as these.  Bright, lovable, passionate, and utterly hopeless.  <br />\\"...for without Him, who can eat or find enjoyment?\\" -- Ecc. 2:25	2002-05-20

The book is approximately 500 pages long (with several pages devoted to press clippings, government documents, etc.), but the majority of these pages is dedicated to the story of the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.  This clearly is what Thomas originally meant for the book to focus on, as most of his research and interview subjects come from the Tiananmen ordeal.  Thomas sandwiches the several hundred pages concerning Tiananmen in between introductory and concluding segments that relay his investigative reports on such topics as the Los Alamos espionage case, the activities of the Mossad relating to theft of American intelligence, and the fairly recent American spy plane downing in China.  Only in the final few pages of the book does Thomas attempt to tie Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban to the Chinese government, and even then, he makes no direct tie between China and the September 11th massacre which is Bin Laden's ultimate feat to date.<br />My feelings on this book ranged from highly incredulous to thoroughly fascinated.  I found some of Thomas's sources to be seriously flawed, including the woman (an admitted sufferer of multiple personality disorder) who has written to Thomas accusing the CIA of crimes such as having \\"placed her in an adult-sized gyroscope and spun her to split her personality further\\" as well as having \\"forced her to perform in bestiality films, to be sold on the black market.\\"  Even Maxine Waters would shy away from accusations as far-fetched as those.  By including this lady's letters to him, Thomas makes his claims of sordid American and Israeli espionage that much harder to believe, since most of it can only be documented by Thomas as having come from anonymous intelligence sources.<br />The best part of the book, which Thomas should have limited the topic to, was the Tiananmen Square massacre account.  This is the heart of the book and Thomas's witnesses to the demonstrations and subsequent slaughter were on the scene early, very involved, and highly credible.  His research included many trips to China to meet with numerous documentable sources which included Chinese citizens and foreign press that covered the story.  The writing in this section of the book is also more colorful, less repetitive (although excessive use of certain phrases is a problem throughout), and more passionate.  Contrasting this part of the book with the hastily added, 2001-till-current day, conclusion shows where Thomas's original inspiration for writing this book was.  Somehow, even White House Senior Advisor Karl Rove made it into this sloppy addendum as \\"Carl Roe\\".  <br />Overall, \\"Seeds of Fire\\", for its in-depth, emotionally personal retelling of the events and politics that led up to the Tiananmen Square massacre, is a very entertaining book.  Thomas just should have known better and left the peripheral Hollywood spy-drama accounts on the editing room floor.	2002-03-30

In Beyond Good and Evil, Friedrich Nietzsche lays out his philosophy through a collection of his thoughts on various different issues including: women, nations, religion, and many other fundamental aspects of human life. While the book may seem jumbled and random at times, as it is Nietzche's thoughts given in a non-linear manner, the reader will finish with a solid understanding of Nietzche's philosophy. He truly was the father of post-modernism, and the world we live in today, on the average, has a belief system much more in line with Nietzsche than with any Biblical beliefs. In other words, for the most part, Nietzsche was right in saying that \\"God is dead\\", and the 20th Century, as we got beyond good and evil, clearly crowned Nietzsche the new king.<br />At the same time, Nietzsche is much more honest and direct than most intellectuals of our current, post-modern age. To demonstrate, here's Nietzsche (from Beyond Good and Evil): <br />\\"They discover, these acute observers and idlers, that the end is fast approaching, that everything around them is corrupt and corrupting, that nothing can last beyond the day after tomorrow, one species of man excepted, the incurably mediocre. The mediocre alone have the prospect of continuing on and propagating themselves -- they are the men of the future, the sole survivors; 'be like them! become mediocre!' is henceforth the only morality that has any meaning left, that still finds ears to hear it. -- But it is difficult to preach, this morality of mediocrity! -- for it can never admit what it is and what it wants! it has to speak of moderation and dignity and duty and love of one's neighbor -- it will scarcely be able to conceal its irony!\\"<br />So, if it feels good, do it (be mediocre!)... but what is this silliness about also preaching moderation, dignity, love, etc, as these same modern cultural intellectuals do? If truth is completely subjective, as they clearly state in their \\"feel good\\" philosophy , then why do they justas strongly believe that moderation, dignity, and love are \\"good\\", a statement of objective truth itself? As Nietzsche says of the philosophy of these hypocrites, \\"...it will scarcely be able to conceal its irony!\\"<br />This is a great book, that will challenge anyone to think about the prevalent worldview of the modern, Western elites and the world we all live in.	2002-03-03

In the book Twain travels through France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Russia, Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt, among others.  This is Mark Twain, early in life, at his very best.  <br />Contrasting this with his autobiography, &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot; is equally witty and comedic, but with Twain's patented cynicism being far less jaded than it would become at the end of his life.  Twain's Biblical knowledge is impressive and surprisingly respectful as he recounts his travels to European cathedrals and later, multiple Middle Eastern holy sites.  At the same time, his mistrust for many of the people in power and living in these lands, particularly the Middle East, is truthful and direct in a way that our hypersensitive modern world does not allow people to be.  Twain's account of the Arab world was just as accurate then as it would be today, over 130 years later.  His assessment of the mess their culture had created, especially in regard to the utter wasteland that was pre-Israeli state Jerusalem, is cuttingly accurate but brilliantly comical in typical Mark Twain fashion.  <br />This book is one of the best non-fiction books I've read in a long time.  Mark Twain was truly a great American, and every patriot will enjoy following him on this trip around the world and may come away with a greater appreciation of all that Americans have.	2002-02-23

Several passages, in fact, are taken nearly verbatim from previous Buchanan lectures.  What may be new to many readers though is his in-depth summary of global birthrates and population numbers.<br />Buchanan's assessment that Western culture and the nations built upon it are in trouble can be broken down into two main factors: shrinking populations and a cultural collapse.  While the Right and the Left will debate the status and morals of modern Western culture, what is not debatable are the population numbers.  The fact that all European nations (except Moslem Algeria) as well as Australia and Westernized Japan are facing rapid population decline is solidly supported by simple mathematics.  Even the United States, which announced this week that the year 2000 saw its largest birthrate in 30 years, has a rate barely high enough to sustain its population at the present number.  This also, is not a dispute between conservatives and liberals.  Vladimir Putin has already told his country that it is inevitable that Russia will have 15,000,000 less people by 2015.  The European Union has taken out ads in several major European newspapers encouraging its citizens to have more children.<br />Buchanan takes these numbers (courtesy of the UN Population Division), as well as the statistics from the booming populations of Africa, China, the Arab States, and Latin America, and expands them out over the next 50 years.  For many, this results in a forecast that will be simply scary.  <br />Buchanan is over-the-top and a bit heavy handed in some areas, and his fiery rhetoric is offsetting to many, in our politically correct modern world, who might otherwise side with him.  But while the moral issues he addresses and the tactics he uses create polarizing debates, I would recommend this book to those on all political sides simply for his demographics summary.  Thesenumbers, which will be getting more and more attention in the years to come, need to be looked at by everyone and will hopefully not be ignored simply because Pat Buchanan has taken the forefront in addressing this issue.	2002-02-15

Scott Peterson's bravery in reporting these events, which most of the civilized world simply ignored, is admirable.  At the same time, his finger-pointing is overwhelmingly in the direction of the U.S. and the U.N., and it becomes tiresome.<br />The book is broken into 3 sections focusing on Peterson's experiences in the war zones of these countries: Somalia, Sudan, and Rwanda.  The section on Somalia provided a great background and lead-in to the events recently made famous through Mark Bowden's \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"  The Sudan chapters gave me a deeper insight into the most widely ignored African country at war in the 1990s, but disappointingly, Peterson's focus was mainly on the in-fighting between Christian factions in southern Sudan, despite the fact that the Muslim government in Khartoum (which sheltered Osama Bin Laden for years) is clearly most responsible for the horrendous slave and murder industry that still exists in Sudan to this day.  Finally, Peterson's discussion of Rwanda is easily the most depressing and convicting when one considers what the U.S. and U.N. failed to prevent.  <br />Obviously, the United States and the United Nations (specifically its Western members) are worthy targets of some blame for failure to act and, possibly, for criminal behavior in some acts when intervention was attempted.  But Peterson's focus is so lopsided in the direction of these governments that it almost seems he has forgotten who the actual perpetrators of the massacres were.  It reminded me of a quote I read recently from a Western diplomat who was frustrated with the amazing ability of the international media to find moral equivalency between the West and the most murderous, tyrannical regimes: \\"They equate our imperfections with their evil.\\"<br />Peterson provides the perfect example of this.  Despite giving accounts of the most horrific murders and evils performed by Somalian warlords, Peterson harps incessantly on American and U.N. imperfections, even claiming: \\"If brought before an international court, UN forces in Somalia would almost certainly have been found guilty of violating the laws of war.\\"  Reading that, I can only wonder of what Somalian warlords, who machine-gunned the women and children of their own country in order to prevent the success of U.N. airdrops of food, would be found guilty.  Moral equivalency...<br />Again, in Rwanda, the overwhelming objects of Peterson's criticism are the United States and the Clinton administration, the latter of which I was no fan.  But the guilt in the United States' failure to intervene and stop the Hutus' genocidal massacres of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994, while sad, is simply not morally comparable to what these Rwandan murderers did.  Peterson seems to have lost sight of this fact.  <br />One story, for sake of example:  several Belgian U.N. troops were dispatched to try and stop the killing of the Rwandan prime minister, a woman.  When confronted by the advancing Hutus, these U.N. troops laid down their weapons in hopes of preventing an annhilation of both sides.  In return, their Achilles tendons were eached hacked with machetes to prevent their escape.  They were then castrated and gagged with their own genitalia, then killed along with the prime minister.  One could scan the entire list of atrocities perpetrated by Americans throughout their country's history, and it would take a serious stretch to equate the very worst of that list to this one event in Rwanda, which occurred less than 8 years ago.  Even then, those far-stretched incidents would be extreme anomalies, whereas this event was, and is, very close to the norm in Rwanda and many African and Muslim countries.  Moral equivalency...<br />This is a well-written, courageous book full of facts and events that depressingly few Americans know anything about, but it is sadly tainted by yet anothermember of the mainstream American and European media who is unable to differentiate between the imperfections of our leaders and societies... and the utter evil at the very core of theirs.  For those of you hoping or thinking that the United States and its allies will decide once and for all to put an end to these evil regimes (Sudan and Somalia, as well as Syria, Iraq, the Palestinian Authority, etc., etc.), look no further than this book for a good example of why our leaders will continue to balk at taking the necessary (and morally justified) steps to do so anytime in the foreseeable future.	2002-02-11

Bias is Bernard Goldberg's shot at the mainstream media machine that chewed him up and spit him out after he came forward in a Wall Street Journal editorial and wrote what many already take for granted.  What he wrote, that the mainstream news media is overwhelmingly liberal, is no new accusation, but what is unique is that Goldberg himself is a self-described liberal who worked 30 years in the heart of the CBS news department.<br />This book is interesting mainly for the story of how ruthless his friends at CBS were after he criticized their organization following one exceedingly vicious attack piece CBS news (supposedly just reporting the &quot;news&quot;, remember) did in a nightly news feature on Steve Forbes and his presidential campaign of 1996.  Even if Goldberg could be easily dismissed (which he cannot be) as having had some grudge as motivation for writing the editorial, the overreaction by his workmates and superiors at CBS would be simply comical, were it not so pathetic.  Read the book, if only for this funny, yet sad, story.<br />After recounting the string of events that led to his willingness to write this book, Goldberg, who meets all the criterion for a self-labeled liberal (pro-choice, anti death penalty, pro tax, never voted for even one GOP presidential candidate), goes on to give some examples of where the media empire is liberal to a point now beyond its own control.  Breaking the book into chapters for each topic, Goldberg gives examples he believes prove the media's leftward slant on issues such as homelessness, AIDS, terrorism, and crime.  <br />If you believe there is a liberal bias in the mainstream news organizations, then you will simply love reading this book and it will give you lots of numbers, stories, and quotes for your argument.  If you believe the major, broadcast networks are generally unbiased, or even have a conservative bias (although I've never really heard an argument for this contention), then this book will probably anger you, but read objectively it will give you a good summary of what your political opponents are alleging.  Read the book, and it'll help you counter the arguments made by the man who will now be used frequently as the conservatives' greatest weapon.	2002-01-20

But after reading some of the reviews here, I felt it necessary to give mine for those of you thinking about purchasing this book.<br />The Jungle begins with a compelling storyline about a Lithuanian family struggling to survive in the brutal world that was turn-of-the-20th Century Chicago.  It is clear from the beginning that Sinclair, a very politically active Socialist, wrote the book for more than just the sake of telling a story.  The motive was to give an inside look at the ugly scene that were most early 20th Century slaughterhouses.  This book sparked outrage and led to increased protections of workers' rights as well as the creation of some very necessary food regulations and inspection requirements.  For that reason, Sinclair's work should be appreciated, but as for the novel itself... it's a dud.<br />While the first part of the book compels the reader to sympathize with its main character, Jurgis Rudkus, and his family, Sinclair's exaggerations of the evils of the upperclass bosses, coupled with the excessive victimization of Rudkus and his family become tiresome.  Long after the reader has been given the general picture (unforgiving system, unfair bosses, etc.), Sinclair piles tragedy after tragedy on top of the Rudkus family as the story spins its wheels.  Finally fed up with it all, Rudkus abandons his loved ones, in search of himself and a better life in the rural American countryside.  Begging and stealing to survive, Rudkus is nevertheless painted as the unfortunate hero in Sinclair's story.  Eventually, after a year of wandering, Rudkus returns to Chicago to try his luck in the system again (I still don't know why), but finds that very little has changed.  Finally he meets his calling after learning of the joys of socialism and joining the glorious Brotherhood.  At this point the reader is treated to numerous pages of Sinclair's praises of socialism, given through a worker that takes Rudkus under his wing.<br />Read some of the other reviews here, and it's not hard to see they are in praise of the book not as much for its literary aspects but for its far-left, anti-corporate (my, how things change) political stance.  In all fairness to Sinclair, the book sparked some necessary legislation, and it was also written a few years prior to the Russian Revolution which, along with others in the 20th Century, would eventually demonstrate the inevitable outcome of socialism and its ideological friend, communism.<br />So if you are one of those that is still trying to find a way to make these systems work on a large-nation scale and you don't mind a monotonous storyline, then this is the book for you and you'll be back here soon after reading it with your own 5-star review.  If you've spent any time on Earth in the last few decades and 375-page, thinly-veiled manifestos aren't your thing, this one will bore you to tears.lism and joining the glorious Brotherhood.

Entertaining	Christopher Hitchens is often wonderful to listen to, while at other times he can be aggravating.  But he presents his opinions directly, honestly, and intellectually, and this makes him entertaining... always.  <br />In this short book, Hitchens gives his thoughts on what it means to be contrarian.  He advises his audience on why it is often important to stand contrary to the mainstream, and he gives numerous examples to support this argument.  Hitchens' writing is witty, and all readers will find several areas of agreement and disagreement with the author, but whatever the degree to which one agrees with Hitchens, it is impossible to argue that he is not thought-provoking.<br />Several reviewers here believe Hitchens to be contrarian simply for the sake of being contrarian, but this is not the case, and he actually cautions the reader several times not to be contrarian simply for argumentitive reasons.  Hitchens follows his own advice, and this is best demonstrated in his discussions of religion.  Despite the oft-cited polls (another item Hitchens lambastes), most people in our secular modern world do not truly believe in any religion.  Many will say they are members of a certain religion, but the slightest interrogation never ceases to fail in demonstrating that very few have more than a shallow understanding of what their respective religious books have to say.  Instead, in today's world, all religions are usually twisted and distorted into something that is convenient or much easier to believe.  So in his disbelief and general distrust of all (not just Christianity) religions, Hitchens is not contrarian.  What is contrarian though, is his refusal to make apologies for this stance.  Christopher Hitchens does not take several religions and pick and choose the parts he likes (as does the Hollywood crowd), he does not make some lame explanation about being &quot;spiritual, not religious&quot;, he does not claim to be &quot;...still a Christian, though&quot;, nor does he take the religion in which he was raised and distort it (i.e. the &quot;that one is just a story... oh, but that one there actually happened...&quot; defense).  Quite simply, and very easily, he dismisses them all, and defenestrates respect for their leaders as well.  And THAT is contrarian.<br />I highly recommend this book, even though it comes from an author with whom I have multiple disagreements.  It is a quick read, but it is thought-provoking and encouraging.  Above all, any honest reader will appreciate Hitchens' refusal to make excuses for popular figures such as the Dalai Lama and Bill Clinton.	2001-12-26

It is the story of Billy Pilgrim and his problematic life marred by his horrific experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden during World War II.  There, Billy experiences firsthand the catastrophic fire bombing that leveled the German city.  The reader jumps back and forth to different points in Billy's life, many times randomly and unexpectedly.  All of it adds up to a darkly (yet humorously) told story of a sad, existentialist life.<br />I must say that I, as a Believer, have a different worldview than Kurt Vonnegut and Billy Pilgrim.  But this book is so very honest about what everyday human life must mean if there is nothing more than fire bombings, dogs barking, family members, dreams of trips to imaginary planets, and so on.  If what we see is all there is, as many of us, with our actions and beliefs testify to frequently, well then, as Vonnegut writes, &quot;...so it goes.&quot;  The only thing we can do to cope is deny the fact and create our own subversions, unless we truly want to open ourselves up to something our very nature tells us from which to run.<br />&quot;So..&quot; said Billy gropingly, &quot;I suppose that the idea of preventing wwar on Earth is stupid, too.&quot;<BR>&quot;Of course.&quot;<BR>&quot;But you do have a peaceful planet here.&quot;<BR>&quot;Today we do.  On other days we have wars as horrible as any you've ever seen or read about.  There isn't anything we can do about them, so we simply don't look at them.  We ignore them.

The Lord of the Rings is much more in depth, descriptive, and more entertaining than the Hobbit, but it also includes several references that only one who has read the Hobbit will fully understand.<br />The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins and his journey away from his comfortable home in Hobbiton and across Middle Earth in order to defeat the Dragon Smaug.  Bilbo travels with 13 dwarves whose homeland has been taken by the evil dragon, and their journey is aided by the wizard Gandalf who has chosen Bilbo to join the dwarves in their quest.  The Hobbit is a fairly simple story in which Bilbo and his new friends encounter many dangers and hardships along the way, but most importantly, it is the story in which Bilbo finds the Ring that will eventually be the centerpiece for Tolkien's subsequent classic.<br />Read The Hobbit to enjoy a quick story that will give you the background and introduction to Hobbits and Middle Earth that will make reading The Lord of the Rings much more enjoyable.	2001-11-23

I am on the opposite end of the spectrum as Friedman, politically, so I was not expecting to agree with him on every view and suggestion for solution that he describes in this book, but his writing was entertaining, his stories amazing, and his opinions very fair to both sides.  <br />The book begins with Friedman's description of life in the middle of the Lebanese civil war.  Friedman lived in the heart of Beirut when it was the worst place anyone could be at the time.  His firsthand stories of bombings, murders, and simple terrorism, range from unimaginably scary to darkly humorous.  Eventually Friedman and his wife move from Beirut to Jerusalem, where the second half of the book begins.  This second part is much more applicable to today's news and debates since it is from an area in the middle of daily battles, whereas Lebanon's civil war has died down.<br />Friedman, although Jewish, has many misgivings about Israeli actions in their conflicts of the past several decades.  But unlike most of his workmates and friends at the New York Times, Friedman is also not afraid to tell the whole truth when detailing Arab atrocities.  Friedman's account of Hafez al-Asad's massacre of his own people in the town of Hama, Syria, is one that should be read by every Westerner -- especially those on the left who think the Jews, aided by America, simply &quot;stole&quot; a small plot of Arab land from an otherwise friendly group of people.<br />This book won many awards and is very unique in that it is a wide-ranging report from the world's greatest newspaper's leading foreign affairs writer.  Many may dislike Friedman for his controversial views, (i.e. saying the famous Elian/machine gun picture brought joy to his heart), but in &quot;From Beirut to Jerusalem&quot;, heis very honest and comes as close to playing the middle ground as is possible in a dispute that seems to have no middle, and will likely never end.	2001-11-03

Milton's descriptions are so filled with color and emotion that I felt like I could see this celestial event taking place in front of me.  &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is the story of Satan's fall from grace, God's subsequent creation of Earth and Man, and Satan's deadly corruption of God's masterpiece.  Not only was Milton's writing so legendary but his respect for Scripture was equally admirable.  <br />&quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is a foundational work of Western Culture that should be read by every western citizen, if only for the finale in which Adam is taken up a hill near Eden by Michael, the arch-angel, and shown the future of the world.  Standing there he sees the world with a view that modern man loves to deny:<br />&quot;...I had hope/When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,/All would have gon well, peace would have crownd/With length of happy dayes the race of man;/But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see/Peace to corrupt no less than Warr to waste.&quot;<br />While this scene is a fictional scenario, it is an ingenius way for Milton to not only express the despair and guilt that Adam must have felt, but to tell the reader of the Hope that God would restore to Adam's race through His Son.  This is the theme of Milton's wonderful poem.	2001-10-16

The novel is typical Faulkner, as it is told through the minds of each Bundren family member and their neighbors.  Each chapter is short, usually only a couple pages, but is filled with colorful, emotional descriptions from its respective narrator.  Even Addie gets the chance to give her thoughts through an odd, posthumous account of how her family began, that reveals what an unhappy woman she was.  Often, Faulkner's &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; is graded higher than &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; by literary critics, but I enjoyed this one more than the former.  Faulkner's characters and stories are frequently hard to follow, but if one sticks with them, he or she will come away with a painting of life in the Southern United States that is unrivaled by any other artist.	2001-09-23

Josef K., the accused, battles throughout the book to gain insight into his immensely frustrating and confusing situation, but every bit of new information leads to closed doors and more confusion.  &quot;The Trial&quot; is the personification of Kafka's bleak view of life and the human situation.  Read this book, if only for the priest's tale at the novel's close of the man who seeks admittance into the Law.  It is a story within a story, the profoundness of which rivals Dostoevsky's &quot;Grand Inquisitor&quot; from &quot;The Brothers Karamazov.&quot;  This is a great book that the average reader will consume in a couple nights.	2001-09-10

If you approach Joyce's Ulysses looking to be told a story worthy of the Modern Library's #1 book of the 20th Century, then you will most likely be disappointed.  But if you throw aside your expectations of what makes a book great and just read the words as you would the people, places, sights and sounds that trigger your thoughts during the course of a normal day, then you will be amazed.<br />In Ulysses, James Joyce uses his superhuman vocabulary and literary knowledge to relate a day in the life of a couple Irishmen (Stephen Dedalus and his friend, Leopold Bloom) and the people with whom they interact.  Joyce's words are abnormally sophisticated, yet one never gets the feeling he is simply showing off.  While his writing style is often referred to as stream-of-consciousness, it is clear that every word is appropriately placed and deeply thought out.  As Ulysses meanders along through its day, the objects that enter the periphery of the protagonists triggers emotions and thoughts that lead to: poems, songs, theological and political discussions, laughing, shouting, incoherent noises, etc.  The novel ranges from sublime to aggravating, but that is only because it is so true to its form.  How many times in a normal day, if we were to stop and ruminate upon what we were just thinking, would we then think, &quot;What was that?&quot;  But then it's quickly on to the next interaction destined to spark different emotions, thoughts, ideas, etc...<br />It is impossible to sum this book up.  It follows no plot or pattern other than that it is simply 1 day.  A few people... 1 day.<br />Reading this book reminded me at times of the Simpsons episode where Homer is seen watching an episode of David Lynch's Twin Peaks.  &quot;Brilliant!&quot; Homer remarks, but then quietly to himself, &quot;I have no idea what is going on here.&quot;  While I often found myself in Homer's predicament while reading Ulysses, I was always able to appreciate Joyce's writing, even if the individualwords were all I understood.  For that reason, I plan on reading this book again several years from now to see what life has taught me that might expand my understanding of Joyce's beautiful day.	2001-09-04

This book would seem to be nothing more than a sad story of life in a poor country's ward for terminally ill cancer patients.  But through the interaction and description of the doctors and patients in Solzhenitsyn's brilliant novel, especially the loveable protagonist Kostoglotov, it becomes apparent that the ward is the Soviet system in a microcosm.  With that understanding, this becomes one of the most scathing indictments of a totalitarian state written in the 20th Century.  Even Orwell's great novels were not as passionately and directly damning of the Evil Empire.  <br />This is a very typical Russian novel in that the setting is very stationary, the plot is slow moving and not well-defined in many parts, but it is also psychologically deep and gives the reader an immensely profound look at the minds and souls of its characters.  But what separates this from so many Russian novels, especially those of the 20th century is that it slams the Communist regime while taking a bleak, Dostoevsky-like view of man as well.  Kostoglotov's experiences at the end of this book are not as cathartic as those of Dostoevsky or Tolstoy characters, but the hope that he has is clearly the same in that it stems from a source greater than him or any man.  This is an emotionally challenging book and the interpretation of the ending is divisive (just read some reviews here to see both opinions), but that just adds to the genius of this book.  I believe the ending is phenomenally beautiful and Solzhenitsyn at his best.<br />This is a classic that is unfairly dismissed by today's modern, Western, intellectual elites, but its historical significance is undeniable.  This book along with a few others inspired the anti-Soviet movement in the U.S., its allied countries, andthe democratic revolutionaries inside of Russia in their eventually successful quest to destroy the most murderous empire our world has ever seen.  <br />&quot;Two things he liked: a free life and money in his pocket.  They were writing from the clinic, 'If you don't come yourself the police will fetch you.'  That's the sort of power the clinic had, even over people who hadn't got any cancer whatever.&quot;<br />God bless Alexander Solzhenitsyn.	2001-08-09

Tocqueville had originally set out to study the U.S. prison system but what he saw inspired him to write about much, much more.  <br />The foresight he had for such a young man is really impressive to read 160 years later.  What he saw in the morals, work ethic and government structure of the United States led him to accurately predict many of the ways in which the U.S. would lead and has led the world.  At the same time Tocqueville was not oblivious to many of the ills in the America he saw.  He very wisely writes of the cancer that the institution of slavery was to not only all black Americans, but to the white, Southern farmers and workers as well.  <br />I hate having to give these books &quot;stars&quot; for ratings because in many cases it takes away from the ultimate importance and classic status of a book like this one.  Tocqueville does tend to jump around and venture off into different topics that don't fit with the rest of their chapter, which could be attributed to his youth.  Also, a few of his predictions, naturally, were way off.  A native Texan, I had a good laugh at his view that &quot;the province of Texas is still part of the Mexican dominions, but it will soon contain no Mexicans.&quot;  But overall Tocqueville's view of America was honest, accurate, and the perfect explanation of why, on a daily basis, people continue to risk their lives to gain the freedom that only the United States of America offers.	2001-08-04

As the notes progress, the narrator becomes even more frustrating, yet honest, to the reader.  As one wants to hate what he says, the way he acts, and the views he has of the men and world around him, any honest reader will agree that they, at times, harbor some of, if not all of, the resentments and animosity that this wretched man does.  At the same time, Dostoevsky uses his creation's words to make a mockery of the illogical, &quot;lofty&quot; views of man that many of his &quot;progressive&quot; contemporaries were espousing.  <br />My favorite sample from the Underground Man's notes:  <br />&quot;...I'll demand to be respected, I'll persecute whoever does not show me respect.  I live peacefully, die solemnly--why, this is charming, utterly charming!  And I'd grow myself such a belly then, I'd fashion such a triple chin for myself, I'd fix myself up such a ruby nose that whoever came along would say, looking at me: 'Now there's a real plus!

This book, dictated by Twain when he was near the end of his life, covers a wide range of emotions.  <br />   Twain explains at the start of the book that he approached his auto-biography as though he were composing it posthumously in order that he might loose himself of normal inhibitions which would otherwise force him to hold back on his opinions of certain people and beliefs.  The result of this style is a very witty and frank retelling and analysis of many private and not-so-private moments from Twain's amazing life.  <br />   This book obviously took Twain on an emotional journey of many highs and lows.  These range from the hilarious scene in which he tries to reassure his wife that they are safe, even as a burglar rummages around in the lower portion of their house one night, to the extremely sad, but boldly colorful accounts of the deaths of several people very close to Twain.  <br />   In the end, though I enjoyed the book, I have to say I felt sad for Mark Twain.  While I love his writing and think he is unfairly persecuted and misunderstood in today's politically correct world, Twain was not a very happy man at the end of his life, despite being at the pinnacle of his artistic field.  His candor about his lack of faith in man or God is very honest but ultimately disappointing as it offered him, admittedly, no personal hope in anything greater than his difficult end to a very full life.  I definitely recommend this book though for a look at an American icon that only could have been relayed by Twain himself.	2001-07-18

And it was necessary as well.  After several years of books and articles from Reagan opponents in the mainstream media, Michael Deaver simply wanted to set the record straight on the personal beliefs and characteristics of a man he served for many years.  That being his stated goal, he did a very quick but effective job.<br />   He efficiently counters all the negative Reagan psycho-babble that has come from several sources recently such as Edmund Morris's Reagan biography, &quot;Dutch.&quot;  As one who read that book (and I actually thought Morris was criticized excessively on both sides), it was very refreshing to have someone who knew Reagan much better than Morris set the record straight with facts that only one who was there could have.<br />   The Reagan haters, and other cynics, will definitely find this book sycophantic and unconvincing.  But the thing that struck me most about the book, as it always does when I hear the Reagan crew talk about their man, is the ultimate underlying message of what they say about him.  Michael Deaver is another one of those staffers who was supposed to be the REAL reason why this C-student and washed up actor from small town Illinois had such amazing success.  Yet here Deaver is, just like Jack Kemp, just like Pat Buchanan, just like so many others that worked in the Reagan White House, expressing total admiration and attributing all their successes to the greatest U.S. President of the 20th Century.	2001-07-18
US	50007423	R29DV12E9M1WXH	0140186832	247841222	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (Twentieth-Century Classics)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Joyce's Mastery of Literature and the English Language	I began this book not knowing much of what to expect from it.  I generally like classic novels, but I also like to have a clearly-framed plot and several well-developed characters.  &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; has none of this, and as that started to become apparent as I read, I was worried that I would not even want to finish the book.  Instead, I finished it in a couple nights, and I now consider it one of the best books I've ever read.  What's most amazing is that the idea to this book is so simple.  It's about a boy (this one, Steven Dedalus, happens to be Irish), growing up and struggling to discover his niche in his surroundings.  A theme so totally simple and done so many times before and since.  <br />But the author is what makes all the difference here.  The eloquence of Joyce's language and his beautiful descriptions are hard to believe came from one mind.  I feel some authors get so caught up in their vocabularies and metaphors that they lose the ability to connect the object of their descriptions to the reader.  This is never a problem with Joyce.  His development of Steven Dedalus, from boy into young adult, progresses perfectly from the start to its inspiring peak at the book's close.  <br />The Modern Library ranked this as their #3 book of the 20th Century (Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; was #1).  While putting a rank to the best books of a 100 year period is somewhat ridiculous to me, I don't know if I could name 2 books that I've read from that time frame that are better.  And that is what surprised me most about this book.	2001-07-11

In 1984, the main character, Winston Smith, struggles to gain personal freedom of mind under the Big Brother government that has taken over London, England and the rest of Europe.  The constant chatter of the &quot;telescreens&quot; (written before the days of TV) and other mediums of propaganda are virtually inescapable in this frightening world.  Orwell's monotone (but vivid) narrative demonstrates his genius because it makes the scene so much scarier, yet all the more realistic to the reader as well.  The novel races up to the climax, before its conclusion with an ending (and final line) that is among the most famous of any from the 20th Century.  If you've never read 1984 and only heard it referenced, you need to read it because you may be surprised to see how similar its terms are to life in the modern, &quot;free&quot; world.  At the same time, you will see why it is ranked among 20th Century classics as well.	2001-07-08

The official Churchill biography by Martin Gilbert was condensed by the author into this one volume, 1000+ page, wonderful book (released in 1991).  Gilbert is direct, never overdramatic and as objective as possible for an official biographer.  Also, this book is very factual and historical.  For anyone looking for witty Churchill quips and anecdotes, I recommend James Humes's, &quot;The Wit and Wisdom of Winston Churchill&quot;, or Stephen Mansfield's, &quot;Never Give In.&quot;  This book is a strictly condensed biography that strays very infrequently into humorous side stories and quotes, of which Churchill obviously had many.  <br />It can be very frustrating to waste time reading an unenjoyable, lengthy book, especially for the busy, nighttime only reader (like myself).  This book is not one of those.  Gilbert does a great job of handling one of the most (I believe &quot;The&quot; most) captivating men of the 20th Century.  At the end of the book, whether one loves Churchill or hates him, any reader will, thanks to the masterful writing of Marting Gilbert, be sad at Churchill's passing and the book's ending.	2001-06-24

In it he covers many areas of modern-day life using a strongly focused Biblically-based perspective. At almost 600 pages, the book is somewhat lengthy, but never boring, and unarguably worth the time.  I loved reading this book from front to back.  Colson uses his experience and wisdom to discuss a wide range of topics like the most recent developments in the evolution debate, post-modernism, Western Culture, and many other aspects of modern-day life.  This is a book that I have recommended to many friends, and I have heard nothing but strongly enthusiastic responses from those who have read it.  This is a book that all believers will love reading and be greatly encouraged yet deeply challenged by.  Chuck Colson is an amazing man and a great writer.  Buy this book even if you don't have time to read it right away because you will read it at some point and truly enjoy the time you spend doing so.	2001-05-30

The book is entertaining at first, as Bowden recounts Pablo Escobar's rise to power, and his subsequent reign of terror as head of the Medellin drug cartel.  But after Escobar &quot;escapes&quot; from the lavish prison he had built for himself, and goes into hiding, Bowden's story falls off.  Ultimately the chase for Escobar settles down into a simple, predictable, manhunt for a highly wanted criminal.  For anyone who is completely unfamiliar with the United States' efforts to fight drug cartels in Colombia, this book will be more captivating.  But for the reader who has some familiarity with the subject this book will be a bit of a letdown.	2001-05-28

The Joads are forced from their family farm due to the Dust Bowl crisis of the 1930s. Once their farm becomes unproductive, it is foreclosed on by the bank and the Joads are left homeless. Steinbeck's classic is a depressingly honest look at the poorest socioeconomic class of the Depression. As the Joads move West to California and then try to assimilate themselves into a land where their kind is unwelcome, Steinbeck often pauses to observe the larger picture of the desperate circumstances of life for the common American of that era. The Grapes of Wrath is a beautifully written novel about an ugly side of life. While it is heart-breakingly sad, readers will appreciate it as a classic because it is so vividly real. I think most will come away from this story with a deep appreciation of where the United States has come from.	2001-05-28

It is the story of the US soldiers killed by ambush on the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, as they were executing a dangerous mission to capture several Somali warlords.  The bravery, courage, and loyalty these soldiers demonstrate in this book in giving their lives up for their fellow soldiers is beyond admirable.  But the best part of the book is how Bowden stretches a story that lasted less than a day into a few hundred pages by recounting the street shootout from several different perspectives, including those of a couple Somalis.  A normal reader will not be able to set this one down until being finished with it, and I believe most fair American citizens will gain a great respect for these US military men who gave their lives fighting to restore peace in a foreign land gone mad.  Mark Bowden was fair in this book not to point fingers, since he was just telling the story, but there are questions that Bill Clinton and Les Aspin (who was forced to resign because of this incident) should have to answer in relation to this massacre that they most likely never will.	2001-05-25

Everest Disaster	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Surprisingly Well-Written Thriller	The story of the tragic Mount Everest expedition that is the subject of this book has been told in many interviews, articles, and TV documentaries.  But Jon Krakauer's account is by far the most captivating. <br />I loved reading this book for a couple main reasons: Krakauer does a wonderful job preparing the setting and introducing the reader to Mount Everest, and then he lets the story take over.  In the first couple hundred pages of Into Thin Air, Krakauer uses the time that the climbers spend slowly hiking the lower parts of the mountain, acclimating themselves to the altitude, to introduce all the players in the disaster that follows.  Then with the final half of the book he tells the story of the fateful ascent to the mountain's summit and the storm that took several lives.  The last hundred or so pages of this book make up the best true life thriller retelling that I have ever read.  Krakauer's writing is perfect in that it makes the story so vivid, but it doesn't get in the way with overdramatization as one could easily do with this unbelievable event.  This is one of those books you will still be up at 4AM reading if you aren't careful.  Definitely worthy of its best-seller status.	2001-05-20

Sproul lays out the history of the debate on free will as it relates to Christian salvation.  This book is very informative, and divided conveniently into chapters devoted individually to each theologian that Mr. Sproul discusses.  Sproul makes very few judgments on the philosophy of each thinker, and he only briefly mentions his personal theology, Calvinism, in the chapter on John Calvin.  For the most part, he lets each subject's words and writings present their beliefs for themselves.  Sproul just follows along to summarize and translate the more esoteric theological topics for the common reader, when necessary.  Willing to Believe is easily read and a solid, quick outline of the history of some brilliant church leaders' thoughts on man's will.	2001-05-18

Liar's Poker is a funny look at life on Wall Street; especially the life of lower-level employees getting their start in the financial world.  Michael Lewis uses the personal experience of his financial career in the Salomon Brothers bond program to tell the larger story of the rise and fall of the entire firm during the 1980s.  Along the way he tells some funny stories and gives the reader an interesting, inside look at the fast-paced life on Wall Street.  But in the end, the book starts to drag and Lewis's cynical view of the securities industry begins to get tiresome.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what a trader's life is like inside a major Wall Street firm.  It is an interesting, initially humorous read that is appropriately not much longer than 200 pages in length.	2001-05-14

Along with Marvin Olasky, Myron Magnet is considered a foundational author of the compassionate conservatism philosophy that President Bush campaigned upon during the 2000 presidential election.  This is Magnet's manifesto for that philosophy.  <br />In this book Mr. Magnet traces the roots of the radical shift that the privileged classes, the &quot;Haves&quot; as he labels them, enacted upon the culture of America and the entire Western world.  He documents how in the middle 1900s these intellectuals, with a worldview based in Marxism and Freudianism, used America's universities and judiciaries to take hold of the system and transmogrify it to fit their causes, many which were originally well-meaning but ultimately, and tragically, misguided.  The results of their success in turning America's previous culture on its head are seen throughout our society, but its effects have been far more pernicious to the impoverished, or, the &quot;Have-nots.&quot;  The change in crime, illiteracy, illegitimacy, income and many other telling rates from the American underclass began almost instantly and are now staggeringly depressing.  Most of us have seen these numbers repeated ad infinitum, but this book will show you how and why these things happened in a way that many other social commentaries will not.  This is a fantastic work that addresses a sad topic with an optimistic tone.  It is one that all Americans should read and explain to their families and children as well.	2001-04-29

It tells the tale of Dante's journey through Purgatory, led by his guide, Virgil.  Having passed through the depths of Hell (the Inferno) in the first volume, Dante and Virgil ascend the mountain of Purgatory, passing its many allegorical characters and observing the penances they must fulfill.  The Divine Comedy is a beautiful, epic poem that takes the reader through a wide emotional spectrum and many vivid, picturesque scenes from Dante's fictional afterlife.<br />This translation was wonderful.  Each of the 33 Cantos (Chapters) is set up in this sequence:  1) a short summation by the translator, 2) the poem, and 3) notes on names, characters, and items referenced by Dante.  The translator, Mark Musa, even explains in his notes when he has a differing interpretation of a word or phrase than other translators' have had.<br />Dante used so many references to Greek mythology and events that were common knowledge to educated people of the 13th-14th Century that this poem, without notes, is entirely esoteric and fully appreciated only by the most erudite modern-day readers.  Mark Musa brings every reader up to par with his thorough, easily-read notes; thereby making this classic poem a very entertaining and profound experience.	2001-04-21

(I've read a few.)  Mr. Musa provides a brief summation at the beginning of each Canto of Dante's Inferno.  He then follows the summation with the actual poem (his translation), and then, after each Canto, he gives in-depth notes on all the references Dante has made -- which may often be obscure to the modern reader.  This version is perfect for high-school and college students as well as the leisure time reader who simply wants to become acquainted with this foundation of Western poetry.<br />The Inferno is the first volume of the Divine Comedy and tells the story of how Dante is taken by the spirit of Virgil through the depths of Hell.  The scenes and characters that they encounter cover many different human emotions; mostly sorrowful ones while Dante and Virgil are in Hell.  This first volume is the most famous of the three, but Mark Musa's translation makes it so quick and entertaining to read, that I think most will find themselves wanting to continue on into the final two volumes, which I would highly recommend in order for one to obtain the entire perspective of this brilliant poem.	2001-04-21

While it is the story of the Pequod's journey around the world in search of Moby Dick, it is also far more than that.  The psychological studies of Captain Ahab and the other boatsmen that Melville has sent along on the voyage are captivating.  At down times in the Pequod's search, Ishmael, the onboard narrator, gives many insights into the mind of the typical early nineteenth century whaler.  He also gives brilliant, colorful analyses of whales and other marine wildlife encountered on their journey.  Some of these chapters may seem tedious at first, but their fundamental nature in relation to the heart of the story and the motivation of its lively characters quickly becomes apparent.  While this book might appear lengthy to the modern American reader, it is definitely worth the time spent in its consumption as it is one of the most beautiful of all American novels.	2001-04-14

In this book, Peter Schweizer not only gives detailed accounts of the behind-the-scenes strategies on how the Reagan Administration finalized the downfall of the Soviet Union, he thouroughly documents his sources.  Schweizer conducted numerous personal interviews with high-ranking officials that worked during the 1980s at the CIA, National Security Administration, and the State Department.  From those he lays out how the Reagan teamers put the Soviet Union in a fatal chokehold through three main areas: 1) bargaining with Saudi Arabia to drive oil prices down, ruining Russia's main source of revenue, 2) covert operations to supply the mujahedin fighters in Afghanistan with the arms to expel Russian forces from their country, and 3) underground support for Solidarity members in Poland.  <br />A student friend of mine was taking a course in which his professor was a former head of counterintelligence at the CIA, so I had my friend ask his professor to verify the legitimacy of Schweizer's book.  My friend reported back that the professor, who says many reports have been almost fictional, said that he HIGHLY recommends this book for the most honest assessment of how Ronald Reagan and his team won the Cold War.	2001-04-07

Most books written by non-writers might tell a good story but not in a dramatic way that a true author otherwise might.  Bugliosi has no problem doing that with his books.<br />I thought I had a pretty good idea of most everything that had happened during this whole ordeal that ended the era of &quot;peace and love,&quot; but I didn't know the half of it.  Bugliosi needs over 700 pages to vividly recount every second of what led up to the Manson murders and every detail of what was done to bring the killers to trial and put them away.  This is without question the fastest and most intense 700 page book I've ever read (and I've read a few), and that can be credited to the sheer madness of this case and the brilliance of the deep-thinking, amazingly-talented prosecutor who closed the case and then wrote this book to tell everything about it.	2001-03-25

This version (Penguin Classics) has a wonderfully informative(81 pages) introduction that will bring anyone not familiar with Edmund Burke or his writings up to par.  <br />Edmund Burke originally wrote what became &quot;Reflections&quot; as a letter in response to a young Parisian man who sought his support.  He later went back to elaborate upon the original letter and wrote this book, knowing then that the book would be read by many more than the simple few that would read the letter.<br />In &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;, Edmund Burke lays down his arguments against several items on which he disagreed with the National Assembly leaders responsible for the French Revolution.  The basis for most of his concerns was that he saw the French to be tossing aside all the prior wisdom and knowledge gained throughout history, simply to erect a radical, new government.  It is amazing in retrospect to see how uncannily Burke predicted the Reign of Terror that would follow shortly.  Thomas Paine, a hero of the US Revolution, who then went to France to aid in their revolt, angrily chastized Burke and this book, in Paine's &quot;The Rights of Man.&quot;  But while Paine gave many valid points in his book (I recommend it and this one for the full spectrum of the debate), he clearly ended up on the wrong side of this argument. <br />Another thing I found so amazing about reading this book was how Burke's warnings to the French are still almost entirely applicable today. One of my favorite passages, Burke writing about the general public, is something I would love to personally deliver to every modern-day political pollster (not to mention Bill Clinton &amp; Co.): &quot;A perfect democracy is therefore the most shameless thing in the world... It is therefore of infinite importance that they (the people) should not be suffered to imagine that their will, any more than that of kings, is the standard of right and wrong.&quot;<br />I recommend this book to anyonewho thinks logically or wants to know why conservatives think the way they do.  Also, if you believe yourself to normally be conservative, but often find yourself pinned or lacking an explanation for why you are against something that the majority, or &quot;trendy&quot; minorities, might support, then this book is where you need to start.	2001-03-24

Dreman does a great job of keeping this book interesting by not only giving examples and stories of market swings, but he also uses psychological studies to explain these seemingly contradictory moves.<br />The book starts to feel repetitive in later parts, but it can be forgiven as extra reinforcement of these facts is necessary to combat the way most people familiar with the stock market have been taught to read market numbers.  I had read another book on contrarian indicators, and while the graphs and numbers it showed were fascinating, it wasn't until reading this book that I was shown WHY those indicators work.  So I recommend anyone not familiar with contrarian market indicators read a book on the basics of them, then read this one for an in-depth showing of why the indicators are successful tools.	2001-02-28

It is the story of a young girl, Scout Finch, growing up in Alabama during the 1930s-40s.  She lives with her brother and father, the often referenced Atticus Finch.  Her father has been appointed to represent a black man being tried for allegedly raping a white woman.  The novel deals with the Finch family's persecution for Atticus's role in doing what he knows to be right, and specifically, how these events affect Scout's view of the world as she grows up.  <br />The picture Harper Lee paints in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is of an honest, noble man and his struggle to raise his children as a single parent in the impoverished Deep South of the early 20th century.  They live in a neighborhood of several eclectic personalities, from the brooding, misunderstood Mrs. Dubose, to the mysterious Radley family.  The Alabama Ms. Lee portrays is a beautiful rural arrangement of small towns and counties, with many wonderful, honest citizens, who are unfortunately overshadowed by the hateful actions of others.  <br />&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is one of the most beautiful stories I've ever read, and it left me occasionally saddened, but ultimately proud of my homeland, the American South.	2001-02-24

Flexner did a good job of highlighting the key parts of Washington's career: his war-time service, and his activities as President.  This book does pass fairly quickly through Washington's childhood and adolescence, which I wished to have learned more about, but it is a 1 volume summation, so that should be expected.  The author was very fair and objective in this book.  While he sees Washington as having been an average, if not below average, soldier, Flexner does show Washington to have excelled in other areas such as leadership and management which became very critical to his success as President.  So for anyone looking for a reasonably quick cover of Washington's public career, with a shorter background of his private life, I definitely recommend this book.	2001-02-19

The opening line of Anna Karenina lays the groundwork for this often depressing, yet ultimately inspiring story: \\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\"<br /><br />Tolstoy's classic that follows tells the tale of several years in the lives of two families who's paths have intertwined.  One family centers around Anna, a self-centered, troubled adulteress, while in contrast to her stands Levin, a strong, inquisitive, honest man who seeks to enrich his familial relations.  The plot meanders up to the climax, but the character development throughout is what makes this novel a classic.  The insight Tolstoy had on human nature almost seems divine, and he used this to produce figures in this novel that the reader will often hate at the same time that he/she will sympathize with them.<br /><br />This book may be dreary for all but the most devoted readers, but those who stick with it will be rewarded in the book's finale.  Levin's spiritual reve!lation at the end of his struggles left me highlighting the many brilliant parts of the final few chapters. This is one of the best books I've ever read. Buy it and enjoy it.	2001-02-11
US	50007423	RDJ2CWO3UK971	0786865792	778104326	The Borderland: A Novel of Texas	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Somewhat disappointing; not a bad book though	This book came highly-recommended by fellow native Texans and I had read the reviews placing it among Texas classics. I think many are searching too hard for the next legendary Western story.<br />Shrake lays out a setting that seems to have great potential for an exciting Texas novel. His descriptions of pre-statehood Texas are beautiful and will have any reader constantly imagining what it must have been like living in Texas when it had few laws and fewer boundaries. But in the end, the book falls short of an epic Texas story as the battle scenes are often short and hardly captivating. If one begins this book by discarding the hype, they will probably come away with a better opinion of it than I had.	2001-01-31

Lee: A Biography	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Very factual, objective biography	This book was a very factual, steadily-flowing, concise 1-volume biography of General Lee's entire life.  I had read reviews here that felt this book did not focus enough on Lee's Civil War battles, but I thought the author (Emory Thomas) focused as much as he could (in a 1-volume biography) on Lee's Civil War conflicts.  Robert E. Lee was an amazing figure, and Thomas does a good job portraying him fairly; neither deifying Lee, nor demonizing him either.	2001-01-24
US	50007423	R3TTNPLJOYZSNQ	0679764410	864803147	American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson	Books	4	23	27	N	N	A very fair and intriguing book	This book was a very fair and fascinating look at a very complex, often paradoxical, yet amazing man.  With the way both conservatives and liberals fight over the true legacy of Thomas Jefferson, it was very refreshing to read a book, by a great writer, that takes a very fair, honest and direct look at Jefferson's good and bad sides.  Any fair reader will come away from this book with a great appreciation of a brilliant man's struggle for what he thought was best for his young country.  Jefferson had many views that many in our modern society quickly dismiss as ridiculous, hypocritical, or racist, but Ellis is very careful to put himself in the place of an observer from that era rather than some politically correct, elitist critic that so many of us are inundated by today.  Yet at the same time Ellis is far from a blindly praising Jefferson disciple.  This is a great biography, that flows quickly, and is very fair and worthy of one of this country's greatest men.	2000-12-31

Luther continually calls Erasmus back to the Word	I believe that anyone who considers themselves a Protestant or is a member of any Protestant church that developed from the Reformation should read this book.  This book is known as &quot;the Reformation Manifesto&quot; because it addresses what Luther considered the main disagreement that people of his belief had with the Catholic Church.  He called the papacy, indulgences, and other issues such as those, mere trifles.  When you read this book, and understand how critical the debate on &quot;free will&quot; vs. total grace is, then you understand why Luther could then say that the other, more dramatic, better-known issues that Reformers took with the Catholic Church were merely &quot;trifles&quot;.  Those disputes simply stem from the difference in belief that true Protestants have with the Catholic Church when it comes to works and salvation.  I only wish our society wasn't so scared to speak as openly and passionately as Luther does here about this issue (and many others) among Christian denominations.  Every Protestant should read this book to know what they are truly protesting.  And obviously I encourage any other believer or non-believer to read it as well.	2000-12-27

I found a lot of interesting facts and information in this book concerning the beginnings of not just  the Presbyterian Church but others such as the Catholic and Anglican  churches.  I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to gain a little  more insight into the history of not just the Presbyterian church but of  Christianity as well.	2000-04-11

I was amazed at how  some of the negative reviews here call Bork's case for censorship  &quot;shocking&quot; and &quot;scary&quot;.  I can't think of a better  example of how people on that side of the argument would rather scream and  scare people away from rational debate.  Bork bends over backwards before  presenting his argument to give his true belief that censorship is a scary  thought but then gives examples of cases where it might be the only  solution to saving our society.  Anyone who would dismiss as  &quot;shocking&quot; or &quot;scary&quot; a call for censorship in the case  of child rape and mutilation has some serious problems.	2000-04-04
