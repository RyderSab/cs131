This was my first Bertie and Jeeves book and I think it's a comic masterpiece.  In Code of the Woosters, the plot spins faster and faster until the immensely satisfying end, where everyone gets what he or she deserves.<br /><br />Wodehouse's comedy has no mean side to it - his writing remains engaging without resorting to the snideness that many humor writers employ.  I still can't figure out how Wodehouse keeps my attention and keeps me laughing when his general theme is the unwavering silliness of the English twit.  I'm heading to the bookstore for more.	2005-03-07

One of the lessons I took from Quartet is that if you don't make the effort to establish or maintain friendships, you're doomed to a sterile, lonely old age. <br /> <br />Thoroughly enjoyed the way Pym slowly exposes the nuances of each character in her usual subtle way:  just a phrase or even a word gives away a lot.  I also loved the little plot twists thrown out just at the end, hinting at the possibility of changes ahead for all.	2005-02-08

Is the praying supposed to assuage one's guilt over what is essentially bullying a small child? <br /> <br />I was also very disturbed by his many allusions to incest and began to find Dobson's obsession with that subject positively creepy.   <br /> <br />Look anywhere else but here for advice if you're a parent.

This book is of the same cloth as Dobson's other child-rearing tomes:  more of the \\"spank and pray\\" school.  Dobson is all about adults imposing their wills on kids in all areas.  He doesn't understand the difference between respect and fear, and that's the main fallacy behind his so-called theories.      Any bully can command fear - it takes some finesse, compassion and hard work to earn respect.	2005-02-03

I push \\"The Death of David Debrizzi\\" on anything with two legs that reads.  Once a year I reread it myself and still howl like a hyena at its biting wit and surprise end.    The book is about a young pianist-turned-teacher and his prodigy student.  Along the way, other musicians join the cast:  an eccentric Russian piano prodigy and a scheming, mediocre conductor.  Professional back-stabbing, career comebacks, and prima donna pianists with hilarious affectations litter the novel.      One of the funniest episodes in the book concerns Debrizzi's recording of a fictional work of music, \\"The Death Spiral,\\" described as \\"beautifully ugly,\\" \\"a putrid musical stew,\\" and . . . impossible to play.    So much drek gets published and promoted to the heavens.   Don't miss this hard-to-find gem.	2004-10-21

This one just took my breath away.  The chases, the shipwreck, the weird Arctic world provided many an interesting night of reading for me as I ate my usual snack of Raisinettes and flipped the pages.   Just superlative writing with a superlative plot.

More exposition of the Aubrey / Maturin characters and not all of it flattering.  <br />O'Brian doesn't shrink from showing warts and all of his main characters and that's what makes these books complex and enduring.  It's hard to predict how Aubrey or Maturin are going to act, because O'Brian feeds you just a teaspoon of information about each at a time.  Just when you think you've got them figured out, O'Brian throws you a curve, and one that's believable, not contrived.<br />These books are some of the best I've ever read.  I howl at the shenanigans of the sailors, get churned up when they're in battle, and shake my head when Jack Aubrey risks his career, chasing the wrong skirt yet again.  <br />And I worry about what the hell I'm going to do when I finish the last novel in the series.	2004-03-13

What happened after the first 20 or so pages?  It started as a well-written little page riffler, promising a good account of the black death, but then descended into mediocre writing.  Maybe the problem is that the characters remained 2-dimensional, never developed more than those you see in a pretty bad movie-of-the-week.<br />I thought the author might compensate for her problem with character development with a ripping narrative of life during plague-time, but that curiosity stayed mostly unsatisfied.  Her inability to step out of a modern frame-of-reference is crippling, and it consigns this book to bodice-ripping romantic fiction.   <br />Immediately after finishing this tripe, I pulled out Barbara Tuchman's excellent history, &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot; and reread chapter 5: &quot;This is the End of the World : The Black Death.&quot;  If you want a well-written account of the plague, Tuchman's is the best out there.<br />The inspiration for Year of Wonders is a gift on a platter to a capable writer.  Geraldine Brooks squanders it in this novel.  Poorly done.	2003-10-02

It gave a lot more details than the show and tried hard not to pass judgement on the individual families.     It was a hoot that the Brooks and the Clunes would not have anything to do with the petty, hyper-competitive Tennessee family after they got to know them. Even at the post-show get-together, they sat apart. The Tennessee wife, in particular, was much more focused on one-upping the other families than simply curious to see if she could cope with 1880's hardships. She was what my grandmother would have called a \\"pill.\\"     One of the family members in the book made an interesting observation: he had hoped to get away from the frenetic busy-ness of modern day living, but instead found himself living just an 1880's version of freneticism, working nonstop.    Finally, the book left me feeling that only one person in each family was actually gung-ho about participating in Frontier House. The rest of the groups went along, but not as enthusiastically.     Personally, one day without diet pop, hormone replacement therapy, and microwave ovens, and I'd be ready to kiss suburbia and strip malls on the lips.	2002-12-22
