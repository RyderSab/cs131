I had not heard of this case, but I do like the books John Glatt writes, so I bought this..... Besides being another husband on family murder a la O.J. and Scott Peterson, this case is not over yet.  He is convicted, it is overturned, he is rearrested, the charges are dropped, he is rearrested yet again.... etc.  It is very interesting..... except that I have been trying to get an update on the case and haven't had much luck.  I wish all authors had email addresses so we readers could reach them with our comments and questions.  In any case, this is another well-written true crime book by Glatt and it is terribly sad in this day of easy divorces that we have so many men resorting to this type of crime.  It is especially appalling when the perp is a former law enforcement officer.  One can only hope he will  a come-uppance of some sort in prison.	2005-10-04

It is about the adoption of a Korean baby by a Minnesota family and that adoption's  consequences.  I liked the juxtaposition of Jane going back and forth, in her mind and heart as well as in reality, between the U.S. and Korea.  I have often wondered about the international adoptions of Asian children, and the practice continues unabated today with Russian children being adopted in America.  I don't think anyone who hasn't been through the experience could possibly relate to the horror of being taken from your mother, and then from your homeland.  How terrible it must be, even for those who appear to have made the adjustment perhaps better than Jane.  It appears that Jane's Minnesota family had no instruction, or even interest, in learning about Jane and her sister's background, either prior to the adoption or in the many years following, and unfortunately I think Jane is correct in her final conclusion that the American mother can't love her beyond a certain point because she just simply is not the child that the American mother wanted.  Very sad.  The book has moments of history and of humor in a book whose structure goes beyond the typical memoir.  I finished the book wishing that I personally knew Jane, because she sounds very human and wise and open-minded and loyal and appears to have all those traits that draw people to her.  I will be interested to learn if she has children of her own......	2005-09-16

Griselda Jackson Ohannessian's memoir about her childhood tells of a time that really WAS the good ole days.  She was lucky to have lived the life she did in the mid-twentieth century in the rural east coast.  She had a loving family with lots of smarts, and as a family one couldn't ask for anything more.  As she tells the stories that they lived, there is almost no hint of the tragedy to come.  I could feel her pain as she described in a very few pages the almost total destruction of the heretofore loving, caring, intelligent adults in her life. The book left me feeling so bad for her, with the feeling that I knew her and her siblings, and I wish I could hug her, even now.  This is the quintessential story of innocent rural life being invaded by so-called sophisticated society, and the resultant damage it did.  I am supposing that Mrs. Ohannessian is a content woman today and has been able to move beyond the damage that was done to her.	2005-09-10

I read it when it first came out, and I remember writing a \\"fan\\" letter to the author when I was only about 2/3 of the way through.  It was that good!  It was such a thorough picture of this family (and hence thousands upon thousands of families) following World War II, through the 50's, the revolutionary 60's and straight through to the 1990s.  The family members are all so different, just as the members of my family are all so different.  The book is brilliantly hilarious and scathingly ridiculous and funny and tragic, all at once.  In short, here is a typical American family of those years; here are the parents who tried so hard and made so many mistakes, and managed to squeeze in a life of their own along the way; and the 4 children who tried so hard but didn't know what they were supposed to be doing -- their parents' way? A new way? A radical way?  What they didn't realize was that they had choices.  They also didn't realize that when they made those choices they were not irrevocable.  I have just read of the death of one of the children and that has spurred me to check out the book here at Amazon.com, and to get my copy down and read it again.  It is history, people.  It is OUR history.  Please read it.  You will see yourself and your friends and neighbors and you will laugh and cry and be happy to have lived such a varied existence.	2005-07-26

I had already read most of the details of the Christian Longo murders in Carlton Smith's book, but it was no problem reading them again because the crimes were so dastardly and this book so well written.  I also was curious about the author's so called crime of inventing parts of a piece he wrote for the New York Times. <br /> <br />So, after reading the author's account of his \\"crime\\" (which alternates in this book with Long's horrific crimes), plus the account of the NY Times and others, I do not see evidence of a crime of any sort.  For all those writers (journalists) who think they are being totally truthful and tell the truth and nothing but the truth, have they forgotten that \\"there is nothing new under the sun\\" (Ecclesiastes 1:19) and that therefore all writing is in some way pilfered from other sources.  For Finkel, who is a fine writer, to have been fired for what he did is as ridiculous as historian Doris Kearns Goodwin's name being smeared in a hateful manner for doing something similar.  How on earth can a story be told, any story, without using something that is not entirely new?  There are only so many ways the scant letters of our alphabet can be arranged. <br /> <br />That being said, this is a very readable book and I wish the best to the author and hope to read more of his works soon.  Hopefully, the shunning of Finkel, Goodwin and others will soon halt in the face of common sense. <br />	2005-07-10

I remember reding about this book when it was first published, but really had no interest in reading about yet another failed marriage.  Too depressing.  But then after reading The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls and learning that this author is her current husband, my interest was piqued.  I LOVED The Glass Castle and was very curious about John Taylor as her husband.  So I bought, and read, this book.<br /><br />I can sort of see why one reviewer here referred to the author as \\"whining\\".... But then don't we all when we go through the harrowing, nauseating experience of divorce?  I did.  And I'm not a whiner.  I thought the author was just being as honest as he could.  The only part I really didn't understand is what actually happened in this marriage to cause it to be so miserable for each of them.  They got married, they did this, they did that, and then he was having an affair since he was so miserable.  About what, exactly?  Maybe his point is that it doesn't have to be anything specific in this day and age of demanding absolute happiness; anything less means d-i-v-o-r-c-e.  Sad.<br /><br />In any case, I enjoyed the book because men usually don't write about this stuff.... and because I can see why he and Jeannette Walls were drawn to each other.  I would have liked to read more about him and Jennette, but maybe that will come in a future book.  I do believe that Jeannette definitely deserves a quiet, reassuring, stable marriage and it would appear that John Taylor can provide that for her.	2005-06-05

I read a lot of true crime and it is amazing how many unreadable books there are out there.  But this one, I thought, was very good, even though I knew the ending before I started it.  I do agree that it was quite padded towards the end, and it is true that the author pats himself on the back many more times than necessary, but hey, if he did indeed contribute to getting this murderer off the streets, that's okay with me.  Maybe he can very heavily edit the last few chapters and add the news that will come from the trial.  If he can do that, then he will have written a very comprehensive book about a creep of a killer.  I am hoping that those new chapters might include more about Rader's families -- both the one he grew up in and his subsequent (and current) family.  That should be interesting reading.  In any case, I think the book was well-written and well researched and these crimes have now been solved.  Let's agree that for a lawyer (ahem!) the book was well written.  If Robert Beattie were a journalist that would be different, because I do not believe journalists should insert themselves into these types of stories.	2005-05-27

The book cover is totally misleading to state it includes the 6th season; it includes SOME of the 6th season, but not all of it. What happened to truth in advertising?  Other than that disappointment, the book is inclusive and colorful and relates some of the more interesting (for lack of a better word)  storylines.

It truly is an American Angela's Ashes, and is also told with humor and without any anger, rancor or self-pity.  The life this woman had as a youngster defies all description.  I have several current photos of the author, Jeannette Walls (from Vanity Fair, Entertainment Weekly and various online articles and interviews), and while I was reading the book I kept looking at the pictures to try to reconcile today's gorgeous tall redhead with the little buck-toothed girl from the hollows of West Viginia where she grew up.  It is an amazing transformation and makes one think that THIS is who she was meant to be all along.  As I was telling my husband about the book, every incident I told him about, horrible though they sounded, was couched with REAL love from her parents, as well as high intelligence and curiosity about the world that nourished Jeannette Walls and her siblings, probably unknowingly, at every turn of their lives.  In some ways, she was very lucky -- and especially because after having endured what she did, she seems to bear no ill-will or woe-is-me attitude.  In fact, I daresay she is grateful for the knowledge gained from having been her mother's and father's daughter.  This book was a delight.  I see where one reviewer here said she read it in one sitting in about 4 hours.  Not me.  I read slowly so I could digest every word, every incident, and I didn't want it to end.  These types of books don't come along very often, even though we are drowning in so-called childhood memoirs.  This one is a delight and an inspiration.	2005-05-21

Looking back on this practice it seems so cruel to both the mother and the child.  I was wondering what becomes of these young pregnant girls today, and it hit me: abortion.  How very sad in a totally different way.  Society has its ways, often brutal when looked at from a distance, even a very short distance.  Both ways of dealing with unexpected/unwanted pregnancies are obviously devastating to the mother, but at least adoption affords an opportunity to become acquainted with the child who was given up.  In this story, the author has a rocky few years as we all do in one way or another, but always has the love of her children, and always has the hope of finding her baby.  When she finally does, it is very exciting to read of the thrill the mother feels and of the slow awareness of the found child, now a grown woman who had never had any plan to seek out her birth mother.  While being excited for Susan, the mother, my heart went out to Joanne whose entire life was instantly changed by this meeting.  She was a married woman with a job, friends, and a loving family.  Now, she was justifiably afraid of this woman entering her life, claiming to be her birth mother, who was pitting her entire happiness on Joanne's returning her love.  Susan never quite goes over the line relative to stalking or smothering or demanding love, but she gets close.  In any case, it is a very satisfying book and it is nice to read about such nice people who can have such a happy conclusion to a heart-breaking (for the mother) beginning.	2005-04-22

I didn't know about this case and the details held my interest throughout.  Mr. Link writes with occasional wit which is a nice change of pace for most true crime sagas.  My only complaint is in the Epilogue where it isn't clear whether or not some of the players are still alive, or are alive but changed so much it is hard to believe they are one and the same person.  In any case, I am glad to have come upon this book and commend Mr. Link for his diligent research into a very intersesting case which pits clergy against modern courts.	2005-04-16

This book does have a lot of new info, starting with the very first page about Peterson's adultery at the beginning of his marriage.  I read this book straight through and actually was surprised at how well it was written and how well it was edited considering it is a so-called quickie book.  There are a few errors, but a very few, and they don't distract at all from the book.

I picked it up not knowing much about chimps, but the thought of raising one along with your own child was an amusing and amazing premise.  The book never fails to be loving, interesting, and educational all at once.  The author loved his little chimp just as he loved his wife and child, and his expressions of love and knowledge about the various animals (mostly chimpanzees) he talks about in this book are lovely.  Man can often be very cruel and foolish and stupid, whereas it seems animals are just themselves.  They can survive in all sorts of man-made zoos and such, with nary a complaint.

For example, was Binjamin tattooed with a number on his arm?  We are told that Varena is not Binjamin/Bruno's wife, but then are never told who she is or what connection she has to him.  Was any DNA evidence ever made public, or is Binjamin/Bruno's true identity an ongoing mystery?  I am reading the article in Granta #66 by Elena Lappin, and in the first few pages have learned that Binjamin/Bruno was married prior to his relationship with Varena and has three children!  What a shocker.  Why was this not mentioned in Eskin's book?  Where are the children now and what do they think about the whole Wilkomirski affair?  In any case, this book is passable as an introduction to the case, but I do agree with another reviewer here who stated that Eskin's personal history, other than being the catalyst to his investigation of the Wilkomirski affair, is really not very interesting (and this from a lover of memoirs and family history).	2004-11-26

When the movie came out and my husband wanted to see it, I decided I wanted to read it first.  I had 24 hours to do it, and it was easy to read in 24 hours.  It is a very fast read and every single word is interesting!  It is amazing to me how much ground is covered in this book and while I was reading it I told my husband \\"There is a lot in this book that won't make it into the movie\\" because it is not politically correct.  It is a scathingly honest look at small-town America including the racial problems they continued to have well into the 80s.  But that's not why I read it.  I also didn't read it because it was a book about football.  I read it because I was told it was a story about individual human beings -- high school kids and their teachers and their parents and the town they live in. And it was fascinating and very true.  I can believe why the author received threats of bodily harm when his publisher proposed a book signing in their town -- I guess no one likes to really, truly see themselves as they really, truly are.  (I probably wouldn't like it, either.)  <br /> <br />The book follows the 1988 football team from Permian High School in Odessa, Texas through their senior year, taking many side trips along the way.  It is a fabulously-written, many-faceted book which was a delight to read.  There were about 5 different points in the book when I put it down and jumped up and said \\"Oh my God!!!\\"  because I couldn't believe what was happening!  Needless to say, some very surprising and shocking things were happening in that small west Texas town, as I guess happens in all American small towns.  I told my husband about some of them as I read them, but had to save a couple because they would obviously be plot-points in the movie and he hates to be told about a movie before seeing it.  I can't wait until we see the movie because then we can discuss it. <br /> <br />Please, do yourself a favor and read this book.  It is a great read and you will learn about yourself and your kids and your neighborhood along the way.  Even a little about football, which, as Americans, I guess we should know a little about.	2004-10-10

This is one of my all-time favorite books, and I can't even remember how a California girl (ahem!) like me came across it.  Oh, probably after I read The Road From Corain, another book about growing up in the Australian bush.  Anyway, I just don't understand why this book isn't in print in the US and why no one has ever heard of it..... It is SUCH a great story (true story) of a girl just growing up in the circumstances she was born to, like all the rest of us.  Only Patsy was born and reared in Australia, in the bush, and therefore it is a childhood quite unlike any of us Americans can even imagine.  How her mother kept her childhood just a childhood so she was not cognizant beyond a little girl's understanding of the difficulties in which they lived is a real testament to the love, strength and courage of mothers everywhere.  Patsy was just a little girl, like the rest of us once were, and made the best of what she had.  This is a terrific book!  It rates up there with any memoir written by an American that I can remember (and I've read loads of them).	2004-08-07

I bought this book after reading a delightful article about the author, Schneidman, in the Los Angeles Times a couple of weeks ago (GREAT article, too, if you can find it!)  The book is thorough, to say the least.  I think probably everything that could be said about Arthur, the man who committed suicide, has been said.  I would like to see a picture of him -- or would I?  Turns out he was very self-centered; in fact, it's hard for me to believe all these people adored him as they seemed to.  I don't mean to pass judgment on the man, but just wanted to let readers know this is an excellent, fascinating primer on suicide, and even of human nature.  It is not too technical, and it is very touching in parts, not to mention educational.  If you have ever known anyone who has committed suicide, or even know of someone (like Sylvia Plath, the poet), this book will hold your interest all the way through.	2004-07-09

It is hard to believe that this is the first book by David Baron, because it is everything a book should be: it begins with the heart of the story (the killing of a young runner, probably by a cougar) and then delves into those subjects we never feel we are interested in or can understand, such as science, the natural history of the Wild West, man's insistence on doing what we want, when we want, and living anyplace we choose, and then tells of heart-pounding stalking and serial killer type behavior. Throughout, Baron gives historical retellings of other encounters with mountain lions. The book wraps up as well as this story can be wrapped up, with lose ends flying in the wind as we search for answers to our desire to move into the territory of wild animals.  Baron spares no one, including the parents of the young man killed or the Division of Wildlife employees, who in my opinion appear to be worthless.<br />To compare this story to the book and movie Jaws is right on. However, we have to remember that this is a story about real people and real events and real animals and should be taken seriously since attacks by wild animals on humans seem to be increasing at a high rate.  It is amazing to me that some people who had their pet dogs carried off by cougars appear to be more upset than some people whose very lives are affected. To read about these people and their silly ideas and patently absurd notions about moving back to nature is eye-opening.  When the west was truly wild, we did not live with these magnificent creatures. We hunted them or stayed out of their way; we did not try to live with them.  And we certainly did not think they were cute, cute enough to take their pictures as they lolly-gagged on our patios where our pets and children play.<br />This book deserves to be a bestseller since it is both a great read and discusses issues of major importance.  I hope the publisher and booksellers give this book the attention it so richly deserves. I also hope that Mr. Baron continues with his writing since he has a unique talent of being able to inform without being preachy and at the same time tell a riveting story. It is one of those books that held my attention throughout and that I read slowly so it would not end so quickly. And the ending is fitting to any book about serial killers and the like, which is to say the ending is truly chilling.	2004-01-30

So far, this is the only book I have been able to find on the Parker-Hulme matricide case.  I normally wouldn't read a book about lesbians, and I thought lesbianism figured very little in the movie, but I didn't find it distracting here in the book, it didn't take away from the facts of the story. There are loads of details here that aren't in the movie, but I agree with others: why hasn't this been written about before, and especially now since Hulme is known to be the mystery writer Anne Perry?  All in all, a very good book, and I read a lot of true crime!	2004-01-20

I read a lot of true crime books, and this is one of the very few that went right in the trash when I finished it.  This book is supposedly written by a journalist, but Birkbeck is more of an opinionated boor, in my opinion.  His continual comments upon the character of everyone associated with this unsolved case is more than annoying, it is cloying and leads me to believe he must have a stake in this case in some sick way.  Is he obsessed with or in love with the detective (Becerra, or whatever his name is -- I don't have the book in front of me; it's in the trash)?  This is an unsolved case.  Many law enforcement people have worked many long hard hours on the case, but in the author's opinion there is only one of them who &quot;really cares&quot; .... Give me a break!  No wonder Birkbeck writes for People magazine rather than one of the more respected magazines available today.  Disgusting!  Boring book!  Breaks no new ground.  Ick	2003-11-05

I stayed up late several nights to read it, because I wanted to read every single word.  Sandra Leigh's story is sad but true and replayed, unfortunately, over and over again in this day and age.  I don't know how she managed to tell such a detailed story in the present tense, but she did and it is wonderful, giving the reader a feeling of being there.  I kept looking at the photo on the cover, and hoping that it is a real photo of her and her siblings, because that is exactly the way I pictured them.  The story ends at the beginning of the rest of her life, literally, and it BEGS for a sequel!  I am hoping there will be one, and will visit her site until it is available!  Her family is wonderful -- beautiful and loving mother, siblings that she loves deeply, even the dogs come to life here.  Thank you for such a wonderful book.  Hopefully, the writing of this book managed to serve as a kind of catharsis to Sandra for all of the sadness of her youth.	2003-08-22

The couple who adopted her were fabulous parents.  They were good to her beyond all measure and loved her unconditionally.  Unfortunately, Sarah has never been able to accept that love, let alone return any of it.  The story she tells, however, of the search for her birth parents becomes more and more fascinating as the pages turn..... It is quite a story, and by the end of the book I felt that she had come to terms with who these people were and are, but the adoptive parents are still out there someplace, wondering what happened to the little girl they adopted and loved.  Sad story.	2003-05-20

And now that I've finished it, I consider those nights wasted.  Who cares about any of these characters?  They are the epitome of spoiled college kids who spend most of their time drinking and using drugs and the rest of their time thinking how intelligent they are.  The main character hates his parents, hates his hometown, hates everything about his life until he gets to college and then he finds a group of people he can spar with intellectually.  In the end they are all insane or dead and Richard lives on, still hating everything.  The references to classical lit were great, if a little too, too.....	2003-05-20

This book could have been so much better.....It is a fascinating story of psychiatry/psychology/psychoanalysis in the middle 1900s, but this book involves one person, and one person only: the author, Stephen Eliot.  Why is there nothing about his family members?  One photo is characterized as being a picture of his late brother....What?  How did he die?  Was it integral to the story?  It is as though Eliot existed (exists?) in a vacuum, and things just happened to him for no particular reason.  Why was he sent to the School in the first place?  Why?  What did he do, or what happened to him to cause his parents to spend so much money and send their son off to strangers to raise him?  It is an interesting tale of Bruno Bettelheim and his practices, but he is a shadow figure in this book.  I hope another student, or teacher, from the School writes a book someday that will include more than just one simple focus.  Yes, I know this is an autobiography, but the author's self-centerdness, world-revolves-around-me-only got old after the first couple of hundred pages.	2003-05-09

I have had the book for some time and just never read it.... But when I finally did pick it up I didn't put it down (except to eat and sleep) until I finished it.  It is very reminiscent of Frank Abagnale's memoir Catch Me If You Can in that both writers were devastated by fathers they both loathed and loved and as a result turned, themselves, to lives of crime.  Psychologically, it is very interesting, although it does not pretend in any way to be an analysis of the writer's actions or thinking or even feeling.  This book has been described as humorous, but I didn't find it funny at all.  It is painfully sad and excruciatingly honest and describes various situations the author got himself into, but funny they are not.  In fact, after many of the crimes and weird situations with people he knew, he burst into tears, not being able to explain why.  It's something we can all feel without having to know.  I love to find such honest books.  It was a delight to read and now I will move on to Rayner's other books.	2002-12-21

To think that the Catholic church is so callous is heart-breaking, but we have read enough of these types of stories recently to know that it is true.  The hierarchy within the church are not only callous but are self-righteous and even hateful, in my view.  This family suffered so terribly and unnecessarily, each and every one from the parents down to the 9 children and beyond, that it is a heartache.<BR>  This book is so well researched and written, it certainly deserves a higher priority in the bookstores!  I just happened to come across it on a table of &quot;new books&quot; in my local bookstore; I am saddened that it won't be widely read, because it needs to be.  We cannot continue to blindly trust huge establishments, such as the Catholic (or any) Church; and we must fight injustice all the way, as this family did.  Unfortunately, outdated laws are preventing the remaining family members from any sort of justice, let alone compensation, but maybe laws will be changed down the line and these people will find the courage and strength (not to mention money and time) to continue their battle.  I am ashamed of the Church.  I have come to despise it.  Please read this book and see what they have done to our children and to it's members who have taken a wrong step when they were minors......	2002-12-01

I have enjoyed Wambaugh's other true crime books, and watched for this one to go on the Best Seller lists.  When it didn't, I decided to buy it anyway.....And I wish I hadn't.  Wambaugh obviously despises the man he refers to as &quot;the fire lover&quot;.  He holds him in such contempt that this is in no way an unbiased account, but on the contrary it is a diatribe against this man.  Admittedly, the &quot;fire lover&quot; has done some despicible things, but, please, let the reader come to that conclusion. Why write 338 pages about a man you hate?  Spare me......I'll read a more objective account of this in the newspapers.	2002-12-01

It is very illuminating as to the reasons Hanssen is the way he is--for the most part an inept jerk, though scholarly intelligent.  I will read another of book on Hanssen, because there is probably much more than is reported here.  Though I found the alternating chapters about Freeh interesting, I felt they were fillers and really had no place in this book.  Still, the book held my attention all the way through, and so I will give it 5 stars even though it left me wanting more.	2002-11-10

Don't be afraid to read it because you think it might be too sad...... Of course it's sad, but there is lots of detail here we haven't read before, and the author is almost reverent at times when writing about the people on Flight 93.  He is tender throughout, and respectful.  It is a story for the ages, one that probably won't be repeated in terms of heroism for a very long time.  As the author states, this was not a group of everyday, ordinary people thrown together to deal with catastrophe, but rather these people were extraordinary, as well-qualified as anyone could hope to be to deal with a situation such as the terrible hijacking and ultimate destruction of Flight 93.  They were all leaders who knew how to work as a team.  They were all brave.  They were all strong in spirit as well as physically.  Bless them all for what they did and for what they have taught all of us!<br />There are so many books being written about September 11, probably all of them well-intentioned.  This one is going to prove to be the most personal, I believe, as it is based on recorded phone messages, recorded messages from the cockpit, and interviews with the families of the victims.  Included are several pages about the hijackers and their backgrounds and the stories of the people on the ground in Pennsylvania and how they experienced and dealt with what they saw.<br />Kudos to the author.  This is journalism at its best, with a heart!  Please read the book.	2002-09-22

It was recently rehashed on PBS' Frontline, and low and behold! there are more questions now than ever before!<br />I read this book in the early 1990s and was mesmerized by all the accounts of so-called sexual abuse of children in day care centers.  But guess what, since that time, there have been virtually no incidents of such a thing!  I live near Los Angeles, and I watched with great interest the McMartin PreSchool case around the same time wherein all the defendents were eventually acquitted of hundreds of counts of child sexual abuse.<br />The theory used to be \\"Why would a child lie?  You can trust what a child says.  Where else would a child hear these (crude) sexual terms and know about sexual acts?\\"   But times have changed........And interview techniques for children have come under scrutiny and have been left lacking, to say the least.<br />Why were there so many of these cases ten years ago, and none now? Is the media just not reporting it?  Is it not happening anymore?  Did it ever happen?<br />This was truly a mesmerizing book and I remember thinking it was a journalistic reportage and therefore unbiased, but now I'm not so sure.  Illeana was eventually deported after serving some time in prison, but because she testified against her husband, Frank is still in prison, serving a 165 year term.  Has justice been done in this case?<br />If you can find a copy of this huge book, read it with an unbiased eye, and remember, while you are reading it, that it was, or may have been, written during one of the USAs many \\"witch hunts\\".  (Why do we still have them?) This is a very readable and shocking book.  Too bad it isn't still in print because it is a very important book, as well.	2002-04-26

Jeremy was good-looking and charasmatic and very arrogant.  He wanted money for his high life-style of traveling, light drug use, dressing well, lots of girlfriends, etc. and apparently didn't want to wait for his parents (adoptive parents, at that) to die, or to share any inheritance with his sister (who was also adopted).  I don't want to give away anymore of the story, but even knowing these details going in, it is so well written and there are so many interesting characters, I read this book quickly and hated to see it end.  The biological parentage of Jeremy will surprise eveyone not familiar with this tale of horror in Britian.  I am hoping the author has written more books of this sort, because she was very thorough and unbiased.  If you like true crime, this one is a keeper!	2002-04-23

It is shocking that more people don't know about this book and more shocking still that the Catholic church has never even laid a placque or mentioned this catasgrophe from the pulpit at OLA!

I am a little older than the author and grew up in a small town in California; (coincidentally, I was also in the first graduating class of our new high school, and we were also dubbed the \\"Knights\\").  Other than having those things in common, I have never been to Lake Havasau--and, from the photos provided, can't even picture where the London Bridge might be.  But the author's humor and delightful memories made this an enjoyable book!  I guess because of the \\"therapeutic\\" times we live in, most memoirs involve abuse and anger and other negative issues. But this author focuses mainly on the fun part of growing up, which is the way I remember my teen years.  Teen angst, sure, but fun.  If this book were edited for it's many grammatical errors (which is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars, rather than 5), I would hope to find it on a bookshelf anywhere in the western United States.

The book is heart-breaking and wrenching, but I couldn't put it down because it is written with such honesty that I felt a friend was talking to me.  The mystery of the murder is inconsequential, but has to be known before the author can know herself, so the book is part true crime and part gut-wrenching honesty.  The book reminds me of Change Me Into Zeus' Daughter by Barbara Robinette Moss.  I believe Moss is, like this author, a writing professor, and this is why these books can tell of such harrowing experiences in such a beautiful way.  Thanks to the author for this book.

Each one is more spectacular than the last!  Here is the Golden Gate in fog, at sunrise, at sunset, at high noon, and every time of day and night (some are time-exposures) and in every weather condition possible.  I grew up in the SF area and have always loved the bridge, etc, but here it is shown in ways you would NEVER see (unless you sat on Mr. Misrach's front porch for maybe 3 years....)

In this book--Anonymity--Anne's siter Susan tells a tragic story of a gay man who was ashamed of being gay and a wife who is the epitome of denial. Everyone in the family suffers (read about the son!) in their own way. The only one who seemed to escape it at all was Anne, the pretty, blond sister who had gone to New York to become an actress. Yet today Anne &quot;recollects&quot; horror stories about her family which do not jive at all with this honest, poetic book by Susan.

It is similar to The Adversary in that both men killed their families &quot;out of the blue&quot;, but this book is much more of a journalistic study and asks real questions, all revolving around the single word &quot;Why?&quot;<br />The author Julie Salamon is a journalist of the highest order.  She tells a shocking story in a straight-forward manner which makes it seem even more shocking.  This is about a lawyer, a family man who was loved and respected, raising three young children, one of them severely handicapped.  He came unstrung one day and killed all the kids and his wife.  He served 2 years, then was released and tried to get his law license back, married and had another child.  It is chilling.  There are many people involved in this story, not the least of which are a group of mothers brought together by their children's handicaps.<br />The book reads like the best of mysteries, the best of medical/psychological journals, the best of true crime, the best of those shocking articles we read in our newspapers about &quot;ordinary&quot; people . . . I wish there were photos in the book.  I am sure all involved looked like &quot;regular people&quot;. <br />This story is presented in so many layers, that when I finished the book I felt like plunging ahead in research, hoping against reason to find some answers.  The book is a page-turner to say the least!  It is a great book.  It deserves a larger audience.  I read it in two nights because I couldn't put it down.  Now, I feel I have nothing to do, nothing to read that will compare with the emotions I felt while reading this book.	2001-06-28

Why not here??  I would love to meet Jerri Nielsen, but NOT her children!...)<br />That said, I know it is none of my business, but I just can't say enough about this woman or about this book!  It truly deserves all the media attention it is getting and I wish Jerri Nielsen the best in every way!  Thanks for sharing your remarkable story with us!!	2001-02-24

A man in France....well educated...respected....a good son....a good husband....a good, loving father....wealthy....lots of friends.......and his entire persona a lie.  We all know what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to decieve, but this is beyond the pale.  When he THINKS he is going to be found out, he kills his ENTIRE family so that they won't be hurt by the truth!  Talk about egocentricity, hubris, narcissism!  This is a wonderfully researched and written book by an author with intense curiosity and lots of heart.  He tells a most chilling story in a very readable way without all the gory details but with enough of them for the most avid true crime reader.  Please read this book, translated from the French.  It is magnificent!	2001-01-25

THIS is what the childhoods were really like for most of us who grew up in the 40s and 50s.  I grew up in suburban California but I still identified with the author in almost every emotion, every situation she describes, even though I had always thought those poor kids who grew up in the high rise apartments in New York were really missing out.  Not true!  I read a lot of memoirs, and I have to say I am so tired of DYSfunctional parents, DYSfunctional situations, etc. This book is like a breath of fresh air.  I don't mean to imply that all was peachy keen, but the upsetting situations the author faced were not built into huge life happenings that she was going to take a lifetime to deal with.  She had a good childhood.  She made a good childhood for herself.  She should be very proud of this book and I hope it gets more publicity so it won't be lost in the deluge of memoirs.	2000-10-22
US	51151875	R2HH6LV3XAXV9S	037540175X	632903056	Eleanor's Rebellion: A Mother, Her Son, and Her Secret	Books	4	3	4	N	Y	WELL WRITTEN, SELF-CENTERED ODYSSEY	This book was exceedingly well-written and seemed very honest, true to the time periods in which the story took place, had some humor and light-heartedness, all the while telling the poignant story of the author's mother, Eleanor, who bore him illegitimately but refused to give him up as the times and her family situation dictated, and so she consented to marry a man who loved her enough to keep her secret and together they &quot;adopted&quot; him and began a rather conventional life.  The author was a somewhat difficult child (aren't we all?), raised in a somewhat dysfunctional family (aren't they all?), but the love and devotion were always freely given and freely taken. The story told here is absorbing and is told in an elegant fashion, but then the tone changed so drastically during the last 70 or so pages that I ended up finishing the book with a bad taste in my mouth.  Turns out the boy--now a 40 year old man with a family of his own-- finds out about his birth and can't handle the fact that his mother was not truthful with him about who his real father was (or is that sperm-donor?) . . . So he does what most self-absorbed people do in one way or another, only he does it in spades.  He drinks, shop-lifts, quits his profession, plays around on his wife, fathers an illegitimate child of his own (with whom he never has any contact), finally leaves his wife and children, and above all, is downright mean to his mother, the woman who basically gave up her future in order to keep this child.  He is mean to her for the rest of her life and I find this so profoundly sad that I guess I am having trouble focusing on the book/story as an item to be reviewed, rather than an issue to be dealt with.  My lingering question is: how could a woman (the Eleanor of the title), a daughter of immigrant parents, be so selfless and at the same time raise a boy/man who feels his perceptions/feelings/right to know/ supercede anyone else's feelings/right to privacy/right to live their own life?  And what makes him think that the world revolves around him and his so-called problems rather than, say, the possible problems of the child he refused to acknowledge?  Where did this profound selfishness come from?  That said, I guess a book review should not take issue with the subject or tone of a book, and so I will say that in my opinion the book was well written, easy to read, but again proves that the secret adoptions of the early part of the 20th century did virtually no one any good.  So sad.	2000-10-17

It was obviously a very painful life that Elizabeth Kim endured until most recently, but it was also very painful for me to read this book; so painful that I had to skim most of it because it was so unrelenting.  I, too, found that not ONE fact was given: what state she lived in, what newspapers she wrote (writes?) for; and on and on. I am wondering if her imagination has gotten the best of her?  It wouldn't be surprising, given the awful things she had to endure after her mother was killed.  But I can't pass judgment on her, and I certainly do not mean to belittle any pain she has suffered.  However, I did just read... CHANGE ME INTO ZEUS'S DAUGHTER, and what a different experience that was!  As with ANGELA'S ASHES, CHANGE ME . . . was filled with humor and loving moments within horrible childhoods.  Was there NEVER any laughter in Elizabeth's life?  Was NO ONE ever kind to her who she may want to credit with broadening her life and her views?  I hope the book was therapeutically helpful for her, and I also hope we will get a journalist to interview her and ask some of these questions . . . . Good journalism, after all, includes &quot;who, what, when, where, and why&quot;.  As a journalist herself, Ms. Kim knows this.	2000-10-01

This is such a wonderful book -- which may seem an odd way to describe a book with such waste and tragedy and sadness.  However, Barbara Robinette Moss shares these stories of her youth with us so poetically and without a trace of bitterness that it becomes more than just a poor, sad childhood.  The book is very similar to the recent ECOLOGY AND A CRACKER CHILDHOOD, which I also enjoyed, but was disappointed in because of the abrupt ending.  This book brings us pretty much up-to-date, and I understand the author is writing a sequel which I am really looking forward to!  I wish this book had pictures and that it told who was who in the cover picture.  Other than that, it was a very satisfying book, full of both tears and laughter, and ending with much optimism.  A wonderful book which I hope will sell well and not be lost in the mish-mash of current memoirs.	2000-09-27

Enough about his alcoholism and how he hurt everyone and how he is so happy with his current wife . . . That is another book, Mr. Black/Armstrong.  The story of your EX-wife and the baby she gave up for adoption is so dramatic and so sweet and so sad that it deserves a book of its own without your self-centered reminiscing.  Eileen was such a good woman and mother that what she endured in her short life is heartbreaking.  But her story deserves to be told as a reminder that the &quot;secret&quot; adoptions of the past served NO ONE and thank goodness laws have changed.  I cried many times in this book, which I supposed is a compliment to the author, but where was the editor to keep this book on track?	2000-09-23

I bought this book over a year ago and recently, when I saw it in  paperback at my local store, I decided it was time I read it!  I don't know  why I demurred, because I found this book to be delightful!  It is a slight  volume that contains more information and humanity than you would think  could be printed in these sparse pages.  By that I mean we get a memoir  spanning the author's family's lives (as well as her own) along with  humanizing stories of her global pen pals, including updates.  I thought it  was quite interesting as a &quot;prologue&quot; to histories of the Middle  East and Europe as well as the United States and Down Under.  Geraldine  Brooks is a good writer who says in a few words what many writers have  written chapters about.  For instance, &quot;Scientists have discovered  that all human beings have a &quot;happiness set point&quot; . . . Thus,  the mood-altering effects of winning a Pulitzer or losing a spouse will  rarely endure.  Within a year, most people are again either the happy or  morose persons they always were.&quot;  And, &quot;I wondered aloud whether  our generation really did mark the end of the era when people thought they  had to go away to prove themselves.&quot;  Not to mention a complete  description of the anorexia nervosa suffered by one of her pen pals, before  anorexia was understood in any way by professionals or lay persons.  Highly  recommended to all who love an honest and thought-provoking memoir.	2000-07-07

I especially was looking forward to such a compelling story being told by one of our great contemporary authors.  Having said that, I was truly disappointed as  I plodded through this account of one of the more devastating human  disasters of this century!  Maybe it was just me, but it seemed that every  chapter was like the &quot;begats&quot; the bible, meaning this book was  &quot; . . . and then this happened . . . and then this . . . and then this  . . . and then&quot;  (you get the picture).  It just seemed very  pedestrian to me.  I wonder if I am the only one who feels this way?<br />      That said, it IS a truly remarkable story and it is surprising that it  hasn't been written before.  Right now, I am looking forward to reading  &quot;A Matter of Degree&quot; by Massey and Davey to be published soon,  which is also an account of the Hartford circus fire.  In addition, I enjoy  the links Amazon provides, and after reading about &quot;The Winecoff  Fire&quot; and &quot;The Texas City Disaster, 1947&quot; as noted above, I  have ordered and received them and will let you know how I liked them.<br />       This book, &quot;The Circus Fire&quot;, does provide all the facts and  many, many great photos, but I just wish the story was told in a more  interesting/readable fashion.	2000-06-30

I bought it in a small bookshop a few years ago, and it has haunted me ever since.  It is about the Chinese in California's Central Valley who developed and lived in  their own town: Locke.  As the work subsided and the next generation grew  up, they moved away one by one, until by now it is almost a ghost town.  A  few of the original Chinese founders remain, however, and the author has  interviewed them as well as others he has tracked down.  So, the book is a  compilation of autobiographical sketches by the day laborers who were, if  nothing else, most certainly over-worked and under-paid.  As an oral  history, it is unsurpassed in honor, honesty and sweat of the brow.  Each  interview is accompanied by photos; some are &quot;then and now&quot;, and  are most interesting!  I hope this returns to print soon so we can all know  the hard work and injustices that so many of our minorities lived with.	2000-06-27

(The book &quot;Saving Graces&quot; is totally cemetery (female) statuary, but almost all from European cemeteries.) This is a new interest for me and is quite beautiful and interesting! Not at all morbid.  One interesting note: all photos taken in the cemeteries photographed for this book have NO living people in them. I wonder how the photographer managed that?

Author Blue interrogates (no other word) her mother about the reasons she stayed in an  abusive marriage until the father (not the mother) decided enough was  enough.  The answers aren't obvious, but they are there--in the culture of  the 40s and 50s, pre-feminism.  I am sure there were many such  dysfunctional families at that time, but who knew?  Dirty laundry was not  aired in public, let alone written about (that is, until Mommie Dearest  smacked us in the face; maybe that book was more than merely sensational,  after all).  This book is painfully honest.  The photos (most taken by the  father, some by the author) give truth to the tale.  Her whole life, the  mother could barely manage a smile.  One can only hope she is happy at  last.  (I found book because of the fabulous &quot;links&quot; and reader  reviews on Amazon.  I know now I will never run out of &quot;good  books&quot;, as I used to fear when roaming the isles of my local, small  bookstore.  Amazon is the greatest!)	2000-06-18

It takes you right into the lives of the people and gives you  a perspective never before thought of.

It is so vivid . . . the people, the places, the events.  I am only about half-way through it, and I just wanted the author and other potential readers to know how much I am enjoying this  book.  I am an avid true crime reader and have been so disappointed in the  &quot;quickie&quot; books recently, the poor writing, uninteresting cases,  etc.  It is such a pleasure to find this book!  I wish it had wider  availability, a bigger publisher to market it.  Anyway, I have to get back  to the book . . . (Thank goodness for Amazon.com which makes it possible to  find books like this!)	1999-09-17

Swango is truly a menace and should be the medical community's worst nightmare.  However, I have  personally seen doctors cover up for one another (one, a drunk; another, so  blind his wife came in on the weekends with him to sign his charts; both  still in practice) and therefore am skeptical that any changes will come  about because of this book.  But they should!!  Great book!	1999-09-13

I am from the bay area--as is this family--so much of the geography was familiar, but even if it hadn't been it is still an honest look at an American family.  Highly recommended as a study mainly of the homefront  during WW II.	1999-09-08

It is a heart-wrenching, but heart-warming story, told mainly in his letters to her, as she was too depressed or too ill to write much of the time.  All Americans should know  the full details of this shameful time in our history.  This book shows how  a man can love his wife under any circumstance.  Highly recommended!	1999-08-19

I bought this book when I was in Canada a couple of years ago, and I am so glad I happened to see it and buy it!  It is the true story of an adopted man who searches for--and finds--his biological family.  These types of books are not usually written by men, so I didn't know what to expect.   Well!  The author is as emotional and caught up in his biological story as  any woman.  (Imagine that!  A man with feelings!)  A lovely man, a great  writer, a heart-pounding story.	1999-07-13

It read like a mystery story--a woman who had been adopted as an infant searching for her birthparents.  What a process she had to go through to get ANY information at all about  her biological family!  There are several other great books by adoptees  searching for their biological parents, and all are very heartfelt,  engrossing reading.	1999-07-13

This is one of the most EXCITING books I have ever read, and I read A LOT!  I am a female and rarely read any kind of military history book.  I picked this one up because of the story of the Sullivan brothers, and because I  vaguely remember hearing about this ship sinking and the subsequent shark  attacks on the survivors.  As I read this I was reminded again that TRUTH  IS STRANGER THAN FICTION, not to mention more thrilling!  What a writer!   What a story!  What a book!  I can't wait to read Kurzman's Fatal Voyage:  the Sinking of the USS Indianapolis, written before this one. (P.S. The  movie of LEFT TO DIE was an abomination!  The movie covers about five  minutes of the book, and not even the exciting stuff.  Oh Hollywood, shape  up!)	1999-07-07

What a delightful book this is, and what a delightful man Mr. Hickham must be to have written it.  Here is a man who grew up poor, with an overbearing father and an older brother-from-hell, yet there is not one ounce of  self-pity or sentimentality in this book.  It is a delicious retelling of  the 1950s.  I was so sad that the movie came out (renamed OCTOBER SKY from  the original ROCKET BOYS for some reason) before the book had a chance to  find its audience, and am equally sad that the movie industry chose not to  publicize the movie.  Not enough blood and guts, I guess. . . In a  nutshell, this is what's wrong with the world today; the good is hidden and  ignored by the powers that be, the rest is set up as the only thing there  is.  What a shame.	1999-07-07

Not to be missed for the true crime buff.  The boys who killed were children and the story is basically unbelieveable, but it DID happen and will probably  happen again given the same circumstances of the parents lifestyles and  &quot;two of a kind&quot; together at the right (wrong) time and the right  (wrong) place.	1999-07-03

Before reading this book I knew nothing about mountain climbing, was not interested in mountain climbing, and knew no one who climbs mountains (I still don't), but I kept reading good things  about the book and bought it in paperback.  Half-way through I went and  bought the illustrated edition, which was more than worth it!  What a book!   I never would have said I liked &quot;adventure&quot; stories before this  book, but now I am hooked.  Right after reading this I bought THE ENDURANCE  and then INTO THE WILD, both of them good books, but THE ENDURANCE perhaps  one of the best books I have ever read (and I read a lot!)  This book was  excellent, but I still cannot fathom why anyone would want to climb a  mountain!!	1999-07-01

Woodward is a good writer and he tells the truth, but when you have heard it all before, it's not interesting.  Really, for those of us who followed the Lewinsky/Clinton fiasco, there is nothing new in this book.  Woodward's  treatment of the other presidents here is more interesting.	1999-06-26

Because the new film of the book came out last year I bought and read it, and the result is that I believe it is the best American novel ever  written, albiet it was written by a Russian expatriot--and English was his  second language!   This book is almost poetic.       It is very funny.      It is a love story.     It is a detective story.     It is a psychological  study.     It is a travelogue of the U.S. backroads in<br />     the '50s.      It is a criminal's confession.     It is a legal defense.     It is the  story of a pedophile.     It is all of the above, and still is very sad.    I loved it, and almost re-read it as soon as I finished the last page.   Instead, I bought Nabakov's bio and read ABOUT it and about him.  Then, of  course, I had to read his other books. . . He was truly a genuis, and quite  an entertainer.	1999-06-25

He graduated from Stanford, got a Ph.D. from Harvard, became a professor at Stanford.  He and his wife and son &quot;relocated&quot; to Santa Anita and then Tule Lake and then  Granada (Amache) during WWII.  He became embittered and an elitist during  the war years, which is told in a very dramatic albiet exhaustive fashion  in the book via his letters.  Following relocation he and his wife returned  to a very different Stanford University and environs, which he found very  difficult to cope with.  Very enjoyable book, personal as well as  historical.	1999-06-25
