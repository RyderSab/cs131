A job offer that will make Mitch exactly what he has always wanted to be; rich/upperclass along with the mystery of these men bugging everything in  sight....leads to suspense and sinks those hooks directly in. By the middle  of this one, I found myself still very interested, but at the same time, I  could feel that things were changing in the style in which Grisham wrote.  By the ending, I was (almost:) completely uninterested, but I kept reading  because someone had told me that the movie ended so much  differently...Honestly, that is the only reason (well, that and the fact  that my husband offered to read it aloud to me while I cooked dinner  &gt;&gt;wink&lt;&lt;) Midway thru this one however, I did go out and get  myself a copy of A Time to Kill and will read that one. Hopefully, it will  carry through ::smile	1998-11-26
