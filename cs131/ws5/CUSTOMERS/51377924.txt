Volume 2 of this inspirational trilogy was published in January 2004 and it's equally dynamic.

Given Sally Mavor's fame as a 3-D storyboard artist, this one is a disappointment. There's nothing in it on making the type of wood and fabric storyboards seen in books she illustrates. Just endless tiny fairies which, basically, all look alike. Cute, but without the lush outdoor backgrounds against which they were photographed, they're uninspiring.	2004-01-17

Skillful study of a British pseudo-aristocrat and fundamentalist Christian eccentric, Bronwen Viscountess Astor. It includes excellent descriptions of &quot;modern&quot; living in one of England's last stately homes (Cliveden), which is now a super-luxury hotel. <br />However, the author's sympathy toward this unstable liberal elite, unseated by the notorious Profumo scandal, is totally misplaced. The 1960's Paris supermodel, obscenely wealthy widow and psychotherapist of questionable repute remains a poster-girl for what destroyed Great Britain: Its shallow, egocentric and vicious upper class.	2003-06-10

This one graphically encapsulates the horror of abject poverty in Victorian Britain and gives it voice through the mouths of its brittle, degenerate victims. Multi-level plot, loaded with shocking intrigue. Skillfully written in a taut, acidic style. No florid text, syrupy romance or latter-day Dickens here. Great dust jacket graphics as well.  <br />Author Sheri Holman is a force to be reckoned with. She ranks with the best of them.	2003-06-10

Hewitt spends half of the boring book glorifying his Gulf War escapades and lamenting the loss of his military career out of admitted stupidity. Yet again, Diana was shown to be a scheming egomaniac with the morals of an alley cat. She should be left to rest in peace. Enough of the mindless adulation.	2001-04-19

Well written account of Diana's tragic life, without being maudlin or fawning. Transcripts of audiotapes made by Diana specifically for this book give depth to the biography. Excellent color photographs, many from personal albums belonging to her brother, the present Earl Spencer. Not a one-sided narrative, as the pro-Diana author doesn't attempt to camouflage his subject's faults and failings. He presents a balanced analysis of a deeply troubled young woman whose agonizing ten-year battle with Bulimia Nervosa was triggered by one of many cruel remarks made by Charles. Although scathing, his commentaries on the British royal family's brutal treatment of Diana are unemotional and thoroughly documented. The anachronistic royals are indeed a shockingly inhumane bunch.	2000-11-05

Over 300 rambling pages of dementia and pathological squalor, both attributed to &quot;faith&quot;. The main characters, three rotting nuns and a treacherous priest, are total degenerates. Excluding the sheep illustrated on its dust jacket, this book has no redeeming features.	2000-10-08

Written by a Jesuit priest-psychologist  who's also a Theology professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los  Angeles, California. <br />At long last, a Catholic scholar who integrates  purely human needs with traditional Church teaching and makes complete  sense. No dissident theology or new age mumbo-jumbo in this very  challenging and thoroughly modern book.	2000-09-15

The book's clear instructions and color photographs are excellent. However, procedures used are extremely time-consuming and require a lot of hands-on work. Basically, they're industrial techniques adapted for home  use. Entirely different from making cold process bar soaps. Even for  experienced hot process soap makers, at least 3-4 hours are needed to  complete the initial phase. In liquid soap making, you have to be  comfortable with using solvents and thickeners. Neutralizing and  sequestering agents too. pH control and preservatives can be significant  issues as well. Aside from that, you won't find a better consumer-level  book on this interesting subject.	2000-05-14

As usual, Patricia King offers brilliant alternatives to buyingexpensive, British imports. Her stoves and fireplaces, made from foundobjects and very cheap supplies, are masterpieces. This highly creative book is beautifully photographed and a worthy addition to three others written by Ms. King: 1) 'Making Dolls' House Furniture', 2) 'Making Victorian Dolls' House Furniture' and 3) 'Dolls' House Bathrooms-Lots of Little Loos'. She also made a do-it-yourself video, but I haven't seen it yet. <br />Another great book of this type is 'Making Period Dolls' House Accessories' by Andrea Barham. Her beautiful lighting fixtures can be wired for small-scale illumination. Many of the pieces shown are perfect complements to Patricia King's Victorian and Art Nouveau designs. None of the handmade collector items in these books are toys and all are too delicate for children to play with.	2000-03-23

Better glycerin Melt &amp; Pour soap recipes can be found for free on the Internet. As usual, this somewhat spacey author ignores known hazards of certain essential oils and recommends unqualified use of them. 'Baby's  Bottom Repair Soap' made with chemical-based Melt &amp; Pour glycerin and  Balsam of Peru is a recipe for disaster. 'Balsam of Peru &amp; Benzoin  Anti-Itch Soap' is even worse. Think at least twice twice before making her  'Pine Tar Soap and Shampoo Bar'. All of the essential oils mentioned can be  extreme sensitizers. Her New Age drivel on Sunshine, Moonbeam and Lightning  Water products are totally over the edge. Basically, this book is for  people who enjoy talking to plants.	2000-03-17

However, accuracy is frequently sacrificed for the sake of literary license. 'Geisha', a documentary by Liza Dalby, is a much better book and should be read before 'Memoirs'. <br />After reading both books, I find the geisha subculture totally  demeaning.

This autobiography is devoid of the nonsense usually associated with Fr. Greeley. It presents his academic prowess and lively Irish intellect in their natural perspective. I'm at odds with some  of his liberal theology, but have to say that he's a very honest man who  obviously loves his priestly vocation. More power to him in his hazardous  fight against pedophile priests and religious and the hierarchy that  conceals them. Fr. Greeley's courageous efforts to eradicate these vile  predators are what turned diocesan authorities and the institutional Church  against him.	2000-02-08

I didn't  want the captivating story to end, despite sadness felt about the demise of  a gentler, more civilized era.	1999-12-24
