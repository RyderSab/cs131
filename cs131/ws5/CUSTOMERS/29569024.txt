I've looked at other bike repair manuals -shiny & glossy and vastly overpriced- and all things considered, Todd Downs $14.00, 378 pg repair advice gets the job done.

I saw myself and my life reflected in so many of the pgs I had to keep reminding myself that I didn't write it.  On the slightly negative side, while the book was a highly enjoying and amusing read, I did think the Americanized version of the story done in Cusack's movie by the same name was much funnier.  Jack Black's performance made the Barry character that much more memorable as did the guy who played Dick.  Not enough stars for this book but 5 is a really good start.	2005-03-26

Altered Carbon grabbed me by the throat almost from the opening line while Broken just sort of held my attention and only because I like the Kovacs sometimes sardonic, ultimately haunted character.<br /><br />The fascination with stack transferrence is still there which has always been a selling point for me as is the tendency to make everything ultraviolent (enhances the story line IMO) but the characters are utterly forgettable. Hand, the corporate shill is mildly amusing but very stereotypical.  He has no depth whatsoever.  Jan Schneider is the the ultimate disposable sidekick while Tanya Wardaning is a high tech whore who throws herself at Kovacs for sex so that he can \\"fix\\" her.  Personally, I found her pickup line amusing however none of these characters -including the rejuvenated broken angels purchased at the soul market- will probably never see life on the pgs of any other book Mr Morgan writes except Angels.<br /><br />Mr. Morgan is capable of bringing so much more to sci fi gumshoe noir table as evidenced in AC so I dunno what happened this time.  Come on, man, get with the program.  I just started liking your stuff and now you go and write this crummy novel and completely shatter my hopes for a real sci fi gumshoe.  Kovacs better be kicking some major @ss in the next book!	2005-03-26

In Ch 4 she gets a little on the didactic side where she attempts to debunk the various stereotypes and cliched mindsets associated with the hacking community but she falls far short of any real insight.<br /><br />Don't bother reading this book if you have even a modicum of tech savvy - the writer won't be telling you anything that you don't already know or figured out for yourself hands on.

You can easily pick up this book and begin reading without having ever read *any* of the Dune books at all.  At a basic minimum, you should have at least read Frank Herbert's Dune book that started it all.<br /><br />I'm about half way through this title at the moment and I'm finding that a lot of the material feels like deja vu.  I haven't read either of the prequels but I have read the first Dune novel and Corrino is eerily remniscent of those storylines.<br /><br />All in all I like Corrino bc I'm a Dune fan and fully intend on reading Atreides & Harkonnen but the intricate storylines and creativity that made Frank Herbert a legend are qualities that are strangely missing in son Brian.  I suppose that's what happens when you try to improve on someone else's literary masterpiece.  Hey Brian, how about developing your *own* universe instead of borrowing from your father's.	2005-02-06

But 2/3rds through the story it fell flat on God's frozen smiling face. The story of disgraced Valpariso capt Anthony Van Horne began earnestly enough -angst is always partial to strong protagonists and Morrow's ability to paint the portrait of his lead character shone through brilliantly right up to when he became sexually involved with Cassie Fowler.  Truthfully the story was compelling to me only because it pioneered new material in the sci fi/fantasy genre -no one has ever written a book based on the death of God before- but that's where the innovation ends.  Morrow started out with an intriguing premise and turned it into a Harlequin romance set amidst a surreal, quasi-religious fantasy novel.  Given the white picket fence with little Montessori-schooled Stevie, complete with a talking macaw ending, Towing Jehovah does not inspire me to read the sequels it has since spawned and that is a shame b/c I had such high hopes for this series.	2005-01-10

Some people object to titles like this one because they naively and mistakenly believe it helps the bad guys.  But in reality, without knowing black hat techniques there is no possible way that you can secure your network. Period.

Most reviewers of this title say that it was \\"mind altering,\\" and, having won the Big 3 of the genre -Hugo, Nebula & PKD- you would think it was the best of the best except I don't feel that way.  I think that Gibson's later work -Count Zero, etc.- was much much better. While Gibson's was the first science fiction book to coin \\"firsts\\" such as the words \\"cyberspace\\" and \\"jacking\\" into the Net, consider that at the time it was originally published -1984- the entire genre of science fiction during that timeframe SUCKED.  While I'll agree that Gibson singlehandedly took the genre off life support, Neuromancer left me largely unimpressed.  It borrowed heavily from a title published in 1974 entitled Dhalgren.  And had more people taken notice of this book, then I doubt Neuromancer would have won the accolades that it did.  Read Delany's Dhalgren and you'll see exactly what I mean.	2004-08-15

While Dante is a suspenseful read, it does not quite measure up to Da Vinci.  Both authors took a fairly fascinating subject and weaved credible fictions but Dante left me wanting more.

I particularly enjoyed reading about Hollywood/L.A. circa 1947-1957.  Hodel's description of the city and the people made me wish I was there, but then again, I have an affinity for gumshoe noir.  The writer certainly did his homework - The case is approximately 56 yrs old and counting so Hodel's detective work was nothing short of Sissyphean.<br />Above all, I found this book to be an enjoyable read simply for the history of the golden days when the city of L.A. was still a nice place to live and for the process of piecing together  and making a case. As to the writer's conclusion, well, the jury is still out on that verdict and probably always will be however with the evidence presented, personally I would have convicted the suspect.	2004-05-04

CISSP material is on the dry side so the book breaks the monotony by interspersing the content with amusing anecdotes.  Note:  If you are one of those people who just cannot accept that a technical book can be anything other than *dry* &amp; boring, then go buy Krutz &amp; Vines CISSP Prep Guide.  While I found that title informative it was *extremely* challenging to stay awake to read it.<br />In all matters of practicality, reading both Harris' &amp; Krutz &amp; Vine's CISSP books were largely informative exercises for me because I don't plan on dropping the $400 bucks to take the exam.  The economy simply doesn't warrant the expense.  There *are* no jobs in security because all the good paying highly skilled positions are being outsourced &amp; offshored to 3rd world scab nations at the fastest rate Congre$$ enables them to be.<br />Furthermore, what's the point of putting your all into studying and securing professional certifications if the best you can do is flipping burgers at $6.00/hr.  Don't kid yourself - that's what the United States is depreciating to.

Suffice to say ended up with the latter, which BTW, is also outstanding.<br />Although I can read pretty much anything Eco writes, Foucault is even better than TNoTR, IMO.  Without giving anything away, all I can say about this book is *don't* read it if you don't meet the following criteria, otherwise you're going to visit a public forum like this one and complain how boring it was and that you had to use a dictionary.<br />In order to enjoy Eco and/or Foucault's Pendulum you must:<br />1.  Possess an advanced vocabulary/intellect that rises above a 6th grade comprehension level<br />2.  Possess an undying thirst for knowledge leaning particularly in the direction of the esoteric such as the Knights Templar, alchemy, the medieval and other assorted liberal arts/classical literature/historical pursuits.<br />In short, if you feel the need to read everything on Oprah's book list and/or read every Grisham you can get your hands on, then chances are, Eco is just *not* for you.	2004-01-24

Some other reviewers here have expressed that the novel is a knock off of better known works - while that may be partially true, it is more accurate to cite that sooner or later *all* cyberpunk tales diverge.  For example, Gibson is held up as the original but the reality is that his 1984 claim to famer 'Neuromancer' was nothing but a turbo-boosted knockoff of Sam Delany's 'Dhalgren,' however, I digress.	2003-11-03
