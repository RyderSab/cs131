Robert Casey is a journalist's journalist, perhaps the best writer of any who covered WWII.  He frequented both European and Pacific battlefields to report the human face of what he saw. In this book, he records events and experiences from the European theater from early in the American entry into the war to the expulsion of the last German armies from France. Covering Atlantic convoys, motor torpoedo boats in the Channel, the D-Day invasion, the breakout from the Hedgerows, the liberation of Paris, he writes with both intense human involvement and the reporter's eye for detail. He was there, and he makes you feel that you are there.  There's nothing like him nowadays; our loss.	2005-10-04

The format of this book, oral histories in the first person, so personalizes suffering and cruelty that I had to interrupt reading many times in order to go on. There is so much pain here that I soon understood why many Japanese refuse to revisit such memories, even after sixty  years.  The book is a record of what happens when those in command plug their eyes, minds and hearts with mud.  As such, it reminds us that we should not be silent about what happened, if we truly wish that it might never happen again.	2005-10-03

Mason, a professional writer, writes from the point-of-view of his youthful self.  His writing is organized, logical and unforgiving toward those he feels let him down as a sailor or as a man. One of the best first-person accounts of life in the old Navy, where form was more important than function.	2005-09-28
US	52750892	R1OK7CE5QS6HC3	B0007F0VCU	101259420	Zoomies, subs, and zeros,	Books	2	4	5	N	N	Incomplete	In this book, Admiral Lockwood reports on the role of fleet submarines in air rescue operations in the Pacific during WWII.  Unfortunately, he glorifies the best & glosses over the worst. He writes, \\"The defects in our Mark XIV torpeoes were serious, but they were corrected in a few months and in a manner that reflected great credit upon the clever, determined youngsters who sweated out the answers.\\" (P. 7).  The defects weren't corrected in a few months, and the youngsters seeking answers were sweating because they were operating at the edge of their orders.  Although he was actively trying to clear up the torpoedo problems, Lockwood doesn't report what he knew or did or who was standing in his way.  Nor does he place responsibility where he thinks it belongs.  He is too busy \\"reflecting great credit\\" to evaluate critically.  For example, in discussing co-operation with bomber command, he writes, \\"I experienced only two cases wherein hard-boiled Air Generals were lukewarm and refused to co-operate.  Their names are of no importance now.\\" (P. 201) Their names ARE of importance now, and Lockwood doesn't mention them.  Then there are games the book plays, such as declining to report the periscope depth of a fleet submarine, for security reasons, while reporting that the sub can't dive inside the ten fathom line.  Do the math.  Then there's the problem of co-authorship. Someone tried to be colorful; I doubt it was the Admiral.  The result is that the Admiral's personality doesn't come through, except in the last chapter, perhaps.  What we have here is a compendium of rescues, culled from combat reports, by an Admiral committed to cultivating his own professional reputation by not offending anybody.  In short, a good summary of deeds by brave men, including the rescue of George Bush, Sr., but with little entertainment or historical value, except for the lesson that one does not become an Admiral by offending peers.	2005-09-26

Interesting for what it says & how it says it. Written almost entirely in dialogue, as if it were a transcription, which it is not.  Like Casey's \\"Torpedo Junction,\\" attempts to tell the truth about how the war was going, despite wartime censorship. An easy read, with large type in the 1942 edition.

US	52750892	RO8GKQNC5DXN6	0060125381	379668619	The Way We Were	Books	4	7	10	N	N	An interesting book	for the reader because of what it's about: (1) A woman who loves a man & changes herself because of her love for him, only to find that he can't change despite his love for her; (2) set in Hollywood before & after HUAC & the blacklists.  It's interesting for a writer or scholar, too, because it shows how a master playwright & screenwriter adapts to the novel.  But Laurents DOESN'T adapt to the form, and I think I know why. He depends on others (actors, directors) to make his plays & screenplays engaging & entertaining; but in a novel, he has to do these himself.  He hints that he can't when he mentions rewrites of his chief character's second novel, and the defects he finds in it are those of the book he's writing!  Also, Laurents's customary method for constructing plot--mixing & matching from a menu--works well for plays & movies where the writer is the maker of plots, but not in the novel, where manners are more important than actions & motives are more important than manners.  Laurents writes a novel like a screenplay, episode by episode, a technique that works for F. Scott Fitzgerald & Terry Southern, because they confine themselves to the superficial & don't seek to explain manners or motives.  Laurents tries to explain, and the result is clinical.  What we have here is Scott & Zelda transported to the Forties through Sixties, with Laurents fleshing out characters with people he has known or heard about.  The result is interesting, not engaging.  Still, a good read on a summer's day, if you can get Barbra Streisand out of your ear.	2005-06-25

Pistone	Books	4	3	4	N	N	More about true police work than True Crime	this book documents the ordeal of the first FBI agent to go deep undercover to penetrate the Mafia, often at immediate risk of his life.  He's a brave man doing brave things at the cost of family life, but not identity, as he always remained who he really was--demonstrating, incidently, that there are many more versions of ourselves in each of us than we may realize.  Like any autobiography, Pistone's own character stands at the center of the narrative, and it's an interesting study: calculating, like a chess player; concerned for his dignity only within the parameters of the role he was playing; committed to his objective totally; able to make close moral distinctions; committed to family, but unwilling to compromise his assignment.  Pistone isn't a Boy Scout, but he doesn't cross the line & become the monster that he's fighting.  His work broke up several major crime families and, more importantly, broke the code of omerta forever, by forcing bad guys to break silence to save themselves. A textbook account of the risks, methods and rewards of undercoverwork, and the most direct account of how bad guys operate that we have. Like many agents of the law, he points out that most bad guys worked harder and made less than if they had gone straight.  Well worth reading on a quiet day, if only because one realizes how much some have sacrificed so that we can have a quiet day.	2005-06-23

This book chronicles her first year of teaching, when she made $90 and spent $100. It describes her duties, where she lived, how she rode to school on a horse, what children did in a one-room school, and who tried to seduce her. It's also interesting for its idiom, Dutchified English, the language of Northwest Iowa. An interesting book for anyone wondering about rural education in the early Twentieth Century or what a one-room school was like for students and teachers.	2005-06-14

Both use proverbs extant in each other's time.  Manipulating point-of-view & time is fun; but it's a fine line between proverb & cliche, and both narrators cross it.  Their anachronisms are confusing, impertinent & self-gratifying, making the book about twenty per cent longer than need be.  Cliches pose as proverbs, stories repeat, and David never understands that he's projecting guilt onto God to avoid blaming himself.  Still, the book is ABOUT something--Jewishness--just as \\"Catch-22\\" is about war, \\"Something Happened\\" is about democracy becoming Corporatism, and \\"Good as Gold\\" is about Corporatism becoming Fascism.  Heller's nihilism is less manic than in his earlier novels, but dominates, as usual.  And as usual, the text is carefully written and edited.  But it's not style or method that makes this a great novel; it's Heller looping around his own core, making connections as he disgorges everything he knows about his subject.  So what if the book indulges the author, pays no attention to the reader, and parodies Zionism while exploring its roots?  It's funny, pertinent, masterful & dark--a unique historical novel. There's nothing like it, except Ken Keysey's \\"The Last Roundup,\\" maybe.	2005-06-10

Ugaki's is replete with what he calls \\"Navy fighting spirit.\\"  He's sentimental, about family, lost friends and Nature.  He's positive, in the worst circumstances. He's the quintissential naval officer; but, like Halsey, his strengths are also weaknesses.  He understands his enemy, but underestimates him. He attacks when he should consolidate or retreat. He divides forces in the face of an enemy of unknown strength.  He always \\"takes the bait.\\"  He never questions the logic of serving a government that has no more steering than a barge.  Because his book reveals what he knew and when he knew it, it corrects misappreciations on both sides. It also exculpates Truman for dropping the Bomb, as it describes Japan's reserves hoarded against invasion and records fanatical desire to use them to the last man.  Why did Ugaki commit suicide?--to take responsibility, obliged to atone for failing. He says his death will help keep alive naval spirit until Japan can rise again. Like other fascists, he blames men, not their ideology, for defeat, while looking forward to the next war. Despite his penchant for poetry, Ugaki is not a complicated man. He deserves the respect due to all those who live by a code not of their own making. His book is a study of one such man.  I found it difficult to read, because of the form imposed on it as a diary and the ubiquitous feeling that Ugaki is writing for History.  Read this book after you've read others about the Pacific War; it pulls missing pieces together--for example, that the Japanese were reading Allied codes, too.  For a first-hand look at the consequences of decisions Ugaki made in abstraction, read Tamaichi Hara's \\"Japanese Destroyer Captain.\\"	2005-05-29

Like many who entered the service, he did so to get away from grinding poverty and to support his family.  Don't blame him for getting into scrapes, fights and disastrous liberty ashore.  He was a kid, at war.  Don't blame him for stiffness in prose; all he knows about writing is what he learned in high school, and, besides, he's entitled to his own style.  Don't blame him for writing still another first-person account of the life of an enlisted man in the U. S. Navy during WWII; each such book adds something new.  He witnessed the cliff-jumper suicides at Okinawa, for example, and he reveals that even enlisted men knew, at the time of Yamamoto's death, the Japanese Naval Code had been broken.  Don't blame the man; blame the book.  It's written from memory rather than contemporaneous diary, so anecdotes lack breadth and detail like James J. Fahey's \\"Pacific War Diary\\" or insights like Shelly Robinson's \\"10,000 Miles Aboard the Destroyer Cotten.\\"  Also, it amplifies memory with research, but lists no bibliography.  Its motivation, I guess, is to write things down so memories wouldn't be lost; to honor friends; and to amuse the author--good enough reasons to spend time with a sailor who served in a death trap of an action station, sixty years later.	2005-05-04

Crosby says about himself that he had no skill at acting or dancing and that his singing was more gimmick than talent, a strategy learned in vaudeville.  If he hadn't been in town at the same time as Paul Whiteman, his life would have taken a different turn, and that would have been okay with him.  As it was, he blew around in a wind that carried him to fame, fortune, race tracks, golf courses and professional friends. Otherwise, he made no contribution, he says, except for two recordings, and he isn't kidding.  What we have here is a modest little man with a great deal to be modest about. Vain, conceited, self-centered, pretentious, affable--what media turns into icon.  The book itself is a series of anecdotes distilled from conversations with a ghostwriter, interrupted when Bing swaps a highbrow word for a lowbrow one, reaching for distinction.  He had an ache for attention, evidently, but his book never deals with the hungers of his personality.  So he's not as interesting as the people he mentions, sometimes indiscretely, despite his own penchant for privacy.  It was a wonderful ride.  I'm glad he enjoyed it.  But yesteryear's wisecrack is this year's yawn.  For a show biz autobiography that sizzles with self-knowledge, read Oscar Levant's or Lennie Bruce's.	2005-04-20

Perelman is one of America's great Twentieth Century prose stylists--the quintessential New Yorker columnist when that magazine set literary style.  The texture of his writing is obviously unique--clang association abetted by immense vocabulary and an eye that never forgot anything it noticed. But there's more going on.  What we have here is a mind in the act of making the mind, a lively intellect using everything as fodder for the imagination, even imagination itself.  Sure, there's a heap of artist performing FOR himself, with reader as voyeur, but it's a first-rate artist transforming reality into something more satisfying than fact.  His writing parodies the magazine \\"short story\\" form.  And it's convoluted, to the point of menace. But these willful distortions make the essence of his experience incarnate by taking its transactions to the level of the truly bizarre, like Jonathan Winters or Hunter Thompson.  This isn't easy reading, but its method--stimulus for its own sake--is intense beyond belief.  And there's value in it as history, given that his circumnavigation happened in 1947, two years after WWII.  The world wasn't the same, and he noticed.  More importantly, if he had it to do again, he wouldn't.  His writing is caviar: a little is a treat, a plateful sickens.	2005-01-04

This has the usual intricate plot & the usual suspects, though Kay is dumber and Fredo is gay & in the closet.  But Winegardner doesn't know the people he's writing about, just how they behaved.  Mario's eye is missing, as are his observations & dialogue.  He'd have laughed at having a ghostwriter exploit him as a corporate brand.  A well made novel & entertaining.  Okay for those who want more of the saga and don't care where they get it, but not the real thing, \\"of course\\"--a phrase Winegardner should banish from his vocabulary.	2004-12-30

It isn't a novel; it's a docudrama, because many stories are drawn from headlines.  Some have appeared on TV, in various cop shows.  Characters are cops the author has known, but, as usual, Waumbaugh is incapable of portraying women, except as tramps or whores, so females are cardboard cutouts.  Waumbaugh writes adventure stories for boys, like Hemmingway & Joseph Conrad, but a good adventure can be a good read; this one is.  Interesting for its lore, Waumbaugh's confessional references to the Classics, and the experience of watching him learn his craft.  And there's a moral: The true danger of police work is that \\"those who fight monsters must take care not to become monsters.\\"	2004-11-03

It contributes major understanding about that era.  Inevitably, it asks whether the risks and expense were worth it; but it offers no answer.  Here's one: Spying provided incontrovertable information to each side about the other's intentions, thus reducing threat of nuclear war.  The effort was worth it, not for what it achieved,but for what it prevented.  Everyone involved in these operations (even traitorous spies) helped prevent nuclear war.  To those who did so from courage, their nation owes gratitude as surely as to those faced the perils of a shooting war.	2004-10-18

But these reminiscences add little to Churchill's legend, beyond shared moments when events in the background carried her along.  She needed heros like Winston & her father (also a prime minister).  She seems not to have noticed that, when Winston was most down, she wasn't there for him.  The book IS \\"an intimate portrait,\\" and it illuminates political and social life for British aristocrats in the early Twentieth Century; but I learned more from Lord Moran's biography and Churchill's own writings.	2004-10-10

This is a collection of first-person reports of dogfights against Axis fighter planes by American fighter aces, with strategy for each theater of operations and biographical material thrown in. Episodes are as repetitive and numbing as the dogfights they describe. Either the flyer got up behind the foe, fired, and watched the enemy go down, or the enemy got behind the American, who nevertheless escaped (since these aces survived to tell their story).  The most interesting tale, and the longest, deals with a downed pilot escaping through enemy lines into Normandy after D-Day. Also interesting is the service records of aces after WWII.  The structure and style of this book, keyed to reporting action only, make it seem heavy.	2004-10-03

Friel gives us strategy and tactics he used, including interview techniques and psychological gambits.  He admits that his method would have failed if trust hadn't broken down in the mob because of actions by a godfather who was thought irrational and vicious by his mobsters.  Friel shows how bureaucratic methods are couterproductive--everything from time wasted in report writing to conviction of the innocent.  His suggestions for change are consistent with management theory about large-scale organizations.  As an investigator, he's thorough and competent; but these very qualities sometimes make it difficult to read this book, as it suffers from heavy prose.  There's an irony or two, but never a laugh.  Investigating organized crime is serious stuff.  \\"Breaking the Mob\\" is more penetrating than other first person books about true crime, but less penetrable.  Worth reading, as a legacy of how the good guys got the bad guys & what it took to bring them down.	2004-10-01

There's the usual Wambaugh mix of booze, women, blurs between right & law.  As usual, there's no insight or development for female characters, who are cardboard cutouts.  But this time, instead of playing with character & language, as in other books, he projects his insights into those he depicts, without modifying their character.  It's docudrama, despite its gunslinger theme, like Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood,\\" a form Wambaugh is good at, maybe because it relieves him of tense necessity of creating a plot.  Oddly, this book isn't cynical, even when describing disappointed moral objectives; but it does prove what Aristotle said, \\"We become what we do repeatingly.\\"  A police department that sends men to work in Hell shouldn't be surprised if they turn into devils.	2004-09-26

More about their lives in Providence & Boston.  Frank must have been sincere to have given up a construction business that employed 10,000 people in order to do something for those trapped by industry. Book makes Taylor seem a Social Darwinist and one of the first academic careerists to make consulting his business.

As he said himself, he was a &quot;daredevil&quot; and a &quot;drunk.&quot; But he lived long enough to realize it & suffered greatly in the process. He doesn't hit the brutality he encountered too hard. He didn't hate the Japanese, despite the POW camps he was in; he hated careerists and martinets more, and says so. Discipline wasn't his forte, but he knew the difference between wartime and peacetime leadership, when many didn't. He valued friendship above all and found friends everywhere. He manged to alienate those he worked for and earn the admiration of those who worked for him. He was the man Hemingway wanted to be--hard-drinking, two fisted, a fighter, a man's man. But his values changed as he left youth behind. His introspection about the growth of spirit is limited, but he's clear about balance being the only road to happiness, and he sets out on that road with the determination he exhibited in his flying career. He says he was never brave and that the line between being brave and being a bum is a fine one. It was in his case, as he admits. This is a man who did what he had to when he had to and had no illusions about the patriotic gore he heard or read. He reveals his humanity by what he notices and reports, sometimes grudgingly. But the effect is one of a confessional by the unrepentant, as if some of the twelve steps in his cure were still missing. Overall, an unpretentious book by an Ace pilot who lived through the worst and lived to tell about it. Worth reading, and more humane and unpretentious than most books by WWII pilots.	2004-08-01

He alienated President Kennedy so much that J. Edgar Hoover was unleashed to pressure local police to bird dog Bruce's nightclub act. The cops would lurk in the back, wait till Bruce said something vulgar, then bust him for obscenity. In court, the fuzz would do Bruce's act so badly that Bruce was convicted for their lack. He beat the rap, at the U. S. Supreme Court, but it took a lot out of his native optimism. He shot up on heroin till he overdosed--assuming it WAS suicide. Remember Marilyn Monroe? What's easier than knocking off a junkie with an overdose? With Oscar Levant and Alexander King, Bruce is one of the three great wits of America at mid-century. Worth your time, because he repays you with insight wrapped in laughter.	2004-07-27

It was written in 1943, heavily censored by the Navy, and not published until 1945. As it was authorized by submarine brass to provide public recognition for the Silent Service, it contains what that the Navy wanted the public to know about its undersea heroes and submarines, mostly S-boats, during the earliest days of the war. So the material here, the earliest made available to the public, is often unique. There's some deliberate disinformation by the Navy--the crush depth of fleet submarines, the speed & range of torpedos, names of American ships sunk by the enemy. Pictures of submarines in the book aren't identified, for example. The torpedo problem isn't analyzed, and there's no hint that Japanese naval codes had been broken. Casey avoids how subs were vectored to intercept, mentioning only wireless between subs; but he wasn't numbed by the demands of wartime security. He puts down what he learned--that men in the boats were more impressive than the boats themselves & that the captain was the most impressive man aboard. After many requests, he was authorized by the Navy to be the first journalist to bring the Silent Service's story to the public. His travels impress--Mare Island, New Haven, Bath, Pearl Harbor. He's also done homework on the development of the submarine. His views on the style and teamwork of crews are insightful. There's a picture of him in the book; he looks like an Irish priest. He's an interesting man, author of multiple books of romance, biography, mystery, travel, satire, war (he wrote &quot;Torpedo Junction&quot;) and even a technical book on radio interference. He writes in high &quot;New Yorker&quot; style--introspective, elegant, insightful, strong--a journalist who knows how to tell a story, a writer who cares about language, a scholar who tracks down his sources, a moralist who tells more truth than the censor can bear. Here he shows what brave men did to slow down Japan until the U.S. could get back into the war. He may be right that submarines in the Asiatic Fleet prevented collapse of Australia. He includes stories that he verifies and those that are legends, both of which became standard fare for Hollywood movies about submarines; and perhaps this book was the source for several Hollywood scenarios. The true stories are so familiar that they seem like cliches--sinking cruisers & carriers, surgery on the wardroom table, the wounded captain who orders his boat to dive while unable to leave the deck. But some are unique--like chiefs risking their lives to save their emblem of office, their hats, while abandoning ship. And this is the first time that any were written down in one place. All in all, interesting source material & a good read on a rainy night by an interesting man who knew how to get other people to talk.d to slow down Japan until the U.S. could get back into the war.

These aren't short stories--more like scenarios, or poems in the form of scenarios.  Jonathan Winters impersonates children, a baby robin, a migrating duck, a tiger, a lunatic from an asylum on a picnic, a bear cub that becomes a teddy bear, a child going to an asylum, the President of the United States hosting a boring reception, a man attacked by a bear, soldiers, an alcoholic Navaho artist looking to his Medicine Man for a cure, a test pilot, orphans, Santa Claus &amp; a turkey, among others.  He has it in for Admiral Byrd--maybe the name, because birds appear often.  Each &quot;take&quot; has a twist at the end, more for surprise than irony.  His tone is more screwball than bizarre, as if he were trying to bean the reader with a wild pitch.  His method is to strew stimulation everywhere, but he also deals with serious subjects--love, war, loss.  His mood is plaintive rather than deep, like a kitten crying.  He searches for value &amp; finds none except laughter, as if he were Kafka scripting an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot;  If the book gets thin in places, it's because the written word is less effective for a performing artist than the spoken word.

And a mystery to be solved, from the thinnest of clues, with a bent ending & no resolution.  And all wrapped in stories cops tell each other--with great dialogue, well developed male characters, and one-dimensional females.  Ah, the job, the job!  Starting each of the early chapters off with point-of-view that shifts with each character was irksome to me, but, otherwise, a good read, overlong for its novella content.  Here's its irony:  Wambaugh is trapped in the world that his characters are trying to escape, even as he writes about it.  Experience makes cynics of us all, and cops get cynical fast, including those who write about what they learned.	2004-06-09

There's a heap of synthesis here, from oral and written histories, old photographs, interviews, newspaper articles and conversations.  Kesey connects them and supplies imaginary material to create a farce with a gonzo tilt, as if he were on acid and explaining to Hunter Thompson.  Kesey uses local color well and has an ear for period phrases,  even when slapping them on with a palate knife, but that's the fun of it--watching Kesey stretch his brain around facts.  The book is really about the author and how he chooses to indulge himself, not about what happened in Pendleton or what the reader should think about what went on there.  In fact, the way Kesey jumps from one time frame to another shows how little he's concerned with keeping things straight for the reader.  This book is bent.  You can enjoy its distortions or look away, but you can't deny the brilliance or uniqueness of its colors.  One burr under my saddle is that his cowboys aren't as &quot;strong, silent and truthful&quot; as I'd expect.  Pendleton must have been far more polite and stuffy than Kesey lets on.  But bizarre distortion reflects his intention of zonking out on history until it assumes a form more pleasing to him.  In taking this trail, he proves that the humblest writer scribblng a dime novel from dubious fact is more of an author than all the librarians at the Library of Congress.  The point, after all, is the mind in the act of making the mind.  If connections seem bizarre, well, that's just Kesey taking on reality, whether the time is now or a century ago.	2004-06-08

Unlike his other books, Breslin uses little dialogue and leans heavily on narrative, as if trying to put down everything he knows. He knows a great deal, about New York, about the Irish in New York, about why New York is New York. He doesn't much like what New York has become. The best of his book is how he makes a woman's struggle to control her destiny seem real. Maybe it was necessary for him to put this into historical context, but his story might have had more impact if he had omitted some of the history of one Irish family. Maybe he needed to warm up, He spent a long time on the book--&quot;ten years to write,&quot; says the dust jacket. What we have here is a writer trying to straighten himself out as he learns his art. Worth reading as another illustratation of Oscar Wilde's saw, &quot;The Irish are wonderful, except, of course, to each other.&quot; The whole history of Ireland lurks in that epithet & in everything Breslin writes.	2004-06-05

Superficial in its treatment of deep facts, such as &quot;the torpedo problem;&quot; there were three defects, not one.  But useful for description of horrors that rarely make it to the page--therefore a tribute to the suffering of brave men.  Useful also for clarifying Kurita's motives for withdrawal--he was afraid of air atack from both land-based and sea-based planes, given that he had no air cover himself.  One cannot fairly ascribe Kurita's decision to inscrutability while simultaneously declaring that surface-to-surface fleet actions had been made obsolete by air power.  Kurita knew this, did what he could &amp; saved what he could.  The larger American destroyers DID look like cruisers in his experience.  He wasn't timid or a fool; to claim he was unfairly dims the achievement of those who opposed him.  Hornfischer doesn't fall into this trap.<br />On the whole, a good read, the best on the battle so far.  Well written, poetic in places (&quot;scintillan sun&quot;) and well edited, if underpunctuated.	2004-05-01

Redundancy makes for tedium in this book. Far from being &quot;a book which matches and complements that bestseller of the postwar years, The Cruel Sea,&quot; as the usually meticulous Len Deighton claims, the book rises to that level only when selections from that book are presented. The stories are interesting, mostly. They demonstrate, again, that England, not the United States, won the battle of the Atlantic, and they show how brave men suffered. But the book's strategy, following the career of one class of destroyers, limits its scope and pool of potential readers. Also ideosyncratic are its appendices--nautical terms, histories for ships mentioned, and obituaries of key figures. But these are welcome; I could do without verses, though, as none can be confused with poetry. It's well that the profits from the book sale will be used to restore &quot;the sole remaining Second World War British destroyer.&quot;	2004-05-01

The book is about two sociopathic mass murderers interacting with each other.  The first third is about what they do and think.  Just when I thought the top of my head was going to come off, focus shifts to detectives who are trying to put the crazies behind bars--good instinct on Wambaugh's part.  The book reads like a \\"Dragnet\\" script--\\"just the facts, Ma'am, just the facts\\"--but in a curious style:  \\"Dragnet\\" scripted by Phillip Roth or Terry Southern.  The eye for detail that Waumbaugh ascribes to one character is his own, and a sharp eye it is, too.  References to literature show he's done his reading.  Reading this book is like sliding down a razorblade; there's blood all over, but you don't feel a thing.	2004-02-23

In &quot;Harry's Gloom,&quot; he finds purgatory, when unable to create significance.  Here, he finds heaven, by recognizing and memorializing moments of happiness, often tiny, until they merge.<br />\\"All you need to be happy,\\" says Harry, \\"is to notice when you're happy.\\"  His Zen-like method commemorates precisely, but presents the problem of how to represent joy without being boring, since \\"happy families are all alike.\\"  Sutton's method was &quot;to not bore myself; this improves the odds you'll enjoy reading.&quot;<br />John Berryman advised Sutton to &quot;Start at the beginning, go to the end, in order, about what matters.&quot;  What matters to Sutton is  &quot;my nation's shame and pride, my career (RIP), loss and love, poetry's health, life's domesticities, and endings.&quot;  His is an odd voice, part Emily Dickenson and part Lenny Bruce, or as he puts it &quot;S.J. Perelman reading Dr. Seuss.&quot;  This isn't boring, but one is right to ask why he chose such a demanding form in a time that has no standards.  Perhaps that's the reason.  Nowadays, anyone can write poetry; few can write sonnets.  Almost no one writes them so effortlessly the reader forgets their form.  Sutton's conversational tone fuses thought, feeling and action within a form that gives permanence and sting, effortlessly.  The result comments on popular culture, but is as far from it as one can be in a land where vomit on a sidewalk is viewed as Art.	2004-01-09

He promises, in his introduction, to relate the events of his life with emotions he felt at the time without irony, but his detatchment to events in his own life makes it impossible for him to keep his pledge.  Irony is his lens on the world, and he must see through it, darkly, or grope blindly. Pain comes through--the pain of childhood, pain of attending school where his father was headmaster, pain of academic boredom long after he'd outgrown it, pain of rootlessness, many failures--as if he were betrayed by experience itself. His writing, in his two autobiographies, shows the craftsmanship that made him famous, but fails to sparkle like the prose in his fiction, as if he were off-duty. He seems to have embraced Catholicism for the same reason Wordsworth wrote sonnets, for form; it doesn't seem to have been a passion, but perhaps it would have been bad form to say so. Worth reading for insights into his friendships and characters.	2003-09-23

Was writing his cover for travel?  Does boredom fully explain his uncanny knack for being in troubled places in troubled times?<br />No matter.  He was a great stylist and craftsman.

This book, which follows Dr. Gurewitch's book on Farce, surveys Irony from its benevolent form (approaching Humor) through Pyrronic and cosmic forms to its most unredemptive nihilistic expression. He illustrates with concrete literary references drawn from western literature, both American and Continental, ancient and modern, mostly novels but, now and then, a play or poem. He weighs major critics as he examines works that illustrate, gainsay or amplify their received wisdom. If he favors Freud, this is not merely a reflection of the psychosexual side of his subject, but a judgement that the approach best explains the issue at hand.  Oddly, no psychologist after Freud is mentioned, as if Adler and particularly Maslow do not apply. But one can't read everything, particularly since half of everything written has been written in the last seven years. Still, Dr. Gurewitch has read almost everything about Irony, taken notes, identified issues, and illuminated them with figures and configurations that are apt and convincing. He writes with verve, in periodic sentences that confound short attention spans, with adjectives that illuminate suddenly. He knows more about Irony than the critics he mentions; he knows more about Comedy than anyone in North America. His style and outlook reflect high criticism, a relief from deconstructionism and perhaps a resistance to it, in view of a citation or two that generate irony of their own. Not for beginners, this book is a two course graduate sequence in Irony. One must have read widely in European and American Literature to follow the book's analysis. For those with background, the result is what scholarship should be--the aftertaste of a fine wine savored with the faintest of smiles.	2003-07-31

Like Michael Corleone, what Bonanno did to preserve his family destroyed it; like Corleone, once he got involved, he couldn't get out. This explains his fatalistic feeling that his role in life was preordained at birth.<br />Contrary to other reviews here, Bonanno DOES give new details, like why Bugsy Seigal was killed and who the second shooter was in Dallas. His explanation of who killed the Kennedys and why is worth the price of the book. He shouldn't be expected to give details about his own capers, not only because this would be self-incriminating, but because he was a strategist, not a soldier or capo. He's a policy wonk of crime.<br />He says the U.S. Government is the biggest mob around. If true, this not only justifies why Sicilians are as they are, but burdens the rest of us with a warning. Even if false, it indavertently supports his point that &quot;the life&quot; came to an end when those practicing it entered into a war of attrition with a foe more capable of maintaining it. Maybe greed wasn't to blame; maybe it was hubris.<br />Even if the book is self-serving or written for profit, that it exists is omerta's epitaph. It demonstrates that action for its own sake can be as addictive as heroin and harder to shake. It restates two great truths--&quot;whatever is taken by force must be maintained by force&quot; and &quot;force feeds on force.&quot; It also proves that two cultures can't exist in the same place at the same time; one absorbs the other or eliminates it. A war between the Mafia and America could end in only one way. Bonanno says that his father knew this; I believe him.	2003-06-25

Both are narrative, but Puzo's characters are rounder; neither is dramatic.<br />Breslin is fun when he writes about those who connive against interest.

His gift is tapping memory for an image, a smell, a habit; and making just-in-time connections--gangster trading cards undoing the mob. But zip in his prose has gone missing. Maybe New York has changed for him, too, and his point, that the world of the mob was its own undoing, applies to him. The Gotham he loved is gone, and he mourns like Damon Runyon.	2003-06-06

Morton Gurewitch divides Comedy into four impulses--Irony, Satire, Humor and Farce--and examines their submanifestations. He relates literary and dramatic works to the comic theories to which they pertain. His thesis--that comedy is essentially irrational--is most easily demonstrated by farce, and it is farce that gets most of his attention.<br />I wish he had included a taxonomy of the phyla he discusses (although I know why he didn't--too mechanistic, given his subject); that he had included more on Comedia; that he had referenced cinematic works; that he had examined timelines between theories and works they reference for pattern (are theorists always at least fifty years behind what they study?); and that he had used Adler and Maslow as well as Freud. I also wish that, after tracing adultery through Western literature, he had favored me with his view of this most conventional of unconventional behaviors, for there must be a satyr in those who study satyrs. But this book is a comprehensive analysis of comedy and its theorists in Western literature from Greece to now by one who has spent a lifetime studying both.<br />The book makes academic history, too. While English Departments were committing academic suicide--by alienating the creative element of their profession with culture wars, puritanism, and even more spiritually debilitating forms of reductionism, one scholar was constorting with its essence, the idea that Literature should be enjoyed. His style is itself a revolt against monstrous monotony. He delights in turning a phrase, demonstrating how adjectives should be used, and baffling the befuddled with periodic sentences. But his main achievement is using concrete literary reference to build a coherent and comprehensive account of what comedy is and where it has been.<br />A century ago, such a book would have made him famous, because it would have been read by intellectuals on three continents and hailed as a work of genius. Today, his reward is limited to whatever comfort his own theory can generate. There must be some. After all, he's writing about comedy in a culture that thinks satire is a hate crime.to whatever comfort his own theory can generate. There must be some.

Patton didn't get it and hated Mauldin for undermining the kind of authority that Patton loved and G.I.'s hated, authority for its own sake.

What remains in the mind are his admonitions that (1) one should know one's enemy, and (2) one should defeat him without humilating him. Also, that two cannot compete in the same place at the same time, whether alpha males or nations. But even this is simplistic. Dominant cultures first try to absorb indigenous populations, then enslave them, then displace them, and annihilate them only when the cultural gap is so large that they can't be used. Wonderful style; expansive vocabulary (\\"yark,\\" \\"bogdle,\\" \\"calenture\\"); and a mind that remembered everything he read.	2003-01-05

Hard to believe it was written by someone uneducated, as its insights are intellectual and its metaphors breathtakingly poetic. Maybe it was ghostwritten, or complied from notes or a diary; or maybe it's a compilation of stories about many people applied to one. Or maybe it is what it seems, the worst outcome, because it shocks by illustrating how far life can sink when loss desensitizes.  As it turns out, it's a novel, but so convincing it reads like a biography.<br />The dynamic is interesting: giving nothing (sex) for something (money) allows the exploited to feel in control, when there is no control. And her rant about hypocrisy not only demonstrates class hatred, but seems a pitiful rationalization for reducing our best emotion to a transaction. The real dynamic is allegiance for protection, inevitable in the abused.<br />I had to read slowly, because the text over-powers. No question, though: It's one of a kind, and a bargain, if only because it makes us thankful for lives we didn't lead. Is \\"she\\" an intellectual or just French?

In it, he mentions that the U.S. Navy had broken the Japanese Navy Code. This information would have been valuable to the Japanese, if it had fallen into their hands. Thus, inadvertently, his diary affirms the wisdom of the regulation he ignored.<br />How could he have known that the Code had been broken, in only the second year of the war? (1) from an officer; (2) from his close friend in the radio shack; (3) or by guessing. The first is most likely, as his diary seems replete with information broadcast over his ship's loudspeaker. But (4) maybe information was added to his text after the war. Samuel Eliot Morrison wrote the introduction; did he edit it, too?<br />This diary is unique in that it views the Pacific War from the perspective of an ordinary seaman. Some things come through that aren't mentioned in other biographies or official histories. Swabbies were hungry, most of the time. Vermin infested stores. Sailors got less than two hours sleep per day for long periods. They slept on decks in the tropics: no air conditioning. A match left on the deck would ignite. Firing five-inch guns deafened sailors near them, permanently. Loading stores and thousands of shells was exhausting. Boredom, fatigue, typhoons, accidents assailed them. Fahey's personal phobia was sharks.<br />He documents how sailors suffered. To keep going as they did, they needed assurance that what they were doing was worthwhile, that they were appreciated, and that they had a chance for surviving. His diary shows that he received all three. The proof is that he repeated what his officers told him.	2002-10-27

The only action the author saw was the rescue of the crew of a stricken destroyer, so this is NOT a WWII action-adventure tale.  Like all autobiographies, what the author reveals about himself, deliberately or inadvertently, stands at the center of the book, as it demonstrates how character controls fate.  This is a book by a reserve officer; a career officer would never report that the crew cheered to hear that their captain had been relieved.  The author took his membership in a college fraternity seriously, networking with brothers across the Pacific, often to advantage.  He mentions brothels, admits visiting & never admits going upstairs.  The gentleman is indiscrete, about others.  It was interesting to read about the famous disruption of fleet exercises by small ships in transit by one who was on one of the small ships.  And the book testifies to the experience of many who were civilians at heart, but served effectively.  I would have liked more about what his communications ship coordinated during an actual amphibious landing, but that knowledge wasn't forthcoming.  All in all, an easy read by the kind of officer who wins wars, even if he doesn't get shot at.	2002-09-22

But he attended Trinity Church (the Anglican cathedral in Copley Square), not the Church of the Advent (across the street from his house). He chose to worship where he might be seen. Power was one of his priorities, and so was his career.<br /><br /> Some claim he was given access to documents that were withheld from other historians. Even if untrue, the suspicion behind this claim is that Morison did not always lay responsibility at the right flag. Those who read carefully will want to keep this in mind as they scan the best survey of naval operations in the two ocean war--unrivaled for scope, detail and appreciations.<br /><br /> A serious student would start with Morison's history, but not finish there. Also, there are unusual issues of character. Is this an officer you'd want to follow into combat? What does this have to do with his objectivity as a reporter of naval operations? Do blind spots issue from his New England mindset? Should he really be compared to Thucydides, or is he more like Kipling? Or was it about academic oneupsmanship? How does his son's tragedy relate to the father's achievement? Heavy issues, these; but they pertain, unfortunately.	2002-02-18

Its dust jacket claims that this book \\"is much more than a simple war memoir.\\"  Notwithstanding, it IS a simple war memoir. It sheds light on a theater of war that was far from action, most of the time.  It's the story of an education, as many good books are. It demonstrates what wins wars.<br />  As with most memoirs, the author's fate is controled by his character. He follows orders to absurdity, like seeking competitive bids from a monopoly; like accounting for departures from orders as if seeking dispensation from mortal sin; like signing for equipment without understanding what he was signing for; like taking duty, when asked, as others went ashore because he was a bachelor and then resenting those helped for renigging on promises of reciprocity.  The man and his role are one.<br />  The author may have been assimilated too successfully by the Naval Academy.  He mirrors its strengths and weaknessess--devotion to duty, hard work and a \\"can do\\" attitude on the one hand; racism, cronyism and prejudice on the other--not personal racism, but the kind that comes with colonialism.  The book is a microcosm of what the navy FELT like before the world changed around it.  It's a history of the heart, not what the author intended.<br />  The book's account of operations and life in Australia add little to naval history.  It doesn't deal with strategy; but it does give a feel for life and operations on Australia's drab west coast. Inadvertently, it suggests that Japan could have had at least part of that continent for the taking, if it had mastered maritime logistics and made better use of its shipping.  Maybe an invasion of Australia was a closer call than most appreciate. Those who study operations may compare the author's view to accounts by those who proposed and attempted to develop Exmouth as a submarine base.  Life looks different from the deck.<br />  This book is an easy read.  Many naval officers write well, perhaps because they write many reports carefully to those who read carefully.  But the text is flawed by orthographic and typographical errors, as if spelling utilities didn't exist.  This is an oddly constant feature of autobiographies by naval officers.<br />  Someone may have prevailed on the author to imitate John Dos Passos by starting each chapter with a newsreel-like account of what was going on in the war and the world at each chapter's timeframe.  A scaffold is a good way to get a ship started, but should be removed after construction.<br />  Many of the text's homely interrogatories remain rhetorical. Modest research could have answered these questions.  If MEANT to be unanswered, perhaps they should have remained unasked.  The speculative fatalism they convey contributes little to the story--certainly not local color or literary style.  But this officer might be uncomfortable with flair.<br />  Textual flaws aside, the book does not portray the sort of officer who makes history, but the sort that makes navies and wins wars.  Like the history of the U.S.S. Salt, the book signifies BECAUSE of the author's solid performance in a marginal theater of war.  Also, it reminds that war is boredom punctuated by terror.  And it testifies to the seaman's love for seamanship.<br />  Biographies by naval officers never include fitness reports or information on what others thought about them.  As character is the center of any autobiography, one suspects that a memoir could be enriched mightily by allowing for multiple points-of-view.  The first one who does this will establish that the issue was never the war, but the growth of heart and mind in action.  With respect to \\"Officer of the Deck,\\" such information, like the title itelf, might well have established the positive side of what is meant by \\"typical.\\"ose who read carefully.

Many naval officers write well, pehaps because they write many reports carefully to those who read carefully. This book is well written. Schratz's report on his corner of WWII and the occupation of Japan is worth reading. His take on the torpedo problem--and the solution he implemented at the edge of his orders--is unique. His report on certain incidents of command and loyalty add to those extant. His explanation on the possible cause of the Tonkin Gulf incident is worth the price of the book. This officer has understanding and insight. He's committed to making a contribution and leaving a legacy. But he doesn't express this directly, and this raises character as an issue. As a naval officer, he's efficient, effective, innovative and exacting. He knows that healthy organizations have fun, including shipboard organizations, so he plays hard, but doesn't let play stand in the way of work and is uncompromisingly severe on those who do. He knows the difference between a wartime navy and a peacetime navy, between bureaucratic tactics that get one promoted and what happens if one tries to use them in battle. He knows better than to use the same plan twice. His conscience makes him uncomfortable when action puts him on the wrong side of his values or when justice and regulations conflict. Basically, he favors thinking and acting \\"outside the box\\" whenever the box keeps him from carrying out his mission, broadly defined. He presents himself as a black sheep for doing so; and yet, read carefully, each of his forays into apparent undisciplined self-indulgence have the effect of producing pride, increasing morale, bonding shipmates together, and ultimately placing his superiors in a good light. What's odd is that he doesn't take credit for these as willful achievements, but invites us to treat them as unruly and undisciplined, as if initiative and command were antithetical. It's possible that he's unaware of his own character, but unlikely. What we have here is a man who doesn't want others to know who the inner man is and is willing to derogate himself so as to put others on the wrong track, all except those who love him for himself rather than for his role, to which he refuses to succumb--avoiding numbness. Far from being untypical of naval officers--whom he sees as conformist, he is typical of certain kind of non-conforming officer that American naval tradition produces in abundance: daring, resourceful, unwilling to let protocol inhibit effectiveness or survival, willing to work hard and play hard, willing to cut the Gordian Knot with pleasure. My guess is that, under his flash and feathers, the gentleman is as shy as a violinist. He'd be interesting to meet. If I'm right, he's already read enough comments about his book to wonder, out loud, whether anyone who commits memoirs to paper is a fool . . . while taking secret comfort in the fact that no one has found him out.

His basic premise about jurors: If he can get them to imagine, he can get them to doubt.  So his approach, always personal, was perpetually appealing to imagination.  It worked, mostly, even when clients were guilty.  It's his reliance on reason that makes him a skeptic.  Causation is the basis of his world and personal views. Seeing the effect of the law, he argues that judging is worse than judgement, and he would dispense with both.  He is at some pain to describe what he gave up to plead, rather than the life he gained by it.  His seriousness can be attributed to the injustices he saw, effects he attributes more to chance than choice.  He espouses the theory of continental drift, in 1939! A sharp mind interested in everything.  As he says himself, if he had to do it over, . . . he'd have been a scientist.	2001-12-11

(1) Rommell wasn't a genius, but impetuous and overreaching; much of his success came from reading Allied signals. (2) German generals overcredited the effectiveness of Russian artillery for their defeat. (3) The German campaign in Greece didn't delay invasion of Russia or cost Germany the war. (4) Churchill was vain-glorious. (5) Hitler was taking amphetamines for a heart ailment! Consistent with his theme, Deighton is least forgiving to those who falsified or destroyed records from self-interest. Well researched, and broader in reference than most military history, the book critically evaluates personalities, strategies and key decisions. It is unusual for its point-of-view--the professional intellegence analyst who estimates dispassionately, deleting passion to comprehend reality. A hard-headed contribution to what was done or left undone, and written with skill.	2001-05-22

This book is unlike most first-person accounts of sea duty during WWII. It includes aspects of seamanship and detail that don't ordinarily make it to the page. It expresses the exuberance and wonder of a young naval officer, despite having been written from the vantage of maturity. Perhaps this is because it was written from the author's contemporaneous ships' logs, but may be intended to relate experiences together with original feelings and attitudes. This has charm. It's self-effacing rather than self-important. One listens more closely, as to a youngster. The book deals with the Allied occupation of Japan; this is unusual, too. Also, the author's preference for Spruance over Halsey, shared by many, but expressed by few. The author served on one ship throughout the war.  His theme comes through clearly: Many more served than saw action. The greater threat was boredom, not terror. Well written, though its language is a bit stiff; interesting; useful for young officers, as a guide to getting along. Demonstrates &quot;can do&quot; attitude of those who served on destroyers, including reservists.	2001-05-09

He's the one who thought up \\"bombing\\" American bombers from above, without prior approval from headquarters, with consequences that illlustrate why Germany lost the war: It was over-organized.He must have known about deportation of Jews; he may not have known about extermination as public policy, as he was immersed in fighting.

Morrison was first to write about naval operations in WWII because he was able to monopolize materials at the expense of others.  He writes with the jingoism of one who was fired upon and never got over it.  Careful about his own career and politics attendant thereto, he isn't as objective as he might be about those with whom he served.  While no Thucydides, he's still the one to read first for an overview of &quot;the two ocean war,&quot; but records not available when he wrote have revised his estimates. Also, the aim of all Morrison's works is to establish the U.S. as the cultural and military equal of European powers.  When one starts with a conclusion, it tends to color one's logic.  Something to keep in mind while reading him: Would you want to go into battle under his command?  Your answer speaks volumes.	2001-03-20

Many who teach creative writing claim they teach &quot;close reading.&quot;  Their idea is that one can't improve as a writer unless one is able to correct mistakes, and one can't correct mistakes unless one notices them.  Pound's book is about noticing. Whether one acts on what one notices is a matter of style, and there's no arguing with that; but there's also no arguing that Pound covers most of the elements of style that anyone--writer or reader--will need. (Karl Shapiro's Primer covers the rest.)  This book changes the way one looks at literature, writing and life.  Most books about writing aren't worth reading; this one is essential, particularly for those who judge literature on the basis of their own social values.	2000-10-03

It captured the feel of the Beach and the people in it, but the structure of the book was confusing; hard to figure out who was speaking when. And the characters weren't that interesting. There was someting academic about the writing, like function following form, as if it had been written to an outline. It wasn't \\"the Godfather.\\"	2000-09-26

This is a solid piece of cut-and-paste research and the best one-volume on Lansky. But it won't satisfy those who have read Lacey's sources and are looking for something new. What was it about the wiseguy lifestyle that made it attractive, especially to the sons of immigrants? Why did Lansky need the discipline of omerta? There's no insight into Meyer's personality, just facts. Lacey does not have all the facts. He doesn't mention that Bugsy Seigal was skimming, ripping off his partners, and had left a fortune with Jimmy the Greek for safekeeping. But Lacey puts big issues into perspective: the disorganization of organized crime; the lack of scope in Lansky's genius; the misinformation in reputable newspapers; the distortive and corrosive effect of secrecy on politics; and Meyer's lack of luck, in life and love. No wonder; Lansky valued being a stand-up guy over life or love, and paid the price for it. His motivation was simple: to get out of the ghetto. Those who have been there know the dynamics of this imperative and the power it has over those who accept the challenge \\"by any means necessary\\" as a method of survival. Lacey doesn't get it; and so, while he avoids easy answers and moralistic traps, he misses the juice of what made Lansky sizzle.	2000-09-26

This has been done before, by Dos Passos and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and when it is done well, it creates fast-paced action; when done badly, it produces thin characters with little motivation.  That could be the case here, but I'm not sure, because I got the point. America has changed, again, and so have the wiseguys in it. Still, I have trouble believing that a &quot;man of respect&quot; could marry a woman that he had employed as a whore and decoy. Unless Puzo's point is that, finally, one don wised up enough to choose love over money and power! Read carefully; this book is more complex than it looks. It may have been written in haste, with one eye on the film rights, but so was &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; whose characters are minimalist, too, by design.	2000-09-26

The texts of many Eighteenth Century books are full of interpolations by printers and may contain thousands of edits by the author, too. What Dr. Brack does in his scholarly editions is identify and evaluate EVERY variant to assemble a DEFINITIVE TEXT. He spent a lifetime tracking down what Smollett actually wrote. If you want to know what Smollet wrote, not his printer, read an edition that Dr. Brack has collated; they're triumphs of scholarship as well as a service to readers.	2000-05-03

He objected to compulsory suicide as official doctrine, because he saw this as a violation of bushido values. He turned pacifist BEFORE the Bomb. His personal doctrines demonstrate why the Japanese lost the war--they were inflexible. Hara wasn't. His doctrines were &quot;Never ever do the same thing twice&quot; and &quot;If he hits you high, then hit him low; if he hits you low, then hit him high,&quot; the latter a maxim of MacArthur's, too. Hara criticizes his superiors for using cavalry tactics to fight naval battles; never understanding the implications of air power; dividing their forces in the face of enemy forces of unknown strength; basing tactics on what they thought their enemy would do; and acceping a war of attrition with a foe more capable of maintaining it. His technical discussions are superb. What gives the book significance is his explication of strategy/tactics and their implications. Hara is a brave man who knew WHY he did what he did. This puts him in a minority, in any navy.	2000-04-15

When life is a personal movie, a poet is his own reviewer. Mike Lally's title,&quot;It's Not Nostalgia,&quot;  suggests that if he had to do it again, he wouldn't. What he does here is lay his life bare, to himself and  anyone who listens.  His life is wild and atypical, from playing piano with  his feet in a 'Fifties band, to poet and protester in the 'Sixties,  bisexual, and movie actor, all the while cupid's priest. None of it is  fiction.  He was where the action was, in front of whatever parade streamed  from the spiritual lobes of a decade, trying to supply direction to his  life and the undirected forces of his time. What does HE get out of living  like a leaf in a windstorm? The ride, the ride. What he gives me, by  example, is the courage to tell myself what I hide from myself.  Loss is  what it means to live in interesting times. There are things he hasn't  resolved, failing his first marriage; why he needs to feel and be known as  hip. But there's more that he's unravelled--in particular, the knowledge  that it's the narrative itself that creates meaning from experience. His  writing is aesthetically and historically true; and he pays a price for  telling it straight. As he says, of himself, &quot;...he had missed his  chance for fame and lasting authority when he had decided to remain true to  his experiences and perceptions. Distortion was the basis for  success,...&quot;  That is the sound of an American needle piercing an  Irish heart.	2000-04-12

But writing shows inexperience, and asides from author to reader are gauche and jejune. Ending seems unmotivated: why return to a radio station in flames? Fictionalizing of  historical fact is well done, but invention would have been better. Female  lead character is precious. Oddly, characters are most believable when  bizarre, as if author finds it difficult to deal with what's normal. Worth  reading author's next novel; this one a transition piece, because labored  and flawed.	2000-03-31

The angel moves to Paris, meets a woman, has his wings fall off &amp; takes up the harp to make a living, since he can't handle harmony. Then he meets the Devil.  This is a very funny book, by the world's greatest ironist. A wonderful read for those who smile at people who pray on TV while squinting. Elegant prose even in English, better in French; a quintessential skeptic at his best.	1999-01-16

See Dentatus Vaginus legend in the Index of Folk Motif Literature for the connection with teeth; he mentions that in the book, too. Berryman consciously wrote of & for intellectual history, and it shows in this book. A man of letters, in a time that had waning interest in such, he describes his cross-motivation like a noble mind o'erthrown, in media autovivisectu.
