Isabel Hull exposes the flaw of this approach in her book. Accroding to Hull, German soldiers committed numoerous atrocities from the Herro uprising to the First World War due to belief in absolute victory and the absence of civilian supervision. This was seen in the destruction of the Herro tribe in which the Germans delibrately starved the tribe to death, and the complaints by the civilian governors were ignored by the German government. The German government imposed no controls on the military because the conservative political parties supported the army and the SPD did not want to appear as though they were not supporting the troops. The German army continued these same practices during the First World War through the massacre of Belgian civilians, and the expulsion of French civilians. Also the German army encouraged the Turks in their genocide against the Armenians. These measures only tarnished Germany's reputation and were militarily counterproductive. I would strongly reccomend this book to people like Robert Kaplan, who wants the military to run wild in foreign adventures.	2005-10-13

Reese mantains that the Soviet officer corps lacked a professional sense of identity since Soviet officers had to be members of the Communist party and this involved them in interparty disputes further political commissars with no professional abilities could be generals. Soviet officers also used commissars to try to impose order in the ranks and this made them fail to have any sense of group identity with the ranks. Furthermore, this neglect of enlisted men, made it possible for abuse to occur betweem NCOs and lower ranking members of the Red army. Soviet officers also did not develop small unit tactics that required individual intiative, and this greatly impeded the effectiveness of the Red Army throughout its history. The only weakness of the book is that Reese leaves out the reason why that the Soviet officer corps managed to conduct effective strategic moves, such as the 1944 summer offensive,  during the Second World while failed in the area of tactics. I would greatly reccomend this book for anyone has an interest Russian military history.	2005-09-09

Jefferson abandoned his decentralizing inclinations during his presidential tenure by imposing a nationwide embargo against Great Britain and by including northern members in his Republican party thereby creating the basis for a national political party. Jefferson's successor Madison further advance the centralization of government by laying the basis for a national credit system and by using regular as opposed to militia forces during the War of 1812. Wills believes that Adams main purpose was to show that the founders were not bracketed in either Hamiltonian or Jefferson camps and were actually very pragmatic men that adjusted to events. I would reccomend this book for anyone who wants a new perspective of Henry Adams and his view of the founding fathers.	2005-09-09

Nicolson writes the main reason British admirals and captians took extreme risks with their lives and reputations in battle was due to the fact that a great percentage of them came from middle class backgrounds and deperately needed advancement in the Royal Navy. Nicolson also argues the English Romantic movement which stressed masculinity and rejected the effeminate styles of the Enlightenment, also played a role in motivating English officers. Nicolson believes French officers were less agressive because they emphasized the Romantic notion of dying in a doomed battle. I would strongly reccomend this book to anyone who wants a new perspective of Trafalgar, but I would suggest that those who do not have strong foundation in European history might have a difficult time understanding such terms in the book such as the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement.	2005-08-28

According to Pape suicide terrorism occurs when there is an occupation of the terrorists homeland by a foreign power of a different religion. Pape dismisses the notion that suicide terrorists are proverty stricken loners, because most of the research now indicates that a great percentage of those willing to become suicide terrorists are highly respected members of the middle class in their countries. Pape is also critical of the reasons that stress religious upringing in motivating suicide attacks since Islamic fundamentalists from North Africa and Iran do not commit suicide attacks, but Christian Lebanonese were willing to become suicide bombers for Hezbollah in the eighties. Pape writes that suicide attackers come from states that were under foreign occupation such as Lebanon and who feel colonized by the presence of American troops such as Saudi Arabia. The solution to the problem of suicide terrorism Pape writes is to withdraw military forces from Iraq and Saudi Arabia while offshoring military equippment in case a crisis emerges in the future. With the absence of American presence and greater Homeland security the recruits for suicide terrorism will dry up. Overall, Pape makes a great point that the military strategies used by Bush and Blair which are advocated by scholars such as John Gaddis is heading America for certain defeat unless the American government heeds Pape's advice.	2005-07-22

According to Porter, the origins of US involvement in the Vietnam War, was not the domino theory but a fear of American allies such as Thailand switiching sides from a strong US ally toward having a neutral position with the Chinese if South Vietnam fell.American national security adivisors feared that if Thailand was to become neutral than Chinese infleunce would expand in the region. Another ineteresting contention of Porter's book is that the Vietnamese, Chinese, and the Russians would have signed on to a treaty that would have left a neutral but non-Communist South Vietnam due to their fear of American power. But the American national security establishment thought any neutral South Vietnam could be under the influence of the Chinese and rejected such offers. I would reccomend this book for anyone who are interested in not only the origins of the Vietnam War, but the Second Iraq War as well.	2005-07-09

Truman could have included the Soviet Union in the Postdam Declarartion thereby ending Japanese hopes that the Soviets could act as a neutral power in designing a peace settlement. Or Truman had the option of allowing the emperor stay as a figurehead in the peace terms. Truman ignored these options and wanted to drop the atomic bomb in order to prevent the Soviets from entering the war. Also the author does not give a positive light on Stalin or the emperor, Stalin deceived the Japanese by stating that he was interested in peace in the Pacific while preapring for war and the emperor sided with the hardliners until the very end. As a previous reviewer mentioned it was the Soviet offensive in Manchuria that led to the Japanese capitulating and not the the atomic bomb. I would strongy reccomend this book to anyone who wants a new perspective on Truman.	2005-06-27

During the intial planning of the Somme offensive Haig did not develop an effective bombardment plan that would neutralize the German defenses. As a result thousands of British soldiers were killed in the opening phases of the campaign by German defenses that managed to survive the massive British bomdardment. But this bomdbardment was very ineffective because the artillery failed to cooperate with the infantry and this led to gunners missing their target but a large margin. Haig continued his errors by believing that the battle could be a Napoleonic type of decisive victory and this made him to commit thousands of troops to a stalemated camapign. The only weakness of the book is that the authors leave out the French and German perspectives of the camapaign, but otherwise this is an excellent account of the battle.	2005-06-27

According to Rodger the reasons for British naval superiority were better maintanence, superior ship design, more effective officer training, and improved health measures. The British were able to keep their ships afloat because they invested a great deal of money in buiding docks that were able to fix ships of the line as opposed to the French, who sacrificed dock building in favor of making new ships. The British also had rugged ships that with bronze plating could outrun their French counterparts that were of a lighter design. British officer training was more practical since it was aboard ships as opposed to the classroom eduction of the French officers. Finally the British were able to triumph over the French because they were able to keep their sailors healthy by a better diet than their French counterparts, and constantly cleaning the interiors of the ships as opposed to the French, who neglected these health measures.The main weakness of Rodger's book is that he seems to gloss over British naval operations, but despite this weakness, Rodger gives credible reason why the Royal Navy defeated the French on consistent basis.	2005-04-17

According to Palmer there was an debate about whether intiative should be left to individual captains or the commanding admiral. Palmer believes that the British used decentralized tactics effectively against the French who were tied to centralized command during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Pamler writes that the use of decentralized tactics depended on an educated officer corps since when the French admiral Suffren tried British tactics he failed miserably due to an lack of individual intiative among the French officers. During the First World War, the British adopted centralized tactics and this hampered their performance during the Battle of Jutland. However in the Second World War, the British used decentralized tactics successfully against the Italians. Both the Americans and the Japanese used decentralized tactics during the Pacific War, but the Germans used a centralized approach that left them vulnerable to allied radio interception. The only weakness of this book is that Palmer leaves out the curriculum of naval officer cadet schools and how this influenced the tactical approach of opposing fleets. Nevertheless this book is an excellent account of different types of naval leadership.	2005-03-11

The first two chapters of the book, the authors describe how the European powers cooperated with the Native Americans in order to acheive their aims. But after the Seven Years War, the colonists viewed British cooperation with natives as impeding their drive westward. During the Revolutionary War, Americans ethnically cleansed thousands of Native Americans in order to defend their individual rights to expand westward. George Washington tried tired to slowly assimilate Native Americans to embrace ideas of freedom and democracy, but his plans fell apart due to the violent actions by Scotch-Irish settlers and later by Andrew Jackson's policies in the western borderlands. Grant tried to implement Washington's program after the Civil War, but did nothing to prevent the expulsion of the Native Americans from their lands. The same policies that Washington and Grant used on the Native Americans expanded to the Phillippines and Cuba in which the interests of these citizens were subordinated to the wishes of the United States. MacArthur followed similiar actions in his dealings with the Japanese after the Second World War in which he repressed  some Japanese publications because they were against the interests of the United States. The main weakness of this book is that the first two chapters of the book does not flow with the remaining chapters and that the authors don't compare the American empire with its European counterparts in the nineteenth century. Otherwise this book strongly disputes writings by the likes of William Kristol on the right, and Samantha Powers on the left, that advocate the use of American military force in order to spread individual freedom.	2005-01-07

Moreover,Pemberton was unable to react to Grant's moves, but Grant was looking for new innovative moves to distract and outflank the Confederates. Naval power also played a key role in helping Grant transport troops and block reinforcements from entering Vicksburg.

According to Hastings the Western allies missed numerous opportunities to conquer Germany such as after the capture of Aachen and the Battle of the Bulge. Moreover the Western allies were too reliant on firepower and not able to improvise in combat. Hastings also chatises Soviet miltitary abiltity as well, by criticizing the decision to halt the advance into Berlin by pausing to reinforce the northern flank, and Zhukov's frontal attack on that city. Hastings writes that the allies committed numerous atrocities such as bombing and strafing civilians while the Russians crucified and raped women.Plus Hastings questions the morality of the Western allies by provoking the doomed Warsaw rebellion without having the means to support it. The main fault of Hastings's work is that he leaves out the siege of Budapest and ignores the works by David French, Peter Mansoor, and Michael Doubler that contradict his thesis about the military abilties of the Western allies. Despite these criticisms, I would reccomend this book for those who want a new perspective on the Second World War.	2004-12-06

Sir Francis Drake and others severly damaged the Spanish economy by interrupting the flow of silver and gold from South America. The English stopped the French in the Seven Years War by using the Navy to takeover France's colonial possessions in the Americas.The Royal Navy also was able to defeat Napolean by breaking down his Continental System through blockading the whole of Europe. Herman also stated that the Royal Navy was able to promote nineteenth century values by stopping the slave trade and piracy while helping Greece and the newly independent South American countries achieve their goals of self determination. Finally, Herman believes that the main reason the Royal Navy decayed in the twentieth century was due to a lack of funding. Although this book is very readable, Herman makes significant errors in his book. In his analysis of the Napoleonic wars, Herman asserts that naval power was cheaper than land power and thereby England could retain its system of a low taxed and decentralized state. But the British historian Nial Ferguson points out that the British government during the Napoleonic era raised taxes significantly and became more centralized. Also Herman seems to believe that seapower alone could win wars, but in the Seven Years and Napoleonic Wars, Britain was allied with major European land powers, and in the War for Independence, which it lost, and in the near defeat of the Boer War, Britain was allied with no continental nations. Plus Herman's  contention that the British Navy suffered in the Second World War due to a lack of funding ignores the fact that the British were preparing for another Jutland, and didn't pay enough attention to the advances in submarine and air warfare. Despite these major weaknesses, Herman has written an informative book that is very readable.	2004-11-30

According to Sugden, the main strengths of Nelson was his audacity and willingness to exploit the weaknesses of the French navy. Nelson displayed his audacity in storming forts in Central America and Corsica, stopping illegal trade in the Carribbean, and fighting the French navy. Nelson was also able to exploit the weaknesses of the French navy by aiming at their hulls, closing with the enemy, and abandoning the line. However, Sugden writes that Nelson's weaknesses was his constant search for glory that led to womanizing and allowing Prince George run amok while on his watch.

According to Marszalek, Halleck was severely handicapped by a hostile relationship with his father that later influenced his relations with subordinates. Marszalek believes that Halleck was unable to preasure McClellan,Buell, and Meade because they symbolized in Halleck's mind his own intimidating father. However, Halleck often acted like his father in relationships with Grant and Hooker by chatising them for their supposed sloppy behavior. The main weakness of the book is that Marszalek fails to account how institutional defects such as a lack of any post-graduate officer training that made Halleck, Buell, and McClellan share similar traits.Nevertheles this is an interesting account of how Halleck commanded the Union armies from 1862 to 1864.	2004-11-04

However the neighboring 203rd Security Division comitted more atrocities because it was closer to the front and had to compete with the SS in  order to curry favor in the high command.

Silverstone writes that the American presidency was handicapped in implementing agressive foreign policy designs due to a decentralized party system. Silverstone writes that from 1800-1812, the American government was relunctant to declare war against Great Britain due to oppostion from Northeastern polticians. In the 1840s Polk was forced to concede to the British over Oregon due to opposition in his own party from politicians in the Northeast and the Southern Coastal regions. Although Polk was able to declare war against the Mexicans, Northeasterners were able to limit the amount of Mexican land annexed by the Americans. These internal divisions prevented the United States from taking over Cuba in the 1850s. The only weakness of Silverstone's book is that he ignores the case of Andrew Jackson unilaterally taking over Florida and skims over how Polk pressured the Congress into declaring war with Mexico. But overall Silverstone has managed to discredit Gaddis's thesis that there was a set plan of preemption in American foreign policy during the nineteenth century.	2004-10-06

In the cases of Vietnam, the First World World War, and Iraq, overconfidence was the prime reason for these foreign policy disasters because all of the main characters in these cases ignored conflicting information and stifled dissent. Johnson argues that overconfident leaders believe that they can win any unwinnable conflict due to engrained genetice traits. However in the Munich and the Cuban Missile Crisis, leaders consulted with other members of the government, and this helped to diffuse any overconfidence amongst those in the cabinet. Some rightwinged readers might be offended by Johnson's praise of Chamberlain, but they should realize that both Britain and France lacked any significant ground forces during the Munich crisis to confront Germany. Moreover the nuance and willingness to listen to other viewpoints allowed John Kennedy to diffuse the Cuban Missile Crisis and save the world from nuclear destruction as mentioned in Johnson's book . However leaders that are narrowminded and overconfident such as L.B.J and G.W. Bush seemed unwilling to listen to contrary advice and prevent the nation from sufffering in two quagmires in Vietnam and Iraq. The main weakness of Johnson's book is that he skims over the reasons why the general public seems to have intially supported the fiascos in Iraq,Vietnam, and the First World War even when the casaulties began to pile up. I would reccomend this book to anyone who thinks that Bush's \\"strong,\\" character is a plus in foreign policy while Kerry's \\"nuance,\\" is a weakness.	2004-09-23

Overy claims that the Nazi party began to take over areas of the German economy while Stalin after the nineteen thirties left the economy in the hands of economist and engineers. Also during the war years the Nazi party was taking over control of  military operations, but Stalin was ceding control to his generals. The Gestapo was not constrained by any law while the Soviet NKVD in the early forties was scrutinize by some judicial oversight. Finallly the Nazis eliminated ethinic groups based on their race and the Soviets judged other ethinic groups based on their loyalty to the Soviet state. The main weakness of Overy's book is that he skims over Stalin's collectivization drive and how it resulted in the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens through stravation and repression.

According to Zamoyski, Napoleon invaded Russia in order to prevent an emerging independent European power that the nationalist in Germany could follow and also because Russia was breaking the Continental System. Russia declared war on France due to the French backing of Polish independence. Zamoyski is critical of Napoleon for committing too many troops to the invasion which strained the logistical system and impeded the advance of the French army. Also Napoleon missed many opportunities to surround the Russian and committed disasterous frontal attacks at Smolensk and Borodino and should have retreated from Moscow earlier in order to avoid the Russian winter. However, Zamoyski depicts the Russian high command as being plagued by constant infighting and missing chances to surround the French army. The main weakness of the book is that Zamoyski is too critcal of the Russian army and ignores important reforms in the Russian army such as a Corps system and a general staff which is mentioned in the works by Frederick Kagan. Nevertheless this book is a highly readable and informative account of Napoleon's Russian campaign.	2004-08-07

The first example that Biddle uses is the opening German offensive in 1918 against the British in which they succeded intially against the English army due to effective coordination of artillery and infantry. The second case that Biddle brings up is the British operation Goodwood against the Germans in 1944. The British failed, according to Biddle, due to the lack of cooperation between infantry and armor.Also Biddle dispels the myth that technology alone won Desert Storm because the Marines,equipped with only sixties era tanks, were able to defeat the Iraqis with superior tactics. The only weakness of Biddle's book is that he leaves out the two cases in which opponents with superior nummers defeated a force with effective force employment methods which is the defeat of the Germans to the Russians in the summer of 1944, and the rout of the Americans from North Korea by the Chinese in the winter of 1950. Otherwise, Biddle writes an effective case that force employment and not technology is the most important factor in military victory.	2004-07-26

Hamilton favored greater ties to England because the United States needed the English navy for its protection and England was the main market for American goods. Hamilton's pragmatic policies toward England were in direct contrast to the ideologically driven Jefferson who favored an impratical alliance with the French because France was a republic after 1792.Hamilton was also concerned about the French retaking Louisiana since this might threaten American interests in the southern part of the United States. However, after 1796, Hamilton's concerns were ignored by John Adams, who supported an alliance with France. The only weakness of this book is that Harper spends too much time describing the 1796 election which had little to do with the foreign policy issues mentioned in the rest of the book. Otherwise this is an extremely well written analysis of Hamilton's views on the foreign policy of the early Republic.	2004-06-03

The first factor according to Stevenson was the unreal war goals of both of the combatants. Another factor was that all of the great powers were able to keep large armies on the field for an indefinite amount of time due to advances in medicine. Military technology impeded further advances on the front since railways could transport troops to threatend sectors of the front and thereby making any future breathroughs by either side impossible. The final factors was the support of elites and the ability of the governments to alleviate economic hardships on the homefront due to stipends to farmers and wives of servicemen. The Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian, and later German empires fell because they lacked public mobilization and were unable to tend to the hardships of their citizens.In the end the allies won beacuse they were able to out produce the Germans and had better tactics that allowed sustainable advances by the British and French forces. Stevenson concludes his book by stating that the Peace Treaty of Versailles failed not because of harsh penalites, but because the Russians and the Americans were left out of any postwar security arrangements. The main weakness of the book is that it tends to be somewhat dry and academic and probably will not appear to readers of popular history.Another failing of this book is that the author does not fully described the faults of Russian munition makers as written in Jonathan Grant's work about the Puitilov factory.   Otherwise, I would highly reccomend this book to those who are serious students of European and military history.	2004-05-27

In the first section Daniel excuses General Buell for failure to take Chattanooga because the Confederate cavalary destroyed all of his supply depots. However Daniel is very critical of Buell in the Battle of Perryville for not coming to defend his left and for allowing Bragg to invade Kentucky. Daniel is also critcal of Rosecrans for leaving his right flank vulnerabale during the Battle of Stones River and for failing to destroy the Confederate army of Tennessee in the spring of 1863. Finally Rosecrans failed miserabely in overexending his forces during the Battle of Chickamauga which left them vulnerabe for a Confederate attack. Daniel believes that the final general of the Army of the Cumberland, General Thomas, had flaws in that he was too slow like Buell, but gradually improved over time. This is a crtical and very readable history of the Army of the Cumberland, but Daniel leaves out how regimental dynamics such as those mentioned in Gerald Prokopowicz's book impeded the Army's military effectiveness. Overall, I would reccomend this book for anyone who is interested in the Western theater of the Civil War.	2004-05-20

Gaddis believes that the period of American unilateralism lasted until Pearl Harbor but leaves out the fact the United States was a member of mutlitateral alliances during the Boxer Rebellion and the First World War. Also in Gaddis's so called multilateral period during the Cold War, the United States acted unilaterally in its invasions of Grenada and the Dominican Republic. Plus, the American involvement in Vietman was a unilateral affair with minimal assistance from both Asian and European allies. Bush's involvenment in Iraq seems to have more in common with the Vietnam War than any regional actions by the United States during the nineteenth century.	2004-05-11

Porch praises Churchill for defending Greece and North Africa, thereby erasing the stigma of Munich, and allowing British forces to mature in combat. Porch is highly critical of the generalship of Rommel because he overextended his supply lines and lead reckless charges to Tobruk and El Alemein. Moreover Rommel's threat made the United States commit its forces to North Africa. Porch also believes that the bloody Italian campaign was beneficial to the allied cause since it diverted German troops to Greece and Italy that could have been better used in France. Finally the landings in Southern France were needed for the Western Alliance since that region had ports that could support the allied advance on the Western Front. The main weakness of the book is that Porch is a bit too critical of Rommel, who managed to hold the allies at bay for two years, otherwise this is a vastly superior book as compared  to Rick Atkinson's account of the North African campaign.	2004-05-02

According to Strachan, Germany lost the war politically because it did not have any civilian agencies for wartime concerns such as rations and the making of munitions. Due to this weak civic structure, the military took over areas of the government that should have been dealt with by civilian ministries and as a result Germany became ecnomically impaired during the First World War. Germany also failed to use the forces of nationalism to its advantage in Africa and its plan to exploit Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East faltered because it was in direct opposition to Turkish secular nationalism.<BR>     Germany struggled in the war due to the fact that it did not have a common strategy with Turkey and Austria.The Turks and Austrians launched military operations that did not directly benefit Germany's war aims because of this lack of strategic planning. The British, French, and the Americans, however, in 1918 were able to put aside their national differences and launch coordinated attacks on the Germans. The three above mentioned nations were also able to out produce the Germans in the latest technological equippment such as tanks.The only weakness of the book is that Strachan appears to skim over the Eastern Front but for anyone who wants a concise history of the war I would highly reccomend this book.	2004-04-26

In 1900 a large percentage of the officer corps were from the civil war era and had no interest in further intellectual development, but this changed with an introduction of new junior officers who were educated at Fort Leavanworth, Fort Benning, and the Army War College. These schools encouraged personal intiative in officers and the new study of new technologies such as tanks and airplanes. As a result this new class of officers intellectual interest was the development of the Air Corps and armor in the army. <BR>     Coffman also writes about how the army was divided along class and racial lines. The families of officers and enlisted men very rarely intermingled with each other, and officer families only married other officer families and not enlisted men. However some enlisted men such as James Gavin rose to become a general. The army was also divided along race with blacks being gradually eased out of frontline service from 1900 to 1940 and the few black officers such as Benjamin Davis were constantly harassed through their time of duty. This is outstanding book about the American army from 1900-1940 and should be read with the books by Brian Linn.	2004-03-25

The first section of the book, Citino compares the military doctrines of the United States, Germany, Britain, and Russia during the Second World War. Citino believes that German military doctrine was severely flawed since it was mainly adaptable to wars in Western and Central Europe and did not make logicistical provisions for the campaigns in North Africa and Russia. Citino also praises Russian military doctrine for being able to plan for the mass encirclements of the German army in 1943-1945, but criticizes the Russians for lacking personal intiative in combat. Citino also criticizes the British for only attacking with tanks and showing no personal intiative on the battlefield. However Citino praises the American for being flexible and massing their forces on a single point during Operation Cobra.<BR>      The second part of the book, Citino praises the personal freedom allowed officers to conduct battle in the Israeli and Indian armies and writes about the lackluster performance of the Iraqi and Iranian armies that lacked competent officers. In the closing chapters of the book, Citino believes that the victory in Operation Desert Storm was due to superior firepower as well as tactics while Operation Iraqi Freedom was dangerously based on the assumption of internal rebellion and was eventually won by the use of armor. I would reccomend this book for anyone who  believes that technology can replace officership and armor.	2004-02-21

Englund writes that only a small number of French citizens were actually imprisoned during the Napoleonic era and that judicial institutions would sometiemes overturn the government's decisions. Englund believes that Napoleon had a postive role in the countries that he occupied since the basis of strong centralized states were developed in Italy and Germany. However Englund is highy critical of Napoleon's handling of foreign policy since he angered the monarchies of Europe by creating the Republic of Genoa in 1803, and then outraged the Russians by expanding the French satellite of Poland in 1809. Both of these actions, Englund states trapped Napoleon into an unwinnable war. I would strongly reccomend this book to anyone who is interested for a new view of the Napoleonic era.	2004-01-05

Mosier believes that the allies won because they outnumbered the Germans and the Germans held out for years because they had an superior officer corps. Mosier blames Churchill and not the French armed forces for the debacle of 1940. Mosier states in his book that Churchill withdrew the British forces prematurely which left the French northern flank vulnerable. Also Mosier makes the controversial claim that the Germans spent most of their money on fortifications and not enough resources were devoted to tank production while the French had a larger and superior tank force than the Germans in 1940. The Germans won, according to Mosier, because they intergrated close air support operations with the army as opposed to the British and French air forces that concentrated their efforts in strategic bombing. In the closing chapters of the Mosier writes that the reason why the Western allies won  decisively in France in 1944 was because of Hitler's failed counteroffensives in Mortain and the fuitile German attack in the Ardennes in late 1944 sealed Germany's fate although the war would last a few more bloody months. In the concluding chapters Mosier writes that in the end it was superior allied numbers and not skill that defeated the Germans. The main weakness of the book is that Mosier ignores the Eastern Front and the successful blitzkreig operations of General Konev or the American close air support doctrine that was mentioned in Pattons Air Force by David Spires. Overall I would reccomend this book for anyone interested in a new and shocking history of the Second World War.	2003-12-03

Zuber writes that Schlieffen planned to let the French army to across the Rhine and then be surrounded by the German army. Schlieffen made both the right and left flanks strong contrary to popular belief. Moltke attacked the French in 1914 with both flanks equally strong but changed the main direction of the attack to the right flank after the Germans failed to destroy the French forts on the left. This is a highly interesting and controversial book that is highly readable. The main weakness of this book is its expensive price.	2003-10-29

According to Stoler in the early years of World War II the State Department took over the direction of national security due to internal divisions within the JCS. However the JCS managed to defeat the State Department in the laucnhing of Pacific Offensives in late 1942. Thereafter the JCS had greater influence in foreign policy as seen through the aquisition of the mandated islands for military use, against the wishes of the State Department, and plans for the deployment of American troops and bases in Europe to counter the perceived Soviet threat.

Even before the outbreak of the Second World War, American military planners knew that the Philippines were extremely vulnerable to Japanese invasion but were relunctant to raise a native force that could also be a threat to the American Army. The security problems only became worse when before the attack on Pearl Harbor, MacArthur authorized the defence of the entire Philippines and not just the Bataan peninsular. As a result of America's fear of a native force to protect the Philippines and MacArthur's overly ambitious plans, the United State suffered a humiliating defeat to the Japanese in 1942. I would reccomend this book foy anyone who believes that a new American empire would enhance national security but has ignored the disasterous example of the American experience with the Philippines.	2003-09-24

According to Wawro the French had inferior tactics because they would mass their soldiers in defensive formations to take advantage of the superior French rifle over the dispersed German formations but these tactics made the French army unable to counter attack or take personal intiative in combat. The Prussians would take advantage of these French weaknesses by outflanking and eventually surrounding the immobile French formations despite the high causalties that the Prussian army took from the superior French rifles. The Germans also massed their artillery batteries to follow in close formation with the infantry and replied on time to any threats from the French riflemen. As a result the French were pounded mercilessly by the Prussian artillery and could not use their rifles or reply to Moltke's armies. Wawro also blames the inept performance by General Bazaine for the French defeat. Bazaine did not take advantage of the situation at Mars-la-Tour and failed to reinforce his vulnerable right wing at St Privat during the battle of Gravelotte. Wawro believes that Bazaine's  greatest error was leaving his forces at Metz to be surrounded rather than  marching east to German territory and threataning Prussian supply lines or marching north to relieve MacMahon's besieged forces at Sedan.I would strongly reccomend this book for anyone interested in a concise account of the Franco-Prussian War.	2003-09-17

Tsar Nicholas I made the Russian miltitary into a apolitical organization by constant drill and using the secret police to spy on suspicious officers. Officers were driven away from politics in the late nineteenth century by concentrating on military reform and external threats such as Germany and Japan. Taylor believes that the Kornilov coup attempt was exageratted by Kerensky for his own political purposes and that most officers sided with the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War not out of ideology but to mantain order in the army. The Russian officer corps kept this apolitical tradtion alive during the thirties when they failed to respond to Stalin's purges but gave their attention to defense issues and the emerging military threats of Germany and Japan. In the 1990s the Russian military was relunctant to get invovled in domestic affairs and only intervened in 1993 because Yeltsin's foes set up a rival defense ministry that threatened the internal stability of the Russian army. The only weaknesses of Taylor's book is that he fails to mention the main reform intiated by Tsar Nicholas I which subordinated the Russian high command to the war ministry as writen about by Frederick Kagan in his book on the military reforms of Tsar Nicholas I. Nor does Taylor write about the role of the Russian military in the expulsion of Poles, Jews, and Germans in the First World War that historians Eric Lohr and Peter Gatrell stated were done on the army's own intiative and were outside of civilian control. Despite these weaknesses Taylor makes a strong case as to why Russia has not experienced a successful military coup in two hundred years.	2003-08-08

Stolfi believes that the Germans succeded in armor warfare because they had a small staff system that allowed German officers to use their personal intiative in battle as seen though various actions on the Eastern Front where panzer commnaders would take advantage of gaps and weaknesses of the Soviet army. Stolfi also writes that the Germans would use infantry and artillery in combination to repell Soviet attacks and artillery and antiaircraft guns that were tied to the panzer divisions caused massive losses to Soviet tanks and aircraft.

According to Peattie the Japanese dipsersed their carrier groups and that gave them lack of a concentrated punch against the American carriers. The Japanese fighter pilots also had a tendacy to fight independentally but not in groups and this left bombers undefended. The Japanese also did not invest enough money in either reconnaissance aircraft or training their crews which left the Japanese carriers without eyes. Peattie states that the Japanese made errors in the design of their carries since most of the planes were parked in the hangers and not on the take off and landing strip of the carriers like their American counterparts and this made it difficult for Japanese crews to rearm and refuel aircraft. Moreover Japnese carriers had insecure fuel lines that made them flamable when attacked. The planes that the Japanese Navy operated very highly vulnerable to enemey fighters since armor was sacrifice for speed. Finally the Japanese did not train enough pilots to replace their losses during the Pacific War. I reccomend this book to anyone whose interested in why the Japanese lost the Pacific War.	2003-07-03

Hall believes that Sickles flawed position in the Peach Orchard actually helped the Union cause because it slowed the Confederate advance. Hall praises General Warren for moving his forces to the southern end of the battlefield and repelling the Confederate attacks, but Hall states that the famous charge on Little Round Top was not organized by Chamberlain, but rather it was an spontaneous act by the Union soldiers. Hall is very critical of Longstreet in this book and thinks that if Longstreet attacked earlier on the second day of the battle that the Union army coud have been defeated. According to Hall, Longstreet also failed on the third day of the battle  because he did not give enough forces to General Pickett and this allowed the Confederate force to be surrounded by Union forces since it did not have enough flank protection.

Lynn cites the examples of the ancient Chinese and Indian armies as having the same organization of the ancient Greek armies although they were not based on democratic ideals. The Chinese armies were organized around harsh dicipline and personal example by its leaders while the Indian armies were formed around caste allegiances.Moreover the Greek method of warfare was abondoned in Roman times through the emergence of the professsional army. Lynn also believes that there was no set example of &quot;Oriental,&quot; fighting because the Chinese relied upon mass armies while the Indians based their warmaking on subversion and assasination. The middle chapters, Lynn contradicts Hanson in that European armies during the medeval and elightenment periods avoided battle and relied upon seiges. Lynn also describes the development of the Sepoys and how they became an effective fighting force by mixing the European invention of the regiment with local and religious allegiances. In the section about Clausewitz, Lynn states Clausewtiz's ideas about decisive battle and the national will have no use in the age of limited warfare. Lynn also disagrees with John Dower theory about race in the Pacific War by writing that different cultural assumptions about surrender led to the totality of the conflict. In his section about the Egyptian army, Lynn states how the Egyptian army by detailing every last movement by their army during the canal crossing in 1973  compensated for the poor quaility of the junior Egyptian officers.

According to Vincent, Nelson was a compassionate and thoughtful leader at sea, but very immature in his relationships with women. Nelson had a difficult relationships with his first wife Fanny, and Nelson dicarded her in favor of Emma Hamilton who displayed the same childish traits as the Admiral. Vincent belives, that Nelson was never man enough to face Fanny over his infidelity since he constantly ignored Fanny's passionate appeals to rebuild the relationship. Vincent argues that Nelson decisively won the battles of St.Vincent, the Nile, and Trafalgar, but was saved at Copenhagen by the death of Tsar Paul I that led to the Danish government agreeing to British demands. One of the most interesting chapters of the book is Vincent's defense of Neslon's suppression of the rebels in Naples. Vincent states that Nelson was only just following orders from the British and Neopolitain governments and the rebel deaths were miniscule compared to those massacred by the French and their allies. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants a book that describes Nelson's personal life but also includes his battles and the controversory about the Admiral's actions in Naples.	2003-05-28

Hayward praises Admiral Nelson for his humane treatment of subordinate officers and sailors. Hayward also believes that Nelson was innovative in battle because he looked for the waekest section in the enemy's battle line and gave subordinates the freedon to take personal advantage of tactical situations. Nelson, according to Heyward, was considerate to allies such as the Ottomans and the Russians in conducting allied operations in the Mediterranean. But Heyward was strongly critical of the way Nelson handled land warfare in that Nelson was too ready to attack land targets right away rather than respecting the slower seige attacks of the British army. I would reccomned this book who wants an objective book about Nelson's career that doesn't concentrate on the Admiral's personal life.	2003-05-18

Julian supports his point by stating that the British were just as passive as the French in the thirites and the Germans were reluntctant to go to war in 1939, and lacked trucks and ground support planes needed for an modern army. Jackson also compares the French nation's response to the Germans in 1914 with that in 1914, in which the French suffered from similiar poltical problems and had a flawed military strategy, but the French in 1914 were saved by Von Kluck's turn east. Jackson places overall blame on Gamelin's decision to position his forces far north into Holland in order to prevent the Britich from escaping to the sea, but this led to the Ardennes area being poorly manned by third rate divisions. While the French divisions in Holland fought valiantly,the doomed divisons around the Ardennes quickly crumbled. Jackson is also critical about the amount of training received within the French army. The French trained their conscripts for a only a year and that this made the French army loose cohesion and mental flexibality in battle. The only problem with Jackson's arguement is that it was the political divisions in France that prevented the French army from expanding the term of conscription and forming a more effecive army. Despite this flaw, I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in a new and interesting thesis about the fall of France.	2003-05-11

Rossino disagrees with Bartov's thesis that the war crimes committed by the Wehrmacht was due to the stresses of combat on the Eastern Front instead Rossino states that even before they saw significant combat either in Poland or later Russia, the German army executed large numbers of civilians in Poland. Rossino states that the climate of brutality of the German army can be traced backed to the German officer corps taking Clausewitz's people's war theory to an extreme by massacaring the enemey's civilian population as seen in their actions in Southeastern Africa in the late nineteenth century and Belgum during the opening phases of the First World War. Also the ideological indoctrination of German soldiers greatly added to their hositilty to Slavs and Jews.Rossino mentions that oppostiion by some German generals to the activities by the SS and the Wehrmacht in Poland had to due with worries about keeping discipline in the army and not any great concern with innocent civilians. I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in the roots of the Holocaust and the massacre of millions of Slavs by the Wehrmacht during the Second World War.	2003-03-25

Acccording to Habeck both the Germans and the Russians copied the British concpet of independent armored formations to strike the flanks of the enemy army. The Soviet and the German doctrines differed in the role that they gave junior offices. The German doctrines allowed a great deal of intiative to the junior officers while the Soviet doctrine set clear instructions to be followed to the letter by junior officers. Another difference is that the German army believed in the decisive battle while the Russian army thought a series of battles had to be fought in order to achieve victory. The Germans ignored the experience of the Spanish Civil War since the terrain did not favor armored movements. But the Russian opponents to armored warfare used the Spanish Civil War as an example of why armored formations failed in combat.Another reason why the Soviet doctrine appeared to fail was that Russian junior officers could not understand their directions during war games and the Russian army lacked mechanics to fix broken down tanks. As a result Soviet generals favoring armored tactics were purged and the Soviet army returned to an infantry centered force until the results of the German blitzkreig in France made them change their doctrine at the last minute. I would reccomend this book for anyone interested in the development of Russian and German armored doctrine.	2003-03-25

The first part of the book, Sanborn writes about how the Soviet army managed to tighten draft evasions by rewarding those families that had members serving in the military while confiscating the land of draft evaders and their families during the Russian Civil War.Sandborn also deals with the different nationalities in the Russian empire. Belorussians and Ukrainians assimilated into the Russian army but were later segregrated into seperate ethnic units during the Russain Civil War. While Central Asians resisited service in the Russian army and the Jews were regarded by both Tsarist and Communist officers as subversives and dangerous to morale. The middle section Sanborn descibes how gender roles were coonected to the new Russin nationalism. Both Tsarist and Soviet propaganda stated that Russian men must develop their bodies to protect their nation and the family, while Russian women were required to have sons that could drafted into the army. The final section Sanborn writes how the Russian state would redeem criminals and draft evaders if they rejoined the army, but both the Soviet and Tsarist system would harshly punish pacificit sects. Although the state rewarded violent behavior it could not control it as seen through the various atrocities during the Russian Civil War.The main weakness of Sanborn's book is that he does not write about the treatement about the injured soldiers during and after the Russian Civil War and how this influeced their perception of the Soviet state. Overall this an excellent social history of the Russian army and how it contributed the creation of the Soviet Union.	2003-01-23

According to Glantz these attacks stalled the advance of the German armies and prevented Leningrad and Moscow from capture. The second part of the book descibes the failed Soviet counteratttacks to relieve the city. Glantz believes that these attacks failed because they were dispersed and the Russians falied to combined artillery,air, and infantry effectively. The final section of the book details the lifting of the seige of Leningrad and how the Russians managed to operate more effectively by using deception and cordinating with other fronts in conducting offensive operations. However the Russian adavnce was slow because the terrain around Leningrad does not favor the massive tank armies that Russians usually employed on their offensives, but rather they had to rely upon the infantry to achieve a breakthrough. Glantz concludes his book by stating that although the Leningrad Front was a minor front it made the Germans commit ground forces to Leningrad that could have used to capture Moscow and Stalingrad. This is a book is a detailed military history of the battle and I would reccomend this book to military history buffs, but not your average reader since he or she might get bored and confused with the different army groups and fronts. This book emphasizes the military operations and glosses over the civilian suffering during the seige of Leningrad. If one is interested in the civilian view of the seige of Leningrad. I would reccomend \\"The People's War,\\" edited by Robert W.Thurston.	2002-11-25

The first army that Pollack evaluates is the Egyptian army from 1948-1991. Pollack states the main reason for the severe defeat suffered by the Egyptians in 1967 was due to the poor quality of lower ranking officers. These Egyptian lieutenants, majors, and colonels failed to react to Israeli manuevers or look for routes of escape. However Pollack praises the Egyptian high command's decision to move forces closer to the Israeli border because if they waited behind defensive works, the Egyptian army would have been outmaneuvered by the Israelis. When planning for the 1973 war the Egyptian high command planned every detail of the lower officers moves for the upcoming offensive. The end result was that the Egyptian army was suuccesful in the opening phases of the offensive but faced defeat in the unplanned later phases of the conflict.Pollack thinks that the Egyptian high command made the right move in staying in the Northern Sinai and not retreating because the Egyptian army lacked the maneuver skills to implement the later option. The second that Pollack details is the Iraqi army that faced problems similiar to the Egyptian army. In the opening phases of the Iran-Iraq the Iraqi army was outmaneuvered by Iranin forces because of the medicore qaulity of the Iraqi forces. The Iraqi high command compensated for this weakness by carefully planning every operation in minute detail. This soon led to the later Iraqi victories against the Iranians although the Iraqi junior officers still suffered from poor intiative. Because of the above mentioned weaknesses the Iraqi army was swiftly defeated by the United States during the Gulf War, but Pollack states that the Iraqi high command saved the Iraqi army from complete destruction by sacrificing some units of the elite Republican Guard against the American armored forces so that a great percentage of the Iraqi army could escape. The the third army that Pollack details is the Jordainin army from 1948-1991. The Jordanian army was able to defeat the Israelis in the 1948 war because it was officered by British officers thereby escaping the previously mentioned weaknesses of the Iraqi and Egyptian armies. But once the British officers were replaced by Arabs in 1956, this led to the poor showing of Jordanian forces in 1967. The forth army mentioned is the Libyans that had similiar problems with their junior officers and this caused the Libyan defeat in Chad during the late eighties. The Saudi Arabian army which had exactly the same problems as the above mentioned armies was more ineffective since the Saudis never bothered to learn the technical skills to run a mechanized army. The final army that Pollack describes in the book is the Syrian army and how the poor quality of Syrian lower officers led to defeat in it's wars against Israel. The inefffectiveness of the Syrian officer corps allowed the Israelis were able to outflank the Syrians by moving into the Northern Golan Heights during the 1967 war. In planning their moves against the Israelis in the 1973 war, the Syrians copied from Soviet tactics by massing their forces on both flanks of the Israeli army in the Golan Heights but the Syrians restrained the moves of their lower officers to react personally to any Israeli moves. The end result was the near destruction of the Syrian army that was only saved by last minute reinforcements from Iraq and Jordan. During the 1982 war in Lebanon the Syria commandos performed well but the vast majority of the Syrian regular forces performed poorly. I would reccomend this book to anyone interested into the reason why the Arabs lose in war.	2002-10-18

The first army that Pollack analyzes is the Egyptian army from 1948-1991. The low quality of Egyptian lower officers to innovate led to Egyptian defeat during the Six Days War. Pollack praises the Egyptian high command's decision to move closer to the Israeli border prior to the war, because if they stayed behind the original fortifications the Egyptians would have been outmaneuvered. Before the Yom Kippur War the Egyptian high command planned the operation to cross the Suez canal in minute detail since they did not trust their junior officers to display any personal intiative. Once the Egyptian army advance beyond the planned goals the Egyptians were defeated because their lower officers did not know to improvise in combat. Pollack states the Egytian high command made the right decsion in holding the Northern Sinai instead of retreating because if the later option was followed the Egyptian army officers could not have reacted to this fluid situation and the Egyptian army would have faced total defeat.The next army that Pollack evaluates is the Iraqi army with an emphasis on it's war with Iran. In the opening phases of the Iran-Iraq War the Iraqis were constantly out maneuvered by the Iranians because of the low quality of Iraqi offices. To compensate for this low quality, the Iraqi high command developed highly complex plans to be followed to the letter by junior officers. This allow Iraq to gain some victories in the closing stages of the Iran-Iraq War. The Iraqi army was totally unprepared to fight the Americans during the Gulf-War due to the above mentioned problems with it's officer corps. However Pollack believes that the Iraqi high command made the right decision in sacrificing units of the elite Republican Guard against American armored forces so that a large percentage of the Iraqi army could escape from the Coalition forces. The third army is the Jordanian army that was originally officered by British officers in the 1948 war against Israel. Due to the it's British officers the Jordanian army was able to repel Israeli attacks in the 1948 war. However once the army was commandered by Arab officers it faced the same problems as those mentioned in the Iraqi and Egyptian armies and this led to the medicore showing of the Jordanian army during the Six Days War. The Libyan army face similiar problems with it's officers and this led to defeat against the Chadians in the eighites. Pollack states the Saudi Army is perhaps the least effective of the arab armies because the Saudis refuse to learn technical skills to operate hig tech machinery. The final arab country that Pollack evaluates is the Syrian Army. The dismal performance of the Syrian officer corps during the 1967 War, led to a lack of a Syrian response to the Israeli flank attack on the Northern Golan heights. During the 1973 war the Syrians planned a Soviet style attack with forces massed on both Israeli flanks. However unlike the Soviets, the Syrians allowed little freedom for their officers to adapt to the situation. The end result was that the Syrian army came close to collaspse and had to be saved by Iraqi and Jordanian units. During the 1982 war in Lebanon the Syrian army was ineffective except for it's commado units. I would reccomend this book for anyone interested how the poor performance of junior officers can weaken an army.	2002-10-11

Spires writes that Weyland had to deviate from army air corps doctrine which stated that TAC operation had to be centralized rather he allowed his command to be decentralized due to the chaotic nature of the Western Front in the summer of 1944. The XIX TAC proved effective not only in close air support missions but armed reconnaissance and interdiction missions as well. Spires contends that XIX TAC's resources were wasted on bombing stationary military targets in Brest when it would be more effective in attacking movable targets such as tanks in support of Patton's Third Army. During the seige of Metz, Patton allowed Weyland to put most of XIX's resources on interdiction mission and not attacking stationary targets. Spires is slightly critical of Weyland for using too many aircraft as air protection of bases after the Luftwaffe attacked XIX TAC's air fields during the Battle of the Bulge, Spires believes that XIX TAC could have been put more assets in close air support missions and interdiction rather than air defense. After the Battle of the Bulge, XIX TAC's missions became even more decentralized. The army air force liason officer could call the armed reconnaissance TAC squadrons to reccomend air strikes immediately rather the having the missions approved at XIX TAC headquarters. Spires belives that the high casualties that XIX TAC faced had little to do with it's close air support role which were similiar to interdiction missions but rather it was the amount of missions that XIX TAC flew, and the vulnerability of it's small fighter-bombers to flak. I would reccomend this book for anyone interested in close air support operations on the Western Front during World War II.	2002-10-09

The first part of the book deals with the design problems in developing an air craft that could fulfill both the fighter and the bomber roles and how this resulted in failure. Cain then describes how the French air force had a variety of doctrines in the nineteen thirites but ended up being tied to the army. The most intriging aspect of this book is the dilemma that generals in the French airforce had to face in using experienced personnel for trianing or having them placed on the frontlines. This dilemma strangled the French air force in the opening phases of World War II. I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in knowing the reasons why the French air force was so ineffective in the path of the German Luftwaffe.	2002-09-14

The first part of the book Van Creveld describes German air operations in the early phases of the Second World War. The Luftwaffe was extremely effective in interdicting and preventing enemy counterattacks, also Luftwaffe officers and army officers directed the attacks. But Van Creveld argues that the Luftwaffe wasted their resourcers against civilian targets such as railroads. The next air force that Van Creveld analyzes is the Soviet air force. The Soviet air force was under complete control of the army and acted as flying artillery to prevent any German counterattacks from appearing, but the Soviet air force engaged in hardly any interdiction missions against the Germans. According to Van Creveld the Soviets had the most effective form of aerial warfare since their role as flying artillery impeded the Germans from stopping the Soviet attacks. The final air force that Van Creveld evaluates is the Israeli air force. During the Six Day War, the Israeli air force was able to destroy lightly armored trucks but could not due any damage to the Arab tank forces. In the 1973 war the Israeli airforce couldn't provide close air support due to the presence of SAMS. Van Creveld than concludes the book by writing a chapter about the Gulf War  that is strongly crititcal of the USAF. In Van Creveld's opinion if the USAF wasn't addicted to strategic air warfare than it could have closely cooperated with the ground forces in destroying the Iraqi army. In the appendix chapters USAF generals reply to Van Creveld's criticisms by stating that the Allied bombing campaign in Western Europe allowed the Russians to gain air supremacy and have effective close air support operations and the same applied to the IAF's performance in the Six Day War. The only weakness of Van Creveld's book is that he ignores Allied close air support operations in Western Europe from 1944-45, but otherwise this an excellent description of how the Russain and German airforces operated in the Second World War andhow the IAF operates today.	2002-08-13

The beginnning of the book describes some of the crisis facing the French military. Consrcipts were poorly trained since they only had two years worth of training. The same also applied to reservist. The French army was overly strained as to whether to devote resources to the reservists or the conscripts. The schooling that French officers received was limited to their particular branch of the armed forces and lacked any geopolitics or any overview of current military operations. To make matters worse the French army lacked any cohesion. Men in the reserves would be originally in their regional unit than transferred to an new unit based on their technical skills. As a result of this policy men lacked any time to become well adjusted to their unit. The end result of these above mentioned factors was that the French developed a doctrine that was highly centralized and overly cautious. I worked reccomend this book to read alongside James Corum's \\"The Roots of Blitzkrieg,\\" in order to understand the French defeat in 1940.	2002-07-26

American commanders such as Spaatz advocated precision bombing even if it meant greater causalties. Crane writes that civilian causalties became more acceptable when the Army Airforce began bombing transpotation targets in Europe and thereby incuring greater civilian causalties. Plus both Fifteenth and Eighth airforces began using radar directed bombing practices that were less accurate. General LeMay completely ignored the accuracy doctrine and started to delibrately bomb civilian areas. The aim of LeMay's stragedy was to shock the Japanese to surrender. Crane concludes his book by writing about the mediocre record of strategic bombing since the Second World War. Bombing was ineffective against preindustrilized countries such as North Korea and Vietnam, but was effective in shocking Iraq ground soldiers to surrender in the Gulf War. The only weakness of this book is that Crane ignored close air support doctrine within the airforce. But if one wants to study about the American bombing campaigns this is a highly informative study.	2002-07-14

According to Reese the main reason for the defeats that the Red Army suffered during the opening phases of the Second World War was due to the lack of training prior to the German attack. Soldiers spent more time working in factories or collective farms rather than training for war. To make matters worse the huge expansion of the army according to Reese left a huge shortage of junior officers and NCOs to train the new recruits. Stalin only excerbated the situation by abolishing the national guard in order to spend money on the new recruits, this only led to a lack of any reserve units in case of a emergency. Due to the above mentioned factors, Reese concludes that the Red Army suffered massives defeats during the opening phases of the Second World War. I would highly reccomend this book for anyone who wants to understand why the Russian army performed so poorly at the outset of World War II.	2002-07-12

The first part of the book deatils warfare during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the armies had to keep advancing in order in replemish their supplies. If the army stayed in the same area over a large amount of time such as Napoleon's army in Moscow, than the army would run out of supplies. This situation did not change during the Franco-Prussian War in which the Prussian army had to scrounge for food at the outskirts of Paris. All though food remained a problem for the armies there was always a plentiful supply of ammunition since armies of the 18th and 19th centuries expended very little of it. Martin Van Creveld makes some surprising claims in the later part of the book describing twentieth century warfare. Martin Van Creveld believes that the Schlieffen Plan was doomed to failure because of the logistical constraints of the German army. Because most of supplies delivered to the German army were by rail, the desturuction of the railways impeded their advance. Also German planners made no plans to deal with the massive traffic jams in Belgum. The next chapter Van Creveld has an revisionist appraisal of the Germany invasion of Russia in 1941. Van Creveld believes that Germany had the supplies to deal with winter warfare but the inability to transport them across Russia. Due to the difference between German and Russian rail tracks and maintance problems of German engines the supplies never reached the front. Van Creveld strongly criticizes Rommel's handling of the North Africam campaign. Rommel advance to far for his supplies to be replenished. The problem of supply duirng the North African War was that the supplies had to be delivered by trucks that were highly vulnerable to air attack. When Rommel tried to solve the problem by taking Tobruk, he only made matters worse. The ships that arrived at Tobruk were in range of Allied aircraft and as a result sunk. The final Chapter, Van Creveld evaluates Allied operations in Western Europe. Van Creveld believes that Patton's success had to due with the fact that Patton ignored logistic officer's plan for a slow a orderly pace but instead took advantage of the situation to advance quickly. Van Creveld theorizes that Montgomery's narrow front approach could have logistically reached Northwest Germany but were have not captured Berlin. I would highly reccomend this book for anyone who wants a new and interesting perspective about operations during the First and Second World Wars.	2002-07-06

Bradley did not allow enough commandos or air strikes to destroy the German beach obstacles on Normandy Beach. Bradley also ignored General Pete Cortlett's advice that the pre-invasion bombardment should be longer than planned. The invasion was planned in the early morning which made the invasion force easy targets for the German defenders. Bradley refused to plan the landing to place at night because he thought that airpower would neutralize the German defenders. But the aircraft used to disable the German defenses were heavy bombers which were inaccurate rather than smaller tactical aircraft more suited for the task. To make matters worse Bradley placed newly trained soldiers in the first wave while the veterans were in reserve. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in the often overlooked flaws of commanders such as Omar Bradley.	2002-07-03

The first part of the is about how the IDF was improvised in the early phases of the First Arabi-Israeli War. According to Van Creveld those who originated from the PALAMCH companies were much more effective in combat compared to their British trained compatriots within the Israeli army. In the middle section Van Creveld criticizes is the IDF's performance in the Suez Canal campaign and the Six Day War. Van Creveld credits the airforces of the British and French in making the Israeli's campaign successful, but the Israelis committed numerous mistakes such the as the paratroop landing at Mitla Pass that was a militarily useless objective. The next chapter Van Creveld questions the IDFs effectiveness during the Six Day War. Van Crevled theorizes that contrary to public opinion the IDF did not practice the much vaunted indircet approach. The IDF mainly attacked the northern and central Egyptian forces in the Sinai. This allowed those Egyptians in the southern sector to escape. The only general to practice the indirect approach was Yoffe, but since Yoffe was an reservist he never received the publicity and the credit that was due to him. The IDF also never made use of combined arms except in the case of Sharon's operations in the Sinai. Van Creveld harshly condems Israeli operations in the opening phases of the Yom Kippur War of 1973. The overcentralized yet disoganized command structure of the IDF led to near disasterous defeats in the early phases of the Yom Kippur War. Van Creveld then evaluates the IDF's performance in Lebanon during the early nineteen eighties. The IDF tried to put too many armored vehicles in a country that had a scarcity of roads. As a result the IDF became bogged down in traffic jams and the PLO was allowed to escape. The IDF proved itself to be incapable of dealing with insurgencys as to seen in their response to the Palestinian uprisings of the lateeighties. The IDF would send it's most ill trained sildiers to deal with the uprising. As a result the IDF either used excessive force or prudence, both of which led to defeat. Van Creveld states the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is slowly stagnating the IDF and that the Israelis must pull back from these territories.<br /> Another aspect that is mentioned in the book is the situation of manpower within the IDF. In the first phase of it's history the IDF was a compact, highly trained, and motivated fighting force. But in the seventies and eighties the force became bloated and ineffective. The IDF accepted so many conscripts that all but the elite units were trained effectively.Van Crevled opionizes that the conscription of women has only made the problem worse. Van Creveld tells about how ill educated IDF officers are compared to their foreign counterparts. Unlike most Western nations the IDF has no formal service academy. Instead IDF officers had to prove their leadership ability while as an NCO and then go to officer training school. The attempt to introduce a defense university has only met with failure in Israeli history. In the eighties and nineties a vast majority of educated Israelis opted out of the IDF officer corps. But very ill educated but religious Israelis became a large percentage of the current Israeli officer corps. Van Creveld believes that these new religious officers pose a great threat to Israelis democracy. The only criticisms that I have with the book is that Van Creveld glosses over Israeli operations in the Golan Heights during the 1967 and 1973 wars. Other than these minor criticisms this is by far the best book about the history of the IDF.	2002-06-28

The first part of the books descrbes the small wars before the outbreak of the First World War. The absence of artillery support made tasks made the infantry's task extremely difficult in the the Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War. Another factor that impeded success was the lack of communications so that the Russian army was able to escape repeatedly from the Japanese pincers. Dr. Citino also analyzes the little known Balkan Wars of 1912-13... This is by far the best book about military thought of the early twentieth century,but Citino could have written more about the Russian and American military thought during this time period. Nevertheless I would highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in military thought and practices.	2002-06-21

While Ambrose praises the technoncratic approach of the airmen during World War II, Sherry harshly condemns this culture. According to Sherry this made the airmen unable to formulate alternatives to strategic bombing of cities instead they measured success in the amount of damage that the bombers caused regardless of the target's military value.Ambrose does not mention the bombing Dresden in his account. Nor does Ambrose write about the disasterous raids made by the Fifteenth and Eighth airforces in 1943 when hundreds of aircrew lost their lives for targets of dubious military value. Instead we get a myopic account of George McGovern's time in the Army Air Force.	2002-06-18

According to the author, the British navy put more of a emphasis on character and less on intellect in the devolopment of it's officer corps. This led to all the most intellectual officers being ignored but the one that obeyed the rules were promoted to the highest ranks. Because of the above metioned factors the British navy faced near disaster at Jutland. One can see the tragic consequences when character dominates intellect in an institution.	2002-06-16

In the opening chapter Cohen writes how Linclon would use Charles Dana to spy and presure Grant into taking action. Cohen praises Clemenceau for preventing Foch from marching on to Berlin after the First World War. According to Cohen, Foch's proposed march would have led to disaster since the already exhausted French army would be doomed to defeat. The next chapter, Cohen empahsizes Churchill's constant vigilance on the actions of his generals during the Second World War. But Cohen glosses over Churchill's decisions to withhold support from British actions in North Africa in order to help relieve first the Greeks and then the doomed defenders of Singapore in 1941. Cohen also ignores Churchill's opposition to the landings in Southern France whose ports were large enough to support the Allied forces in Western Europe. Cohen never mentions Churchill's role in the disasterous landings at Anzio or Churchill wanting to make the fruitless Italian campiagn the main theater of war. The final leader that Cohen evaluates is David Ben-Gurion. Cohen lavishes praise on Ben-Gurion for not taking all of Jerusalem after the First Arab-Israeli war becuase of diplomatic and political reasons. In describing the Vietnam War, Cohen never mentions civlian advisers such as W.W. Rostow who advocated extremely flawed military strategies for fighting the war. In the concluding chapters, Cohen criticizes Powell for exhibiting the kind of restraint after the Gulf War that was displayed by Clemenceau and Ben-Gurion in the previous sections. The book's strongest sections are about Linclon,Clemeanceau, and Ben-Gurion but the sections on Churchill and the Vietnam and Gulf Wars are very compromised by the author's ideology. Cohen's understanding of the Vietnam and Gulf wars appears to be tainted by his personal politics. The same could be said about Cohen's evaluation of Churchill. Apparantally Cohen's neo-conservative ideology is undermining his own logic.	2002-06-11
