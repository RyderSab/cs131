The basic setup of the book is quite helpful and informative.  Morton begins each section with a lengthy commentary on the readings that will follow; these typically involve a discussion of the historical background of a particular philosophy, key terms, and a detailed discussion of the excerpt or essay contained in the section.  The book includes a glossary but suffers from a lack of an index; the process of locating a term mentioned in an introduction, for example, tends to be quite complicated.  The text &quot;begins at the beginning&quot; with Plato, Aristotle, Galileo, and a great deal of information and readings about and by Descartes.  The actual philosophies it covers are:  dualism, monism (materialism and idealism), logical behaviorism, linguistic philosophy, mind-brain identity theory, artificial intelligence, functionalism, and eliminative materialism.  Each of these typically has 2-3 thinkers represented in terms of essays and excerpts, and the sections vary from about 20 to 40 pages apiece.  Morton almost always provides a large and well-excerpted chunk of reading, which, coupled with the detail he provides in his commentary, will help in making a person able to discuss and understand the positions detailed here.  The book concludes with a lengthy section on consciousness (featuring Nagel's famous essay &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot; plus three other readings) and a somewhat confusing section on Intentionality (perhaps the most confusing section of the book).  Morton's commentary, overall, is clear and helpful; the philosophies covered here are quite complex, but his writing and careful choosing of reading material makes them easier to grasp.	2001-05-01

This woman's life was certainly fascinating in its own right, and Haight makes it all  the more interesting because of her clear presentation, good organization,  and obvious connection with her subject.  The poet's life is covered from  her birth to her death in the 1960s; in her long life, she saw the  revolution, suffered great personal tragedy (often the product of the  Stalinist regime), but kept writing through it all.  This biography would  be interesting to a person who had no prior knowledge of Akhmatova or a  person who is familiar with her poetry and wants to know more about the  writer.  I have always found that Akhmatova and Wordsworth are the two  poets I have the most trouble separating from the speakers of their poetry,  and this biography is thus a very interesting companion to Akhmatova's  work.  Haight's writing and research are difficult to find fault with.  I  also recommend THE COMPLETE POEMS OF ANNA AKHMATOVA, edited by Roberta  Reeder.	2000-06-03
US	52461817	R26N1ASLKK6SW1	0415144868	333064651	Philosophy of Literature: An Introduction	Books	2	4	9	N	N	keep looking	This book raises some interesting questions, but New's method of answering them is throughly obnoxious.  He presents other theories in brief and proceeds to shoot them down without giving a reader ample chance (or information) to contemplate any theory but his own.  Also, there are  mistakes in describing certain theories.  The chapters are:  What is  literature? clearing the ground;  What is literature?  Definitions and  resemblances; Fiction; Psychological reactions to fiction; Imagination;  Metaphor; Interpretation and Intention; Literature, truth, and morality;  and Literary appraisals.  The book is theory-oriented, and if literary  theory is what you're interested in, look elsewhere.  New's book is  inadequate both in the areas of explanation (of any theories except his  own; incidentally, his prose is not good at all) and argument (as there is  never adequate chance to explore other theories, which are described poorly  and sometimes incorrectly).  If you want to learn about literary theory,  keep looking.	2000-04-25

Russian Thinkers is a collection of essays on Russian luminaries, including  Alexander Herzen, Belinsky, Tolstoy, Bakunin, and the populists (including  Chernyshevsky).  It would be helpful to have background knowledge about  Russian history in this time period (mainly 19th century) before reading  the book, but it is also intersting as a philosophical text, and Berlin  expertly outlines the thought of these major figures.  The main obstacle to  reading this work may be Berlin's writing style, which is initially  somewhat clunky (strangely, I found this to be the case mainly in his  famous essay \\"The Hedgehog and the Fox\\"), but it does flow better  once one gets used to it.  Like all philosophical texts, though, what at  first seems abstruse often proves rewarding and enriching.  This book would  be of interest to those who enjoy history or philosophy.  (note:  if you  like this text, Personal Impressions is also worth a look)	2000-03-26

For those not familiar with the work, this is an excellent  historical novel dealing with the Scottish rebellion of 1745.  The events  depicted are real, though most of the characters are not.  It has the  \\"classic\\" elements of a novel:  love, war, suspense, etc.  It's  also an interesting depicition of the many layers of society on one small  island.  Good for history buffs, literature fans, or people just looking  for a good novel!	2000-03-26

Being a tremendous fan of Jack Kerouac, I really just wanted to read Baby Driver out of curiosity. I was pleasantly  surprised to find out that the family literary gene successfully made its  way to Jan Kerouac.  This book is excellent; her writing style is fluid and  highly commendable.  It's not hard reading, but that isn't to say that  there isn't plenty here to ponder.  I would certainly recommend this book  to anyone, and not just those who are interested in Kerouac Sr.  For women  especially, this book is well-worth reading.	2000-02-10

In some places, it is literally a page-turner.  It's not as analytical as some historical texts, but Lincoln provides more  than enough information to allow the reader to make his/her own decisions.   Every detail is perfectly groomed for presentation, and few stones are left  unturned.  This book is accessible (ie, those with little background in  Russian history will find it intriguing and highly readable) and  informative.  The only complaint I have is that, occassionaly, it jumps  around in time in peculiar ways (but this is not something that really  causes one to get lost or confused).	1999-12-06

I want to commend Borroff's translation in particular; she  reproduces the alliterative meter and verse structure superbly, adding much  to the reading.  This work is captivating and entrancing; I highly  recommend it.	1999-09-30

Unlike many translations, this one is not at all stiff and formal; on the contrary, it flows, much like the opera itself.  The Dover edition  is a particulary nice size and weight, making it convenient to carry to the  opera or to read while listening to a recording of it.	1999-04-26

Her short stories reveal surprising depth, and her \\"Constant  Reader\\" reviews (especially the AA Milne ones!) are a real riot.  I've  found that it's an excellent bedside companion.    No subject is sacred when it comes to being a target of Parker's poetic wit. Her gems are enjoyable, and you'll find yourself quoting them at every opportunity.  Her short stories reveal a different side of her-- a more meditative, melancholy mood.  Together, in the anthology, they harmonzie and balance each other perfectly.  Recommended.	1999-03-31

I practically wore my library card through checking out this book (until I finally got my own  copy!).

Clearly, The  Pink Motel stretches across generations, and it's not easily forgotton.	1999-03-29

Her wit is dry, her prose is brief and highly readable, and it is, in general, a very accessible book.  It's good for bedtime  reading, when you don't really want to concentrate too hard, or for a  &quot;pick-up, put-down&quot; book.  It's enjoyable and really worth  reading-- try it!

This would have to be my least favorite of the &quot;trilogy,&quot; but it's still worth reading.  It's amusing and contains several extremely funny  scenes.  This is a great book for anyone who like humor, offbeat characters  (to say the least), and a plot with some really strange twists.	1999-01-27

Kerouac's book is fascinating; it's  thought-provoking and beautiful.  The scenes atop Desolation Peak are  enough to seize the reader with a desire to go out, to leave whatever is  holding him or her back, and to experience nature and oneself in a new way.	1999-01-27

US	52461817	R2P1YD0T2ASBLC	0684833395	458864358	Catch-22	Books	5	0	0	N	N	excellent	This book is a lot deeper than it may seem if one gives it only a casual brush.  It concentrates on the evils of war (its absurdity) by creating a text with little concrete plot, shifting time, and characters who are as  senseless as war itself.  Heller makes his point very clearly, and this  novel deserves to be regarded as a classic. Comparisons with  Slaughterhouse-Five are almost certain to arise; Vonnegut's novel is the  stronger of the two, but Heller should not be underestimated in any way.   The message of this novel, which is developed slowly as Heller leads the  leader up to a spilling secret, is plain; for a lover of peace and wry  humor, this is an excellent piece to read.  For a lover of war and  conflict, however, this is a novel that should certainly be read; if  everyone could be lead to see Heller's point of view, maybe the world would  be a safer, better place for \\"nuts\\" like Yossarian.	1998-12-21

Yes, it's not anything you're going to learn in American government.  But yes, it's worth reading. While some conclusions that the author draws may be a little far-fetched,  some of the ideas presented (especially those regarding the CFR and the  Trilateral Comission) are more than worth consideration.  The book does an  excellent job of showing that there is more to politics than American  Government 101; it's good for expanding one's horizons.  Many of the ideas  really are credible, even if they do seem a little off-beat at first. All  in all, this one is well worth a read.	1998-12-10

The first time I read it, I was overwhelmed by Mann's skill as a writer and how beautifully-crafted the novel is.  It was so good, I didn't even want to return it to the library!   The symbolism was amazing; I was still noticing things as I reviewed the  novel in my head weeks later.  &quot;I am much indebted to you for the  elucidation&quot; is a great line (one among many!).

This book isn't meant to be used by itself; it's more like a reference text than anything  else.  Occassionaly, Viault neglects certain topics, and some are given  more coverage than appropriate for a small text while others don't get  enough.  All in all, though, this is a handy book to have around.	1998-10-28

Harrap's includes clearly  visible entries, which is helpful when one is flipping to find a word  quickly, is a good size, and contains enough modern words to be a help in  reading more recent texts and articles.

The book is informative and very  well-written; it does not \\"dumb down\\" history in any way, and it  presents a coherent, philosophical approach to a complex subject.  The  book's organization is very good, and it even reads like a particulary  interesting novel at some points.  I have found myself going back to it  again and again to check up on details; I have recently used it in my  university French and political science courses.  The text embraces a wide  variety of topics in history and never ceases to give a fascinating  approach to modern European history.	1998-10-26

The trust that Covington describes is  incomprehensible and wonderful; the absolute, unswerving faith in the midst  of what is a very real, very evil world is amazing.  Covington does an  excellent job of presenting a portrait of something that has survived  against the odds; what he describes is a world that some may have  difficulty believing exists.  The book is gripping and moving.  It may be a  challenge for a \\"modern\\" reader to fully understand this faith,  but this novel is certainly an example of how anyone, even a seasoned  reporter, can be moved by an old gas station, some rousing music, and a box  of snakes.	1998-10-22

While  the text in itself is quite interesting, the photos are perhaps the most  gripping aspect of the book.  To see the tiny, crowded rooms populated by  unreal numbers of people and the eyes of hungry children that stare out of  the picture and are still imploring a century later is a powerful  experience; Riis's book allows one to get very close to the misery these  people felt.  This book is not for the soft-hearted, as it is a very grim  depection of life, such as it was for these immigrants.	1998-10-12
