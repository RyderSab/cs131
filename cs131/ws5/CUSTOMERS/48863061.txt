Clearly Mr. Frei did a thorough job researching all the events and the many characters he references.  As for the reader, he/she is taken on a journey about teenagers turning into young men during one of the most difficult times in American history.  Frei goes into great detail about the Wisconsin Badger roster and characters that make it up.  At times, it does get confusing but I honestly don't see how Frei could have singled anyone out -- except for perhaps Dave Schreiner.  I will admit I skipped some of the middle of book when the author gives a recap of all the Badger games from 1942.  The second half of the book (about the war) is very well done.  In fact, the second half of the book is a real page tuner.  All in all, it is a good book about some fine people that I would have loved to have met.	2005-09-30

Full of annedotes and commentary.  No subject is off limits.  I must admit, if you are from Texas (which I am not) you will surely get more laughs then a Yankee.  Kinky takes the reader on a variety of rides through his mind, refusing to stop even when the trails become muddy.  The book is so good, you will have to reread it just to make sure you got all it.  Texas Hold em' is easy to read -- whether on a horse or on a train or sitting in a recliner.  Nothing complicated, just a bunch of a essays that make the book very difficult to put down.  I hope this isn't the last we've heard from the Kinkster.	2005-09-23

'Scuse Me While I Whip This Out' seemed like a good place to start.  The book is a quick and easy read full of annedotes and lots of stories that only those bold enough can put into print.  I enjoyed his very dry humor and wit.  The chapter on Joseph Heller was particularly noteworthy since very few have been able to pin down this literary legend.  If you looking for something different and are open enough to read another point of view, then I strongly recommend this book.  The creativity that Kinky Friedman provides is worth the price of the book.  A strong 4 stars.  Now I am about to that on his latest book.	2005-09-14

There are not many characters so it's easy to follow.  The plot is simple -- a golfer at the end of his career is trying to win a major championship.  The reader is taken through the twists and turns as each major unfolds.  I found myself laughing out loud several times.  If you want a book to read at the beach or in the bathroom -- this is your book.  Nothing comprehensive about Slim and None.  I must say -- the ending stinks!!!!  I really thought Dan Jenkins could have put more time into it as the book abruptly ends.  I might give Dead Solid Perfect a try because I've gotta believe Mr. Jenkins has more to offer than this.  His columns in Golf Digest are priceless.  Save your money or buy a used copy -- it's not worth $20.	2005-06-03

Dean takes the reader on a journey through countless miles but somehow the \\"marathons\\" stop short.  In all honesty, I have survived 186 pages of this extra ordinary mans expose'.  What I have been left with is an egotistical, self-serving man on a quest for God knows what.  It's one race after another.  Never does he tell about his recovery period or a summary of the physical abuse he puts himself through.  Dean is rare and God knows he doesn't lack confidence or an ego.

Phil not only takes the reader through his final 18 holes at Augusta but also the foundation that he was provided as a child.  The book is very easy and a quick read.  Surrounded by supportive family and friends, Phil makes it a point not to take any of that for granted.  Unlike so many professional athletes, Phil is grounded and humble.  It is impossible not to cheer for Phil Mickelson.  Of course, I am terribly biased as I am a huge Phil Mickelson fan.  I am a die-hard sports fan and am seldom moved by accomplishments.  However, I must say I wore out my family room carpet as he played the back 9 on Sunday at Augusta.  Enjoy the book golf fans because I know I did.	2005-03-24

What we have here is a young man looking for direction in his life.  He finds it in an expected place, a job with the IRS.  As a Revenue Officer (tax collector), Yancey discovers success and personal growth.  The stories and his personal development is an interesting transformation.  The book is very easy to read and enjoyable.  The characters in the book are outstanding.  Anyone who thrives in the bureaucratic world can certainly relate to all of them.  Very good book, not a masterpiece but more than enough to keep you turning the pages.	2005-03-22

What the reader finds in The Christmas Blessing is an easy to read page-turner with great characters.  The story line is simple (but not insulting) and easy to follow.

In reality the lovely words found in the The Christmas Shoes drove me to tears (lots of tears).  The character development makes this book easy to read.  The two story lines are simple to follow.  The Christmas Shoes is a real page turner.  The epilogue in this book is the best epilogue I've ever read.

After reading Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom, I found myself wanting more of the same type of novel and with that I stumbled upon My Twice-Lived Life.  Being in my mid-40's, my mind set has started to wander about what lies ahead.  Mr. Murray has done a tremendous job capturing not only his life but thought process.  It's very easy to read, as the sub title chapter are carefully arranged. His sense of humor is comforting as he puts everything into proper prospective.  Anyone looking for answers about aging should read this masterpiece.  I loved every page and know I'll reread this treasured novel again and again.  I can't wait to give it to my mother-in-law to read.	2004-01-02

This book was slightly above average.  Its easy to read but I'll be honest, it just didn't provide me with the insight that I was looking for. The Stone Cold Truth is an autobiography that goes into detail of the many decent people in the wrestling business that Steve Williams has encountered.  His failed marriages are a result of the profession that he has chosen and the man that he is -- neither are wrong.  I read the book, I liked it. But I didn't love it and I wouldn't read it again because there is just nothing special about it.  If you love Stone Cold Steve Austin -- this is the book for you.  If you want real insight into wrestling entertainment seek elsewhere.	2003-12-08

Perhaps being in my mid 40's led me so undiscover some of my deepest feelings.  After reading The Five People You Meet In Heaven, I stumbled onto the literary works of Richard Paul Evans.  Let me cut the chase.  I read this book in one day.  I can't explain why I couldn't put it down.  Mr. Evans does an outstanding job of character development.  Most fiction books one tends to get lost in too many characters, A Perfect Day is very easy to read.  The book is about his writing of A Perfect Day.  Superb execution of the thought process and quite easy to relate to if one is put in that position.  I'll admit the ending is somewhat disappointing.  Quite frankly, I thought Mr. Evans could have expanded on it a bit more.  But this book still deserves an unprecedented 5 Stars because its story fulfilled me in every sense.  A Perfect Day is a love story, a mystery, imaginative and passion all confined into 288 pages.  A Perfect Day is reading A Perfect Day.	2003-11-29

Mitch Albom has done it again.  &quot;Five People....&quot; is a beautiful fable that is easy to read with its messages very easy to comprehend.  Mitch's character development captures the reader in a way no other writer can.  He is masterful at describing the clouds and color and the true meaning of both.  Bottom Line -- Read The Book.  I finished it in one afternoon.  If you are looking for a book that gives one mans version of the after-life than this is your book.  I've got to tell you -- Mitch Albom has become my favorite author!!!!!!!  And for those of you who haven't read Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom -- SHAME ON YOU.	2003-10-16

I only read this because I enjoyed Mr. Reilly's recent works -- Who's Your Caddy?  Missing Links is an entertaining novel about six golfing buddies, all with distinct personalities.  The character development done by Mr. Reilly is nothing short of spectacular.  There are enough twists and turns in the book to keep the reader turning the pages.  At the same time, there aren't so many characters that you're wondering who is who.  It's a shame the book had to end, rather abruptly I might add.  You don't have to like golf to enjoy this book.

Who's Your Caddy gives you that and so much more.  This book takes the reader on a pleasant journey through the personalities of such greats as Jack Nickalas and Tommy Armour and provides a candid look at other well knowns like David Duvall, John Daly, Casey Martin and Tom Lehman.  Perhaps the most intriguing chapters are those of the Blind Golfer, Jill McGill and Donald Trump.

This is a great book if you know someone who is obssessed with the game of golf.  Its very easy to read.  The sample test in the back of the book to see if you should be committed is hysterical, the glossary and world records will leave the reader in stitches because only those searching for the &quot;secret&quot; will understand.

I'm a casual wrestling fan having watched it on and off for the last thirty years.  \\"In the Pit\\" is a VERY easy read with  insight in the world of wrestling but mostly its about him.  I have a great deal of respect for Rowdy Piper because its clear he didn't compromise his integrity!!!!  His story goes into great detail about the extensive good times, the bond between fellow athletes and quick  behind the scenes look (i.e. lack of health benefits and how controlling the promoters are) -- which I wish he would have expanding on.  Yet the story is very compelling and revealing, as his stories are positively hysterical.  The book is entertaining but it does to jump around a bit.  It is indeed written in true in Rowdy fashion, its as if he and I were sitting in bar and him recounting his roller coaster life.  After I put I down, I was left with two thoughts -- 1) God Bless His Wife Kitty and 2) I hope he writes another book soon.	2002-12-09

Being a golf addict, I was hoping this book could keep my interest.  Final Rounds is a very easy read and the characters are clearly defined.  Regretfully, Mr. Bernhardt resorted to old cliches with very little originality.  The concept of the book is great.  The lead character, Mr. Cross is predictable and its a real shame especially with his personality (big shot golfer, lots of talent, ladies man and etc.).  The ending is totally unpredictable and had nothing to really do with the story.  It's almost as if the last 60 pages were quickly written to end the nightmare.  I really expected so much more and was very disappointed.  The fact that I finished the more is more of an accomplishment than this literary work.  Better luck next time!	2002-07-01

The Dewsweepers takes the reader to far greater places than the golf course (freudian slip).  Instead, it is a journey into life's unexpected twists and turns -- yet always returning to peace and tranquil feeling that only golf provides.  It reminds all -- that Friendship is more important than breaking 80.  Like Final Rounds, The Dewsweepers is eloquently written.  The diversity of characters can be a bit confusing but all in all it is a very good read.  I'd really rate this 4 1/2 Stars, falling just short of Final Rounds.	2001-11-19
