I even had the book signed, the things you do sometimes...<br />It is a truly beautiful book.  If not great litterature, it is certainly a well written memoir that reads like a novel.  But it is not fiction.  One sees the progressive changes in the mood of the Doctor as his sense of duty slowly but surely affect his work and his family life.<br />But most important of all, if this book does not cure you from AIDS prejudice, nothing will.	2003-12-07

I bought it in Atlanta's airport because it seemed short and substantive, while entertaining.  Perfect companion for a long trip, apparently.  Well, its 120 pages with pictures seemed actually rather too long.  I thought that Mr. Obregon was really going to take us in some of the motivations for seafaring and exploration over the ages, mystical or not.  Instead, it was mostly a rather odd account of his work and his thoughts on the mythic Greek travels.  Yes, I did learn a few interesting things, but most of the perspectives offered are already well known.  What bothered me more is that I was also able to catch a few glaring geographical mistakes which made me wonder about the editor.  But perhaps the answer came from what I read on the back cover: Mr. Obregon died in 1998 and the copyright is in 2001.<br />At any rate, I will not discourage people from getting it, it is cheap and still entertaining for a long flight.  And you will be unburdened on your return flight as you can give the book to your hosts as a thank you present.	2003-08-31

Any more serious reading, for the meaning searcher, will stumble unto the unlikely premise of a few gay developers that end up transforming within a year a restful and forgotten Rhode Island resort.  Yeah, forgotten, sure.....  The characters described tend to be a little bit stereotyped, and the plot turns way too much around real estate, including the aging queen buying a little palace with private harbor.  The coming out/coming of age subplot starts well, but ends up predictable of course.  More interesting is the old antique dealer closeted queen transformation, which by itself and with more development could be the seed of a nice book.  But as I said before, if what you have in mind is a book to take to the beach, or to the country home of your friends upstate, for the week end, then you might get a few smiles out of it.	2002-09-22

Since I read it I have not checked the place out but found some people that actually corroborated part of the story.  This is why I reluctantly give it 5 stars.  In spite of a certain inconsistency through the book, a few misplaced left leanings comment, a hard to believe naivete, the books stands firm as a good representation of Venezuelan rural mores, and a heartfelt memoir.  Now, I do not want this to mean that Lisa Saint Aubin de Teran is an accurate reporter.  She tries her best and only God knows how difficult it is to understand Venezuelan society.  However she is very successful at conveying the spirit that moves things there, for good or bad.  She is at her best when she shows how in spite of every hardship that falls on her, the country slowly gets into her and she cannot help but love it.  I can relate with that, she is not making it up.  And last but not least, in light of recent political turmoil in Venezuela, I can recommend this book highly: it will explain why a phenomenon like Chaves came upon Venezuela better than any long political analysis you might find around.  Although Ms Saint Aubin kept her patrician acquired Teran she was unto something when she describes the \\"absentee landlord\\" mores of Venezuelan old elite families.  Her comments on them are rather damming.  But the reader needs not to worry, this is still a very strong personal memoir, that can also serve as a political memento.	2002-09-08

His tale is a little bit more down to earth as he undertakes to make sure that the reader understands first a few parameters on how cultures grow and meet their demise.  Eventually when you read the sections that actually try to explain how the Maya fell, you sort of guess stuff before he tells you.  Probably this comes from a Socratic style of teaching from Professor Webster.  It also does not help that he can be tongue in cheek sometimes, and deliberately challenging when he confess that he cannot read Mayan glyphs.  Is he serious?  After a while this has a salutatory effect: the reader realizes that there is no magical mystery to the Maya: they were just like any other civilization, just a little bit odd.  They were humans first and that explains very well why they became great and why they also harbored the seeds of their decline.  The only mystery here is the mystery of human genius that made this people build such exquisite ensembles as Tikal, or the author's favorite Copan.  Definitely a clear book on what are the current thoughts on Maya history based on recent archaeology, a non sentimental look on the Maya, and the best exposition so far to demonstrate that the Maya demise was not as sudden as people would like to think.  Also a very salutary reminder that today natives are the descendents of these fabled rulers and that if they stopped building pyramids it was not because they became stupid and degenerated.  The truth might be that they just saw the light and kicked the ruling class out when they realized that they had become a burden they could not afford anymore.  Clearly, in spite of serious political and ecological problems, the Maya that \\"greeted\\" Cortez were the heirs of the ancient Maya.	2002-09-08

Some are quite amusing such as his self-tests on how to decide whether one should become a drag queen or a leatherman (in a way both are drag I suppose).  It is perfect reading for a beach stay, or waiting at your dentist office and having people look weirdly at you while you hold the book in front.  But it still feels the same as the previous ones: well written, slightly biting, but not that novel anymore.  Though this time there is a slight change: Mr. Ford has moved to LA and he seems to comply more with your average gay-cliches: he works out now and wears sunglasses.  Perhaps his early steps in his middle age crisis?  In other words, under his cleansing tone we seem to detect a more personal, and perhaps insecure, persona.  I hope that this bodes well for his next installment since I think that Mr. Ford is uniquely qualified to describe the aging process of gay men by lightening it up with his irony.	2002-02-03

Nice pictures, easy text, not too deep.  A good reference if you want to choose which Maya big spots you want to visit in your next vacation.  It does suffer from not reflecting more recent advances on the interpretation on Maya history, such as the Toltec influence.  But it is not apparently the objective of the book.  This reviewer thinks that what the author wants is for you to get interested in the Maya civilization, to respond to the beauty and greatness of its art, to give to research and protection funds...  All very commendable goals but perhaps a little too weak for the more historically minded.  Yet, even this last one can have a fine time reviewing this book which is always a nice reminder of the places we saw, or want to visit someday.	2001-11-11

Loaded with facts and interpretations but not overloaded.  It reads really nicely, and furthermore, it can be read by sections if one wishes so, though it would be a pity.  Some minor editing problems (e.g. some numbers seem unbelievable and are likely typos).  Enough illustrations to rest the eyes of the reader, and adequate maps.  But for this reviewer the best feature of this book is that the author tries to integrate the history of successive cultures of Mesoamerica.  For example, if you want to know what happened to the post classic Mayas you will need to go to another chapter than the main one on Mayas.  This way the mutual influences of cultures can be better understood, at least when those influences did take place.  Very likely the best all around book on Mesoamerica that one could have on the bookshelves.  My only grip is the title, slightly misleading since it suggests prehistory.  If history is defined as from the time when a cultures can write its history, then what about the Mayas who had a complete writing system?  Not very \\"politically correct\\" if you ask this reviewer.	2001-11-11

The structure of the book relies on interpreting some main architectural achievements of the Mayan kings who commissioned them.  That is, for most chapters a brief historical narrative is followed by a detailed description of the monumental group of interest and ends with an interpretation as to its relevance.  The interpretations are good, and we can appreciate the great scholarly gifts of Linda Schele (in particular when the authors dispose of the Toltec Maya myths of Chichen Itza).  We can even be moved at times such as when the authors talk of the Great Plaza of Waxaklahun-Ubah-K'Awil (this reviewer was happy to have read it a few days before going to Copan).  However, this dense package might scare away a more casual reader of the Maya history.  It also makes this book pretty useless to take along in your trip to Guatemala and Yucatan, unless you will have plenty of time to sit down under some trees and read while you visit.  But if you have plenty of time to prepare for your trip, you definitely need to read it.  And of course, it is a must in any serious book collection on the Maya.	2001-11-11

The research on the ancient Maya culture over the last decades has revealed enough information that a more or less complete sequence of events can be drawn over several centuries.  It also has revealed that the Mayan did not seem able, or willing, to strive towards the establishment of a centralized empire as others civilizations tried.  The result is a complex story involving the struggles between loosely organized groups of petty states around a few major ones.  Telling that tale in an exciting way is thus more difficult: no Alexander the Great figure here to follow....  But Martin and Grube have been able to spin the yard of quite a tale.  Once you pass the catchy title that makes you wonder whether the inside will be lightweight history, you do realize that this is a very complete, if brief, book.  After a concise introductory chapter, the authors chose deliberately to tell the story of a few individual cities.  You might disagree as to why they chose those (Northern cities such as Uxmal are absent).  You might have wanted a more unified tale of Mayan civilization.  Or perhaps a more people's oriented history.  But the fact is that there are not many facts on the ancient Maya in spite of recent advances.  It is to the merit of the authors to make the most of these facts to write an informative story, a city based history as the Mayan were, without entering into undue speculations.  And that the book is loaded with nice pictures, interesting maps and diagrams is a great plus.  Nice enough for a coffee table, deep enough for a serious library.	2001-11-11

Also, it is more and more misused as people settle for the quick fix approach of the system, the labelling of people and an expected (or rather hoped for) predictability of people's attitudes and reactions.  Some of us amateurs understand that this is not a labelling tool, but a sophisticated tool to understand some of the aspects of human thought process; and that it is not easy to always assert the psychological type of the person that we are dealing with.  Naomi Quenck offers us another way to look at the role of type in our lives, by looking at the obscure side of psychological type, the side that \\"generalists\\" gloss over pretending that we are all great and beautiful.  We are not.  She clearly explains that under grip experience, or Jungian shadow as you might have it, the negative side of our personalities can act up.  The understanding of this dark side of course helps us in our individuation process.  And also help us in understanding some of the reasons that bring our loved ones into trouble, perhaps allowing us to help them more effectively without any of the sentimental language that we find in so many \\"help and self help\\" books.  Also we can use the examination of grip experiences to ... the true type of the people that surround us and for whom we cannot get a clear idea of their actual type, be it due to their secretiveness, their need to conform to society's norms or any other reason.  Grip experiences do not lie.  It is to the credit of Naomi Quenck to have written a book that does not sugar coat what type is about, yet of easy access by its organization and good redaction.	2001-08-15

Well, things do happen but they are not very exciting.  It is a mark of rare skill for a writer to hold the attention of the reader with sparse prose, short sentences, plain life tales, for long enough until the reader gets engrossed enough in the tale to stay.  As the book unfolds, one gets the point of the style: a boring style to illustrate the boring life, of boring people, in a boring Chinese outpost, in the boring years of communist China.  Even the great political turmoils are only a distant echo for these people set in a life of routine protected in the safe setting of a hospital.  This is the really the secret of the book, to tell us that the oppressive system of Maoist China was a fitting continuation of the oppressive social values that allowed for such a revolution.  Women perhaps had their feet bound before, but they still cannot date freely since the eyes of people watch any deviance, political or personal.  Men now could aspire to a divorce from a loveless arranged marriage, but they still recur too often to loveless arranged marriage. In the 50ies and 60ies Chinese did not fare much better on a personal level than before.  China is China, always full of people and watching eyes.  The only refuge is blandness.  At the end of the book we do not care much for the fates of the book's heroes.  They followed the rules and pretty much got what they deserved.  What we feel is a great sadness for the millions of lives that flickered through half a century of Communist, lives unable to risk anything, to tempt happiness, without any real hope but those that society would allow, never those that they could forge for themselves, even within the frame-works of these rules.  A great loss.  It is a great book forces you out of the book, into thoughts on how society oppresses you and makes you do what is not good for you, while making you think it is good..	2001-03-23

Mr. Norwich is of the school of Historians that are more interested in the stories of History rather than serving detailed studies of what really did go on in those times.  Of course this has a clear objective: make today's short attention span reader care a little bit about ancient times by serving them a novel like book.  On this basis he must be judged for this trilogy on the Byzantine Empire.  And he succeeds quite well, in particular in the first book of the saga where semi mythical emperors and empresses come to live.  The main fault is that perhaps Mr. Norwich is a little bit too casual, and, as many a British school historian, a little bit too much interested in some prurient aspects of the story.  Yet the narrative flows, our interest is maintained and we come to care for these people who although almost totally alien to our way of thinking still show us that human nature is human nature.  I am not sure if this type of narration is to everybody's taste since Mr. Norwich is keen in showing the folly of his characters, regardless of their faith, role in national myths etc...  I suppose that if you are a man of deep faith, or a Greek nationalist you might not like some of the zingers that pepper the text of these books.  It would be a pity to reject the work on such points.  What is at stake here is to bring back to us the story of a millennial Empire that for better or for worse we owe so much to.	2001-03-18

Not only the story of missed opportunities and human greed, but the method of the tale.  It still gets 4 stars because it is amusing to read, it gives us a simplified perspective of a rather complicated period and makes fell sad for the last defenders of Constantinople/Byzantium.  But the book has methodological flaws.  After the fall of Byzantium to the Crusaders, it became a minor power in the region.  Whatever importance it had was due as much to its strong defenses as to the weakness of its opponents.  When the first decided conqueror since the 4th crusade came, it fell as it should have felt earlier.  It was clear that since 1214 Venice was the political and military heir of Byzantium.  Mr. Norwich fails to show that here, too enamored of his subject to be objective.  To tell a tale it is good to fixate some, but to make us understand the undercurrents that drove the show it is not good.  Almost nothing about the economical conditions comes through.  One really has a hard time from the book understanding how the break up of the Empire could last as long as it did before the Turks took over.  And one hungers to know more about the parts of the Empire that went solo after the initial break up.  For example I would have liked to know more about Mistra who is dealt with almost as an after thought.  Yet, as a tale of despair and tragedy, as an example of how a great civilization slowly dies, Mr. Norwich narrative is excellent for our days when few people would bother reading Mr. Gibbons story.  They might at least want to get the gossip from Mr. Norwich.	2001-03-18

It reminds us that it was during the 800-1000 period that the resistance of Byzantium to Islam, and other \\"barbarians\\" was a key factor in allowing Western Europe to develop and secure its basis for its future civilization.  It is in this book that we see best our debt to Byzantium.  It remains that it is in this second book of the trilogy that we start to see some of the flaws of Mr. Norwich methods.  His almost exclusive interest in lining up facts starts playing against his narrative.  In the first book, some of the motors of history were simpler.  In the period here described things get more complex.  It would be very helpful for some of us to have a clear description of which were the main trade routes and products traded, the evolution of the human population and repartition, etc...  How can one understand all the wars that took place during those centuries?  Are we supposed to assume that the Slavs invaders just woke up one day and said \\"Gee, I guess I will attack Byzantium today\\".  Still, the story is interesting and the books are nicely complemented with illustrations and charts though maps are not as helpful as they should be.  With so many wars it would have been good to show maps with a few arrows that pointed the main areas of attack and vulnerability of the diverse countries surrounding Byzantium.	2001-03-18

This is one of the essential books that bring a solid perspective on what is the reality of history, not what commentators or national prides would like it to be..  Braudel is one of the most gifted historians of this century, and few like him can go into the inner workings of the social and economical mechanisms that drive history, really.  In this well written volume, excellently translated, one sees clearly where laid the \\"center\\" of the Western world in the XVI century: The Mediterranean.  Assuredly, the gold of the Americas was coming in; and the North Sea and Baltic trades were going on briskly.  Nevertheless, Venice still mattered.  The Mediterranean links remained the prize for Spain, the Ottoman empire and whomever had access to the locked sea.  Yet, the future was close and the through the XVI there were clear signs of the shifts in power to come.  Mr. Braudel work is as comprehensive as it gets.  This is a gigantic canvas of the Mediterranean of the time, from its geographical and climatic descriptions, to the way that the Ottoman Empire raised money for its needs.  We do not have a single hero in this almost novelistic type of work, everybody gets its turn under the sun.  The result is a deeper understanding of where we come from.  Even if today you live in Fairbanks, Alaska, you will feel strangely linked to the Venetian Pepper trade of the times.....	2001-03-17

And of course to think about what is the core of human nature and how come it has not changed that much after all.  The book is well written and the translation superb.  The read takes time because we must stop to think, we must go back to read, we need to understand.  Reading this book is truly a journey of the mind, a journey that we can at any time go back to by picking up the book later and opening it at any chapter.

In addition it makes you think beyond the what-if usual questions that one does consider when reading such a book.  You think about all the myths that are created about historical events, even today.  You think at how division can ruin even the mightiest empires.  And how often might is illusion.  You think at all the misery that was brought to a country.

To bring some new perspective to the possible sanctioning of gay unions, historian John Boswell tried to look for evidence of same sex blessed unions in the early European middle ages.  Certainly homosexuality was viewed quite differently in earlier times and Christian faith condemned it rather late, somewhat simultaneously with the advent of celibacy in the clergy.  In this book, Mr. Boswell presents us his findings and comments.  Indeed there is some serious evidence that same sex union were at least more than tolerated a millenium ago.  The book is thus an interesting read and helps us consider in a different light some specious arguments presented today to deny civil recognition for homosexual unions.  Unfortunately, the book suffers from wanting to say more than what the findings warrant.  A pity since the mere fact of finding evidence for same sex unions is already quite telling even if it is not clear in some cases whether it was only a special friendship recognition or a bona fide carnal union recognition.  Perhaps the haste at which the book was written and edited explains this, since Mr. Boswell was sick and died around the time of publication. That haste might be deduced from the fact that 25% of the book are notes, and the feeling that ones get upon finishing it that the book could have been at least 50 pages shorter.  Still, a convincing case for getting out of today's conventional parameters for marriage is hinted by this book: clearly Mr. Boswell shows us that marriage and homosexuality were not that contrary centuries ago, and did not hinder the development of Western Civilization.  And I might add, this book makes us wonder where Mr. Boswell's desire to chart new path of historical research would have lead him, and with what findings he would have regaled us.  Not to mention how much stronger the book could have been with a tighter editing and criticism.	2001-03-05

To appreciate this book at its true worth one does need to do some homework.  Understanding a little bit of the political complexities that surrounded the end of the independence wars and the start of the nation building process would help to gain a perspective to allow a better appreciation of a narration that pretends to present us a sick, depressed Bolivar. Yet, even if you refuse to do that home work, it will be a very good read.  We are not in 100 Years of Solitude anymore here.  This book has an odd sense of reality since it focuses more to the inner workings of Bolivar's mind, and his way of facing the end.  Perhaps what makes the book really interesting it to see the image that Bolivar has over the cultural elites of Northern South Ameica, his legacy that for better or for worse inspires great writer like Garcia Marquez, or opportunistic politicians like we can see today in Venezuela.  Reading how Garcia Marquez imagines the end of the Bolivarian epic is more fascinating than the story itself.	2001-03-03

He spent his life creating whole new concepts, one after the other.  It will take decades to develop some of the theories that he postulated first, some still like rough diamonds that will need lots of polishing.  This is an example of the work that needs to be done.  The exploration of our dark side is one of those goals that we must achieve and the view expressed in this book is fascinating and worthwhile absorbing into our thought process.  The only problem is that it is a rather hard read, not for the novice or quick self-help book seeker.	2001-02-27

When I read this book for some reason I was reminded of Garcia Marquez and his 100 Years of Solitude.  The town of Excellent, Idaho has the same fantastic feel of end of the road as Macondo had.  And the characters are as loony and misfits as Buendia and his relatives were.  Except that now we are dealing with bisexual, or was that really gay, characters, overt prostitutes and all the little world of the remote frontier station.  The harshness of the frontier is vividly recreated among the anything goes atmosphere of these people that had run away of everything and just could not be bothered anymore with details and conventions.  I did not care much for all the spiritual subtext but somehow it went well with the story, as the author convinces you to forget about your points of reference and let yourself go elsewhere.  The writing is excellent and I shall look forward more writing from this author, which by now is overdue.	2001-02-23

We just go through the readings, the reflections.  We are touched.  We are not.  In a way, this selection of writings from May Sarton shows us the personal discoveries that photographer Edith Royce Schade made.  May Sarton had a rather eventful life.  The daughter of Belgian immigrants, a woman with many dalliances, a demanding lover to her lesbian loves.  But she also was an American, a long time resident of New England, a no-nonsense woman.  And her poetry speaks to all of us, to the travels and trials of our lives.  The choices of Ms. Royce Schade are excellent.  The pictures that she took and selected to accompany the anthology are delicate, artistic, feminine, intimate.  Her portraits of the aging Sarton show the strong woman that she was, fighting age but accepting it.  Ms. Royce Schade divided her choices in 6 sections that reflect how as a photographer she was influenced by the writings.  Light for the light of the image.  Solitude for the solitude of the photographer behind her lens.  The Natural World that the photographer observes.  The Love for its subjects.  The Time to observe them.  And the Creation Itself.  My favorite section, the one that moved me most was Solitude, the Solitude of the individual when all is said and done.  It includes the wonderful poem on aging, \\"Gestalt at Sixty\\" and powerful photographs of the harsh New England winter landscapes.  Rarely you will find such a personal and telling anthology, such a tender tribute.  Simply superb.	2001-02-23

Well, if America seems to have the most numerous amount of gay and lesbian writers, other national literatures are giving it a run for its money as for content and quality.  I cannot wait until this excellent novel is translated to English.  I hope the translation will render accurately the exquisite writing style of Mr. Christopher Donner, erstwhile children book writer and now gifted gay novelist.  This probably semi autobiographical novel follows the travails of the narrator, a movie maker, as he tries to keep alive his love with a Nicaraguan exile, through France, Russia, and elsewhere.  Mere excuses to narrate how love evolves with distance, desire, opportunity.  The title of the book suggests that there are several quantifiable forms of love.  But the joke is on the reader.  Love is love, whether you are gay or straight, whether you run after it or run from it.  The sufferings are as intense, the rewards as delightful.  If the difficulties in which the narrator falls could be representative of a gay relationship in trouble, it still remains that the troubles are clearly due to the weakness of human nature, and our emotional selfishness, rather than from any particular manner of having sex.  The book is superbly written, poetic in tone.  The narrative has a dreamy character that makes you feel that you are an active confident of the narrator, more than the semi diary structure of the book.  The pace is relaxed but never puts down.  Slowly you are taken by the narrative and if it is not a page turner it is because the author forces you to stop and think about what you just read, and about what you did when you loved.  A gem of a book.	2001-02-23

The impact was enormous.  I even went to a signing event an hour away from where I lived.  What made this book great was that not only it talked about the real tragedy in rural, little educated America, that AIDS wrought there, but it was finely written, with feeling, and instructive.  Such a rare blend in this type of litterture.  This was not a report from the front, it was also the journey of a man whose whole life principles are challenged, and changed in front of other people's tragedy.  Today, as I read it again, it has already that flavor of historical witnessing, but its emotion is still fresh.  For those of us that are blase about too many tragedies in our lifes, we could read this book again to regain some of the compassion that we might have misplaced as our everyday life demanded our atention.	2001-02-23

I have first to confess that this is the first one of Mr. Ford book that I read; and it is certainly good enough to get another one.  Curiously after reading randomly a few assays, I was reminded of Erma Bombeck, and her &quot;non-glamour&quot; tales of day to day life in suburbia.  Well, Mr. Ford does the same for gay life here, showing that gay people would perhaps go more often to bars or be more glamorous if they did not have to spend time holding a job and dealing with everyday life.  A gay everyday life but an everyday life nevertheless.  Perhaps it is a sign that gay writing has &quot;arrived&quot; when you get in your hands a book of gay middle class tales that your Mom can read.  And perhaps even smile in spite of herself.  Who knows, she might even lend it to her neighbour....	2001-02-19

Or to criticize him for stressing some stuff that actually does not seem very important in trying to understand such a great civilization relations with the world.  The strength of this book, for me, resides more in its quality of case study on how a culture is seen by people ignorant of that very same culture.  Today, in spite of Internet and CNN we can see too many examples of generalizations toward other cultures (all latinos eat hot spicy foods).  Mr. Spence gives us a very enjoyable book, apparently well documented, instructive, and that makes us think about what happens today when we look above our fence.  A very worthy read.	2001-02-04

The novelty bloom has faded some.  Bechdel has courageously taken the route of allowing her characters to age.  And the series has to pay the price for it.  But this is for the best as we do age too and our affection toward Bechdel's cast grows since we can relate to them, no matter whether we are men or women.  When Clarice and Toni try to raise their son in suburbia, their life has gotta become duller, even if it is still more exiting than their neighbour's life.  Food for thought for us aging homos.  It is a tribute to Bechdel talent that she weathers this transition and manages to bring more than the occasional flash of brilliance that she has shown on her previous work.  It bodes well for the future as the excitement in the life of her heroines will come back when their progenies start dating, retirement planning becomes a priority, dates are not as easy too find, &quot;remedial&quot; surgery might be considered, etc...  I, for one, will make sure that I do not miss a beat.	2001-02-04

Among interesting details you can find that oysters were not on ration cards. This by itself speaks volumes..... If I chime in is to say that as the son of French folks that got bombed during the war, Miss Vassiltchikov allowed me to get a new perspective to all those tales of woe that I grew up with.  If non German folks suffered a lot, it was no picnic for the Germans either, and perhaps a lot of them did not really measure what was really happening to the world as they knew it. This book has a very curious effect: on one hand one blames further the German elite that failed to stop Hitler; on the other hand one does wonder up to what point this elite was in large part a victim too. For better or for worse history belongs to the death camp victims as well as to the airhead elite of Germany. The reason one needs to read this book.	2001-02-04

And this was a &quot;notable&quot; New York Times book?  I cannot be accused of insensitivity: as a white male I read in a single sitting &quot;the color purple&quot; for example.  And I was quite impacted by it.  But this one rings fake to me.  Yes, the idea of illustrating a not very glorious episode of the Dominican Republic history is good.  Telling the story of the suffering of the cane cutters from Haiti has to be done.  But I live in Venezuela, in a sugar cane growing area, and that book does not ring true to me.  The characters are floating above their condition, not quite connecting to what it all means.  Perhaps this is due to the language.  The author might have overreached in trying to bring to life the language differences between creole speaking Haitians and Upper class Spaniards and Dominicans.  Had the book been written in Spanish or French it might have worked, but in English it sounded more like a native versus tourist scene......	2000-12-18
