Russell's insights into Lee Wournos have always been very enlightening and she writes beautifully in post form.  I was very disappointed when I opened the book and started to read.  The narrative was jumbled and jumped about.  The intermingling of british and american english was annoying.  And her lack of knowledge when it comes to american slang...what can I say?  She would make Yogi Beara cringe - (e.g. &quot;his Irish Brogue was so thick you could cut it with a dull butter knife&quot; - a mix of &quot;It was so thick you could cut it with a knife&quot;, and &quot;such-and-such was so soft you could cut it with a dull/butter knife&quot;) - and never should have been used.<br />I also found the book to be long and drawn out. This book could have, and should have, been cut in half at the least, and not written at best.  I'm not sure who her editors were, but they really dropped the ball on this one, then again, so did Sue Russell.<br />A side note to one reviewer who didn't like that the victims had been portrayed as upstanding citizens in the book -- that we should not forget why they were there &quot;to engaged in sexual activity&quot;.  That is totally not true.  There is no evidence at all to suggest that ALL of the men had been sexually active with Lee Wournos.  Many of them were found fully clothed  -- this is covered in the book.  The victims were tragically killed and it does not matter one way or another if some of them were killed after having sex with Lee.  It only matters that Lee killed them.	2004-06-30

This is an excellent book when looking for the truth about America and it's history.  There are many out there that claim that this book is a lot of nonesense.   They do not want to look at reality.  <br />This country was founded on blood, sweat and tears of amazing men and women.  Men and Women who wanted to see their dreams live on, who wanted to be free from the tyranical rule of England.  What they dreamed of, is not the reality of America. Our government is all about greed, arrogance and getting more.  It does not care who it has to step on to get it.  Not even it's own people.  This book takes care to note that the America we were striving for did not come to fruition.  <br />Jefferson, Adams, Washington all said when it comes to foreign policy stay out of it.  We get right in the middle of it.  We start wars with countries that just want us to leave them alone.  We take money from our poor and give it to our rich.  We let people become homeless and sick so that our American Corporations can make another buck by outsourcing our jobs.  We do not take care of our old, our sick, and our poor.  We think about me, me, me.  How can I get more?  How can I get better?  Not how can I help out!  <br />We ALL as a country need to come together and fix the wrongs that have been made.  We need to say &quot;No more!&quot; No more to big business, No more to outsourcing, No more to cheap, expendable merchandize, No more to leaving our people in the street to starve and die!  NO MORE!  <br />If you think that this great country is great, you need to look again.  Look at how a new world order is in the making.  Look at how we're losing our middle class.  Look at how we're losing our freedoms, our privacy, and our right to choose.   The direction we're moving in is not the one that I want to go in, and I know if our founding fathers were alive to see this they'd be taking the next boat out to parts unknown.<br />We need to take responsibility for what we have done, what we continue to do, and what we need to do.  We need to apologize for stealing this land.  We need to apology for having Mrs. Smith's only son Johnny killed in a War we had no business being in.  We need to apologize to the middle easterners and get the hell out of their (see that? THEIR) country.  We need to stop spending money on surveys and studies on things no one cares about and start spending more money on Education, Medical Costs, Prescriptions, Creating Jobs for our Citizens.  We need to pay attention to America and it's people.   Zinn points this out every step of the way in his book.<br />THIS IS A MUST READ!<br />This is for the man from the Soviet Union - true Communism is not what you had in the Soviet Union.  To say that Marx's doctrin did not pan out in the USSR would be like saying that you used Apples in a Cherry Pie and couldn't understand why it wasn't a Cherry Pie.   The USSR called it Communism but it wasn't.  It was more of a Dictatorship with some Capitalism thrown in (Yes, I did say Capitalism - if you don't believe me go read some more history).	2004-06-17

Pat Brown might be the CEO of S.H.E but that does not mean that she knows anything.   Watch any of her T.V appearances or read any of her books and you will see that she contradicts herself, she stumbles over herself, and she plain out-and-out is clueless in many of the areas of serial killing, homicide, profiling, et al.   This book is no exception.   Pat Brown has no schooling, education or degree in any of the areas that she &quot;sells&quot; in her &quot;business&quot;.   I have seen her give answers on I, Detective and get them wrong from what every single other law enforcement person has stated.   This book contains mis-information, contradictions, and theory.  Don't waste your time or your money, buy a book by someone who has the education and the knowledge to back up what they're saying.

It was a fantastic book.  The story intriged me so much that when I saw Deadly Kin, I purchased it.  What a waste of money.<br />The brother of Susie Lynch tells &quot;his&quot; perception of what happened.  It wasn't very realistic.  He tried to remove nearly all the blame from Susie Lynch and put it all on Fritz Klenner.  Now, don't get me wrong, Klenner was responsible for the murders, however, Susie was not just an &quot;innocent, who was confused&quot; as Newsome would like us all to believe.<br />Trotter' chapters in the book aren't much better.  The writing is poor, the flow of the book is poor, and the entire purpose of putting out this book utterly ridiculous.<br />The book does not delve deep enough to shed any new light on this crime.  You could have learned more just by reading the newspaper accounts.<br />It's this writer's opinion that that Robert Newsome wanted to grab some of the limelight for himself, and make a little extra cash on the side, while exploiting his &quot;fame&quot; by being related to both victim and killer.  He would have been better off writing a book about himself, his drug addition, his own family matters, etc.  It would have been more interesting.	2004-04-13

I wonder who Mr. Osuna &quot;got to&quot; at amazon.com to have all of the unfavorable reviews deleted?  Here is my original review which I stand behind 100%.  <br />**************<BR>&quot;I bought this book hoping to gain more insight into the terrible tragedy that was the Defeo murders.  Instead, I paid [MONEY] for a book that has mis-spellings, incorrect usage of words, and poor grammar.<br />The book claims to finally put the &quot;truth&quot; in the public eye.  Not one thing this author claims can be backed up.  When he references documents, he later states they have since been &quot;destroyed&quot;, mainly, he claims, by the Mafia.  He continually contradicts himself, and not just from chapter to chapter but sometimes in follow up sentences.  <br />All named &quot;accomplices&quot; are now deceased and can not refute the outlandish accusations that this man makes. <br />At one point he talks about the body of Dawn Defeo being moved by the police to take crime scene photographs because &quot;her bed indicated a struggle&quot;.  I find it interesting that he does not reproduce these alleged photos in his book, but rather shows her in her own bed.  So, which is it?  Was she moved, or wasn't she? Why would they take TWO sets of photos as he claims?<br />He also claims that he could not get the crime scene photos, the trial transcripts or any other documentation by way of Freedom of Information.  It wasn't until MUCH later that he was able to get this information.  Why then, have OTHER people had no trouble getting this?<br />The only two reasons I can come up with that this book was written are the following:<br />1 - He wanted to make money without having to share profits with the History Channel or George Lee Lutz, both of who he'd worked with in the past on this.<br />2 - He befriended Ronald Jr's supposed ex-wife Geraldine Gates &quot;Defeo&quot; (who, by the way, clams the &quot;mob&quot; destroyed all evidence of her marriage to him in the 70's) and wantedto help her and Ronald Jr.  The book claims that Ronald Jr. did not murder the children, which is pretty much the only thing he believes is holding him back from parole.<br />My opinion, keep Defeo in jail.  If one could get convicted of poor writing and making up tall tales Mr. Osuna would be in a cell right next to Defeo. <br />Don't waste your money, pass this book right by&quot;.<br />********<BR>Additional Comments:<br />I have since seen the picture that Mr. Osuna at first claims was Dawn Defeo's body in the basement.  The picture is of a young girl in a bed.  Mr. Osuna NOW claims that the unidentified young girl was yet another victim at 112 Ocean Avenue.  He claims the picture was taken in the basement, in a spare bedroom.  Too bad the Defeo basement didn't have a huge window in it, as the picture clearly shows.  His &quot;evidence&quot; is garbage.  His only agenda in writing this book was to get even with George Lutz and sucker us all out of our money.	2003-10-07
US	43699416	R176XOGV0AGY52	0517097273	105401731	Cruel Doubt	Books	1	12	34	N	N	Interesting Reviews/Comments	I did not think much of this book.  <br />First, I found it quite interesting that Bonnie Von Stein had very similar injuries as Jeffrey MacDonald, and McGinnis thinks he's guilty and Bonnie isn't. It seems that McGinnis switches &quot;sides&quot; depending on payment.  Also, Wade Smith, Bonnie Von Stein's attorney, brought McGinnis into this case.  Smith was also involved to some degree with the MacDonald case. <br />Secondly, McGinnis tells the tale solely from Bonnie Von Stein's point of view.  He did not dig into anything that would point in her direction (and there is a lot!).  Yet another change from the way he handled Fatal Vision.<br />Lastly, when McGinnis discusses other parties involved, he does so from a stand point where one would believe he had actually spoken with these people.  He did not.  His book is nearly 100% based on what Bonnie said, what Bonnie did, how Bonnie reacted, ad naseum. <br />A final note about some of the other reviews.  <br />   1- Upchurch did not get a retrial.  Upchurch's death sentence was vacated on appeal under McKoy due to faulty jury instructions.  He was granted a resentencing hearing.  At that hearing he was resentenced, this time to life in prison.  He will not be eligible for parole for about 40 years (2 life sentences - consecutive).<br />   2 - There was never evidence that Upchurch was involved.  Neither Henderson nor Pritchard could corroborate each others stories. The information they provided varied widely!  There was not one single piece of physical evidence.  The murderer was right handed.  Upchurch is left handed.  If this intrigues you, check out [...]<br />And also, stick to Bledsoe's Blood Games.  A better read, a better understanding of the case and people involved, and a much better writing style!	2003-10-02

I'll point out just a couple:<br />At one point he speaks about  &quot;Los Angelos' Zodiac Killer&quot; - a small amount of research would have shown that Zodiac was in and around the San Francisco Area (Vallejo, Presido, Lake Berryessa).  He also states that New York's Son of Sam spree was exactly one year from July 1976- July 1977, this also is incorrect.<br />Unless you're looking for a biography of John Douglas, save your money.

I literally had to put it down for a couple of weeks at a time, or I'd have never finished it. There was too much detail... way too much detail.  If I had read one more instance about a pie being baked the day of the murder I would have screamed.<br />Capote is more than sympathetic toward Perry thus the book is not written objectively.  He comes to the point of almost saying that the Clutter family was responsible for their own deaths.  But even HE can't cross that line. Perhaps this would have been a better read had Capote not gotten the hots for Perry Smith. He tried so hard to make Perry look misunderstood, pitiful, and less culpable than Hickcock.<br />For all the hype ..., I was sadly disappointed in this so-called Classic.	2002-08-09

You'll find the same quotes from chapter to chapter.  While reading a chapter all of a sudden the authors will change subjects, sometimes without finishing the thought that they were working on.  This makes the book a somewhat difficult read.<br />In some instances in the book,  family members are given pseudonyms when it's not really called for.  For example, the authors repeatedly call Mary Brunner, Marie O'Brien.  At the same time they have a photo of Mary Brunner with the right name captioned.  Made absolutely no sense to me at all.  Her role in the family is also downplayed.  She appears in the book only a few times.  Her role in the Hinman murders is also downplayed.<br />There are also instances where some of the picture captions are incorrect.  There is a picture of the \\"girls\\" on a garbage run that lists Gypsy - Catherine Share - as one of those in the picture.  She's not in the picture.  However, Mary Brunner is, and yet she's not listed.<br />It would appear to me that there was very little verification or editing done with this book.  You would expect, at the very least, for a re-released (with additions) book, that SOMEONE would have had the forethought to review and edit it.<br />Lastly, the addition of new photos to the book are uncalled for.  There is no reason, whatsoever, to put in death photos. The photos do not in any way enhance this book, they actually diminish it.  The pictures are gruesome and brutal. Why not show the vibrant faces of the victims as they were in living, not as they were in death?  The only pictures of the victims, other than the death photos, are of Sharon Tate.  Somehow the other victims always seem to get lost.<br />Not exactly a book I'd recommend to anyone other than those that want to fill their  \\"Manson Library\\".d to anyone other than those that want to fill their  \\"Manson Library\\".	2002-07-09

I was so entranced I couldn't put it down.   I've read the book at least a 1/2 dozen times since then.  Each time I read it I find something new, a twist, or a turn that I missed the time before, which adds new dimension to the story.  <br />Some reviewers see this book as being Biased.  Biased at who? The murderers?  The men that planned and partook in the slaughter of three innocent children? All of the men who were present at the time of the murders, as well as in the planning of the murders, have confessed during the years since the murders.<br />The officer who spent all his waking time tracking down the killers of these kids should be commended. The author should also be commended. The book does what a good true crime book is supposed to do: it points out all the aspects of the crime are, and who the guilty party(ies) are. <br />This is a must have for any true crime library!	2002-07-03

Carol's book is a much better documented account of Ramirez, due in part, because Carlo actually interviewed Ramirez numerous times.  <br />If you really don't care that the information is correct or you just want a macabe story to read, then by all means, get this book.  Otherwise, buy Carlo's book, you'll be happy you did.	2002-07-03

This book should be avoided like the plague.   It's not worth the paper that it's written on.<br />I bought this book to get a glimpse of Van Houten. I didn't \\"see\\" the things I was supposed to \\"see\\".<br />Van Houten wants out, so Van Houten will do whatever she can to get out.  She claims she didn't stab Rosemary LaBianca until she was dead. She claims she stabbed her 16 times.  LaBianca was only stabbed 13 times AFTER death.   But all that is a moot point.  She was INVOLVED in a brutal killing.  She was INVOLVED in the Tate murder as an accessory both before and after the fact.  She was INVOVLED in a murder that took place during a burglary.  She was convicted and sentenced to death.  This woman should be thrilled that she is still alive.  She does not deserve to be paroled.  She does not deserve to be free.  She did not give that consideration to her victim(s) so she then should not be given that consideration.<br />Van Houten says she's a model prisoner and deserves to be free.  She was also a model high school student and homecoming princess.  So right after being a model high school student she became a murderer.  How do we know that after being a model prisoner she will not go right back to being a murderer? <br />She has proven herself to be a cold blooded murderer.  At her parole hearings she won't look at the family, she won't apologize to the family.  She might be saying the right things, but she doesn't mean them.<br />Also, she claims that since she wasn't as devoted a Manson family member as the others she could be rehabilitated.  Well, damn, not as brainwashed and yet she STILL committed the crime?  Interesting prospective.  Less culpable for the crime? No.  More deserving of parole?  NO.  Keep her locked up and throw away the key? Yes!  Life in prison should equal LIFE IN PRISON.  Do your time- you already committed your crime.	2002-07-01

When one is saved and one lives in the joy of having a personal relationship with the Lord, one does not lie.  But lie Susan Atkins still does.  During the course of the book she denies any involvment in the actual killing of Sharon Tate - something that she has freely admitted -for years.  Something that she bragged about - for years.  An act that she said she was giddy doing. That she said brought her immense pleasure.   <br />Now, all of a sudden, she's saved, and wham! Susan didn't kill Sharon Tate!  Wow, all those years of saying \\"I did it and I enjoyed it\\" turn to \\"I'm saved in our Lord Jesus Christ and I didn't kill Sharon Tate\\". <br />So, take much of what she says in the book with a grain of salt. I don't believe her, and you probably shouldn't either.  <br />Under normal circumstances I would have given this book a 1 rating, but it is written BY Susan Atkins and so I give it a 2 mostly for those who are major \\"Manson Addicts\\".	2002-07-01

I love Louise Hay books. I own almost all of her stuff.  <br />She writes in a very down to earth way, in very clear easy to understand language.  Her books also work!  I have dealt with and overcome several issues by using her books.  <br />However, with this Compaion book, I have to ask myself \\"Why?\\"  It is almost identical in nature to the You Can Heal Your life Workbook.   If you own that, there is little need to purchase this companion.    While there are three or so new \\"chapters\\", the lay out, and most of the content is the same as the Workbook.  <br />I was a bit confused by the other review on this book, because this book is almost journal-like in nature.  There are sections for each issue in your life, with affirmations (Louise loves her affirmations), checklists, and then questions that you answer pretty much in journal form.  Louise also includes exercises to perform to help you to open up to the affirmations that will help you heal your life. <br />Louise has before published several books that are almost identical in nature to previously published books.  Be careful when you're purchasing her stuff.  Just because the title is different doesn't mean the book is.  Check the content out well first!  It'll save you some money.	2002-05-30

Wow, was I ever wrong. While McGinnis spends all his time talking about Bonnie Von Stein and her son, Christopher Pritchard (He wrote the book with her help), Bledsoe spends more time getting to know the other parties alledgedly involved, Neal Henderson, and James Upchurch. <br />Bledose is objective about all the participants, including the victims. McGinnis tries to portray the son as a victim of drug abuse and wants you to feel sympathetic towards him. So many things do not add up, yet Mcginnis tries to pigeon hole it all away with statements like \\"...that's just the way she is\\" or \\"...the drugs clouded his vision he didn't know what he was saying or doing during that time frame\\" (paraphrased from Cruel Doubt).<br />While reading this book I noticed a number of things that lead me to believe that the entire truth was not brought out at trial. In some instances there were major discrepancies in the testimonies of Neal Henderson and Chris Pritchard. Things just did not add up. I wonder about the overzealousness of the police to capture someone because they happened to have a previous infraction. I wonder about the jury who convicted based solely on the two statements with major inconsistencies made by confessed killers. <br />This is a very interesting book, that gives you things to think about. <br />Jerry Bledsoe is spellbindingly brilliant once again. A must have for your true crime library.	2002-05-27

For some reason people believe that this book - \\"Ted Bundy:  conversations with a killer\\" - was the first time Bundy had discussed his crimes. It wasn't.  Bundy talked in the third person about his crimes with Michaud and Anyesworth for their book \\"The Only Living Witness\\".<br /><br />Bundy also spoke with Keppel about his crimes in \\"Riverman- Ted Bundy and I hunt for the Green River Killer\\",  which again has Ted speaking in the 'third' person about his own crimes as well as the Green River killings.<br /><br />In my opinion Keppel's book is far superior than this one. This book is the same old same old that was presented in Witness.  It's nothing more than edited versions of the notes and interviews that Michaud had from the making of Witness.  They'd been there -- and done this before.<br /><br />Conversations does have some interesting twists and turns to it, but mainly is nothing more than Bundy playing the games he has always played. Bundy the master manipulator all the way to the end.<br /><br />If you are interested in Bundy there are other books out there that fit the bill better:  The Stranger Beside Me, The Deliberate Stranger, and The Only Living Witness.	2002-05-20

I could barely put this book down, it was that good. <br />Mr. Keppel who was a lead investigator on both the Green River Killings and the infamous Ted Murders masterfully exposes Ted Bundy as to who and what he really was. He also uses the 'insider' knowledge that Bundy possessed to help investigators solve the Green River Killings.  <br />I thought that the book was extremely well written, and chillingly factual. The points where Bundy is confessing to his crimes is an edge-of-the-seat experience. <br />The Green River case, as well as the Bundy confessions, makes this a must-have for any true crime library. I would suggest it to any avid true crime buff.	2002-05-20

However the words that are attributed to Manson, in my opinion were the author's own words.  Not a bad read, but not something I would recommend to someone looking for the 'truth'.	2002-04-25

I had been a fan of hers for several years but hadn't read this story yet.  She brings the people involved in this case to life.  <br />What David Brown did to his family is unthinkable. He molested his wife's sister, he manipulated his 14 year old daughter into killing his wife and then sat back and enjoyed his freedom and the insurance money from the death of his wife.  <br />While he lounged in a nearly 1/2 a million dollar home, now married to his late wife's sister, his daughter sat in the Ventura School (a youth prison).  If not for three men, who went above and beyond the call of duty, David Brown would never have been convicted.  Kudos to Jay Newell, Jeoff Robinson and Fred McLean.
