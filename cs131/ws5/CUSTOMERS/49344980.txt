Roth makes this event and its aftermath credible as alternative history, which is the strength of the novel.  Unfortunately, it is not nearly as well written as we might expect from such an author, and in fact I found that the novel did not really come alive until perhaps halfway through.   <br />     Two of the problems are the character, Alvin, and the choice of a narrator who is initially 8 years old.  Alvin goes off to fight the Nazi's by volunteering in Canada. This might have been the basis of an exploration of what a Jewish US citizen owed to his fellow Jews in Europe, but it wasn't, and the character proves more a distraction and page filler than anything else.  The narrator is a nicely written character, but as a young boy, he is not the best choice as an observer.  As the boy ages, this remedies itself. In fact, as the book progresses the mother and her sister and even the father come more alive, and the plot quickens, both for the family and the country.  The novel also begins to work as social history of a closely knit, lower middle class community.  <br />     In the novel's wrap up, mention is made of a book about the events written by the Rabbi.  I believe Roth is poking fun at conspiracy theories and the motivations of those who write them, but some reviewers apparently fail to distinguish between the Rabbi's book, and what Roth purports to have happened.	2005-10-11

It is a classical tragedy in that  the disintegration is largely due to the pride of the father; pride causes him to have undue satisfaction in his country club membership, and pride causes his subsequent failure to come to terms with his daughter's misfortune, or to adapt to a less successful role in the world, so that he falls farther than he should have. Fittingly, all the other family members achieve redemption, although one could argue that the happy ending is artificially grafted onto the body of the novel.  I accept the happy ending, but I think Oates went overboard: did Mike Jr. have to somehow have earned a college degree, for example, and becoming a physical therapist, as Patrick does, also requires years of training.  Oates draws significance out of the little details of everyday life, and vividly portrays several member of the family. Portraying Marianne, with her spirituality and reactions to hurt,  was a special challenge, one Oates successfully meets; Marianne very slowly heals, until she is capable of marriage. I did not feel as comfortable with Patrick, but I do find him plausible. Oates' prose style is  forceful, but sometimes borders on the overdone, and while I enjoyed the book, I could understand a reader who felt differently.   Example of a sentence which works despite itself:  \\"With that strange fated compulsion with which swirling water is drawn down a drain, each discrete molecule and atom seeming pressed for extinction, Marianne felt a wildness come over her\\".	2005-10-06
US	49344980	R2VBH0AV068CBP	0241136539	904874754	In the Beauty of the Lillies	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Not Updike's best, but still very good.	In the Beauty of the Lillies is a multi-generational family novel, focusing on one member of each generation.   Two of these characters are not typical of literary family novels: a child who grows up to be a successful actress, and a cultist involved in a Waco like incident. Updike manages to make both of these \\"sensational\\" characters credible and understandable.  In fact, in terms of characterization, I believe \\"In the Beauty of the Lillies\\" is comparable to the Rabbit series, although it loses something with its more diffuse focus.  In other respects, this novel does not measure up to other Updike efforts.  At times Updike goes overboard with descriptive phrases, yet there are fewer of those wonderfully deft analogies/metaphors which always grace his work, such as (from \\"Lillies\\"): \\"a metropolitan surf as incessant as the sea's\\", referring to city noise.  \\"In the Beauty of the Lillies\\" is meant as a novel of social history, but too often the history consists of enumeration of details.  Having said all this, while \\"Lillies\\" is not Updike's best novel, it is still very good.  Warning: some readers may find the first section, about the minister, slower moving than the rest of the novel.	2005-10-05

I don't share his passion, and found some of his case histories neither interesting nor illuminating. There is also a  bit of needless repetition.  I would still very much recommend this book.  Bird migrations are remarkable, and most of us have at least some interest in the habits of the birds around us.  This is a well organized book, and it is built around scientific inquiry, and observation, and the theories that result.  There is still much to be learned, which is both good and bad.  Sometimes there are interesting alternative theories, and sometimes Kerling has to simply point to gaps in knowledge.  The production values are high, ie. the various typesets and illustrations.  While \\"finding the way\\" is the most important chapter from my viewpoint, it turns out there are many other issues related to migration.  Incidentally, in the \\"Finding the Way\\" chapter, there is one important omission: Kerlinger brings up the subject of straight line routes vs. great circle routes, gives evidence that at least sometimes birds use the longer straight line routes, then writes (p.149): \\"Some migrants do seem to use great circle routes, but   ....\\".  What follows the \\"but\\" is off topic, and in fact great circle routes never explicitly come up again.	2005-10-02

This is an account of a dysfunctional family, although I almost hate to use that term despite the suicide of the father (I am not giving anything away) and the schizophrenia of one of the two children.  There is love, strength and humor, and an unforgettable bond between the two siblings. In the beginning, the writing calls attention to itself, but Hornbacher is good enough to carry this off. Each of the main characters narrates  sections of the book in their own voice, and even the several secondary characters come alive.  The sections narrated by the schizophrenic child, Esau, are especially good.  Toward the end, Hornbacher overdoes some small things: Esau scores 3 bingo's (7 letter words) in Scrabble in less than half the game, without using any esoteric words; Frank has a truly incredible library.  This reinforces my suspicions that perhaps, in the account of the mental hospital and its patients, some degree of realism  was sacrificed.  That qualification aside, \\"The Center of Winter\\" credibly deals with mental illness, the terrible impact war has on some of its soldiers and a failed marriage.  It is very well written, entertaining, and despite its subject matter, heartwarming.	2005-09-15

Caputo was with the first marine battalion to deploy to Danang, and what surprised me was that the problems began right from the start:  constant patrols which lead to loss of life without any clear purpose; a strategy which never got past body counts; a gulf between the fighters and the rear echelons, even at the beginning when they were co-located; the infliction of unnecessary civilian casualties out of frustration and fear and rage.<br /><br /> Rumor of War is a simply written narrative account of Caputo's experiences. One almost wishes for more evidence of the novelist he later became.  There are relatively few conversations, and the only personality which really emerges is that of Caputo.  At the same time, Caputo is honest in his self-reflections, is never verbose, and was there.  Possibly, the book would not be as powerful if it were told some other way.  I gave the book 5 stars because its material is so important, and certainly bears on our experiences in Iraq, whatever your views on that war are.	2005-09-12

I learned an awful lot, found lots of clear, insightful writing, but was sometimes frustrated.  <br />  <br />     There are different kinds of neurons, but the primary basis for brain function is the formation and regulation of synapses, which is influenced by genetics, as well as the pre-natal and post-natal environment, including learning.  LeDoux provides a clear understanding of the basic biochemistry of synapses, as well as \\"long term  potentiation\\", and connects the latter to learning and memory.  He then delves into our systems for emotion and motivation, and even provides a point of view on how consciousness comes about. He builds on this so that in the penultimate chapter he is able to discuss what is known about the causes of several psychiatric disorders, and how drugs treat them. <br />    <br />     In the psychiatric drug chapter, the discussion of schizophrenia was clear, the discussion of depression was not.  I believe that this reflects the fact that more is understood about schizophrenia, and that the mechanisms are apparently simpler than for depression.   There are other subjects like depression, e.g. the roles of the hippocampus, where the truth is complex and not currently well understood.  With such subjects, the tendency that LeDoux has to discuss in some detail the historical evolution of our thinking  seems to make things harder to understand rather than simpler, as the reader tries to absorb multiple complex and not fully satisfying ideas.  <br /> <br />     LeDoux is wonderful at explaining just what an experiment or study shows, and what it only suggests and why.  Thus, despite having read a number of previous discussions on the research findings about identical twins raised separately, I still learned a lot on this subject from LeDoux. When LeDoux veers from the concrete, to discussion of terms such as the self and  emotion and motivation, he does not do a particularly good job, and can get repetitious.  What is needed are clear and explicit operational definitions, which are very different from historical definitions and common usage.    <br /> <br />     Unlike some other reviewers, I valued the last 2 chapters, both for what they had to say, and as kind of a review of the previous material.  On the other hand, I suggest the reader can safely skip chapter 1, and then possibly read it at the end.      <br />      <br />     For a less challenging follow up to this book, drawing more on psychology and social psychology, I recommend \\"Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious\\" by Timothy B.Wilson. <br />	2005-09-11

The names have been changed, and now the protagonist's father is a judge rather than a doctor, and she has picked up a younger brother to go with her older brother.  Again her love life is told through a series of inter-related short stories.   Her mother  finally has some personality, but I did not find the mother a successful character.   This book is not nearly as witty or funny as Bank's earlier effort, but that would have been difficult to match.  The protagonist is more vulnerable, and  possibly for that reason, I was more emotionally involved with this novel. Some other aspects of the novel which especially  interested me: death of a friendship which had always been flawed; what it is like to work on the lower rungs of the publishing world.   Do you think Sophie's final relationship will last?  I am not too optimistic.  For one thing, I do not see that Sophie really has gotten much wiser with age.	2005-08-30

It is interesting, but not a page turner.  Unlike many historical novels, it is more informative about economic and social life and attitudes, than about political history. This is great, but a prologue detailing some of the political background would have really helped. (...)  The two protagonists, Elizabeth and the fictional character, Pelagius, are both complex, interesting characters, and while not religious myself, it was refreshing meeting a character like Pelagius, who takes his religion very seriously.   The secondary characters, with the exception of Pelagius' patron and one time owner,  are simply means to move the plot along, or express social attitudes.	2005-08-30

Also, the format is not one I particularly admire:  most chapters can be viewed as self contained short stories, and were initially presented that way in various publications.  This format often works, and it did this time, but it seems to me not to require the same skill that more traditional novel formats do.  Yet, Bank's exceptional wit and humor won me over.  The first story/chapter is the best of all.  The protagonist is only 14, and she has to be the most endearing 14 year old in all of literature.	2005-08-16

While it is written in an informal style, and does offer some self-help recommendations, Wilson is a professor, and the book is, first of all,  a state of the art report on research he and many others have conducted.  Its subject is the higher level mental functioning  which goes on in our unconscious, mostly inaccessible to us.  It turns out that surprisingly much is going on.  We are unaware of this not because we repress it, but as a result of evolution and efficiency.    <br />    The conclusions Wilson reaches as they pertain to \\"self-help\\" is that   deliberate introspection into ones motives and personality is of surprisingly limited value, in fact often misleading.  Instead, one should pay more attention to how you react to things and behave,  how others view you - and to what has been found through research.  <br />    Is Wilson objective?  I believe he is.  In so far as I was already familiar with some of his material, he presents it fairly.  He is cautious in qualifying his statements.  Never-the-less, the reader must be aware that he frequently resorts to anecdotes and literature.  While this is primarily for illustrative purposes,  it is indicative of the fact that there is much more research to be done.  It is  kind of like research into nutrition - while much has been learned, studies are often not as definitive as one would like, and sometimes are reversed.   Occasionally,  Wilson is not careful.   In one experiment, he found that college students who analyzed their date relationships \\"tended to change their attitudes toward their relationship\\" (p.169).  It would be as easy to conclude this showed the value of introspection and analysis, as to reach the conclusions Wilson does, which are quite different (a variant of this study, p. 170, which looked at the students' predictions of the future longevity of their relationships is  more convincing).    While Wilson is aware of neurological research (cf. reference to LeDoux), he does not emphasize it, which may make the book easier to read, but less authoritative. <br /> <br />	2005-08-16

This book, copyrighted in 1976, is a story of \\"twenty-somethings\\" who are floundering.  The economic environment is very challenging, but Charles, the protagonist, actually has a secure government job, although he finds it unfulfilling.  You get to know Charles very well, which is not a total positive, although he is a decent man, a great friend, and a romantic.  Beattie employs two approaches to developing his character.  I loved the dialogue, which was often very funny, although sometimes more repetitious than it need be to sound authentic and get the point across.   I found my  entry into Charles' thoughts frequently dull, and I wonder how much of this book Beattie could have gotten across by just relying on dialogue and some narrative.  There is more to this book than Charles: several other characters make their mark.   In particular Charle's step father is almost pitiful, but really a vulnerable and well meaning person doing the best he can with a situation with no good resolution, the mental illness of his wife.	2005-08-12

Corballis assembles evidence in favor of the theory that sophisticated gestural language (as contrasted to \\"proto-language\\") preceded spoken language.  Certainly, this makes great intuitive sense, since there is a steady increase over time in genus homo in that part of the brain which controls language, whether it be gestural or vocal,  and this preceded the evolution of fine vocal capabilities.  Moreover, it is intuitive that gestures come more naturally, and with use would become more expressive and \\"conventionalized\\".  On the other hand, while tool making became more sophisticated with the Acheulian technology, found in sites as old as 1.4 million years ago, the real flowering of tools, art, religion was more likely around 50,000 years ago, when the capability for fine vocalization already existed, suggesting, as many scientists have concluded,  that there may have been  a major leap forward at that time in speech and conceptualization (cf. Turner, Mark and Gilles Fauconnier: \\"The Way We Think\\").  So how worthwhile is \\"From Hand to Mouth\\"?  Much of the writing is good,  I enjoy Corballis' many wisecracks, and he examines what is known in the  many relevant subject areas.   Although he tries to be fair, he can be sloppy.  While he cites Jared Diamond's \\"Third Chimpanzee\\", he repeats the conclusions some scientist's have drawn from the development of the numerous \\"creole's\\", without mentioning, as Diamond does, the possible flaw in reaching such conclusions.    At other times, he makes assumptions without realizing he is doing so.  Thus, in mammals, right limbs are controlled by the left side of the brain, and visa versa.  This is not an inevitable specialization as Corballis thinks, but may owe more to how evolution frequently works: if designed from scratch, it might be more efficient to have both sets of limbs controlled from the same brain area.  The Corballis chapter on right brain vs left brain suffers very much from lack of reference to the work of a noted neurologist, reported in a great book: ,  \\"Phantoms in the Brain\\" by  Ramachandran.  Incidentally, the role of the FOXP2 gene in speech (see earlier reviewer) is quite controversial. \\"From Hand to Mouth\\" is definitely worthwhile, but a better book on the subject will undoubtedly be written.	2005-08-02

In the second half of the twentieth century the current thinking about dinosaurs completely changed, so that they are now accepted as warm blooded, vigorous alternatives to the mammals, and in fact the ancestors of birds (though not all that bright, whereas birds can be). Bakker was a major player in this change of views,  and offers some fascinating anecdotes on how various experiences led to insights which permitted proper interpretation of the fossil evidence.   The reader comes away not only with an understanding of the dinosaurs, but with many insights into evolution in general, and all the types of reasoning and analysis necessary to glean the truth from fossil evidence.  Bakker has a lively style, giving detail without getting bogged down (well,  I occasionally skimmed a bit, but that is because I have little interest in anatomy).  There are many illustrations, but I was not always happy with them.  Some illustrations serve as hand drawn alternatives to Power Point slides, and are very good.   However, the drawings to illustrate anatomy were often not simplified enough for me to better understand the point.  I do wish Bakker had speculated why, in the world of the dinosaurs, it was the mammals who apparently occupied all the really small ecological niches, comparable to current day mice and squirrels. Also, his final chapter on the demise of the dinosaurs was stimulating, but not as well thought out as the rest of the book.  He points to the development of land bridges (as water levels dropped) which permitted worldwide migration of larger animals, and the consequent extinction of many species which could not compete, and also the spread of  pathogens and parasites.   Interesting, but competition would not eliminate all species, and no arguments are presented as to why small animals, e.g. mammals, would be more likely to survive than large animals (great numbers?).  While this book was published in 1986, I read it based on Richard Dawkin's recent recommendation, and I do not believe it is outdated. <br /> <br />	2005-08-01

As political history it is a chilling account of how corruption in an African country destroys the promise of independence. It brings the face of corruption home to the reader as only fiction can.  The protagonist, Vikram Lall, is a venal man who  transcends time and place - one can picture him as an assistant at Enron.  While focusing on Lall, the novel is rich in characters and relationships, and all the characters are nuanced and credible, including Kenyatta, the real world leader of Kenyan independence.   In fact, it is in the novel's portrayal of Kenyatta, and Lall's fictional boss (at least I couldn't find him on the internet) that  it is most chilling, though these people are not pathological murderers and sadists like Idi Amin of Uganda. The prose is not special, just very good, as Vassanji is equally capable with character, dialogue, natural setting.  The plot is always interesting, and becomes something of a page turner at the end.  The story of Lall's childhood, adolescence and young adulthood is as interesting as the rest.  I feel Vassanji made an error in introducing gun running, it just was not necessary, but that is a small thing and my own opinion.

You never know what delight awaits you next.  It might be a technical topic like a terrific write-up on plate tectonics, in which the image of a roll topped desk is invoked, or it might be some zoological topic which Dawkins finds interesting on its own account (Dawkins' sense of interest and wonder is infectious), and which may be used to illustrate some larger idea.  Thus, the book overcomes its \\"plot\\".  Going backwards in time (as contrasted to forward) does not work very well, nor does the whole emphasis on when the ancestors of various current animals first coincided with our own ancestors.  For one thing, genetic \\"closeness\\" has surprisingly little correlation with any intuitive measure of closeness. Thus \\"trouts are closer cousins to humans than they are to sharks\\". For another, we frequently do not know what these common ancestors were like, and Dawkins does not emphasize speculations.  I think it is much more interesting that birds (really their dinosaur ancestors) and mammals developed warm bloodedness through parallel evolution than how many millions of years ago their ancestors split. Based on Dawkins' recommendation, I am currently almost through reading Robert Bakker's book on dinosaurs; because it focuses on function rather than on DNA, it actually is more informative.   I have heard that Dawkins can be controversial, but he seems to be happy to acknowledge ignorance, or to specify when he is choosing among possible alternatives.  He does seem to be very against \\"punctuated equilibrium\\" without every giving more than a superficial write-up of just what it is he is against.	2005-07-18

My problem is that I cannot take seriously most of the characters or much of the plot. The one part of the novel which really works is the section which takes place in the US,  in which the quality of writing approaches that of the \\"House of Sand and Fog\\": in that section the characters are believable, the plot quietly interesting, the father-son relationship touching.  Had Hosseini made the secondary characters in Afghanistan more nuanced, the theme of one person's shame and redemption would have had more power.  The climactic escape scene from the Taliban read like pulp fiction.  Read Vassanji's \\"The In-Between World of Vikram Lall\\" for a successful novel which achieves everything \\"Kite Runner\\" attempts but fails to do: a social and political novel with good plot and interesting characters which also explores one man's attempt, belatedly, to achieve some measure of redemption.	2005-07-14

This book is awful on two accounts.  It is hastily written, and it isn't very informative. I would expect most readers to be either confused and/or bored, depending on their background (I cannot account for the other reviews).   Rose has several schematics of the brain, but does not actually explain them except in the most cursory way.  Rose emphasizes the interplay between genes and environment where environment must be interpreted in the broadest sense: for the unborn it includes not only the uterine environment but the signals from the other cells constituting the embryonic/fetal complex.  This is fine, but well accepted, at least amongst the scientists I have read.  Rose is impressed with Dimasio's work on consciousness, but he more refers to it than tries to make it clear, just as with his brain schematics.  He raises some interesting questions about evolutionary psychology, but he is so dismissal of the field, that the reader must seek elsewhere for an objective analysis.  Yes, I enjoy reading Richard Dawkins and even Steven Pinker, but I am not writing this review with an axe to grind.	2005-07-06

Certainly, Oz is  trying to understand and come to terms with his childhood, but I think his primary motivation may be even simpler: to better recall his youth and the people who were important to him, for Oz makes clear he does not have an exceptional memory, and that sometimes, like an archaeologist, he is recreating a memory from fragments (and whatever help he can get from other first person accounts of the time). <br /> What made reading this book such a memorable experience? Certainly, Oz is a talented writer.  It is unlikely that someone who is not a novelist could write prose as well, or recreate conversations and scenes as well.  Oz's childhood was eventful, and at least in his hands, his family life is interesting.  Oz offers a feel for a time and place (lower middle class life in Jerusalem in the years 1939-1948) as well as  fascinating stories about his ancestors, particularly on his mother's side.  What  really sets this book apart, however, is Oz's personality itself.  You have to love and admire this man - and enjoy his sense of humor. <br /> \\"A Tale of Love and Darkness\\" could have benefited from better editing.  I would advise the reader to keep in mind that Oz was born in 1939, for the book can be imprecise about  dating events, and some readers might wish to begin by looking at the family picture on p.509.   <br />	2005-07-04

I found this novel somewhat lacking:  the plot is rather contrived, and the only well developed secondary character is Zeke's mother. Yet the novel most definitely has its redeeming features.  Livesey writes well, so there are many nicely written scenes. Zeke, the main character, is wonderfully likable, and different.  He  suffers from Asperger syndrome (a mild form of autism), which requires him to be analytical about social skills that most master intuitively (such as interpreting expressions). Yet the Asperger does not define him, so one does not feel he is some kind of archetype.   He is honest and caring, but also able to balance his needs against those of other people.   \\"Banishing Verona\\" is a nice read, but if you have not read Livesey before, my recommendation would be to start with \\"The Missing World\\".	2005-06-14

While he wouldn't provoke a fight, he won't back down from one, no matter the cost.  He happens to be from the South, but moves to Montana, depicted as a land of great beauty, but under the thumb of companies destroying the environment. The novel and character grew on me: while manly, he is also reflective, and a musician to boot.  Burke relies on very fine detail, more than metaphor and analogy, to get his descriptions across.  Perhaps because the closest I normally get to Western literature is Larry McMurtry, but I felt this book really expanded my horizons with its insight into an important sub-culture	2005-06-10

Climate is a confusing subject,  but I think Macdougall could have done better.  There are really two parts to \\"Frozen Earth\\": an historical account of the evolution of scientific thought about ice ages, and an attempt to make sense of the explosion of recent findings and theories, and their implications.  The history makes for surprisingly good reading, and the few scientists Macdougall dwells on led really interesting lives.  Macdougall has a gift for narrative, and for historical context.  It is his organizational skills that leave something to be desired.  Two examples.  It is only in the final chapter, on \\"Ice Ages and the Future\\", that Macdougall explains how weathering of rocks has a long term effect on carbon dioxide in the air (recall that the calcium released ends up bound to carbon in the shells of small sea animals).  Yet weathering is cited, without explanation, several times earlier as if the implications were obvious and even the account finally given is not as clear as it could be.  In that same last chapter, Macdougall reminds the reader, once again, that the \\"Earth is still in an ice age\\".  Yet in the previous chapter Macdougall says about the \\"Little Ice Age\\" of the 14th-19th centuries that the phrase \\"is a misnomer in technical terms, because it was far from being an ice age\\".  Had Macdougall given a few precise  definitions, and been careful how he used the terms subsequently, much confusion would have been avoided.  I guess it spoils a good story that the variations in the earth's orbit do not account for ice ages, but SEEM to contribute to the LONGER range cycles in the retreat and advance of glaciers within ice ages. It sure would have been less confusing if Macdougall had more sharply made this point earlier in the book.	2005-05-25
US	49344980	RS8NTD9XD0VI1	067089995X	881540755	Coal Run	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Heavy subjects, light book.	I loved this book.  The prologue about a mine disaster is a terrific piece of writing.  The novel itself has such themes as the emotional pull of even a depressed small town, and the difficulties of adjustment, whether it be to Viet Nam experiences or a career ending accident or loss of income.  Yet it is a \\"light\\", rather than a heavy novel.  There is lots of humor, and it is peopled by characters who are warm, loving and smart, even if they often act dumb, and even if their entire lives seem so dictated by their high school experiences (the novel catches up with them in middle age).  O'Dell's writing is witty, and her forte is her gift for dialogue.  She is able to convey a strong sense of place.  I understand from other Amazon reviewers that \\"Coal Run\\" is a sequel, but none of the allusions to the past was confusing.  My only reservation about giving it 5 stars is that I felt that with some of her characters O'Dell sacrificed a bit of credibility:  I am thinking of the sister and the police chief and even the young doctor.  Great characters, especially the sister, but maybe heightened for effect.	2005-05-20

This is a remarkable book on the biology of the human cell in that it goes into a level of detail you would expect only in a textbook  - without boring or confusing the reader, and in a relatively short book.  How does Rensberger pull this off?  Certainly with logical organization and clear writing, but there is more to it.  He eliminates all but a whiff of  organic chemistry.  He takes advantage of the fact that evolution so often utilizes existing molecules and pathways to do new things: if you ignore some of the minor chemical modifications, one description covers many different processes.  Most human cells can function on their own in a cell culture; a recurrent theme of the book is that human cells retain most of the capabilities of their free living ancestors, yet are coordinated into a single effective organism.  From previous reading, I do know that Rensberger omitted some very interesting material on the learning and sensory capabilities of individual cells; e.g. many all over the body are sensitive to light.  This topic would have benefited from his talent, and if necessary there is other material which could have been omitted.  Development of the embryo is certainly interesting, but I don't quite see how it fits in with the rest of the book (as contrasted to cell reproduction);  also, perhaps there was a little too much on molecular motors.  The field of cellular biology is very dynamic, and Rennsberger gives the reader a good historical perspective, historical being like 20 years, to better appreciate what we now know.  While theoretically this book requires no background, I would suggest it only for readers who already have some superficial knowledge of DNA and genetics - and who are truly interested in the subject area.	2005-05-18

Before I had a chance to write this review, I read \\"Coal Run\\" by Tawni O'Dell, which has many parallels to Osprey Island (both themes and characters), but is a better book.  In particular, one weakness of \\"Osprey Island\\" is in its treatment of  a major theme, i.e. the inability of many of its younger inhabitants to tear themselves away and seek more opportunity elsewhere.  Attachment to community is painted as entirely a negative emotion, and none of the important characters is  successfully integrated into community life.  The strength of the novel is in its portrayal of the villain and his son.  The villain is a sadistic bully, but his own torments and humanity are such that he is an interesting character.  Thisbe doesn't try to do too much with the boy, just enough so he comes across as very much an individual. There are a few other successful characters, the plot and subplots are interesting enough, and the story's setting on an island which is a summer resort is a big plus. In fact, one of the best secondary characters is an Irish girl there to work for the summer, for fun as well as money.	2005-05-13

Then the lover suffers a  stroke, inducing partial amnesia, so that she forgets the years in which their relationship soured; the egoist attempts to take advantage of this, caring for her and resuming the relationship.  Not only does Livesey make this plot entirely credible, she references various books on memory at the end.  \\"The Missing World\\" is both a big book and a small book.  Small in that it focus on the post-stroke relationship in detail as it unfolds.  Big in that there are many characters, and several sub-plots.  I loved  both aspects of the novel, and all the characters (well, maybe not the friend). The egoist is definitely evil, but  it is easy to understand why women might love him, and he is even contextually compassionate, i.e. on his job as a claims adjuster.  \\"The Missing World\\" is often fun, insightful in its treatment of egoism, understanding in its treatment of depression.  One of  Livesey's concerns, as it was in her earlier work, \\"Criminals\\", was what we owe to other people, whether they be close relatives or little more than acquaintances. I had mixed feelings about how the American fares at the end, but that may just be my disappointment he does not end up better, as he deserves.	2005-05-13

As other reviewers have pointed out, most of this book is not about the elephants themselves.  I knew this going in, but as I enjoyed looking at history from the perspective of salt (Mark Kurlansky, \\"Salt\\"), I was hoping I would enjoy \\"Elephant Destiny\\" more than I did.  The chapters on the elephants are toward the end (chapters 18-22), and are fascinating: it would be hard for them not to be, the social life of elephants is so interesting.  For those of you who are not going to read this book, or parts of it, the two main researchers into elephant behavior are apparently Cynthia Moss and Joyce Poole, and Katy Payne has a book on elephant communication.  Meredith mentions elephants swimming across rivers.  Fossils of pygmy elephants have been found on some Asian islands, and it is speculated their ancestors actually swam to the islands.	2005-04-26

As she is a mother of an 8 year old, this is a particular problem.  It is a \\"worthwhile\\" novel, because it does teach patience with those who may also take a long time coming to terms with a devastating event.  Possibly it will be the reader who requires that patience at some point, and possibly memories of this book will permit himself/herself not to feel too guilty. However, I did not find the widow very likeable, even allowing for her grief.  My real problem with the book is its style.  The prose is plodding, with only occasional touches of grace or wit.  The ending is very good, but marred by a story of a Viet Nam atrocity while is almost unbelievable, and certainly unnecessary overkill for this particular novel; a less extreme incident would have sufficed.  Still, there is some wry humor  revolving around the woman's friend, and the novel is well plotted in a quiet way.	2005-03-25

Genghis Khan tells the story of the great Mongol leader and his successors. Weatherford is interested in the Mongol culture, morality, impact on history.  He draws on an \\"official\\" Mongol source, as well as reports of contemporaries in other societies.  The Mongols were true internationalists and  effective rulers, as well as religiously tolerant, and progressive.  They were innovators in military tactics, politics and economics, and they valued talent and skill of all kinds, wherever they could find it.  While ruthless, the Mongols did not  slaughter without some objective, nor were they torturers.   Unfortunately, revenge was very important to them, and the Mongols were quick to feel agrieved.  While Weatherford is sympathetic to the Mongols, and interested in correcting  the historical distortions  which arose many years AFTER the Mongol period of domination, he seems to be trying to be objective.  The book is fast paced, and provides wonderful insight into an important  century of world history.  One warning:  much of the book does concern itself with military campaigns and dynastic politics, so if you do not care for that kind of conventional history, this book may not be for you, despite its broader reach.  Also, I question whether the Mongol period was as important to the beginning of  the European Renaissance as Weatherford seems to think:  after all, there were already Genoese trading outposts in the Seljurk Turk world, and much has been written of the importance of the 2 centuries before the Renaissance, in Europe, to what happened thereafter.	2005-03-22

Johnson is a remarkable popular science writer, with a talent for language and metaphor comparable to that of  a very good novelist.  He is also very bright, objective, personable and does his research well.  Even when I was familiar with a particular subject area,  I learned a lot or understood things better.   While my background is better than some, this is a book accessible to all.  Johnson's objective for \\"Mind Wide Open\\" is to help the reader live a better life by providing the kind of understanding that leads to more aware self-examination - not the usual kind of objective for a popular science work.  I believe this objective, as well as Johnson's own enthusiasms, may have led him a little astray.  The chapters I liked least were on bio-feedback (Johnson is on the board of a bio-feedback company, as I learned from one of his footnotes), and functional brain imaging.  Both chapters centered on Johnson's personal experiences, not as a way to explain science, as elsewhere, but as some kind of personal adventure which is supposed to demonstrate the potential of these tools for generating self-awareness.  The rest of the book is so interesting, I really begrudge the loss of what could have been in 2 additional chapters.  Mind Wide Open is particularly strong in its discussion of  memory and emotions (fear, love) and on the role of the body's owns drugs, which cocaine and the like mimic.  As part of his summing up, Johnson has a wonderful discussion of how Freud can be updated to provide a modern theory of psychology.	2005-03-08

The writing was competent enough, but I found it a bit pretentious when it tried to be important.  Then, I changed my mind.  It is a very uplifting story of two elderly people who are able, as septuagenarians, to grow through self discovery.  One of them meets the kind of end most of us would like to meet, with acceptance and dignity, amidst loved ones.  I found this book especially heartening as a senior citizen (and as a recent reader of  Wallace Stegner's \\"Spectator Bird\\" in which the elderly character views himself as being in a line, getting ever closer to the end as friends in front die).   \\"School for the Blind\\" is warm and humorous.

Community life is not important to the novel, whereas individuals and family and the experience of nature and spirit are. While not long, \\"Love Medicine\\" follows many characters over many years, doing so by moving between time and character in each chapter,  in a non-linear fashion.  I understand the new edition of \\"Love Medicine\\" has 5 additional chapters, and a genealogy in the beginning.  If you have the old version, make sure you construct your own genealogy as you work through the novel, in order to keep everyone straight.  Love Medicine is definitely not a \\"feel good\\" novel, but I really wish Erdrich had not introduced King in the second chapter.  He made that chapter on the family reunion more disheartening than it should have been, given the future development of the novel, as well as the reader's enjoyment.	2005-02-28

A happily married couple is living out a very comfortable, uneventful retirement.  Occasioned by a postcard from a woman they met on an extended trip to Denmark, they re-read the husband's diary of the trip.  He had been tempted by the Danish woman, who is the heroine of what can only be described as a Gothic tale, one the couple briefly became involved in.  As you might expect from Stegner, much of the writing is  good, although there is one scene (midnight on the lake), when the similes come so fast, it is almost a parody.  The Gothic tale is engrossing.  Yet, for me the novel was something of a failure.  As a senior citizen I can appreciate the validity of Stegner's portrayal of  the challenges and rewards of retirement and a good marriage, but I found the portrayal lifeless for the most part.	2005-02-28

This book is an extended essay on the proper role of pictures of suffering, and what constitutes a moral way to react to such pictures.  Sontag touches on a number of other issues along the way, as well as providing an historical perspective.   In fact, Sontag sees such pictures as in the tradition of religious paintings and sculptures which graphically have depicted suffering, in Christianity and in pagan myths.  Sontag does not reach many definite conclusions, and those pretty much in the last 2 short chapters, but looks at each issue as objectively as she can.  While there was much interesting material, the book, short as it is, is organized much too loosely for my taste, and is even repetitious, so that I often found myself skimming.	2005-02-04

It is written for the non-mathematicians, and in fact does a very good job of giving the reader insight into how the mathematical modeler thinks and works, and what mathematical modeling is (the phrase \\"dynamic linear graphs\\" does not actually appear in the text).  \\"Linked\\" is kind of an intellectual memoir, and especially in the first few chapters, is charming as well as informative.  The problem is that Barabasi has an inflated view of the importance and primacy of his work and interests vis-a-vis the general subject of the theory of complex systems.  Also, while Barbasi strikes me as intellectually honest, his lack of knowledge of such subjects as cellular biology leads him to  erroneous claims for what insights may be attributed to recent work in network modeling. He is on stronger grounds when he discusses narrow subjects such as the links between corporate directors, and Barabasi does seem to know quite a bit about sociological modeling and the Internet.  In terms of intellectual stimulation and excitement, Linked does not begin to match up with Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software by Steven Johnson,  and I guess I was expecting something more comparable to that book.	2005-01-24

This may be the best written science book I have ever read.  It has all the qualities of good science writing:  it is carefully organized;  it has an implicit model of what the reader will be able to comprehend, and warns the reader when some material is perhaps too difficult, as well as making good use of footnotes; it fairly discusses issues which have not been settled, making clear where the author stands; it is up to date; it has a sense of humor and a lively style.  What makes this book absolutely stand out, is its brilliant use of metaphor and image, both word images and illustrations.  Having said all that, I am not particularly motivated to read other books in the same subject area:  while Greene provides the reader with a real feel for the material, the understanding is necessarily superficial. In fact, I was happier with the latter, more exotic,  part of the book than with the earlier more familiar material about relativity: Greene even got me comfortable with 4 and more dimensions of space.   And it was nice to read, for my sanity, that all forces are implemented via actual movement of particles of force, be it photons or gravitrons (which Greene is certain exist and will be observed as our tools get better, and he is not prone to being dogmatic). One warning: for some reason, Green unaccountably delays mentioning that the probability concept used by quantum physicists does not really track conventional interpretations, wherein probabilities, being non-zero, cannot cancel each other.	2005-01-21

In so far as the three different novellas which comprise \\"Wives & Lovers\\"  are about any one thing, it is that experience.   The longest of the 3 novellas, \\"Rare & Endangered Species\\", is by far the most satisfying.  Bausch does not have anything novel or brilliant or terribly witty to say, and his characters are not novel or brilliant or terribly witty, but Bausch makes fine art out of the ordinary.  In \\"Rare and Endangered Species\\", Bausch expands the cast of characters beyond the families of immediate interest.  He achieves some of the effect of those novels which depict the intertwining lives of a small town, and it certainly makes for good reading, but it does not seem quite developed.   In shorter works I sometimes am too aware of the author at work, the characters do not take over the writing, and I felt this way about the two other novellas. The construction of the first novella is interesting:  it climaxes, quietly, with an event (the grandmother's death) that occurs in the middle of the few weeks depicted.  In the third novella, the motel owner, a totally ordinary women whose ex-husband turns out to be a serial killer, is the one character who is sympathetic.	2005-01-11

Didion's heroine reminds one of several of her other heroines, coming from a background where she is expected to be an adornment and where the strains of playing that role take a psychological toll.  In Democracy,  the heroine is psychologically stronger than in some of the other novels,  plays on a larger canvas, and is ultimately able to more successfully express her inner strengths and  morality.  Interestingly, Didion injects herself into the novel as the narrator, and yes, Didion did work briefly at Vogue, and of course was both a reporter and a novelist.  My guess is that the conceit of starting to write one novel, and ultimately writing a different one, was probably accurate.	2004-12-30

Fauconnier and Turner argue that in the recent human past, e.g. 50,000 years ago, humans developed the capability to think in new ways, what they call double scope blending.  This then led to both a cultural explosion, and speech.  In writing a book like this, the authors face a dilemma: in arguing for their theories they would like to show the weaknesses of competing theories, but if they are writing for the general reader, this may mean devoting lots of time to first explaining the competitive theories.  In discussing the origins of speech, they were able to accomplish this reasonably well, but elsewhere the book had brief allusions to other theories which I found of little value, as a layman reader  The authors mostly do a nice job illustrating their concepts, although some of the examples do require some math background, and one small example even requires a knowledge of French (no interpretation given), and this all could have been avoided.  My major problem with the book is that I think the authors are trying to make more of their ideas than is really there:  what they have shown is that blending seems to be ONE insightful way of imaging how higher level thought proceeds.  Had they been content with this, and less breathless in their account, they could have written a shorter, more focused, better book.  Nor have they convinced me that primitive speech, based on the \\"simplex\\" network, using their terminology, wouldn't have been useful, and not required the capability to do double scope blending: thus speech could have evolved more slowly, along with the capability of physically making a variety of sounds, and mental capacities.  Furthermore, the authors seems to look at the historical record and see what they want to, stating points of view as facts: for example, I believe there are still reputable scientists who believe that the Neanderthals might have had religious/artistic capabilities.	2004-12-21

Not a very promising subject for a novel, and in fact, the early part of the novel is unappealing.  Then Bailey works his magic.  Gabriel's Lament is filled with characters, mostly misfits, as is the protagonist, really, who are full of life.    Most notable is Gabriel's father, kind of an Archie Bunker type.  The conflict and tension between Gabriel and his father gives substance to this work. As in two other Bailey novels which I have read, the story is told looking back, but it is mostly linear in time, and does not display the technical virtuosity of \\"Kitty and Virgil\\": for new Bailey readers, I would recommend that work first.	2004-12-21

After reading Bailey's \\"Kitty and Virgil\\" and \\"Gabriel's Lament\\", I found this novel a total disappointment.   I suppose it was intended to be charming and sad.

Kitty leads a quiet life, yet is still something of a free spirit.  Virgil has escaped from Communist Romania, and despite his  fame in Romania as a poet, does manual work in England.  For the first several chapters, I found the protagonists very likeable, but the novel amusing at best. As the story unfolds, the love story deepens and becomes more emotionally compelling.  Bailey frequently switches between scenes from Virgil's childhood, Kitty's childhood,  their time together, visits with Kitty's family, and Virgil's Romanian past as a persecuted poet.  Bailey demonstrates technical brilliance in his handling of these changes of scene.  The secondary characters are all well drawn and interesting in their own right, as is the depiction of Romanian political life under the deranged dictator Ceausescu.  The novel is suffused with warm and quirky humor as well as deep sadness.  I did have some problem with the ending (stop here if you have not read the book).  The extended epilogue wherein Kitty tries to learn more of Virgil and meets his friends and family, balancing this against his long farewell letter, was moving and engrossing.  What bothers me is that Virgil ascribes his setback in the battle against guilt and  depression to the time he had the flu.  It makes more sense to me to ascribe it to the release of the dictator's overthrow, which may be logically paradoxical, but makes psychological sense to me,  squares better with the timeline of events, and better balances cause and effect.	2004-12-14

Yet in some ways this is a disappointing effort.  In particular, the middle of the book is kind of dull, almost repetitious.  Once Meyer's term approaches the turbulent economic times which culminate in the bursting of the equities bubble, the book becomes interesting again.  Meyer has a gift for explaining economics, and he has a wonderful personality, the type of person you would like to have as a friend: he clearly enjoys life, is warm, positive about other people, modest, truthful, objective.  Perhaps the problem is that it just isn't very interesting being a Fed governor.  Or it may be that the book is too focused.  For example, the productivity acceleration that Greenspan was sure was taking place took a long time to be reflected in the economic statistics, but once it was, it was also determined that the historical statistics had been significantly wrong!  Meyer had nothing to say about these errors, other than to note them.  Meyer also had much too little to say, to my mind, about why the Federal Reserve did not adjust margin requirements when it thought there was probably an equity bubble.  Read this book, but do not hesitate to skip some of the chapters.	2004-11-29

While Herman is faithful to his theme, too faithful as I will explain, I view his work as a really fine history book, one written across academic boundaries:  it covers the political, economic, social, intellectual, literary and architectural history of Scotland, focusing on the 18th century.   It is written largely in terms of personalities; while at times the reader may get overwhelmed by a parade of characters, this is relatively infrequent.  Instead,  Herman always focuses on those elements of a person's background and accomplishment which reflect his society and contributed to it.  Edinburgh in the 18th century reminds one of Athens in the 5th century BC., with all these intellectual greats knowing each other well, and all benefiting from  and creating  new ways of looking at the world.  Sometime in the 19th century, Scotland went into decline.  While Herman  is very talented at briefly capturing the essence of social or economic changes, he has very little to say about the causes of this decline: it is almost as if it does not square with his themes.   In the beginning of the book, Herman left my head swimming with his too short a discussion of earlier Scotch history, but maybe he assumed more knowledge on the reader's part than I had.  In any event, after using the term Jacobite numerous times, he finally explains it on p.114 (hint, it has nothing to do with  the Jacobins of the French revolution).	2004-11-19

Samuel Tyne is  a novel with multiple themes, from the cultural conflicts of  an African couple settling in an Alberta town, to the blight of dealing with psychotic children.  Esi seems to delight in making situations just a little bleaker than they might be in real life: thus Samuel, while working for the Canadian government, has a father-son set of bosses who are bizarre without being in any way humorous.  Sometimes the novel is very alive and engrossing, mostly it is bleak and unrewarding.  The two most interesting and well drawn characters are secondary characters:  the Tyne's white \\"friends\\" in their small town.  Incidentally, there is nothing mysterious about the ending, as a reviewer wrote, it is quite clear who committed the crime.	2004-11-17

In an earlier work Margulis, who is a distinguished scientist, recounted her struggles in getting a theory accepted which is now part of the orthodoxy: that the mitochondria and chloroplast organelles originated as separate organisms.   Chapters 9-13 of Acquiring Genomes discuss more recent findings by her and others which point to the importance of saltatory (sudden) changes as contrasted to gradual evolution. In particular, there is evidence that radically different marine species, from different phyla, can very occasionally successfully mate, and that this may be the basis for the larval stages in so many animals. There is even more evidence that in one event, all the chromosomes in an animal can break in half without destroying the viability of the animal or its ability to mate with \\"normal\\" members of the species - although it is not discussed how exactly this leads to change.   There is additional insight into how the nucleated cell was first formed.  Unfortunately, Margulis did not have a collaborator who had the patience to expand on these chapters, providing more background, and making them more accessible to the layman. Chapters 1-8 of Acquiring Genomes should be SKIPPED, which means that if the reader does not have some comfort with Margulis' original ideas, the whole book should be skipped.  These first chapters are bombastic, argumentative, repetitive, inaccurate, and have relatively little information of value. One idea I did get from these chapters (which I skimmed, not being a masochist) is that, in a sense, all bacteria are members of one species, since they all can interchange genes.  Also, some bacterial symbionts are actually inherited, in that they are present in the egg or sperm, while not yet in the nucleus. <br />  <br />	2004-11-09

Its protagonist, Charleen Forrest, is the sister of the suburban Mom and biographer/novelist who is the protagonist of two other Shields novels.  Shields herself was  a biographer/novelist and suburban mom. Shields is in top form in the Box Garden, piling on beautiful, original, totally apt metaphors, while capturing family scenes with economy and humor.  Not only the biographer, but her husband and children show up in the Box Garden, and it would be a great first read for the lucky individual who is new to Carol Shields.  In fact, I found the biographer's husband more alive in the Box Garden than in the other Shield's novels.  Charleen is a woman with a teenage son who has yet to  recover from her divorce of many years, a divorce which was not bitter, but entailed a great sense of loss and disillusionment.   Charleen's mother, a totally repressed individual, is a great character, as well as the mother's new fiancee.   The plot has something of a bizarre, but credible  twist.  My only complaint:  Charleen's son is a little too well adjusted.	2004-10-20

Reality and Dreams reminds me of some of the Faye Weldon novels:  it has an edge, and characters who are full of life, but  not fully realized.  If it is a satire, it is more a satire of human nature than of specific cultural norms, although it does reflect a Britain where the social net has frayed.  Reality and Dreams is quite readable and sometimes fun,  but it is lightweight, and not all that amusing.	2004-10-20

The love affair is really a threesome, involving the girl's dying brother, and the relationship between the siblings is beautiful. There are a number of other important and interesting plot elements,  but for me it is the writing that makes this book very enjoyable.  What is remarkable about this is that The Great Fire abounds with passages I re-read several times without understanding, nor does Hazzard have the type of eye and wit of say an Updike.  Reading The Great Fire is a little like reading one of the great essayists, who is always trying to capture subtleties of thought and feeling, and who thereby conveys a love of prose to the reader. As one reviewer put it, The Great Fire is both cerebral and ethereal. A minor point: Hazzard is annoyingly slow in conveying some details of Leith`s background in the beginning, such as exactly what he is doing in Japan.	2004-10-01

In an ingenious plot device, the woman, as a favor to a friend, converses with the friend's depressed and shy father, using a screen to separate them visually, kind of like a psychiatrist's couch.  This turns into something of a career,  but also echoes the writings of a famous medieval Japanese woman author, at a time when noblewomen led secluded lives.  The love of beauty unites the two women, and is an important element in both historic periods, however unsatisfactory other aspects of the periods are.  Now Blensdorf had lived in Japan only 2 years when she wrote this book, and I cannot vouch for the accuracy of some of her commentaries on modern Japanese life; certainly, she isn't very artful or subtle in conveying them.  Nor is Sei Shonagon's general plot line very artful or subtle.  What Blensdorf does remarkably well is to make the reader experience the  woman's love of beauty, and its powers of sustenance.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-01

It is the story of a college professor/author, Grady Tripp, with great talent who has been struggling for years with an ultimately unsuccessful novel (as did Chabon himself), and an unsuccessful marriage.  Tripp's relationships with the women in his life are moving and funny and sad and outrageous, but unfortunately they comprise only part of the this too long novel.  Whereas in Mysteries of Pittsburgh the drugs and alcohol were in the background, the reader of Wonder Boys is dragged through pages that could be of interest only to someone a little drunk himself.  Whereas Mysteries of Pittsburgh was written with a light touch, Wonder Boys often seems to be trying too hard: a case in point is the transvestite character who appears in the beginning of the book and disappears, with no apparent purpose as far as I could see. <br /> <br />	2004-09-19

Linguistics is the science of language, and psycho-linguistics is a branch of psychology attempting to understand how we acquire and process language, both oral and written.      While this is a book about psycho-linguistics, it provides the reader with the necessary background in  the relevant areas of linguistics.  Psycholinguistics utilizes a variety of inputs:  some very clever experimental tools, both high tech and low tech; studies of individuals with brain damage of some kind; computer investigations of artificial intelligence.  Most amazing are the experiments with infants only a few days old.  Gerry writes very clearly, and employs just enough repetition to reinforce ideas without being boring.  Notwithstanding his efforts, and the significant progress that has been made, psycholinguistics at this point still seems to be more a collection of intriguing conclusions and experiments than a coherent whole. A previous reviewer mentioned that his Tower of Babel  analogy adds nothing, and I quickly learned to skip his references to the Tower, but this is a very minor point.  I found some of the sentences Gerry used for illustrating points more convoluted than I would have liked, but perhaps that was necessary.  I had always thought I would be interested in linguistics, but while the book's discussions of linguistics were interesting, especially on the differences between languages,  Gerry left me with no great desire to read another book on the subject, which was a disappointment. In summary, a very good book, but written in 1997, so perhaps a more recent book would be better.	2004-09-12

This book is most appreciated, I believe, if you do not know much about it, so I will be careful.  It is the story of Art Bechstein's  summer after college graduation, a summer of maturation and change.  It is also the story of his friends, people who think of themselves as very special and important,  and Chabon enables the reader to think so as well - one reviewer's comparison to Fitzgerald is apt.  There is a lot of drinking, sex and soft drugs, but these activities are there only as part of the narrative flow: the focus is on the characters and their relationships.  The characters often have fun, and so does the reader.  Chabon has a scriptwriter's talents for scenes and dialogue (he did receive writing credits for the script of Wonder Boys, based on his second novel), and a sprightly, inventive prose style.  Mysteries of Pittsburgh is written with a delightful, light touch, while not shying away from the unpleasant. Having said all this, I cannot fully explain why I liked this novel so much.	2004-09-12

To be a paleontologist  these days you need to know more than a little about biology, molecular biology, physics, chemistry, geology, plate tectonics, climatology, fossils of course - and be something of an adventurer.  Knoll is also a fine writer - clear, interesting, capable of good descriptive prose.  Truthfully, I am not all that interested in fossils, and I didn't get much from the color pictures, although others may.  The quality of the writing got  me through many of these sections.  My reward was the many state of the art discussions, such as: the role of combined organisms in evolution:  the genesis of the explosion of life forms which has occurred several times in earth's history; the origin of earth's current atmosphere (yes, that is important to reading the fossil clues).  Knoll is great at identifying issues, explaining why some theories are no longer tenable, giving the arguments for the rest, and explaining his hunches.  We all know that current levels of oxygen are due to photosynthesis, but it is not so simple, because if that were all there were to it, the earth would have had a high oxygen atmosphere hundreds of millions of years before it did.   If you are interested in global warming, get this book, and just read the relevant chapters.  Knoll cannot give background in all the subject areas, so he does not try for any.  I would have been happier if I knew more about some of the bacteria he discusses, and an introductory chapter on what constitutes a fossil would have saved me some time (the material is there).  However, if you know something about RNA/DNA, and have read at least one good article on plate tectonics, I think you will be OK. <br /> <br />	2004-09-02

The first part of the book, focusing on the parents, is primarily a social novel.  The second part, focusing on the son, but the mother also to some extent, is more a novel of character.  I learned something from the first part, and enjoyed the second part, but overall I would have to say this book was quite ordinary, as contrasted to Lahiri's earlier effort, Interpreter of Maladies.  The son, although  liberated culturally, is rather a repressed personality, and Jumpa manages to make him interesting primarily through his sequence of lovers.  The Namesake was the second novel I have read this year in which a young man moves in with his lover AND her well to do parents, and they become something of a foursome (no, not sexually; the other novel was Russian Debutante's Daughter).	2004-08-14

It is a simply written, absorbing account of one man's experience of the Holocaust.    The man, David Gordon,  must maintain control of his emotions, despite his intense anger, and controlled emotion is the tone of this novel (which is broken up into two novellas and packaged with a short non-fiction account).  David Gordon must deny his previous identity, psychological as well as biographical, to survive.  Grabowski builds on this so that Gordon is sometimes talking to and actively suppressing his former personality.  It is a frequently effective literary device, but perhaps a bit overdone.	2004-08-14

Let me acknowledge that I personally struggle to outgrow the \\"formal-reflexive\\"  stage of consciousness and  to feel comfortable in the \\"vision-logic\\" stage, and perhaps for that reason I stopped reading A Brief History of Everything after chapter 11.  For me,  Wilber's effort is  a fine account and synthesis of many contemporary philosophical, psychological, cultural ideas, written in a clear, informal style, which often succeeds brilliantly in simplifying without oversimplifying.   I finally truly understand post-modernism, and deconstuctionism.  By relating and organizing the contributions of many thinkers, Wilber attempts to create new truths as well as express old ones, and I suspect he has accomplished this with his account of the different psychiatric approaches.  At the same time, well before chapter 12, there were sections I did not get much out of.  Also, Wilber makes two important errors in the first chapter of the book: evolutionists have several competing ideas for the origin of life which do not rely on impossibly random events (cf. Stuart Kauffman: At Home In the Universe: the Search for Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity ),  as well as explanations of the functions of  pre-flight wing-like appendages.  They have begun to identify in the fossil record some of the intermediate stages, and it would be surprising if life is not created in the test tube by the end of the century by \\"fair\\" means, and in fact there is not the great divide between non-life and life that Wilber posits.	2004-08-14

Most of the book consists of Gilmore's summary of anthropological studies of \\"primitive\\" cultures, and these accounts are reasonably interesting in themselves, and good background for readers interested in subjects like evolutionary psychology. I respect the author as being objective.  I also accept his conclusion, that most of the traditional values associated with manhood had their genesis in the needs of society, e.g. for protection.  I presume he writes about the Mediterranean ideals of machismo (in one of the less interesting chapters) rather than Middle Eastern ideals because he was more comfortable with them, but it does not take a feminist to believe some of the concepts of manhood  were used to oppress women.  Gilmore does not sufficiently distinguish between the origin of values, and their functionality within changed environments, or between the core values and their subsequent distortion.  Most provocative were the two studies of cultures in which all the \\"normal\\" concepts of manhood are lacking: does this really show there is no genetic basis for gender differences, or that neither genetics or environment by itself determines behavior?	2004-08-09

Elizabeth Costello is an aging novelist who embarks on a series of speaking engagements, each occasioning a different discussion from animal rights to the African novel; and as in a picaresque novel, she attempts to best (intellectual) adversaries.  In the last chapter, she is apparently dead, and must answer to a heavenly tribunal.   The book is literary and philosophical, not at all the type of book which I would expect to greatly appeal to me.  And certainly, I don't think I  learned  very much.  However, the writing is so good that Elizabeth Costello is a  delight.  And there is even some laugh out loud humor, particularly in the chapter where Elizabeth has a speaking engagement at the college where her son teaches. At the same time,  Costello is hardly the most engaging character. The focus of her reflections on  life is on whether novel writing is meaningful.  It is telling that when she visits with her son, the chapters are told from his viewpoint.	2004-07-19

This is a remarkable book, despite some flaws.  In a fast paced, informal, conversational voice, von Hippel presents an incredible amount of information, most of it very interesting.  The emphasis is on physiology, not anatomy, and it is grounded in evolutionary concepts.  Thus, while things work remarkably well, designs are certainly not what you would get starting from scratch - although  Hippel sometimes shows that there are so many conflicting constraints that many apparently simpler designs would not work.  Hippel, a doctor, is interested in clinical problems and treatments, as well as evolution and how things work in other life forms.  He is also the type of scientist who draws scientific lessons from the most mundane phenomenon of everyday life.   I personally enjoyed his sense of humor and crusty manner, although you might not if you are a lawyer or politician.  The problem with the book is that while Hippel explains things clearly enough, there is a limit to how well you can convey material without the graphical aids found in good textbooks, nor is Hippel that clear in his own mind about just what kind of background he expects his readers to have.  I tended to enjoy most of  the sections I was not fully following: I would read quickly and pick up interesting nuggets.  Still, readers without any background in molecular biology are likely to miss a lot and may have  difficulty with the first few chapters.	2004-07-19

This is a fictionalized account of Archimedes, at the time he first gained employment building war machines for his native Syracuse.  As a self absorbed, yet benevolent genius, he is kind of fun.  His slave/companion is an interesting, even credible character, and Sand Reckoner provides insights into the politics as well as the science of the day - in particular what it meant to be a neighbor of Rome.  On the other hand the  romance is juvenile, and most of the characters are stick figures, to the extent that I could not enjoy the novel sufficiently as even light fiction.  Sand Reckoner is a very ordinary example of  historical fiction.  By way of comparison, I am currently reading Jackson by Max Byrd, which actually has literary merit.	2004-07-16

What do you say about the devastating disappearance of a beloved young daughter?  Brockmeier imagines a fictional writer who eventually recovers sufficiently to write this book, a wonderful combination of narrative, stories, and musings.   You feel the pain and sadness without being overwhelmed by it.  The writer's wife is not as completely devastated, perhaps because she was not as involved with the disappearance.  Her life, and their marriage, is sketched with a light touch  which yet manages to capture so much.  If John Irving had a lighter touch, and had lost a child, I could imagine him writing this book.  For those readers who found the book at all confusing, I suggest they reread, carefully, the forward by the fictional novelist (this helped me).	2004-06-23

Matte is a recently divorced woman with two young children who slowly recreates a fulfilling life.  While told in the 3rd person, Blue Shoe is written entirely from Matte's viewpoint: I suspect this is simpler than using the first person, but perhaps not as effective. To my taste, had Matte had more of a sense of humor, it need not have been inconsistent with the rest of her character, and it would certainly have made Blue Shoe more enjoyable.   On the other hand, the evolving relationship between Matte and her declining mother is superbly done,  one of the highlights which makes this book worthwhile.  In general, the secondary characters and Matte's relationships to them are the strength of Blue Shoe. Lamott  frequently employs paragraphs of short sentences, which sometimes works, and sometimes gets tiresome, but perhaps that is Lamott's objective. While other readers have been impressed with Lamott's  use and description of skies and weather, and certainly they add to the book,  I don't think Lamott is particularly sharp at metaphor and language.	2004-06-22

The book relies on two types of evidence: archeological, and ethnographic.  Archeological evidence can attest to the existence of warfare, not  the frequency, but the distinction is lost.  Another distinction not properly made is between peoples who fight defensive wars and aggressive wars.  Keeley devotes entirely too much time to arguing with early 20th century scholars, and the tendency of  more recent scholars to ignore evidence in order to maintain that war was primarily a function of civilization.  Ironically, Keeley  frequently cites a study of Yanomomo Indians, discredited by Kenneth Good's wonderful book (\\"Into the Heart ....\\"): Good did not find the aggression his mentor had declared existed.  Having said all this, if the reader is willing to skim at times, this is a very interesting book  It provides insight into how war was waged, the causes of war, psychology of the peoples involved, and what warfare implies as regards the human animal.  It  adds to the discussion on wars between primitives and Europeans found in Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book (\\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\").   Keeley makes a fascinating contrast between Indian/White conflicts in the US west vs. the Canadian west, and  the causes of this difference.	2004-04-25

Gazelle is a first person account by a 13 year old of the summer  in which her mother finally decides to leave her father, and herself.  The novel is psychologically true,  and one can observe the change in the girl as this event, and puberty alter her,  but that is not the primary reason for reading Gazelle.  The book is set in Egypt in the early 1950's, but it is a timeless Egypt that is evoked, the days of ancient Egypt as well as the bazaars of the 1950's..  The writing captures the impressions on all the senses, and has as a major  character  a seller/producer of perfumes whose ambition it is to rediscover some of the perfumes of  the ancients.  I recommend Gazelle especially to those readers, like myself, who have struggled with any of the novels of the Alexandria Quartet and found it mostly inaccessible.  Where I feel Gazelle fails is in the character of the father.  He just doesn't add enough to the novel for a character who is on stage so much.	2004-04-25

An anthropologist spends many years (multiple trips) amongst the Yanomamo Indians of the Amazon, who had had very little contact with civilization, and only a limited amount of its goods (e.g. some matches, a few better axes).  He eventually marries one of the tribe, who returns to the United States with him.   Anthropologist's faculty advisor is a real villain.  The account is personal, rather than scholarly, although Good did write scholarly papers, and he refrains from much abstract analysis or generalization.  The Indians have strong human emotional attachments for children, and family, and are not very violent, but the society is very sexist, tribes are prone to get mad at other tribes, and there isn't much concept of an abstract morality.  It is a utilitarian morality, and tribe members are not likely to stick their necks out to protest unfair treatment to others.  Disapproval does carry weight.	2004-04-18

One mark of a good book is that it stimulates a desire to learn more, and in that aspect \\"Science and the Quiet Art\\" definitely succeeds. It made me realize that I knew very little about common diseases, and not nearly enough about immunology, not withstanding that I have  read Clark's \\"At War Within\\", a fascinating read. Unfortunately, there are numerous problems with \\"Science and the Quiet Art\\".  It too often tries to touch all the bases, so that the writing becomes a series of elaborated enumerations.  When it does delve deeply into a subject, such as heart disease, the current (well the book was written in 1994) state of knowledge is unsatisfyingly incomplete.  The prose is pedestrian.  While Weatherall tries to stay clear of any science that would tax his powers of explanation, there are major gaps in background information: on immunology, and even on late onset diabetes, which is referenced numerous times, but left me with little insight.  Many good books deal with uncertainty by discussing alternative speculative hypotheses, but there is not enough of that here.	2004-03-28

The novel is intended as a comedic social satire, a coming of age story, and an exploration of the dislocation of the immigrant transitioning between cultures.   It works, but not particularly well.  What saves it is its sheer ebullience, some very  comic scenes and images, and its occasional genuine emotion.  Also, its originality in setting and plot.  Early in the novel, Vladmir attains a hip, New York girl friend, and moves in with her and her parents.  Her parents, in a quiet way,  are the funniest part of the book.	2004-03-28
US	49344980	R2BYSRRK5WO0E	0224618261	666826712	The Economy of Cities	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Still highly relevant.	This book, written in the 1960's, couldn't be more relevant today, in our age of outsourcing and loss of jobs.  In Jacob's thesis, cities must constantly evolve, developing new products, or they will stagnate and decline, as their old exports wither.   She makes a good case that efficiency, as reflected in the large scale, focused enterprise, can often be the enemy of innovation.  This kind of logic has been incorporated into mainstream thought, in that many large corporations try to foster growth by establishing small entrepreneurial units.  Jacobs provides a historical basis for this paradigm, as well as the detailed economics which shows it is not simply a matter of encouraging  people to be entrepreneurial. Even more interesting to me, was Jacob's well supported argument that the earliest cities preceded and fostered the development of agriculture, not the other way around.  I have read Robin Wright's Non-zero, The Logic of Human Destiny and Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, both great books, yet Jacob's thesis was still new to me. The Economy of Cities has a certain amount of unnecessary repetition, but not as much as Jacob's The Death and Life of Great American Cities, which I would also highly recommend despite that problem.  Also, and this is not a major point, Jacobs recognizes that exports may contain inputs which  have to be imported, but does not seem to see that import substitution may also rely on increasing the import of certain inputs - thereby overemphasizing the importance of import substitution relative to development of new exports  (although if we could find a substitute for oil......).  Despite having a mathematics and economics background, I did not find Jacob's D,N,A equation particularly enlightening, and advise the reader not to get hung up on it.  Jacob's use of history as a series of case studies, and her ability to extract the proper lessons even when they defy conventional thinking, is far more important than any mathematical tools.	2004-03-02

Moon Palace is a wild tale told by a narrator who lost his parents at an early age, and suffered psychological damage as a result.   I had little sympathy or interest in this character, nor did I feel the novel really explores any of the philosophical issues that the narrator is interested in.  Never-the-less, once you get through the narrator's college days, the tale is wild and original enough to make the novel worthwhile.  It has an old fashioned feel which I enjoyed.  It also has one of those endings which makes the entire novel more meaningful.  Incidentally, if you are interested in wild tales by narrators who have lost their parents at an early age and suffered psychological damage as a result, may I recommend When We Were Orphans by Kazko Ishiguro, which is a more accomplished work.     P.S.: review by Undine gives away the ending.	2004-03-02

From an evolutionary standpoint, it is reasonable to ask why we are plagued with disease, both physical and \\"mental\\", and why we age.  It is not so hard to understand if the disease is due to viruses or bacteria, which evolve along with us in an evolutionary arms race.  For this reason, some scientists have postulated that many illnesses ranging from heart disease to schizophrenia are also due to living organisms, and certainly there is increasing evidence for the importance of this viewpoint.  Nesse and Williams provide other answers.  Some of these answers - changes in environment and habits, rare mutations - are straight forward, others are more subtle and interesting.  More than anything, there are inevitably tradeoffs. The gene which causes sickle cell anemia helps protect against malaria.  In a few instances, an evolutionary perspective provides immediate suggestions for changes in medical practice, in the care of newborns and in the treatment of fever.  More significantly, it has a role to play in the guidance of future research aimed at specific diseases. The book falls somewhere between a popular explication, and an original contribution, the contribution primarily being  that it organizes many separate findings, and sets them out in a more general framework, while posing a host of possible PhD research questions. Much of the background information in Why We Get Sick is of great interest, and I only wish there was more background on the immune system. The writing is competent, and almost always clear.	2004-03-02

The class of 1969 is holding a 30th reunion, and while a group of friends commiserate, work on unresolved relationships, and even start new ones, they talk about their past.  College occurred during the Viet Nam war, but this is important primarily because one of the characters  is seriously wounded, and another character flees to Canada.  This is not a political novel.  Instead, O'Brien  looks with sympathy and some pessimism on the search for love, a good marriage, and a meaningful life.  O'Brien makes liberal use of plot devices, and he does not really break new ground, but there is a quirkiness about some of the characters and relationships I found very appealing, and there is an abundance of honest emotion.  The imaginary, but mythic character who represents one of the wounded veteran's inner voices is powerful, funny, sardonic. I found weakest the 2 women friends who are constantly drinking and bemoaning their lack of men; their histories are also kind of bizarre.	2004-02-05

Good Faith seems to have started out as a social novel, attempting to capture the spirit of America as it led to the savings and loan debacle of the  80's.  Along the way it was hijacked by the character of Marcus Burns, visionary, manipulator, master of the new thinking.  This could have been a good thing, and certainly Marcus is original, but I found him a bit over the top; also, you never see him from the inside, revealing as some of his conversations are.  Smiley is very interested in family and siblings, Good Faith is no exception, and certainly there is a lot to like here. Another focus of the book are the love affairs of the narrator,  Joe Stratford,  and Smiley does a very good job with the \\"action\\".  To my taste, however,  Smiley seems to too content to make Joe's lovers interesting people rather than interesting, nuanced characters.  While Smiley does not devote a lot of time to Joe's parents, religious fundamentalists who live what they believe, I found them surprisingly refreshing.  Good Faith is not Pulitzer prize winning material.	2004-02-04

I found the title somewhat misleading as the greater part of this book reports on the findings of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary psychology is not a new subject to me, but I found Pinker's chapter on the arts totally new and intriguing. The first part of the book explains Pinker's view on how the mind works.  Pinker is at his best employing a fluent, discursive style with references to popular culture as likely as to scholarly works.  He sometimes digresses, but hell, I finally understood what deconstructionism was.  Unfortunately, while this discursive style works with evolutionary psychology,  something more is needed when discussing neural nets, algorithmic implementations of artificial intelligence and the like. Pinker realizes this, but does not do a particularly good job.  He does have a fine chapter on visual perception, and on just how much  processing and innate assumptions are involved,  but even here I would have benefited from more recapitulation.  Pinker tends to give short shrift to ideas he doesn't hold, and has a truly absurd argument to buttress his claim that the only reason sex was an evolutionary success was to fight disease.  More importantly, he dismisses any extended discussion of consciousness as not fruitful (cf Antonio Damasio, The Feeling of What Happens).	2004-01-14

The novel is a progression of stories, each told by a different narrator, and written at a different time, but each casting light on the events and characters in the previous stories.  The title, as well as the story names, seem to suggest that this is a philosophical novel about loss of identity.  I don't quite take it away.  It is a chilling, almost soulless evocation of  the dislocations of 20th century central Europe,  a time when nihilism seems most in tune with the world.  Identities are not lost so much as stolen. It is written in a simple, effective style, and the plotting is ingenious and highly original.  One of the characters, Richard Schley, battles for the remnant of his soul, and I enjoyed most the story narrated by him.  Conversely, I found little to like or admire in the first story of the novel, so my advice to readers put off by that material is to stick with it, the rest of the novel is 5 star.	2004-01-14

An interesting aspect of Canal House is that while there are 3 main characters, it is told in the voice of only two of them.  The silent character is a foreign correspondent, Daniel McFarland, who thrives on dangerous situations.  The other two characters are a female doctor who devotes her life to relief work, and a photographer.  The doctor becomes Daniel's lover, and the photographer becomes Daniel's partner  and best friend.  I think Lee's objective is to make Daniel a tragic hero, as part of Lee's exploration of the morality of the passive observer amidst  suffering victims.  In fact, Lee's writing is of the level of a competently written amusement. None of the characters are as interesting as they would be if Lee were a better novelist, nor is the  plot particularly well constructed.  At the same time Lee is quite comfortable and capable in describing the action, whether it takes place in a refugee camp in Africa, in East Timor at the end of Indonesian occupation, or at a weekend party at the home of a wealthy and ambitious British businessman (another important character in the novel).	2004-01-10

At the end of this book Jacobs refers to a seminal work in the evolving science of organized complexity.  Yet her method of studying cities- what makes them work successfully and what causes them to fail - reminds me more of some of the 16th/17th century physical scientists such as Galileo. Like them, she looked at her world free of the misconceptions and implicit assumptions of the \\"authorities\\", the city planners who used deduction from false premises rather than induction from detailed observation.  Jacobs is a fantastic observer. Like the early scientists she is then able to generalize, always mindful of the limitations of her generalizations, and like the earlier scientists (cf. Galileo and ship building) she is interested in practical technology (in her case practical policy).  While copyrighted in 1961, this book is all too relevant today: while some of its ideas are mainstream, we are still making many of the same errors.  She draws her observations from New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco and for the reader familiar with those cities, especially the first three, there is an added dimension.  I give this book 5 stars, because it provided me with new intellectual tools for analyzing the world, and it is fun applying them.  At the same time, I will say that it is longer than it needs to be. Internalizing a concept, even one that may sound like common sense once it is enunciated, benefits from a certain amount of repetition and many examples, but there is too much repetition here.	2004-01-10

It deals with political morality and individual responsibility. It speaks in the voice of several characters, and uses such literary devices as a narrator who stops to talk to the reader, acknowledges bias, and speculates on the truth of his story.   At times it succeeds, but overall it is not nearly so good as it might be.  The plot reminds me of an episode of X-files, and I am not a big fan: sinister but not really credible forces at work.  The one character Turner is really successful with is a well meaning, lower middle class  insurance agent given to adultery and alchoholism.	2003-12-23

A remarkable book in that it is set in ancient times, yet we know so much not only about what happened, but  the political background.  Kagan speculates on the actual thinking of the main actors, and his arguments are well reasoned.  For the novice,  such as myself, I would have appreciated more information on the political parties and military capabilities: Athen's supported the democrats on many islands, but what did that word really mean; a force of over 100,000 Thracians is mentioned - then how come an Alexander the Great didn't arise earlier; archers seemed very successful, what preserved the dominance of the hoplites?  I read about half the book, not being sufficiently interested in the details  of the war for themselves, but at no time was it dull, and I would recommend it  (or part of it)  even for readers who are not that interested in this kind of history.	2003-12-23

An Englishman is sent to a Russian gulag on trumped up charges in his 30's, and serves his 25 year term.  Now he is 80,  living in a Russian village with  a couple who treat him as a father.  Reflections on his life, both gulag and village, are interspersed with the events of the day celebrating his birthday.  This is a feel good, uplifting story. While the facts of gulag life are there, few of the gulag scenes are terribly disturbing, and the only one I connected with on a deeply emotional level was one in which the Englishman recounts the daydream he escapes into to remain sane.  Instead the comradeship and humanity of the work team of political prisoners is emphasized.  After reflection, I have concluded this is an honest story, and to be both honest and uplifting - as well as interesting - is always an achievement.  As in Islands of Silence, Booth seems to have a wonderful empathy for the old.	2003-11-29

This is a straightforward exposition; it doesn't try to come at the material from a novel angle (cf Ridley's \\"Genome), nor does it dwell on arguments such as nature vs. nurture.  What it does do is explain the science in remarkable depth in a short book.  For me, much of the material was review/clarification, but I suspect it would work for those with less background.  Aldridge is disciplined in what she covers, writes clearly, uses diagrams when it will help, and seems to choose just the correct level of detail.  She includes details you might not expect to find, when they are important: for example, some human proteins cannot be made by bacteria because humans add sugars to these protein molecules AFTER they are created using RNA, and bacteria do not have this capability.  I do wish the index were more complete, it just is not helpful enough if you wish to review something covered earlier.  Also, in the last section on bio-technology, Aldridge is much less disciplined, tries to cover too much too fast, and I found myself with numerous unanswered questions.	2003-11-26

Scarred by one experience in World War I,  Alec Marquand has had a mental breakdown and will not communicate with others, although he is sometimes tempted.  He is an old man now, and the novel is told in a series of flashbacks, as well is in the present tense.  The flashbacks are to the War, but also to an earlier time when  Alec worked on an archeological investigation in northern Scotland, and comes across a mute young woman who was raised on a remote island without ever being spoken to, as part of a mad experiment.  She represents innocence, and Alec becomes infatuated.  While I found the novel quite readable - Booth is a good story teller - the War scenes are not exceptional, and the best part of the earlier flashbacks  is the depiction of how  Alec sets about his archeological work.  On the other hand, the thought processes of the old man, his interactions with staff, and most of all his appreciation of the garden in which his asylum is set, are wonderful.	2003-11-23

Kauffman is a complexity theorist/mathematical biologist.  The most intriguing concept in this book is that of an autocatalytic set: put enough kinds of organic molecules, which possibly could be developed by non-organic means, in a self contained space, which can arise in various ways, and a system with the properties of life will emerge with reasonable probability.  This is just one example of a self-organizing system. Another important idea is the importance of the boundary between sub-critical and super-critical regions of  a dynamic system: if super-critical there is chaotic change, if sub-critical there may not be enough flexibility to adapt.  Organisms  have evolved so mutation rates  lay near the boundary, but still in the sub-critical area, and it is characteristic of successful ecosystems. There is an explanation of why it is natural and logical that all the current phyla, and many more extinct ones, arose in the Cambrian period or \\"immediately\\" after, even though in the subsequent Permian extinction, for example, 96% of species became extinct, to be replaced by new ones.  While sometimes repetitious, Kaufman's prose would often do a novelist proud, and he is excellent in explaining abstract concepts, using images and graphs to good effect.  He is particularly good at explaining the work of others.  He has a very likable personality  and is great in giving credit to others, eminent scientists as well as Emily Dickinson (a computer scientist who worked for him). Why then did I not like this book even more than I did?   A major problem for me is that Kauffman's passion is for the logic, not the biology, and I would have  appreciated additional fleshing out of his models in their biological context.  His application of his models to other areas  such as technology are sometimes interesting, but not always; sometimes, what he thinks is a new insight is hardly new at all: cf.  his discussion of  the use of a set of sub-optimizations to solve one large optimization problem.  Finally, I found his discussion of ontogeny very confusing: recalling his image, I understood that there were a number of sub-systems of flashing green lights  of varying size(corresponding to cell types), so how does the total number of green lights  relates to the time for cell division?	2003-11-20
US	49344980	R19WY1LQUQQ5KR	0743241835	142788360	Best Friends: A Novel	Books	3	3	7	N	N	Written like a police detective procedural.	This is a wry tale of a married couple and the man's best friend.  It is told from the friend's point of view.  While it deals with emotions and relationships, the prose style reminds me of a police detective procedural.  I enjoyed both the style and the book, but it is simply not an outstanding work of art.  One major drawback is that the husband is such an unlikable and uninteresting \\"baby\\", as his own wife characterizes him.  If the book can be said to have a point, it is that the weight of a relationship's history can  instill a sense of obligation  and closeness even after the affection has been lost.	2003-10-25

This is a highly ambitious book about time from the physicist's point of view (there is even an interesting chapter from the psychologists viewpoint).  The concepts it deals with are profound, and sometimes absurd (cf. the paradoxes of quantum physics).   The book is well organized and well written, but at the same time I don't believe that Davies has a special gift for explanation.  I could follow much of what was being said at a superficial level, and even at a superficial level it is breathtaking.  My biggest disappointment?  Davies spends a fair amount of time on a concrete example of a case where one twin rockets into space and returns, younger than the other.  I reviewed the simple math in detail, but was still confused.  I think the problem is that as part of the example you need to separate the delay effect (the light coming from a star left years ago), from the time dilation effect (due to relativity), and Davies never bothers to show how this is done.	2003-10-25

This novel takes place in China during the Cultural Revolution and afterwards, but it is a social, not a political novel. Its protagonist is a military doctor assigned to a  hospital in a small city, with a peasant wife living in a rural village, and a long standing relationship with a nurse at the hospital.  The doctor entered his marriage out of respect for his parents who needed a daughter-in-law to help them, and he is not allowed to divorce for 18 years.  Ha Jin  tells a  quiet, unadorned story, which is mostly interesting and occasionally dull. For the most part, the characters are colorless, perhaps reflective of their situation. The doctor is a well developed character, a moral, competent, yet passive human being.   His wife is drawn broadly, but with sympathy and appreciation. The reason to read this book is to experience a slice of Chinese life of the period,  a time and culture when a small degree of freedom and material comfort went a long way.	2003-10-19

Individual ants follow a relatively simple set of rules, yet the complex, adaptive behavior of the ant colony emerges. The major accomplishment of this book is to instill in the reader a true appreciation of the power of this concept, so that your view of the world is fundamentally expanded.  Johnson also gets into related, intellectually more challenging ideas, such as group consciousness, and  has a wonderful talent for explanation: he was even able to explain to me a passage from Robert Wright, an author who is almost always  clear himself.  He incorporates  personal anecdote and intellectual history without overdoing either.  The organization of the book is not entirely linear, but I found this a positive, on balance. Johnson's ideas on the future of software were fascinating, and he managed to give me some appreciation for video games.  There was  a bit of unnecessary repetition, a few dull pages, and the amount of attention devoted to the emergent behavior of cities was not justified by the quality of material presented on this subject. Never-the-less, this is an extraordinary book, a definite must read, even for the reader with some background, which I had.	2003-10-18

This book is the story of technological development in the West from the Middle Ages until 1920.  It is organized around two related questions: what  in  civilization contributed to progress, and what were the objectives.  Pacey obviously knows the history of technology very well,  and for the most part lets the details be his guide.  While there are broader themes, local interests often play a big role.  At the same time, Pacey does not let the trees obscure the forest.   My problem with the book is that I am somewhat mechanically challenged, and simply did not understand many of Pacey's diagrams and explanations.  I would love to understand how the design of cathedrals in the Middle Ages was done differently than in the more modern use of architectural drawings, but I couldn't follow.  Never-the-less, I got enough out of the book to find it quite interesting.  I did understand the discussion of Galileo's work with levers and where it took him, and found it fascinating.   Did you know he was one of the first people in history to grapple with the problem of why scaling up mechanical models often didn't work?	2003-10-05

Unfortunately, \\"Some Can Whistle\\" is closer to Terms of Endearment, although I can take the main character, Danny Deck, more seriously.  He is the former writer/producer of a number one rated TV series, who has become depressed, and  doesn't do much on an isolated estate.  The 21 year old daughter he has never seen contacts him, and sets the plot in motion, while awakening him from his depression.  In some ways she is his antithesis: vital, joyful, impulsive. The book revels in eccentricities, but I didn't find it very amusing.  It does make some interesting explorations of the nature of love and friendship between man and woman (parental love for children is unconditional in the novel).  I found the main character interesting at times, and enjoyed the daughter.  The book's ending was moving.	2003-10-05

Before refrigeration, it was also necessary as a preservative.  Consequently, it has been a primary trade good, either by itself, or in the form of salted foods and sauces. It is therefore quite possible to look at the sweep of history by concentrating on the salt trade, and improvements in technology for acquiring or transporting salt, and get a unique and fascinating view. Remember the 3 way trade between Africa, the Caribbean and the American colonies?  Salt even figured importantly in that. Kurlansky often provides peripheral information of high interest, and for those interested in cooking, there are a bunch of recipes  from throughout history.  I wish that Kurlansky had provided a little more detail on the science of food preservation.  More of a concern is that Kurlansky has written an amazingly complete book.  For the casual reader it can get to be too much, and I sometime found a need to skim, which is never fun.	2003-10-02

This is a depression era story, written with a deliberately unsophisticated  tone,  suggestive of the \\"common people\\".  It is  an interesting novel of social history, with one character who is  well developed.  Fortunately, she is the most important character, a solidly grounded woman of the middle class who marries a shallow salesman.  Her experiences as a newly wed, and her enjoyment of the beauties of living by the ocean transcend the times. The social history focuses on a New England mill, and a terrible strike which occurs there, but a broader picture is painted, including the very rich.

It is a light, but biting comedy, with an insensitive husband,  a scorned wife who ends up on top, and a little bit of magic.  It is \\"current\\" with an older woman-younger man romance. I believe Weldon was too heavy handed with the husband's new wife even for this type of book.  At the same time, Bulgari Connection  is quite readable, and possibly cathartic for some readers.  It captures the emotions and motivations of the husband very well.  For a better, more complete novel, I would recommend Worst Fears by Weldon.  If you are very interested in the husband's character , and have the time, you might consider Tom Wolfe's \\"A Man in Full\\".	2003-10-02

This long book is first of all a mystery, a very well plotted and engaging one, if somewhat implausible.  There are two settings:  black upper class Washington of a somewhat earlier time, and ivy league law school academia. The main character, Talcott Garland, is a member of both sets, although now more a well off yuppie than rich.  Talcott  is a man of conscience and introspection, who is a member of a disfunctional family and has a disfunctional marriage.  He is well worth spending time with. The depiction of his marriage, and his totally selfish wife is very accomplished, whereas most of the other characters are those you might expect to find in an amusement. I certainly did not take away new insight into the black experience, academia or family life.  In other words, read this as a fine mystery with some elevating aspects, not as a significant piece of literature.  It is not always a page turner, especially in the first part, but I never found it dull.	2003-10-02

At the beginning of the dark ages, there was a strong and physically secure monastic movement in Ireland where books were imported and copied.  Later, monks reintroduced the books into Europe, founding monasteries, training monks and even advising \\"barbarian\\" chieftains.  This short, marvelous book  provides details, but much more.  There is a religious/moral history of Ireland, beginning in pre-literate iron age times, reconstructed from writings based on the oral tradition as well as archaeology.  There are discussions of the thought and character of St. Augustine and St. Patrick, relating the former to earlier Greek and Roman thought, and the latter to Irish as well as early Christian thought.   No final conclusion is made about the fall of Rome, but there is a discussion of the state of Roman political leadership from a different perspective, focusing on the writings of a successful man of letters and politician.  Cahill does a wonderful job of making connections, of utilizing quotes from original sources, of presenting a coherent, moral point of view, while always being interesting, even to the reader who might think he/she has little interest in religious thought or history.	2003-09-20

For the most part this book is what one might expect from the title: it covers a lot of ground quickly, and is fairly interesting and fun.   What raises the book a notch in my opinion, is that Shenkman sometimes gets into important subject areas.  For example, there is a fascinating section on myths of Nazi war preparedness and wartime production.  I had read Albert Speer's somewhat self-serving book years ago, and the material Shenkman provides helps put in better prospective the apparent lack of impact of allied bombing on Nazi armament production.  There is a chapter on the American family which is  jumpy and incomplete, but at least it whets the appetite for a book on this subject, as well as providing some fascinating facts.	2003-09-13

The protagonist, Mrs. Hawkins,  is an overweight, very competent widow in her late twenties who works in publishing and lives in an inexpensive rooming house.  Both settings provide their share of characters.  All of these characters are quite believable, and fun to know (except for the evil Hector Bartlett).  At the same time, while Mrs. Hawkins is a warm, nice person, she sees things and people quite clearly and stands up for herself.  She is also a fully realized character, which is what ultimately makes the novel worth reading.  My one complaint is that in making a happy ending, Spark sees fit to hurriedly make one of the characters (you know which one) a person who is wonderfully exceptional, and also a bit out of place in this novel.	2003-09-07

Chilli, as his name suggests, is wonderfully cool.  He is tough, but gets his way by outsmarting and confusing his adversaries.

By the end, however, the book became ALMOST tiresome.  I am not sure what the problem is.  Perhaps it is that Palmer's ultimate love interest is a totally uninspired character, and Palmer, himself, seems to be going through the motions, even while the plot twists continue unabated.	2003-09-07
US	49344980	R2SG6LJ17V9ZOW	0140008217	951028418	Brideshead Revisited	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Beautiful story.	This is a story of an aristocratic, very  Catholic family in Protestant England, and of the narrator, a well to do friend of the family who we meet as he enters Oxford, and leave as a middle aged establishment artist.  It is a novel of character, but also of class, religion,  and beauty. It is beautifully written, and is moving, sad and sometimes funny. Part of the genius of this novel is that not only do the characters evolve, but your understanding deepens, so that there is a cumulative impact.  It is a book in which you cannot always take what the characters, including the narrator,  say at face value, not because they are dissimulating, but because they don't have complete insight into themselves.  Extending this idea, I would suggest that Catholicism is not quite as dominant an influence as the book seems to suggest, and that disfunctional parenting plays a major role that the narrator (not to be confused with Waugh) is not sufficiently developed as a human being to appreciate.	2003-09-04

Another major character is an intelligent, highly principled (white) warehouseman whose path ultimately crosses the real estate developer's.  I did not find any of the other principal characters very well developed.  At the same time, Wolfe's forte is to richly imagine and convey the emotion of a scene,  and many of these tour de force scenes involve black characters.  No one will ever accuse Wolfe of subtlety, but his prose can be fun as well as effective and creative.  I won't give it away but I did not like the ending: a happy, conventional ending suggested it itself, and would actually have been more realistic than the ending chosen.  Wolfe is interested in the ancient Stoics , and does very well in giving life and relevance to their philosophy, but carries it just a bit too far; in fun?	2003-08-24

Viorst is deeply troubled by two segments of the Jewish population which have little use for the goals and thinking of the Western enlightenment: the religious - expansionist Zionists, and the ultra-orthodox Haredim.  He tries to put these movements into a historical and Biblical context as well as describing them in some detail.  It is a stretch to relate the Biblical Jewish tendency to revert to idolatry to the themes of this book, but the historical context is enlightening.  Unfortunately, I dont quite trust Viorsts scholarship when it comes to ancient history, which is treated in a rather cursory way even given the objectives of the book.  When it comes to modern Israel, Virosts writing is enriched by the many interviews he has conducted, often with people he totally disagrees with and even abhors, and he makes a definite effort to provide a fair account of their views and characters. Not withstanding this objectivity,  Viorst seems unable to truly credit genuine piety and faith, or the marvelous aspects of the Talmudic way.  Certainly, not all the traditional orthodox rabbis were acting out of pride and self-interest.  I found this annoying, even though I totally agree with Viorsts basic points.  This is an enlightening and scary book.	2003-08-03

It takes place at a remote British trading station in decline.  The protagonist, while not nave, is inexperienced.  Most of the British, especially the protagonist, are decent people, while the Congo itself is the home of depravity. The main character, while intellectually very astute, is also inexperienced, and has a fatal interest in, even attraction, to aspects of this depravity.  Had Graham Greene written this book, the story would have delved deeply into the psychology of this character, but Edric is not up to such a task as a writer.  What we have is a competently written story.  While there are some sensational events, most of the story proceeds at a leisurely pace, while still being interesting.  Edric is good with dialogue and in capturing the atmosphere. I wonder if the main event isn't too sensational, and not realistic, or at least not representative of the Congo, but for the most part Edric writes in an understated way, without loss of effect.	2003-07-17

Apparently,  modern humans began in Africa, and migrated in successive waves, filling the world.  It is astounding how much  can be learned about this from analysis of difference in the Y chromosome between populations in different areas.  Wells does an excellent job with this topic, bringing to bear his own research background and personal anecdotes, his ability to write clearly, and his sense of what is interesting.  Thus, even if not quite all the material is strictly germane, it is always interesting.  Development and buttressing of theories requires knowledge of:  geography and climate, and how it has changed over the last 100,000 years or so; archaeology; linguistic analysis, and theories of how language families evolved and dispersed.  Wells does an excellent job with all these areas, and appears quite objective in discussing the controversies surrounding some of his conclusions.  Wells treats some of the genetic science underlying the analysis in a somewhat cursory manner, so the reader without the proper background will undoubtedly be confused, or simply miss the point about such topics as to what breakthroughs, e.g. DNA hybridization,  were required before the Y chromosome could be conveniently be used for population studies. Wells could have done better without making the subject boring or too difficult.  The book also suffers very much from inadequate use of graphics.  There is a graphic depicting the major population migrations toward the end of the book, but it should have been referred to much earlier, and I suggest the reader find it and refer to it early on.  Further, while Wells refers to the current population make up of areas such as India, the material is never brought together: the book would benefit greatly from individual graphics showing migrations, over time, into India, into China, and so on.	2003-07-17

Unfortunately, I already knew what was in the last chapter, so my appreciation for the book was somewhat dulled.  Still, it is a short, well written, fairly entertaining book.

He is a master of dialog,  and writes with wit, insight and humor.   I had first read Nobody's Fool.  Empire Falls is a more serious work, as it comes to grips with evil (e.g. the police officer) and vulnerability, and its protagonist is a more \\"important\\" character, in that he embodies qualities and challenges more central to our culture.  He also has a strong inclination to be passive and accepting, which may turn off some readers. Whereas in Nobody's Fool I felt some of the plot development was unnecessary, here I found some of it detracted from the novel.  I am thinking of  much of the narrative surrounding Francine Whiting and her daughter, which was melodramatic.  Did Russo read too much Tennessee Williams before writing this novel?	2003-06-25

As is typical of a Russo novel,  the prose is often brilliant,  the scenes and dialogue vibrant.. Many scenes border on the farcical, and are very funny, without detracting from the credibility of the characters. There is a large cast of characters, and while many are typical denizens of an academic novel, the professor's colleague Tony is a particulary fresh and delightful secondary character. The professor's  relationship with his daughter is very well done, and Russo's  portrayal of the professor's marriage is insightful; at the same time the wife's character is more described than developed  Russo sometimes relies too much on \\"shticks\\", such as the use of Occam and the professor's sarcastic repartee. In summary, Straight Man is very enjoyable, well written, funny, and deals with credible people and relationships.	2003-06-22

Its objective is to identify the interactions between economic, social and political structures, technology, the objectives of warfare, and the ways war are thought.  It covers European warfare from the middle ages through World War II.  The book is replete with insights and interesting generalizations.  Yet, for a short book, I still found myself  getting bogged down in details of 16th and 17th century political history: perhaps had I a better background I would have enjoyed the politics as kind of a quick review, but I think Howard emphasizes political details too much in several of his chapters, while not focusing sufficiently on tactics and technology.   As it happened, immediately prior to reading Howard, I had read about 40 pages of Fighting Techniques of the Ancient World: Equipment, Combat Skills and Tactics by Simon Anglim et al and found this terrific, almost indispensable background (I would not recommend the rest of that book so highly).	2003-06-22

It shifts narrative perspective between the characters, but it is the youngest sibling, a young 13 year old aspiring writer, who is the primary character.  The writing in this section is often beautiful; however, it  has that almost repetitious quality that, while very effective,  made this reader sometimes want to say, enough.  This first section begins with the production of a play by the 13 year old, and this entire narrative thread is unnecessarily long.  The rest of the book is written with an economy of style and is quite arresting. The second section  is narrated by an infantryman during the retreat to Dunkirk, and really stands on its own as a an excellent piece of writing, although it fits into the overall schema of the novel.  In fact, one of the outstanding qualities of the novel is how all the sections fit together, so that the whole is so much more than the sum of the parts.	2003-06-22

The protagonist is Sully, a feckless 60 year old, a well liked if easy to antagonize citizen of a small town. He is very principled, but also very immature. Of the many well developed secondary characters, Sully's landlord, an  80 year old, widowed school teacher, and his ex-wife are done particularly well.  Like an Ann Tyler, Russo does not need much in terms of plot, concentrating on character, relationships and dialogue, leavened by warmth, wit and humor.  Toward the end there is a lot of plot development, but in my mind it is not intrinsic to the novel.	2003-06-13

This is a sequel to  Women of the Silk, and is consistent in writing style and interest.  In this novel, Pei flees to Hong Kong ahead of the Japanese, and with the support of her sisterhood of ex silk workers establishes herself.   Tsukiyama has a modest style, with simple prose, and clear cut characters.   She plots well, and affirms such virtues as loyalty and kindness and strength of character without being cloying.   Thus, she is able to expose the reader to terrible historical times, yet leave the reader with a very positive experience.	2003-05-08

Theo, a highly capable, but directionless civil engineer in his 60's, lives with Noa, a teacher in her 40's in the small dessert town of Tel Kedar.  Noa is seeking more in life, and when she comes to head an effort to establish a drug rehabilitation center she sees working on this project as the answer, but at the same time this heightens her dissatisfaction with what she sees as her lover's lassitude. The story is told in their alternating voices, a device which works very well: sometimes they are talking about the same events, more often each voice moves the story along.  Oz has a great appreciation for the physical environment and conveys this to the reader: the apartment the two share, its views, the desert surrounding the town.  The book is somewhat limited in its plot, and in its secondary characters; also, while I was interested in the relationship between Theo and Noa, I did not find them particularly interesting people.  Consequently, what is a rather short novel, almost seems too long, yet one definitely worth reading.	2003-05-07

This is the type of book where all the characters are very good at playing bridge, and the men are mostly either successful lawyers and bankers or unsuccessful businessmen; the women don't work.  It is kind of fun to read, and while I cannot take it very seriously, Auchincloss is deeply interested in the characters and society he writes about, and to a great extent he draws the reader into this world.  Auchincloss also does very well with the short story form, in that few of his stories come across as mere \\"trifles\\".  The story about a son who cannot measure up to his father's expectations, and a father who does his best to love his son, is the most meaningful of the stories.	2003-03-23

Mulberry Empire concerns itself with the events leading up to the British occupation of Kabul and its aftermath.  Hesher is more interested in his characters than in the actual events.  While often corresponding to real people, the characters are fully imagined, and, according to an afterward, Hesher also takes great liberties with the actual events.  A particularly memorable character is the Afghan Amir.   Conversely, Hesher decides to have a Russian chapter,(Russia sent an envoy to win Afghan favor), sort of a condensed \\"Father and Sons\\", which  almost reads as an unintentional satire on Russian novels. There is social commentary on English aristocratic society and its attitudes toward the colonies, which is fun, if not very original.  The writing is often eloquent, sometimes overdone.  Hesher is particularly good with scenes and dialog.  I liked the book, but when I read the afterword, and discovered I was learning much less about Afghan/English history than I had thought, it left a bad taste in my mouth.	2003-03-16

While he doesn't ignore periods entirely, O'Gormans approach is to concentrate on key architectural principles, primarily structural, and use buildings, or even simplified sketches, to illustrate them.  The book would have been even better if the glossary at the end were expanded, and used some sketches: words are frequently far less useful than pictures in explaining a term.  Also, I found O'Gormans introduction a bit forced and wordy.  Conversely, the last few pages of the book, in which he hurriedly covers such topics as the importance of history and association in interpreting architectural work, were fascinating, but rushed.	2003-03-15

The core of this book is a few chapters on the evolutionary benefit of emotion.  I found the theory rich and convincing, and the writing clear; the theory explains, for example, why one emotion (positive or negative) evolved into multiple emotions, each related to a different aspect of gene survival, such as satisfying hunger, finding a mate, etc.   Johnston's theory of emotion is a special application of a more general theory of consciousness. The rest of the book is kind of a grab bag. Johnston devotes too much space to refuting  an alternative  theory of human consciousness which he never adequately explains, and I suspect he is creating a straw man to argue against.  There are a few chapters devoted to Johnson's own simulations and special interests, and a quick review of evolutionary processes in general.  The review may be too quick for the unfamiliar reader.  The simulations involve genetic algorithms and neural networks.  I found the discussion of the former clear, but I was already familiar with the topic.  I am also somewhat familiar with neural networks, and the book is inadequate here:  Johnson seems to despair of explaining neural networks in a simple way, so kind of assumes the reader already understands them.  Outside of his special areas of expertise, Johnson may be prone to error.  Certainly, he is unaware of all the research on the socialization skills of primates, and I suspect that some of his statements on early child development are overly simplified..  All in all, this was a five star book for me, but it may not be for others with different backgrounds, either because they know less than me, or know more than me.	2003-03-05

A novelist is in pain because her daughter has become a drop out, sitting on a street corner every day. The novelist is also angry, because she theorizes that part (?) of her daughter's problems has to do with feminist issues.  The novelist believes women, and women novelists, are not taken seriously, because of male criteria of what is serious.  Now, in the \\"male\\" sense described by the novelist,  this is a more serious novel than most of Shield's, even dealing with the concept of \\"goodness\\", although not very successfully; it also has this deep thinking French intellectual character.  The novel tends to be somewhat digressive, and I enjoyed that.  It has many examples of Shield's scintillating sentences, but perhaps not as many as usual.  I had some problems with the ending, which I will now mention:  the daughter suffered from bad burns because of a failed attempt to rescue a stranger from suicide, but only after first becoming very depressed  herself(recall that the last weekend at home, she did not have the burns).   I cannot take seriously, perhaps because I am a man, that the cause of her deep depression is her future  role in the world as a woman.	2003-02-17

I didn't finish this book, but not for the reasons cited by those who have rated it poorly, and the many who agreed with them.  Although, as one reader pointed out, it doesn't really have a theme, the title not withstanding.  I suspect that if you are dealing with the history of art, architecture, literature, you either need to focus on selected pieces, with good illustrations, or write more briefly, without as many lengthy biographical discussions as are found in this book.  Barzun's brief discussion of Baroque art was terrific, for example.	2003-02-17

A family under intense economic pressure is helped, begrudgingly, by a priest and his somewhat dissolute neighbor.  Not surprisingly, the novel explores people's response to need.  Primarily, though, it is a novel of state of mind: loneliness, desperation, loss of faith, love.  It manages to be interesting, without resorting to any facile devices of plot or character to hold the reader.  The writing is very good, although if I were Bausch's editor for this book, I would have tried to eliminate some of the descriptive analogies which just don't work,  and detract from the force of his simple prose.	2003-02-16

While interested in culture, I have come to realize I am not very interested in cultural history.  For one thing, it is difficult to convey a history of art or architecture or literature to a reader unless the reader is already conversant with historical examples of all of these.  It is also true, for me at least, that a discussion of religious and philosophical ideas from a modern perspective, with reference to historical changes, is more enlightening than an attempt at a chronological history.  On the other hand, cultural histories, such as Sansom's can  provide political histories of just the right amount of detail, and this book does; and Sansom is generally able to convey the flavor of a Japanese cultural epoch.  The book lacks a proper emphasis on economic and technical history. Possibly, this is due to gaps in the historical record, at least at the time this book was written (1931), since Sansom does pay attention to  economics in the late stages of this book. The book does successfully stress  morality and character.  A Short Cultural History ends just before the Restoration in mid-19th century.  The book's style is pleasantly informal, more in the style of an essayist than an academic.  And despite the reservations I have expressed, I found that with a certain amount of skimming, it provides a very good introduction, one that encourages more reading.  I give it 5 stars because of the challenge of writing a book such as this.	2003-02-15

Henry Porter is an impulsive man,  and a gambler (horses), yet he is hesitant to risk  making a commitment to his lover.  Porter is often exasperating, and can even get tiresome. At the same time, he is as decent as his weaknesses and philosophy will allow, which is a great strength of the novel.  Porter is reflective, even if he tends to get the sequence of reflection and action reversed.  The book is interestingly plotted and sometimes funny. Porter's love for the ambience of the race track is communicated well. His girl friend is endearing, and the relationship between Porter and his daughter has many fine moments.  The end of the book is foreshadowed in an introduction - except it is not the end, as there is a subsequent \\"Hollywood\\" ending, which is not entirely convincing, even if it is enjoyable	2003-02-12

This is the story of a woman, Piper Kincaid, suffering from cancer as a  woman of 30, and reflecting back on her adolescence.  During adolescence Piper is deserted by both parents.  Greenwood creates beautiful, meaningful images; at other times she utilizes a very simple style without being dull.  The book is interesting and affecting, and the main character well developed. I think there was one plot element too many: I was furious at Greenwood toward the end, for an unnecessary, demeaning, and melodramatic plot twist.   The secondary characters are neither well developed, well motivated, nor very interesting.   At the same time, scenes with Piper's mother looking for \\"treasures\\", and with  a friend supporting her during her illness, are both very effective, in very different ways.  The scenes with her mother are poetic, almost spiritual.  The scenes with her friend are heartwarming without being sentimental.	2003-01-30

What I recalled most was quirky characters, but while the novel has them, that is hardly the point of the novel.   The novel is a (quiet) celebration of love and attraction which leaves the reader with much to think about.  These are people who are not passionately in love, but who satisfy deep emotional needs in each other and whose sex life is fine but not a matter of focus.  It is not the protagonist’s quirkiness, but his passivity which is ultimately at the heart of the story.   Tyler’s prose is unremarkable, but effective in keeping the reader’s interest in a simple, yet surprisingly rich account, which proceeds without melodrama, but with some humor.   SPOILER ALERT.  I particularly enjoyed the ending.  The fact is that Macon’s marriage was moving back on track, and could have been successful, but Muriel provided him with what Sarah could not, and needed him more.  Things are complex.  Sarah did leave Macon and treat him shabbily, yet the loss of an only child can excuse a lot. Still, had Sarah not acted as she did, I would have been more judgmental of Macon for not sticking with his marriage to her.	2003-01-20

There is nothing special about the plot, and the characters certainly aren't deeply drawn.  As light reading, I kind of liked the book. The characters are often  fun, sometimes fresh, and it is fun how so many of the characters will appear, exit, and then re-appear some  time later.  It is multi-generational, and ranges over the entire middle class, even upper lower class!   The book isn't mawkish, and fails only when attempting to meaningfully depict personality change (one partial exception being a lonely woman who meets her man). Let me confess that I stopped reading the biblical quotes which begin each chapter, and perhaps I did not properly appreciate the deeper significance of the work and its themes of salvation and  redemption.	2002-12-28

Corrections is a contemporary family story - father, mother, 2 grown sons, and a daughter, each of whom has their own time on stage.  There is a  major generational gap, the parent's marriage is dysfunctional, and the younger son and daughter are finding themselves during most of the book.  The older son leads the suburban dream life and is married to a great woman - as long as she gets her way. She made me angrier than than any fictional character I can recall, which is  a testament to Franzen's writing.  Most of the writing is superb, with changes in tone and style befitting the vast difference in personalities involved.  The family dynamics  are very familiar, yet fresh.  Franzen's evocation of senility from a first person viewpoint is high art.  Yet, I was not completely happy with the book.  I would warn the prospective reader that the young son takes stage early, and his funk was not sufficiently transformed by art for my tastes. His adventures in Eastern Europe, as well as his sister's story, are superficially interesting at best, and the political satire heavy handed.  Surprisingly, the mother emerges as the true hero of the book, despite her very conventional aspirations and reactions to things, while the character Franzen seems to most dislike is a do gooder.	2002-12-28

Martin Clay, a philosopher turned  art expert,  believes he has identified a lost Brueghel masterpiece, and suffers misadventures in trying to acquire it, on the cheap.  He must contend with the caddish owner of the painting and also the skepticism of his wife, even more of an art expert than he.  The book is intended as a satirical,  farcical comedy, and the physical comedy aspects work.  There is  a great deal of art criticism in the book, focusing on the putative cultural, historical, and personal context of the painting, and its symbolism.  I, possibly naively, took this as mostly serious, and found it wonderful, and highly educational, not just in the specifics, but in illuminating the attraction and value of this type of art criticism.  The book does a splendid job in portraying a marriage between 2 loving people, Martin and his wife, stressed by Martins unshared obsession.  I would have enjoyed the book more if Martin had fewer hoops to go through, and if some of his calculations and plans werent so absurd.  I also found the art discussions to be overdone at times.	2002-12-25

This is a book comprised of 3 novellas, each linked in some way to the novel Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf.  In fact, one of the novellas is an account of the novelist herself at the time she is writing Mrs. Dalloway.  This novella has the greatest potential, since the relationship between protagonist and novelist runs in both directions:  the protagonist reflects the novelist's current circumstances and emotional life, but also acts on Woolf's emotions and decision making.  The three novellas are structurally interwoven with alternating chapters.  Like some TV shows, however, this structure seems more useful in hiding the weakness of each novella than  in elucidating meanings and insights.  The novella about the novelist is not cohesive, although it has some strong imagery; the novella about an unhappy reader of the novel has little to it, and the novella about an editor with the nickname Dalloway is touching at times, but exploitive.  Perhaps my problem is that I never read the Woolf novel.  The book is short enough and interesting enough that you may want to read it before seeing the film, which is supposed to be good.	2002-12-14

It is annoying because Rushkoff attempts to coerce the reader into accepting his subjective views with a breathless, repetitive use of the same adjectives and opinions throughout.   It is mediocre because it is short on substantive research - either psychological or market research; possibly, a lot of the good market research is proprietary.  Its strong points are Rushkoff's anecdotes,  and some good summaries of what is going on in marketing, including advertising, sales environment, and salesmanship.  Incidentally, I am fairly liberal, so it is not my ideology speaking.	2002-11-13

I loved Clark&#146;s &#147;Sex and the Origin of Death&#148; and  &#147;At War Within&#148;.  By comparison, I was disappointed in Hardwired.  It is a serious , very informative book, and I believe you can trust Clark.  The earlier chapters, about one celled animals, a worm, and a fly, were brilliant, and a lot about the basis of  human  behavior may be learned from them. The material in the first chapter about studies of twins separated at birth is provocative. The problem is that once Clark, or was it Grunstein, got to vertebrates, the material was just not well integrated.  Too often the book read as a series of summaries of successive findings, some of which were inconsistent.  Yes, Clark had some overarching themes, repeated a number of times, but that doesn&#146;t replace a good synthesis.  There is much that is partially understood at best, and  a lot of research which casts light only on a small piece of the puzzle, making a good synthesis more difficult for conscientious authors, but that just makes their job harder, not impossible.  Bottom line: if you are interested in the subject AND in science, including technical details, read this book, until a better one comes along.	2002-11-10

A non-zero sum game is one in which the total \\"reward\\" to all players is variable, and will be maximized if the players  adapt behavior which to an outsider would look like cooperation.  Wright shows that both biological and human cultural evolution evolve toward greater \\"cooperation\\" because it promotes the survival of the specie and culture in the constant competition to survive.  For cultures, the cooperation is based on in-bred human psychological traits such as reciprocal altruism, and societal structures which promote organization, communication and trust.  Wright considers morality only at the end of this book, as more of a by-product than  a driver.  Wright has a brilliant mind, and writes in an entertaining, very understandable style.  The book provides all kinds of fascinating facts, concepts and ideas. It leaves the reader with a remarkably useful way to look at history, and pre-history.  While Wright looks at the implications for the future, I believe you could get to the same place he does without the non-zero concept.  I had the right kind of background for this book, having read Wright's Moral Animal, and books on evolution and cellular biology, but I believe readers without this background will still find the book clear, if a little more challenging.	2002-10-07

The tone is such that I kept thinking of the old sepia family photographs so many of us have.  Both mother and father are very decent people, love each other, and are compatible in most respects.  The son is confused, and certainly not exceptional in any way, but he too is very decent.   Ford takes his time in developing this story without ever being dull, and handles the ambiguities and ambivalence present in so many situations very well.  As with much of Ford's writing,  there are some sentences that I don't quite get, even after several re-reads.  I admit it: I don't know why the title is Wildlife and not Wildfire, I obviously missed something.	2002-09-21

From browsing on the net, I knew that many experts had problems with the factual basis for Keys' theory.  What I was surprised at was that in many cases the connections between cause and effect was  weak, even accepting all Key's facts.  I am thinking, for example, of his treatment of China and Korea.  I found  the discussion of the fall of the Roman/Byzantine  empires to be longer than it needed to be, too much like a conventional history.   Treatment of other subjects was very interesting, exemplified by his discussion of the British isles. The history was mostly new to me, and without unnecessary detail;  Keys' theory as to why the Celtic west was more devastated by plague than the Anglo/Saxon east, tipping the balance of power, seemed to make a lot of sense.	2002-09-21

Each chapter deals with a different issue or topic, such as medical error, surgical treatment of eating disorder, even  the decline in the number of autopsies.  The author draws on his personal experiences as a surgical resident, as well as research, both textual and journalistic.  The chapters are always fascinating.  Gawande understands systems analysis and the scientific method, and is apparently a very warm, caring personality, with a strong commitment to the best possible medical practice.  My only reservation is that in the chapters most removed from surgical practice, Gawande reaches conclusions that may overstate the case, for example in identifying the role of obesity in causing snoring, or the role  of  the unconscious in causing chronic back pain (I don't snore; I have mild chronic back pain).  In general, however, he is very sensitive to the complexities of issues, while not shying away from strong conclusions.  One chapter is on the training of surgeons, and the consequent need to subject patients to procedures performed by inexperienced hands: I came away wondering why there is not more training on animals, and how much economics or animal rights inhibits use of such training (yes, I do believe in animal intelligence and even consciousness).	2002-09-08

A wonderful book, wherein the whole is far greater than the sum of the parts - the parts being the individual characters considered in isolation.  It is relationships, and the  depiction of society which drives this book.  The balance is between hope and despair, with despair predominant.  The reader does not despair, and is mostly entranced.  Mistry does use plot, coincidence and a bit of sentimentality in the form of the warmhearted beggar king, to &quot;help&quot; the reader. The book has one truly inspiring character - the uncle, an untouchable who lives near the bottom of society, suffers terrible tragedies, but is never debased nor truly defeated.  Few readers will come away without their understanding of  the human condition greatly expanded.  A caveat: I found the beginning of the book, introducing the first character, dull, so don't give up on this book early.	2002-08-17

Rama is a brilliant, world renowned neuroscientist. Phantoms recounts personal experience and personal, sometimes humorous observations, and could be read for these qualities alone.  It is a great book because of what it has to say. The subject is how the brain works from a conceptual viewpoint, with a focus on consciousness.  Typically, the behavior of patients with brain damage suggest hypothesis, and these hypothesis are investigated by additional experimentation, as well as by brain imaging, which can detect which neurons are firing in response to stimuli.  The physiology of the brain is considered, but only to the extent necessary to the narrative. A warning to the reader:  the book is disarming in that some very difficult material is presented in  a wonderfully simple and engaging style;  this is not a book to be read in one sitting.  I would have benefited from more material in the last chapter on what is the essence of  conscious perception; while the ideas are exciting, I need more examples to pin them down.  To nitpick, I think Rama. slights the artistic capabilities of animals, and is a little condescending, and perhaps not very knowledgeable, about psychiatry.  He makes fun of evolutionary psychology, but also makes use of it.	2002-08-17

This is a fascinating discussion of evolutionary psychology: its concepts; its basis in both human experiments and animal research;  and its implications.  It is extremely well written: very readable, yet challenging.    While the logical basis of evolutionary psychology seems compelling, the human experimental basis is not all that weighty, and I suspect some of the concepts may be dropped or modified.  For example, it is hypothesized that self deception grew out of its value in making people more convincing liars; even if true, I doubt this is its only function.  Wright distinguishes between the origin of an element of our psychology, and its current role, but is perhaps not sufficiently sensitive to this distinction. Wright devotes several chapters to Darwin's  biography, using it to illustrate many of the concepts presented, and thereby annoying many readers.  I found these chapters useful, but they are definitely not at the level of the rest of the book, probably oversimplify, and possibly are unfair in some instances.  Finally, Wright's concept of determinism is very convincing - unless you have read Evolving the Mind: On the Nature of Matter and the Origin of Consciousness by Cairns-Smith, a very respected scientist, and one I can confidently bet Wright has not read.	2002-08-01

He is a reasonably competent  writer. The ultimate objective of the book is to eliminate concepts of  rigid duality: duality between humans and the rest of animals, duality between human nature and human culture. The substance of the book is an exploration of findings about animal culture (yes, animals are products of culture as well as genes), and the insights into ourselves these findings provide.  A secondary strand is a historical review of competing ideas.  I could have done with less emphasis on the secondary strand.  Part of this relates to my own interest.  Part relates to the fact that too often there is overkill: the sympathetic reader (dare I say intelligent and objective reader) is convinced by de Waal long before de Waal seems to expect him to be.	2002-07-04

Dr. Lewis is capable of wonderful writing, e.g. the introduction to this book.  He impresses me as learned and objective, and is selective in his details.  Yet I was somewhat disappointed. Lewis needed to be more selective not just in detail, but in what he was trying to accomplish. While there is some fascinating material, there isn't enough. Personally,  I was hoping for more of a book about issues, rather than about subjects: such issues as why the Middle East fell so far behind the West, why the woman's role is so circumscribed, etc.  Lewis address these, but rather briefly and not very effectively.	2002-06-17

This novel has a plot that gets out of hand, and secondary characters who are unworthy of even a competently written amusement. I like the concept: a man who is enraged by what has happened to his career and his work, finds himself with knife in hand at his wife's bedroom door.  He flees to New York, hoping to submerge his identity and thereby effect some kind of cure for his mental illness: kind of analogous to the author who cured his cancer by living in a hotel room and listening to comedy tapes.  Some of the writing is terrific and fun, so with all its warts, this may serve as a very accessible introduction to Rushdie.  It was for me.	2002-06-17

The protagonist is the father of a  struggling middle class (by Indian standards) family in 1971 Bombay.  Neither the father, nor any of the other main characters, are particularly interesting, or subtly defined.  Yet this is quite a good book.  It recreates very effectively  a time and place, and manages to be realistic without being depressing; human courage, virtue and spirit survive squalor and corruption.  The novel is a story of relationships more than of character: between the father and his family, his neighbors, and his friends, which include a business colleague, a retarded adult, a sidewalk religious painter, and something of a political hero.	2002-06-17

I got a lot out of this book: not mastery of the subject, but the kind of feel for genetics you cannot get from a popular book on the subject.  I occasionally had to skip material, but I rarely got frustrated.  It is well written, and reasonably short. Its production values are somewhat lacking for the price: self references are to chapters, not chapter sections, and the diagrams are often amateurish, although sometimes very helpful.  My background: very minimal organic chemistry (but the terms covalent bond and hydrogen bond weren't unknown to me), a popular science book on genetics under my belt, not very extensive knowledge of biology.  A book such as &quot;Dictionary of Modern Biology&quot; by Norah Rudin is a definite help, and that book is very inexpensive.	2002-05-28

Told in alternating voices and different styles, there is something jazzlike  in the book's structure. Sarah, a reconstructionist rabbi, is a primary character, but is never a narrator as I recall. Primary narrators are Pem, an Episcopalian priest who loses his faith in Christianity, Everett, a biographer/friend of Pem, and Sarah's father. Sarah's father was a Jewish boy in a ghetto which was liquidated, and it is the boy who narrates. Everett's father was a survivor of the trenches of WWI, and takes a few turns. There are various other narrators, mostly unidentified by name, but there is Albert Einstein and the \\"Midrash quartet\\".  The book is an exploration of what belief in G-d and the practice of religion can meaningfully be at our stage in civilization.  Evil, history, morality  and modern physics all play an important role in the exploration.  Did I get every word? No, and a few of the narratives will be tough going for someone with no familiarity with modern physics.	2002-05-11

A very successful man becomes obsessed with his son's fiancee, and the affair ultimately destroy both his son and himself, with obvious collateral damage.  I loved this book.  The style is of a nineteenth century novel - or as many readers have pointed out, Nabakov's Lolita.  Some of the ruminations/observations are not to be taken seriously, but are often fun; Damage is a quick, easy and fun read.  At the same time, the book is an honest, enlightening treatment of several aspects of human relationships:  obsession, of course; an alienated life; a marriage which is fulfilling for one partner even as she is aware of its limitations.  The femme fatale is intriguing, and I am not sure whether to take her seriously nor how: she seems to renounce guilt and responsibility, yet she is apparently driven by the psychological trauma to which she has been exposed.	2002-03-31

The boy fulfills his lifelong dream of becoming a great detective, returning to Shanghai, and re-opening the case. Having recently seen &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, I was sure that the narrator was psychotic, which was the only way the book really made sense.  Unfortunately, in the last chapter, which has a very different feel than the rest of the book, ends are tied together and it becomes impossible to maintain the psychotic theory.  Absent the last chapter, I thought the book was extremely well written, and therefore quite readable despite the absence of any characters you can relate to.    A chapter on Japanese/Chinese fighting in the slums of Shanghai reads like a nightmare - literally.	2002-03-17

A woman's life takes a sudden and drastic turn when she is 20 and in college, as she marries an older man with 3 children.  Now she is a grandmother, and wondering if she has led the wrong life.

A history of the Jewish people in Palestine as revealed in the archeological record, from Abraham until the Romans.

She also  give the reader a very good feel for the land,  and to a lesser extent the archeologists, and the digs. Understanding Jewish history requires some understanding of the other Middle Eastern peoples as well as the approach to ruling an empire of the major powers, Babylonia, Assyria, and Persia.  Her style is more discursive, and less organized than I would like, although this is more true of some chapters than others.  Too often she is a reporter, reporting on what various archeologists have to say, rather than a student of the material, providing a coherent view of  what is currently known, and alternative possibilities. Still, overall she does a  good job, and much of the material is fascinating.	2002-02-18

The protagonists are two civil guards alone in a small mining town threatened by guerrillas, and the loss of work.  The town is the home of a couple with a Dionysian bent, and an apparent belief in rituals over a 1000 years old.  Plot lines include the disappearance of 3 people, the past infatuation of  one of the guards,  and the guerrilla movement.  What the book is really about is the poverty and degradation of the people, and the apparent hopelessness.  Vargas writes about this obliquely, so as not to overwhelm the reader, while getting the point across.  While I liked the book, I didn't fully appreciate the Dinonysian aspect, I guess, which was a major drawback for me.  Vargas uses an interesting technique of seamlessly switching between voice and time, and back, without confusing the reader.	2002-01-24

There is a lot of  very interesting material, reasonably well organized.  Rogers, a researcher herself, seems to be aware of all the pertinent research, not only in animal intelligence, but in all the related areas:  neuro-biology, anthropology, child developmental psychology and evolution.  She takes great pride in her objectivity and care as a scientist, without being afraid to express personal beliefs, clearly labeled.  Her style leaves something to be desired.  She fears the reader will &quot;unscientifically&quot; draw   unsubstantiated conclusions, and addresses this by constant repetition of more or less the same warnings.  Surprisingly, a number of birds seem to be as intelligent as primates, and even domesticated chickens are fairly intelligent, not withstanding that birds don't have a neo-cortex, and must keep brain size small because of weight considerations.	2002-01-01

Book selectively covers modern physics, protein and neuro-biology, evolution, and theories of consciousness.  The hypothesis is that consciousness is the 3rd system to develop for organism control, the others being chemical transmitters, and the nervous system.  Hypothesis is buttressed by evolutionary arguments, and a discussion of quantum physics, showing that quantum physics is every bit as strange as consciousness,  in many respects is not understood any better, and could plausibly be linked to consciousness. I was not entirely happy with the discussion of quantum physics, but that is a tough subject.  I know the chapter on the structure of the brain could have been done much better.  And certainly you should not read this book if you aren't interested in the science for itself: had he wanted to, Cairns-Smith could have written a much smaller book to get his thoughts on consciousness (which are interesting) properly presented.

Historical amusement about the Maximillian episode in Mexico.  The book is serious about the history, viewing the times primarily from the point of view of three characters: an officer, and an official on the royalist side, and the Empress Charlotte herself.  The depiction of the urban fighting was particularly good.  It was also very good in depicting a time when fighters could show localized bravery, yet not have a deep commitment to the general cause for which they were fighting (cf Afghanistan and switching of sides).  The narrator is a German officer in World War I who has fictional encounters with the Empress Charlotte, still alive, and is given the diary of the Mexican officer.  The German officer's character is well drawn.  The book  is marred by Farcau's attempt to develop colorful characters and exciting plot details, both of which ultimately fall flat.	2001-11-23

The book is about a romantic marriage in which one spouse thinks he is marrying above himself, and the other worries she is marrying below herself. Four of the characters are narrators, the married couple, his mother and a spinster cousin. The mother imagines discussing her problems with people like Oprah and Joyce Brothers, and very different versions of their answers. The book has a good plot line, humour, interesting people, both the primary and secondary characters, and does an enjoyable job with small town life. Most of all, the book explores its main theme with honesty, and even subtlety and depth, without ever losing its light touch. Both spouses are in fact good enough for each other. This is a very enjoyable book. For me, it suffers a little from a pat ending.	2001-09-16

McCown sets out to make his protagonist, Nolan Vann, very likable, and he succeeds.  He sets out to capture the positive aura of a small town where everyone knows everyone, and he succeeds there also, without whitewashing  some unsavory aspects of small town life.  The book is quite readable, but a little too slick.  The final scene is particularly well written.  For those readers who liked this book, but wish it weren't so slick, I recommend Shameless by Lisa Reardon.	2001-08-15

First let me acknowledge I don't recall liking &quot;Red Badge of Courage&quot; that much.  The heart of this book are the battlefield experiences of the protagonist, an infantryman in World War II.  They ring true, and are informative. The main character is reasonably well drawn, and there are two minor characters of some interest.  I did not find any aspect of the book emotionally gripping, and I found the author's writing a bit heavy handed and repetitious.	2001-08-14

His wife finds out, and the marriage starts to unravel.  Truly, she is seduced - by the prospect of single career girl status, and freedom from management of the family as the responsible partner.  Matson's prose is not elegant, but is very effective as she gets into the mind of both husband and wife.	2001-06-10

A mother/daughter (21?) insinuate themselves into the household of a 54 year old professor whose wife is away for a year for professional reasons.  The plot centers on the professor's growing love for the daughter, culminating in a baby (which may not be his).  Jolly deliberately makes the daughter unattractive and passive - for the book is really about a man in a hollow marriage, although he doesn't realize it, with close friends who are well meaning, but not nurturing.  The positive characters are the slightly sinister mother, with a genius for creating a warm household, and a spinster friend who is honorable, capable, and a paragon of true friendship.  Some of Jolley's prose reads as if it were translated from German, and the plot and the professor are in some ways silly, but at the same time the professor is a very well realized character, and the book is an OK read.	2001-05-20
US	49344980	R1W33YCSXJXM8R	1569472009	28852324	The Twins	Books	2	5	8	N	N	A rather ordinary book about extraordinary events.	The twins of the title become orphans, are separated, and one grows up Dutch, the other remains German.  They have some abortive contacts, and finally meet, by coincidence, as old women taking the baths in SPA, Belgium.  Most of the book consists of  their account of their lives, with their lives post WWII treated cursorily (well the German goes a few years past the War).  The salient point is that the Dutch woman cannot forgive the German for being a German.  She does at the end, but the whole account of their interaction in SPA is very weak.  De Loo has definite  narrative skill, so the book is readable.  What I found particularly strange, is that the author seems to go out of her way to make the discovery of the two earlier visits between the two twins surprises to the reader, for no apparent reason, and to the detriment of the integrity of the story.	2000-12-17

Reading the Magician's Wife, I began to wonder if there were 2 Brian Moore's, and actually checked Amazon.<br />In the 1/3 of the book I read, there was no character  development, and the characters sketched were insipid.  There was also  little plot development.<br />For those, apparently few of you, who heard good  things about Moore, but shared my view of the book, try Cold Heaven or the  Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (2 VERY different books).	2000-07-19
