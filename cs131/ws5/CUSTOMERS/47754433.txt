Things like this are really quite rare. In my personal opinion, this is a bit of a treasure of a find.<br />The pictures alone are grand. And the word-for-word transcript of the text makes it perfect to read while simutaneously viewing the film. It really lets the impact of the weighty dialogue come out.<br />The introduction is of special interest to me- informative and insightful, it put the subject matter in context. <br />While I might have wanted more information concerning the behind-the-scenes goings on in the film, I find this a small quibble at best. Things this *unique* don't come around very often. Therefore, when they do, sieze them with joy.<br />Not only is Titus a powerful story, it is a beautiful film that speaks to our time. This book I found nearly as enjoyable as the movie. Like the other reviewer stated- if you liked the film, you will like this too.<br />I really am pleased in my decision to purchase this; I think you would be too.	2001-04-18

You forgot remedial syntax in the translation, and it spells out one thing: stupidity. Try pulling your head out of the bible and take a look around you- what do you see? Do you see a God that cares about the starving children? Do you see a God that prevents murder and rape?<br />Your God supposedly loves us.<br />Yeah, right.<br />If he existed, what reason would we have to love HIM?<br />This is a forum for the review of the item listed, not a morality play. We all have opinions. We are all entitled to share them. My review is listed already. The author doesn't believe in Satan. Satan is a metaphor, as the Amazon.com editor noted, a concept which clearly eluded your devolved pre-cambrian brain. Hence, the reason you couldn't understand the metaphorical context of the material contained with this book.<br />I don't think you read it. Christians rarely read what they critisize, much less understand it. Perhaps I'm being steriotypical; prove to me why I should not be. Just make sure to go back to school before you try, or you'll give Christianity a worse name than it already has (if that's possible).<br />Read the book. Judge for yourself, and have a great day.	2001-01-24

Along with Tori, Marilyn Manson and Mozart are my favorite artists... but Tori is starting to really outshine everyone else. There are songs in here that absolutely move me, songs like &quot;Sugar,&quot; and then you have songs like Cornflake Girl, which are very danceable.<br />This book has every song on the CD- incliding live tracks. They are, for the most part, well-transcripted, with the exception of Cornflake Girl's bass lines. This can, however, be corrected with some inprov. <br />There are full size reproductions of the photos included in the CD, which is nice. <br />Tori's musical style has changed with this record, incorporating a more electronic, spacey feel.

As any Satanist can tell you, LaVey was a man full of biting wit, iconoclastic insight and, above all, a most astute and adroit observer of human folly and misinterpretation, himself being subjected to the latter more than anyone in recent memory.<br />In this book, published after two decades of inactivity (to the world of print), LaVey sheds light on many interesting topics, bringing his usual dose of sardonic humor to the printed page.<br />A particular essay comes to mind when I think of this book- it's called &quot;Hatha Toilet Seat Meditaion,&quot; and if it doesn't solicit laughter from you, nothing will. For those of you who are familiar with it, I'm certain you're grinning right now. For those who aren't, read the book and find out why.<br />Other essays focus on some pretty forbiding topics, and the level of candor expressed by LaVey never lets us forget that while the media may have portrayed him as several things- none of which were especially flattering- we will continue to respect him for the insight he shared with us, remembering the first time we read the &quot;Satanic Bible,&quot; a book that for many of us described the thoughts we'd always thought, but never knew anyone else did.<br />So, when you read this book, say to yourself with a sigh of gratification, &quot;Hail Satan!&quot;<br />If you'd like to contact me, you can do so at Justin@radiofreesatan.com<br />If you're a recently self-discovered Satanist, you have my best wishes for your continued learning and exploration.<br />HS!	2000-12-19

Regardless of what you've heard on the media, you're not going to read about virgin sacrifices, black cats, bloody alters, et al, or any of the other silly crap the media loves to purport in its everlasting campaign of subjugation as to the true content of this highly controversial book.<br />So, here's what you will find: essays about social darwinism, indulging in the happiness of love, self-improvement, independance. Doesn't sound very Satanic to me, you say?<br />It is.<br />As far as I can see, this is one of the most misunderstood books ever written, maybe even more misunderstood than the &quot;Holy Bible&quot; itself (and that's saying a lot).<br />Today, LaVey's Satanic philosophy of hedanism and self-discipline (admittedly a curious combination) is more prevelant than ever before, which is good for Satanists, bad for Christians. <br />Contrary to popular (i.e. false) belief, the Satanic religion, or, philosophy, is not about worshipping some idiot with horns and cloven feet....<br />What is&quot;Satan&quot; to a Satanist? For most, he's simply a symbol ofpower, lust, and genteel romanticism. The reason their philosophy iscalled Satanism, when they don't even recognise any supernaturaldeities, such as god or the devil, is because Satan is a representation of the powerful concept of stratification and elitism- hence, the &quot;productive outcast&quot;. <br />Just read this book if you have not. Whether you are Satanist or not, it is enlightening and always interesting.<br />PS: keep an eye out for LaVey's outrageously comical humor- this guy could have done standup!...	2000-12-16

With this set, accompanied by an insightful and oft-times surprisingly adroit analyses, it is of course a must have for anyone interested in great art and the symbolism of the tarot.<br />Whether your interest lies primarily in tarot sets or Giger's fantastical art, it will appeal to you regardless of the particular axiom to which you subscribe.<br />One last thing- the cards are foil stamped in silver and are truly magnificent for those individuals searching for something a little different- and may well spark some creativity in those who want to visit new realms of thought as well.	2000-11-26

Many of the reactions can be judged en masse; revealing the phycophyciatry of the shadow side of America's most extreme tendrils.<br />Althrough not as shocking as its successor, it is just as relevant. The main thing one must remember is that this is a Feral House book; it's only for those who are either strong of stomach and/or cynical and looking for a jolt. <br />One of the highlights about the material covered in this tome is that it comes from such a variety of viewpoints; there are articles by wannabe serial killers, an admitted necrophiliac and and myriad others, all scraping for a place in the sordid landscape of medernism gone awry.<br />I look at it as mainly a study of subersive counter-culture- nothing more, nothing less. It will most likely continue provoking controversy and igniting sparks of angst, but this is, after all, part of Apocalypse Culture's undeniable charm.<br />All in all, this is one hell of a ride.	2000-11-25

The written material is concise and to the point, which is nice when you're dealing with such a wide topic. It is complex and thourough in its material, but after a few hours of immersion, it all makes sense as one big world, much like our own but a bit spookier.

Step by step, it shows you how to structure realistic characters by first assigning behavioral traits and appearance, and then, how to incorporate them into a salable plot. The second feature, which is somewhat innovative, explains how to structure your novel, instead of jumping right into it and getting stuck after X pages.

Don't misunderstand me- I really have an affinity toward LaVey and the glories he stands for- happiness, individualism, and nonconformity paired with strength, power, and ethics, but, please, alow me to explain, as objectively as possible, the reason why I felt this book only merited the paltry three stars I assigned to it. First of all, there just isn't much applicable material contained withing its covers. Its not a practical guide to Satanism; the books only redeeming essays are the first one, and perhaps &quot;The Good Old Days,&quot; which does manage much insight on the follies of human misconception and misinterpretation. However, those searching for LaVey's best are advised to read the Satanic Bible, The Devil's Notebook, and also The Satanic Witch. Therein you will find all the positive, wonderful info you need.

However, this is not horror. Compared to his first offering, The Books of Blood, this is tame. Regardless, his perfection of lyricism is always apparent in whatever he writes. Overall, he will impress you with his scope and vision in this novel- you may well find yourself completly immersed in the damn thing! If you are a fan of talent, I recomend it.

US	47754433	R3PE4FDV4RB4FV	0380015390	909491281	The Satanic Bible	Books	5	5	10	N	N	This is LOGIC!	I don't want to sound overzealous here, but the Satanic Bible is refreshing. It's based on logic and reason, from a purely atheistic standpoint. Really, the &quot;Satan&quot; LaVey uses is simply a literary metaphor, a symbol, that stands in stark contrast to Christian ideologies. There is nothing remotely religious or spiritual about it. It's simply a glorification of happiness and life, which is, I think, a very noble endeavor. However, I want to hasten to add that anyone out there who's going to pick this book up as a manual for demon-raising is clearly mistaken. This wasn't the author's intent.  Overall, a beuatiful, if somewhat simplistic, look at the first philosophy of logic that incorporates art and dark beuaty. A wonderful book that is sure to bring a smile to your face with its humor- read it, if only to dispell any previous misconceptions. Hail Satan! Have a nice day.	2000-10-11
US	47754433	RS1V8R0TUSOLX	0922915571	642760150	Apocalypse Culture II	Books	5	4	7	N	N	Cozy reading for any serial killer	A shockingly truthful look at the most extreme elements of our society. Topics include: how to properly cook a fetus, necrophilia, what to eat to produce the most edible excrement, cannibalism with photos, child pornography and the morally righteous, and other sordid essays. What's fascinating about this book is that it is utterly unflinching. It is sure to offend almost anyone, but it is, at the same time, relevant. All in all, an excellent read, if somewhat deranged. The illustrations are almost as disturbing as the essays, some of them being partially blacked out to maintain legal printing. However, in the color section, you can still make out the blacked-out parts. If you thought the news on T.V. was a little off the wall, you will think it's the tamest thing after finishing this rollercoaster. Thouroghly recomended, if you never want to sleep again and possible run the risk of contracting scizophrenia. Have a good day.	2000-10-11
US	47754433	R3PZFKZAKG7SOZ	0375420525	383727435	House of Leaves	Books	5	5	6	N	N	You may get lost in this book, horribly immersed...	Possibly the most &quot;real&quot; book I've ever read; it's quite possibly one of the best offering in recent memory. If you like a genuinly unnerving story, this will be just your thing. I'm not attesting that you will have nightmares spawned by it but rather that you may very well lose sleep because you find it unable to put down. Even after you've pried it out of your hands, sleep may be difficult. You'll remember those unending black corridors without windows, those shifting walls... But, yes, I digress. Anyway, if you are a fan of horror, this is one of the best. The author's invention is quite striking and nice to see after so much mediocrity in modern horror fiction- this transcends the genre well. Check it out, add it to your bookshelf, and hope that the darkness doesn't-	2000-10-11

The ending will leave you dazed, possibly. It is obvios, even from a cursory glance, that a truckload of time and effort went into the making on this thing- it shows in the developing relationship of Lecter and Starling. Some may be horrified at just how much that relationship blossoms; as for myself, I was in love too. Approach it with dread, sieze it with awe- it is a rewarding reading expierience that will leave you thinking and mesmerized. Have a good day, if after reading this that is possible.	2000-10-11
