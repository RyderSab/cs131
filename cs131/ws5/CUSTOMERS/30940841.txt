How someone can get a book published in this day and age stating that schizophrenia is a state of \\"split personality\\" is beyond me! That a \\"man of God\\" would do so little research on such an important topic is abominable. Schizophrenia is nothing to do with split personalities, as most people are aware. Tragic.	2005-10-01

This book is recommended for anyone interested in Christology or unsure about the person of Christ. It gives a comprehensive view of Christian doctrine on this topic down through the ages, as well as on other issues directly related to it, e.g., the Kingdom of Heaven, the immortality of the soul, human nature etc. The book covers all viewpoints - heterodox as well as orthodox, giving a good overview of Christological and related doctrinal controversies in church history right up to the modern day. It is certainly sweeping and covers a lot of ground, which makes for intense but informative reding at times. The text is referenced excellently, with footnotes. The only criticism of this book is that it cries out for a ruthless editor! The author, whilst effective at communicating his point for the most part, tends to be repetitive and also to either labour a point or to get there in a roundabout way. Whole paragraphs could have been shortened to a few lines and superfluous text cut. However, don't let this put you off - it's not that this book lacks anything in and of itself, rather that in places it has more than is needed!	2005-09-17

However, I do concede that our language has changed to the extent that reading such a text is difficult without aids - of which this book is chock full. You have (a) footnotes and translations of the Latin quotes (b) notes on lexical elements of the text (c) notes notes on the meaning of the text. (a) is presented alongside the text whilst (b) and (c) are at the back, which does mean flicking to and fro as you read, but the rewards are worth it! This is the standard to which all modern print editions of medieval manuscripts should aspire. Outstanding work.	2005-08-04

After this experience he wrote \\"A Grief Observed\\". \\"The Problem of Pain\\" begins \\"Not many years ago when I was an atheist ... \\". Thus, with first hand experience of the view that pain and an Almighty God cannot co-exist, Lewis plainly sets out the \\"problem\\": \\"If God were good, He would make His creatures perfectly happy, and if He were almighty He would be able to do what he wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\\" <br />From here he takes the reader on a journey that does not merely attempt to tackle the co-existence of God and pain, but scrutinses the very concepts of God, pain, love and happiness. Later, in \\"A Grief Observed\\", what was (relatively) impersonal writing on a theological dilemma in \\"The Problem of Pain\\" becomes a personal testimony.   <br />	2004-09-12

The author not only deals with the issue in a comprehensive way, but in the wider context of the church and the Holy Spirit, and in doing so deals with many other issues aound confirmation, laying on of hands, and the work of the Holy Spirit in the church.

Go one better and read a book by about the constructing of texts like this one: Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; , which although ostensibly a novel, contains more reliable facts than this text (I'm not being sarcastic! Eco works in so much non-fiction that one reviewer said the novel needed an index!) and does not pretend to be non-fiction. Eco's format allows much more scope for exploration of the issues of this genre beyond the mere construction of theories of conspiracy and revisionism and succeeds in entertaining, informing, and above all not taking itself too seriously!	2004-06-10

I first read it as a first year trainee psychiatric nurse and it saved my career. There I was sitting in a care of the elderly ward in a mental hospital thinking &quot;what the (*&amp;^ is going on here!?&quot;, ready to pack it in, and then I started to read this book. As I progressed through the book it all began to make sense and Goffman became my hero! What a man, what a researcher, what a writer. His theory is punctuated here and there with anecdotes and as such his writing is highly accessible. Fortunately, the world I experienced as a student and that Goffman wrote of is dying, but its vestiges linger and this book is still useful today. This book will one day become a historical account, but will always stand a a testimony to the need for and effectiveness of covert qualitative research.	2004-05-28

From his beginnings training as a Huey pilot, through his war experiences to the end of this account of what war does to men, Mason's writing grips you. This is mainly due to his frankness and openness in not only describing what he saw, but how it affected him.

Goffman is both a genius and a brilliant writer. His theory is clearly elucidated throughout the text by real life anecdotes. The book opens with a letter to a &quot;lonelyhearts&quot; column from a girl &quot;born without a nose&quot; which concludes &quot;Ought I commit suicide?&quot; This sets the tone for a book that pulls no punches and comprehensively addresses the alienation of those different from what is perceived to be &quot;normal&quot;.

This text is the 15th revision of the 1953 original, and this is obvious, not least from the photos used!

As a confirmed bibliophile I buy on average 5 books a week (mainly second hand, mainly for reference purposes). I generally skim over the content before filing them for future reference. This is the only book that I have ever bought which I was hooked right into and compelled to read it from cover to cover. At every opportunity I was catching up with Ronson's latest escapade. Having enjoyed his t.v. series I didn't think that this book would add much to it. It not only adds to it but explains the background &amp; context for much of want went on in Ronson's hilarious tv programmes. The difference with the book is that it is much more unsettling. We get a deeper clearer picture of &quot;Them&quot; and come to realise what a strange and somewhat disturbing place the world is. For this reason alone (apart from Ronson's excellent writing and sharp wit) this book is a must read - in particular for those with no inkling about conspiracy theories! Outstanding.	2004-04-06

The same cannot be said, however, for its sections on anatomy and physiology (A&amp;P), which are excellent in their relation of A&amp;P to mechanism of injury. The text contains some very useful diagrams in this regard, and these are also as relevant today as in 1997. <BR>So whilst this book is practically useless for learning first aid skills it is an excellent reference for relating the theory of A&amp;P to the practice first aid. If you are a student of first aid who finds A&amp;P difficult to grasp, this text will be very helpful - buit ignore the treatments.

IT is pretty much an Angliscised version of the US First Aid Manual, with changes here and there reflecting transatlantic differences in approach. It is quite well laid out, with plenty of graphic (but not gory!) illustrations of interventions and is easy-to-understand. As a Registered First Aid Instructor/Examiner I find the previous edition to have been better. For starters it was clearer on the management of the unconscious spinally injured casualty, whereas a bit of exegesis is required with this text to arrive at pretty much the same conclusion as the 7th edition (but just more subtly put - a purposefully grey area perhaps?). There are other flaws. Some of the graphics don't correlate with best practice, and the same can be said about the text in places. However, this is no fault of the book itself, which is a must-have for First Aiders as it reflects the official line on approaches and interventions. Flawed yet indispensable, with plenty of food for critical thought!	2004-03-10

It is very clearly laid out for easy reference with a comprehensive index and references for further reading if needed. The &quot;User Issues&quot; text boxes are a great innovation in this edition and will be of great use to any mental health professional, but in particular those organising psychoeducation or medication information groups. The book seems to be purposefully designed for quick reference, the first page of each chapter even has its own contents list with page numbers for issues covered in that chapter.

Nevertheless, if you have ever come across Maurice Sainsbury's &quot;Key to Psychiatry&quot;, found its approach direct, concise and waffle-free and longed for a more up-to-date text like it, this is it. It is linked throughout to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV (as every psychiatry text should!) The text doesn't spare a word, the language is rich and free of vague opinionating. Packed as it is with key facts and concise, clear explanations there is little room left for waxing lyrical!
