On Becoming Babywise, Mr. Ezzo's first book, was an invaluable resource to me when my son was an infant.  William thrived on the Babywise method, and was sleeping eight hours a night, at eight-weeks to the day.  I believe he is a happy, healthy little boy in part, because I followed Ezzo's advice.  Naturally, I picked up Babywise II when he progressed to the next stage.  Short and easy to read, this book is also affordable.<br />On Becoming Babywise II was written with the intent of guiding parents through the pre-toddler phase, 5 to 15 months of age.  Best received by advocates of the first book, as the foundation for routine is already established.  The text of this book concentrates on behavioral training and feeding.<br />Pros:<BR>Chapter 3 - Mealtime Activities<BR>This section focuses on the essentials of feeding a pre-toddler.  There are complete instructions on introducing solids, making your own baby food, finger foods, snacks, and weaning.  I found this chapter to be extremely helpful.<br />Chapter 4 - Highchair Manners<BR>Mr. Ezzo concentrates on mealtime training in this chapter, since children spend hours a week in their highchair, and the self-control learned to properly handle food, is the same self-control needed for life outside the kitchen.  I quickly realized baby hands were an issue when my son began solid foods.  Following Ezzo's advice, I held his hands underneath the highchair tray with one hand, and fed him with the other.  In a few short weeks, he understood, his hands went on his lap when eating, and when they strayed, a simple reminder was all it took.  This is an example of the practical advice presented in this chapter! <br />Cons:<BR>Chapter 4 - Highchair Manners<BR>I strongly disagree with the author's recommendation when correcting undesirable behavior.  Page 63, &quot;First correct the child verbally.  Next, provide an attention-getting squeeze or swat to the hand, if necessary.&quot;  As one who followed this advice when my son turned one, I can demonstrate why it does not work, and more importantly, why it should not be an acceptable form of instruction.  In my case, giving a light-squeeze to the hand, worked initially, then a week went by, and I discovered it required more than a light-squeeze to get my son's attention.  Another week went by, a firm-squeeze turned into a light-swat to the hand, and then he started hitting back.  According to the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics), physical punishment teaches children it is okay to hit, and suggests it does far more harm than good, page 285 in &quot;Caring for Your Baby and Young Child, Bantam&quot;, 1998. <br />Straight away, I sought the pediatrician's advice.  She offered time-out as an alternative, which my son responded to immediately and positively.  By applying the author's technique, I failed to teach my son self-control, and additional problems emerged as a result.  In addition, at what age does THIS style of disciplining begin?  Ezzo does not specify.  This book is intended for parents of pre-toddlers, 5 to 15 months old, does the author seriously expect parents to reprimand a 5-month old in the manner mentioned above?  I certainly hope not!  Immediate and consistent response to misbehavior speeds the learning process.  It took months to teach my son hitting was wrong, conversely, he learned the stereo was off limits in just weeks by employing the time-out method. <br />Final Thoughts:<BR>Firstly, I CAUTIOUSLY recommend this book.  I believe, some of the advice is disrespectful to children, and could cause behavior problems, such as illustrated with my son.  Secondly, Mr. Ezzo suggests in the introduction that graduates of his first book are best served in this book, because the foundation for routine is already established.  I agree with this, and propose that this edition may be beneficial to readers if the method promoted in the original book was helpful.  Also, if you are a person who is capable of reading beyond some of the authoritarian tendencies, some of the advice is worthy.  On Becoming Babywise II is more Christian based than the 1998 edition of On Becoming Babywise.  As a Catholic, this did not insult me, but some may find the authors writing to be too preachy.  I would have rated this book 2 ½ stars if it were available.  Due to some of the practical advice offered, I decided to error on the positive side, rather than the negative.	2003-08-18

Join the fun in this darling fourteen page, paperback, pop-up book about an \\"Easter Egg Hunt\\".  It is Easter morning, and a busy, little bunny is hopping about hiding Easter eggs for the up-coming festivities.  The children enter the scene on the next page.  They literally leap off the page and, begin racing eggs down a large grassy knoll.  Attached to the pop-up is a pull-tab that simulates running, when pulled.  This fun, interactive feature actually works, and enhances the enjoyment of the book.  The hunt in on... the children chase to and fro hunting for eggs.  They search up and down, and in and around, while a friendly squirrel pops out of a tree, and the Easter Bunny pops out from behind a flowerpot.  This scene is very cute, and celebrates the joy of the holiday.  On the next page, a very proud, little boy pops off the page.  He is holding a basket-full of eggs and says, \\"We'll find all the eggs, I'll find a whole bunch.\\"  Turn the page, and the entire scene pop's-up.  A group of children are sitting under some trees eating sandwiches and they announce, \\"Then tomorrow we'll eat egg salad for lunch.\\"<br />The watercolor images are full-color spreads, and each page features a pop-up highlight.  There is a folksy flavor to Ms. Westcott's illustrations ~ simple, yet colorful, and always amusing.  This particular publication is quite vivid, and cheerful!  One might say it is appropriately spring-like.  The text appears on both sides of the book, and it flows like a river.  \\"Easter Egg Hunt\\" is a well-written story with delightful pop-up renderings that my son adores.   Two-years and up.<br />P.S.  If you do not own a Nadine Bernard Westcott, do yourself a favor, and pick one up.  My personal favorites ~ The Farmer Brown series.	2003-04-17

Matthew Van Fleet's, \\"Fuzzy Yellow Ducklings\\" is a twenty-page, touch-and-feel foldout book about shapes, colors, and animals.  It measures approximately 7 ½\\" x 6 ¼\\" x 1\\", and is constructed of heavy cardboard with medium-weight cardstock for the pages and flaps.  Fortunately, the pages are sealed on ALL three sides, prohibiting toddler renovations.  Accentuated by glossy, white backgrounds the watercolor illustrations are expressive, colorful, and entertaining.  The text is large, black, and very basic.  It begins on the left side of the book, and consists of two-word phrases such as, \\"Fuzzy Yellow.\\"  On the right, is a \\"fuzzy\\" yellow CIRCLE, and the word \\"circle\\" is printed next to it.  The reader lifts the flap, and sees six yellow ducklings incorporated into the texture.  Printed to the side, is the word \\"ducklings.\\"  <BR>   <BR>The book continues in the same manner with a \\"Bumpy\\" Brown TRAINGLE turning into twelve grumpy toads, a \\"Furry\\" Gray SQUARE becomes four koala bears, a \\"Scaly\\" Green OVAL turns into five playful iguanas, a \\"Woolly\\" White RECTANGLE becomes seven bashful sheep, a \\"Scratchy\\" Blue CRESCENT turns into six mischievous Sharks, and a \\"Sticky\\" Pink LINE becomes eight tongue-tied frogs.  In addition, the finale is wonderful.  It is a four-page, foldout uniting all of the shapes, colors, and animals together in an amusing parade of color and pattern.  <br />\\"Fuzzy Yellow Ducklings\\" is a tactile treasure for infants and young toddlers!  From the outset, this book captivates children with peek-a-boo flaps, differing textures, and beginner's text.  Children adore this book, and learn by means of word recognition and sensation.  One could include COUNTING as an extra feature, as we usually count the animals, and it may be the reason why the author/illustrator purposely depicted them in groups of 4,5,6,7,8, and 12.  P.S. the grumpy toads are my personal favorite!  I recommend this book for children one-year and up as the interactive feature, (liftingof the flaps) is too advanced for younger babies, however an infant would probably find the images, and textures captivating all the same.	2003-03-22

Every once in a while, I come across a book that appeals to the adult in me, because it's educational, artistic, amusing or perhaps all of the above, but what fascinates me is when my son discovers the real value in a work, and teaches me a thing or two along the way. To adults \\"Where is the Baby's Belly Button\\" written and illustrated by Karen Katz appears to be a simple 14-page book that teaches body parts, but to children it's much more. <br />This nifty little board book is essentially a peek-a-boo book with flaps. It measures approximately 8 ¼\\" x 7 ½\\" x ½ \\", and is constructed of cardboard with heavy card stock for the flaps. The images are simply illustrated, yet brightly colored with creatively contrasted backgrounds that produce interest. The text appears on the left side of the book with bold, solid colored backdrops that emphasis the large black printing, and compliment the illustrations on the opposing page. The writing consists of short, four or five word sentences, such as, \\"Where are baby's eyes?\\" The reader lifts the flap and it says, \\"Under the hat.\\" The picture shows a baby hiding under a hat, and when the flap is lifted the baby's face is revealed. She is pointing to her eyes. <br />\\"Where is the Baby's Belly Button\\" has been one of my son's most requested books for a year now; he's nearly two-years old. He lovingly refers to this book as the \\"baby\\" book, and he has taught me that he has learned where his eyes, mouth, belly button, feet, and hands are, in addition to understanding the meaning of the words, hat, cup, shirt, cat, bubbles and WHERE. The question, \\"Where?\\" comes out of his mouth probably 20 or 30 times everyday, and I am certain it's because of this book. I wish the flaps were made of a heavier card stock as they have become creased over time, which is expected with use, but also preventable with a heavier stock. This book has been a huge hit, and one I haven't gotten tired of reading over and over again. I recommend this book for one-year olds and up as the interactive feature, (lifting of the flaps) is too advanced for younger babies, however an infant would probably find the images fascinating all the same.	2003-03-15

Welcome to the wonderful world of whimsical, wacky writing, and crazy, colorful caricatures - \\"He can sound like a clock, he can TICK, he can TOCK.  He can sound like a hand on a door KNOCK, KNOCK.\\"  \\"Dr. Seuss's Mr. Brown Can Moo!  Can You?\\" is an inspired introduction to sounds through rhyme and alliteration.  The text, format, and images have been adapted from the original to accommodate board book standards; yet, the prose still flows.<br />I am flabbergasted by the lack of enthusiasm for the revised board book editions of Dr. Seuss's (and others) beginner books published by Random House.  I am thrilled to have the opportunity to offer my infant son a CLASSIC narrative, by means of a board book, even in its ADAPTED form.  These magical miniatures are entertaining for little babies, who enjoy the positive interaction of cooperative play through reading.  The objectives of these small books are to appeal to newborns, and very young children with short attention spans who are not attentive enough for the full text versions, they are NOT meant to replace the originals.  Moreover, these pocketsize gems are fashioned for effortless travel to the market, on a plane, in the car, or on a train.  Hee, hee.<br />I own a lot of Dr. Seuss's first editions, in addition to a few of the board book volumes, and agree that the original \\"Bright and Early and the Beginner Books\\" are just that - ORIGINAL.  They are more amusing, entertaining, and educational, but are in fact more appropriate for older children, 3 years and older.  I believe introducing infants to creative works, such as these, only encourages listening and learning from an earlier age.  In summary, if your child is two or older purchase an original version, otherwise think of introducing your infant to the shorter, travel-anywhere format, and procure the original at a later date?  The marvelous, magical magician, who was Dr. Seuss is worth it!  Birth and up.	2003-03-13

The phrasing has been altered; still the story is the same, except mice play the human roles.  It is a delightful rendition that will appeal to both the young and old alike.  <br />Different from any other pop-up book I've seen, the backgrounds in Mr. Sabuda's books are generally solid in nature with white pop-up's that are often accented with color.  This makes a wonderful contrast of positive and negative space that is unusual, and unexpected yet, striking.  In this book, the artist has added more color to the pop-ups than in his earlier holiday works.  Creatively conceived, the detailed execution of the pop-ups is what REALLY captures the viewer's attention, and carries this book.  They are SO fantastic I have to continually remind myself it is only paper.  For instance, when Santa calls out to the reindeer, \\"No, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! . . .\\" all eight reindeer literally fly off the page in sleigh formation with Santa trailing behind.  It's brilliant!  In addition, the finale is gorgeous!  It is nearly an all-white scene with Santa in his sleigh, bidding adieu to a quaint little neighborhood down below.  The backdrop displays a snow-capped mountain with a pull-tab that allows the viewer to draw Santa and his reindeer across the sky, \\"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight.\\"  <br />\\"The Night Before Christmas,\\" is a hardbound book that measures 8 ¼\\" x 8 ¼\\" x 1 ½\\".  Highly imaginative, both conceptually and artistically this book will make a valued addition to any Christmas collection.  CAREFUL, young one's will be mesmerized by the pop-up action, and will want to grab.  Probably best for children four-years and up.	2002-11-20

As a HUGE fan of \\"The Little Mouse, the Red Ripe Strawberry, and the Big Hungry Bear,\\" I was delighted to discover the Woods have teamed up to write and illustrate \\"Merry Christmas, BIG HUNGRY BEAR!\\" <br />Several weeks ago I stopped at my local bookstore for one of my monthly visits, and while perusing the \\"New and Notable\\" section I recognized the illustrated mouse standing among a pile of Christmas packages. I snatched the book off the shelf faster than I could read the title, and immediately became engrossed! As in the first book, the illustrations in \\"Merry Christmas BIG HUNGRY BEAR!\\" are OUTSTANDING, in addition, the Woods have maintained the same cleaver writing style with the reader narrating the story. Children of all ages will enjoy this delightful Christmas tale about sharing and caring among unlikely friends. <br />The story actually begins on the title page; the beautifully illustrated two-page spread shows Little Mouse returning home with a sled full of packages. He lives in a hollow tree somewhere cold, because it has recently snowed and he's wearing a red coat with cap, and black snow boots. The narration begins on the next page, \\"Hello, little Mouse. I see you're ready for Christmas.\\" The mouse, now tucked away in his cozy, little home is placing presents around a brilliantly decorated Christmas tree that's already loaded with gifts. <br />Turn the page, \\"My goodness! What a lot of presents. Are they all for you?\\" Now we see a proud little mouse presenting his mountain of gifts to the reader. Over the next few pages the narrator (that's you) reminds the Little Mouse about the Big, Hungry Bear who's all alone in the dark cave at the top of the hill. Little Mouse boards up his door, padlocks the gifts and places tacks all over the floor in an attempt to protect his belongings. Then, the mouse hears that the Big, Hungry Bear cries every Christmas because he never receives Christmas presents, not even from Santa Claus. Little Mouse is sad for his lonelyneighbor, and decides to share Christmas with the Big, Hungry Bear. Much to Mouse's surprise the Big, Hungry Bear reciprocates the sentiment. <br />The very talented husband and wife team have done it again! This enchanting Christmas tale will have you immediately hooked on this adorable little mouse and his unlikely friend. The illustrations are very expressive for easy comprehension, and the melodic text captivates even the youngest listener. This hardbound book measures approximately 10\\" x 10\\" x 1½\\" and contains 40 beautifully rendered pages. One-year and up.	2002-11-19

Laugh aloud with Max, as his big sister Ruby endeavors to give him a bath.   Max, a typical little \\"boy\\" bunny has just finished eating his lunch, and as with most toddlers, half of his lunch is all over him rather than in his belly.  Big sister Ruby decides Max needs a bath, so as he waits for the tub to fill, Max enjoys some orange sherbet, and a cup of grape juice.  He decides his bath would be more fun eating the sherbet in the water, so as one can expect, the sherbet finds its way into the bathwater and Ruby must start over.  The same thing happens with the grape juice; consequently Ruby decides to give Max a shower, \\"You're going in the shower to get CLEAN, said Ruby.\\"  The story ends with Max pointing at Ruby's dress saying, \\"DIRTY,\\" because in her attempt to bathe her little brother, she accumulates bits of orange sherbet and grape juice all over her dress.  Max's expression is priceless!<br />\\"MAX's Bath,\\" is an adorable tale about clean and dirty that any \\"bunny\\" will find amusing.

Max doesn't like eggs, yet his big sister Ruby attempts to feed him one for breakfast. Max want strawberries, but Ruby insists he eat the egg first. Max tests his older sisters resolve by trying to get out of eating that egg: he covers it with a napkin, hides it on a chair, and finally climbs down from his chair, and hides under the table to avoid eating his breakfast. Ruby finds him, and demonstrates how good eggs are by taking a bite, \\"See, Max, said Ruby. It's a YUMMY, YUMMY EGG.\\" One bite turns into two, and eventually Ruby eats the entire egg. Max tosses a strawberry into the air, and with a big grin on his face declares, \\"ALL GONE\\". Ruby is exasperated.<br />This cute story comes as a board book, and measures 7\\" x 7\\" x ¼\\".

This little board book measures 7\\" x 7\\" x ¼\\", and is simply illustrated, yet the images are colorful and expressive for easy comprehension.  I found \\"MAX's First Word,\\" difficult to read aloud.  There are TOO many \\"he said/ she said's\\" in this story, as in many of Ms. Wells books.  For instance, the story begins, \\"Max's one word was BANG!  No, Max, said sister, Ruby.  Say CUP.  BANG, said Max.\\"  The wording is awkward to read out loud, and does not flow.

Today being a good mom or dad is often measured by the method of parenting they employ rather than the results.  Which philosophy is best for you and your family?  What is the difference between the mainstream methods today?  What are hyperscheduling, attachment parenting, and the Babywise method?  Consider, examine and evaluate all of the theories, and then observe the results of each philosophy.  Spend time with relatives and friends who follow all of the methods, then determine which parenting strategy is right for you and your family.  The best evaluation of any philosophy is found in the outcome, not in the hypothesis.  Let your eyes confirm what works for you and what does not.  Use common sense and as a result, you will be more confident as a parent. <br />PDF - Parent Direct Feeding is a proactive approach to infant care that builds confidence in parents through routine.  The confidence comes when mom/dad know what to expect.  Babywise is not hyperscheduling, or the cry-it-out method.  It is about learning how to access yours baby's cues so you can respond properly.  PDF parents feed their babies on a flexible routine every two to three hours based on baby's hunger cues.  By the way, this is what the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends.  Your approach to feeding (demand verses routine) will have a profound influence on your child's biological rhythms, ultimately affecting the establishment of healthy sleep patterns or sleep disturbances.  Babies with full tummies will establish healthy and continuous nighttime sleep, while snacking babies generally wake two to three times a night to snack some more, and this pattern is apt to continue for two very long years.  <br />If any of this sounds sensible to you, then read this book before your baby arrives, if possible, and enjoy the results.  I suspect most of the negative reviews are child-centered advocates who believe in reactive parenting, and have never read Babywise or applied the principles of Parent Direct Feeding.  If you are a first time parent or a parent looking for answers to your baby's sleeping problems read this book, and try to employ the PDF philosophy and make up your own mind.  It worked for me!  My son was sleeping 8 hours a night at 8 weeks old, and has always been a healthy, happy little boy.  Additionally, Tracy Hogg's, &quot;Secrets of the Baby Whisperer,&quot; and &quot;Secrets of the Baby Whisperer for Toddlers&quot; have also been extremely helpful parenting resources.  Good luck!	2002-08-06

Welcome to the wonderful world of whimsical, wacky writing, and crazy, colorful caricatures.  Geeezz, that's hard to read aloud.  \\"The Foot Book, Dr. Seuss's Wacky Book of Opposites\\" is an inspired introduction to contrary concepts, such as left verses right, and just plain silliness through rhyme.  Wet/dry, high/low, front/back, and well/sick... you get the gist.  William LOVED this book when he was a baby.  He especially liked the pig page.<br />\\"Up feet, down feet, here come clown feet. <br />Small feet, big feet, here come pig feet.\\"<br />It's a quick read.  It takes less than a minute to complete, although, we'd sit for 5-minutes or more just talking about the illustrations.  If you've ever read an original Seuss, then you know what I mean when I say they are whimsical, and colorful.  Of course, I am partial to Seuss's illustrated works, rather than the books he wrote and others illustrated for him, such as \\"The Eye Book\\".  His caricatures are silly, almost fantasy like.  He doesn't use a lot of color on each page; however, the overall effect is upbeat, and always entertaining.  <br />\\"The Foot Book, Dr. Seuss's Wacky Book of Opposites\\" is NOT a miniature version of Seuss's, \\"The Foot Book\\".  The text, and images have been adapted from the original to accommodate board book standards.  Yet, the phrasing and prose flow, as is apparent from the above excerpt.  <br />There has been a great deal of controversy regarding these little books.  It seems, others think the publisher, has infringed upon the copyright laws.  When these \\"Bright and Early BOARD Books\\" were released in 2001, the titles, and the covers were the same as the originals.  Some were confused, and even angered.  Apparently, they thought they were buying smaller, yet full-text copies of the originals.  It clearly states they are adapted formats on the back of the cover, so I don't understand what the fuss is all about.  Random House has since altered the titles, and covers to indicate the modifications.  For instance, \\"The Foot Book\\" has a white cover, while \\"The Foot Book, Dr. Seuss's Wacky Book of Opposites\\" has a green background even though the image is the same.<br />I, for one, was thrilled to have the opportunity to offer my infant son a CLASSIC Seuss narrative, even in it's ADAPTED form.  These magical miniatures are delightfully entertaining for little babies.  Especially for those who enjoy the positive interaction of cooperative play through reading.  The objective of these small books is to appeal to newborns, and very young children who are not attentive enough for the full-text versions.  They are NOT meant to replace the originals.  Moreover, these pocketsize gems are fashioned for effortless travel to the market, on a plane, in the car, or on a train.  Hee, hee... that's my own Seuss inspired rhyme.

It is more amusing, entertaining, and educational, but is appropriate for older children, 3 years and older.  If your child is three or older purchase an original version, otherwise think of introducing your infant to the shorter, travel-anywhere format, and procure the original at a later date?

Jane Dyer's watercolor illustrations depicting animals, and their offspring are OUTSTANDING.  Each two-page spread features a different Mommy (or Daddy), in a suitable setting, preparing their \\"little one\\" for bed.  For instance, the mice are portrayed at the base of a hallow tree, and the fish are deep at sea.  The sweet, and simple text appears on the left side of the book, while each mimicking phrase begins with, \\"It's time for bed.\\"  Subtle and rhythmic, the beat is ideal for nighttime reading, \\"It's time for bed, little sheep, little sheep, the whole wide world is going to sleep.\\"  The book concludes with a Mommy tucking a toddler into bed, \\"The stars on high are shining bright, sweet dreams, my darling, sleep well, good night!\\"  This is a precious bedtime book.<br />As an educational tool, children will learn to recognize the illustrated animals: mouse, goose, cat, calf, foal, fish, sheep, bird, bee, snake, pup, and deer.  My son received the hardcover edition of \\"Time For Bed\\" as a baby gift, and I was so captivated by the artwork that the board book version was purchased as a supplement.

Not familiar with Raffi, and his music, I was unaware of the popularity of the song, by the same title, until noticing the back cover, where it is mentioned.  I have since purchased the CD, and CAN NO LONGER read this book; I have to SING it!  \\"Baby Beluga in the deep blue sea, swim so wild and you swim so free.  Heaven above and the sea below, and a little white whale on the go.\\"<br />The editorial comments regarding Ashley Wolff's illustrations are harsh.  As an artist, I regard the work to be first-rate!  The mostly analogous color palette (ocean blues and greens) is bright and true to life, while the expressions are communicative and warm.  Perhaps, a little more contrast between the Beluga Whales and the sea is in order, but that is a personal preference.  Besides, compared to ANY of the severely cold computer-generated images available in books today, the illustrations in this book are superior.  \\"Baby Beluga\\" is a delightful book independently, although, combined with the music; it is IRRESISTIBLE!

Hee, hee.<br />I own most of Dr. Seuss's first editions, in addition to a few of the board book volumes, and agree that the original \\"Beginner Books\\" are just that - ORIGINAL.  They are more amusing, entertaining, and educational, but are in fact more appropriate for older children, 4 years and older.  I believe introducing infants to creative works, such as these, only encourages listening and learning from an earlierage.

You'll see a CIRCLE on my nose - now find five more beneath my toes.\\"  The FIVE circles beneath the rabbit's toes are: a radish, a head of lettuce, an onion, a bug, and a watermelon.<br />Each page of this little board book features a different poem, animal, and shape.

The illustrations are charming and appeal to young children, however, the text does not reference the individual shapes as a reinforcing teaching tool.  For instance, the word SQUARE is placed next to the \\"square shaped blocks\\", but does not appear in the text itself.  Emphasizing the word to the shape facilitates better learning, and the reason why this book receives a three star review.  \\"Shapes,\\" is not my favorite in the Learn and Grow Board Book series, however, the images are charming, and the prose is pleasing.

Then he thinks about an orange-FUZZY Monkey, a yellow-FEATHERED Parrot, and a Crocodile's green-ROUGH back, but in the end decides a hug from Mama is best of all - red-CRIMPED, paper dress.<br />The illustrations are simply drawn, and brightly colored for a strong visual contrast; in addition, the animals are large, providing ample space for touching and feeling.  My only objection to giving \\"Sweet Dreams, Sam\\" five stars is due to the taxing prose.  When reading to children a rhythmic cadence facilitates better listening, and holds interest for longer periods, i.e. the reason Dr. Seuss's books are classics and nursery rhymes still exist.  At any rate, the story is sweet and the \\"touch-and-feel\\" effect fascinates children.<br />Oh, as far as a previous posters comments concerning the crocodile page - I wouldn't want my son to play with Tigers, Elephant's, Monkey's, Parrots, or Crocodiles.

Come on a journey deep at sea, to count the many fish we'll see... <br />I have an affinity for well-written children's books, so when I first read Fish Eyes I was immediately taken by the prose, and the artwork.  Years later, after William was born, I realized how intriguing vivid colors were to babies.  I started reading to him when he was only a few days old, and every time I picked up THIS book, he was mesmerized.  Maybe it was the melodic phrasing, but I think it was the illustrations more than anything.  <br />Fish Eyes is primarily a numbers and counting book that is geared to the very young, 0 to 3 years.  This book counts up to 10.  In the counting section, the eyes on the fish are punched-out, leaving holes.  Children can count fish, or fish eyes.  It's an ingenious way of educating kids by interactive means. In addition, there are simple arithmetic lessons cleverly hidden in the sea for older children.  In the corner of each spread is a small fish that appears as a shadow.  The fish poses a questions like, \\"3 smiling fish, plus me make 4\\".  Only older children are apt to notice such minutiae, or I should say, they understand it at least.  That's why Fish Eyes is so brilliant.<br />The vibrant colors engaged my son so, that we would study each page after reading the text.  Once he was able to hold the book, the die-cut eyes lured him to touch.  For a long while, Fish Eyes was one of Will's favorite books.  As a result, it has become one of my standard baby gifts.  Will is 2½ now, and he knows his numbers, probably in part because of this book.  Once he gets around to learning arithmetic, Fish Eyes will surely be one we'll take off the shelf again, and again.  ... you won't be sorry!<br />Happy Reading,<BR>Mary	2002-04-12

The overall content of The Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Pregnancy and Baby Care is fundamental, and contains essential advice for inexperienced parents.  It includes step-by-step instructions on the basics: how to dress your baby, bath your baby, change your baby's diaper and so forth.  Beautiful photographs accompany the step-by-step instructions, which are helpful.  The book is compiled into three chapters: Pregnancy and Birth, Baby Care, and Health Care.  <br />The chapter on Pregnancy and Birth incorporates valuable information even for the second or third time mother, which in my opinion is the best part of this book.  The photographs are apropos, and modest considering the subjects, which are more valuable than line drawings.<br />I found the Baby Care chapter annoying. For the most part these types of books  are not read from cover to cover.  They are used as reference guides, and are generally consulted when a question or problem arises.  This chapter covers topics such as feeding, and sleeping, which are major subjects when it comes to caring for an infant.  This chapter organizes each topic in its entirety rather than dividing the text by age.  It is considerably more efficient to reference a book such as this by age, as one continues to read all that apply to that particular age group, rather than jumping around as this book does.  Moreover, growth and developmental milestones vary by age.  For more in-depth guidance on feeding and sleeping, I found Secrets of the Baby Whisperer, by Tracy Hogg and Babywise, by Gary Ezzo to be invaluable.<BR> <BR>The Health Care chapter is handy, but I discovered Caring for Your Baby & Young Child : Birth to Age 5, by the American Academy of Pediatrics to be more comprehensive on the health care subject, although the photographs in the Good Housekeeping book are impressive. <br />Some of the information in this book is outdated, Copyright 1990, and not all of the advice is recommend by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  This is not a \\"complete\\" guide as suggested in the editorial.  There are no growth and developmental markers, guidelines on cognitive development, or discussions on attachment parenting to name a few.  I am a first-time mother and forgot I had this book because it was so basic that I did not give it a second thought.  I just came across it as I was searching my library for advice on disciplining now that my son is 11 months old. I recommend this book for neophyte parents who have never been exposed to babies, whatsoever.	2002-03-31

Caring for Your Baby and Young Child: Birth to Age 5, is a basic source on health and wellness for young children.  It is systematically written, but is not completely unfeeling to the everyday challenges faced by parents.  Important child-rearing issues such as disciplining, and social and behavioral problems are mentioned only briefly, and the ever-popular debate over attachment parenting is disregarded altogether.<br />Part I is not a \\"month-by-month guide to the first year\\" as suggested in the editorial.  It is categorized as follows: 1st month, 1st month through the 3rd, 4th month through the 7th, 8th month through the 12th, 2nd year, 2nd year through the 3rd, and 3rd year through the 5th.  I did not find this arrangement to be as helpful as the month-by-month grouping of What to Expect the First Year, by Arlene Eisenberg.  Nevertheless, the overall advice is beneficial, and it is easy reading.  The basic infant care information in the early chapters is worthwhile and the Safety Check sections present invaluable advice.<br />Part II is a thorough guide to illnesses and disorders.  It is arranged alphabetically for quick reference and is comprehensive in content.  In my opinion this is the best part of the book and the reason, it should be included in every parent's library.	2002-03-23

I love this book and still refer to it weekly now that my son is fifteen weeks old.  This book was given to my husband and me, as a gift when I was six months pregnant.  Out of all the gifts we received this was the most valuable item of them all.  I have since purchased it for other expecting Mothers and hope they find it as useful as we have.   <br />This book is easy reading and Tracy has a cracking sense of humor, which helps when youre expecting.  I found the concepts on feeding and sleeping to be parallel with Gary Ezzos book, On Becoming Babywise, which I happened to follow and have a baby that slept through the night (eight hours) at eight weeks. <br />I found chapter One, Loving the Baby You Gave Birth To, and chapter Three, S.L.O.W. Down (and Appreciate Your Babys Language) the most helpful.  Thankfully I have what she dubs the Textbook Baby, but I am a vibrant and vocal person - chapter One helped me understand I needed to connect with my baby on his language not mine.  Chapter Three made it easier for me to recognize what he was trying to communicate to me so I could respond appropriately.<br />Chapter Seven, The Y  Its Your Turn, was also beneficial as I needed to hear about the importance of rejuvenating myself.  As a self-employed individual, I was used to doing it all, but now that I am a stay-at-home Mom I expect to do it all.  I am a better Mom and much happier when I take time off and let my husband take over for a few hours.  Thank you Tracy for your wisdom and special advice, I know I am a better Mom having read this book!	2001-07-26

Beginning in London, the author reveals Vincent's inner core as a young man of twenty-one working as a clerk for European art dealers while falling madly in love with a vivacious nineteen-year-old kindergarten teacher.

Vincent leaves London and embarks on journey in search of his \\"true calling\\" and ends up as a minister living in abject poverty in a Belgium miners' village. This situation strengthens his character and weakens his faith, but out of that grows a passion for art and drawing. The obsession begins and so does his real journey. This book is well worth reading.	2001-07-25

I could not put this book down. This is a very readable historical narrative set in England during the Regency Period from 1810 to 1820. Erickson paints a very vivid picture of the chaotic times in which George IV ruled as Regent while his father King George III declined into madness at Windsor, alongside the already troublesome war with Napoleon, social unrest, and economic uncertainty.	1999-08-08
