The French editor lived on Snackwells (an abomination, she thought) Lean Cuisines, and ate in her car, in front of the T.V., and on the go. The American editor dined on fresh, warm breads, rich cheeses, succulent meats and divine wine, and actually sat down, undistracted, to do so. At the end of 30 days, the French editor, despite eating so-called \\"diet\\" meals, gained about 10 pounds; the American editor lost 10-15. Bizzare occurence? Alert the 'Weekly World News'? Hardly. Instead, pick up a copy of Mirelle (pronounced Meer-Ray) Guiliano's new book \\"French Women Don't Get Fat\\".<br /><br />  Mirelle confirms what we already know- that French people in general are more active (let's face it- it's more tempting to walk to work when you have the gorgeous Parisian landscape to indulge in) and consume less junk. So basically, she's not telling us anything we haven't heard before. The difference is, the French approach isn't a quick fix drop 10 pounds in 2 days juice diet. Mirelle accounts her own experience as a foreign exchange student in America- at 18, she was bigger than she'd ever been, thanks to a new love for chocolate chip cookies, potato chips, and everything else Americans love to nosh on. When she went back home, she turned to her family doctor, Dr. Miracle (no joke), who was eager to help. And now, she's given us Dr. Miracle's instructions to help us.<br /><br />There are a few phases you must go through to change your lifestyle: Recasting, which involves keeping a 3 week food journal to identify your \\"offenders\\" (i.e. which foods are your personal temptation/downfall) and at what times you're eating the most, and Stabilization, learning to eat and move for life by adding the previous offenders in moderation. Although tedious for some, this is like having a doctor prescribe a personal diet just for you, rather than jam you into a 'one size fits all' diet. Recasting also involves what Mirelle calls \\"round up the usual suspects\\"- analyzing your journal to decide was seems excessive in your judgement- and then determining what you can live without (or at least, with less of). Dr. Miracle also 'prescribes' starting your casting off with 2 days of 'leek soup' (sort of like the French version of the cabbage soup diet, but smells less like feet).  Another staple in your house should be fresh, in season fruits and vegetables. If you're just buying what's in the supermarket, you may not be getting the best of what's in season, which yields a better flavor that reduces the need for lashings of butter and salt to improve their taste.<br /><br />  Variety is key, she adds. If you condition yourself to eating the same type of foods, your taste buds become immune to the flavor, thus requiring more to satiate your 'craving'. By adding new foods and flavors to your diet, you're more likely to eat less, and certainly will never be bored. Mirelle also gives us a few recipes that can serve as substitutes for sweets (and there's not one that calls for sugar substitute or pretend butter). All in all, \\"FWDGF\\" encourages moderation and using your common sense. If you really want dessert after dinner, skip the bread basket and only have two forkfuls of dessert- then, lay your fork down and keep up conversation until the waiter/tress asks to take your plate away. This may seem like an expensive waste, but you've satisfied your craving while not overindulging. As Oscar Wilde once said, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it\\". Likewise, a little of a well chosen dessert will keep you from gorging something worse later on. Stock good dark chocolate in the house when you get a jones for something sweet. Dark chocolate can satisfy a craving and has antioxidants that are good for those with high blood pressure (in small doses, of course).<br /><br />  A few reviewers have slammed this book for what theyfeel is the age old French snootiness about Americans. Not so. Indeed, Mirelle speaks about her love for her adopted country (her husband is American) and merely wants American women to understand that the reason French women stay slim is no secret. That Marie Claire article also mentioned that only 6% of French women are overweight/obese, as opposed to American women (over 50 percent). This is because:<br /><br />1. French women eat smaller portions of more things (each meal averages 3 courses).<br />2. French women eat more vegetables.<br />3. French women love chocolate, especially dark chocolate<br />4. French women honor mealtime rituals and never eat standing up, on the run, or in front of the T.V.<br />5. French women eat what's in season for maximum flavor, and know availability does not equal quality.<br />6. French women don't care for hard liquor.<br />7. French women walk wherever they can.<br />8. French women drink water all day long.<br />9. French women don't eat anything \\"fat-free\\", \\"sugar-free\\" or anything stripped of natural flavor. They go for the real thing IN MODERATION.<br />10. French women choose their indulgences and compensations.<br /><br />  There are many other \\"French Women...\\" things in this interesting book that you owe it to yourself to at least consider. I've gotten past the leek soup weekend, and even keep a stash on hand in the fridge to eat before my meal (lots of fiber to make me feel full). Recipes and advice abound here; the key is eating for pleasure, but in moderation; recasting your life to be healthy and happy without total deprivation or counting carbs, calories, or fat grams. Eventually, you will get to the point where you can talk and think about food positively, not dread it (French women never talk about diets either).

It's all too much!  Speaking as someone who's tried them all, I'm partial to Dr. Peter D'Adamo's \\"Eat Right 4 Your Type\\", an eating program determined by your blood type. Interestingly, all blood types are encouraged to limit wheat and dairy. But not every type of food is good for all.<br /><br />Take Type O for example (my blood type). Type O's produce more stomach acid than any other blood type, which is why we're more prone to stomach ulcers. That also means we can digest red meat more easily than other blood types. Certain fruits should be eaten in abundance; almost all dark red, blue and purple fruits are encouraged for their alkaline properties, but avoid honeydew and cantaloupe, which have the highest mold count (Type O's are proven to be very sensitive to mold). Avoid or limit high acid fruits like oranges, tangerines and strawberries. Grapefruit, oddly enough, exhibits alkaline properties after consumption, so it can be included in the Type O diet. While beef is allowed, avoid bacon, goose, ham and pork.<br /><br />Type A's are encouraged to eat fish up to 3-4 times a week to complement vegetable protein, but avoid white fish such as halibut, hake, sole and flounder (they contain a lectin that can irritate the Type A digestive tract). Type A women with a family history of breast cancer should consider introducing escargot into their diets, which helps fight cancer. Most dairy products are not favorable to Type A's.<br /><br />Type B's do nicely on a variety of meats, but Type B's must avoid chicken, which contains a certin lectin in it's muscle tissue (particularly the breast meat)which disturbs a Type B's system and could potentially lead to stroke and autoimmune disorders. Olives should also be avoided because their molds can trigger allergic reactions. Magnesium is helpful for the Type B child who suffers from eczema. Unlike other blood types, Type B's can enjoy potatoes, yams and cabbage.<br /><br />Type AB's and Type A's frequently have weaker immune systems, so a diet rich in vegetables with phytochemicals is important. AB's inherhit mostly Type A intolerances and preferences for certain fruits, and so should avoid bananas, mangoes and guava. Lemons and grapefruits are excellent for AB's. Coffee is actually recommended for AB's because it has the same enzymes found in soy. Red wine is great for AB's because of it's cardiovascular benefits. AB's should avoid all pickled condiments because of their susceptibility to stomach cancer.<br /><br />There is more information to be had, and the list of do's and don'ts extend as far as beverages, spices and condiments. I can testify to the fact that this is a diet that works; I've lost 25 pounds in 3 months since following this eating program. This book also has a handy-dandy chart for each blood type to easily locate your specific needs. Not only that, but the chart is broken down by your ethincity and the amount of food you should have per week. For example, an Asian Type O may consume meat and poultry 3-5 X a week, but an African-American Type O can have as much as 5-7 servings a week. \\"Cook Right 4 Your Type\\" offers recipes for all blood types, and each recipe will tell you which blood types they're okay for. Don't worry if there are several Types to cater to (out of the 5 of us, 2 are Type A and 3 are Type O); there are recipes that are suitable for more than one type, making mealtime preparation easier. Try it for 2 weeks, and see if eliminating wheat and limiting dairy doesn't boost your energy and lift your allergies. Dr. D'Adamo has tested people of all blood types for his extensive research, and it seems his theory is correct.

Then, she got minor rhinoplasty, bleached her hair to the point of falling out, tanned her skin until it looked plastic, purchased blue contacts, and hit the big time. Yawn.<br /><br />Touting this book as \\"tounge-in-cheek\\" is supposed to give Paris a Get Out of Jail Free Card; i.e. \\"You can't really criticize this book, because it's meant to be funny\\". But, it's not funny, and can really only be touted as part of the \\"I'm milking my 15 minutes\\" parade. If you want to know all the things  an heiress would or wouldn't do, Paris will give you the skinny (I must have missed the chapter on how an heiress should make at least one amateur porn video!). But this is fluff reading at best and trashy self-promotion at worst. If sister Nicky had written this, perhaps we could take it more seriously. Quotes such as \\"People say they envy my lifestyle, but I'm convinced that anyone with a little imagination can live 'The Life.'\\" Yeah, that and a Daddy who internationally owns one of the most expensive and popular hotel chains. I suppose that helps you attain 'The Life'; and you don't even have to work hard for it!<br /><br />Between parading herself around as a \\"celebrity\\" (and a skanky one at that) and trying to convince America that she alone has coined the phrase \\"That's hot!\\" (as if no one else before her has said it), I just can't take this girl seriously. Bottom line: \\"Confessions\\" reads like one big Paris yearbook...except with less words. If you're really into this 'Girl of the Moment', then read this. But don't expect hilarity- it's Paris's way of saying, \\"Don't you wish you were me?\\" under the guise of humor. Ugh.	2004-09-18

Once your body becomes used to those high amounts of insulin, the &quot;excess&quot; gets stored just like excess calories do- in the form of fat. Dr.'s Heller help us to understand that there are good carb choices and bad carb choices. For example, most fruits and vegetables are good carbs, while bread, rice, corn, bananas, table and other forms of sugar, sweets, etc are all bad forms of carbs. Carb Addicts is simply about making good choices. The &quot;reward meal&quot; allows you one meal a day where you can eat some bad carbs, provided you eat a small side salad first, and eat equal portions of protein and good carbs along with the bad. You can go back for more &quot;bad&quot; carbs as long as you also take more and equal amounts of protein and good carbs. Eventually, you insulins levels even out, and you lose the cravings for the &quot;bad&quot; carbs. The book gives you the list of foods to eat and foods to avoid, plus a few recipes to help you create low-carb meals. Also included is a test to find out how sensitive you are to carbs.	2004-06-20

She does, however have extensive experience from being a makeup artist since 1974, testing and comparing expensive and inexpensive products for ingredients. This alone makes her opinion worth reading.  After all, there's no sense paying over twenty bucks for  a tube of department store mascara when Maybelline Great Lash (for less than 6 bucks) not only does the trick, but works even better.<br />Paula has covered everything (and I mean everything) from blackheads to spider veins, the ever growing market for wrinkle reducing cream (Paula's take: there's no such thing) and every cosmetic company from A-Z (over 100 in all, including Target's Sonia Kashuk and BeneFit, one of my faves). Beware, though- Paula poo-poos moisturizing; in fact, she claims it's the biggest travesty committed by the cosmetics/skin care conglomerate. She doesn't think much about most company's products (accept her own, of course), especially those sold through 5S skincare, Adrien Arpel (is she still around??), Almay skin care products,  and doesn't seem too impressed with Clinique's line of skincare products. Paula is also anti-shiny eyeshadow under any/all circumstances. So as you can see, some of this is her opinion (she hawks her own line of products an awful lot), but most of it gives you useful information to compare products before buying. Definitly a book you'll want to check out before shelling big bucks out at the Estee Lauder counter (BTW, did you know EL owns Clinque and Origins?) There's also a helpful appendix in the back to define all those strange sounding ingredients listed on the labels of over 30,000 products.  If nothing else, read the &quot;Best Prodcuts Summary&quot; (located in the back, of course), which breaks products down by best cleansers (for each skin type), makeup removers, toners, exfolients, suncreens, facial masks, self tanners (hallelujah!), concealers, powders, eyeshadows, brow shapers, etc. You name it, it's here.), concealers, powders, eyeshadows, brow shapers, etc. You name it, it's here.	2004-06-14

Based on the teaching of Maria Montessori, it is designed to help toddlers and young children learn in five simple steps: observation, participation, practice, \\"eureka\\" movement, and performance. This learning process can help youngsters be well ahead of the game by the time they go into Kindergarten. While a Montessori school can help give your kids interaction with  kids of all ages, you can still apply this method of learning in the home, as Montessori pointed out: \\"Parents are still the child's first and most important teachers\\".<br />\\"Montessori Play and Learn\\" is a great tool to have in applying this learning method at home. It isn't difficult or complicated but does require dedication to achieve your goal. In other words, buying and reading this book and performing only a handful of the ideas on an irregular basis will not get your child where you'd like him/her to be. Activities are broken down by age groups, and games can be something as simple as putting 10 bottles of herbs and spices on the table for your child to smell and explore. Other tips included exploring the neighborhood, setting the dinner table, allowing them to do tasks (such as applying lip balm) you'd normally do for them (this gives them a sense of accomplishment), and other activities that stimulate our children's inborn motivation to learn. Worth finding a used or out-of-print copy until Crown decides to publish a revised edition.	2004-01-15

From Material Girl to \\"Evita\\" to \\"Ray of Light\\", she tries to keep people on their toes. But children's author? I guess she ran out of personalities to reinvent herself into, because an author she 'aint.<br />This book, while admirable in the \\"moral of the story\\" department, is long winded and just not well written. The English Roses all resent the new girl Bina because she is so beautiful. They pointedly exclude her at school and constantly whine about her to each other (healthy, no?). Though the girls mom's keep encouraging them to make friends with Binah, they refuse. These little exchanges go on F-O-R-E-V-E-R, and realistically could have been told in 4-5 pages instead of 15. Eventually, the girls have a sleepover and each have the exact same dream. In it, a fairy godmother (who is almost described before the author says \\"what am I telling you this for? you know what a fairy godmother looks like, okay?\\")sprinkles \\"dust\\" (basically a Tinkerbell rip-off)on the girls to transport them to Binah's house to see how she actually lives, and their hearts are softened (not unlike Scrooge and the ghosts of Xmas past/present/future).<br />It has been advertised as a children's picture book, when in reality, it should have been catagorized in the intermidiate readers area (ages 8-11), because there is no way a young child will sit through this overstated book (it's about 48 pages long). And while the story is mildly entertaining, it seems MA pilfered a few obvious ideas from existing literature and gave them her own spin. When \\"Mr. Peabody's Apples\\" comes out in Novemember, I won't be rushing to the store to get it. Madonna should just stick to music, because like acting, this doesn't seem to be her forte.	2003-10-10

This book is so informative, and I guarantee there's more to it than you think. Touted as a \\"self-help approach to good health\\", the PFNH guide offers natural remedies for fever, headaches, common pregnancy woes and more, from \\"abcess\\" to \\"yeast infection\\". PFNH also discusses serious diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, diabetes, heart and kidney disease, and gives advice on remedies and diets that can help aid a person who may be suffering from one of these. But wait- there's more! Includes a table of herbs, their origin, and the maladies they can help relieve, an entire section on color therapy (a fave of mine), chelation therapy, fasting, sitz baths and pain control. The back of the book holds an impressive glossary (to help define ailments that you heard about and never truly understood) and a list of manufacturers and distributors, health and medical hotlines and organizations, and even a list of suggested reading to continue your natural medicine education. No home should be without this book. I buy each new edition that comes out, because we get more than our money's worth.	2003-08-20

Learn about the necessities of foods with powerful antioxidants and enzymes, and why dairy foods aren't doing anyone any good (I recently learned that dairy cows are milked so often, they develop mastitis, a painful breast infection lactating mothers can get that causes bacteria and, in cows, pus- UGH! That stuff is in milk!). The 90 days are broken up into three 30-day parts, complete with tests to take and motivation to keep going. Dr. Maccaro considers herself to be a very spiritual person, and there is an unbelievable amount of scriptures quoted along with the nutritional information; so be prepared, if this offends you or puts you off. It is, however, a great way to rid your body of disease-friendly toxins and can be a great jump start on your road to wellness.

Did you know that you can stop sunburn pain by adding Cheerios to your bathwater (please don't recycle!)? Also, stop a shaving nick or canker sore in it's tracks with Alum (a spice by McCormick). These and other bizzare but useful tips can be found in this new book by Joey Green, author of \\"Polish Your Furniture With Panty Hose\\" and \\"Clean Your Clothes with Cheez Whiz\\". Learn how, in a pinch, you can shave with Jif peanut butter, or use a credit card to scrape your tongue when out in public and plagued with hallitosis. Gatorade can cure a headache? You bet. Then, there are some no-brainers in here (e.g. use a Q-Tip as a substitute eye shadow applicator,  shrink a zit with toothpaste- all us 80's girls know this one! But, I had no idea toothpaste could reduce redness and speed the healing of a hickey!)If you love waterproof mascara, but hate removing it, simply keep Johnson's baby Shampoo on hand and remove mascara with a small amount of it on a cottonball. This book also has \\"Strange Facts\\" at the end of each chapter; did you know Abe Lincoln's Mother died from drinking the milk of a cow that ate poisonous mushrooms? The phrase \\"cold shoulder\\" originated in the Middle Ages when Europeans fed unwanted guests leftover beef shoulder to get them to leave.

If you've ever watched &quot;Win Ben Stein's Money&quot; on Comedy Central, you can well imagine the tone in which this book is set. Basically, it's one big sarcastic celebration of the narcisstic sociopath. If you want to ruin your life, Ben suggests remembering that the world revolves soley around YOU, and no one else. This is the theme that permeates the entire book. While humorous, though, it does become very predictable what each chapter will say, and you begin to skim the chapter headings to choose which ones you really want to read. Still, all in all a funny read on the world of me-ism.	2002-09-26

While the thought of using daily affirmations for self-improvement may seem weird or make you feel a tad uncomfortable, they certainly do work.<br />Louise Hay has given us the gift of self-love. Too many people berate themselves- perhaps they can't quit smoking, or can never seem to stick to a diet or lose weight. Whether it's a tempest-like upbringing or just plain lack of self-esteem, Louise Hay helps us to understand just how important it is to not only love ourselves, but forgive and accept our flaws when we're less than perfect. Her book goes into testimonials of people she's helped, and also has a wonderful alphabetical list of ailments (from \\"abdominal cramps\\" to \\"yeast infections\\")and the correct affirmation to use that can help aid that particular ailment. My Mom is a health kinesiologist and uses Louise Hay's book and the affirmations as emotional \\"homework\\" to do. EG: I had, yet again, gotten mastitis (breast infection sometimes developed during breastfeeding) for the 3rd time. In Hay's book, mastitis is realted to mothering everyone else but yourself. The corresponding affirmation is \\"I am important. I count. I now care for and nourish myself with love and with joy.\\" After 3 days of doing this affirmation, the mastitis cleared up on it's own- no antibiotics required. So obviously, I am a loyal fan of affirmations. Give it a go- what have you got to lose?	2002-08-16

Well, we know that people are different, and so does Edward Jackowski. He classifies people into 4 different shapes: \\"hourglass\\" (gains evenly on top and bottom) \\"spoon\\" (those who are heavier on bottom than top) \\"cone\\" (top-heavy people, who are generally at higher risk for strokes and heart attacks) and \\"ruler\\" (pretty much the same measurements from chest to hips- like an hourglass but with a thicker waist). Each \\"shape\\" has exercises that are perfect for them, but there are also exercises that they should avoid. I.E. \\"Spoons\\" should never use stair climbers/steppers, walk outside or on a treadmill on an incline, do squats or lunges or rollerblade (think of those Olympic speed skaters legs!). These things will only add to the bulkiness of their bottom. Instead, they should focus on fast walking or slow jogging (without hills or incline), biking (stationery or outdoors)with light resistence only, and all variations of chin-ups, pull-ups, and push ups, just to name a few.<br />It's amazing how easy this program is. The \\"work out smarter, not harder\\" concept proves true- you'll see results pretty quickly without having to kill yourself in the process. Buy this book and figure out what your shape is, and also learn why jumping rope is the best cardio exercise around...	2002-07-26

If you, like myself, have found yourself beating your head against the wall where your toddler is concerned, you should do yourself a favor and splurge on this book. In the first &quot;Baby Whisperer&quot; book, Tracy taught us how to respect our infants without surrendering our parental control, and gave us simple acronyms (E.A.S.Y., S.L.O.W.)to remind us of her helpful advice. In her &quot;toddler&quot; edition, she uses the same method. Is your toddler refusing to potty train or play with other kids? What about dinner time- do you dread the constant fight over getting the kids to eat their veggies? Tracy gives helpful hints to overcome common toddler struggles, all the while encouraging us to praise our kids and give them the structure they need and, oddly enough, desire. Other topics are discussed, such as food allergies, kids who won't seem to talk, air travel do's and don'ts, the 12 ingredients of conscious discipline, typical or chronic sleep problems, and how to help your toddler deal with a new &quot;intruder&quot; in the form of his/her new baby sibling. Never has applying practical advice been presented in such an easy-to-follow fashion.	2002-03-09

Every story she ever told me has unfolded in this 306 page book.<br />  The authors, former nannies themselves, have a disclaimer at the front of the book stating that the characters written are completely ficticious and not based on any particular past employer. This must be why the main character's name is simply &quot;Nanny&quot;, and her employers are &quot;Mr. and Mrs. X&quot;. Nanny has just been hired by the wealthy Xes to look after their son Grayer. She is to replace the old nanny, who had the audacity to request a week off to visit her sick sister in Australia. Nanny is just looking to keep her rent money coming in while completing her senior year at NYC, but soon finds that she is drawn to poor little Grayer, who at times can be a pill, but for the most part is just a poor little rich kid who wants his parents to notice him. Mrs. X spends most of her time shopping, planning dinner parties (in the hopes that her absentee/workaholic husband just might spend time with them), and volunteering on several committees. Nanny is used to the explicit demands Mrs. X requests for Grayer, and is not surprised when Mrs. X constantly asks her to do extra chores she wasn't hired for (like picking up Mrs. X's dry cleaning, picking up about 12 different items for a 30 people dinner party, or even escorting Grayer and the Xes to a fancy executive Halloween bash dressed as a giant Teletubby- one of the funniest passages in the book). Or, she'll show up 2 hours past the time she told Nanny she'd be home, leaving Nanny little more than 15 minutes to get to a school to give a speech that will determine whether she passes or fails.  Nanny feels it's worth it, though, when the envelope of cash comes at the end of the week (&quot;most nannies are paid under the table&quot;, she tells us).<br />  Even so, Nanny gets more than she bargained for when, at the Halloween bash, she and Grayer walk in on Mr. X and his Chicago executive (whom the book simply calls &quot;Ms. Chicago&quot;)making out. Mr. X acts as if mothing is amiss, and Nanny is left to question whether or not she should report this infidelity to his wife. Slowly, Mrs. X begins to get her own suspicions, and Grayer begins to fall apart under the obvious cloud of neglect and dread that his father has stirred up. Nanny wants to run, but feels obligated to navigate these treacherous adult waters for Grayer, hoping things will calm down on their own. Meanwhile, she's also fallen for a Harvard student that lives in the Xes building, leaving Mrs. X to treat her badly and hurl rude comments at her because she is jealous of the happiness Nanny is finding with a guy. Hhhmph! How can Nanny tread through these tumultuous waters and still graduate from NYC? You'll have to find out for yourself.  I read this book in less than 48 hours because I couldn't wait to find out what outrageous thing Mrs. X would come up with next. After listening to my sis-in-law's horror stories, I found that I wasn't surprised about the Xes shannanigans. All in all, a very interesting look into the frustrating world of raising someone elses children under extreme conditions.d Grayer walk in on Mr. X and his Chicago executive (whom the book simply calls &quot;Ms. Chicago&quot;)making out.

Be that as it may, it is considered one of the most difficult maneuvers to attempt for many women (myself included), leaving them feeling inadequate and failures as Moms (which they shouldn't). \\"The Complete Guide to Breastfeeding\\" gives us information that can help make breastfeeding less of an enigma. Topics covered are:<br />*Will you, or won't you breastfeed (and the benefits of breastfeeding)<br />*Diet: What you should eat and drink<br />*Exercise: How much, how soon<br />*Care for your breasts<br />*Getting Enough Rest<br />*Drugs and the nursing mother<br />*How frequently should you nurse your baby?<br />*Your mental health<br />*Is the baby getting enough milk?<br />*The working nursing mother<br />*The Father's importance regarding breastfeeding<br />*Getting support for yourself<br />*Treating sore nipples<br />*Special situations<br />  This book isn't for everyone. As a book on breastfeeding, it obviously is biased in the \\"breast is best\\" mantra. So, if you know you're planning to bottle feed, there's no need to pick up this book. If you have tried everything and nothing seems to work for you, take solace in the fact that most of us 70's kids were bottle fed, and we're just fine! This book is merely a good tool for answering common complaints, questions and worries dealing with nursing.	2002-02-07

All you have to do is visit your local bookstore to see how many books are devoted to pregnancy, infertility, and post-partum, etc. This is the ONLY book that successfully covers them ALL. Ann Douglas has given us the COMPLETE guide to having a baby- the first 4 chapters alone are devoted to preparing the body for pregnancy, along with the feelings that go along with \\"Are we really ready to have a baby?\\". This book is chock full of charts, statistics, and best of all, advice and testimonies from 100 couples Douglas interviewed. Not as clinical and stringent as \\"What to Expect\\"...., yet a little more serious than the \\"Girlfriend's Guide...\\", \\"Mother of All Pregnancy Books\\" is the be all end all of pregnancy books. Topics covered are as follows:<br />  *What does it really cost to raise children?<br />  *Watch your weight- but not too carefully<br />  *Create a \\"sperm-friendly\\" vaginal environment<br />  *The major causes of infertility<br />  *Finding Dr. Right<br />  *The pregnancy nutrient check<br />  *The top-ten 1st/2nd and 3rd trimester worries<br />  *What's normal and what's not<br />  *Pregnancy complaints from A-Z<br />  *What pre-natal testing can- and can't- tell you<br />  *Husband coached birth, or doula (a gir's best friend!)<br />  *What labor is REALLY like<br />  *When pregnancy isn't perfect (e.g. preemies, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, intrapartum death, molar pregnancy, etc.)<br />  *Your post-partum body- what to expect<br />  *The post-partum survival guide<br />  Did I lie? This book covers it all. The biggest complaint my friend had regarding Vicki Iovine's \\"Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\" (which I loved) was how casually the topic of miscarriage was handled (my friend, who is now due the same week as me, has experienced 2 miscarriages). Ann Douglas, however, has experienced infertility, miscarriage, AND stillbirth (and has 4 kids). The caring and frank way she deals with grieving over the loss of a baby (even suggesting spending time with your baby's body, dressing it and taking your picture with it to cry and grieve over later) was touching and impressive all at once. WARNING: If you're particularly emotional, or can't handle one more added worry at this point in your pregnancy, you might want to skip this chapter, for fear of adding to the ever-growing bag of morbid worries to may already have. But, it's nice to know the subject is covered if, God forbid, the worst happens. If you are considering having a baby, or even if you're already pregnant, YOU NEED THIS BOOK.

Before going to meds, his parents wanted to explore other options. The boy's teacher suggested reading \\"Remmy and the Brain Train\\" to him every night before bed. Within ONE WEEK, his behavior toned down, and he was just fine during classes. Coincidence? Hardly. Sometimes getting a proper night's rest is all our kids need. ...).

When my daughter Madison hit 2, I thought &quot;Hmmm...she's so easy- why are all these Moms complaining about the 'terrible twos'?&quot; Then I had my son Jack, and with his 2 year birthday came a rude awakening. At 2 1/2, he's done everything from climb on top of the 5 foot dresser to play &quot;Buzz Lightyear&quot; to drawing with crayon all over my poreous limestone fireplace (which requires some kind of acid to remove). That can only mean it's time to consult Vicki Iovine and her &quot;Girlfriend's Guide&quot; series regarding the frustrating toddler years. Before you yank all your hair out (that is, what hasn't fallen out already through sheer stress),Vicki reminds us to &quot;be prepared for your VCR to be 'repaired' several times, for all dresser drawers to be liberated from their tracks, and for your car keys to end up in the sandbox, where they were employed for digging tunnels for your garage door opener to drive through&quot;. Vicki doesn't give advice through any book learning or PHd- she's just a 4 time veteran of this stuff, and it makes us Mommies feel a whole lot better that many before us have survived the toddler trenches. Topics such as how to say &quot;NO&quot; and act like you mean it, when to potty train (along with useful tips for success), and whether or not it's time to move to a &quot;big boy/girl bed&quot; , temper tantrums and arguements with someone who possesses a vocab of less than one hundred words are covered in this book. Some women prefer to go the &quot;What to Expect&quot; series route- personally, if I want technical info, I'll call my kids' pediatrcian. I much prefer to rely on the age-old tradition of the Girlfriend Grapevine to help me through the stressful fits of Toddlerhood (I don't think the doctor would be as accomodating!)	2002-01-17

Some women have contractions that they classify as &quot;uncomfortable, but not unbearable&quot;, while others say it was the worst experience of their life. Good ol' Mother Nature always keeps us on our toes by offering no set pattern to tell one way or the other what degree of pain we'll suffer during labor. Instead of offering one particular method to use, &quot;Easing Labor Pain&quot; explains every option available; Lamaze or Bradley method? Epidural? What about &quot;water birth&quot;? Should I have induced labor? What drug-free options are there to relieve pain? Any question you can think of is covered in this 247-page gem, as well as the pros and cons of any particular procedure or method, allowing you to consider all options before heading into the delivery room. I'm a 3rd time birthing veteran (1 c-section, 1 VBAC), and yet I'm still thrilled to find a book that gives me info and ideas to consider regarding this subject.	2001-12-15

Months of waiting for a new Maxted book, and it gets panned by a critic. Apparently I'm one of the few people who liked this book. Helen Bradshaw, our (s)hero in &quot;Getting Over It&quot; was a much more likable character, someone we could easily be friends with. Natalie Miller (the first-person storyteller in RIH) is a continent of dysfunctional issues; anorexia (which eventually turns to a flirtation with bulimia), parental abandonment, and bordem that leads to ditching her boyfriend and dating a &quot;bad boy&quot;. To make matters worse, Nat's best friend Babs gets married and (as a newly married couple usually does)finds she has less time to pursue her friendship with Nat. Working as PR rep for a London ballet company does nothing to help Nat see the error of her non-eating ways, either. Nat's father left them when Nat was a teenager, leaving her mother to coo and coddle her older brother Tony, but left Nat to wallow in the &quot;I'll never be good enough&quot; puddle. All this crazy factors help the reader to understand why Natalie is the way she is. Most people saw it as her being a whiner; I saw a girl with enormous issues that couldn't get out of her own way. I thought this novel was a very honest portrayl of a girl with body and abandonment issues, something too many girls are struggling with today (read &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot;). WHy did I like it so much? Maxted's hilarious and brilliant humor is still present amidst the serious stuff- I still maintain she is one of the masters of funny similes and expressions. If you're hemming and hawing on whether or not to get this book, don't go by what the critics say. Read and decide for yourself. Defenitely not as great as &quot;Getting Over It&quot;, but so what? I applaud Maxted on drifting into unchartered territory. Besides, she never promised to write &quot;Getting Over It II&quot;, did she?	2001-06-26

I was particularly interested in the tip of using coffee grounds for cellulite control. I emailed Diane Irons office regarding a more specific application of the coffee grounds, and this is what she wrote back: &quot;The coffee grounds should be warm when applied. Sit on the edge of your bathtub (or in your shower w/ newspaper beneath you). While you're massaging in the grounds, most will fall to the floor. The residue is what remains, and this should be wrapped (she didn't specify, but I assume any old plastic food wrap will do). Leave on for 5-10 minutes to detoxify and smooth. Rinse off with warm water and a loofah or vegetable brush&quot;. I tried this, and after one session, I swear my skin felt taught the rest of the day. Brilliant! If you haven't gotten this book yet, what are you waiting for?!? It's the best book of beauty/diet tips I've seen yet.	2001-06-26

Mary Pipher PhD, a clinical psychologist and part-time teacher at the University of Nebraska, gives us the answers to questions we'd rather be in denial about, but can't afford to ignore. According to Pipher, we live in a &quot;look-obsessed, media-saturated, 'girl poisoning' culture&quot;. In the younger years, girls and boys for the most part behave the same. Yet when puberty and/or junior high hits, girls are all of the sudden encouraged to be pretty and look good rather than use their brains. This book was originally written in 1995, and I think more parents want to see their kids, both boys and girls, succeed academically. However, our adolescent girls are bombarded with glossy fashion magazines, all of which have one model more skeletal than the next, and are filled with articles on how to improve your appearance (rather than how to improve your mind). In &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot;, Mary Pipher has published case studies of her clients, all of whom come from completely different backgrounds: from Jessica, a 14 year old with an absentee Father and social worker Mom, to 15 year old Ellie, the daughter of hard-working parents devoted to their children. It was interesting to read how a girls family background doesn't always matter- society as a whole has shaped the minds of our girls into thinking looks and social acceptance are the height of female importance. If you have a teenage daughter, or even if your girls are younger, you really ought to do yourselves a favor and read through this book. It's an unbelieveable eye-opener.	2001-06-21

GET OVER IT, PEOPLE!! Tiffany Trott is a 37-year old ad exec who dreams of marriage and babies- theoretically, anyway. What bad luck she has- being dumped by her current boyfriend on her birthday, being &quot;a day late and a dollar short&quot; when she could have married her great friend Kit years ago, and being thrown into the singles pool when most women her age are banging their heads about how to get their 4 year old to potty train. Tiffany decides to leave nothing to chance and takes out a personals ad and attends a Rave and several singles &quot;Eat-N-Greet&quot;s to find Mr. Right. Unfortunately, their are more Wrong's than Right's- Mungo Brown (the name says it all, doesn't it?)is a leacherous &quot;reporter&quot; who never has cash on him, Eric the artist is into art that she just cannot &quot;get&quot;, and Seriously Successful IS Mr. Right- for his wife, anyway. As Tiffany hurtles from one date failure to another, Seriously Successful is Seriously Tenacious about pursuing her, claiming time and again that his was a marriage of convience and he is unhappy- yet he can't leave because his father-in-law is his boss. Ugh. Tiffany's friends all have their own crazy circumstances, so they are of no help. Reading about Tiffany going to Introduction Agencies and singles dinners is a hoot. The ending is interesting, because there is no confirmation on what Tiffany decides to do, thereby leaving the reader to assume there will be a sequel. However, &quot;Making Minty Malone&quot; is totally about another person- interestingly, though, Tiffany Trott calls in to Minty's radio show to share her experience of how she hooked up with her man, and we discover the outcome to her situation there. I thought it was a clever twist on Wolff's part. Overall- I liked &quot;Minty Malone&quot; better, but &quot;Tiffany&quot; was a fun ride on the singles waterslide.

This is true. However, not until the new Low-Carb diet wave came along did people begin to understand that fruits and vegetables are carbs as well, and that they play a huge role in weight gain and lethargy. I have tried Atkins, the Zone, and Protein Power. &quot;The Carbohydrate Addicts Lifespan Program&quot; seems to be the easiest to follow, mainly because you don't have to calculate anything (like The Zone does)and it allows you one meal a day that you can splurge a bit. The gist of it is this: there are &quot;legal&quot; foods (proteins, fats, and &quot;favorable&quot; carbs that can be eaten at any point in the day), and there are &quot;illegal&quot; foods (i.e. dense carbs like bread, pasta, rice, certain veggies, fruit, and all forms of sugar and desserts)that may only be eaten (in moderation) during your &quot;Reward Meal&quot;. The R.M. begins with a small salad, and then your meal is divided into thirds- 1 third protein, 1 third &quot;favorable&quot; carbs, and 1 third &quot;Illegal&quot; carb of your choice. The catch is that you have to eat your portions in equal measurements (so, if you want to go back for more, you must take more of everything- not just protein or &quot;illegal&quot; carbs), and YOU MUST COMPLETE THE MEAL WITHIN ONE HOUR (this R.M. allows you to satisfy your craving while controlling your insulin release). The first day, I craved a cookie or similar &quot;bad&quot; carb. By day 2, my insulin levels must have subsided, because I felt great and didn't feel like I'd go mad with sugar withdrawls. I lost 30 pounds without feeling deprived. There are many experts out there who cry foul at a low-carb diet, since carbs provided much needed fiber and the like. That's why I think this particular program is great- you can have those fiber-rich carbs during your R.M. and receive the benefits from them without cutting them out of your diet altogether. Dr.s' Heller help us to understand how an addiction to carbs and the insulin they release can make even the most strong-willed person cave and feel like a miserable failure. If you've tried every other program with little or no results, here's one that you can live with.

Yes- there are some no-brainer ideas (get more shelving, add an extra clothes rail), but I was impressed with Morgenstern's concept of recognizing your &quot;organizational personality&quot;. Much like dieting and exercising, if you try to organize around a personality type that doesn't suit your style, chances are you won't stick with it. Once you conclude what your &quot;type&quot; is, Morgenstern gives you great ideas for purging the unused junk out of your closets and cabinets -&quot;anything that hasn't been used in the last 6 months, unless it's a reliable cocktail dress or seasonal clothes, should GO&quot;- which includes that goopy makeup sitting in a container under your bathroom sink (you know who you are!), or lotions and toiletries you bought but rarely, if ever, used. It's amazing- my Mom has always said, &quot;The state of your home is a reflection of the state of your mind&quot;. This must be part of Feng Shui- it's true, though. Once I applied Morgenstern's ideas and de-cluttered my life, my mind felt less cluttered as well. Don't forget to check out Morgenstern's other book &quot;Time Management from the Inside Out&quot;.	2001-06-01

However, this &quot;Guide&quot; was dumb- it was basically a re-hash of the highlights in the 2 &quot;Bridget&quot; novels. If you've never read the books, this &quot;guide&quot; might give you just the taste of Bridget you need to get motivated to read the books. If, however, you are a devoted Bridget fan, this book will be useless to you. Bridget gives us the finer points on ordering a pizza, along with photos, just in case the written instructions were confusing. She gives us advice on cooking a lavish dinner for guests (Hello??? Didn't we already chew this in the first novel- ala Bridget's birthday bash?!?). And, Bridget gets to play pseudo-psychiatrist with Jude, Shazzer, her Mum and her Dad- each &quot;session&quot; spans merely 2 paragraphs a piece and ends with Bridget and her &quot;client&quot; getting sloshed on Chardonnay. Yeah, okay- isn't that what she and her mates do about 5 out of 7 nights of the week? In all fairness, I wasn't exactly sure what I expected when I got this &quot;guide&quot;, but I know I expected more than a rehash of the 2 best-selling novels. It seems to me that Fielding wants to cash in while the &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; movie is out, thereby striking while the iron is hot. That's fine- just please, Helen, don't recycle old Bridget material. We're hoping for something new! I did, however, give this 2 stars because I chuckled in exactly 3 places, and because I love Bridget and the joy she's brought me and my friends. But, this book isn't worth going ga-ga over.	2001-04-23

Personally, I think they were trying to lure me into the &quot;mommy club&quot; by not telling me the rest of the story. While having babies is exciting and defenitely one of life's undisputed miracles, there is an aspect of it that changes you forever. You have to give up a lot of selfish behavior (in that, I mean things that aren't in and of themselves selfish in nature, just things you normally do for yourself: i.e. taking a long, hot bath or having a bit of a lie down whenever you feel like it)and in the process, you lose a bit of yourself. Thank goodness Vicki Iovine and her gaggle of girlfriends have returned to tell me that I'm not alone! It's amazing: you think that passing a certain &quot;stage&quot; (i.e. teething, potty training)is a relief, but in the process, you begin to feel your purpose slip away as your kids grow more and more independent. You begin to think, now what? I've been raising my kids for X amount of years, and I've lost who I am. Wasn't I supposed to just slip right back into the fabulous career woman role with little to no turbulence?!? Vicki is right by our side to lend her shoulder and support, and to tell us (perhaps before we even realize it) that life keeps changing- you never pass a &quot;stage&quot; and get relative calm in your life. She uses the anaolgy of a leaky rowboat. You can either cry about the fact that you're up to your knees in water, or you can grab that bucket and bail the boat out, something you'll have to do again and again as eventually, the rowboat fills up again. Vicki helps us to see the humor in motherhood, and the unique role we play as women, but not in some drippy, &quot;I found this book in the self help section&quot; way. Every piece of advice is peppered with humor. Vicki explains how to focus at work when things at home are chaotic, that we should get over the romantic myth of &quot;date nights&quot;, and how to turn to your experienced girlfriends for help through what she calls &quot;mommy adolescence&quot;. A must for every mom.lp through what she calls &quot;mommy adolescence&quot;. A must for every mom.	2001-04-20

What a delight to find that the story is amusing and worth every penny. Chester is a mouse who does things his own way- he always eats the same thing for breakfast, he always uses hand signals when he rides his bike, and he never leaves the house without double-knotting his shoelaces. Chester's best friend's name is Wilson (my mother's maiden name- another delightful surprise!), and he and Chester are inseperable. When Wilson accidentally swallows a watermelon seed and cries because he's afraid he'll grow a watermelon in his belly, Chester swallows one too, so Wilson won't be alone in his predicament. This pair are like two peas in a pod...and then Lilly moves into the neighborhood. Lilly has HER own way of doing things, and Chester and Wilson avoid her like the plague. That is, until she scares of some neighborhood bullies trying to pick on Wilson and Chester. From then on, the three of them go everywhere together, and Chester and Wilson find that Lilly has many of the same interests that they do. An amusing and chuckle-out-loud story for all. Be sure to get &quot;Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse&quot;, too.	2001-04-15

Want to know how supermodels attack cellulite? They rub their morning coffee grounds into their problem areas; logic being, since caffeine is the largest ingredient in expensive cellulite creams, this is an inexpensive alternative. Got a big, angry red zit right before a date? Rub some Visine on it- it gets the red out of more than your eyes. How do supermodels' eyes look so rested and refreshed? Break out the Preperation H, my friend. The same &quot;Shrinking of hemmoroidal tissues&quot; can happen to puffy bags underneath your eyes, along the jawline, and on puffy cheeks. These, along with very cool fashion tips (&quot;How to Wear Pants&quot;, &quot;Do's and Don'ts of Shopping&quot;)and wrinkle fighting tips (sleep with a satin pillow- it won't pull your skin taught like fabric pillow, plus, you won't wake up with bed-head hair)are tips and ideas that Irons, a former model herself, has picked up along the years. She has great and realistic tips that you can actually apply and see results from. It's such a reasonably priced book, you can't go wrong. I refer to it all the time.	2001-03-07

Jackowski is an informed author	I found everything in this book to be quite interesting. Being a girl on a &quot;please let me be a size 4 naturally&quot; quest, I've explored every fitness regime out there imaginable. Edward Jackowski's makes sense. None of us have the same body, do we? Some people are taller than others; my sister, although being shorter than me, has longer legs whereas I have shorter legs but a longer torso. By the same reasoning, does it make sense that people who gain weight in different places should exercise the exact same way? What of you're particular bane is saddlebags? Will a stairmaster, designed to strengthen the quads and hamstrings, make you look slim and sleek, or build even more muscle in your problem area? These are the areas Jackowski's book attacks, and he gives us logical answers and solutions to our fitness problems. He doesn't offer a magic &quot;hey! Buy my book and instantly be thin!&quot; promise- he gives you the cold hard facts- if you don't exercise, you won't be fit. Plain and simple. However, he does offer a sort of shortcut by showing you exercises tailored to your particular fitness goals. This, desipte what one reviewer said, pertains to ANYONE, whether your goal is to tone and slim down or bulk up. How much $$$ have you wasted on lame exercise infomercial gear that is currently your dirty clothes hanger? If this is you, than $... is a bargain. Buy it!	2001-03-05
US	50964815	R2RY2JE9VVJNUV	0451409256	208908626	Making Minty Malone	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Fabulous- couldn't put it down	I bought this book based on the fact that other Amazon.com customers recommended it. Kudos, guys! As with &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; and &quot;Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married&quot;, I devoured this book in no time flat (which is saying something, since I have 2 kids under the age of 3 and rarely have quality reading time). Araminta- Minty, for short- is standing at the altar when her fiance Dominic answers the &quot;will you take this woman&quot; bit with a resounding &quot;no&quot;.  What is Minty to do after she watches him walk calmly out of the church and her life?  Take her 280 guests to the reception hall for a depressing dinner. Minty and her maid of honor decide to hightail it to the honeymoon suite in Paris to nurse Minty's broken heart and help her decide where to go from here. Little did Minty expect to meet handsome Joe, the London writer who is also on holiday.  Will she take Joe up on his offer to call her once they return home? What WILL this London FM reporter do now that Dominic has dumped and humiliated her? She'll take a good, hard look at her life, herself, and her bogus job where her co-corkers take advantage of her. She'll realize through &quot;The Nice Factor&quot; that being nice to a fault has led her to many of the circumstances she's in, and more importantly, she'll finally understand that being dumped by Dominic was the only good thing he ever did for her. A wonderful read, with many references (not the least of which is a phone-in call from Ms. Tiffany Trott herself- an added bonus to those who read Wolff's first novel &quot;The Trials of Tiffany Trott&quot;)you'll love and recognize. Enjoyable throughout!	2000-12-15
