It may also suffer from being overestimated by those sympathetic to those views.<br /><br />This is a collection of columns written by humorist Terry Jones, beginning in in 2001 shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, and leaving off after Iraq's provisional government was granted limited sovereignty in the summer of 2004.  Jones, known for his work with the Monty Python troupe and for his own books (including a controversial scholarly work on Chaucer), is a phlegmatic critic of the American Bush administration, and of the aid and comfort led to the American President by Prime Minister Tony Blair.<br /><br />The book ranges from satire, some of it brilliant; to sarcastic rimming; to editorial spleen (what one Amazon reviewer characterized as \\"whining\\").<br /><br />Interestingly, the book (and its perspective) are strongest with the satirical pieces.  \\"I'm Losing Patience With My Neigbors\\" was one of the funniest pieces of political humor to appear in 2003, written during the buildup to invasion of Iraq that year.  In this, as with \\"It's Not Really Torture,\\" Jones assumes the character of someone who adopts the logic of American policymakers in his normal relationships - sending up the fractured logic and twisted grammar of wartime in a way that is timeless yet, for our times, very pointed.  Don't think it's easy.<br /><br />The sarcastic pieces, \\"Bombing For  A Safer World\\" or \\"Colin Powell's Exploding English\\" play more for the converted, and while Jones is a very funny and analytical thinker, these columns become repetitive and tend towards commentary we have already heard.  Pieces like \\"Shame On Blair\\" are nothing more than letters to the editor - respectable enough, but not representing Jones's unusual talent and creativity as a satirist.<br /><br />My 4-star rating is in acknowledgment of the best that is in this little book, illustrated withpolitical cartoons by Steve Bell and perhaps padded out ever so slightly.  It remains a worthy volume of political humor with more than a dash of unabashed left-wing invective.	2005-02-12

Their continued pitfalls and escapes flesh out Terry Pratchett's amusing world while poking fun at the conventions of fantasy novels.  We meet satirical characters such as Cohen the Barbarian and a female warrior, the Henna-Haired Harridan.  This entry is fast-paced and unceasingly funny, although there is a barrage of jokes in the first third of the novel that slow down the pace.  (Jokes, even clever jokes, have a way interrupting the flow of a story.)  The tone does not allow for a great of suspense, but the story is thoroughly enjoyable and Pratchett's narrative voice does not fail to entertain.	2004-10-11

Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception	Books	3	20	32	N	N	This needs to be an educational series, not an attack	Author David Corn doesn't like George W. Bush.  He doesn't like him as a man, as a politician, or as President of the United States.  This passion is clear and unabashed throughout the book. <br /> <br />There is more to this book than editorializing and Bush-bashing, but at times it seems that a serious book about media manipulation, spin, Orwellian doublespeak, and sycophantic journalism, is wrestling to be heard over the author's personal disgust for the incumbent President.  Maybe the disgust is justified, but the book's potential languishes. <br /> <br />The treatment and analysis of the Bush government's lies, how he marketed himself as a candidate and how he has warmed the public to some outrageous policies, is important work.  One of the few hopes our Republic has is for the majority of eligible voters to listen to our politicians with intelligence, to insist that our news media serve as intelligence-gatherers for the voters, and hold our politicians accountable.   <br /> <br />Most of us expect that lying is the commerce of all politicians, but how many of us really question why we feel we have to accept that in a country such as this.  Every administration has its own litany of lies, and its own style.  Thus, I feel Corn has an excellent franchise on his hands: a Presidential series of lies, omissions, doublespeak and obfuscation.  Let Clinton be next.	2004-09-15

His secular parents, who own and operate a zoo populated with wild animals, are a little embarrassed, but Pi is unabashed: \\"I just want to love God.\\"  <br />  <br /> His story really begins in a shipwreck, after he finds himself in a lifeboat in the company of a few zoo animals. He survives 227 days, most of them in the company of a hungry, 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger. (A premise famously borrowed from another novel, but used for a wholly original story and work.) It is a story Pi claims will make one believe in God. It might, but when forced to give an alternative version of the events following the sinking of the ship and the loss of his parents, his story is put into a poignant new light suggesting that God, or the miracle of life itself, is an act of perception.  <br />  <br /> It is an absorbing, some might say addictive novel. It never drags - it grabs and does not let go, by turns playful and harrowing. This novel deserved its Booker prize and earns your attention. Highly recommended. <br />	2004-08-04

It doesn't matter of this is accurate and up-to-date, what is true is that Terry Pratchett and his DiscWorld novels are a major phenomenon in the UK and they are popular among American readers as well for their satirical wit, amusing reversals of old clichs, and hilarious characters.   <br /> <br />As the first in a long series, COLOR OF MAGIC pales next to some of the other novels (especially MORT) because the story devotes itself to exposition of the fabulous world in which these stories take place; the plotline wanders so as to take us to as many different parts of the world as possible.  We also make our first acquaintance with characters such as Rincewind, a second-rate wizard, an underachiever some of us might identify with more than a whiz-kid like Harry Potter.  The most unforgettable character here, no doubt, is the suitcase that walks around on its own legs - watch out, it bites, too.   <br /> <br />The DiscWorld's laws and geography are not consistent, since as Pratchett says, one cannot really map a sense of humor.  (That hasn't stopped someone from publishing a concurrence, but I'm sure it's all in fun.)  This is a wildly imaginative, intelligent, and hilarious introduction to a long, wonderful series of stories; the kind of reading that is great fun for adults and bright younger readers alike. <br />	2004-07-26

They show a great actor, the dean of Ealing comedies and (to his chagrin) the great Jedi Master, admiring the twilight in his retirement.  This is a gentlemanly, sensitive, yet vibrantly witty writer who once described heaven as sitting with one or two friends, sharing a drink and savoring the silence.  There are no peekaboo stories about celebrities or iconoclastic commentaries on the state of the world; just an appreciation for an interesting life well-lived, deliciously and intimately inscribed for us in these daily entries.<br />For a more organized and literary memoir, the two titles mentioned above come highly recommended.	2004-07-01

Although the long section relating the story of the campaign to defend him from Ayatollah Khomeini's death sentence is valuable, I was disappointed it did not include his own infamous public embrace and then disavowal of Islam.  Perhaps it is a moment he would rather forget, even though he could submit this as evidence of the fact that scripts were continually being forced upon him by various parties during his years in hiding.   There is even a darkly amusing echo here of Muhammad's disavowal of the so-called \\"Satanic\\" verses mentioned in a certain famous novel.  It is, however, an event that belongs in the record.  <br />Rushdie's views on the September 11 attacks and the war on terrorism (which is to some extent a war on violence wrought in the name of Islam) is surely of interest given his personal experience with radical Islamists.  Yet a contradiction in his moral reason appears over the course of his writing.  He upholds, as a basic principle of morality, the view that an individual is responsible for his murders no matter what his rationale is.  Hence, it is unacceptable to excuse terrorism on the basis of anti-Americanism.  On the other hand, Rushdie is willing to relieve individuals of personal blame in order to blame religion itself for murder.  He writes, \\"...religion is the poison in the blood... What happened in India, happened in God's name.  The problem's name is God.\\"  <br />If an individual kills for the sake of a totem, why is that God'sfault rather than the individual's?  Why is it okay to blame a person's religion, but not their politics?	2004-06-23

A change of attitude and a little meditation is not a panacea for a neurological disorder or psychological disorders induced by chemical processes.  Others who refer to \\"depression\\" refer to a generalized category of soul-numbing patterns of thought that suppress feelings and flatten one's inspiration, and it may feel out of control to one who has given up.  For the latter, Zen teacher Cheri Huber offers some suggestions for reframing one's experience of despair, fear, resistance, melancholy, existential fatigue - and turning it into a creative basis for awakening.  <br />The direction of the book is constructive and positive, and emphasizes on simple, practical meditation as the basis for untying those knots which are tied by none other than ourselves.  It is an important contribution to our attitudes about depression and encapsulates core Buddhist teaching with hardly a mention of the Buddha or Buddhism.  It is also fun to read, often hilarious, sensible - and unsparing.  One of the basic and essential works of this important modern guide.	2004-06-22

At one point, author Thomas Parrish's persnickety friend, the grammar hawk referred to in the title, likens a well-constructed sentence to an automobile engine.  Others may prefer Parrish's own analogy of a well-furnished room.  Automobile engines suggest a highly specialized knowledge, something intimidating for those without vocational training.  Pretty much anybody can set up a room that looks nice, however, and enjoy the results.  A well-furnished room is a room that has everything one might need while seeming empty and spacious.  Likewise, good prose has the feel not of something dense or impenetrable, but of something easy to apprehend quickly and digest.  Parrish assumes the persona of a reasonable go-between, someone moves easily between the grammatically-challenged and the scowling figure, imagined yet feared, of the lexical inquisitor.  The book is entertaining and reduces a lot of the mystery of grammatical usage.  I keep a copy of it, along with my Strunk &amp; White, right on my desk.	2004-05-25

This is not an introduction to meditation practice itself (that territory is amply covered elsewhere) but a look at a young community of practitioners findings its way, and the Way, in 21st century Detroit.<br />This community worked together on an adapted translation of the &lt;i&gt;Dhammapada&lt;/i&gt;, a much-beloved collection of sayings of the Buddha which provide day-to-day, moment-by-moment encouragement that it is possible to let go of greed, anger, and delusion, and live a life that lists to deep awareness and compassion like a current that carries an empty boat.<br />This is not merely a literary project, however.  This version of the &lt;i&gt;Dhammapada&lt;/i&gt;, which breathes with fresh language and terms easily acceptable to new students in the United States, comes to us through the personal practice of the members of this community, whom we get to know through the short, anecdotal chapters that follow each &lt;i&gt;canto&lt;/i&gt; of the text.  Ancient wisdom, and the bumpy business of everyday life, interact in something almost approximating parallel text.<br />So it is a window into a process, a process by which a new Zen community matures, and by which an American Buddhism is slowly taking form.  How wonderful to find this tradition finding its roots in our soil.	2004-05-03

At the beginning of the 1980's he agreed to do a regular column for the LA WEEKLY on the condition that they publish whatever he wrote, without revising it or suggesting rewrites.  He demanded, and got, the freedom to choose any target, no matter how sensitive to the paper's interests or its readership.  A wise editor agreed.  The results are collected in this volume.<br />His columns are not formally structured, but don't be misled into thinking these columns were easy.  He writes in a conversational voice, but it is that of a brilliant, nimble conversationalist.  Ellison cajoles, caresses, eulogizes, and excoriates.  The columns are witty and passionate, and evoke the tensions, the hopes and the lies, of the Reagan Era; of Hollywood, advertising, and journalism in that time; of Ellison's advocacy of the Equal Rights Amendment and gun control.  By turns, he is riotously funny, righteously indignant, and capable of issuing a devastating, fatwa-like call to outrage and democratic retribution.  <br />Ellison contends that we should dispense with the notion that every common person is entitled to an opinion; but that every person should be entitled to an informed opinion and the means to express it, as befits a citizen of this nation.  In this, it is call not only to outrage but to excellence.	2004-01-30

The story is based on an incident from the life of Henry David Thoreau.  Henry the bear is missing a shoe, and is on his way to the cobbler when he is stopped by the taxman and must spend a night in jail because he didn't pay.  In the jail cell, Henry starts to draw on the walls and gets lost on his creative landscape, hiking up a mountain he created and meeting a friend.  It is a beautiful, simple story that will provoke thoughtful questions.  There is, for instance, an act of civil disobedience and its consequence.  The breadth and power of imagination is also an important theme.  A turning point in the story follows an act of generosity.  Again, it is an entertaining story that may give you and a young reader lots to talk about together and for that it is highly recommended.	2004-01-16

It is especially good of him to include the sometimes-forgotten, but very influential, Giotto di Bondone.<br />Unfortunately, the book seems never to have gotten any quality attention from a copy-editor, as the book is loaded with a surprising number of grammatical mistakes, word omissions, and sentences with confused subjects.  It occurs frequently enough to degrade the overall quality of the book.<br />Barter also makes appreciative and detailed reference to several paintings, which are represented here only in black and white illustrations - and poor-quality reproductions, at that: small, very dark, and low on contrast.  Some, like photos of Da Vinci's \\"Adoration of the Magi\\" and \\"Last Supper,\\" are virtually invisible and almost a waste of space.<br />With all respect to the author, who did fine work presenting this period and its art to a middle-school aged audience, one can do better for the same amount of money.	2003-07-12

The book focuses more on the forces of personality in the family and the internal intrigues of the Signoria, the Vatican, and the Duchy, than on the changing conditions of europe or italia in general.	2003-06-30

Short novels have for some time been considered difficult to sell and to market, and when they do come out they are liable to received a mixed reception.  They allow more character development or more development of a single theme, but do not present the larger scope a longer novel affords.  As a result, there can be this feeling that nothing happens when, in fact, everything is happening.<br />This is the case in BEASTS, and the character of Gillian, a college student in the 1970's who writes poetry: competent, orderly, technically sophisticated poetry.  Her world is turned upside down when she falls in love with the intensely charismatic and hedonistic Professor Andre Harrow, who likes to blow up the walls of poetic forms - as well as conventional morality.   Along with his wild, powerfully sexual wife, he sometimes adopts his students as \\"interns.\\"  Gillian's straight-laced character is defined by her UNcharacteristic fascination with Harrow, with a very deft touch.  Through her, we explore the question of whether Harrow's hedonism and freedom is simply predation in an elegant guise.  Recommended.	2003-02-08

From his perspective, the variety of people, climates, and pressures in the middle-east are themselves a rich vein of humor and fascination.  Despite the laughter, this is also a serious recording of Horwitz's experience travelling across arabia: he views bodies in the Iraq-Iran war and explores Orwellian Baghdad; he crosses from Jordan to Israel; he attends what passes as a press conference with Qaddafi in Libya; he visits a weapons merchant in Yemen and haggles; and he spends time in the astonishing Khartoum, though while he's there what he thinks about mainly is how to get out of there.

The authors have arranged 74 brief &quot;points&quot; about daily life in Italy, alphabetically by subject, so the reader doesn't know what is coming next.  If you look at the sample pages available here, you will get a sense of the leaps: we begin with an explanation of the Italian version of April Fool's Day, followed by four paragraphs on table manners, and then we're on to &quot;attracting attention,&quot; and so on.  From the very way it's organized, we are clearly in the realm of entertainment, although the information is accurate and certainly useful.  There is a dusting of vocabulary, but it's not a course in Italian for travellers.  I found it a delightful and fascinating read.	2003-01-08

A state run by a mobster-type named Saddam Hussein, who has been demonized to a point where his political machine is, unwisely, forgotten - and where an entire nation of people are identified with a man who is ideologically very different.  <br />The bulk of this tiny book, however, is a lengthy interview with Scott Ritter, the former U.N. arms inspector in Iraq.  Ritter is a credible witness against current policy: he is a proud Republican who supported Bush in the 2000 election, who swears allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and feels that a compelling case for pursuing a war in Iraq has not been made.  Ritter wishes to educate Americans about the process of inspections which were cut off in 1998 because of manipulation and provocations of previous administrations - the look into this is fascinating.  Ritter asserts that Iraq was effectively disarmed by 1998, and that they could not have re-armed in such a short time and without detection (though he does not doubt Saddam would like to).<br />There is much to be learned from Ritter's experiences in Iraq and his criticisms of that process.  There are, to use the John Adams phrase that crops up frequently in the book, certain &quot;stubborn facts&quot; that shine a harsh light on the current party line on Iraq.  However, Ritter later moves into speculations about the future that are frightening but less substantiated.<br />In the interest of looking at &quot;stubborn facts&quot; and the need for the administration to make its case, an analysis and critique of the Bush Administration's case for disarmament and&quot;regime change&quot; to date would have fleshed this book out nicely.	2002-11-21

Hence, we are very afraid of someone tampering with halloween candy, which is an exceedingly rare event; but we don't look at the fact that families abuse their own children in surprising numbers.  Our attention is drawn away from systemic issues.  Perhaps our country is not as scary as it appears on the evening news.  However, there are people who profit from that perception.<br />Charging Glassner with a liberal bias (as several of the reviews here do) is a bit of a cheap shot, especially considering the fact that he frequently comes to the defense of major corporations, including commercial airlines and even the notorious Dow Corning, who were unjustly demonized because, well, that just made a better story.<br />The charge in one of these reviews that Glassner indicts the media for its conservative bias is off the wall.  Glassner makes no mention of it, other than an acknowledgement that some reporters belonging to corporate-owned news outlets MIGHT think twice about reporting on stories reflecting badly on parent companies.  That's not much of an indictment.<br />The scholarship is solid, and documented in copious footnotes using primary and reputable sources.  It is, however, written for the general reader in a style that is warm and humorous.  Recommended.	2002-11-05

This is crucial background material for any debate on the measures taken by the Bush Administration in response to terror.  <br />In addition, Chang has placed the USA PATRIOT Act in a historical context, reminding of us other cases in which our Republic has suspended common sense along with our democratic principles as a response to fear.  It is important to understand that Attorney General John Ashcroft did not invent preventive detention, and that George W. Bush is not the first president to resent elements of the Constitution he is charged to defend.<br />Dispassionately and tersely, Chang exposes the articles of the USA PATRIOT Act, the number of detainees and the treatment of non-citizens, the quest for authority to snoop on innocents and gather information on law-abiding citizens, the monitoring of conversations between client and attorney, the use of patriotism to demonize dissidents, and the unquestionable grab for power by the executive branch.  The book is high on information, including good documentary footnotes and solid research; and low on rhetoric.  This enhances its credibility and its strength in a time of confusion.	2002-09-25

She is a writer of considerable skill.<br />An elderly man is dying and talking to guests who are not there; his daughter, a famous country singer, is on a quest for a song she recalls hearing once in her childhood.  That song's journey is traced all the way from a pirate ship anchored off of Scotland to contemporary America.  To some, we may be hearing from too many ancestors by novel's end, but the song itself speaks of change, and we watch how the song changes, along with the American nation where it has arrived, and every story matters.	2002-09-21

This is a very skillfully made primer on our current predicament in America; this complicated arrangement of financial and political power which maintains a militaristic ideology and seizes a lion's share of our tax revenues, and more than an ounce of our spirit.  <br />Andreas provides a digest wtih verifiable quotes on every page, tracing the evolution of American militarism back to our colonial era and the doctrine of Manifest Destiny.  The book provides a historical outline and an analysis of our current situation (the new edition dates from immediately after 9/11), for the general reader to be able to understand and discuss our military policy.  Militarism, and the vital industry war has become for us, is still vastly misunderstood or ignored by most of the public, in spite of the central place the American military claims in our lives - even in peacetime.<br />So yes, this is highly recommended material.	2002-09-07

Cheri Huber is a contemporary Zen practitioner, student, and guide sharing insights and coming just short of giving advice or instruction; and the information is not &quot;Zen&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; as much as it is, simply, sound.  <br />This is an excellent, humorous, and enjoyably readable meditation on modern relationships and how to survive them; some ways in which we fail, and a suggestion of a way not to fail.  The suggestion is that, no matter how perfect the person we have found seems to be, they aren't; and neither are we.  The passion we are feeling, no matter how wonderful and exhilarating, does not offer us a waiver for understanding our true selves and doing the hard work of being with another person.<br />And yet, though we may call it &quot;work,&quot; it need not be somber or bereft of playfulness and spontaneity.<br />There are some basic instructions for sitting meditation and beginning an awareness practice, as well as a lot of &quot;right on&quot; observations about the pitfalls (and the hard teachings) of being in relationship.  Decorated with Cheri's characteristic doodles and sketches.  Highly recommended.	2002-08-07

Then, one's feelings about the book are likely to be swayed by one's opinion about that particular issue.<br />There is much more to this book, however.  It addresses themes far wider than our national debate on executions.  Sister Helen Prejean has written a gutsy account of lessons she has learned in ministry -- of plunging into unknown territory as a nun, of facing aspects of humanity that confuse her, frighten her, frustrate her -- and persisting in offering her Christ's forgiveness and love to every customer.<br />Her decision, for instance, to face the families of the victims of homicide, not to convert them but to listen to anything they offer and accept instruction from them, is courageous and moving.  <br />The book will not last because of its political position or because of any special literary merit; it will, I think, survive as a spiritual memoir and, perhaps, as a compelling argument for seeing even our worst offenders as human beings rather than monsters.	2002-08-02

It starts right from the stage where one is thinking about incorporating, and gives primers on the incorporation process, writing bylaws, choosing a board, effective and ineffective models of board governance, fundraising and strategic planning, grant-writing, the fiscal business you need to know about and stay on top of, and it even gives you a state-by-state rundown of the pertinent offices, laws, and other requirements.<br />Besides this, there are lean but meaty essays on corporate ethics, quality assurance, small business competition and the nonprofit sector, the pros and cons of coalitions, lobbying, and other political activity.   (There is also a chaper in the second edition on the Y2K problem - entertaining reading now.)<br />This information is organized so as to be highly accessible and helpful, and not intimidating.

The Oklahoma bomber is worth understanding on his own terms, and so are Randy Weaver, David Koresh, even Osama bin Laden (who most certainly had something to say to us).  Instead, such people are killed (Koresh and Weaver were killed without due process) and misrepresented by the justice system and a press that is free, but effectively monopolized.  What is the \\"national interest\\" that competes with understanding the motivation for militia groups, for \\"strikes\\" such as McVeigh's destruction of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City? <br />The real topic of Vidal's book is the national security state established in 1947 when Dean Acheson advised President Truman to \\"scare the hell\\" out of Americans about the Russians in order to justify an ongoing wartime budget that far exceeds mere \\"preparedness\\" into a cold assurance - and sells out the electoral system to corporate interests.<br />It is sad to finish this dissenting pamphlet, consisting of short writings on the military-industrial complex and our criminal justice system in light of the \\"war on terrorism\\" (along with several articles of our Bill of Rights).  It is sad to finish it and feel so uninspired.  Vidal, one of our finest writers and a credible voice from the left, should be able to build a compelling dissent based on fact, reason, and an appeal to our respect for the ideals expressed in our Constitution.  If anyone could reach a skeptical audience, surely Vidal could.<br />But this book is too easy.  It is very light on data (there are few footnotes, mainly references to more heavily researched material), not particularly well organized, and its tone is smug and cynical rather than earnest.  Instead of appealing to all thoughtful Americans, Vidal plays standup comic for the left with a relentless stream of wisecracks.  For one sympathetic to his point of view, and desiring serious dialogue on the issue, it is discouraging.  <br />Furthermore, personal prejudices are betrayed.  For instance, is there one reference to former FBI Director Louis Freeh that lacks an unflattering reference to his Catholicism (including jokes about hair shirts)?<br />Vidal practically begs to be mariginalized as an \\"extremist,\\" which only makes it easier to unplug our press feed.  We dissidents cannot afford to be snide; we must work hard for the moral ground.  We must compell and inspire.  (Think MLK, not Al Sharpton.)  It requires hope rather than cynicism and liberal despair.  It requires loving our foes, and finding the fuel companies, the CEO's, and the generals \\"well worth understanding.\\"	2002-07-16

Her first two collections of dharma talks (\\"Stumbing Towards Enlightenment\\" and \\"Tap Dancing In Zen\\") are inspirational: completely heartfelt, utterly acessible and entertaining for a general reader.  She is a single mom in Michigan who is also a serious student of Zen, such that when her teacher tells her she must shave her head for a pilgrimage in Korea, she does it - but prepares by consulting fashion magazines first.   No pretentious, other-worldly Zen here.    <br />This travelogue, in which she and an American dharma sister visit Korean temples along with their feisty master, is not Ally McBeal-goes-to-Asia: it is a plunge into the unknown.  Korea is still very much another world, and all of the confidence this Zen practitioner had accumulated on her home turf is quickly stripped away by the weather, the rough terrain, the austerities of the trip, and the severe corrections of her teacher and other glowering monks along the way.  <br />She likens the process to beating a shirt clean.  She is left not even with humility - everything is taken away, reduced to \\"don't-know\\" mind:  \\"The longer and more arduous the trip, the more your heart has a chance to open up until finally, in a moment of utter exhaustion, you realize that's all of you that is left - the heart part.  Your mind has disappeared - the one that judges and gets mad and worries and thinks and fantasizes.  Instead you are in love with your life, whatever it is.  And the whole world is your family with the earth playing the lead role as universal nest, one you are thrilled to share with all takers.  I almost forgot.  You'll also lose ten pounds without even trying.\\"<br />But holding on to that isn't it, either.  The most wonderful thing this book offers (aside from some choice stories, one of the best being the elderly monk in the mountains who demonstrates how a soccer ball is the best exercise machine you will ever need) is an open-hearted account of a sincere student finding the real faith in practice, in which losing it is getting it and all the merit is given away.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-01-30

He is, however, a recognized world leader with a tremendous following.  When he gave a public talk in the east meadow of New York's Central Park in 1999, a crowd of 200,000 turned out.  <br />This book begins with that talk, in which he endorses a spiritual ethics based on one spiritual truth we all share: that human beings are often unhappy, and that we all aspire to be happy.<br />The chapters that follow are good introductory lectures to a Buddhist technique (which does not require, in fact discourages, any departure from another faith).  He sticks closely to the subject matter, and uses stories and humor only to help illustrate the more abstract teachings.  <br />A strong  'dharma candy' he uses to inspire us is this happiness.  That surely draws many people to the dharma: a hope for improvement, in ourselves or our situation; a sense of incompleteness.  Now you, too, can frustrate your oppressors by keeping your equilibrium and your smile.  There are dangers in taking such an idealistic approach, but by the end, even those goals that brought us to the cushion are kindly brought into the light and examined for what they are.	2002-01-30

It's a holistic way to view history, creating wide sketches of the context of the periods he visits, but Burke never belabors the point.

Cheri Huber, who trained in the Soto tradition and has a very distinctive, insightful style, takes this even further: the precepts are not rules at all, they are doorways onto your personal practice, to identifying the deepest beliefs about existence which we defend, and an opportunity for genuine self-expression as we let this go (as opposed to defending my persona, as my conditioning has taught me).  <br />A wonderful quality of the book is the willingness to present the students' struggles and frustration with respect for the process of the retreat.

One British journalist went so far as to write, in a comment on Rushdie's sudden relocation to America, that this routine award-winner was only defecting because no one in England was buying his &quot;lousy&quot; books anymore.  <br />FURY is not his finest.  It lacks Rushdie's distinctive style, a storytelling voice that bubbles and delights with wordplay and dances with idioms in English and Hindustani.  It is eclipsed, here, by another agenda: a self-conscious anxiety to prove familiarity with American culture.  Malik Solanka's, and probably author Rushdie's, view of New York City is limited to the privileged neighborhood he frequents - and the understanding of American culture feels compressed, a digest of America via CNN and the Entertainment Channel.  Intellectually, we are being fed fast food here.  The observations of American life are facile: the USA does not consider the consequences of its policies; capitalism is a fanatical religion; men are afraid of women's sensuality; America has race issues.  Rushdie's critical analysis rests on shallow observations (well, after all, he is new in town).<br />The novel sets up a confrontation with a deep, mysterious anger - an eternal human rage - that disappears in an unsatisfactory perfume of sentimentality.  &quot;Love conquers all,&quot; and so we are left to chew on a rather strained fantasy about a fictional civil war, and an uninteresting remnant of Solanka's science-fiction story.	2001-10-31

Somewhere along the way, at a professional conference, an expert is asked to define depression; after a looooong, thoughtful pause, the expert says, &quot;Depression is knowledge.&quot;<br />This is a courageous and beautiful memoir positing a different attitude to a condition which is increasingly pervasive in our society, and yet hard to define exactly.  By exploring his experience spiritually and historically, not just as clinically, Smith offers many ways to view depression and, hence, many possibilities for accepting what it may be showing us.	2001-09-21

The character of physicist Mark Perdue and the condo he shares with his new wife (still permeated with &quot;new Mazda&quot; smell - the condo, that is) is beautifully wrought, with conflicting desires and interests, an infantile boredom sitting on top of a metaphysical question which begins to find expression after a sleepless night defending property lines with his unlikely neighbor, Roger.  <br />The novel bravely walks a line with its satirical view of NoCal suburbia, and the beer-lubricated choices made by two very different, rather eccentric men in a backyard that is still a dirt-covered lot scored by tractor trails; and it takes us into some truly farcical territory without losing its credibility or Mark Perdue's hidden longing.  Recommended.	2001-09-16

Woven into the stories and details are comparisons of post-modern art and ideas to the medieval worldview, lightened with good humor and a certain humility to both the Middle Ages and the modern world.  No academic bore, this man.<br />However, there are some missed opportunities.  The premise is not very strong because &quot;Jim's&quot; feelings about being &quot;a medieval man&quot; are not explored in much personal depth.  <br />Also, a visit to a John Cage exhibit fizzles when the author fails to compare the medieval beliefs about fate with John Cage's fascination with &quot;chance operations.&quot;  Instead, the chapter hinges mostly on jokes about no one understanding the art. <br />This pleasant and readable novel ends without any sense of dramatic arc: there is no substantial change in the author's behavior, or his perception of the modern world or the Middle Ages.  The reflections of Los Angeles are those of a visitor, not a native.  No one else in the story is affected by these ruminations (and occasional tangents).  The result is kind of like a witty slide show of someone's vacation, and at other times there is a very lonely sense of a brain churning away in isolation while his friends are tasting the wine and feeling the sand between their toes.	2001-09-10

It may even be the equivalent, for American Zen Buddhism, of Thomas Merton's SEVEN STORY MOUNTAIN - although there are no signs Matthiessen will later distance himself from his autobiography, as Merton did.<br />As a spiritual autobiography, it is magnificently compelling.  It is some of Matthiessen's finest prose, and he writes with complete openness about the cruel death of his wife, Deborah Love (who became a Zen student while he looked on skeptically, only later trying zazen for himself), his own demons, and his practice without imposing on the reader.  It is a fine model of autobiographical writing.<br />It is also a valuable document of the planting of the Zen seed in America.  Matthiessen begins as a student of Eido Shimano Roshi in New York, and provides a truthful and valuable portrait of that sangha as they built the Dai Bosatsu monastery and established one of the major places of Zen training in the United States.  Later, Matthiessen becomes a student of Bernard Glassman and the portrait of their friendship as well as the beginning of their student/teacher rapport is such a gift.<br />Finally, this provides maybe the best portrait in print of what it was to sit retreat with Soen Roshi, the Japanese roshi and renowned haiku artist who defies brief descriptions.  (Other accounts do exist: to some extent in ENDLESS VOW, a collection of Soen's haiku; and in the New York Zen Studies Society's SOEN ROKU.)<br />This is highly suited for people already practicing, but Matthiessen provides plenty of background material on Zen Buddhism as well as his own introduction to the practice, such that any general reader can appreciate and enjoy this marvelous work.	2001-08-08

But it is not, and the author is open about that in his introduction: &quot;...I have...paraphrased, expanded, contracted, interpreted, worked with the text, played with it, until it became embodied in a language that felt genuine to me.&quot;  <br />Some of the ire this book has aroused may have to do with packaging.  It is not Lao-Tzu's Tae Te Ching, and students seeking to become more familiar with that text had best consult other, more literal translations.  Comparison and contrast with Mitchell's work is highly recommended, however, because Mitchell's version is informed by a deep understanding, nurtured by years of spiritual practice and Zen training, and the author's own considerable skill as a poet.	2001-07-31

IMPRO is a book not only about theatre and improv, but about teaching and human interaction, loaded with insights making that book highly suitable for the general reader.<br />This follow-up is more specialized: a handbook for putting IMPRO into practice, including detailed improv structures for performance and for rehearsal, and chapters on how to teach these games.  Sample run lists and notes from performances impart Johnstone's experiences, trials and errors over many years teaching in several countries.  The book is exhaustive and beautifully written, but for the general reader, IMPRO is more appropriate.<br />One disappointment about the book is some sloppy copy-editing.  It is rife with typos, of the sort that are not picked out by a computer spell-checker since the typos form actual words.  <br />The title IMPRO FOR STORYTELLERS is, as Tim Sheppard pointed out below, potentially misleading.  This is not a book that will help a solo performer generate material, though some of the exercises within can be translated for that purpose.  Johnstone's concern is that improv not be restricted to a form of &quot;light entertainment&quot; (think &quot;Who's Line Is It Anyway?&quot;), but as a way of generating narrative and using it to explore human relationships.	2001-07-25

Rushdie spent several years in hiding.  His marriage did not survive, and in the separation and divorce, Rushdie (an unwilling hermit) lost contact with his young son, Zafar.  This novel, his first novel after SATANIC VERSES, is dedicated to his son.<br />The story is about a celebrated storyteller (&quot;the shah of blah&quot;) who loses his talent for improvising stories when his wife leaves him.  Haroun, his son, is unwillingly pulled into an adventure involving an arduous journey to the sea of stories to vanquish a powerful enemy and reclaim his father's gift of gab.  <br />What is the force of evil in this story?  Silence.  An enforced silence.  The quashing of language, fantasy, satire - even the truth itself.  Something Rushdie was experiencing in an episode much darker and more terrifying than any of the events in this joyful fable.<br />There are plenty of allegories and light-hearted commentary woven into the tapestry.  The braying and strident Princess Batcheat is a bit much to put up with - as are the people we must sometimes defend on principles such as freedom of expression.   <br />Written beautifully, with a masterful feel for language punning in English and Hindustani.  Try reading it out loud.  This is suitable for the young dreamers in your family, but that is not to underestimate the maturity of this work.  It could only have come out of Rushdie's experience at that time, an incomprehensible event with severe personal costs.  Out of that sadness, he opened his mouth and something joyful and indomitable appeared.	2001-07-25

A confusing distinction made in these talks, especially the &quot;Outline,&quot; has to do with what Bodhidharma calls &quot;reason&quot; (again, in this translation) and meditation practice.  They are presented as two avenues to &quot;zen,&quot; but the definitions make it hard to distinguish them.  Throughout, there is an inside/outside (or mind/body) kind of thinking which may be expedient thinking for the sake of his students, or his own enduring mind-habit.<br />Otherwise, his teaching is very clear: attain your true self, attain what the Heart Sutra is talking about; and at that point, what is there to do?  Realizing the paramitas without a trace of actor or action, the student can use form with a clear mind and help others.<br />In the &quot;Bloodstream Sermon,&quot; there are questions and answers, as Bodhidharma teaches and occasionally spars with monks in China (at a time when Buddhism in China was heavily philosophical).  Bodhidharma has mastered the philosophy enough to turn it on its ear and make it point these sleepy students to &quot;just doing it.&quot;  If you do not find your true self, he says, all invocations, offerings and precepts are useless.  &quot;The thousands of sutras and shastras only amount to a clear mind.&quot;<br />With the &quot;Breakthrough Sermon,&quot; the conceptualizing gets pretty convoluted.  Dharma speeches are like acupuncture needles, and what may have pointed directly 1,500 years ago becomes mysterious.  This talk refers to the Nirvana Sutra and the Sutra of theTen Stages, which were revolutionizing Buddhism in China.  <br />It is interesting to watch how Bodhidharma intercepts questions which are often reverently Buddhist and spin them around to the three poisons (anger, greed, delusion) and their need to practice just now.  And yet one might wonder that even as he criticizes external devotions, he seems to be making something special about &quot;inner&quot; work and enlightenment.  Is there such thing as practice without inside and outside?	2001-07-23

The oddest couple ever - an impulsive American poet and an elderly Chinese Buddhist monk - set out on an improbable journey into Mongolia and Hong Kong to locate his late master's bones and conduct a proper ceremony over them.  <br />The back story is astonishing.  This elderly monk escaped the Red Army as it marched on his monastery in 1959.  He fled across thousands of miles during a period of intense famine - at one point clinging to a train through a tunnel so narrow it scraped the skin off his knuckles.  He left his teacher behind to cope with the revolution.  George Crane's account of that escape is vivid and, at times, horrifying. <br />What else is wonderful about this book?  The relationship between the writer and the monk, Tsung Tsai, is established with their meeting in Woodstock, New York, and steeped in their shared love of life and language.  To read of them working together intensely to translate poetry from Chinese into English, catching one poet's appreciation and giving it like a precious gift to another language, is another rather miraculous event in the book.	2001-07-16

For some, a criterion of great art is: it makes you feel creative.  Reading Groucho's letters makes one look around for pen and paper.  <br />It is a pity Groucho Marx's prose isn't better known, because it was quite good.  He found a voice all his own, with due influence or inspiration from Robert Benchley and, most certainly, S.J. Perelman.  <br />This collection of letters ranges from warm and teasing, to wry and satirical, to scathing (a section entitled &quot;Short Shrift&quot; showcases letters designed to sting and fly away, like a wasp).  Yet throughout, Marx's wit is belied by a language that is literate and witty but uses an ordinary vocabulary.  They reflect the man himself, who had a third-grade education and hit the books in later years.  His willingness to address himself to unknown corporate officers, well-known politicians, or to put on a major film studio work the way much of Groucho's humor worked: he comes from the level of the ordinary person, caring not a whit for ceremony or status; and he is willing to talk circles around just about anybody, to their vexation and our delight.	2001-07-12

Part of their operation is to find the antichrist child (and his little yipping hellhound) before the four motorcyclists of the apocalypse (along with some mortal tagalongs) find him.  <br />A lot of humor and joy is found in mediocrity.  There is a book of utterly accurate prophecies by a witch who, all those centuries ago, didn't quite understand what her visions of VCR's and current events actually meant.  There is a motley witch-hunter, and a hellhound embarrassed to manifest as a tiny, domesticated yapper.<br />As the story turns suspenseful, the narrative can get frustrating.  You don't want to miss one word of the exposition and character development - which often includes hilarious footnotes - and there is a feeling of being yanked out of the action as the chase is on and time begins to run out.	2001-07-11

Disgruntled with the ecclesia of the time, he established a retreat society and set down a range of practice techniques which are still taught.  He also did his best to address the schism between sutra study and meditation practice.<br />Robert Buswell, himself a practitioner and former monk, renders translations of Chinul's &quot;Secrets On Cultivating the Mind,&quot; &quot;Straight Talk on the True Mind,&quot; and excerpts from Chinul's &quot;Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record with Personal Notes&quot; that are accessible, challenging to the general reader, and - for the practitioner - a long finger pointing us to our own mind.<br />This is not, however, practice-oriented material, so the Zen student looking for encouragement in practice will not find much &quot;dharma candy&quot; here.  With Buswell's extensive introduction, the book offers us a history of Buddhism in Korea, a biography and extensive critique of his philosophy and methods, in addition to the translations.  This offers some edifying history to a Zen student with a scholarly bent, but with this caveat: these are dead words!  They were set down at a certain time as medicine for the kinds of dharma sickness Chinul confronted.  Don't let this old medicine become a disease!	2001-07-11

John Julius Norwich recounts the stories of the English monarchs through the Middle Ages alongside Shakespeare's dramatizations, noting the liberties taken by the Bard with an appreciation for his dramatic art.<br />There are gaps in Shakespeare's histories, some of which may soon be filled.  EDWARD III has found acceptance as being at least partially Shakespeare's work, and a defense is being prepared for a more recent find which, if it holds up as being some or all of Shakespeare's work, amounts to a RICHARD II PART 1 (whereas the RICHARD II already in the canon starts so late in his reign).  <br />Norwich fills in those gaps with a history that, while immensely readable and briskly-paced, suffers from such a density of information.  We are given helpful maps of England and France and charts showing us the descent of the various houses, but the general reader may still be overwhelmed by the concentration of the middle ages into such a neat paperback.<br />&quot;...To a dramatist,&quot; Norwich writes, &quot;accuracy is at most of secondary importance...The average playgoer...will have come away with a mental picture which, for all its bold lines and high color, will not be so very far wrong.&quot;  This idea and the potential for controversy (especially with respect to the much-maligned Richard III) might be within the scope of the book, but are not fully examined here.  What is the merit of theatre as a historical medium?  Given the necessity of combining, omitting, or even fabricating events, how does a play convey an accurate experience of history, and how does it fail?	2001-07-10

Even for ten minutes a day.  Suddenly that ten minutes seems utterly precious and needed for some other activity.  The resistance can manifest itself in numberless doubts and questions, which we invest in and thus feed our belief in our own inadequacy.  <br />Cheri Huber won't let us get out of it that easily.  Here she is  in her conversational, humorous style, answering some of the most frequently-asked questions about starting and maintaining a regular practice of sitting meditation.  Her answers are direct, to the point, and unsparing.  She addresses each question generously and practically, while also calling attention to the potential resistance underlying each of them.	2001-07-09

The power of Wilber's analytical thinking could overpower this book, were it not for two of the book's strengths: one, the extent to which his deceased wife is allowed to speak for herself, through her poetry, art, and journal excerpts (all of which she authorized for publication); and two, the author's palpable admiration of and humility before the memory of his wife: a woman who provided inspiration and guidance to many people through her research, advocacy, and sincere spiritual practice.<br />Ken Wilber, already noted for his early works on transpersonal psychology and contemporary philosophy, and Terry Killam fell deeply in love upon their first meeting and were quickly engaged.  Right away, she was diagnosed with cancer which proved to be persistent and aggressive.  The book which emerges is amazing: a tribute to a person who, in the words of one friend, taught people how to live and how to die, by strong example; it is also a cogent examination of different approaches to illness, with a refreshingly open perspective to orthodox and New Age paths alike; a book about dying, and about being a caretaker; a bare-bones, courageous examination of maintaining a strong marriage in the face of something unthinkable; a book about illness, dying, and practicing the dharma not only for one's own healing, but for the benefit of all beings.<br />The book itself is pretty clearly the product of a healing process, and it has so many gifts to offer.

The original outline, handwritten by Zen Master Seung Sahn for use by his students, touches on the central points of Buddhist teaching and practice.  An eminent roshi once examined it and confirmed that this is all a student need study.  <br />Yet Zen Master Seung Sahn always points the reader back to practice, practice, practice.  This practical orientation is present in every one of these assembled talks.  ZMSS clearly has a solid understanding of Buddhist sutras as well as non-literary Zen insight, and presents it in a clear, direct, straightforward teaching style.  The book is also full of wonderful Korean stories and the Zen Master's own humor.  Consistently, he will  undercut the scholarly approach to Zen and exhort the listener to return to everyday life practice (&quot;just do it&quot;) and a sincere vow to help all beings.<br />So, a thick book isn't necessary.  At some public talks in America, when asked about this or that point in the book, Seung Sahn Sunim has even said, &quot;Maybe book make mistake.  Throw book away.&quot;	2001-07-03

This is an irony the wilderness student is familiar with, and so is the spiritual practitioner.<br />THE WILD WITHIN is a book about tracking, and a delightful record of an enthusiastic and engaging teacher.  It is also a very open yet unassuming autobiography, including the author's experiences as leader of a motorcycle gang, yoga student, and now ardent outdoorsman.  His spiritual insights are without denomination or zeal, and do not intrude in the slightest upon his tribute to the natural world and the wonders it holds for anyone who will walk softly and listen.<br />The first meeting of a stalking seminar begins when students arrive at the location to find Rezendes's jeep baring a sign that reads, &quot;Your program has begun.  You must find your instructor.  He is watching you.&quot;  Students poke around for quite a while, but they cannot find a man who is sitting no more than ten feet away, watching from a thicket.  Even when they  nearly step on him.  Even when he shouts &quot;Turkeys!&quot; at them.  Rezendes writes, &quot;Everything we ever need to learn, if we want to know deeply who we are, if we want to know what keeps us from connecting with nature, is all here in front of us all the time.  All we have to do is pay attention...&quot; and observe how, as his students learned in this instance, how certain thought habits keep us out of our sensory awareness and separate us from our own life.	2001-07-02

(Foreman, you see, doesn't start out with characters, per se, and distributes the lines during his rehearsal process.)  <br />Your correspondent is among those who feel Richard Foreman's work is highly visionary and way ahead of our time.

There is plenty to like about this play by Jeff Baron, who has written more for television and film.  The premise, in which a young corporate man is compelled by a judge to make regular visits to an elderly Jewish man he struck with his car, is loaded with opportunities for character conflict and humor.  Initially the men, who are of different generations and different attitudes about their &quot;Jewishness,&quot; are so badly matched the playwright has to cash in some disbelief credit to keep the arrangement going.  The terms of their friendship tug at the heartstrings with the neatness and economy of a television 'dramedy.' <br />If you ask more than this of an evening of theatre, for perhaps a deeper and more surprising exploration of a dramatic theme, you will find the water shallow here.  Moreover, the playwright's orientation toward film and video shows via some unwieldy scene changes.  At one point, the playwright orders the hopelessly cluttered apartment to be spic and span after a blackout between scenes - not after an act break, which would be more practical.  The camera can do that; in theatre, we have to move things around in real time.<br />The dialogue is quick, lean, and pretty funny.  It might be a wonderful television special, and is much closer to a teleplay than dramatic literature.	2001-06-27

This is a wonderful companion for the student chef - and very much worth a little time tracking a copy down second-hand.  (The book is, sadly, out of print.)  <br />The book is so friendly and accessible, with early editions including amateurish drawings and hand-printed messages, with such a playful (while certainly informative) tone, there is no intimidation.  At the front of the book is a good orientation on knife care and safe chopping, as well as different styles of chopping (the &quot;julienne&quot; versus the &quot;round cut,&quot; for example).  The book is then organized into food groups, with chapters on basic ingredients essential for healthy (and tasty) vegetarian cooking.  The facts about each vegetable, legume, or grain, and some very basic recipes to show how it might be prepared - with a strong encouragement to improvise!	2001-06-26

Will we ever understand why this wild Korean monk came to America to teach Americans the dharma, or how he made it to Providence and worked at a laundramat with great faith that students would find him?  As he slowly (and imperfectly) learned English, he found a straightforward, unmystical, humorous but relentless teaching of Zen Buddhism for ordinary Americans.  You may even find you do not apprehend his teaching so much as recognize it like something you used to know but forgot.<br />This is an excellent book for someone new to Zen, on a cognitive level.  There is no meditation instruction, so for nuts and bolts about sitting posture you will have to look elsewhere (or, better still, go to your nearest Zen Center and get some instruction).	2001-06-25

(The teaching letters of Ta-Hui come to mind...)  But has there ever been a more prolific correspondent?  Until recent years, Zen Master Seung Sahn would answer every letter students or perfect strangers sent him, and bundles of letters would chase him from city to city as he flew around America in the seventies and eighties, teaching wherever the airlines would take him.<br />As far as Zen books go, it's good teaching with very little obscure dharma language.  His talent was talking about Zen in a way non-scholarly Americans could understand and apply to their own lives.  It's a lively collection of letters from a wide spectrum of students: from the sincere to the smart-aleck to the earnest and to the clueless.  The teacher meets them all on their level, sometimes with very long letters including stories and koans.  <br />Due to his concentrated, concise teaching style, the reader may find the letters repetitive.  (When asked why he says the same thing over and over again, he has replied, &quot;Did you hear it?&quot;)  Some of the student letters may wear out their welcome, but they belong with the responses.  Bear with it: there is good teaching throughout.	2001-06-23

Whereas the latter was strictly a selection from his diary, with this Guinness moves beautifully from journalistic descriptions of day-to-day events (from eye surgery to walks with his wife, Merula, to the indignities of moving slowly in an ever fast-paced and impolite world) and wry reflections on current events to anecdotes spanning his entire career in theatre and film.  Each chapter is arranged by a theme, mostly seasonal, but they meander charmingly.<br />Those interested in his encounter with the church and his beginnings as an artist should find his autobiography, BLESSINGS IN DISGUISE.  Those who might want reflections on STAR WARS will be disappointed.  When one gentleman asked Guinness for an autograph from Ben Kenobi immediately after mass, Guinness admonished him, &quot;Not in front of the parishioners!&quot; and disappeared as nimbly as a young Jedi.	2001-06-23

He lived a very simple life and taught only indirectly, by eating when he ate and wasting nothing (he would even save little pieces of foil, folding them up very neatly and putting them away).  The author's often hilarious anecdotes about this man point us directly to the meat of our practice, letting the air out of spiritual pretension and connecting very simply and sweetly to our life just now.	2001-06-21

The true story of the construction of this cathedral, including its astonishing dome, is foolish and wonderful.  The emergence of Brunelleschi and his competition with Lorenzo Ghiberti (who produced the amazing doors of the Baptistery, where a replica now stands) serves as a story which shows the creativity but also the competitiveness and vanity of a time that is often romanticized.  <br />Laymen interested in the mechanical details of Brunelleschi's groundbreaking machines and designs may find themselves up against the limits of their imagination, as the book restricts itself to prose descriptions and relies on period drawings to illustrate the mechanics.	2001-06-21

Hornby's revolt is against a certain conception of acting which the author blames on Lee Strasberg; and against the conception of actor-training as being primarily vocational.  What of theatre as a humanity?  Considering the rate of unemployment in theatre, should we not rethink our motives in training people in theatre?  Hornby does a skillful job of confining the scope of his book to American theatre, in spite of the questions he raises about psychology and emotionality.<br />In his critique of Strasberg's method and teaching, Hornby may be faulting the teacher for the work of those who followed him (the way some have blamed Stanislavsky for what they didn't like in Strasberg).  He may be over-generalizing about how American actors box themselves into outmoded Freudian conceptions of psychology and dualistic approaches to the work.  <br />On the other hand, there is much to value in his call for production-oriented training programs and for teaching acting as a humanity more than as a career.  Here the reader may find his numbers and his criticisms dated; also, he strangely has little to say about training actors to generate their own work.	2001-06-20

With the number of theatre programs for teenage actors growing, there is a need for good plays for young people to work on.  The American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco is helping this cause by commissioning quality plays for young actors with substantial characters in their own age range!  (After all, teenagers are interesting people, too, and certainly face conflicts comparable to the highest drama!)<br />This volume includes a play by a Hispanic playwright, a collection of scenes about high school life (&quot;Class Action&quot;) which are inventive and funny if sometimes laboring for a message, a play revisiting America in 1968, and a wonderful piece by Pulitzer-winning Paul Zindel, &quot;Every Nineteen Minutes The Crowd Goes Crazy,&quot; a dark comedy written with some collaboration by the young artists - which must have been a mind-blowing experience for the lucky company.  &quot;Class Action,&quot; by the way, might also be useful for the acting teacher looking for scenes to assign teenagers.<br />Also included are journal excerpts and statements by young actors who worked on these plays, which does not shed much light on the process or do more than promote A.C.T.'s program.  Production photos might have made for a better appendix.	2001-06-20

Cheri Huber has a talent for concise, clear demonstrations of practicing in ordinary life and how to make room for daily meditation practice. Instead of ancient Buddhist teachings, she is more likely to reach to common sense and a warm, keen feeling for psychology. Her style as a Zen teacher is refreshingly ordinary, modest, and worldly. She is loath to offer prescriptions, and has a sharp eye for how spiritual practice may be co-opted by egotistical concerns. <br><br>Editor Sara Jenkins has bravely allowed these talks to stand without explanation or qualification, respecting the power of a short paragraph over a lengthy discourse. The book is organized into categories that almost seem irrelevant as one is tempted to simply dip into the book!, opening at random and letting one talk at a time be enough for the day.	2001-06-20

He outlines his method in beautiful detail, like a workbook.<br />Wonderful, as far as it goes.  Colyer's teaching is squarely in the tradition of Lee Strasberg, and his workbook emphasizes emotional work over other important aspects.  There is an approach that rejects what may be called &quot;artificial&quot; (but could still be theatrical!).  It remains to a large extent dualistic about an actor and emotions, as if an actor may at a given moment be having a &quot;wrong&quot; emotion or none at all.  Also, with its frankness about marketing (which divides people into either/or categories such as &quot;lead&quot; versus &quot;character&quot;), one should not heed too well the advice to accept the divisions and define oneself by the gaze of the casting director.	2001-06-19

Yoshi Oida discusses eastern techniques for the western artist, putting western ideas about acting into relief and offering useful tools.  Some may find discussions of technique only whet the appetite for what the book does not offer - a more systematic approach to working on character, text, and partner work.  The book serves more for inspiration than training, though Oida does make many practical suggestions for warming up and preparing for the work.  Oida has the background and experience - especially his work with Peter Brook's truly international theatre - to transcend east and west; and his love for the craft of acting, for precision as well as freedom, make this required reading for acting students and teachers.	2001-06-19

Many artists who have not yet heard of this book are doing exercises based on his experiments in England with actors using improvisation to discover status operations within a scene, narrative structure, and the importance of structure and process over &quot;content&quot; (a sticking point for the improvisator, the public speaker, and everyone who has ever said, 'I can't think of anything.')  It also provides one of the best short introductions to mask work around.  So it might seem like an indispensable theatre book.  And it is that.  Indispensable.<br />Yet read Johnstone's first chapter - a memoir of his early teaching career, in which he discovered the process by which children learn to be uncreative as a tragic coping skill.  This is not a theatre book.  Theatre classes were the arena, but this is a book about teaching!  This is about opening doors that have been slammed shut, and acquainting people with the creativity and exuberance that is everybody's birthright.  The exercises, and analyses of his students' work with improvisation, along with Johnstone's unflagging faith in every person's imagination, have much to show us even on repeated readings and practice.	2001-06-19

In rehearsal, Foreman creates an environment rebelling against any mimetic presentation of everyday reality, which is a kind of shared dream.  He uses every theatrical element at his disposal to surprise and dazzle the spectator, and bring awareness to our radical impulses before our intellects &quot;understand&quot; them (and change them into something else).<br />Although his project sounds very cerebral, his theatre is very much about the senses, and his art grabs you on a gut level.<br />The book includes several plays, though it might have been helpful to include a script without the production stage directions to help understand the way he generates a script.  (A later book, MY HEAD WAS A SLEDGEHAMMER, does include this and it helps a great deal.)  Also, more photographs and illustrations would support his essay on visual design and use of space.<br />This artist is way ahead of his time, using theatre to address the process of perception itself rather than narrative thinking.  The importance of this book, addressing this work to a general reader, may not be appreciated for quite some time.	2001-06-19

In this slim, handsome volume (sporting the most beautiful photograph of Suzuki-roshi I have seen - like a sunbeam!) long-time students and practitioners recall moments with their teacher who showed, by example, that when you digest spiritual practice - so that how you hang your laundry is the teaching! - then THIS is the real teacher.  When one student asks for a translation of one ancient Japanese chant, the roshi waves away an attendant who begins to locate a helpful book and says, &quot;It means love!&quot;<br />This is not wiseguy, shoot-from-the-hip Zen; nor is it a collection of erudite dharma speeches drawn from ancient scripture.  This is a tribute to a true dharma friend and guide, a kind of friend we feel lonely for until we realize he was only showing us who we are.	2001-06-19

This much is an achievement.  However, the throughline of St. Nadie feels underdeveloped, and much of the poetry did not move me.  For readers who have read other books on Zen, the &quot;Zen memoir&quot; aspect will be very familiar without any new angle on the teaching or its realization in everyday life.	2001-06-18

For many new students investigating Zen Buddhist practice, the dialogues of ancient Zen students with their teachers - many of which are cited in cases known as &quot;koans&quot; - seem inscrutable. CAVE OF TIGERS is a wonderful gift to us. It records public dialogues (or &quot;dharma combat&quot;) between students of contemporary master John Daido Loori at Zen Mountain Monastery in New York State. The dialogues are dynamic, spontaneous, and full of the spirit of moment-to-moment practice with a keen-eyed teacher. It demonstrates that the koan is nothing other than our life, now.	2001-06-18
