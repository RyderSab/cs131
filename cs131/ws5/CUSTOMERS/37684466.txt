They usually can't think very clearly and are so determined that they're right that conversation is useless. <br />I'm sure in 1933 in Germany many people wanted to understand<BR>the SA brownshirts.

Unlike most other books in the genre, The Bush Boom is smart and informed, it avoids selectively choosing facts that artificially make the author's points seem clearer than they are, and it does not rely on comedy as a substitute for insight and intelligence. <br />Bravo to authors Bowyer and Kudlow for creating the first political book I've seen this season that is at once honest enough, well researched enough, and also well written enough that it can target an audience that stretches far beyond the usual policy wonks and think tankers. The authors somehow manage to be angry and sensible at the same time, no easy trick.<br />Yes, of course, the authors have an agenda. But anyone who thinks it is a simple &quot;pro-Bush&quot; agenda is looking at it too simply. In this book the authors look at policy with an extremely critical but fair eye -- exactly what the fourth estate is supposed to be doing. Thank goodness someone is still doing his job.<br />Buy the book today!!	2003-10-27

I don't see how any educated person can refute the facts in this book, and it should make a lot of people very, very angry. Talentless hacks and shills for the Democratic National Committee, such as Paul Krugman, are long overdue for a spanking ...and they get it in this book! The authors have a way of writing that is  articulate, honest, and intellectual that is a breath of fresh air from the bombastic, low-blow rhetoric that you see from many liberals (Al Franken, Michael Moore, Joe Conason, and, of course, the ultimate hack, Paul Krugman).

But I feel somewhat compelled to express my utter disgust with those one star reviewers who do not criticize the book on a fact-basis, but rather lash out in cold, unqualified hatred against anyone who dares to look at the situation objectively. The comparisons they make are scary, insulting, and have absolutely nothing to do with what is written in the book. There is a complete lack of basic respect for those of us who like this book. What's more is that the tone of these reviews suggests that most one star folks haven't even made a serious attempt to read it and understand it.<br />One-star folks, you scare me: the country was run by a bunch of you, and was heading for disaster until the current administration saved it. You don't even have to read this book to see this - just open your eyes and start watching/reading  something other than ABC News and/or The New York Times.<br />For the record: I am not in any way affiliated with the author, nor with any of the \\"official\\" supporters that were named. I am not even American, even though I live here. I love America, and I think Americans are generally wonderful, generous people. What the country needs now is to take a serious, mature, and careful look at the disaster that has unfolded in the 1990s, and make sure that nothing similar is ever permitted to happen again. This administration clearly represents American values, as contrasted with the one subjected to such thoughtful analysis in Mr. Lowry's excellent book. <br />Dissent isn't treason, it is healthy and required these days. The blind consent demanded by those on the radical Left, on the other hand, is what supported Hitler in Nazi Germany. Blind consent is what you are giving, one-star folks. Stop it!	2003-10-26

His writing is brilliant, the topics are hard-hitting and well-researched, and he comes from a thoroughly objective base. It's not scattershot criticism. When I started to browse these reviews, I was startled to find that he has become a &quot;whipping boy&quot; for some scarey, out of control lefttists. It's clear to me that he touches too close to the bone, and that makes the Clinton-camp defenders very nervous. I invite those of you reading to keep an open mind to these ideas.

Most of us back there can tell an idiot from a reasonable person. And I certainly agree with those who say that Moore is incapable of writing in an honest and truthful manner.  I have spent the past two months working on a book about the Bush administration, and virtually everything I found disputes what Moore says in &quot;Dude&quot;.<br />There are very serious questions about what the Clinton administration did during the 1990s that likely set the stage for what happened on 9-11.  Frankly, I think that Moore does not go far enough in indicting the Clinton administration for their crimes.<br />The entire Left-wing in this country is one virtual criminal enterprise, from people like James Carville to Bill and Hillary Clinton, and it is deeply disturbing that such people can have such a powerful effect on the relatively brain-challenged acolytes in the Democrat party.<br />Aside from being an enormous fathead, not to mention fat body , Moore is occasionally amusing. His anecdote about Hillary demanding to be seated far from the flatulent Senator Robert Byrd is priceless. There are some actual laugh-out-loud parts of the book. <br />Best reason to buy the book: Moore is going to use all the money he gets from the Bush tax cut to try to finally lose his virginity with a cute hooker. He'll need a lot of money to score a cute one, so buy more than one copy!	2003-10-15

If he is even aware of what his words mean, this fat pig can only mean that he regards himself as the moral or political spokesman of the victims; a disgraceful and disrespectful act of corpse-robbing since none of those people gave him permission to speak for them.<br /> Well Michael, I myself have a question for you, and I'll ask it with similar egomaniacal immodesty, on behalf of everyone who is not a complete bloody idiot.<br /> Why have you refused to issue corrections for books like Stupid White Men that have been savaged in the press for the unusually high rate of errors and misrepresentations they contain?<br /> You know the savaging I'm talking about.  Liberals alone account for an astonishing number of the critical beatings you've received, as you can find on any number of liberal websites, including, SPINSANITY.  And since they're your natural allies, that's not good.<br /> Unfortunately, it's not just your books that appear to have been written in a haze of euphoria after doubling up on your meds.  People keep finding numerous errors of fact in your documentaries and television programs too, some of which you've quietly corrected in re-issue without accepting responsibility for the original distortion.  Yet a film, even moreso than a book, must be painstakingly edited and undergo review by many people over a lengthy post-production schedule.  Only you could have had the veto power to keep a lie in.

He is a leftist. He opposes the Bush administration because he knows what they're doing will be good for the country, not because he is a principled man; even his own mother thought very little of him according to family and friends. His columns speak to the unreality of today's America with the disdain and arrogance of a Princeton economics professor. <br />His thesis, which appears to derive from an excess of prescription medications, is that the Bush Administration seeks to basically eliminate the 20th century--get rid of social security, medicare, unions, all of FDR's New Deal, etc., etc.  If you are prepared to believe that load of crap, then you probably will like this book; it'll make you mad and your head will explode.

The only thing worthy of comment concerning this collection of his newspaper columns is to ask why the NY Times is not more demanding of this guy. At best, his typical column is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash. He apparently thinks quoting other newspapers, magazines and columnists (Time, Knight-Ridder, Robert Novak, etc) to back up his points counts as primary research. So we end up with the standard views of the anti-war left. Iraq never attacked us, they were not a threat, there is no evidence of an Al Qaeda link and N. Korea is a bigger threat. This is Barbra Streisand with a spell-checker.<br />Krugman occasionally appears to have some clue as to the weakness of the position/comment included in his column. So, at the end, he may throw in some unsubstantiated malarkey that may or may not have any relationship to the basic point he was apparently trying to make. Krugman is so loose with the facts, that a veritable cottage industry has grown up devoted to setting the record straight relative to the voluminous misleading and often outright lies that make their twice-weekly appearance in his columns.<br />One of the unfortunate by-products of Paul Krugman is the general coarsening of debate in this country about matters of national concern and security. Krugman knows no bounds to his discussion of issues in his columns....facts don't matter...bashing the evil President is paramount in his view. Krugman has truly become one of this country's most despicable public personalities.	2003-09-20
