It is an essential and imperative part of the book; they are like twins. It is divided into a) spontaneous activities and b) evaluating voluntary MUAP.  <br /> <br />The first 24 pages discuss spontaneous activities; myotnic, Fasculation, end plate, tremor, cramps, etc. There are 36 video segments; most of the segments are played twice on different sweep. The last 18 pages discuss evaluation of voluntary motor units, (normal, ployphasic, recruitment, nascent, unstable etc). There are 17 video segments; also most of them are played twice on different sweep. <br /> <br />Each section starts with general introduction (stability, firing rate, morphology) and has a great \\"summary table\\". Basic concepts are discussed with easy to understand graphs. After the introduction, each pattern / finding (Neuromytonia, normal MUAP, etc) is explained, with the relevant clinical implications. There are ample of drawn traces, in addition to the concise, well directed, explanation for each video segment, emphasizing the major characteristics of the pattern. This organization and approach had extremely helped me to follow with this very helpful and educating video. I surely learned a lot, and I keep replaying it and learning from it every few months, I highly recommend it for every one dealing with EDX.   <br />	2005-04-05

Almost 400 pages, divided in 22 Fundamentals of sleep medicine (112 cases), and appendix. <br />The first few fundamentals (25 cases) deal with sleep staging, monitoring, architecture, and MSLT. Cases 26 till 78 are devoted to Obstructive sleep apnea, Respiratory arousals and CPAP, etc, and central apneas. There several cases for PLMS, Parasomnia, Narcolepsy, seizure, insomnia (case 79 till 103). The last nine cases (104-112) deal with circadian sleep. <br />Each case starts with few lines of history and exam (neck, pharynx) tracing, and question. The next one page (often 2-3 pages) explains in great, concise, easily memorizable way a specific topic in sleep medicine. They are reach with graphics, tracings. The case ends with few-several pearls summarizing the discussion. <br />I keep learning from this excellent book. I think that every health care provider who likes to learn about sleep medicine will find it as an excellent introduction and good simple resource.  <br />	2004-09-03

Each chapter has 4-7 cases. Each case is about 2-3 pages in length. Cases are very interactive and provoking; the questions are followed by the answers/explanations. The case is built in the following manner: history and exam, summarize it, localize (not all), differential diagnosis, obtain further info, narrow the differential diagnosis, management, and prognosis. <BR>In addition, there are informative concise reviews related to the case, for example Status protocol. <BR>I used this book during my oral board preparation, and I found it very helpful.

The author has an easygoing style that I greatly enjoyed learning from. The pages are small in size and the font is rather big; which allows to finish this guidebook in few hours, and repeated. <BR> <BR>There are twelve chapters. The firsts provide sensible advices about choosing \\"better&quot; words, sentences, tables, graphs. I found chapter six about Spelling and Grammar, Punctuation rich with great advices. Other chapters advice about how to choose the right journal. The author was straightforward in the chapters about clinical report, review article, letters to the editor etc and ethics. Really, I was impressed by the eighth chapter \\" how to get more writing done\\". <br />Briefly I learned a lot from this concise guidebook.	2002-11-24

Some explanations are short others are lengthy. He finishes with cross-references to other signs, and suggested readings.<BR>I enjoyed leraning from this dictionary, as it was a successful trial of putting many of the neurological signs in one book. It was really as the title said \\" Clinical Neurosemiology\\". As other books, nothing can be perfect, and occasionally (5-10%) I did not find few words, so I give it four stars.	2002-11-07

The speakers will cover the topics, and ask you questions so you feel yourself forced to say it in French, here I wished that they had repeated the answer twice so it will be easier, but they left enough time for answers. The difference from \\"Language 30, French\\" is this program has some grammar, including past time, comparing, adjectives and verbs. Each topic is given three pages in the booklet dealing with vocabulary and grammar, written in two column (French, English).<BR>I found this program helpful especially the grammar, and easy to follow while commuting.	2002-10-28

The text is detailed, full with helpful advices and cautions, especially about tricky points in the mission (where you must hide the bodies, unseen patrolling guards, time limits). Also information about liberating allies, or using barrel, which it took me long time to figure out had I did not use this manual. You do not have to follow all the tips exactly, use your imagination and feel the challenge of \\"straddling in the combat filed\\". I did that in Mission 5 and 13. <BR>It is a great help, and without the missions will take longtime to accomplish, so use and enjoy the Commandos.	2002-10-06

The main content of the seminar is about icebreaker, talking to acquaint, skills in conversations and body languages. It ends with conversational killers. <BR>I felt that the content could be delivered in about half the time, as most things are rather obvious. Yes there are many useful and helpful advices, especially with open-ended questions, and rephrasing few \\"daily questions\\" but their delivery on the audiotapes takes rather a long time. I agree with others to be careful not to be transformed to a nagging conversational, and not to ask annoying questions.<BR>Overall it is an average taped seminar.	2002-10-03

Using the appropriate commandos, distracting, climbing, hiding, and locating the bonus pictures. <BR>Occasinally I found myself unable to follow the advices provided, and must invent my own \\"temporary\\" strategy for that section, such in white death mission. <BR>I think it is necessary to read the strategy provided in this book before playing each mission, so you can obtain a general sense and idea, but you may need to create your own strategy, occasinally.	2002-08-20

There are many of statistical and epidemiological terminology in each article, some I am familiar with, but others are confusing and new. In this very helpful \\"dictionary\\" I was able to find more than 95% of the terms with brief definition and good short explanation that successfully allowed me to soundly evaluate the studies and prepare an impressive brief, neat handouts. The great thing about this dictionary was its well organization and ease to find what you are looking for. My friends frequently borrowed when they have to prepare their journal clubs, and found it really helpful.<BR>It is a dictionary; i.e., arranged alphabetically sequencing the terms, and if a term has more than one name, they mention them all, before the explanation.<BR>I highly recommended to every resident, as it will not only will help during residency, but also surely during real life and practice, especially a with hundreds of \\"trials, studies\\" appears in medical journal daily.<BR>I gave it four not five stars, because few explanation were rather short, despite informative, and lack of illustration and pictures, which may require you to use a regular textbook in Epidemiology, this happened maybe almost 1 from every 10 terms.	2002-02-17

After the answers there are several Pearls and pitfalls related to the case: like when you should suspect the disease or important epidemiological information, brief clinical review. Finally few refrrences. The case are well chosen covering wide spectrum of neurology; Headache, Stroke, Meningitis, Vertigo, Ataxia, Neoplasm, Dementia, most intresting were the few, but not uncommon disease such as Botulism, Cervical artery dissection. The drawback is the booklet is many years old, so some treatments are out of date, and there is NO MRI pictures, but that absolutley does not affect to any extent the wide selction of the cases nor the well written expalntions. The second part, about 30 pages is very short 12 cases dealing with common symptome or signs in the office followed by few lines of again well written explanations.
