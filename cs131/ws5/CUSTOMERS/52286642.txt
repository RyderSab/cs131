So, a \\"D\\" represents the devil, by resting on its round side with serifs accentuated into horns; three \\"O\\"'s hang from strings as ornaments; \\"X\\" is represented in an x-ray image of crossed finger-bones.  Each of the letters receives one page, on which the letter appears within a black box, with the word it represents printed below.  The bright colors against the black background give the illustrations an intense and dramatic mood, with a sharp quality; the glossy paper plays up the clean lines of the work.  Some of the illustrations are obscure and the letters so altered and distorted as to be unrecognizable; sometimes the illustrations seem a bit like an exercise for a graphic design class and not an instructional tool.  This book is certainly not appropriate for making the concept of letters concrete for young children, though children who are newly able to recognize letterforms may appreciate extending their knowledge with this book.	2004-09-15

Not a traditional narrative, the personalities of the alligator family emerge in a series of humorous vignettes associated with each letter of the alphabet.  \\"D\\" shows the child grudgingly helping his father \\"doing dishes\\"; \\"G\\" shows the family enjoying each other's company \\"getting giggles\\"; \\"T\\" shows the child \\"throwing tantrums,\\" which may be the cause for \\"H\\" showing the parents in bed with cold compresses \\"having headaches.\\"  Each letter receives one page, with three-color illustrations appearing in boxed panels.  Sendak's unique style comes through, with the alligator parents showing shades of \\"wild things\\" and the alligator child marching across the pages like Max.  Beneath the illustrations, an uppercase serif letter appears in the lower-left corner along with the associated phrase of words starting with the letter.  Children will love the small size of the book (approximately 5\\"x7\\") and will notice the relationship between the letters of the alphabet and the sounds they make in words.	2004-09-15

This book tells the story of a wrestler who encounters three generations of women as he heads to the capital city to begin the wrestling season at the court of the Emperor.  He's very conceited and literally loves the sound of his voice.  He comes across a young woman carrying water from the river and decides to tickle her for fun.  The fun is at his expense when she captures him and drags him home for further training before the wrestling season commences.  When they arrive back at the farm, the wrestler encounters her mother carrying a cow over one shoulder and her grandmother as she uproots a tree that gets in her way and tosses miles away.  The three women put him to work to strengthen him and after three months when he goes to the capital he easily defeats and scares off his opponents.  He returns to the three women to marry the daughter and live life as a farmer.<br /><br />I love that the book ends with the young woman carrying the wrestler up the mountain before she lets him carry her, though I sort of wish the illustration showed the former instead of the latter.  The illustrations by Kazue Mizumura are lovely, sort of reminiscent of Japanese calligraphy done with loose brush strokes in shades of black, white, and red.  The main lesson relates to humility and assumptions.  While the wrestler pays the price for his assumptions, the outcome is positive all around.  There is also an implicit message about class and idleness in the representation of the courtiers.  Finally, the book seems to celebrate humility, simple living, and, of course, hard work.	2004-09-15
US	52286642	RSWDL8KF9U0Z6	0395214076	117975055	Pyramid	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A captivating book on a popular subject with children	With exquisitely detailed black-line drawings, this book shows how the pyramids in Egypt may have been constructed. A two-page introduction gives some background of life in Egypt, including an overview of Egyptian spiritual beliefs and practices, especially those related to death and dying. The introduction makes clear that this book is based on an imaginary pharaoh and an imaginary pyramid and that there are differences of opinion about the construction process the Egyptians used.<br /><br />After the brief introduction, the illustrations dominate, comprising as much as 80% of the pages. Almost like time-lapse photography, readers can see the pyramid grow in vast landscapes, giving children a good sense of the scale of the pyramids, where people are just specks dotting the sides of the massive structure. In addition to these landscapes, Macaulay includes background on the people who designed and built their pyramids and their techniques with illustrations of the different workers and their tools, as well as architectural floor plans and cutaway diagrams.<br /><br />The text is difficult and presents challenges with its vocabulary and syntax as well as its concepts. A one-page glossary of Egyptian and architectural terms provides some assistance. However, the account of how the priest uses the stars to locate true north is a difficult concept to comprehend; the textual and pictorial explanations may not be sufficient for any but advanced readers.<br /><br />Though the text and many of the concepts are demanding, young readers will be carried along by the drawings that truly offer a step-by-step guide to how the pyramids were built. The distant and perhaps \\"quaint\\"-seeming aspects of Egyptian beliefs and practices are nicely contrasted with their highly advanced, ingenious construction techniques. Children familiar with some aspects of ancient Egypt will perhaps be able to see the \\"bigger picture\\" and gain insight and appreciation into the culture of the ancient Egyptians. Younger children will enjoy following the process and watching the pyramid grow from page to page, while older children interested in the \\"how's\\" behind history will appreciate this novel approach to learning about ancient Egypt.en will enjoy following the process and watching the pyramid grow from page to page, while older children interested in the \\"how's\\" behind history will appreciate this novel approach to learning about ancient Egypt.	2004-09-15

One by one, in order, the lowercase letters race up a coconut tree, which starts straight, but slowly bends under their weight.  Finally, the tree collapses throwing all the letters to the ground in a colorful pile.  Some adults (the uppercase letters) come to fetch and comfort their children, while the rest untangle themselves and assess their wounds (nothing more than skinned knees and stubbed toes).  After night falls, incorrigible \\"a\\" sneaks out of bed and races again to the top of the tree.  The story recites the alphabet but also intersperses jazzy chant-like language, like this passage after the coconut tree collapses:<br /><br />Skit skat skoodle doot.<br /><br />Flip flop flee.<br /><br />Everybody running to the coconut tree.<br /><br />Mamas and papas<br /><br />and uncles and aunts<br /><br />hug their little dears,<br /><br />then dust their pants.<br /><br />The illustrations bleed to the edge of the pages with blocks of color, framed with tropical-inspired orange and fuchsia polka-dotted borders.  The letters are clearly illustrated in brightly colored sans serif fonts and appear at all angles, upside-down and sideways.  The rhythmic language begs to be read aloud and children will relish the sound of the language.  (A superb accompaniment is the audio version of the book read by Ray Charles.)  The alphabet is recited twice through, emphasizing the sequence of the alphabet.  Because the letters of the alphabet are characters in the story with personalities, the book brings language to life.  Emergent readers will be inspired to learn their ABC's so they can enjoy the pleasure and fun of language themselves.	2004-09-15

Johnson's Caldecott Honor Book (1996) Alphabet City is a wordless book depicting paintings of scenes from urban life cleverly depict each of the letters of the alphabet.  Each letter (and painting) has its own page, such as an \\"E\\" in a side view of a traffic light, an \\"M\\" in the arches of the Brooklyn Bridge, an \\"R\\" in the cracks in the sidewalk, and a \\"T\\" in the negative space between two tall buildings.  The paintings are photo-realistic in style and view scenes from a variety of unique vantage points, some showing an entire landscape while others focus on a small detail.  The large size of the book and the high-quality glossy paper display the paintings to full effect.  Children who have newly learned their letters will enjoy showing off by spotting the letters \\"hidden\\" in the everyday settings and will likely begin spotting more letters in their own surroundings.  There is a secondary message in this book about the prominence of language in our daily lives and that we are surrounded by letters and language.	2004-09-15

Curious about Nawa, the wise man's story about the origins of the sacred buffaloes from the center of a lake, fearless young Little Wolf sneaks away in the middle of the night to keep watch over the lake.  The text conveys visceral, sensory experiences: \\"Little Wolf felt the blood run along his body.  He clutched at the prairie grass, crushing it in his hot hands.\\"  The story unfolds slowly with a few wordless spreads scattered throughout.  The story is divided into sections adorned with illustrations of artifacts, such as moccasins, hats, and weapons.  The action of the story is conveyed in soft and misty pencil sketches, capturing the dreamlike mood of the story.<br /><br />According to the author bio, Baker is an English author who spent \\"a great deal of time\\" with the Blackfoot Indians.  The style of the illustrations is reminiscent of anthropological or archaeological drawings.  A note at the conclusion of the story offering contextual details about the Blackfoot and the artifacts presented in the story would be a welcome addition, as well as acknowledgement of the fact that this is no longer the way of life for Native Americans.	2004-09-15

Each letter receives one page on which the uppercase letter appears in a black, serif font in the upper-left corner of the page and is accompanied by a realistic illustration of a hand demonstrating the manual alphabet of American Sign Language as well as an object cleverly representing the letter.  \\"G\\" is demonstrated by a gloved hand; \\"K\\" is demonstrated by a baby's hand holding a key ring; \\"X\\" shows an x-ray of the hand demonstrating the sign.  The illustrations of the hands are done in softly luminous colored pencil on charcoal paper, with exquisite detail.  The hands are of different races, sexes, and ages.  This book focuses solely on letters, but does offer a key that lists the words for the objects portrayed with each letter.  Of course this book will be useful for deaf children or children with deaf parents or friends who are learning the alphabet, but may be useful for other children as well to drive home the concept of abstract symbol systems and the different ways sounds and meaning can be represented.	2004-09-15

Each chapter offers one brief paragraph introducing the religion and includes beautiful full-color photographs of paintings and objects related to each religion, each with detailed captions.  Without a true narrative, the text is difficult to read.<br /><br />Although the book is broad in coverage, the treatment is uneven and biased toward major religions.  For instance, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism are each addressed in three chapters, whereas other belief systems are addressed in a single chapter.  These religions are indeed among the top six most practiced religions in the world, but Sikhism (number five ahead of Judaism, according to the Information Please almanac) only receives one chapter; Baha'ism (number seven, according to Information Please) is not mentioned at all in the book.  The beliefs and practices of people in Africa, North and South America, and Oceania are collapsed into two chapters on \\"The primal vision\\" and \\"Rituals of life.\\"  While smaller or ancient religions, such as the belief systems of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, perhaps deserve less coverage than major, modern religions, the book does not sufficiently explain the depth of treatment given to some religions.<br /><br />In all, this book does not do a very good job putting the religions of the world in perspective and does not sufficiently put the large amount of information covered in context.  Maps and a timeline would go a long way in explaining where and when these religions were and are practiced.  Charts or graphs showing the most practiced religions of the world would also be helpful.  Additional charts representing the monotheistic and polytheistic religions could also be useful in seeing how different religions of the world are interrelated.  Children and adults may enjoy leafing through the book to examine the exquisite art objects, but any knowledge gained will only be superficial and spotty.

The biography covers Roosevelt's childhood, education, courtship, marriage and motherhood, entr&eacute;e into politics alongside her husband, and her humanitarian work independent of FDR.  The text itself is straightforward and easy to read, presented in a scholarly fashion rather than the sort of fictionalized manner of some biographies.  While certain events are dramatized, no dialog is invented - the words the reader encounters are those of the figures themselves, from journals, letters, and speeches.  The best passages are the friendly and informative explanations offering children some background knowledge about the time, such as this account of courtship at the turn of the century, seamlessly woven into the chapter on \\"Cousin Franklin\\":<br /><br />Of course, Eleanor and Franklin were never alone together.  That would have been highly improper in those formal Victorian days.  When Eleanor visited Hyde Park or Campobello, when she met Franklin in New York for lunch or tea, even they went riding in the Roosevelt carriage, a third person was always present.  If a relative wasn't available, Eleanor's maid served as a chaperone (38).<br /><br />These frequent explanations offer the reader a broader insight into time, describing the conventions of the era in order to later set Roosevelt's often unconventional views and activities in contrast.  This treatment gives young readers a strong sense of why Roosevelt is worthy of special attention.  The text is accompanied by more than 100 black and white photographs, both formal portraits and informal candid views of Roosevelt.  Overall, the book focuses on Roosevelt's life as a public figure, though does not shy away from intensely personal matters such as her father's alcoholism, her adolescent insecurities, and even her husband's infidelity.  In this way, Freedman manages to create a very intimate portrait of the woman herself and to make a larger-than-life figure, with a highly privileged background seem very real and accessible.  Although Freedman's tone clearly indicates an admiration for his subject, the book does not idolize her, often drawing attention to her faults such as her lack of her tenderness as a mother when her children were very young (acknowledged by her son).  The book concludes with a photo album, bibliography, and index.  The book is readable from beginning to end and usable as a reference for exploration of specific events or issues from Roosevelt's life.  Children will likely come to this book because of a classroom assignment, but in the process will certainly be entertained and inspired.e portrait of the woman herself and to make a larger-than-life figure, with a highly privileged background seem very real and accessible.

In this cumulative folk tale, the sheepish, tail-less fox must barter with man and beast to obtain milk to repay the old woman to get his tail back.  The illustrations beautifully capture the penitent and forlorn character of the fox throughout his journey.  The gentle hills of the eastern European countryside spread across the pages, evoking quiet rural life.  This book won the Caldecott in 1972.<br /><br />As a folk tale that never reveals its setting, this book really doesn't address its apparent Armenian cultural origins.  The only clue as to its cultural origin is the costume of the characters: the old woman's babushka, the peddler's fez, and the miller's apron.  For children, and perhaps others, this may simply read as \\"old-fashioned.\\"  Comparing and contrasting this with other folk tales - particularly other cumulative folk tales - from other cultures might bring these subtle cultural aspects into sharper focus for children.	2004-09-15

As she slowly regains consciousness, she experiences strange sensations and dreams until she learns that her life has been saved with an unprecedented medical procedure in which her memories have been implanted into the brain and body of a chimpanzee.  Eva is set in the future, in a dystopian urban world in which humans have destroyed most of the world and are isolated in super high rises and fed a steady stream of television.  Eva's father is a researcher of captive, habituated chimps with whom Eva was essentially raised.  Eva's operation and recovery were sponsored by a manufacturer of juice products, who contractually own her and exploit her to advertise their products.  As she recovers and adjusts to her new life, she begins to identify with the chimp part of herself and relates to the other chimps, leading her to resist her handlers and her parents and campaign for greater autonomy for herself and her fellow chimps.  Eva eventually becomes the poster child for animal rights activists and a figure to whom many people look as an inspiration as the human race is degenerating.  Eventually, like her Biblical namesake, Eva is sent to an Edenic paradise with a troop of chimps to teach them to live in the wild and be televised worldwide for the entertainment of humans.  As events transpire, Eva and her troop are left possibly to repopulate the planet and begin the evolution of the human race again.  The story raises all kinds of existential questions about what makes us who we are, what is our relationship with animals, and what are our responsibilities to nature and the environment.  These thought-provoking themes are balanced by suspenseful action and well-developed characters (including the chimps).  With the highly introspective nature of this story and the slow and mysterious revelation of the plot, this is a challenging read.

Rey's Curious George Learns the Alphabet, the man in the yellow hat teaches George how to read.  George learns each of the letters of the alphabet as the man in the yellow hat relates both the upper- and lower-case letters to an object it resembles, starting with the letter.  So, \\"A\\" is the open mouth of an alligator, while \\"a\\" is a piece of an apple; \\"M\\" is a mailman and \\"m\\" is a mouse; \\"R\\" is a rabbit and \\"r\\" is a rooster.  Each letter receives a two-page spread.  The illustrations are typical Rey drawings with a great deal of personality; within the object representing the letter, the form of the letter is easily recognizable, superimposed on the object with thick black lines.  Some of the letter-objects are a little peculiar, but children who are just learning that letters represent sounds and objects will delight in the wacky illustrations of a spotted \\"J\\"-bodied jaguar, a man with an \\"n\\" for a nose, and the \\"q\\"-headed quarterback.  The narrative lessons on letters are interrupted a few times with interludes for George to play football and buy doughnuts.  Beneath the illustrations, each time the featured letter appears in the text (whether at the beginning, middle, or end of the word), it is highlighted with color.  In the story, George and the man in the yellow hat helpfully model the instructional process.  Although focused on letters and their shapes, because this book also tells a story, Curious George Learns the Alphabet offers a good way to first introduce the concept of letters, sounds, and words to children who are not yet focused directly on the alphabet.  More advanced readers will also be able to focus on letter sounds and letters in the context of words and sentences.	2004-09-15

The toddler wants to play with his older brother and seeks his attention by repeatedly throwing his teddy bear out of his playpen. When the older child indulges his brother, the toddler immediately knocks over his brother's block construction. When his older brother expresses his frustration, the toddler smoothes things over with a kiss. The story is told in a toddler's vocabulary, employing only seven words in a few phrases: \\"uh oh,\\" \\"no no,\\" \\"okay baby,\\" and \\"here\\"; many pages are wordless. With such simple language, the action of the story is carried by the very realistic pencil drawings done in soft colors. The illustrations are primarily tightly cropped views of the space in the playroom that the children occupy, but as the story reaches its emotional climax, the illustrations shift perspective to extreme close-ups on the children's faces. This book is often considered a multicultural book because the children in the book are African-American, though ethnicity is not at all the subject of this story. Toddlers (and siblings of toddlers) of any ethnicity will relate to this simple story about the warmth of a sibling relationship. This is an excellent book for toddlers and older children to read together.	2004-09-15

But Little Pumpkin's grandma catches that baby up all right.\\"  The book is oversized (10\\"x11\\") and illustrated with bright and colorful gouache paintings.  Each illustration is framed with a colorful border that bleeds to the edge of the page and the text itself is mottled with color.  The backgrounds of the illustrations are mostly flat planes of color, putting the focus on the interaction between the children and adults.  The three adult-child relationships portrayed represent a racially diverse selection of families, notably including an apparently multiracial child.  The story does not necessarily make a subject of ethnicity, however the repetition of many elements among the stories does demonstrate the universality of the affection and tenderness that parents and grandchildren have for their children, perhaps subtly suggesting that this commonality supersedes any superficial difference based on race.  The rhythmic language makes this a superb read-aloud book for toddlers and older children of any ethnic makeup.  With the final vignette focusing on a sleepy toddler being put to bed, this is also appropriate bedtime or naptime reading.	2004-09-15

Each letter has its own page, with a brief impressionistic poem addressing a subject that starts with that letter.  So, \\"D\\" is about a daisy; \\"M\\" about mosquitoes; \\"V\\" about vegetables.  However, the subject of the poem is never mentioned directly, instead the word spelled out in acrostic form by the first letters of the first lines of the poems:<br /><br />Green clusters, soon to be<br /><br />Red<br /><br />And<br /><br />Purple,<br /><br />Entwine the<br /><br />Stairs.<br /><br />Despite the rigid format, the poems never feel forced and are almost haiku-like in their simple rhythms and tones.  As the poems move from A to Z, they also form a kind of narrative, progressing from the early spring-like days of summer with the first day at the beach and to the late autumn-like summer days with stacks of chopped firewood.  Leslie Evans' woodblock prints feature rich colors, bold lines, and chunky shapes capturing the scenes described from a variety of perspectives, such as a narrow focus on a dragonfly sitting on a daisy to a sweeping orchard landscape.  This sophisticated book will impress children who know their letters with the power and elegance of language.	2004-09-15

The illustrations alternate between shades of gray and rich, rainbow colors with clean lines and abstract shapes.<br /><br />This book gives me goose bumps, from the language, the illustrations, and the message.  The language of the story is complex and exotic, using words like palaver, libation, gloaming (which I had to look up!), ocelot, and orchid. Phrases like \\"stranger-trees\\" and \\"fore-day-morning\\" give the sense that we're reading a translation from an oral narrative, poetic and in touch with nature.  I think this would be a popular read-aloud book.  The Dillons' illustrations are reminiscent of the slightly-psychedelic style of the 70's with solid blocks of color.  Unfortunately, the book doesn't offer any insight into the source of this tale.	2004-09-15

The illustrations are in warm shades of black and gray and represent the diverse peoples and landscapes of the wide region of Africa where Swahili is spoken.  The introduction describes where Swahili is spoken, including a map.<br /><br />This book is clearly written for outsiders and, as such, may be best described as a kind of social conscience book.  Too often people in the United States speak of Africa as if it is a monolithic culture and this book may help to counteract that narrow perspective by honoring a variety of aspects of African culture.  I especially like the scenes and activities portrayed in this book, from rural to urban, traditional to contemporary.  My favorite page is \\"uzuri means beauty,\\" with its description and illustration of two women, one with a crown of braided hair and the other with a shaved head and multiple pierced ears and its explanation that \\"Beauty means different things in different parts of Africa.\\"  The nicely written introduction reinforces this concept.	2004-09-15

This relationship to Esperanza permits readers to safely acknowledge their own naïvet&eacute; and at the same time feel proud that they know better than Esperanza - Ryan's characterization is quite ingenious.  The story confronts a number of tough issues (e.g., racism and the labor movement) without shying away or sugar-coating them.  Although the reality is gritty (life as a farm worker is certainly not romanticized), the novel achieves a hopeful, satisfying ending in which we admire Esperanza's evolution from a privileged and sheltered little girl to a hard-working and capable young woman.	2004-09-15

Each letter of the alphabet is represented in large serif font in uppercase and lowercase and is represented by illustrations of one to eight fruits and vegetables.  The illustrations are captioned with spellings of each fruit and vegetable, once in all uppercase and once in all lowercase.  The illustrations depict the fruits and vegetables as they appear at the supermarket, even including the wide rubber bands often found on asparagus and broccoli and the cardboard tubs that hold strawberries and blueberries.  The bright illustrations are in sharp contrast with the flat, white background.  The overall effect of the illustrations and type styling is crisp, clean, and colorful.  The book also includes a glossary of fruits and vegetables, with a small picture, pronunciation, designation as fruit and/or vegetable, and a brief description.  This glossary is particularly useful for items such as xigua (she-gwah), the Chinese name for watermelon.  Children will enjoy learning the more exotic fruits and vegetables.  This book will aid children in recognizing letters and the multiple words for each letter allow children to recognize the pattern of sounds associated with each letter.	2004-09-15

When the giant Abiyoyo comes to town wreaking havoc, the father and son save the day with the same ukulele music and magic.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and check out Seeger's performance, which is really is delightful - you can hear the children laughing at some parts and the adults at others.  The book, however, falls a little flat for me.  In print, the text seems dull and a little spare and, for a storysong, it has little rhythm.  The illustrations aren't particularly remarkable, but the diversity of the townfolk is a little heavy-handed, with an Asian woman with chopsticks in her hair, an Indian woman with a bindi on her forehead, a Buddhist monk, a bearded man with a yarmulke, an American Indian man with braids and a feathered headband, and a man of indeterminate origin with a turban on his head and a monkey on his shoulder!  With what we can hear in Seeger's performance, I wonder if a new edition with updated illustrations is in order.  Also, I would be interested in knowing more about the tale this was based on - in a nice introduction honoring the tradition of oral storytelling, Seeger admits to building the story out of a footnote.  I would be interested in knowing a bit more about the story's origins.	2004-09-15

As the title makes obvious, Mike Lester's A Is for Salad is an unconventional alphabet book.  The reader's participation will unmask this as a straightforward animal alphabet book cloaked in humor.  Each letter receives its own page, with a hand-drawn letter and a fractured statement.  \\"C\\" is for hot dog (eaten by a cat); \\"J\\" is for hats (worn by jellyfish); \\"T\\" is for polka-dotted underpants (worn by a tiger).  The illustrations, done with rich colors and crosshatched lines, are somewhat dark in appearance and character; animals appear annoyed or embarrassed with their squinty eyes and nervous grins.  The illustrations depict silly situations (a lion blow-drying his mane) and nearly naughty scenes (an elephant's behind exposed in the back flap of its pajamas).  These illustrations combined with the unconventional outlook of the book make for an exceedingly devious and sly mood for the book.  Children who have recently learned their ABC's will enjoy recognizing the correct letter and will take pride in \\"being in on the joke.\\"	2004-09-15

These children visited funeral homes, interviewed the elderly, and shared their own personal experiences with death and dying.  The book speaks frankly about topics ranging from the cost of funerals to assisted suicide and from burial customs to ideas about life after death.  The coverage of the book is comprehensive and will likely answer most questions adolescent readers have about death.  Since this book is nearly 20 years old, some of the material is outdated.  There will be more recent statistics on common causes of death and the percentage of Americans choosing cremation, medical information about diseases and brain death, and data on funeral expenses.  In addition, children today will not remember, nor relate to the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and John Lennon.  Nevertheless, the tone is straightforward and easy to read and the voices of the child authors ring through.  The text is helpfully divided into chapters which might be given to a young person who is confronting a particular situation, such as \\"When Your Pet Dies,\\" \\"The Death of Older Relatives and Parents,\\" \\"The Death of Children,\\" and \\"Violent Deaths.\\"  The text is also readable from beginning to end for those children thinking or worrying about mortality in general.  Sensitive subjects such as suicide and euthanasia are handled in a candid, even-handed fashion, though parents with strong religious beliefs may wish to read these sections together with their children.  Adult readers will find the book useful in thinking about ways to approach the subject of death with their children and will find especially helpful the children's recommendations for \\"How Kids Should Be Told\\" about death.  The book begins with an introduction explaining how the children came to write the book and concludes with a brief annotated bibliography of children's fiction and non-fiction addressing the subject of death.  Unfortunately, the book does not include an index, which would be helpful.y, the book does not include an index, which would be helpful.	2004-09-15

For instance, the \\"Black Ink Formula\\" is presented as a solution to a classmate's problem with a dried out marker the night before an assignment is due.  Though a little corny, the scenarios do add a bit of personality to what would otherwise be a rather dull chemical cookbook.  For the most part, the directions for each experiment are easy to follow.  While the text does include some illustrations and diagrams, more extensive use of visual step-by-step guides with more diagrams or even photographs would be helpful.  Some of the experiments do require some unusual supplies, such as coal, moth flakes, and cobalt chloride, but the book does include an introductory chapter called \\"Setting Up Your Lab\\" which offers tips and advice on where to find the necessary items.  The text also includes careful warnings to children about handling materials such as Ex-Lax, ammonia, and isopropyl alcohol and suggests that children work with an adult when using the stove or an iron.  Parents will also appreciate the tips to avoid making a mess, such as laying down newspaper on a table, or conducting the experiment in the sink.  Most experiments can be performed with minimal adult supervision.  Both children and parents alike will appreciate this book, especially for some rainy day fun.  The book includes a bibliography as well as a thorough index.	2004-09-15

Narrated by an eager, awe-struck bird and a reluctant, uneasy bee, the tone will put children at ease with their own feelings about the subject.  The book does not require any prior knowledge, though does address children's misconceptions and relates information to what children may have heard elsewhere.  The coverage of the book is comprehensive and will answer most questions a child from ages 7 through 11 have about sex, sexuality, their bodies, and their feelings, in language they can understand (including terms such as \\"pee,\\" \\"poop,\\" and \\"balls\\").  Sensitive subjects such as masturbation and homosexuality are handled frankly and without being judgmental.  For instance, the text reads, \\"Every family has its own thoughts and feelings about masturbation.  Your family may feel differently from your friend's or cousin's or neighbor's family about whether it's okay, or not okay, to masturbate.\\"  This treatment makes the book a perfect way for parents to raise these subjects and talk about them with their children.  The book also covers topics such as adoption, sexual abuse, and AIDS.  This broad range of subjects will address the diversity children find in their own families, or in the families of their friends or classmates.  The material is organized into 22 two-page chapters, which can be read in order or browsed according to a child's interests or curiosity.  The text can be read aloud by a parent, but children may also study the illustrations closely on their own.  The illustrations are cartoonish, but also accurately represent human anatomy - the chapter on pregnancy includes actual-size illustrations of the developing fetus.  The book includes a helpful index, helpfully explained by the bird and bee.	2004-09-15

In Suse MacDonald's 1987 Caldecott Honor Book Alphabatics, letters transform acrobatically from letters into objects that illustrate the letter and its sound.  By way of an introduction, an \\"A\\" in a boxed frame grows arms and legs and vaults out of its box across the first pages of the book until it becomes an acrobat perched on the title on the title page.  In later pages, an \\"i\\" splits in half, spreads its wings, and transforms into an insect; an \\"r\\" sprouts feathers and grows a beak, becoming a rooster; a \\"Y\\" bulges and transforms into the head and horns of a yak.  Each letter of the alphabet receives a two-page spread.  The upper- and lower-case letters are printed in a bold sans serif font in the upper left corner of the left-hand page.  Just beneath, either the upper- or lower-case first appears unaltered in a box and its transformation is shown step-by-step across to the pages.  The final object is shown on the right-hand page along with the word.  The illustrations are comprised of bright blocks of color, presented on a crisp white background.  The treatment of the alphabet is letter-focused and demonstrates to children just beginning to recognize letters that letters are special shapes that transform into words and meaning.	2004-09-15

The boy describes to the reader how they survive at the airport revealing the subculture of many \\"airport regulars\\" making their homes in the airport.  The boy gets jealous of the people greeting each other, but takes inspiration from a bird trapped in the terminal who found his way home.  The watercolor illustrations depict the action of the story in soft and somber in shades of blue and brown.<br /><br />There's an irony that the object of the father and son is not to be noticed and the effect of the book on its readers should be to raise consciousness of the issue of homelessness.  The line, \\"Not to be noticed is to look like nobody at all,\\" is the most evocative, reminding us that identity is subsumed in homelessness and that as individuals they are invisible and not valued.<br /><br />However, the end of the story turns a bit preachy and the story of the bird is very sentimental - there's no subtlety in the treatment of the issue.  Of course in this age of airport security, the book is very dated.  Was airport homelessness ever common enough for this to be an authentic representation of the issue?  The setting and the characterizations present an idealized, almost contented view of the homeless.	2004-09-15

For instance, without \\"G,\\" there would be no green and oak trees would be blue and pastures pink; without \\"N,\\" birds would have wigs instead of wings; as for \\"O\\":<br /><br />What if there were no letter O?<br /><br />You couldn't COME, you couldn't GO,<br /><br />You couldn't ROVE, you couldn't ROAM,<br /><br />And yet you couldn't stay at HOME!<br /><br />Where would you be, had heaven not sent you<br /><br />The letter O to orient you?<br /><br />Each letter is portrayed on a single page, with verses ranging from two to twelve lines.  Each verse is beautifully illustrated by David Diaz's exquisite and unexpected designs, such as a lovely banana with a disgusting eel instead of a peel (illustrating the importance of the letter \\"P\\").  Diaz's illustrations are stylized in intense, gradient, glowing colors.  The illustrations each overlay a pale yellow version of the letter found somewhere in the background of the page.  The type is treated with the same care as the illustrations, with the letter to which the verse is addressed set off in a bold, colorful, sans serif font.  Younger children will enjoy the nonsense-like poetry and the playfulness of the language, while older children will discover new and unusual vocabulary words and find inspiration by the possibilities of language.  The introduction exhorts children to protect the alphabet: \\"Be careful, then, my friends, and do not let / Anything happen to the alphabet.\\"  This book will offer children of all ages an appreciation of letters, words, and language.	2004-09-15

They dream of the perfect chair and, when the jar is finally full, like Goldilocks (as Grandma said), they go searching for and find a chair that's just right.<br /><br />This book focuses on three generations of women who are self-reliant.

Threatened by the horsemen, the city leaders pray to the Great Cloud Dragon for help.  One day an old, fat man comes to the city and announces that he is a dragon.  Han takes him to the palace to meet with the city leaders.  The old, fat man offers his assistance if the leaders will show him courtesy.  The city leaders scoff at the old, fat man and send him away.  Han gives up his own meager meal to the old, fat man who decides to save the city for his sake.  Han tells the story to the people of the city and is called \\"The Honorable Defender of the City.\\"  Mercer Mayer's illustrations have the appearance of ancient engravings with expressive faces and intricate detail.<br /><br />This story shows the folly of judging by appearance and the rewards of kindness.  This lesson is reinforced when the city leaders - the Mandarin, the Captain of the Army, the Leader of the Merchants, the Chief of the Workmen, and the Wisest of Wise Men - explain that surely dragons must look like Mandarins, Army Captains, merchants, workers, or wise men.  Unfortunately, the source of this tale is unclear.  Is it a traditional folk tale or the author's invention?	2004-09-15

With a simple 180º rotation and flip, the book can be read from either end, with an uppercase alphabet in one half of the book and a lowercase alphabet in the other half.  The letters of the alphabet and accompanying drawings are distorted and nearly unrecognizable, requiring a curved mirror to view in the proper proportion.  (The book includes sheets of reflective silver paper and instructions for rolling them into tubes for revealing the \\"magic.\\")  Though the format and the presentation are unconventional, the subject matter is highly conventional.  Each letter, upper- and lower-case, receives a single page and is accompanied by a drawing of an object that starts with that letter.  The correct spot for placing the mirrored tube is marked by a circular seal which includes a botanical drawing that also starts with the letter on the page.  So, \\"a\\" is represented with an anteater and an apple; \\"g\\" is represented with a goat and a gentian; \\"T\\" is represented with a tiger and thistle; \\"W\\" is represented with a windmill and walnut.  The father and son team did the drawings and the letters (respectively).

Each letter receives a two-page spread.  On the right-hand page a full-page illustration appears, while on the left a giant, artfully-drawn uppercase letter is displayed next to large upper- and lower-case letters and a list of 3-40 vocabulary words that start with that letter to be found in the drawing (along with an additional hidden upper- and lower-case version of the letter).  So, the \\"K\\" vignette portrays a knight and a king wielding a knife, riding a kangaroo, holding a kettle, with a key chain in its pouch, a kitten on its head, and a koala clutching its tail.  Most words are familiar objects (e.g., water, wand, whale) that are not too difficult to locate on the adjacent page, though some exotic words (e.g., ibis, Inuit) will challenge older children and expand their vocabularies.  With the juxtaposition of many unrelated objects, the watercolor illustrations are appealingly crowded and surreal, forming a visual puzzle.  Framed in boxed panels, items from the illustration playfully stretch outside the frame.  Included at the end of the book are additional games to be played with the pictures, including finding objects that end with \\"t,\\" creatures with four legs, and the object that has \\"blades but not for cutting\\"; an index to aid with the additional games as well as a list of answers are also included.

Starting at the end of the alphabet and progressing forward, each letter has one page devoted to it with verses ranging from two to seven lines, in varying rhythms.  The verses address the confusing idiosyncrasies of the English language, complaining about homonyms, silent letters, and other anomalies in a slyly exasperated tone:<br /><br />R is for RING, RANG, and RUNG,<br /><br />And yet RONG would be wrong, dear.<br /><br />Q is for QUEUE, but not CUE.<br /><br />And for one QUIET QUESTION:<br /><br />Are we almost done?<br /><br />Answer: There's sixteen more letters<br /><br />Still left in this song, dear.<br /><br />The verses are accompanied by Richard Hull's surreal illustrations, done in crest- and seal-like vignettes against a stark white background.  Observant readers will discover all kinds of objects starting with the same letter embedded in the exquisite illustrations.  (The end of the book introduces a participatory aspect in the form of a list of words to be found in the book for a game of \\"I Spy\\" with difficult vocabulary for even highly-literate adults, such as xerophyte and kyphosis.  Parenthetical definitions, explanations, and humorous asides obviate the need for the dictionary for these words, as well as words children may not know, such as olive drab and arbor.)  The back cover describes the book as \\"An alphabet book for folks who already know their ABCs.\\"  Children who are grappling with the difficulties of matching letters and sounds in English will appreciate the tone of the verses and may even develop a special fondness for the idiosyncratic nature of our quirky language.	2004-09-15

As the reader pieces together these different materials, the story of a controversial episode over the course of several weeks in a high school emerges.  Freshman Philip Malloy is struggling in English class and homeroom with his teacher Miss Narwin.  Due to a failing grade in her class, he is unable to join the track team, his greatest ambition and likely only route to college.  In a fit of unruliness, Philip sings along to the national anthem as it is played over the PA for morning announcements during homeroom.  Warned twice over two days about breaking the rule to observe \\"respectful, silent attention\\" during the anthem, on the third day Philip willfully pushes Miss Narwin's limits until she sends him to the principal's office where he is promptly suspended.  When relaying the day's events to his parents, Philip tells only part of the story, noting that he was suspended for singing the national anthem.  Outraged at this supposed affront to a young man's expression of patriotism, a local politician and the media catch wind of the story and spread the story - full of misinformation and factual errors - across the country creating a huge media storm, which eventually results in the end of Miss Narwin's teaching career and similar unfortunate consequences to Philip himself.  The story examines the variations a mistruth can go through when filtered through person after person and illustrates how different people can have multiple perceptions and interpretations of the same event.  The various types of material offer the reader several points of view and provide insight in to the story that none of the characters alone possess.  This dramatic irony gives the reader a feeling of privilege as well as frustration as the events unfold.  The resolution of the story is deeply unfair (though true-to-life) and may be unsettling and unsatisfying for many readers.  Near the end of the story, the politics of education may be above the heads of some readers or simply dull to others.  Some readers will find the non-traditional structure of the story hard to follow and slow to read.  For avid readers, this book is a good tool for media literacy instruction, offering insight into how personally damaging misinformation can be and perhaps inspiring healthy skepticism of what they read and hear second-hand.Near the end of the story, the politics of education may be above the heads of some readers or simply dull to others.

As explained in a prose introduction to the poems, the story was told to Cullen by his cat Christopher, with whom Cullen shares credit for the work.  Christopher also annotates the poems with his own verse notes providing more detail on certain events in the story and scolding Cullen for incorrect grammar.<br /><br />The poems are highly imaginative and fun to read aloud, with varying rhyme schemes and meters, capturing the characters of the different animals described.  The poems have understated morals - if the Sleepamitemore had not been so lazy and the Double-Headed Hoodinkus not so quarrelsome, they would have survived - but are much more focused on being silly.<br /><br />The prose introduction from Cullen explaining how his relationship with Christopher Cat came to be creates a strong feeling of kinship with both narrators.  A prose epilogue encourages us to reconsider Christopher's reliability as a narrator, while at the same time challenges us to consider the inner lives of our own pets.<br /><br />The poems are accompanied by illustrations of the various animals that did and did not make it on the Ark.  The illustrations, done in color-washed black and white line drawings, are dark with a loose, sketch-like quality.  Though not tightly integrated with the text, the illustrations do give life to the fantastical creatures described in the poems.  Younger children will enjoy the rhythm and the subject matter of the poems themselves and older children will enjoy the explanation of the origins of the poems.	2004-09-14

This is a collection of eight fairy tales originally written in 17th century France.  The stories include the familiar \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Little Red Riding Hood,\\" but both with unfamiliar endings.  Other stories include the incredibly gory \\"Bluebeard,\\" the esoteric \\"Rickety Topknot,\\" and the didactic \\"Diamonds and Toads.\\"  The stories highlight traditional themes such as obedience and kindness, but are often subverted by complicated plot twists (the moral of \\"Bluebeard\\" is particularly hard to decipher).  Unlike their more familiar, sanitized, modernized counterparts, these fairy tales are gruesome stories with a wry sense of humor and without sentimentality - though they all begin \\"once upon a time,\\" few end \\"happily ever after.\\"  The language is dramatic, with long sentences and difficult syntax.  The stories range in length, from 5 to 15 pages.  The text is printed large and accompanied by small in-line and full-page illustrations, portraying scenes and characters from the stories.  A good match for the stories, the illustrations are very dark and murky, in shades of gray; the people have bulging eyes and grotesque expressions.  The book also includes an Afterword about the history of fairy tales and an Appendix offering the original verse morals that concluded each story.  Though the book jacket indicates that it is for \\"All Ages,\\" these stories are entirely inappropriate for most young children; filled with ogres with a particular taste for eating children and other bloody scenes, the subject matter of these fairy tales are not at all appropriate bedtime reading.  With its scholarly additions and grisly subject matter, this book may not belong in a juvenile collection, but adults and older children may enjoy exploring the origins of fairy tales.	2004-09-14

The text playfully rhymes the names of the soldiers with the portion of the cannon they bring and the rhythm and repetition suggest a military cadence, appropriate to the theme.  The illustrations are woodcuts with bold lines and intense colors printed on textured, laid paper.  With the old-fashioned style of the type and the illustrations, the story has a timeless feel, though the rich colors keep it vibrant and current.  As each new soldier appears on the scene, the illustration becomes more elaborate with less and less white space until finally the General gives the order to fire.  The story literally concludes with a bang, with the pages completely saturated in color and line representing the cannon's dramatic explosion.  As a sort of anti-war epilogue, the final page of the story shows the cannon overgrown with flowers and home to nesting birds and a spider web.	2004-09-14

The language is sophisticated and old-fashioned, with complex sentence structure.  The vocabulary, including names of people and places, is very difficult.  The storylines are intricate and challenging to follow, especially when read intermittently.  While these qualities may capture the spirit of the original story, they also make for difficult reading for children.  Furthermore, the 250-page length will daunt most young readers.  Scattered throughout the text are simple black and white full-page line drawings; each chapter also begins with a small, illustrated head.  The illustrations are static, but recall the style of classical Greek figured vases.  While classical Greek mythology can be popular subject with children, this retelling does not significantly simplify the story or the language for young readers.  Even read aloud, the complicated story lines may be challenging to follow.  For reading in school, the book would be greatly enhanced with a glossary, guide to pronunciation, annotations, and maps.  For leisure reading, I would recommend this book only for highly motivated children and young adults.	2004-09-14

The story begins with the hackneyed sentence \\"It was a dark and stormy night,\\" but immediately veers into highly imaginative territory.  The story follows a misfit sister and her savant baby brother, along with their kindred friend, as they go chasing through space and time after their absent physicist father.  After using their wits to do battle against evil, they succeed, returning triumphantly with their father.  Although in the end love truly conquers all, the story's conclusion is satisfying without being overly sentimental.  With its subtle references to a space-race-like scientific endeavor and its anti-communist stance, adults will immediately recognize this as a work of the 1960's, but at 40 years old, the story does not feel particularly dated, even with its scientific references (only the mention of a room-sized computer stands out).  While known as a classic work of fantasy, Wrinkle in Time is also a coming of age story and taps into universal adolescent concerns, with the beginning chapters focused on the theme of the troubled teen and \\"dysfunctional family.\\"  These themes perhaps brand this as a novel for young people, though it is sophisticated enough for adult readers to enjoy as well.  The story does offer likable characters to whom children can relate with their flaws and desires, most of all their desire to fit in and be loved.  With its long descriptive passages, frequent lapses into introspection, and challenging language and syntax, the reading may be slow going for some children, though the compelling action and unique, recurring characters should carry them along.  Plowing through this \\"grown up\\" book will make strong readers proud of their accomplishment.	2004-09-14

Kipling uses the beast fable as a jumping-off point to tell inventive stories set in exotic locales and eras, such as the traditionally themed \\"How the Leopard Got His Spots\\" and the more ingenious \\"The Cat that Walked by Himself.\\"  Less interested in conveying a moral than in amusing his readers, Kipling tells his stories with a warm and endearing narrator, who frequently directly addresses the young reader as \\"Best Beloved\\" and often notes the hopelessness of understanding grown-ups.  The tone of the stories is further enhanced with the inclusion of Kipling's small pen and ink drawings, wittily captioned with commentary about the inadequacy of the drawings and including utterly irrelevant, but entertaining asides.  The stories possess a joy in the sound of words, with language that begs to be read out-loud.  Though the vocabulary may be difficult and foreign for some readers, it will likely be overlooked and overcome as part of Kipling's fantasy world.  The rhythmic language and the fantastical themes combined with length of the stories (ranging from 10-30 pages) lend themselves to bedtime reading.  More than a century old, the stories have a timeless feel, though the original edition does include some outdated and potentially offensive references to race and gender, which may require some explanation by adults.  Overall, these stories will appeal to young children absorbed with the \\"whys\\" of life at the same time that older children will enjoy the sly chumminess of the narrator.	2004-09-14

Some poems employ dialect, while others use rhyme.  Most poems are ten lines or less, with some poems only ten words long; only two poems are longer than one page.  Although often addressing the subject of race, many of the poems speak to universal and stirring themes of dreams, pride, and possibility.  The poems are accompanied by several full-page woodcuts done in black, white, and terra cotta; the type picks up the same color scheme.  The illustrations are stylized and handcrafted, depicting everyday scenes pulled from the poems.  This collection also includes an introduction by Arna Bontemps and indexes of the poems by title and by first line.  Young readers will be attracted by the longer, more descriptive poems, as well as the lyrical poems.  However, many of the short poems written in plain language are deceiving in their simplicity and many readers may not appreciate these poems as poetry.  As a whole, the book lends itself more to the study of Hughes' work and of African-American culture than to leisure reading.	2004-09-14

Holiday Poems for Young Readers	Books	2	0	0	N	N	May not deliver what most readers are after	This book is a collection of 84 poems on the subject of holidays.  The poems address 14 specific holidays in all, including New Year's Day, Lincoln's Birthday, Easter, Mother's Day, Columbus Day, and Christmas.  (Notable absences are Martin Luther King's birthday and Hanukkah.)  The poems are organized thematically by holiday, which are arranged chronologically, beginning with New Year's Day.  As indicated by the title, this collection is meant for children.  With its four indices - by author, title, first line, and translator - the collection is effective as a resource, but with its illustrations (somewhat sentimental in style) and light themes is also suitable for browsing.  The collection includes pieces by historically renowned poets (Tennyson, Shakespeare), more modern famous poets (Robert Frost, e. e. cummings, Gwendolyn Brooks, Langston Hughes), and well-known children's writers (Shel Silverstein); also included are traditional verses and poems by the anthologist herself.  The collection does not include any discussion of the criteria for inclusion, but it seems that poems were selected for their thematic relevance first and their appropriateness for children second.  Many of the poems were written for children, though several poems in the collection are excerpts from longer works not at all addressed to children, such as four lines from Hamlet that refer to Valentine's Day.  Many other poems are presented out of context and have only a tangential relationship with the holidays they are meant to represent, such as an American Indian poem written in an apparent time of need from a son to a father promising better times (commemorating Father's Day).  Still more of the poems have a touching, but gloomy tone, such as Brooks' \\"Otto\\" about Christmas morning in a poverty-stricken family.  Readers coming to this book as a resource to find poems to celebrate the holidays will be disappointed by many of these poems; younger readers will find many of the poems difficult and dull.and dull.	2004-09-14

The story, by Jane Yolen, takes place in ancient China and tells of a tiny princess, not much thought of by her family, who uses her intellect, creativity, and skill to save her father, the emperor, held hostage by kidnappers.  The text of the story is lengthy (many pages have ten or more lines of text) and more explanatory than descriptive.  The illustrations, done in multi-colored paper cuts, bring the text to life, depicting the most dramatic moments of the story.  The illustrations stretch across both pages and often bleed off the edge.  Despite their exquisite detail, the illustrations are flat and float in the white space of the page, without any sense of depth or context.	2004-09-14

From the black of the end papers, Crews drops the reader immediately into the action as the story begins on the title page with the truck being loaded with colorful boxes of tricycles.  From there, the truck begins its journey from New York through the Lincoln tunnel, passing truck stops and gas stations and enduring rain and traffic jams, until it crosses the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco where it unloads its cargo.  The illustrations have an intense graphic quality, with sharp geometric shapes, heavy dark lines, and intense blocks of color.  The style evokes the abstract shapes of road signs and intense colors of roadside attractions.  The illustrations, printed on glossy paper, stretch across both pages and bleed to the edge of the page, drawing the reader further in to explore the pages.  Children learning to read will be able to recognize many words in the road signs and on trucks and vans.  Non-readers will enjoy spotting the red truck on each new page.  The embedded storyline encourages children to follow a sequence of steps in a larger process, while the absence of words encourages children to elaborate on the action, making up their own stories to accompany the images.	2004-09-14

When his parents become concerned about his behavior at school (growling and storing meat in his desk), Norman's principal signs him up for the school's werewolf club along with Ralf Alfa, Billy Furball, and Lucy Fang.  The club is sponsored by \\"weird and scary\\" teacher, Mr. Talbot, who always wears a long coat, gloves, hat, scarf, and sunglasses.  The children discover that Mr. Talbot is, in fact, a werewolf stuck in wolf form as a result of a curse placed on him by his half brother, Lance Von Sweeny.  The curse can only be lifted by the titular magic pretzel, in Lance's possession.  Obtaining the pretzel and returning Mr. Talbot to human form the book's main adventure.  This is the first book in a series, which picks up from Pinkwater's 1985 book, I Was a Second-Grade Werewolf, slyly mentioned as Ralf's favorite book.  Presented in 78 pages and 38 brief chapters, the story begins by providing a bit of background in \\"Chapter Minus Three\\" through \\"Chapter Zero\\" as a kind of countdown before launching into the main story.  The tone is playful, current (the first chapter's \\"Frequently Asked Werewolf Questions\\" recall FAQ's on the World Wide Web), and hip without seeming to pander to childrens' tastes.  The story is easy to follow with many comically nonsensical tidbits, including the parsnip car driven by Lance and the Museum of the Pretzel.  The book's simple cartoonish black and white illustrations bring faces to the characters and, in the case of the children, present vital statistics such as height, weight, and type of wolf on ID cards.  Although the characters and events are outlandish and comical, the story presents aspects of school and family life that will be familiar and poignant to children.  Newly independent readers will enjoy the fast-paced and funny style of this chapter book; avid readers will also enjoy beginning an entertaining series.	2004-09-14

The stories include trickster tales, such as \\"Tricksy Rabbit\\" and \\"Nansii and the Eagle,\\" as well as fables that explain the origins of weaving in \\"Wikki, The Weaver\\" and the (reverse) evolution of apes and monkeys from humans in \\"The Prince Who Wanted the Moon.\\"  The stories have morals in praise of ingenuity and generosity and warning against greed, treachery, and pride.  The language is straightforward and filled with lively dialog.  The stories are short enough (5-8 pages in length) for bedtime reading for younger children and unassisted reading by older children.  The text is accompanied by black and white pencil drawings of people and animals, most half- or full-page, with two dramatic scenes that stretch across two pages.  The animals are sometimes represented as realistic, with naturalist-quality detail, but more often are cartoonish, with expressive faces, bringing the fantasy world of the fables to life.  The drawings of people show the same attention to form and character.  An introduction (by now quite dated), as well as useful explanatory source notes and a glossary of African terms and expressions accompany the stories.  This is an excellent collection of stories for both children and adults.	2004-09-14

Specifically, George and Martha learn the importance of unconditional support, respect for privacy, and consideration of others' feelings and also discover that practical jokes have consequences.  While each story can be read separately, the final stories blend together with a surprise ending.  Each story is told in five pages or less and the text is very easy for beginning readers, with common words, short sentences, fewer than ten lines per page, and large serif type.  More advanced readers will continue to remain challenged by some longer words.  Although the stories are brief and the language simple, Marshall uses the rhythm and phrasing of the text to create a strong emotional response and sophisticated humor.  With understated narration punctuated by short (often terse) snippets of dialog, the stories are meant to be read slowly and savored, with pauses for giggles and snickering.  The overall effect is dramatic, with suspenseful moments at the end of most pages.  Each page of text is accompanied by an illustration and each story, as well as the book as a whole, is introduced by an illustrated, hand-lettered title page.  The illustrations are cartoonish black-line drawings filled in with pink, yellow, green, and orange, with George and Martha in appropriately weighty masses of gray.  The texture of the brush strokes and pencil lines is visible, emphasizing the hand-craftedness of the drawings.  Both children and adults will enjoy the sly tone and touching themes of the stories.	2004-09-14

One mouse - Frederick - does not gather corn, nuts, and wheat along with the others and instead sits apart explaining that he is gathering sunrays, colors, and words.  Although reproachful of his apparent idleness, in the depth of winter, the other mice come to appreciate Frederick's ability to entertain them by sparking their imaginations.  Lionni employs color, texture, and shape in his collages comprised of torn and cut paper in solid colors and patterns pieced together into landscapes.  Each collage stretches across both pages and bleeds to the edges of the page; by means of the layers of paper, the illustrations have an enormous sense of depth and presence.  Visually, the illustrations dominate the pages, with the text appearing in the upper left corner.  At times, the illustrations elaborate on Lionni's spare text, while at other times the illustrations offer an abstracted version of the concrete details mentioned in the text.  In the final pages of the story, the integration of the text and images is complete, as the text itself becomes an element of the collage.  Lionni's language is simple, appropriate for beginning readers, but poetic as well, as befits a book about a mouse-poet.  Ultimately, Frederick encourages us to respect others' differences and reminds us of the power and value of imagination.	2004-09-14
