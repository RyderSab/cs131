Despite this being about the 8th Fletch book, chronologically it's the first.<br /><br />In this story Fletch has only been working at the News-Tribune for a few months and is getting less and less respect from Frank each day as his sarcasm and pranks are riling everybody up. Frank shifts Fletch from one section of the newspaper to the next, never knowing where he's going to cause the least trouble. Some local lawyer wants an interview to announce that he's giving 5 million dollars to a museum and Fletch is to run the (small) story. Trouble is, the lawyer, one Donald Habeck, is killed in the News-Tribune parking lot almost that very second.<br /><br />Frank pulls Fletch of the story right away gives it to a big bully who's been with the paper for years. Fletch is now left with investigating some whorehouse and that he does. But he's not giving up on the Habeck story as the circumstances seem mighty suspicious, especially when he finds out that the firm Habeck worked for is probably the most crooked law firm on the planet.<br /><br />It's fast-paced and full of witty, and sometimes odd, dialogue and neat little gimmicks and ironies. Fletch's detective work and level-headedness provide a sense of balance in relation to all the wierd and eccentric characters around him. And the crooked cops and authorities seem right out of a James Ellroy book. I did find a few anachronisms though. If this is set before the first Fletch book then surely there wouldn't be carphones and computers in every office. At least not a computer thats not as big as the office itself. It's a tiny little complaint though.<br /><br />A good read and an involving mystery. Fletch is the best unsung hero of crime fiction.	2005-09-11

Such as hook-handed killer, psycho's in the attic, exploding pop rocks and microwaved dogs. Not taking kindly to demons repeating picking on New York the boys in grey set about taking him down. But getting in the way is Venkman's Mayoral campaign an old-fashion Ghostbuster privately hired by the city who may not be everything he claims to be.<br /><br />Despite frequent grammatical errors (how did these slip by the editor?) Sholly Fisch manages to give us decent plot and nails the characters of Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Zeddemore dead on. Although it's an obvious continuation of Ghostbusters II it does feel a bit like The Real Ghostbusters sometimes. The supernatural mythology just doesn't have enough weight behind it. And for such a long set-up the ending was incredibly tame.<br /><br />Still, it's a great read and a must for Ghostbusters fans. I hope we can get more of these in the future.<br /><br />PS<br /><br />The as-of-yet unreleased book Ghostbusters: Urban Legends featured here on Amazon is not a new Ghostbusters novel. It's just a reprint of this one with a different title.	2005-09-05

Books	5	1	1	N	N	The mightiest hero of all time!	The world of Conan is an amazing place. A world that takes survival of the fittest to new extremes. A world where all women are perfect bodied nudists that only the strongest man can have. And a place where the darkest of magicks and monsters of unspeakable evil dwell.<br /><br />It is our planet and the time is the Hyborian Age. A time so thickly described and imagined by Robert E. Howard you almost believe it really did exist. The most appealing thing about the stories of Conan is that each one takes place in different, highly imaginative land with new wonders and secret for the great Cimmerian to uncover.<br /><br />Conan is not the dunderhead seen in the Arnie movies but an extremely intelligent and cunning warrior who always rises to the top of any faction he has made himself a part of and is Captain of a million pirates, General of a thousand armies, King of a hundred lands and an fair fight for almost no one. Conan always wins because he's just simply the mightiest, strongest and most vicious fighter their is.<br /><br />But he does have morals and is more human than most people he encounters no matter how many times the call him a barbarian dog. And it's easy to identify with a man who loves to travel and keep on going, never wanting to stay in the same place too long. I mean there is so much to this world (but even more to his) that staying in an office for 40 years is downright insane.<br /><br />Robert E. Howard is an uncertified genius and his Conan Chronicles are an immortal testament to that fact.	2005-08-22

Something like a novelisation of a movie or some other such pulp fiction. While, I hate to admit it, Batman: No Man's Land is such pulp. It's a novelisation of the massive graphic novel from 1999. And it takes ages to get going, sags for a while, then picks up toward the end.<br /><br />Basically, Gotham has been 99% destroyed in an earthquake and the government bails out of responsibility for this American City and declares it a No Man's Land. Anyone who stays loses their citizenship. And anyone on this island is not allowed back on American soil. Else they go boom-boom! Sound like Escape from New York/LA?<br /><br />All the psychos escape from Arkham and soon Gotham is mostly run by Penguin, Two-Face and the GCPD. Joker lies low until the third act, when he really comes into play. The villain with the most dedicated space is Harvey Dent (Two-Face), played once so crappily by Tommy-Lee Jones in the movie but actually quite sympathetic here. It is never revealed what happened to him. I guess Greg Rucka just forgot about Two-Face as much as he did Poison-Ivy and Mr. Freeze. I mean, what was the point in even mentioning them if they don't make and appearance?<br /><br />The storytelling has quite a few lulls between the action and interesting bits and is filled in with tacky stuff right out of a TV soap movie. This really bugged me and further robbed the book of any true integrity.<br /><br />Pick it up for a dollar. It's worth a read, but it's not a classic by any means.	2005-07-13

Though it's well known that Conan Doyle was growing tired of the character by this point.<br /><br />The story is of a brutal murder in a mansion house in the English countryside. There's not much sense-making evidence to work on so Holmes and Watson go down to investigate along with Scotland Yard and the local police. Sure enough, Holmes solves the case rather quickly and all is revealed. But it's here that Conan Doyle uses the same split narrative he used in A Study in Scarlet. The story jumps far back in time and details the long, sinister plot leading up to the murder in the mansion. It's a good story and quite addictive. But I'm afraid I saw the plot twist coming (though it's an imaginative surprise) and only because there were no small revalations at any point, therefor I knew I big 'un was coming and deduced the logical conclusion.<br /><br />And is it just me or is there a major anachronism in the story? Holmes speaks of Moriarty as if he is still alive. But didn't he chuck him of the Reichenbach falls and watch him fall to his death? Unless this story is set before then. And who is this mysterious Porlock? It was never cleared up. Perhaps in a future story eh?	2005-06-21

But I'm glad to say that The Opal Deception is a return to form and is the most fast-paced and enjoyable Artemis Fowl book yet. This series has now over-taken Harry Potter in my opinion, as well as the Bartemaeus Trilogy, which keeled over and died with The Golem's Eye.<br /><br />In this entry Arty and Butler are marked for death by the evil Pixie Opal Koboi, who they helped defeat in The Eternity Code. Holly Short, Foaly and Commander Root are also on her hitlist. And after the surprise death of a main character (not telling) the people of lower elements must rely on Artemis Fowl's cunning skills to stop Opal from destroying the worlds as they know them. I must say I was always a bit uneasy with the one deviant Artemis turning to good but it seems to fit now.<br /><br />All the cool technology, crazy inventions and pro-environment subtexts are back as well as Colfer's to-the-point storytelling. It's the longest Fowl book yet but still the quickest. I would have finished it ages ago but I lost it in Gran Canaria when I left it by the pool (stupid mistake) and had to buy another one. Definitely one to buy. I cannot wait to see what Colfer does next!<br /><br />And if you are going to invest time and money in this book then UK hardcover is the best edition as it has a shiny cover and a cool wraparound.	2005-06-12

Upon reading them now I begin to wonder where the brilliance is that I originally saw. Maybe now that I'm older and a bit more refined pulp like this doesn't appeal to me much anymore. Still, there's a couple of interesting bits in this book. But not much.<br /><br />I've never read the graphic novel on which it's based and it also seems to be a continuation from an Aliens graphic novel too as characters introduced at the beginning seem to have quite a bit of back-story.<br /><br />Nothing really happens in this. Almost all of the pages are filled with a build-up to a big fight that never really happens. It just kinda fizzles out. No big epic battle, no big plot twist.  No reason to read it really. It is, however, better than the wanton AvP film. A brick in the face is better than that.<br /><br />Pick this up only at a charity shop.	2005-06-07

The recent American printings are not available in stores over here so image how cool it was when I got all of them for Xmas. Who cares if they are older printings?<br /><br />Chevy Chase is one of my favorite actors (though he does seem to have vanished off the face of the earth recently save for campaigning heavily and controversially with Senator John Kerry in the recent elections) and I love the Fletch movies. Many people use the unoriginal expression that 'the book is always better than the movie' but, as my review title says, they usually end up being as good as each other.<br /><br />The book is slightly harder in tone and Fletch's sarcasm frequently comes across as arrogance. I understand the movie had to keep things a bit lighter in order to be a PG but the whole drug smuggling and corrupt cops plot is just as serious her as in the movie. Stuff like Fletch's drug-addicted 15-year-old girlfriend, her death and a fair amount of swearing are the only differences the books has in tone. Where is seems a bit bland in comparison to the movie is that it's fairly static. Also, the final confrontation with Alan Stanwyk has a touch more nobility and Fletch's attitude towards him less apathetic.<br /><br />In Fletch the movie Chevy Chase travels all over the place, impersonating people, using crazy aliases, breaking and entering etc. But in the book most of the aliases and investigation is done through phone calls at his office or from his apartment. It lacks excitement in this respect.<br /><br />All your favorite characters are still in here such as Fletch's perpetually angry boss Frank and the sleazy Lawyer Gillette (Arnold T. Pants Esq.). Definitely a book to read for fans of the movie or anyone who enjoys crime fiction. And how natural does it seem to imagine Chevy Chase as Fletch regardless of the tone or situation?	2005-04-23

One could watch the film a hundred times over and still pick up on small things and be totally puzzled over the meaning of it all. When you think about it, The Dark Crystal is a small miracle. Not only is it a very grim kids film, hardly any of the mythology is explained and there's loads of subtext and hidden meanings. How many can say that about Finding Nemo?<br /><br />Brian Froud has always been fascinated with faeries and goblins and such so when he was hired by Jim Henson to work on this movie it must have been a dream come true. The first section of this book covers Froud's experiences working on the movie. It's an interesting read but the remaining part of the book requires the reader to have a vivid recollection of events in the film and patience to add it all up. Not an easy read or your typical 'making of' book at all.<br /><br />Two thirds of the book is told from the point of view of Aughra, the one and only of her race, the prophet born of rock and stone. She explains to us the history of her world, the great divide of the Urskeks and the creation of uUru and Skeksis.<br /><br />The depth of Brian Froud's imagination is astonishing. The triangular and circular imagery of the film is spelled out so vividly that several reads of each page are needed in order to fully understand it all. The quality of the presentation is of the highest standard. The book is a huge hardback with beautiful pictures in color, black and white and daguerreotype. Some pages are translucent trace paper laid over spirals to give us a better idea of what they mean. A reproduction of Jim Henson's original presentation to potential backers of the film is included in the back page inserted in a pouch.<br /><br />Investment in this book is well worth the money for fans of the film and those interested in faery mythology and even art students.	2005-04-16

Not so much because it's long but because it's soooo boring and has far too many slow parts. It actually became quite embarressing as people thought I was a retard struggling to read some kids book for months. But, truth be told, I was just never motivated to read it because it's a real drag.<br /><br />Set a few years after the first Nathaniel is now working in Parliament and is surrounded by backstabbers and bloated, pompous fools. And he is NOT the same character he was in the first book. He is now an evil wretch just like those awful Magicians who tormented him before. So, right away our partial narrator is on our bad side and the character flip-flop kind of throws us off.<br /><br />The Resistence is still a big problem and are the main suspects when a huge golem starts tearing up London. Nathaniel promptly summons Bartimaeus once more (much too Barty's annoyance) to help track down who is really behind the descruction.<br /><br />Instead of being strictly a two-part story between Bartimaeus and Nathaniel we now have the inclusion of a new narrative from Kitty (the Resistence girl briefly included in the first). Her story is initially intriguing as her life is destroyed by a corrupt Magician but, along with everything, it isn't dealt with in any sense of urgency.<br /><br />What could have been interesting ends up being very dull, very slow and even more boring as the story drags and lulls with every chance it can get. Stroud is just way too descriptive of stuff that doesn't matter. And his subtext and subplot is pretty obvious commentary on class wars, current world affairs, terrorism, Superpowers out of control, fascism etc. Ironically, he's never really descriptive of important points in this particular universe. Only towards the end do we discover that America is still an uninhabited land with few Native Tribes scattered across the continent (the good old days) and Britain is still the ruler of the world more or less.<br /><br />Quite simply, the book is too long. For a good 200 pages the plot threatens to keel over and die as Nathaniel travels to Prague to meet an undercover agent and blah, blah, blah. Practially NOTHING happens in this part of the book. Far, far too much time is spent describing nothing important and I frequently wondered if anything interesting was going to happen. It never really did.<br /><br />Only read if you are an absolute DIE HARD fan of the first. Otherwise, stay away.

It's set in the dark, dark and miserable far future where humanity has wrecked the earth and human life is nothing compared to the almighty Dollar (or Dinar as it is here).<br /><br />Satellite City is a typical example of how human life exists in this dark tomorrow. We never know which country it is but the population seems to be multi-ethnic. But smog, acid rain, filth and little-to-no hope dwell among the mile-high skyscrapers and factories.<br /><br />Cosmo Hill is an orphan at an Institute where parentally-challenged children are treated like waste. After he escapes on pure chance he is almost killed in an electrical explosion. And that is when he sees the Parasites. Blessed with the supernatural gift of seeing these creatures he is initiated into a group of kids whose job it is to bust said creatures.<br /><br />A decent, if not exciting, plot follows that ends in a meagre twist and an unsatisfying wrap-up that leaves the door open for a sequel.<br /><br />There are some parts of this book that are quite fun, such as the trip into outer space and Cosmo's escape from the Orphanage but for the most part this is surely Colfer's weakest book with some serious lack of thought put into storytelling (the whole thing is a thinly veiled excuse for him to vent his cynicism over big-business, politics, cooperate greed and humanity's general apathy at the declining state of the planet) and character (a character called Ditto is so-called for repeating everything people say to him, but never actually does this at any point).<br /><br />I'd rather see another Artemis Fowl book than a Supernaturalist 2. Yes, Colfer is free to try new things (and this is an interesting failure indeed), but it is certainly not the cheeky and cheerful antics we've come to expect.	2004-09-24

As you can tell, this in no ordinary race. The bikes are super-duper-bikes, the courses are hundreds of miles long, the terrain is crazy and the fans are not just human. Alien races of all kinds come together to be witnesses to these insane spectacles.<br /><br />But a winning streak for Falcon comes to a grim end when a fan runs out in front of him and causes a fatal pile-up.

I'm a big fan of Sonic the Hedgehog and I love the current comic books but this is a collection of the first few issues from way back in 1993 (I actually remember getting these when I was 12 years old) and it's a bit too childish. The stories are totally neutered and the animation bright and colorful. It's nowhere near as sophisticated as Sonic is today.

There is definitely not a lot of plot to sustain the 700+ pages and it is in need of some serious trimming down. There are many chapters that are just plain useless, sub-plots that are uninteresting and further no particular cause, and a distinct lack of anything really dramatic.<br /><br />If all the usual stuff was left out and the book focused only on Lord Voldemort's return then it would have been entertaining to read. But with such a plot why did JK Rowling feel the need to chuck in Quidditch matches (these are seriously getting boring, how many variations of Harry catching the snitch do we need?), Harry's boring problems with a girl he inexplicably likes, uninteresting points about homework and revision, a meaningless subplot involving Hagrid's brother, a pointless subplot involving Firenze the Centaur becoming a teacher, and Hermione's involvement with SPEW and all her knitting. If all this boring stuff was left out then we would have been left with a pretty fast-paced book. I'm sad to say though, this one really lets the whole series down.<br /><br />There are some new touches that are particularly effective however. A new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, called Professor Umbridge, is just about the most evil, twisted and horrible woman ever. Rowling's description of her perfectly describes absolute wickedness and malice. And it's also good to see Neville Longbottom get a chance to act the hero for once, he's always been a character I like.<br /><br />I hope the next book isn't as overlong and tedious as this. OOTP was a MAJOR let-down. I can only seriously recommend it to absolute HARDCORE fans. I mean if the first book made a 153 minute film and the second made a 160 minute film then OOTP would be a film lasting almost 9 HOURS!!!	2004-01-20

What makes this book special is that each strip/story has a commentary by Bill Watterson on what inspires him and how he feels about his own creation. This book has a huge introduction by Watterson on why he chose never to turn Calvin and Hobbes into a huge franchise and why he finally decided to quit while he was ahead. A noble career move methinks.<br /><br />There are some great stories in this one such as Calvin's hijinks with the transmogrifier/duplicator and the some of the Sunday color strips create some highly evocative atmospheres.<br /><br />Plus, this book contains the most interesting fact EVER. What is the even scarier than a T-Rex? A T-Rex in an F-22 fighter jet.	2003-12-28

Even as an animated feline he's better than Garfield. He's the perfect best pal for Calvin and the interaction between them is wonderful. Just take a look at the back cover. I wish I had a tiger like Hobbes. To everyone else he's just a stuffed toy but in Calvin's eyes he the cuddliest cat ever.<br />The best thing about Calvin and Hobbes is the way Calvin is wise well beyond his years but still has the many illusions of childhood.

US	52239651	R1W0RR0EMF9WZM	078681859X	506234393	The Amulet of Samarkand, Book 1 (Bartimaeus )	Books	4	4	5	N	N	The Best of it's kind	I know it's unoriginal to compare children's fantasy to Harry Potter. But when said young wizard is the standard practically all authors in the genre have to live up to it's hard to avoid comparison. The Amulet of Samarkand is the first book in the 'Bartimaeus' trilogy and it's definitely more sophisticated than Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl.<br />The story is of a 12 year old boy called Nathaniel who is adopted by a sour, strict magician at the age of five to train as magician himself. In this world the Houses of Parliament is full of magicians and they run the country using their own reckless methods, much to the distain of the commoners (Muggles in the Harry Potter world). As a way of getting revenge on his cruel master, Nathaniel summons a cynical, sarcastic djinni called Bartimaeus to steal an apparently ordinary amulet (of Samarkand) from his master's colleague's house to frame him.<br />But the Amulet of Samarkand is a very special artefact indeed and is the centrepiece of a sinister plot hatched by evil magician Simon Lovelace. Of course Nathaniel realizes this all too late as he's soon in the middle of Lovelace's evil plan. Though he does have Bartimaeus under 'verbal contract' and with the help of this disgruntled djinni he attempts to foil Lovelace.<br />The story is told from two narrators. Nathaniel's part is typical 3rd person perspective and Bartimaeus is first person. The book regularly switches between them after every three or so chapters. There's a lot of pathos to be had in Nathaniel's side of the story and he's definitely a stronger character than Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl and Bartimaeus's version of events are always interesting especially with his often amusing footnotes at the bottom of every page.<br />Stroud's world seems much more probable than JK Rowling's too. The word wizard is only mentioned twice in this book (tho it would have made more literal sense to have not been mentioned at all) and no one uses wands (magic is either done with the hands on inside pentacles with incantations instead of spells). Plus Stroud seems to stick to ancient middle-eastern mythology as his source of inspiration rather than just make up silly sounding words to add a bit of light humor (the Harry Potter books are extremely guilty of this). His cold London winter setting and slightly oppressive tone make this harder than normal children's fantasy and (for a first novel in a series) it's a highly detailed world to be immersed in. Giving the impression that Stroud thought about all this beforehand and it's not something he'll develop as he thinks about it over the course of three books.<br />The Amulet of Samarkand is a long book. And takes some time to get thru. I was a little put off by the middle of the book, which sagged somewhat. For this reason I cannot give the book 5/5. But it's still the most superior and intelligent children's fantasy I've read. I eagerly await 2 and 3.

US	52239651	R3RA8JSMT28JY9	0553577336	720171728	Big Game (Predator)	Books	2	12	14	N	N	Pulp	It's been a while (or six years) since I've read a Predator book. I remember liking them when I was a kid but now, after being exposed to writing far more sophisticated and intelligent, these kind of books are no more than pulp. But entertaining in a lowest common denominator way. The story of 'Big Game' is taken from the 1993 comic book of the same name. A native American soldier is hunted by the predator out in the desert. They fight in unexciting ways and the mystical babble preceding every chapter about Indian legends and spirits being invoked to fight the Predator fast become repetitive and boring. It's not terribly unique or engaging. There is no atmosphere or pathos. Characters are introduced, described and then killed. You can tell as soon as a new character turns up that they are going to die if they have less than a paragraph of description to them. The book feels very padded this way.<br />And the Pred himself is kinda boring. There's no connection to him or real sense of menace. In fact, tho the writer calls him a hunter (but never once a 'Predator'), he appears to be more of an indiscriminate murderer than an alien hunting for honor and sport. A rather weak story indeed. But perhaps I'm being over-critical. This is a book for 13 year olds or someone looking to pass the hours of a long journey. Do not read Predator: Big Game looking for sophistication or a thumping good slice of Predator lore. It's low-quality stuff. The constant spelling errors only prove this.	2003-11-29

To begin with, I wasn't so impressed with this entry. After the lean and to-the-point mystery of Prisoner of Azkaban I was bored to tears with the pointlessly long and empty opening of Goblet of Fire. The first 100 pages are the slowest and most boring so far in the Harry Potter books. I urge you to skip the first few chapters (up until the badly described and confusing 'riot' at the Quidditch World Cup) and get straight to Harry aboard the Hogwarts Express as nothing of interest happens before this point.<br /><br />But once back at Hogwarts all the usual hi-jinks start. There is yet another Defense Against the Black Arts teacher (even weirder this time), the usual hassle from Malfoy, rumors of Lord Voldemort's return to power coincide with Harry's scar hurting, but no Quidditch. Instead two other Wizard schools (Durmstrang and Beauxbatons) bring their best students to visit for the whole year to participate in the Triwizard tournament. A sort of Olympic Games for Wizards, but only three (chosen by the Goblet of Fire) are allowed to complete.<br /><br />But somehow the Goblet spits out a fourth entry (Harry), giving Hogwarts two chances to win the tournament. Much to the annoyance of almost every other student as they all think he wants to be centre of attention again. But even worse for Harry because he didn't enter the tournament because he didn't want to and he was too young. But someone put his name forward and once again Harry has to risk his life while solving a dozen mysteries.<br /><br />This book is nowhere near as fast paced as PoA and sometimes it seems that Rowling is far too at ease with her catatonic way of developing the plot. I would have preferred if it were more concentrated and wasted no time. I never felt like I was getting anywhere with it no matter how many chapters I read. But by the end, when the plot threads are tied together (and some left annoyingly hanging) the book feels more wholesome but the payoff still doesn't feel as big as it should be for trudging all the way through a slow story with a beginning so slow it's almost going backwards.<br />I sure hope The Order of the Phoenix is better.ld be for trudging all the way through a slow story with a beginning so slow it's almost going backwards.<br />I sure hope The Order of the Phoenix is better.	2003-11-08

They don't take place in Pratchett's discworld so it's accessible to anyone not familiar with it (like me).<br />Truckers is the story is of a huge bunch of Nomes who live in a massive Department Store called Arnold Bros (est 1905). They have lived there so long that they have forgotten what came before. They have no idea how the human world works and their mysterious talking box only gives them the slightest of clues. But they usually misinterpret what it says. For example, the store often has a mammoth sale, even tho there are no mammoths for sale. After receiving the horrible info that the store will be demolished the Nomes hatch a daring plan to escape in one of the delivery vans.<br />Diggers (a rather Christmassy story) picks up as soon as the Nomes stop their truck and make a new home in an abandoned quarry. But as soon as they settle in word has it that the quarry is to be re-opened (by order). Their talking box speaks of a spaceship orbiting the earth for thousands of years apparently awaiting their return. So some of them take-off for Florida to stowaway on a shuttle launch while the rest plan an escape in an old Digger (jekub).<br />Wings is not so much a sequel as it is 'what happened elsewhere during Diggers'. It's the most interesting of all three as it has the most story. The Nomes' plan is so far-fetched and impossible that it's so funny to see it actually work. I really like these stories and perhaps some day I'll start reading the discworld series. But this is fine introduction to the writing of Terry Pratchett.	2003-10-26

All the past movies are referenced and it all feels more connected. Plus, this book was taken from the original script and contains a few extra bits that were not in the movie (save the dumb ending) such as Jason attacking Linderman at the rave and the girls in the jeep almost running over Jason when he crosses the road at the cornfields.<br /><br />Apart from that it's the same as the movie. There's no art in adapting a script into a novel but it's still an interesting read and moves at a fast pace. Though I was let down by the dumb ending that was totally different from the movie and didn't make sense.<br /><br />Tip: Don't bother reading this for English class. Like I said twice already; it's artless and not anything you can go deep into.	2003-10-18
US	52239651	R1R2AL21JVT8EH	0140433627	655343360	Frankenstein: Or the Modern Prometheus	Books	2	5	15	N	N	Over-rated and over-written	I read a condensed kiddies version of this when I was 8. I liked it better because it got to the point right away and lacked the increasingly dull indulgence in using zillions of paragraphs to describe things that don't really have anything to do with the story. It comes as a rather large surprise that this book is held in such high literary regard. Perhaps back in 18-something it may have been scary but by modern literary standards I'm afraid to say that Frankenstein is gibberish.<br /><br />Perhaps this stems from the fact that Mary Shelley just wrote this for a laugh. She, Lord Byron and another pal were on Holiday in Switzerland and had a competition on who could write the scariest story. Shelly instantly came up with this, which is probably why it seems so uninspired, unfocused and meandering. Granted, the subtext is interesting enough, even to this day, but that's not what the book is about.<br /><br />Shelley does go on a bit. Far, far too much time is wasted on set-up and over-description (her love of the Swiss countryside is evident in the dozens of pointless paragraphs describing the landscape) when it should really just be getting to the point. And then when the point finally arrives...it's underwritten. It feels like the book is nothing but filler. I mean when the monster/beast/wretch/daemon/creature is being created Shelly hardly writes anything. Where did Frankenstein get the parts? How did he put it all together? How did he actually bring it to life? She doesn't even have a full or half-full description of what the monster looked like. This could have been interesting in a macabre way but it's ignored.<br /><br />And what's the deal with the monster going from not being able to speak or understand language to talking like some sort of Oxford professor within a few months? It's so far-fetched and hard to swallow. Tho there is sympathy to be had for the monster and doubt whenever Frankenstein badmouths him.<br /><br />Another problem is the actual storytelling. The narration shifts 5 times in the course of this book and it becomes most annoying. I suppose this benefits the views of 3 different people but when they conflict in no way or contribute to the story what's the point? Frankenstein should have had tighter editing? For what it is it's a decent tragedy but NOT horror of any kind.the course of this book and it becomes most annoying.

Some of this book was cool but there was a huge feeling of deja vu as I progressed through these stories. It's no secret that Conan Doyle brought Holmes back to life only by popular demand and not because he felt anything special for the character. As a result, these stories and mostly uninspired and are basically retreads of stories that have come before them.<br /><br />Plus there are some parts that really bug me? How does Holmes make a living? Never once does he actually charge these people for his services. Where does his cash come from? And for that matter where does Watson get his money from? He says at the start he sold his practice to shack up with Holmes so if he is not a GP then what is he? A mere observer to the Mysteries? And what of his wife Mary Morstan? Does he not live with her any more? According to this he lives with Holmes? What is going on?<br /><br />If Conan Doyle were really serious about these stories then elements such as these would have been stronger and characters would be more fleshed out. The introduction of a new character in Inspector Stanley Hopkins is practically useless as he is just a generic police officer.<br /><br />The long and unrealistic monologues aren't so abundant here but the stories always seem to get off to a slow start. A couple of them are cool and interesting but never seem to generate an atmosphere or give any chance for Holmes or Watson to evolve.<br /><br />Conan Doyle only wrote these stories because his readers wanted them. Not because he felt they needed to be told. He felt totally indifferent about Sherlock Holmes and these generally poor stories only prove that.	2003-07-27

Well, I got it dirt cheap but I'm still pleased to have it.<br />In order, every episode from 1989 to the 1998 season is covered in this book. Each show is given a plot synopsis, funniest lines in quotations, trivia notes and in-joke references along with pictures and cast details. Every page margin has a special section for one-off or returning cameo characters such as Gil or Handsome Pete. The trivia comes in sections called 'Stuff you may have missed' but most of it is easy to spot first time you watch the episodes. The real subtle humor is mostly left out and I can't imagine why this is.<br />Once each individual season is cover a double page spread is devoted to such whacky stuff as 'The Signs of Springfield'. Anyone who watches the show will know that there is some pretty weird stuff written over the town such as 'Costingtons-Over 200 years without a slogan' or 'Don't eat beef...eat deer'.<br />Matt Groening designed this book himself and he's done a cool job. It's easy to read and quickly accessible as a reference guide. There are two more books so far in this series that cover the seasons since 1998. I'll get round to buying them someday coz if they are exactly like this then they are definitely worth it.	2003-06-15

But still Eoin Colfer doesn't give us enough. Last time the action was underwritten and ended up being a bit confusing. That ain't the case here but it's the characters that fall short amid the story. Holly. Foaly and Root (who thankfully isn't in this much) are not further developed in any way. Juliet has more time now but her sub-story slows down the rest.<br />Plus Jon Spiro was a very weak villain. He just didn't do anything except surround himself with stereotyped goons. And a subplot about him being connected to the Mob seems to have been forgotten by Colfer at a certain point.<br />Sure, it's the longest Artemis Fowl book yet but I still can't get over the fact that the first was so much better, had more action and was just way more enjoyable. I kept waiting for the big ending to come, only it didn't happen. There is no finale to this threequel. It just ends, leaving many questions. What happened to Spiro? Where did the C-Cube go?<br />The C-Cube had the capability of juicing up the story but nothing much was done with it even though it was a pretty original plot device. It's a shame it had to be no more than a generic MacGuffin.<br />It was also a bit open-ended. Colfer could end the franchise with this one if the wanted to (tho he has never taken full advantage of all the possibilities it can offer) but I doubt he will. I'm sure we'll see the return of Arty in May 2004. I got the Hardback cover with the red/glittery wrap-around, very nice.	2003-05-24

And composers don't feel the urge to inject words like 'love', 'baby' and 'yeah' to make sure the listener likes what they are listening to. One piece of music can mean 100 different things to 100 different people. One of the main reasons I like film scores so much is that the pictures have been removed from the music, letting see your own pictures in your head.<br />Such logic is strongly used in this book. I'd never read any books by Tim Bowler before this so it was a total random purchase. And I'm glad I did because I liked it very much. The story is of Luke Stanton and his troubles with being a teenager, struggling with so many burdens and the death of his dad. He's a great pianist and everyone is his 'quaint little English village' says so. Tho he's hanging around with the wrong crowd and they want him to break into some old lady's house so they can get their hands on her jewellery box.<br />What he finds in there tho is only the beginning of a story that, when ended, will steal your heart away forever. I've never so totally satisfied with the ending of a book until this. I really liked it a lot.<br />I'd definitely recommend this to any teenager struggling to find a good book for English class. It's not in-your-face, it doesn't raise the bar of extremities, there is no ugliness. Just a great story told in a peaceful environment. (Tim Bowler's fiction town is so well described you can be fully orientated as to where everything is)<br />Oh, and my copy is signed by the Author. Just wanted to show off.	2003-05-09

I am a big fan of the Werewolf: The Apocalypse/Rage franchise and I have read 4 books previous to this but I am sorry to say this one is bad, bad, bad.<br />It's like the author knew loads about the World of Darkness and went into crazy, over-description on this to make up for the fact that there is simply no story or decent dialogue. I am surprised I even managed to make this much out as it is so badly written little sense can be made from every single page.<br />No plot or story really kicked in at all. If you have read the 'When Will You Rage' book you will be able to understand how good short stories with likeable characters work. None of that is present here. It's simply an absolute mess. I was considering reading the rest of the books in this series but now I will really have to reconsider if this is the going to be the typical standard.<br />If you like this franchise then read 'The Silver Crown' or 'Breathe Deeply' for cool Rage stories.	2003-05-03

For anyone who is interested in the Myst story then this book is essential. It took quite a bit of time to get going at the start (about 100 pages are devoted to drilling holes) and Rand Miller uses the word 'great' to describe almost everything. It gets a bit annoying.<br /><br />But soon enough the story picks up in pace and builds interesting and sympathetic characters, even making one of the bad guys seem justified in his actions. Some of it is superfluous but not so much that it's boring.<br /><br />I found the end to be a bit fast and confusing. Not enough is described and one the last page is finished you might feel like things aren't tied up so well. Though there is another book after this one. I hope that the character of Saavedro from Myst III is mentioned somewhere, tho it is cool to have a young Gehn as a character is this one. If Saavedro doesn't show up then I know I am not alone in wishing for a fourth Myst novel.<br /><br />I am very much looking forward to reading 'The Book of D'Ni' and I hope it lives up to this and the first. For anyone who is interested The Sci-Fi channel are making a 240 minute mini-series of Myst set for airing sometime this year. I don't know what the story is yet but I believe that either Rand or Robin Miller are executive producing.<br /><br />The book has only six chapters averaging about 100 pages each and has random black and white drawings sporadically scattered through-out.	2003-04-22

A lonely boy and his only pal. It kind of built up a picture of two kids teaming up to find a sea monster who kidnaps children. Plus it is set in 1977, which indicated some sort of nostalgic appeal to me, but it ends up being  a bit pointless.<br /><br />My guess is that this book is mostly a true story. Sonya Hartnett states that Adrian (our main, and lonely character) is very much based on her (in 1977 she would have been Adrian's age) and her reaction to the Japanese finding a sea monster would be identical to Adrian's. Considering that the story doesn't really go anywhere the whole thing seems to be some sort of vanity project. There is no point in really anything that happens and it builds up to a questionable (though utterly heartbreaking) climax that links nothing together. The book is NOT about a sea monster. It's NOT about missing children. It's NOT about 1977.<br /><br />It's set in an unidentified Australian suburb in a cold fall where Adrian wanders around watching things and never being a part of them. He feels so totally alone and friendless. Then a new family of kids move in over the street and he strikes up an 'iffy' friendship. From here things become bleaker and bleaker until the depressing ending seems the only possible conclusion.  While it may be a negative ending I guarantee that you'll never forget it.<br /><br />Perhaps my assumptions of what the book would be about led to disappointment. And maybe a realistic story full of dead ends is better than something fantastical and fake. The realistic approach is good for kids (not necessarily a kid's book I must add) and I'm glad there is a book accessible to children that isn't all fun and games and magic.<br /><br />What The Birds See (the title puzzles me) is full of despair and torment. And trust me, no child or adult will be cheering at the ending.	2003-03-15

I had never heard of Calvin and Hobbes and ever since sitting with this book in the garden all day in the sun I have loved it ever since.<br /><br />It's not really a humor accessible to children, such as Garfield, but humor for adults based on a child's unique view on the world.

No matter what your age Calvin and Hobbes will always remind you of the innocence of childhood and the outrageous imagination within.	2003-03-01

Across the whole inner-sphere there is no communication between planets (hence 'Dark Age') and the Republic fears that isolation and no communication will lead to worlds being overtaken by tyrants. And it is Sam's job to make sure that doesn't happen on the rainforest world of Basalt.<br />It sounds intriguing but there is hardly any action and when it does finally happen it's not described in a particularly engaging way which is a shame. What we end up with is a Tom Clancy novel set in the Battletech/Mechwarrior universe.<br />This is how the novel ends up being a real mixed bag. While it is a good way for non-fans to be introduced to the Battletech/Mechwarrior universe it isn't such a great or meaningful story. Tho Stackpole seems to think the novel should be held in higher regard and writes it in such a way that could be interpreted as arrogance.<br />Written in the first-person perspective the Narrator Sam/Mason makes quite a few remarks near the beginning about how we are reading a fine piece of literature. Now this may be a bit of sarcastic humor that Stackpole is playing on us but a pulp novel that is no more than a spin-off from the Battletech franchise is NOT fine literature. Trust me kids, study this for your English papers and you will likely fail.<br />Tho it is a BIT better written than one would expect from a novel of such origins and the 39 chapters are all separated in 7 pages slices with a small, but relevant, quotation opening each of them. And, as with most novels of this character, the first-person narrative is useless and nothing would be lost if the book were told in omnipotence. There is no REAL personal side to the narrator. He may be a cool character but there is no point in it just being HIS story.<br />Read if you like Battletech/Mechwarrior or want to be introduced to the universe. Stay away if you have desires to read some of the other, better, entries.e other, better, entries.	2003-02-20

Artemis lacks his evil side and appears to have turned over a new leaf. I didn't particularly like this as I found him to be much more interesting as a villain.<br /><br />However, the villains this time round are the Russian Mafia, Cudgeon, and Opal Koboi. Now Artemis, Butler, Holly, and Root must join forces and help each other out if these foes are to be beaten. It sounds interesting but in it's relentlessly fast pace coherence and logic are lost. Colfer doesn't describe particular scenes very well (the chaos on the radioactive train, the siege outside police plaza) and it's a bit of a confusing read. Plus whenever the plot cuts to Foaly's trouble it slows too much.<br /><br />It was cool to see the return of Mulch Diggums tho and his subplot of stealing a whole collection of Academy Awards is interesting enough to not distract from the main action. Tho the character's I have problems with are Root and Butler. They never really seem to do much or have any depth. Butler is basically a machine with no character, his sister Juliet was okay in the first book but both she and Mrs Fowl are missing from this entry.<br /><br />Colfer really ought to describe the action more vividly as without decent description the excitement is lost. I still look forward to the forthcoming Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code and I would still recommend this to those who enjoyed the first. It's not as good but still worth it. My copy is the hardback with the glittery wraparound cover, get that one, it looks really neat. 3.5/5	2003-02-14

But he returns near the end to explain the mystery to all involved.<br />While it is better than Conan-Doyle's short stories in terms of a stronger narrative and a larger mystery `Hound of the Baskervilles' still suffers from long, ludicrous and unrealistic monologues and superficial contrivances. As always the story is told from the point of view of Watson. But it simply isn't a unique enough point of view to make the first person narrative worth it.

The mystery and characters are so much more involving than they were in the second in this time there is yet another Defense Against the Black Arts teacher; Prof. Lupin. Who has been my fave teacher so far. Plus the Quidditch matches are more entertaining thanks to Harry's new broom.<br />Tho I did kind of figure out Hermione's secret and Lupin's illness right away. But the way they are woven into the climax is pretty clever. And this time there actually IS a climax. Last time I felt like it was more of a poor excuse to tie up loose-ends and full of unconvincing exposition. Not so here I'm pleased to say, this is a better mystery with a better ending.<br />Tho longer than Chamber of Secrets I find that this installment is quicker with more humor and sarcastic wit. I hope that JK Rowling keeps this up with the rest of the series as it is needed to balance out all the dark elements. I haven't read Goblet of Fire yet but I hope it's just as cool. But for now, Prisoner of Azkaban gets a definite 5/5	2002-12-22

Out of all the books I have ever read only this and 'Sunset Song' have been the most overwritten. In what could be potentially and entralling read, Lovecraft ruins 'At the Mountains of Madness' with outrageously pointless over-description and straying too far off the point. One might argue that he's building up suspense and only 'hinting' at certain terrors but nothing scared or interested me. Plus he repeats himself over and over and leaves gaping plot holes (What happened to Lake? What of the rest of the men back at the camp? How on earth did they transport planes down there?). Tho conveniently for him his fictional (?) creation of the Necronomicon helps him along with his dull tale.<br />Who is telling the story? It's told in the first person perspective but he never gives his name. Plus there is no dialogue in this book either. There isn't any decent character development or anyone to side with. And the ending is one of the biggest anti-climaxes I have ever read. That's once we actually get to it! In the last 3rd Lovecraft spends a shocking amount of time on very far-fetched contrivences, it's hard to believe.<br />It's obvious tho that John Carpenter based his movie 'The Thing' more on this than on the original movie that it is supposed to be a remake of. The creatures described as 'Shoggoths' are definitely what inspired Rob Bottin's creation in said movie. Tho they aren't scary in this book I must stress.<br />This print also included a story called 'The Shunned House' which I think is more entertaining despite the lack of dialogue again. Tho this time the character is polite enough to tell you his name. It's an interesting story with some great potential tho once again the ending is a let down.<br />'Dreams in the Witch House' is another first-person story which again uses the Necronomicon as a hokey plot device. It's a boring story.<br />'The Statement of Randolph Carter' is a smart little tale which ends this short anthology with more wit than the rest of it put together.<br />In short, if you are new to Lovecraft then I wouldn't suggest ATMOM. It's only for die-hard fans or true horror enthusiasts. It may well have been revolutionary and scary in it's day but now it's just dull and boring.it put together.<br />In short, if you are new to Lovecraft then I wouldn't suggest ATMOM.

The story was also far too straight-forward and went through all the usual motions of Predator crossovers. This sequel though, is MUCH better, featuring bright, colorful artwork, more interesting characters and a more complex plot that has three Preds stalking around Gotham City.<br /><br />The character of Huntress is also quite hot. For an animation she sure does have a nice ass and cleavage. It's a shame she and the Bat never got it on, but there's little time for that when a group of assassins and an alien are after you. The Pred obviously makes light work of the hired killers, saving the pleasure of killing Bats all for himself in a showdown more cinematic than the first time around.<br /><br />It's long out of print, so you'll have to pick it up used somewhere. The back cover lists a £4.99 rrp. I feel so OLD, were they EVER that cheap? Two lengthy forewords by the editors precede the story.	2002-12-08

The artwork in particular is very atmospheric and draws you right into the environment. In this series (which ran from Dec 96 to Mar 97) the Predator has set up in Fleener Creek, OR and he's laying waste to rednecks, cops and a busload of escaped convicts. It's up to the spunky Sherrif's daughter to sort him out and send him packing. If Dark Horse kept up this standard of output regarding the franchise no doubt it wouldn't be dead in the water today.

There is something happening on every page so that you never get bored. I read 90% of this book in one sitting and the rest the next morning (I needed my sleep). There is no over-description or indulgence here. It's a story told quickly and smartly.<br />And I really cannot understand any of the negative reviews here. There are no REAL good guys or bad guys in this book. Everything is rather evenly balanced. So when people moan about Artemis Fowl being a nasty little boy and a villain and so on it really puzzles me. This book is written to be accessible to all ages, so when adults cannot get into the story it's a bit odd.<br />The plot twists, while intelligent and clever, are NOT hard to follow. You'll be almost oblivious to them practically if you turn the pages as quickly as I did. I like the idea of setting it in Ireland and a 12 year old boy as the lead makes it appealing to kids moreso. My fave character tho was Foaly, the gadget-fixated centaur. I worry tho that maybe the presence of so much super high-tech gadgetry might date the book badly in a few years to come. It's cool to see fairies using plasma screens and surveillance cameras but the original Star Trek series looks badly dated now in retrospect and I worry that the same thing might befall Artemis Fowl. It's a shame because this really ought to be a timeless book.<br />I'm certainly looking forward to the sequel. And if you like fantasy novels or intelligent fiction for all ages then quickly pick up a copy of Artemis Fowl. I got the hardback copy with the glittering sparkles all over the cover. And it looks way cool.	2002-11-27

I liked it, but for some reason I dropped it halfway through and never went back to it (until now). I only remembered vague parts of the story and every time I scanned my shelves for my next read the fact that I had left this novel unfinished seemed to mock and ridicule me. So now, over 18 years later, it was time to give it another go. And I recall why I stopped reading.<br /><br />Josh Spiller is a trucker with a nagging girlfriend who seems to enjoy his simple life of hauling goods around the US of A. Then she announces that she is pregnant and is getting an abortion. Josh freaks out and drives away, desperate for any work to take his mind of things. Somewhere in Virginia he ends up in what should be the dingy, hick-town of Furnace but is actually affluent in a Beverly Hillbillies kind of way. A nasty crunching sound is followed by an escalating nightmare as Josh accidentally runs over and flattens a newborn baby.<br /><br />Wracked by guilt and confusion Josh takes off, picking up a wayward hitchhiker along the way for company and spontaneous sex. This was the point where I dropped the novel back in 1998. It cuts back to his girlfriend and their wacky Korean neighbor way too much. All of this should have been excised. As soon as Josh left the house to quickly take up a new job we should never have seen the girlfriend again, it distracts way too much from the main plot. If Muriel Gray had done so it would have lopped about 40 pages off the page count and would have made for a tighter, more concise novel.<br /><br />Also, there are times when even her own travels across the US cannot provide enough authenticity in the dialogue and inner thoughts of the characters. Hun, American's don't refer to &#34;car boot sales&#34;. The story becomes supernatural, hokum nonsense in the second half but it's still very entertaining and keeps you hooked. Furnace might make for a decent movie some day, and I'm surprised it has not so far. A fun read, especially for those with experience of traversing America's backwater oddities.sed it has not so far.

Still tho, I like Holmes and he gets plenty of room here to show off his skills.<br /><br />These stories are presented in chronological order of their publication in 'Strand' magazine and follow immediately after 'A Study in Scarlet' and 'The Sign of Four'. Tho their timelines bounce around all over the place and it's hard to keep track.<br /><br />My fave stories would be 'The Speckled Band' or 'The Engineer's Thumb'. Both of which are from 'Adventures'. The only story I really enjoyed from 'Memoirs' is 'The Silver Blaze'. Many of them seem to be rehashes of his older plots.<br /><br />Tho highly regarded in the literary community I find Conan-Doyle's writing style to be confusing and inappropriate. As most of you know the stories are told from the point of view of Watson, Holmes' sidekick. But his narration of the events takes a backseat to very, very lengthy dialogues (which are mostly overwritten monologues). The narrative shifts back and forth and all over the place. It's not uncommon to see '''\\" before a typical line of speech. If you get lost, don't worry...I did too. The story 'The Musgrave Ritual' especially is badly told, plain and simple.<br /><br />Plus Watson's function in most of this hardly ever reaches out of 'The Casual Observer'. All he does is witness Holmes' crime-solving techniques. Which usually only last a couple of pages as most of each story (typical length 21 pages) devotes about 13 pages to set-up. Hardly well balanced is it?<br /><br />The last story 'The Final Problem' isn't even a mystery at all and just seems like a badly thought-out excuse for Conan-Doyle to kill of a character he felt totally indifferent about. Even tho the public loved Holmes. Why Moriarty is seen as a massive villain is beyond me because he hardly does anything at all.<br /><br />The overall quality of the short stories is average. The full novels is where Holmes and Watson REALLY have something to other than fool around in low-level stories. You'll definitely be interested in some of the stories in this certain edition, but they lack meaning or purpose.<br /><br />This particular edition comes with extensive notes at the back with numbers for each story to help clear up any confusion. Some of them are helpful for when you are reading and the rest give away plot points and ruin some of the developments.<br /><br />As I am a Holmes completest I stuck it out and finished every one of these stories. If you are too then I'd recommend this Penguin edition over the others. They seem to always print the best copies of Holmes.nd Watson REALLY have something to other than fool around in low-level stories.

I've never read another book with such a straight-foward and plain mystery. I hope the rest of the series isn't going to be this way.<br />A mystery novel should set up the clues in contradiction of each other. The pieces here go together so easily that it ruins any intrigue there could have been. And now that we know our way around Hogwarts and know all the characters and teachers their should be a lot more room for more mystery and new ideas. But that doesn't happen.<br />It's rather weird that 'Chamber of Secrets' is longer than the first yet contains less mystery, imagination and invention. Even the final showdown is very basic and totally without spark. But if you liked the first then give it a shot.	2002-11-16

My copy is the Deluxe hardback of 'The Philosopher's Stone' with the velvet pagestrap. I prefer it to the cartoonish American copy with the illustrations.<br />Too many people tell me that they do not want to read the Harry Potter books because they are overhyped. Well, they are. But they are not oversold. It's such a relief to see a children's book with such imagination and invention. Most of them seem to insult their intelligence or have dated characters. But the Harry Potter series takes place in it's own universe with it's own laws.<br />I found this first novel to have a better mystery and set of circumstances than 'The Chamber of Secrets'. Some of the characters here did not seem to have a decent amount of space in the sequel. I haven't read 'Prisoner of Azkaban' yet but I hope that Hagrid, Dumbledore and even the Dursleys (comic relief) get a bit more room.<br />If you're afraid that you won't enjoy the Harry Potter series because you are totally unfamiliar with them and feel kind of behind the rest of the fans then I must assure you that this novel is a gradual and enjoyable initiation. It's not a birth of fire, trust me. Everything is easy to get to grips with and sets up the characters for deeper story developments. If you want an introduction to this universe then 'The Philosopher's Stone' is a great start. Some say that you can read the Harry Potter books individually but I can't see the sense in this. Buy this 'un. You'll very much enjoy it and want more.	2002-11-16

Nathan Archer even goes as far as adding some scenes that give Schaefer's partner Rasche a bit more character and few more things to do.<br /><br />The plot is what Predator 2 was originally supposed to be. Arnie's character was supposed to be helping the NYPD with a drugs war in an unbelievably hot summer. But when Arnie couldn't schedual in between Total Recall and Terminator 2 the role was re-written for Danny Glover. So the story here is pretty much as much a decent continuation of the first movie as the film sequel is. But with one big difference...<br />the role of Dutch Schaefer is changed to Detective Schaefer, Dutch's brother. He's just as big, bad and burly. And guess what...he goes by his own rules. If there was ever a REAL inspiration for 'McBain' from The Simpsons...it's probably Detective Schaefer. While reading the book I couldn't help but think of a Rainer Wolfcastle-type hero.<br /><br />I've never read many action-based novels and I never knew how they'd work. But Predator: Concrete Jungle does manage to be exciting and is a real page turner. It's a pretty thick book but I managed to finish it in about 3 days. I know this isn't particulary fast but I'm not the kind of guy who can spend all day reading.<br /><br />Not unless what I am reading is interesting or has a reason keep me reading to the end. And this book is definitely all that. The follow-up, Predator-Cold War, is even better. But I do recommend that if you like the Predator movies and comic books that you check out the novels. There are quite few of them and they are well worth it.	2002-07-28

The bright, gaudy colors, the bad humor, the nonsense, the poor dialogue. Even from an artistic viewpoint this entry seems more like a bad TV-movie compared with the more cinematic first two.<br /><br />The Pred has returned...again...to Gotham City and is once more chopping up bad guys. Batman villains pop in from time to time, do nothing, then disappear again. Other regular characters barely get a look-in or vague reference at best. Bats does virtually no detective work and Robin gets very little to do until the last act. It's all too fast, too familiar, and too shallow. Instead of giving us an epic battle between the two icons (as the title would imply) we just get a bunch of filler scenes and little else.<br /><br />They try to cover up their shortcomings with pathetic attempts at self-referential humor, but to the jaded (wise) reader it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Only buy to finish off your collection. It's certainly ain't no masterpiece.	2002-07-21
US	52239651	R2T7C6SRXCOWSR	0140302093	401593496	Marianne Dreams (Puffin Books)	Books	4	6	16	N	N	A Bit Old-Fashioned	And a bit odd too. Parts of the story that are supposed to be scary just end up being merely curious. I mean I would not be scared by a boulder with an eye. Nor would I constantly eat sausages, like Marianne and Mark do. And they are particularly fond of the word \\"beastly\\". Every second sentence contains this word.<br /><br />I won't go into detail about the story as the other reviews provide enough info but I will say that the book differs from the film ([[ASIN:B00005KFTT Paperhouse [Region 2]]], in which Marianne becomes Anna Madden) greatly. It doesn't feel as menacing nor does Marianne have the same kind of cockiness and early-adulthood intelligence she has in the film. Instead, she's a year younger and seems more childlike. The story of Marianne's being absent and having him appear in her dreams as a madman is not here either. The evil forces take the form of monolithic stones with eyes. And the stones chase Marianne and Mark?!<br /><br />Very weird indeed, I'm not quite sure how the physics of that works. It's probably all subtext. But I can't figure it out. The ending is also completely different from the film too.<br /><br />I wish this book was darker and had a bit more evil in it. The boulders with eyes just don't do it for me. It didn't feel threatening at all. Altogether this a bit of a disappointment. It's not fully engaging or mysterious and seems too tame. I can't figure out what audience Catherine Storr was writing for but it seems a little unmagical for kids and a too tame for adults. Maybe it was different back in 1958.<br /><br />A sequel, [[ASIN:0571113362 Marianne and Mark (Fanfare)]], was written but is very hard to find. I still recommend this book, the sequel and the two live action adaptations.	2002-07-13
US	52239651	R4CM98WJ5PUYW	0345337964	380958991	Garfield in Paradise	Books	4	4	4	N	N	One of the better Garfield full-color stories.	When Garfield learns that John is taking him and Odie on vacation he dreams of a wonderful paradise escape but that isn't to be. They're travelling 3rd class to an El-Cheapo resort on an island where the natives worship the only car the rental place has to offer.<br />Why do the worship it? Because once, many years ago, the local volcano threatened to go off and destroy their tribe. A stereotypical 50's rebel teen drove his classic car (the exact same one John has rented) into the volcano to keep the gods happy.<br />Now the volcano is getting angry again and the natives expect John to drive into the volcano just like the James Dean guy did before!<br />The book is full of bright and colorful pictures and Garfield's orange and black fur definitely looks better here than in the black and white pocket books. There are other full-color Garfield stories (such as Garfield in the Rough, Garfield on the Town), but this is one of the best.<br />Recommended for adults and children who love that cat.	2002-06-03
US	52239651	RA4NYRGCE6WD4	0881108901	468048092	Dragon Quest (Fantasy Adventure Games Series)	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Very, very hard	Dragon Quest is kind of like \\"Where's Waldo\\", only much harder. The story concerns a race of small folk who's hair is stolen by an evil wizard. Four of them come together to go on a mission to get their hair back. We, have to spot the supplies, friends and enemies in immensely detailed pages of vivid artwork.<br /><br />Me and my sister read this book (or played it rather) and let me tell you, every time her back was turned I flicked to the answer pages to find what I was looking for. \\"Where's Waldo\\" is easy. THIS, is impossible. The stuff you have to look for sometimes doesn't even look like what it is supposed to.<br /><br />There are many other books in this series and if you did well in this one (I didn't) then I would consider checking the others out. My hat goes off to the illustrator (Nick Harris) for his stunning drawings. But this is too hard for me.	2002-05-23
US	52239651	R1PQ2TP9JWH7L9	0684171600	404458421	Treasure Island	Books	1	7	35	N	N	Awful!	How can this possibly be a classic? Most of the time I had no idea what on earth the characters were saying. It's all in some kind of pirate-jive lingo. Practically a foriegn language. I thought that this was a childrens book. If I read this at the age of let's say 8, it would put me off reading for life. And it is so slow to start. I didn't enjoy reading this book and I was very disappointed. The drama is weak, the narrative is weak and boring. I felt nothing for the hero Hawkins. And towards the end it kind of built up to a big climax that never happened. I'd like to believe I read a fake version of Treasure Island and there is a much better and real version out there. But perhaps I should accept that this book, cherished and highly regarded by a lot of people, just didn't entertain me one iota.	2002-05-23
US	52239651	R1ZR7CVTNU18HK	0140439080	111782299	A Study in Scarlet (Penguin Classics)	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Interesting start to the Holmes phenomena.	I seriously raced thru this book as it was highly addictive. Holmes is brilliantly introduced to us and to Watson. Once Holmes lets a room out in his house to Watson the intrique starts. Doc is suspicous of what Holmes does and is keen to join him on his cases. When a man is found dead in a seedy house in suburban London the mystery kicks in.<br />Holmes uses his awesome methods of deduction to bring the killer straight into his hands. But then the story takes an unexpected and mostly inappropriate turn. We go back a few decades to the Salt Flats of Utah and follow the story of 2 lost travellers and how they are saved by fachist Mormons. It's all to unfamiliar and un-Holmes and I was glad to get it over with and back to Holmes mysteries and case-solving.<br />I guess that Conan-Doyle never knew where the character of Holmes would go after this. The short stories and novels that followed were much better and developed some of the minors characters. But every &quot;franchise&quot; has to start somewhere. I assume Conan-Doyle never imagined that Holmes would have lasted so long and parodied and imitated to much, even to this day. But this is where it all started. And it got better and better from here on.	2001-11-21
US	52239651	R1XMOJ6MGB6G2Z	0061055662	405774914	Aliens Predator Customizable Card Game: Alien Resurrection Expansion Set	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Great Package	Buying this box will mean that you save money by buying all the cards at once instead of getting them seperatly without the chance of getting all the rare cards.<br />Harper Prism made an okay start with this CCG. The original series had some gameplay problems and the artwork on the cards was shoddy. But the new gameplay and artwork introduced here is much better. It's a shame that public interest in the game has faded away because this game could have risen to the level of Magic or Star Trek.<br />But this expension set mixed with the first series still makes for an enjoyable CCG. Buy it before it's gone.	2000-10-20
US	52239651	R2TBNR2DAOSTXT	999754496X	701078002	Sunset Song	Books	2	16	28	N	N	Can anyone say &quot;Padded&quot;?	It was a LONG 241 pages let me tell ya. I so much agree with the other Scottish reviewer who said that Gibbon (who lends his name to one of the characters) stretches out simple sentences over 2 paragraphs. This becomes VERY annoying and I screamed out loud &quot;Get to the point, man!&quot;.<br />The book starts off well though. Some characters are okay and some pointless. There are too many characters that are never fully explained and it is very easy to get them mixed up with someone else. At about a 3rd into the book interest dies out quickly. Nothing much is put into words and then spread over 2-3 pages.<br />Gibbon's command of the english language is also shockingly bad. I know the characters are supposed to be talking in old scots but still...I know this dialect...and many, many sentences DO NOT make any sense. It is possible to miss out many paragraphs, that mean nothing and are put in there for no reason, and not miss any vital plot elements. Not that there actually IS a plot. It's just about a girls life at the beginning of the 20th century and how the war changes everything.<br />The subtext about &quot;only the land endures&quot; is not true, senseless and totally out of place. Is so much does not work. I give this book 2 stars for the promising beginning. But nothing is going to make me forgive the last 2 3rds.	2000-10-17
