One thing about Wayne, however, is that despite his writings about ego, and how it has no place in this world, etc, I've always found him to be a bit of an egomaniac.  I always had that sense about him, that although he talked a good game, he himself didn't follow exactly what he preches.<br /><br />Although this book was written in 2000, I didn't realize Wayne Dyer had a heart attack.  I distinctly remember in one of his speeches several years back, Wayne told the audience, \\"I will never get sick with cancer or have a heart attack because my mind is not like that of someone who creates these conditions for themselves.\\"  Basically, suggesting that your mind creates cancer or heart disease.  Well, did Wayne all of a sudden create his heart attack?<br /><br />The guy means well, and we can apply, and learn some valuable lessons from his writing, but my initial gut reaction of him turned out to be at least somewhat true.  No one is perfect... but Wayne would have made you think he was up until he wrote this book.  I just can't buy the proposed information from an egomaniac, who claims he's anything but one.	2005-03-12

It's all right on the money, and 100% true.  However, the problem I have with the book, is that while Eckhart explains why we should quiet our minds, he doesn't really explain the best ways we can apply this knowledge into the real world, here in the 21st century.<br /><br />This book is written, based on the same exact principles that made the author famous.  His \\"The Power of Now\\" books, which were fantastic.  This book offers pretty much nothing new, but a condensed version of his other books.  However, this book lacks the \\"How to\\" that his other books do.  I wouldn't mind seeing a few chapters on how we can fit this sort of thinking into our real world lives.  How we can quiet our minds in certain situations, with examples.  The information in the book is solid, but I know personally, and from speaking to others, we're thirsting for more upon completion.  Almost as if we got the message, but have no clue how to apply it properly to our lives.	2005-03-06

I couldn't even weed through all of the needless information in order for this book to make an impact on me.  I was reading, and kept drifting off, because I simply didn't care about most of what he was saying.  I wanted to become a 'Great Communicator'.  Instead, I found my patience was being tested!  I don't recommend this book for anyone who doesn't want to know every little nit picking detail about certain things like the origins of language, and certain common sense things, which he explains in FULL detail.<br /><br />No need for this book.	2005-03-06

Even before the steroid craze in baseball's public eye began, we all knew he was a juicehead.  But to actually come out like this, and admit that he was only a major league calibur player because of the juice was a pretty bold move.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to get this book, and I dove right into it, and read it cover to cover as soon as I got back home from the bookstore.  I don't know what I was expecting, but I wanted some dirt... and dirt I received.  The book doesn't name as many names as I thought it would, but it did enough to damage the reputations of a select few to last a lifetime.<br /><br />While the book is controversial, it points things out that have been pretty obvious, if you know anything about steroids, what they do, and how they work.  As Jose points out, if you looked at McGwire and Sosa during their home run hitting peaks, they were very bloated, as they gained weight too quickly (water weight).<br /><br />Many say Canseco's credibility is shot (or non-existant), but I believe this book to be pretty much right on the money.  Several issues may have been exaggerated to help sell more books, but overall, I believe it 100%.  Excellent read, and I urge any baseball fan to take a look.	2005-02-14

Books	5	14	15	N	N	Everything a salesman needs to know, and more	It amazes me that a few reviewers on here have stated that these sales techniques are outdated.  The human mind has no evolved greatly over the past 20+ years, so why does selling have to change?  As Zig points out, it's all about control, psychology, word phrasing and tones, confidence, etc.  If you're a salesman and you're using slick, state of the art, 21st Century tactics, you're probably not being an honest salesman, bottom line.<br /><br />This book has everything you need to know.  I mean, EVERYTHING.  Some might not like Zig's writing style.  It's really rough around the edges, but easy to understand.  He likes to go off track, make constant \\"redhead\\" references, and in the book, he also makes outdates references, such as selling cookware door to door.  But that doesn't take away from the points the book is trying to nail home.  I became at least twice as confident and more educated about selling after I read this book.  I'm willing to bet a beginning salesperson will increase their income by 100% with this book.	2005-02-04

People do it for energy, health, and to be fit.  People cringe at the thought of an intense muscle burn, or going to absolute failure.  Well, with this program, you will receive the most intense muscle burns, and expend the most effort you ever have before in your life, guaranteed.<br /><br />The workouts are brief, but they are TOUGH.  Even though you may have 2-3 more reps in you, you'll want to quit because the burn is so intense.  When you finally succumb to exhaustion after your set, your brain says, \\"No way!\\" and you associate working out with pain.  I just can't see how someone will stick with this kind of workout long term.<br /><br />Now... does this workout save time?  Yes.  Sure does.  Does it work as well as standard exercise routines?  I'm not sure.  It works, yes, but as well as standard routines?  The jury is still out on that one.  One thing is for sure, it doesn't work BETTER, but you invest much less time.  If you're strapped for time, have tremendous will power, and don't care about intense pain, then you should give this workout a whirl.  If not, don't even bother.	2005-01-12

Solid info, but some of it is totally inapplicable to many salesmen (me included).  Setting up the appointment is great, and it's what we all want to do as salespeople.  However, for many salesman, just blindly setting up an appointment within 20 seconds of speaking with a person is foolish.  There's no mention of qualifying the people you're speaking with.<br /><br />The book IS movitational, and offers many helpful insights, such as tracking your calls, making sure you make your calls every day, etc.  It just wasn't what I expected.	2004-12-26

Not this one.  Gabriel Cousens touched on something very interesting, which I totally agree with, having suffered from depression myself.  The foods you choose to eat have a profound impact on your moods.  Certain foods, eaten regularly enough could precipitate panic attacks, sleepiness, withdrawal, etc.<br />Gabriel breaks it down into two categories... fast and slow oxidizers, when speaking of the proper diet.  There's a questionairre, which makes it very easy for you to discover which type you are.<br />There is also a section on nutrients for the brain, nervous system, and those that may elevated the mood.  However, much like the diet, there are certain nutrients that will help certain kind of imbalances, and not others.  Might sound complicated, but the information is thorough enough to make anyone understand it.<br />Last but not least, there are recommendations to help overcome self destructive behavior, negative thinking, and patterns of laziness.<br />All in all, quite an excellent book, most certainly one of the best I've ever read on depression.  Sure, your depression problem may not be an imbalance due to improper food choices, but then again, it could be the ONLY problem, as it was for myself.	2004-06-22

Lately, his books have become more and more interesting to read, as more of the truth is being exposed.  In Gary's books of yesteryear, he had a tendancy to back off, and only give you the basics.  Not so anymore.<br />This book is exceptional.  I certainly haven't read anything as good on the subject.  I especially love the affirmations section of the book, where he outlines 411 unique perspectives on life in general.  They're not your basic affirmations that would say something like, &quot;I am a loving person&quot;.  They're truthful, insightful facts that you can apply to your life on a daily basis.<br />In the book, Gary also outlines what supplements are good for anxiety and depression.  He also recommends juicing and detoxing the liver as a key part of overcoming these two common diseases.<br />Like I said before, it has to be the more informative, truthful book I've read to date on the subject.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who feels a little down on their luck, or to people who have manic depression.  You can't go wrong with this book and these recommendations.	2004-02-20

A diet book that isn't too restrictive, and it's relatively healthy.  I'm certainly no advocate of the Atkins Diet, and diets like the Raw Food Diet, and the Alkaline Diet can be far too restrictive for most people to be able to deal with effectively.<br />The South Beach diet is about as healthy as a diet can get while still allowing certain processed, and devitalized foods into your body.  Of course, only fresh foods, organic if possible are recommended on this diet, but there's different variations you can come up with to make the diet work for you.  That's why I would recommend this book to someone who doesn't want to give up meat, or some of the foods they like to eat on a daily basis.<br />I'd have to say if a reader can't follow this South Beach diet with any success, perhaps you should start looking at Self-Help books and tapes instead.  Wayne Dyer does some fine work in that field.  Check him out if you feel cheated and restricted on the South Beach diet.	2003-12-26

Our immune system are often overlooked, and one might think that taking extra vitamin C may do the trick.  Not so.<br />Dr. Chen has an impressive background, and her credentials are more than enough for anyone to take this book seriously.<br />The book itself is basic.  It doesn't get heavy duty into what makes the immune system what it is, but for the lay person, it's extremely valuable information that will open your eyes to alternatives you can take, and things you can do to avoid heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, just to name a few.<br />Nicely done.	2003-10-23

Building Strength and Muscle Naturally	Books	4	5	9	N	N	This is my review for the New 3rd Edition	Amazon doesn't yet have the 3rd edition of this book for sale, but when they do, this review will be legit.<br />The book has been expanded a little and changed around a little bit in this new edition.  It hasn't been expanded with any really valuable information though.  The newest chapter is all about the supplement line that Nature's First Law carries!!!  An entire chapter in a book for marketing purposes.  That's our hard earned money paying for his advertisements.<br />With that said, the content of this book has been updated and improved upon.  In the 1st Raw Power book, Arlin suggested that eating sweet fruit would make you skinny.  He's changed his stance on that to say that eating sweet fruit several times per day will make you skinny.  The latter is the truth.  Your metabolism will fly out of whack if you have several sweet fruit meals per day.  That was an excellent correction.<br />Also, some of the new recipes are very good, and very practical.  They aren't just overly fatty recipes for the most part.  They have some fruit ones, and some pretty interesting mixtures that I intend on trying right away.<br />Arlin speaks a lot of truth in the fact that when he says you can't gain any muscle if you're 98% raw.  You need to be 100% or else your body will drain water out of your system to break down the 2% of cooked food that you eat.  It sounds radical, but it's totally accurate.<br />I love this book (advertisements aside), and would suggest it to anyone...	2003-08-07

Understanding Your Life's Energy	Books	2	3	7	N	Y	Excellent concept, but a little too scatterbrained	After you read the intro to this book, you realize that Gary knew he had something to share when he thought of the ideas in witin these pages.  He must have gotten overly excited, however, because the ideas expressed throughout this book are all over the place.<br />Basically, each one of us falls into one of 6 types (I believe it was).  He goes into great detail about each one of the types, and even gives a questionnaire to determine which type you are.  However, the answers aren't very clear cut and after reading the book 2 times, I'm still not sure which type I am.  I thought I might have missed something the first time around, so I read it again.  I was more confused the second time.<br />I believe that each one of us has a dominant type, but on certain days, months, and even years of our lives, we can live comfortably within any of these other groups.  I'm in total agreement with another reviewer when he said that Gary put most people into one category because of the laziness that they show.  Anyone can be a &quot;Dynamic Aggressive&quot; or a &quot;Dynamic Assertive&quot; if they want to be.  It's all about how you view yourself and if you're willing to focus on your goals.  If you're lazy, you can accept the &quot;Adaptive Supportive&quot; title and live your life working a mediocre job and never chasing your dream.<br />This book has far too many flaws for me to recommend it.	2003-07-23

However, it really never went into the caloric ratios a certain body type needs to consume to find balance.<br />I'm a vata-pitta, but primarily a vata.  I was following a high carbohydrate, low fat diet, which I read in this book was definitely the wrong thing for a vata to be doing.  I needed more fat.  40% of my calories as a matter of fact.  I'd tried everything else, so I gave the 40/40/20 ratio a shot.  All I can say is, &quot;WOW&quot;.  Upping my fat intake way the key to finding balance through diet.  Not to say everyone should eat 40% of their calories from fat.  Only the vata type.  The Pitta (or fire) type should eat 50% or more from carbs, 30% protein, and 20% or less from fat.<br />If I would have read this book 2 years ago, I would have missed out on a lot of unnecessary trial and error.  Excellent book!	2003-07-15

I saw Matthew flexing for the camera, and thought, &quot;Wow, this guy is cheesy&quot;.<br />Well, about 1 Chapter into the book, I was sold.  This book lays out the TRUTH about everything food related and how it applies to the lives we live.  He speaks on how things really are in the slaughterhouse.  I found that chapter very disturbing, but it was good to know the truth.  It made me forever look at cuts of meat in a different light.<br />As profound and insightful as this book was, with its hard hitting data and info, I still laughed aloud several times throughout the book.  He's got a good sense of humor.<br />All in all, top notch read for any vegetarian, or anyone wishing to improve their quality of life.  His recovery from an incurable disease just puts the medical world to shame, and I love to see that.  Instead of robbing people, let's help people.	2003-07-02

I figured it was worth the $... price tag if I could kill the two hours, reading about my favorite wrestler.  The larger than life superhero I knew growing up.<br />As I dove into the book, I couldn't put it down.  I read about 160 pages before I boarded the plane, and I just had to keep on reading until it was done.  I was excited to really see what went on behind the scenes.  Like the real reason he left the WWF.<br />Behind all the glitz and the glamour, Hulk Hogan has a very inspirational story to tell.  At one point, he had to move back in with his parents while trying to become a wrestler.  After that, he was living out of a van, and spent his days lying on the beach because he didn't have a place to live.  It kinds of makes you think.

However, if you want to actually make one of these dishes, be prepared to spend a great deal of time in the kitchen \\"uncooking\\" these meals.<br />Most of the recipes call for a champion juicer and a excalibur food dehydrator, or both.  Right there alone, that's a $700 investment.  Sure, not as much as a really good oven, so that's really not a huge issue.  Some of these recipes require 6-12 hours to prepare.  Not like you can sit down and whip up one of these meals in a matter of minutes.<br />I don't like the fact that this book uses so many nuts and seeds.  The meals have a higher fat content than the Standard American Diet, which is already too high.  Yes, it's raw fat, but that doesn't make it healthy to consume mass quantities of it.  My other problem with these recipes is that they call for the use of too many dried (dehydrated) foods.  Eating too many dry foods will in time dry you out, or dehydrate the cells of your body.<br />This recipe guide is excellent to serve to guests and on special occasions, but I don't see the point in making these recipes part of your daily routine.  It's far too time consuming, and the healthiness is questionable.	2003-06-28

Candida Diet, IBS Diet, Paleo, Atkins, Vegetarian, Vegan, Fruitarian, 100% Raw Food, and so on.  I found flaws with all of these diets, as you really have to rely on your own inner wisdom to be able to make these diets work.  And of course, anyone who promotes such a high meat diet hasn't really done their homework.<br />However, Dr. Young in this pH Miracle book really opens new doors for those willing to improve their health and well being.  He lays it all out to you in lay language, and gives you step by step tools on becoming well.  His &quot;Alkalarian&quot; diet seemed flawed to me at first, because as a long time raw foodist, I saw that he recommended steaming some veggies, eating cooked grains, and cooked legumes.  However, after becoming frustrated with being 100% raw, I discovered a new sense of well being on this diet.  My body was craving alkalinity the whole time and according to him, fruit is to be used only for cleansing and in moderation.  It was always the mainstay of my diet.<br />Dr. Young promotes his supplement line in the book, which is bunk, but everybody has to make a living.  I understand the hardship of poverty, so I have no beef with this issue.<br />This diet is a cleansing, energizing diet that will open up the creativity and spirituality within you.  Watch how kind and loving you become.  Of course, you need to take care of the stress in your life, but this diet is the key to unlocking the doors that are keeping you from reaching higher levels of consciousness.

When you pick up a book about a diet, you want to read the goodies about what foods to eat and how to achieve optimal physical fitness.  It's not that easy.  This book is one of a kind in that it focuses on a lot more than diet.  In the true sense of what it means to be healthy, diet is only a small fraction of what a truly healthy person really is.  Don't get me wrong.  Raw foods are a key to unlocking the greatness within you, but it's more than that.  You have to find inner peace and change your thinking.  David Wolfe points this out in many of his chapters throughout the book.<br />I enjoy Wolfe's approach to wellness, although he got a little carried away with some of his suggestions as far as disease conditions are concerned.  I'm in total agreement with him as far as individualizing the diet according to your own needs, but then he goes and recommends certain ratios to overcome certain ailments.  If a 50% greens and 50% fats diet can help one person overcome candida, it's going to make another person more sick.  I was hoping to see more Ayurvedic type recomendations according to body type then to give generalized advice.  That's my only problem with this book.<br />I loved the sections on minerals, detox, and his positive, uplifting messages about life.  David Wolfe is a salesman, yes.  He's very good at marketing.  His unnecessary plugs to his website and to his product catalog didn't go unnoticed, but it could be very helpful to someone who lives in the middle of the woods and doesn't have access to some of the superfoods and formulas that can help you get off cooked foods.  Anyone who's raw knows it's not as easy as just giving up cooked foods cold turkey.  You need to ween yourself off cooked foods, just like drugs.  His products can be helpful with that.<br />All in all, great book.  Unlike anything else out there right now.  It could be improved upon, but for when it was written and for the powerful messages it delivers, it's one heck of a read.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  Even if you're not interested in becoming a raw foodist, you can still greatly benefit from reading this book.ad.  I'd recommend it to anyone.

If only I had this book in my possession 5 years ago when it was first written.<br />One extremely interesting concept of many that Gary lays out in this book is about daydreaming.  He tells us to keep a log of all of the things we daydream about.  Take note of the patterns that develop.  Then after reviwing this log, you will be able to decide what you truly want and desire out of life.  I've done this, and it literally knocked my socks off.

I was actually being \\"trained\\" by Steve Holman via email on this approach.  I was doing 30-45 second holds.  It worked great for strength, but I actually shrunk over an 8 week period.  My muscles felt strong, but flat.<br /><br />About 3 years later, I bought this book, and gave it another go-round.  I saw the authors were suggesting 5-10 second holds, which intrigued me.  I had been doing 30-45 second holds previously.  I started the workout, and 6 weeks later, I gave up, because I had lost 6 lbs -- all of it being muscle.  My biceps were down 1/2\\", chest was down a full inch, etc.  I was very disappointed, and even somewhat angry, because I looked noticeably smaller.  It was very weird, and didn't make sense to me, but that was the case.<br /><br />Fast forward a number of years later, and I read Pete Sisco's new eBook \\"Train Smart\\".  And I realized that there was an \\"Alpha\\" and \\"Beta\\" workout, and he mentioned that some people would need to do 3-5 sets of each exercise to build muscle on the program.  I was very intrigued again, and gave the program yet another shot.  Finally, for the first time ever, I began seeing results.  I started feeling like He-Man outside of the gym.  I started picking up heavy things, just because I felt like picking stuff up.  I started putting my girlfriend on my back and doing squats with her, because my legs felt so strong.  Just little stuff like that.<br /><br />What I came to realize after all of this, was that \\"real life\\" strength doesn't use full-range reps.  That's only for the gym.  When have you ever seen a construction worker curling a 4x6?  You don't.  He moves it in his strong range of motion a few inches, or holds it while nailing it.  We never, ever use full range reps in our daily lives, so why do them in the gym?  It's actually ridiculous when you think about it.<br /><br />But for me, this program DID NOT WORK, until I started doing 3-5 sets per exercise.  Instead of a 10 minute workout,  it now takes me 45 minutes to complete.  Big deal.  I work out twice a week for 45 minutes.  And I've gotten very broad, muscular, gained 17 lbs, and look and feel great.en you think about it.<br /><br />But for me, this program DID NOT WORK, until I started doing 3-5 sets per exercise.

I've bought numerous Wayne Dyer books and tapes before, and always loved his message.  This book intregued me, so I went ahead and read it.  The only conclusion I came up with was, &quot;Why would such a positive man write such a negative book?&quot;  Sure, this book tells an interesting story, but the story itself is the most depressing, and upsetting story I think I've ever read in my life.  It's the kind of book you read, maybe cry, and will upset you to no end.  It did for me.  Actually, I couldn't even finish reading this book because it was just too painful to read.

Why?  David Wolfe, Stephen Arlin, and the other Nature's First Law guys.<br />God's diet shouldn't be controversial.  I agree with what the authors are saying, but they say it in a way that makes you dislike them.  Drilling the message into your head like a drill sergeant that &quot;Cooked Food is Poison&quot; might do it for some, but not for me.  To me, these guys approach raw foodism as if it's a cult following.  Kind of like, &quot;Hey, jump on OUR bandwagon and live right.  Everyone else is living wrong.&quot;  They poke fun at every single diet on the planet, even vegans, who don't even eat animal products.<br />The abrasive way they deliver their message is unique, but it didn't do it for me.  Give me scientific data, not catch phrases and slogans.  Give me SOME science at all, not what is 'believed' to be the truth.  Do raw foods energize?  No doubt they do.  Is everyone who eats processed, devitalized foods poisoning themselves?  Yes, they are.  But are the ones who eat wholesome nutritious foods, mostly vegan, poisoning themselves?  No.  Poison is a harsh word.  Raw foodists can &quot;poison&quot; themselves even worse by overeating on sweet fruit, nuts, seeds, and aggravating a vata condition with the dieuretic action of the sweet fruits.  This isn't mentioned in this rah-rah book.<br />All in all, not a very good intro to raw foodism.  This diet is not a cult.  It's a healthy way of life, but you must know how to do it properly.  For this, I recommend &quot;Conscious Eating&quot; by Gabriel Cousens.	2003-01-04

He is one of those people who could \\"sell ice to an Eskimo\\".  This book is more than a marketing ploy, but he slips a lot of his slickness into it throughout the book.<br />First off, the Body for Life diet combines foods improperly, and can leave food fermenting in your stomach.  Not the best idea for someone who wants to get lean and lose fat.  Sure, exercise will increase your metabolism, and burn fat, but it all starts with proper digestion.<br />Secondly, this book is pretty much targeted at people who want to lose bodyfat.  Yet half of the people who would want to read this book are skinny, underweight males who want to bulk up.  The Body For Life workout is an aerobic workout, and it's hard to develop a lot of strength on it when you're already very slim.  Bill should have come up with a different workout for skinny people and fat people.<br />Other than that, this book is very good.  Very motivational.  If this book can't motivate you to change your life, nothing can.  I admire Bill for helping change so many people positively.	2002-12-26

That's the bottom line of this book.  It's true.  To recommend everyone eat the same way is insanity.  Books that are written like that should be banned from ever being published.  This book preaches individuality.  So we're off to a good start.<br />Other than the concept, this book is lousy.  The author doesn't really go into detail about how to individualize your diet accordingly.  Sure, he lists simple tests you can do, but I don't think suggesting drinking black coffee is a valid way of determining your body type.<br />This book has food lists of what is safe to eat for the three body types mentioned.  This section is good, gives you a good idea of what foods to eat if you're a fast or slow oxidizer.  But the author suggests eating fatty cuts of meat, drinking black coffee, and some other pretty unhealthy ways of \\"balancing\\" yourself.  To suggest something harmful to \\"balance\\" yourself is pretty insane.  I don't recommend this book.	2002-12-26

Robert Young is sold on the fact that we need to be alkaline in order to be healthy. I'm sold too, as well as any other person who has done any research on how to be healthy.<br />Young seems to be a big fan of Avocados as a source of \\"protein\\" (avocado is about 4% protein). If you've done other research, you know that an Avocado is toxic to a person with Type O blood.  Alkalizing it may be, but toxic to many, yes (about 60% of North Americans).  This is one issue I have beef with, but of course, not many would give credit to another author in their book, but D'Adamo's work on Blood Type Lectins should have been addressed.<br />Robert Young is not really a picture of health.  I initially found it difficult to take the health advice of a bald man with a pasty complexion.  But, he could have went bald 20 years ago for all we know.  I DO know it's possible to regrow hair in balding areas, as Gary Null has proven time and time again with members of his health support groups.<br />I commend Young on one issue: fruit.  For years, he was the ONLY one saying that fruit is acidifying.  People were mocking him, calling him a baffoon, etc.  I know, I was one of them.  Over time, more and more have come forward, agreeing with his theory.  It wasn't until Gabriel Cousens postulated the same theory, that I was sold on Young's initial findings.  I give him all the credit in the world for the fruit issue.  He is an innovator.<br />This book does an excellent job in promoting supplements his company sells. His supplements are good, and taking them will certainly benefit us all, but it seems a little biased when you make references to your own supplement line throughout the book. No other leading health advocate does that.<br />All in all, this book is extremely beneficial to anyone seeking to improve their wellness.  A raw food, alkaline diet as he suggests is the missing link in today's world.  If everyone in the world at like this, it would be a world of peace, love, and caring.  Tell enough people about this diet, and you are helping the world's cause.  I'm serious about this.

I've followed him for years, and his books &quot;Spiritual Nutrition...&quot; and &quot;Conscious Eating&quot; are two of the best books I've ever read on health, and I've read 100's.  When Cousens writes, I listen.  I respect him as a writer and as a person because he tells it like it is.  He'll say if he doesn't know, he'll voice his opinion.

This book COULD be in better detail of certain of the Tachyon methods of healing, but I'm sure a revised version will come out in the future.  If Tachyon is half of what the authors believe it to be, we may see the human lifespan go up to 160 years and beyond.<br />All in all, an exciting new look at a &quot;new&quot; discovery that just might be the key to unlocking the tremendous potential of the human species.

Why he doesn't do that in his books is a good question.<br />This book is chock full of information.  You can find information on pretty much any ailment, any herb, food, etc.  But the information on each subject is extremely limited.  Also, the information he gives out on these topics isn't his own.  Most of the time, it's Gary writing on someone else's opinion. For example, on ulcers, he said &quot;Martin Feldman, MD, recommends...&quot;  Most of the information and advice in this book is not his own.  Why he did this, I do not know.<br />I'm a huge Gary Null fan, but not a big fan of his books.  This book could be a lot better, for sure.  Not to say it isn't helpful, it is.

Her 12 Steps to overcome cooked foods isn't too spectacular, but the information within the book is solid.<br />I only have a few problems with this book.  First one being that she doesn't site any references from where she got the information about cooked foods, mucus, and all of the info she drills into our heads throughout the book.  While what she says may be 100% accurate, she fails to site the source of the information, as if she conducted laboratory studies herself.<br />My second problem with the book, is that the author doesn't look too healthy.  Her picture on the back shows that her skin is smooth and soft, her eyes bright, but her hair looks like it's basically lifeless.  She also looks very old, and I know she can't be too old with 2 children living in the house.  I always find information a little difficult to digest if the person giving it doesn't appear to be in radiant health.

The author of this book makes it seem as if we will all become champions by drinking water with a high pH.  This just isn't true, for several reasons.<br />The authors research is based on nothing.  It's based on his opinion, which is foolish.  He throws in a whole bunch of scientific jargon, as if its going to win us all over.  The fact is, drinking water with a high pH can be detrimental to your health, not positive.  Putting those drops in your water \\"clusters\\" the water, making the molecules smaller, thereby hydrating the body more than regular water.  This is bad because it tricks the body into overhydrating, and can wreak havoc in your stomach.  Dr. David Wheeler points this out on his site thoroughly.<br />Again, don't want to disappoint the fans of this theory, but there's a lot more to it than drinking alkaline water to become healthy.  Half the people who drink this water will become too alkaline, and could do some serious damage, like not producing stomach acid anymore.  It's happened to thousands.<br />I urge you all to do natural things.  Not use medication, like Alkaline water.  It IS indeed medicine.  The body WILL try to reject it.	2002-01-31

It combines pretty much every diet fad you've ever heard about into a raw, living food diet.<br />In this book, Cousens teaches us how to follow the Ayurvedic principles through a 80-90% raw food diet.  He also teaches us how to individualize our diets for our metabolic body types.  This is one of the only books I know that teaches how to individualize diet for a vegetarian.<br />The book covers religion, meditation, toxins in our environment, and has a nice living foods recipe section in the back of the book.  The nice thing about it, is that with the recipes, he doesn't try to offer dishes that are similiar to those which are cooked.  I see a lot of vegetarian recipe books doing that.  &quot;Try our delicious all vegan pizza!&quot; and of course, it tastes no better than a branch off of the Maple tree in my back yard.  These recipes offer new tastes.<br />I like a particular section in the book where Cousens tries to explain the logic behind why people think he looks much more unhealthy now than when he did when he was a bulky college football player.  We live in such an obesce society, that someone of a healthy weight appears too slim, or unhealthy.  Because Cousens doesn't have a pot belly, and sagging male breasts, many people say he looks &quot;thin and puny&quot;.  This book teaches us that  through living foods, we can sculpt and shape our bodies pretty much any way we'd like.  He chooses not to be muscular anymore, because he feels he has no need for 30 extra pounds of muscle. Steven Arlin on the other hand, is 230 lbs, and likes to feel big and strong.<br />All in all, this book takes you on a journey through the fascinating world of raw, living foods.

There's even more with diet.  Ayurveda is a new way of looking at what to eat.  When I applied which foods I was supposed to eat in what climate I was living in, I experienced a surge in energy, mental clarity, and well-being.  And that's only the diet aspect of the book.  Individuality is very important when speaking of diet.<br />This book also includes chapters on meditation, essential oils, massage, getting in touch with nature, freeing the mind from stress, etc.  It's an excellent book for a beginner or for seasoned veterans in the health field.  It just may change your opinion on MANY different issues.  It sure did for me.	2001-11-16

The author states that most disease is caused by dehydration in the body.  After reading this book, and reading others like it, I am now fully aware of the benefits of going on the &quot;Water Cure&quot; program.<br />We, as Americans, are scared to death of salt.  Millions of people frantically look on the back of Food Labels to see if they are 'allowed' to eat the food because of the sodium content.  True, regular table salt is not the best for us.  That's why we need to consume sea salt, with the 60 to 80 added minerals, in addition to the sodium.  When we do this, we can properly hydrate our bodies, and start curing all of our illnesses.<br />This is a fascinating book, and I urge anyone in ill health to read it.  If after reading this book, you are still afraid of sea salt and water, then you have other issues to deal with.  I would recommend any book by Wayne Dyer.	2001-10-13

After spending several hundred dollars on Nutrition books that were worthless, and spending several thousand dollars on Nutritional Supplements that were near useless, I have found THE book on how to eat right.<br />The main point that this book tries to get across is that we are not all the same internally, so we can not all eat the same diet and expect to be healthy and balanced.  While some can thrive on a vegetarian diet, others will become emaciated, weak, and sick.<br />The 65 Question Test on how to discover your Metabolic Type was the most interesting part of the book.  The questions were easy to answer.  On most of the questions, the answers were pretty obvious to me.<br />When you find your Metabolic type, there is a Q&amp;A section for each type, a section devoted to each type, and a bunch of graphs, charts, and other neat things to help you along the way.<br />This book is FAR better than others like it.  I have read &quot;Biobalancing&quot;, &quot;Eat Right For Your Type&quot;, and various other acid/alkaline, how to eat right books.  The food charts are pretty much the same in all of these books, but The Metabolic Typing Diet actually tells us WHY we need to eat this way, and really goes into depth.  The author even goes into why we should eat organic, how to go about removing toxic metals from our teeth, water, and cookware.  It's a wonderful read.  I urge anyone reading this to give this diet a shot.  It's a guarantee you will be feeling and looking better than you ever have after adopting the methods within.	2001-10-09

There are millions of people worldwide who will bash the living hell out of this book.  Why?  Because she says parasites are the basic route to all disease?  If people would do their homework before all of the bashing, they would see extremely valid points brought out by her literature.<br />I firmly believe that this book should be given to anyone who is diagnosed with any sort of cancer.  It should be automatic, just like chemotherapy is automatic these days.  This should not be the case.  We should all parasite cleanse, regardless of our conditions.<br />By following most of the guidelines in this book, we can cure many diseases we are presently suffering from, and prevent a whole bunch from ever occurring.	2001-09-20

What can I say about this book, and the Specific Carbohydrate Diet?  Can words describe how wonderful this book is for anyone suffering with the most debilitating chronic disease known to man?<br />Imagine having trouble breathing, feeling bloated, exhausted, having dark circles under your eyes, a swollen/tender liver, jaundice, severe weight loss, being a manic depressive, and having nearly every known allergy imaginable.  I've suffered with all of those symptoms, just from having Crohn's Disease.  A horrible inflammatory condition of the bowels.  Most people can't imagine how debilitating it is.  I couldn't work, couldn't keep in touch with friends, couldn't handle relationships, stress, or even doing simple tasks.  All of this from a damaged intestine?  YES.. we learn all about how this happens in this book.<br />This book will take you on a journey and teach you about a diseased intestinal tract better than I ever thought could be put into words.  The diet is easy to follow, and makes all the sense in the world.  I noticed a feeling of well-being on the first day of being on the diet.  It's a true God-send for anyone suffering from the ills of an intestinal disorder.  In fact, I think this kind of diet is what everyone in the world needs to be on.<br />What an exceptional book.. thank you to all the contributors, and the fine people who keep up the SCDiet sites!  You have changed my life for the better, and I actually feel normal for the first time since 1997.	2001-09-16

I don't know who plageurized off of who, but Dr. Bernarr says word for word what Arlin says in this book.<br />20% of the book is an \\"Interview with Stephen Arlin\\".  What kind of person has someone interview him in his own book?  You can read the interview in its entirety on (the rawfood website).   Nothing new here.<br />The remaining 5% of the book talks about how a gorilla  can bench press 5,000 lbs, how man is the only being that cooks its food,  etc, etc, etc.  Man is not a gorilla, not is he a bird, cheetah, leopard guinea pig, or dog.  To make such comparisons is ludicrous.  I do believe a diet of primarily raw foods is the healthy way to live.  <br />One more thing.. the author, Arlin, contradicts himself in more than a few ways in this book.  Example: when he describes what he eats on a daily basis, he maps out what he eats, and at what times.  He eats about 5 or 6 meals a day.  Later on in the book, he tells us that he only eats one or two huge meals at night, so he can put on weight like the sumo wreslers do.  Things like this are what make me despise this book.

I needed to break the routine up because I couldn't handle doing 3 exercises in this manner in one day.  2 exercises is more than enough to floor me.  The workout takes me no longer than 10 minutes, as long as it takes me to drive to the gym.<br />I don't know why this type of training never caught on.  I guess because people would be dropping their gym memberships in favor of buying a few pieces of home equipment.

Throughout this entire book, she finds subtle ways of telling us how bad stress, meats, bad water, and other toxic things are bad for us.  She goes into detail on virtually every one of these toxic things.<br />This book is outlined nicely, although the ideas are somewhat scatterbrained.  It's nice though, because it jumps from one idea to the next, so you don't get bored about reading the same kind of topic over and over.  It'll go from something like how Conrad Hilton overcame disease, to how fasting rejuvinates the mind, body, and soul, back to how we need to keep our 'pipes clean'.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone who values their health in any way.	2001-07-28

It is yet another book in the string of Acid/Alkaline books and the information is nothing new, but the layout, and the way Dr. Young puts it into words is extremely easy to comprehend.

It's too easy. You won't tax yourself in the least.. you'll hardly even get out of breath for very long.  This is the ideal lazy man's workout.  Anyone looking in from the outside would say, \\"Wow.. what a great workout! Only spend 30 minutes in the gym, twice a week and grow like never before!\\"  Hardly true..<br /><br />I began Static Contraction training after Steve Holman from Ironman covered it 4 years ago.  I didn't grow from the workout.. in fact, I dropped about 6 or 7 lbs of muscle in 8 weeks, even though I was eating like I was pregnant with twins.<br /><br />Even though my results were undesirable, I gave the workout another go recently.  This time was excellent!  I lost 5 lbs. of muscle in one month, while injuring myself in 3 different locations on my body!!!  Not only that, but all of my major lifts decreased by up to 15%!!!<br /><br />The authors say, \\"A pump does not indicate or stimulate growth\\". That's Mike Mentzer talking.. and he's proven himself to be the king of all idiots.  Who has ever grown enormous muscles without ever getting a pump?  Show me one person in the world, and I'll do cartwheels from New York to California.<br /><br />These guys, Sisco and Little, are pretty much Mentzer wannabees, who know nothing about building muscle, and try to sell books with ridiculous promises, using a \\"lazy man's\\" workout.  If we were all to do the amount of steroids Mike Mentzer did, we too would be enormous, regardless of the workout routines we used. Your average geneticed, Joe six-pack cannot and will not build muscle using these ridiculous methods.<br /><br />Save yourself time and money, and lost muscle, and look in the direction of proven muscle building techniques.

It gives you new opinions about bodybuilding and how to train.  These insights seem intreguing.  Why they seem so interesting is because they appeal to the lazy man inside all of us.  Unfortunately, Mentzer's view on how to gain muscle is downright foolish.  Let me explain...<br />This whole program is based on recovery, which is a good thing.  The human body is a complex machine that needs to fully heal and recover before you can regenerate new muscle tissue; no argument there.  What the program fails to offer is enough muscular stimulation to be able to achieve growth.  Mentzer makes a case for the marathon runner who often does not recover from a race for 2-4 weeks.  He then applies the same logic to one set of the bench press, as if a 30 second set of a bench press is as stressful as running a 4 hour marathon.  This comparison is ludicrous, and so is the amount of rest Mentzer requires the listener to take.<br />Initially, I was brainwashed.  Mentzer had me convinced that everything I had been doing was incorrect.  He had me believe that I would be a bodybuilder within a year or so.  I was already very well developed, but I wanted to take it to the next level.  I took 3 weeks off from training, as required, and began the program.  I lost 7 lbs. of muscle in the 3 weeks off from training.  Mentzer claims that muscle will not be lost in this time, and we will likely be stronger when we resume training.  According to him, atrophy does not kick in until the 3 week mark. Anyway, I followed the program to a T for about 5 weeks.  It was winter when I was on the program, so I couldn't judge my physique too well walking around all day with bulky clothes on.  I recall one day in the shower, after 5 weeks, looking down at my body and thinking, &quot;What the hell has happened to me?&quot;  After taking the 3 weeks off, and being on the program for 5 weeks (8 weeks total) I had lost 26 lbs. of muscle.  In that time, my bench press went from 330 to 250.<br />These results may not be typical since I'm extremely thin by nature (a Vata type according to Ayurveda--I tend to lose bodyweight very quickly).  But this program literally sabotaged my physique.  I believe in the value of recovery, but doing 1 set of bench presses every 16 days was enough to set me back a full year.<br />Note: this was 10 months ago, and I've yet to gain back what I lost in those 8 weeks.  In fact, I became so frustrated with losing the 26 lbs, that I stopped lifting entirely for awhile, and lost an additional 15 lbs.  Going from a muscular 201 to 160 can make you look like a cancer patient, and feel like one too.  Be careful with this program!  Being a hardgainer, I've had success with programs such as the Ironman Size Surge Program and Don Lemmon's &quot;Know How&quot;.e.

Ok, my title says it \\"Works Great\\", but let me tell you a little background story with me.  I bought into the concept of both Static Contraction Training and Power Factor Training. Their theories always made sense to me.  However, the workouts never worked.  I did both SCT and PFT multiple times, and never had a single result.<br /><br />Years later, I see that Pete Sisco came out with an eBook called \\"Train Smart\\".  I saw that it had updated information on these 2 training methods, so I paid the $14.95 or whatever the heck it was, and downloaded it.  In the book, it mentioned the possibility that you could be \\"Beta dominant\\" and could need 3-5 sets per exercise, rather than the 1 set per exercise they recommended in this book.  I had only ever done 1 set per exercise, and this workout never worked for me.<br /><br />I was excited at the possibility that I was in this \\"Beta\\" group, so I decided to give the workout another shot, a good 9 years after I last tried it.  I did \\"Workout A\\", and did 4 sets per exercise.  I was INTENSE.  I felt great after leaving the gym.  Wasn't sure that it would work, but I figured, ok... this seems promising.  The very next day, I got out of bed, looked down at myself, and was like, \\"WOAH!\\".  I had literally grown overnight.  No joke.  I had seen noticeable growth from 1 single workout.  A few days later, I did \\"Workout B\\".  Same thing happened.  Those bodyparts I trained (chest, back, legs) noticeably grew from one workout as well.  This just continues to go on and on and on.  I couldn't be more excited about these rapid results!<br /><br />It took Pete Sisco a number of years to work out the kinks with Power Factor Training, but it seems like if this workout didn't work for you, perhaps you should give the Beta Workout a try.  No joke, this is quite possibly the best workout program I've ever been on.  It helped me break through a 3 year long plateau, literally overnight.  THREE YEAR PLATEAU, busted through like it was nothing.<br /><br />For most people, I just don't think 1 set per exercise is enough to stimulate muscle growth.  Only people with super genetics will benefit.  For your average Joe, I think the 3-5 sets per exercise will change your mind about this workout.<br /><br />So yeah, this book is completely outdated.

A cell cannot function without proper levels of any of those three.  Often people look past a Potassium deficiency, but if you are the slightest bit deficient, your cells will misfire and you will feel sluggish and sick.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about the book was setting the record straight about salt.  We have salt manufacturers stripping salt down, removing all of the minerals, and selling us 100% sodium chloride, with no co-factors.  Then people wonder why our blood pressure goes up and we get sick, because our body treats it like a toxin or foreign invader.  Unrefined sea salt is one of the most nutritious foods we can put into our body.<br /><br />The diet is not the easiest to follow in today's fast paced society, but with proper supplementation with his suggested nutrients, we'll all see another 10-20 years tacked onto our lives.	2000-12-04

His radio program is fantastic, and he is a walking encyclopedia of information.  I am amazed at how much information he has on such a variety of topics from nutrition, to politics, to even sports.<br />With that said, let's get to the review.. I too purchased this book after seeing his show on PBS.  I had already known Gary, and had heard him talk on his radio program for years before the PBS special.  I had decided to purchase the book at the local book store upon seeing the special because it was so convincing.<br />I got home, and dove right into the book.  I was greatly disappointed at how disorganized this book is, as I am with a lot of Gary's books.  He seems to big a HUGE fan of footnotes, and posting results from various trials and protocols from peer review journals.  There is very little information in this book that actually teaches you how to Anti-Age.<br />Upon completion of the book, and getting nothing out of it, I thought I might have read it wrong, so I read it again.  To my dismay, I was incorrect.  This book is certainly not a wealth of information by any means, and you can get more out of listening to Gary's radio program for 10 minutes than you can get from reading this book from cover to cover.	2000-11-28

I purchased &quot;You'll See It When You Belive It&quot; mainly because I liked his other book so much.  I was baffled once again as I read through this book at how Dyer completely hit the nail on the head when he spoke of typical neurotic behavior.<br />I have never been more impressed with an author than I have been with Dr. Wayne W. Dyer.  He is truly a remarkable person, and should undoubtedly deserve more credit than he has gotten.  Anyone wanting to improve relationships should invest...in this book.  For the price of a McDonald's Extra Value Meal, you can totally transform your life.  You'll see it when you believe it!	2000-11-03

For anyone looking to gain 25 lbs. of pure mass, look elsewhere.  I have given this workout several go-rounds, first starting back in 1997.  My first 8 week trial was superb for strength.  I put 45 lbs. on my max bench press in that time, but did not gain a single lb. of mass.  <br />My next few attempts brought about decent strength gains once again.  My training partner put 25 lbs. on his max bench press in only 2 workouts.  It was so remarkable that a few guys in the gym came over to us and were asking all kinds of questions.  Sure enough, next time I saw them in the gym, they had a stopwatch, and the bar loaded up with plates, looking to get some of what we were getting.  <br />All in all, a great book for someone looking to burst through a sticking point with strength.  When you begin a full-rep routine again after gaining this strength, you will grow like never before.  You have to have patience though.  You will not get a pump with this workout.  You will not feel bigger, and you will not look bigger.. you WILL be getting stronger each time you go into the gym though.  I would recommend every lifter who feels stuck, try this routine to kickstart new growth.  It's worth a shot.	2000-10-15
US	49579780	R165X47XZ1WAWL	0380702894	58257522	How to Live Longer and Feel Better	Books	5	76	78	N	N	Pauling was an innovator, not a follower	Linus Pauling was a man who challenged every conclusion another scientist would reach, only to draw his own conclusions.  His conclusions on Vitamin C are backed by the gurus of the health field, namely Gary Null, Dr. Joel Wallach, etc.<br />This book is much better than his Vitamin C and the Common Cold book, which I bought first.  'How to Live Longer...' has pretty much the same exact information as his other books, but there is also valuable information about his vitamin regimen, that his other books fail to go into detail with.  For years, I have taken divided doses of C throughout the day, even as much as 10 times. Pauling likes to take 3/4 of your daily C in one shot, in the morning.  After adopting this method, I noticed a remarkable difference.<br />This book can change lives and like the title says, can help you add 15-30 years to your life, regardless of your age.	2000-10-12

Pauling jumps around from thought to thought in almost every chapter.  The information is not outdated, but too many of his references are.  So much so that it makes it unenjoyable to read.  I wouldn't advise anyone purchase this book, here in the year 2000. I would go for one of his later books.	2000-09-23

Jay Kordich, better known as &quot;The Juiceman&quot; put together a fine book here.  The information about the benefits of being a vegetarian is bar-none, as solid as it gets.  There are many great recipes for different juices.  I love the section about what each different fruit and vegetable does inside the body.  Wonderful information.  Drinking but one glass of juice yields as many phytonutrients as most American's get in a few months from food alone.  Gary Null, my idol, fully backs up the Juiceman's beliefs.  I'll take advice from a 80 year old with such vigor.  Enough vigor to do 100 pushups!	2000-09-22

Wallach is a guru himself somewhat, but definately incorporated others' views into his book.  Such as Linus Pauling's Vitamin C bowel tolerance doses, etc.  The information part of the book is great.  I refer to it often to give people advice.  It's a wonderful reference book.  Unfortunately, 7/8 of the book is an autobiography of Wallach himself.  Not a bad read, but I was a little bummed to see that much of the book was not health-related.  The most solid points that Wallach drills into our heads are mineral supplementation, and paying attention to food allergies.  It's amazing how quickly your health can turn around when you stop eating allergenic foods.  All in all, great info.  I would give 5 stars if it weren't for the long bio.	2000-09-22

Somewhere in the first Chapter of this book, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer began speaking directly to me.  What I mean, is he basically summed me up as a person throughout this entire book.  It's unbelievable how we can all adopt the same neurotic thoughts and views on certain things.  Dyer knows ALL of the things that go on inside our heads and he did a damn fine job in telling us how to change these self-deflating thoughts and actions.  This book is a must for anyone lacking self-confience, or is depressed, angry, or just not living life to the fullest.  I am a better person for reading this book.  In all honesty, reading this book was probably the best thing I have ever done for myself.	2000-09-22

I guess he likes to remain low-key.  But he has collaborated with Dr. Reisch on the best health book ever written.  If you are looking to buy a book to improve  your health, well-being, and to extend your life, this is the book!  His  facts are backed up by superior scientific research, and the book makes all  the sense in the world.  I have tried everything known to man.. even Gary  Null's programs.  The lifestyle outlined in &quot;The Calcium Factor&quot;  has brought my health from average to great in only a few weeks.  I can't  say enough great things about this book.	2000-05-29

He knows the importance of minerals in diet, knows which foods to eat, and has studied long-living cultures and received his information from others who have done extensive  research.  What I do not like about this book is the fact the entire book  is basically Wallach preaching about his supplements and his involvement in  different supplement companies.  His colloidal minerals are a very good,  important supplement but some of his recommendations are strictly because  his company happens to carry that certain product.  All in all, it's a  great book for someone with poor eating habits, and is in poor health.  For  the educated ones, you can find better material on the internet these  days.. or in Robert Barefoots book &quot;The Calcium Factor&quot;, which is  the best book I have ever read in my life.	2000-05-29
