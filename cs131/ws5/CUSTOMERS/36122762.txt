This is an excellent book on the subject. Author doesn't leap to far fetched concusions but neither is he accepting the standard explanations(bad weather, pilot error, etc). Very insightful. Its been a while since I enjoyed the book as much as this one. Highly recommended.	2005-10-03
US	36122762	R10BWPARVOCDX0	0399152431	287820315	Prince of Fire	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Very good	Interesting and exaggerating at the same time. I always like reading about Israeli's intelligence and how they operate and this book has a lot of information about that. Its very fast paced and there is not a dull moment to be had. I have to say that Gabriel's character is extremely irritating. He still feels sympathy for Palestinians and their cause, after he saw what they did to his people numerous times(suicide bombers, assassinations, etc), they kill his son and turn his wife into a vegetable and he is still feels bad if he has to kill some of these nuts?! Give me a break! Also, his devotion to his wife is ridiculous-she is a vegetable with no hope of recovery. Stronger man would have realized long time ago that his wife died a long time ago and got on with his life instead of condemning himself to lifetime of watching her blankly stare at nothing. He is portrayed as a very weak man and I can't admire that. However, other than that, this is a  very well written book. I highly recommend it.	2005-09-07

Instead of dry and monotone descriptions of the events that so often spoil military history author manages to describe battles so vividly that you can almost picture yourself being there. However, as many liberals he seemed to think that Jihad began because of the Crusades.(chapter 2, battle of Hattin). He must be reading too much Arab propaganda. I suggest he check his information-this so called \\"Holy War\\" began long before Crusades. Mohammed made it clear in Koran that \\"infidels\\"(that's everyone who is not Muslim) must be destroyed. His followers started conquest of other nations because they believe that its their duty to convert or kill everyone who doesn't follow the teachings of Koran(don't even get me started on that subject). Other that this slip-up, this is a very well written book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in military history.	2005-09-07

If we're smart(and there is no liberals in the White House) it probably won't happen in the future. However, I have to debunk this guy's theories about the end of days. <br /> <br />1) Global warming-possible in theory. Doesn't mean it will happen. They've been screaming about it hysterically for the last 20 years\\" It will happen in a few years! Be warned!\\" Nothing so far.    <br />2) Plagues-once again-anything can happen but doesn't mean that it will. Mr Moran seems to think that AIDS is the biggest crisis the world is facing. Sorry to disappoint but AIDS have started with gays, drug users and prostitutes and its still there. You don't want to get AIDS- don't have unprotected sex and don't use drugs.  Then, there is Ebola, Lassa Fever and various other horrible diseases. The solution to not getting infected with one of these nasty bugs is simple-DON'T GO TO AFRICA. Those illnesses(and many others) originated there and fortunately, they haven't been exported.  Nothing there for any civilized person to do anyway. <br />3) Ice Age-refer to answer number 1 <br />4) Weapons of mass distruction-well, author's solution, I'm sure, would be -DON'T HAVE ANY WEAPONS! Sarcasm aside, the only way to prevent some nut committing suicide with atomic bomb in his backpack is not to let him in the country in the first place. Of course,all we can do is to pray it won't happen. <br />5) Volcanic eruptions-they happen all the time and there is not much anyone can do about it. Best thing to do-don't live next to a volcano! Perhaps, poor saps living next to Mount Rainier should move-it really is a disaster waiting to happen. <br />6) Asteroid hitting Earth-a truly scary proposition but ...there is hope. According to media there is no way we can deflect or destroy an asteroid coming toward Earth. I, for one, find it hard to believe. Just like I find hard to believe that Star Wars doesn't exist. Lefties think just because there was no headline in the newspaper saying\\"Death Ray weapon built!\\" its not there. Personally, if I was the military I'd keep my mouth shut about it and shoot everyone who can't. I believe we have weapons and technology that public doesn't know about. Hopefully, that will solve an asteroid problem.  <br />The end conclusion-the only reasonable threat is from Asteroid. You can safely skip the rest of the book <br />	2005-08-31
US	36122762	R3FIRX8QGRUEPM	0515129496	536544726	Resurrection Day	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Anti war	This was a rather interesting book but it had a few points that really spoiled it for me. For example, author portrays most of US military as ashamed of what they did to Russia during the war. What does he thinks US should have done? Invite russians for tea while they nuke united states to kingdom come?  <br />Of course, he portrays JFK as a hero that tried to stop the war unstead of philandering weasel that he really was. For the life of me I can't understand why anybody would think that he was a good president let alone a hero of any kind.  <br />Then, we have the rogue general that gives the command to use nuclear weapons agaist Russia agaist JFK's orders. So predictable. Also, author thinks that Canada actually has a military(in a name only). What planet is he from?  <br />Despite all my complaints, I think this is worth a read but only if you don't pay attention to his antiwar rantings.	2005-08-31

Maybe because the main character is some kind of superhero and plot just too unrealistic for my taste. Also, contrary to what other reviwers are saying this is a pretty boring book(in my opinion). I guess you have to read and judge for yourself. <br />P.S. Of course, there is an attractive female character that helps our hero! Boring!	2005-08-25

I quite enjoyed it and it definately brought back some memories. <br />I couldn't help but feel sympathetic towards one of the reviewers who is obviously been burned by a bad marriege with a russian woman. Not every russian woman is ready to murder and sacrifice everyone for the \\"greater good\\". I think that particular viewer doesn't understand the russian mindset at all. Most russian women are much harder and much more ruthless than any american women. Lot of it has to do growing up in a enviroment that didn't allow you to be a sissy. I think for some american men this can be quite a shock. If submissive is what you are looking for DON'T MARRY RUSSIAN WOMAN! We tend to be agressive and sharp tongued(among other things). However, if you are looking for someone smart, well educated, good looking and loyal, russian woman may be for you. Good luck!	2005-08-24

Agree with cool dad reviewer-this Weston Rogers is exactly the kind of man I'd despise. Men like him are looking for a pretty sex slave who is going to stay at home having babies without a complaint. Yeah, right. For any man who wants to marry a russian woman-if you are old enough to be her father, bald and unattractive-SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU! DON'T DELUDE YOURSELF! Cool Dad nailed it right on-we want someone who threats us like ladies but that doesn't mean we want someone to order us around, thank you! <br />Weston Rogers, do yourself a favor-get your head out of your know where and see a therapist.

Nothing is explained about the guardians of the time machine until the very end and even then its vague at best. I would have love to know what the civil war in the future was about but it wasn't gonna happen in this book. Yeah, a change in weather forced everybody on eastern coast to move inland and we have a civil war? Oh, common, a little more than that ridiculous explanation was definately needed. And then, we have the killer himself-other than going on about how bad things are in the future, no details are given about what is it exactly so bad. Oh, wait, no building is heated.

I'm tired of reading about gorgeous women cops that all the fellow officers harass in some way.

Usually there is just a hint of supernatural and that's what's makes it interesting and exciting. This particular story, however, is too far fetched for my taste. Pendergast's brother is the Devil himself and has the same ability to vanish at will. That just doesn't quite cut it for me. I mean, I can understand that he could be a brilliant criminal but his escapedes go way beyond that. All in all, this is still an interesting book but I think that authors have crossed the line here-its just too unbelivable.	2005-08-06

He used to work on developing it until he realized it would be a weapon. After that he walked away from it. Oh, yeah, I could really see myself getting all sympathetic and teary eyed over it. Big bad goverment, how dare they to build a weapon to defend their country. Boo-hoo. Sarcasm aside, this is a very boring book. Story drags on and on without much excitment.

Yeah, FDA is joke, most doctors prescribe antibiotics without even considering your illness or your medical history, sort of like free candy.

I was never interested in politics until Gore/Bush election. However, I was raised in Ukraine where we call things what they are--Muslims are terrorists, Clinton is a skunk who is solely responsible for 9/11 attacks(and if you need to ask why then you need a brain implant), Saddam Hussein is a sadistic dictator who had to be taken out of play, if it wasn't for Ronald Reagan this country would be on the way to communist delusional utopia right now(I still remember from the time i was a kid, how russians were talking about \\"Star Wars\\"-with horror). Its a long list and I could go on for a while but the bottom line is that liberals here have zero understanding of foreign policy or military strategy. For example, someone hits a liberal in a face and robs him. Instead of fighting back, he starts crying and asking \\"why do hate? what did I ever do to you? I must have done something for you to treat me this was. I'm sorry, its all my fault.\\" Sounds familiar? That's the example of how liberals would act when faced with agression. Enough said. <br />P.S. For further liberal education, I recommend the Art of War.  <br />	2005-07-27

Why bother setting him up when they could have done the shootings themselves and noone would have been the wiser. I'm also tired of Jack Reacher being a hobo.

There are few things however, i found rather irritating in this book.   1)First battle described just went on and on. It could have been cut down quite a bit without losing anything. 2)This book is feminist dream come true-everyone amazingly politically correct and heaven forbid, some woman gets an apprasing glance from 1942 guys. He is immediately reprimanded by modern sailors who are the models of proffesionalism. Not to say that our navy is not proffesional but Mr Birmingham will make you believe that men will treat women like men and everyone is happy. Well, in feminist dream perhaps.   3)You will also have to put up with ships named \\"Hilary Clinton\\" and dialogue that explains to idiot newcomers that she\\"was the best president we ever had since Ronald Reagan\\"(Can I throw up now?)

Or if you love gardening, spend more time in clients gardens\\" Now, is that deep or what?  Also, author advocates to sending out cards informing everyone that you are now a real estate agent. I can tell you what everyone will do with those-use it as toilet paper. Don't waste your money on such baloney-I've been in business few years(not in sales but I had plenty of opportunity of interacting with other agents and brokers) and I can personally attest that it doesn't work. And this is just a few pieces of \\"advice\\" that you will see here.  Buy this book to learn what not to do, or better yet save your money.	2004-10-03

Instead, they made Armaggedon and Deep Impact which are entirely forgettable. Moonfall has it all-a disaster that threatens Earth, people who are trying to fix it, fruitcakes crawling out of woodwork and of course, the Moon exploding(or breaking into pieces, to be exact). Oh, if only you could see something like that on the big screen I'd be first in line. I couldn't put it down. Fantastic book!	2004-10-03

I thought this wouold be a good introductory book but this is awful. Author is beyond condecending, portraying all the Russians as bunch of ignorant oafs, intent only on drinking. All the rulers, according to him, were interested only in orgies, drinking, eating and acting like complete fools. After reading this book, readers will have to wonder how Russia became one of the superpowers of the world and why aren't Russians still living in the caves.	2004-09-16

Then we have this international conspiracy which is seriously laughable. Then, there is the martyr and the victim of every law inforcement agency-Scarpetta's niece, Lucy.

By the end of the book you don't know any more than you did in the beginning. You learn about various people and their problems but that is all.

He clearly wasn't satisfied with going on about fascist(aka Republican) goverment and just had to name concentration camp, Bucanan. Dude, are you serious? And I don't even like Patrick Buchanan but it certainly irritated the crap out of me. Why is it always right wing goverment who is oppressive and totalitarian? Since I grew up in Russia, I can perhaps give him few lessons which type of goverment is oppressive and acts like the one he described.   However, if you are willing to ignore that little piece of information, you can actually enjoy first half of the book. After that it gets pretty boring. You would think that reading about people trying to colonize another planet would be more exciting. Alas, no. About as fun as watching grass grow. Allen Steele doesn't have the ability to hold the reader's attention. A shame. I had high hopes for this book.	2004-09-14

Mr Sitchin is very convincing and no wonder-all he has to do is repeat the ancient writings. Mainstream scholars have been ignoring the evidence for years but its all there, you just have to know where to look. I never bought into Darvin's Theory of evolution  because it has more holes than a fishing net and most of it doesn't make sense, and if it doesn't make sense, itn't true. Sitchin's argument, on the other hand, makes perfect sense. I'm a believer.	2004-09-02

Books	4	9	10	N	Y	Pretty good	Can Earth be hollow? Well, the truth to be known the theory that Earth has a core is exactly that-a theory. Noone ever got down or drilled down far enough to know how things really are down there. Most people accept it as fact without knowing anything about a subject and its a shame. I grew up in a country where talking about UFOs, aliens, Atlantis and many other \\"weird\\" things didn't immediately classify you as a nut.Even scientists were open about putting forth the various theories that would make people here rolls their eyes and yet Russia produced some of the best scientists to date. The moral of the story is this-be open minded. Nothing about science is written in stone. Now, for the book-its very convincing and easy to read. One thing i didn't like -too many geological and geophysical explanations. Could have been a lot shorter and just as good. Still, i enjoyed it.	2004-08-31

I'm from Ukraine and I can attest to the fact that even high school graduates  there have better education than college graduates here. I've met people who are 30 or 40 years old and they are nearly illiterate.  60% of people I've met here either never heard of Ukraine or think its somewhere in Asia. If that's not shameful I don't know what is. <br />I'm not even going to begin to tell you what's wrong with this sexual harassment nonsense. I'm sure there are women who have been harassed but according to various feminist mouthpieces its practically every other woman. Reality check, anyone? Where does it end?

I, for one, think that majority of young women today are seriously confused about who they are-on one hand they want act like whores, on the other to be treated respectfully by men. They think they can have full time career, children and a husband who is supposed to be \\"sensitive\\" and \\"in touch with his feminine side\\". They don't seem to understand that there are choices to be made and you can't have it both ways. Personally, I want to be treated like a lady by men, I want a man to open the door for me and hold my chair in a restorant, or help me carry a heavy package. I want my husband to do the \\"manly\\" things around the house like fixing our plumbing or tuning our car. I want men to treat me like a woman because I, contrary to the feminists, am not afraid of being one.	2004-08-14

Personally, i knew it long time ago-all you have to to is read the Koran where they tell you that all the &quot;unbelivers&quot; have to be killed(that's just for starters). Funny how the democrats ignore the fact that 90% of all the terrorist attacks are commited by Muslims.

Instead we get a new character-former demolition expect and cop, who was so traumatized by the explosion three years ago that she can't exist without booze and pills. Give me a break. He goes on about this woman like she is some tough chick. R. Crais must have led a pretty sheltered life. Story itself is not bad if you don't pay attention to the struggles of the main character and don't count the number of pills she is popping.	2004-07-18

I know, I know-this sounds too stupid and improbable. However, to my surprise, I actually enjoyed most of it. Writer throws in some accurate historical facts to make it interesting, his description of what modern woman would think about Middle Ages, its customs, lack of technology, etc. is good and insightful. However, he runs out of steam towards the end and becomes somewhat boring.	2004-07-18

I `ve never aspired to be one and anyone who is makes me very irritable. Get off your man hating horse, ladies. Story is not bad but female circle thing ruins it for me completely.	2004-07-18

Huge asteroid is about to hit Earth and various nations in the world attempt to stop it. Of course, there are plenty nutcases and religious zealots who are sabotaging NASA. I guarantee, that if something like this actually happens there will be plenty of idiots like this crawling out the woodwork. Overall, I enjoyed the book but Jack McDevitt is still my favorite.	2004-07-18

But his character, Sunny Randall, P.I. was getting on my nerves through the whole thing. She is a tramp, a feminist(which means she is seriously confused about who she is or what she wants), has major head problems, and at the same time a goody two shoes. How in the god's name can you sympasize with a character like that? She is everything I despise.  Despite all that I enjoyed the book so I'm giving it high marks	2004-07-18

I stumbled upon his Elvis Cole series by accident but after reading  Indigo Slam I immediately bought the rest of his books and wasn't dissapointed. This one is definately one of the best in the bunch because it goes more in depth about Joe Pike and his past and I always liked him. He is one cool customer. I have to say that at times,  Elvis's character is a little too wussy for my taste but he is definately likeable and this novel just like most of the others is a page turner.	2004-07-14

Story itself is interesting but gets more boring as the book goes on. Patrick has too many moral issues for a tough guy(which is what he is supposed to be) and he is always hell bent on doing the right thing(yawn!). Angela can't get over her issues with her husband  who used to beat the crap out of her. Geez, get a grip already. Blah, blah, blah.	2004-07-14

Jesse Stone encounters two very smart murderers who kill randomly and seemingly without a motive. I always liked Jesse's character but his confused ex-wife gets on my nerves. It seems to be a pattern in Robert Parker's books-in his Spencer series there is Susan who just can't work through her problems and have been confused about who she is for a long time. Same here. Its my only complaint about his books which are always excellent.	2004-07-14

Its incredible what he has done for my country and how he almost singlehandedly brought it out of the dark ages. Since he has been a personal hero of mine since I was little this was very enjoyable. Book is very well written.	2004-07-08
US	36122762	R2U8V02ALYGF62	0441010466	652303425	Omega	Books	3	0	0	N	Y	ok but nothing exciting	Jack McDevitt is one of my favorite writers and that's why I was so dissapointed after I read this book. While it wasn't bad by any means it was nowhere near as good as Chindi or Deepsix or Infinity Beach. I think the problem that I had is that most of the book is taken by description by this alien civilization and how they live and act. Its rather boring and personally, I couldn't wait for something exciting to happen. I only hope his next book will be more satisfying.	2004-07-08
