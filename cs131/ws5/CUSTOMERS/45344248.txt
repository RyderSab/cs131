Three daughters, descended from the mystical King Arthur are of a marrigable age.  Their father allows them to choose their own husbands (for the most part) for love as well as politcal.

He feels responsible for the fire that took his parents' lives. He catches bits of conversation that he misinterprets and thinks the cops have found out that he killed his parents.  He runs away and becomes the equivalent of a church mouse.  This book is a heart wrenching look at what it is to be young & alone & coming to terms with your first experience of being loved, which is what you have always wanted anyway.  Buy it, love it.	2004-08-17

Where does any good daughter go when everything falls apart?  Why home to mom & dad of course.  The only problem is that her father is dying, she & her mom don't get along, and her daughter currently hates her for taking her away from everthing she knows.  The family dynmics in this book are enough to blow you away. The mother cracks part of the way through the book from all of the pressure of reliving the most tragic event of her life, all the while trying to help her daughter & herself.  I could go on & on about how fabulous this book is, but really you just need to read it to love it.	2004-08-17

I confess though, this is the first book that I have read from Beatrice Small, so that could be part of it.  Either way, this is a book with a strong & intelligent heroine that knows her mind & isn't afraid to speak it.  Despite being female in a time when that is considered unfortunate, she continues to fight for what is rightfully hers.  As the Lady of Friarsgate, she must defend her right to own her land & run it on her own, without a husband.  Good read!	2004-08-17

I enjoy a strong heroine that is willing to fight for what she cares about & what she feels is injustice to her because she is female.  Fluffy characters are just not my type & once again Beatrice Small delivers a refreshing change from the idiots that are in most romance novels.  Read for yourself & decide.	2004-08-17

Would I recommend it?  Not a chance.  Generally I like Fern Micheals, but this is a book that should never have been released.  Does she think we are all simpletons?	2004-08-16

For everyone that works in a minumum wage environment, this book will really hit home.  I don't earn minumum wage, but I'm not far off of it.  While reading this book, I was struck not so much by how hard it is to survive on so little money, but the humanity of the people featured.  This could be because most of it I experience in my day-to-day life also, who knows?  Either way I was impresed by stories behind the millions of people that we meet everyday that we never really pay attention to.  For me, that was what I walked away from the book with, and why I truely enjoyed this book so much.	2003-10-05

After reading this book, I can say with certainty that I will never pick up another one of his books.  This book starts off with a group of people coming back for their 30th reunion.  The ones that aren't lushes spend their time with various other vices (acid, men, etc...).  All I can say is that if this is middle age, I guess I've already lived the best years of my life.  Not a single character has a satisfying life.  Even the ones who have made it financially, have ... personal lives.  On a bright note, O'Brien's writing is impressive, it's just his story line that leaves ALOT to be desired.  Overall, a depressing look at middle age filled with regrets over what wasn't done and nursed gruges over decades.	2003-07-23

A hobbiest in the world of Scrabble, I picked this book up thinking I might learn a thing or two.  Boy was I impressed.  I really had no idea how intense things got.  Fastis got into the world of Scrabble while learning about it first hand.  You have wonderful glimpses into the quirks of the dedicated players who will do anything for the glory of being the highest ranked Scrabble player.  He brings snapshots of the competition and dedication of players who will receive no great monetary prizes or front headlines for their accomplishments, but who do it for the personal accomplishment.  Scrabble is a fascinating combination of math, word knowledge, startagy and the luck of the draw.  We are shown how individual players succeed and learn their personal stratagies for becoming an expert.  As Faustis himself becomes intrenched in the world of Scrabble, we witness first hand the personal drive involved with winning and the frustrations of having missed a hook, anagram, bingo, etc., Anyone interested in Scrabble or linguistics will be interested in this book.  I highly reccommend this books for anyone looking for a good read!!	2003-07-23

I had gotten out of a realtionship and was working to improve myself after learning a few things about myself that I didn't like.  This book is incredible!  It is an entertaineing, yet educational book that kept me intigued all of the way through.  I read in an earlier review how the person kept having aha's! every couple of pages.  She couldn't have expressed it any better!  It is full of insights that helped me to move closer to the person I want to be and to the relationship that I want to be in.  It pulls from Buddhism, Sufism, and Quaker ideals to help you find the ideal of a relationship you want to be in.  It has bits of poetry and scripture throughout the book that will touch you (especially the stuff by Rumi!).  A must read, and one of the best that I have ever read.	2001-07-24

Personal stories expressing the ideas presented are thrown in to help you understand what they are trying to say.  I would say that the only real problem that I had with this book is that it is definitely a beginner book.  I f you have already studied metaphysics for a little while, this book will have nothing new to offer you.  On the other hand, if you are new, this is a book that will help out and giving you stepping stone to more intense books.	2001-04-14

It covers alot of ground and will help anyone to understand.  Unfortunately, like many books of this nature, the author does end up taking potshots at Christianity.  After all of this time, aren't we getting a little better at getting past that?  There can't be a whole lot of communication between religions, ANY religion, if we are still nursing past grudges.

It is also arranged in more of a different order than most books on the subject that I've read.  It will have a chapter on a Solstice, then a chapter on sacred sites, then another chapter on a different Solstice.  Most books that I have read will have a ll of the Solstices in one chapter.
