Broadly, committed Republicans and fundamentalist Christians will hate it and seek to dismiss it as rubbish, Democrats and liberals will see it as an attempt to alert the world to what is happening before our eyes.  The five stars show where I stand.  There is too much evidence of the 'war of lies' and the people behind it for the plot to be anything but dangerously credible. The denouement of the book hits like a sledgehammer. <br /> <br />Standing back from the politics, the plot and the narrative are as gripping as his best previous work and his command of the detailed build-up of atmosphere remains quite stunning.	2005-03-25

A disappointing book from the authors of some extremely good ones. 'Deep smarts' are jargon for substantial depth of experientially based learning and reflection and the book is concerned with building and transferring this knowldge. <br />Apart from the irritation of the repetitive overuse of the jargon phrase `deep smarts' - like a sort of verbal battering-ram - the content does not add much to well-established principles for the transfer of experiential and largely tacit knowledge.  <br />The conclusions are useful, but none of them will add much for anyone in the field of organization change or development. <br />But it is also certainly true that few organizations pay enough attention to this important source of success or failure.	2005-03-06

It is crafted as a riposte to those who have seen storm waters ahead, who he refers to collectively (and unnecessarily derisively) as 'the doomsayers'. <br /> <br /> The underlying message, which is only occasionally explicit, is that anywhere that there is a problem, we can rely on the market to fix it. <br /> <br />It contains five substantive Parts plus a Section on Thinking about the Future and a Conclusion - 58 chapters in all crammed with facts and figures. The substantive parts are: <br /> <br /> *  Life, Death and Health <br /> *  Standard of Living, Productivity and Poverty <br /> *  Natural Resources <br /> *  Agriculture, Food, Land and Water <br /> *  Pollution and the Environment. <br /> <br />I think it was Samuel Smiles who proposed the mantra 'Every day, in every way, I grow better and better' and Simon and his colleagues have taken it up with a vengeance. Some of the conclusions are, of course unquestionable. Infant mortality in the developed countries has fallen dramatically, average standards of living - at least as measured by GDP - have risen, and so on. The picture is nowhere near as rosy in the Third World, but the authors choose not to focus on that, nor on the extent to which developed countries may have contributed to the problems of the third world in order to achieve the trends with which the authors are so pleased. <br /> <br />Others of their conclusions fall into the 'so what' category; chapters on alcohol consumption and the rate of murder and suicide don't really add much to either the argument or the readability of the book.  <br /> <br />Other chapters are much more tendentious and are written on the basis that 'if you can't prove absolutely that there is a problem, and that that problem directly and adversely affects humans, then its not a problem'. Their conclusions are, to say the least, surprising and there is more than a whiff of what has been rudely described as the advocate's arts of never telling an untruth but relying on suppression of the truth and suggestions that lead in a false direction (suppressio veri et suggestio falsi). For example: <br />species extinctions?: not happening, what's a species anyway and what does 'endangered' mean if anything <br /> <br />acid rain?: may actually be good for the crops <br /> <br />reserves of oil?: not a problem, never has been, never will be <br /> <br />nuclear waste?: a power station only produces a truck load of high level waste a year, in 100 years it will take 0.1 of an ounce to kill you and of course we can keep it safe. In any case, its better than coal, while solar or other renewal forms of energy are not economically viable (nothing about externalities, precious little about small matters like decommissioning, disasters touched on only for their direct cash cost) <br /> <br />ozone hole?: it may well have more to do with stratospheric temperature than with CFCs and there's no proof that it does any harm <br /> <br />The figures on which they rely would be more impressive if there were not a strong impression that they are selected to suit their case (something of which their opponents are of course also sometimes guilty). For example, dismissing the problem of pollution with a stack of figures about declining levels of pollution in US cities, there is no mention at all of the fact that part of this may be due to the wholesale export of polluting processes to other countries, such as Mexico. <br /> <br />On the basis of these, sometimes selective histories, they predict the long term future (with the saver that there may of course be short term variations). Based on Keynes' dictum that 'in the long term, we are all dead', this provides a reasonably safe platform for the contributors. <br /> <br />With a good deal of care and a bit of luck, we may prove the authors right. There is little doubt that we have the technology and the knowledge to be able to deal with the issues that face us globally - if we also have the wisdom and if we make a rapid enough start.  <br /> <br />Whether the correct approach is, as the authors would suggest, one which focuses only on the direct verifiable and short term effects on humans and which relies totally on existing market mechanisms is a much more dubious question. Where we are dealing with large scale impacts on a global system, where cause and effect may be distant in time and space, a policy of sturdy denial until every last sceptic has finally admitted to have seen the 'smoking gun' seems an unnecessarily dangerous course to pursue. <br /> <br />It requires great dedication to read the whole of the book. On the other hand, because of the breadth of its range, it is a valuable source for scenario builders and others - provided that the facts and perspectives put forward in it are checked against other sources. <br /> <br />If you do believe that 'all is for the best' and that our current system of governance is ideal, this is unquestionably the book for you. It gives you a mountain of facts, figures, trend lines and assertions with which to confound your enemy.	2005-02-24

Far too few of them engage fully with the real issues. This one does. The author has produced a definitive guide to the factors that make attention to organizational ethics an imperative in business thinking and to sound practical approaches to dealing with ethical issues. <br /> <br />In the process, she demolishes the sloppy thinking that has surrounded much of the discussion of business ethics, in particular the view that an organization is and should be an amoral entity and the related view that the only ethical duty that a corporation owes is that to maximize the wealth of its stockholders. <br /> <br />More important, she establishes clearly that ethical commitment and economic advantage are separate domains, with a degree of overlap that depends on context and timescale. The ethical dimension cannot be absorbed into the financial dimension with the cosy, but often untrue, assertion that 'ethics pays'. There is an area of activity within which ethical and economic considerations run together, but there are areas of activity where they are opposed. If one wants a simplistic assertion to support ethical behaviour, the author suggests that it should be 'ethics counts' rather than 'ethics pays'. The advantage of this formulation is that it establishes the ethical domain as existing in its own right. The author suggests that the two domains are different but complementary and need to be recognized as such. <br /> <br />What are the circumstances in which ethical behaviour and profitable behaviour are most likely to coincide? As a broad rule, the longer the time frame being considered and the more closely the corporation adheres to the standards of ethical behaviour accepted in first world countries, the more likely it is that ethical practice will coincide with profitable practice. The author discusses both the principle and some of the difficult and perplexing departures from it. There is no pretence that decision-making is easy where ethics and profitability do not run together, but there is guidance, in two chapters entitled 'A Compass for Decision Making' and 'The Center-Driven Company'.  <br /> <br />In the course of the book, there is an excellent brief history of views of the corporation and its capacity to be a moral entity and an overview of the current situation, in which the full range of theories and behaviour from high to non-existent ethics can be found, but there is a discernible trend toward recognition of the importance of ethical behaviour. This is driven by community expectations, greater access to information (and greater difficulty of concealing unethical behaviour), and slow but progressive shifts in the law, as well as by the expectations and standards of managers and employees. The move is complicated by globalization, because increasingly the large corporations are operating in countries with a wide range of cultural frameworks where issues of corruption, near-slavery conditions for workers and so on may be endemic. There is a good discussion of the temptation to adopt local standards or to hide behind the practices of an 'arm's length' contractor and some of the longer term consequences of doing so. <br /> <br />This is not a 'preaching' book. It is a cool analysis of the various ethical stances possible and of the probable consequences of each, in the context of a slow but continuing trend for the community to demand ethical behaviour. It also provides an extremely well-argued case for a stance that recognizes ethical standards as standing in their own right as a co-equal consideration with the demands of economic operation. In this sense, it is complementary to the best of the literature on the 'triple bottom line'. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-23

To over-simplify what distinguishes it from other techniques, its focus is very strongly on identifying and building on what is already being done well and on unrealized strengths, rather than on fixing what is not going well.  This does not imply avoiding recognition of what is wrong; rather the focus is on finding a way in to the necessary process of change that identifies and encourages a focus on the positive.  It also operates from a carefully articulated set of principles, which amount to a philosophy of the dynamics of organizational change. <br /> <br />The authors have been deeply involved in the development of the technique and have provided a clear and comprehensive guide to its principles, the techniques used and their applications.  The book as a whole is somewhat evangelistic, but not outrageously so. <br /> <br />The book is organized around the cycle of development and change and eight principles.  The cycle is broadly the same as that used by other techniques in the family, but is here called 'the 4-D cycle', the 4 Ds being; Discovery - appreciate what is; Dream - imagine what might be; Design - determine what should be; Destiny - create what will be. <br /> <br />The 'eight principles', taken as a whole, are more distinctive.  They are: <br /> <br />1. The Constructionist Principle.  Words create worlds and reality is a socially created construct, created through language and conversations <br />2. The Simultaneity Principle. Inquiry creates change - the moment we ask a question, we begin to create change <br />3. The Poetic Principle. What we choose to study makes a difference.  It describes and even creates the world as we know it. <br />4. The Anticipatory Principle.  Human systems move in the direction of their images of the future and the more positive the image, the more positive the present-day action. <br />5. The Positive Principle.  Momentum for large-scale change requires large amounts of positive affect and social bonding.  This momentum is best generated through positive questions that amplify the positive core. <br />6. The Wholeness Principle. Bringing all stakeholders together in large group forums stimulates creativity and builds collective capacity. <br />7. The Enactment Principle. To really make a change, we must 'be the change we wish to see'. <br />8. The Free Choice Principle. People perform better and are more committed when they have freedom to choose how and what they contribute. <br /> <br />None of these principles are unique to AI, but when taken together as explicit principles they form a powerful guide to development and management of the change process. <br /> <br />Most of the book is taken up with describing the cycle through the 4 Ds, liberally illustrated with examples.  These steps will be broadly familiar to anyone who is experienced with future search or other change processes, but some of the details and 'flavour' are interesting.  For those who are not familiar with these techniques, AI is growing in popularity as a technique, is well supported through associated web-sites and so on and is therefore a good place to start.  This book, in turn, provides excellent step-by-step guidance through the technique. <br /> <br />Whitney is also a co-author of Ludema et al. The Appreciative Inquiry Summit.  The two books are both good and are complementary, offering a usefully different emphasis to each other. <br /> <br />There is an associated website, the Appreciative Inquiry Commons, that provides a forum for exchange of ideas and experience with AI.	2005-02-23

Market clutter is real.  Too many products compete for satiated consumers, offering fine and often imagined distinctions.  The TV program The Persuaders vividly demonstrates the amount of money and effort put into a usually vain attempt to differentiate my product by persuading consumers that, if they use it and not its competitors, their entire emotional life and relationships will be transformed. <br /> <br />A book that suggests strategies for side-stepping head-on competition and reduces these complexities to six principles therefore sounds like a sure-fire winner - if it actually delivers what it claims.  Blue Ocean Strategy provides engaging packaging of sound and well-accepted strategic marketing principles, together with a clear and useful exposition of steps to success.  It is also useful in focusing attention on the big picture of identifying real gaps in the market, rather than on mere feature matching.  But the claim that this process results in \\"creating uncontested market space [which makes] the competition irrelevant\\" overstates the reality, even if this is occasionally achieved.  <br /> <br />My first reaction to seeing the book was that it would revisit the subject of Hamel & Prahalad's excellent 1994 book Competing for the Future.  Although there are similarities, the focus is in fact different. Competing for the Future is concerned with business strategy and industry definition, while Blue Ocean Strategy is concerned with the marketing strategy of a company.  The distinction is important, and allows Kim and Mauborgne to ignore important questions of wider industry and economic development that Hamel & Prahalad treat well. <br /> <br />The 'six principles' in Blue Ocean Strategy, each of which is covered in a separate chapter are: <br />1. Reconstruct market boundaries <br />2. Focus on the big picture, not the numbers <br />3. Reach beyond existing demand <br />4. Get the strategic sequence right <br />5. Overcome key organizational hurdles <br />6. Build execution into strategy <br />The detailed discussion and advice in each chapter is clearly set out and useful, even if much of it simply draws on established principles of sound business and marketing practice. <br /> <br />The authors also offer two key analytical frameworks.  The first takes the form of a chart that lists key competitive factors (price, product features, elements of appeal, etc) in a way that allows visual comparison between products as to the reliance on each element (which the authors call the 'value curve'), and also allows new appeal features to be added.  The second provides a systematic approach to analysing which features should be created, raised, reduced or eliminated in order to create a new and distinctly different value curve.  Using these tools and other subsidiary tools, the authors work through processes for reconceptualizing markets and building distinctive competitive advantage.  My impression is that the key to value of the chart is how perceptive you can be in identifying or creating the factors that you choose to monitor by means of the chart.	2005-02-23

The first has to do with leveling and then raising the playing field. Leveling involves removing the negatives of barriers, 'isms', and biases in appointment, assignment and promotion, while raising the playing field involves proactive practices to build cross-difference partnership, ensure continuous individual and team development and create systems to enable all people to do their best work (i.e. to allow for individual and cultural differences in approaches). <br /> <br />The second is based on an 'Inclusion Breakthrough Cycle', the elements of which are developed in the five chapters of Part 2 of the book. <br /> <br />The third -  Creating an Inclusion Breakthrough - is based on development of a methodology incorporating 4 phases: <br /> <br />* Building the Platform for Change <br />* Creating Momentum <br />* Making Diversity and Inclusion a Way of Life <br />* Leveraging learning and Challenging the New Status Quo <br /> <br />Each phase contains specified actions, which are detailed in the four chapters of the part. <br /> <br />None of the material is 'rocket science', but the authors do take a systemic approach to the issue and they set out a sound and useful process, which is clearly explained. It is, of course, fundamentally a particular application of wider approaches to organizational learning, focused on the specific issue of diversity.	2005-02-23

Many of the contributions - for example those that contribute to the business ethics debate - are relevant to any business that operates internationally, while some have a narrower focus - for example `Mining in conflict Zones'. <br /> <br />It is a book for reference rather than one to read as a whole.

It is reasonable to question to what extent it could operate as it does if it were a public company - and whether it could be as successful as it is.

Further, a manager 'consumes value' in the early days while he or she is getting established, before being able to 'create value'. The shorter this period is, the better for both the company and the individual. <br /> <br />The author bases his case on five core propositions and ten success strategies (these are reflected in the chapter titles. The core propositions are: <br /> <br />1. The root causes of transition failure always lie in a pernicious interaction between the situation, with its opportunities and pitfalls, and the individual, with his or her strengths and vulnerabilities. (Transition failures happen when new leaders either misunderstand the essential demands of the situation or lack the skill and flexibility to adapt to them.) <br />2. There are systematic methods that leaders can employ to both lessen the likelihood of failure and reach the break-even point faster. (Every situation is unique, but the fundamentals of appropriate strategies are common.) <br />3. The overriding goal in a transition is to build momentum by creating virtuous cycles that build credibility and by avoiding getting caught in vicious cycles that damage credibility. <br />4. Transitions are a crucible for leadership development and should be managed accordingly. (Transition acceleration skills should be taught, so that talented people do not drown unnecessarily.) <br />5. Successful adoption of a standard framework for accelerating transitions can yield big returns for organizations. (A very large number of transitions occur each year in large organizations. The scope for improved productivity and results from better attention to improved transitions is enormous.) <br /> <br />The book develops these propositions by working through the success strategies in detail. <br /> <br />While the advice is valuable and well-structured, it is rather too much of a catalogue focusing on a series of individual strategies to follow, where the situation requires a systemic approach. In consequence, I question whether it is complete. For example, there is little direct discussion of a key issue for leaders in organisations which focus on the short term bottom line: a new entrant at every level very often faces the delayed unintended consequences of a predecessor's actions designed to produce a lift 'this quarter'. These longer term consequences may be deep-seated, potentially devastating - and well hidden. It could be argued that failure to identify and deal with these in time is the major underlying cause of perceived failure of new managers.	2005-02-23

Mintzberg has a formidable reputation as an educator and writer on management.  Unlike Drucker who is a pillar of the managerial establishment, Mintzberg is an iconoclast, turning a very sceptical pen on many of the most cherished tenets of management belief.   <br /> <br />He chooses his targets carefully.  His attacks are devastating in their accuracy and detail, but he always spends more time constructing the new than destroying the old.  His solutions are notable for their common sense and the fact that they are grounded in experience of the real world, rather than in fashionable theory.  Because his targets are ones that are dear to the establishment heart (what could be closer than the value of strategic planning and of the MBA as a qualification for high business office?) his books tend to be blockbusters, bringing together a formidable amount of evidence for his case from many sources.  However, the central ideas are relatively simple and are expressed in colloquial and engaging terms, with more than a touch of humour. <br /> <br />His last major target was strategic planning, in his 1994 The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning.  This time his target is the practice of management itself and the, in his view, malign influence of management education in the form of the dominant MBA degree on managerial practice, business organizations and wider society. <br /> <br />Management education and the role of the MBA have been in Mintzberg's sights for a long time.  For example, his 1989 Mintzberg on Management contains a major section, which could be seen as a precursor to the present book, while his career has been deeply concerned with the education of managers in the widest sense, rather than simply with teaching the MBA. <br /> <br />The book has two main audiences, those in educational institutions concerned with management education and those in business concerned with the selection and development of manager.  There is also a third potential audience of thosewho are interested in their own development as managers.  Each will find the book very useful, but the second and third audiences are likely to want to skip much of the detail. <br /> <br />In terms of the impact of the book, my only question is whether Mintzberg has not left the publication a bit late.  While it is clear that the evils that he describes are widely present, there is also increasing evidence that the alternative approaches to management education that he advocates are being put into place more widely.  This is true at least in many large corporations, even if it is less evident in the major business schools.  However, even if the book might have had more impact if it had been published a few years ago, the careful analysis, detailed prescriptions - and even the somewhat dramatic presentation of these findings - ensure that the book will attract the notice that it deserves.  It is to be hoped that it also stimulates further action. <br /> <br />The book is in two parts.  Part One explores the requirements for effective practical management (including general management) and discusses the current focus of business education.  An essential preliminary is to distinguish management education (provided by educational institutions) from management development (which is derived from a whole range of processes in which practical experience in specific contexts plays a crucial role).  Throughout the book, there is careful definition and differentiation of terms to ensure that business is not confused with management or education with development. <br /> <br />Part Two is concerned with developing managers in practice, and compares various approaches to this end, their advantages and weaknesses.  From this it seeks to identify a way - or rather the principles underlying a series of compatible ways - forward. <br /> <br />The key to his argument is found in a chart which distinguishes three 'zones' of management development and education: <br />  <br />* the educating zone, the key domain of Business Schools;  <br />* the training zone, in which consultants and institutes figure prominently; and <br />* the practising zone, largely filled by corporations and the in-house academies. <br /> <br />The issue is how to combine these three perspectives on development most effectively and productively.  After two initial chapters which discusses the principles, including 8 propositions for management education, there are five chapters which are in effect an extended case study of the program with which the author is closely concerned, the International Masters in Practicing Management.  The book ends with a chapter on developing true schools of management - a title designed to distinguish these from the familiar 'business schools'.	2005-02-23

The term `predictable surprise' will undoubtedly enter the managerial and political language. <br /> <br />They have provided a valuable analysis of why these predictable disasters occur and what can be done to prevent them (while recognizing that there are also such things as `unpredictable surprises' which can not be avoided through these processes). <br /> <br />The book is invaluable for the clear way in which it brings the elements together and for the vividness and immediacy of the examples chosen to illustrate the points. The result is a book that is very readable as well as being immediately useful, even if many of the points have also been made elsewhere by other authors. The book provides a template against which organizations can assess their defences against `predictable surprises', and I suspect that every organization will find gaps in its armour when it measures itself against the recommendations in the book. <br /> <br />The authors also use the book to mount a stinging attack on the failures of the American political system (and by extension those of other countries) and the need for fundamental reform. Their attack on the activities of the special interest groups and their direct responsibility for some of the worst disasters that the US has suffered is particularly pointed. One can only hope that the criticisms will be listened to and acted upon, and that politicians as well as business people will read and note them. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, the systemic, interconnected nature of the processes that lead to predictable surprises is very clear, but the authors do not, in my opinion, highlight the fact as strongly as they should. They do point out that depletion of international fisheries is a classic case of 'the tragedy of the commons', one of several archetypalforms of systems relationship, but virtually every example that the authors cite could well be illustrated with simple systems diagrams based on one or other of the classic 'systems archetypes'. Systemic issues require systemic solutions and the leverage for systemic change may be located well beyond the area of control of the immediate actors - another fact that shows up clearly in the course of the authors' examples.  <br /> <br /> It is probably no coincidence that I was strongly reminded of Barbara Tuchman's The March of Folly as I read the book. The perspective and coverage is different, but the themes of willful ignorance, willful inaction and willful pursuit of perceived short-term self interest as fundamental drivers of future disasters are common to both. If Tuchman were still alive, I would have confidently expected an analysis of Iraq to follow her masterful analysis of the Vietnam war, the American War of Independence and the drivers of the Reformation. In its own way, Predictable Surprises provides a contemporary update of the ways in which we continue the march of folly.	2005-02-23

This book, like his earlier Leading Minds, is directed primarily to a business and general audience. I regard Leading Minds as one of the best current books on leadership and Changing Minds adds very useful insights into how to be effective in one of the key activities of a leader. <br /> <br />The core of the book is concerned with identifying the seven factors at work in changes of mind and how they are applied in situations ranging from dealing with small homogeneous groups through to dealing with large and very diverse groups. In the course of the book, he appeals to the concept of the 'schooled' and the 'unschooled' mind (a person who is vey sophisticated in some fields may judge issues outside those fields in an 'unschooled' way), which he introduced in Leading Minds. He also refers to - and updates - his now famous concept of multiple intelligences,with the advice that one is more likely to be successful in mind changing if several intelligences can be appealed to (think of the power of a song - words and music - compared with plain text). <br /> <br />The book provides a very valuable guide for those concerned with gaining acceptance for and implementing change. <br /> <br />For a somewhat different - and also very useful - perspective, it is worth comparing this book with Hultman: Making Change Irresistible. <br /> <br />Gladwell: The Tipping Point also provides a different but complementary perspective on the factors and agents in acceptance of a new idea, fashion or concept. He focuses on what it is that causes an 'infection' to move suddenly from a few isolated cases to a full-blown 'epidemic'. The book contains useful reflections on the skills and situations required for this to happen.	2005-02-23

This is one of the most important and valuable books I have read. Paul Hawken and Amory and Hunter Lovins have achieved a stunning feat. They show how the principles of a free market, plus a systemic understanding and valuing of natural and social capital, and the principles of 'lean thinking' can produce a 'natural capitalism' that will ensure ecological and social sustainability into the future, while building and spreading economic prosperity. <br /> <br /> The authors demonstrate the huge opportunities that flow from using the market mechanism as it should be used, which requires that it operate within a framework of whole systems thinking and clarity about societal and environmental goals. In doing so, they sidestep much of the sterile argument between 'free marketers', 'environmentalists' and 'social activists' by demonstrating how the best principles of each can be synthesized into a coherent system. <br /> <br /> As well as being a well-argued case for change, it is loaded with ideas and examples of radical improvements in efficiency, sustainability and profitability. The book has a series of relatively short statements of principle about the opportunities to operate in ways that are less wasteful, more environmentally friendly and better adapted to human needs. Each is followed by extended case studies to demonstrate that each principle is already in or entering the realm of practice. The examples cover transport, industry, town planning, domestic architecture and other arenas and are a treasure house of ideas for social activists and entrepreneurs alike. <br /> <br /> The book is organized to show that: <br /> <br />*  the contribution of natural capital - air, water, forests, recycling services and so on - to our health, wealth and happiness is not acknowledged by conventional economics. If its outputs were valued and the value capitalised, that value dwarfs industrial capital value and outputs. More to the point, there is no technological way, either known or on the horizon, of substituting for the services that natural capital supplies without charge. We are currently destroying or using up natural capital at an increasing rate and, in the process, producing unintended side effects that further damage natural capital in a vicious cycle. Profound changes in ways of thinking, accompanied by relatively simple changes in governance of society and commerce can redirect the market to work to build natural capital rather than destroying it. The first step is to recognize that natural capital is no longer (if it ever was) a 'free good', but is a scarce resource, to be treated as such <br />*  technologies for dramatically reducing energy use and associated pollution from fossil fuel are rapidly approaching commercialization. The fuel cell, which uses hydrogen to produce energy plus water plus nothing else is a notable example <br />*  even with existing proven technologies, the opportunities to reduce sheer waste in the use of energy are not simply incremental, but order of magnitude (the authors cite examples up to 90% of original use), essentially through taking a lateral and systemic approach to finding savings opportunities (using 'the logic of lean thinking'). The costs associated with harvesting these savings are often recovered in six months or less <br />*  a systemic approach to design is crucial. Upwards of 80% of final capital and operating cost are determined before a brick is laid. The book is full of examples of how better thinking has produced superior end results with savings of over 90% compared with 'conventional' approaches <br />*  much the same is true of human capital and, in the same way, a good deal of lateral thinking accompanied by some simple commonsense approaches to getting as much value as possible out of as little resource as possible, can produce dramatically better results both for people and the economy <br />*  for a free market to operate consistently to the benefit of society and protection of sustainability, incentives and boundaries need to be consciously designed so that market operators are rewarded for operating in ways that benefit society. (By extension, the myth of 'the invisible hand' is just that - a comfortable but seriously misleading myth). While the 'free market' and free enterprise system are powerful tools for efficiently meeting economic and often societal goals, they are far from perfect. 'For all their power and vitality, markets are only tools. They make a good servant but a bad master and a worse religion...they can't do everything, and it's a dangerous delusion to...believe they can - especially when they threaten to replace ethics or politics.' At the same time, there are enormous opportunities for achieving economic, environmental and societal goals through well-designed use of market mechanisms (for example trade in sulphur or carbon credits) <br /> <br />This stunningly good book can be read with profit in a number of ways. For example: <br />*  entrepreneurs, even those with no interest in wider issues of the economy and society, should read it simply as a treasure house of ideas and examples of ways in which a little ingenuity, some lateral thinking and, above all, a capacity to see systemic relationships can open the door to highly profitable opportunities; <br />*  managers of established and mature businesses will see major opportunities for cost reduction and profit enhancement - in ways that will also contribute to their broader corporate citizenship; <br />*  politicians and policy analysts of all persuasions will find opportunities to broaden their thinking, and to find new and better solutions to deep-seated systemic problems; <br />*  ordinary citizens will find many myths exploded and a clear rationale for action that they can take at a personal, local and national level. <br /> <br />The lesson of this book with respect to forecasting is simple and clear: No matter what future one believes in, building the principles of natural capitalism into our planning will make the foundations of society firmer. The best option for an uncertain future is the one that leaves most options open.	2005-02-23

This is very far from being a conventional time management book. It is much better than that. You will not find 'seven steps to taking control of your time' or anything like that. <br />Jacob Needleman is a highly regarded philosopher and this is a serious work of philosophy, with strong overtones of Taoist or Zen approaches. Like those, it is a practical guide, but not the sort of easy guide that is most commonly found in the management literature. <br />It is based on the distinction between the Ego and the Self and argues that our crisis of business and stress is closely related to neglect of the search for the Self. The author's practical advice is built around developing a habit of mind that gives honour to reflection and a degree of detachment. <br /> <br />There is, of course, much more in this short book than that. There are times when one wonders whether the narrative is leading anywhere, followed by flashes of recognition. It is well worth considering if you are open to philosophical and sometimes counter-intuitive guidance. Certainly, it helps to show that the approach to 'time management' of relentlessly increasing your efficiency at filling your day with more things is inevitably counter-productive, and it offers a difficult but practical alternative route to a sane outlook and a sane life.	2005-02-23

Ervin Laszlo has a formidable international reputation as a systems philosopher and the founder of general evolution theory. He has written around 70 books covering a wide variety of fields. His style is lucid, direct and very readable. This book is a brilliant addition to dialogue on an issue that desperately needs clear thinking and the ability to challenge ossified mindsets in a way that is constructive rather than merely strident. It is thoughtful, sober and constructive, in contrast to so many books in this genre that are slick and sensationalist.  <br /> <br />Laszlo makes a carefully argued case that the world is in a rapid and fundamental transition, which will become critical during the years 2001 to 2010. Whether the outcome is 'breakthrough' or 'breakdown' depends primarily on building a 'fundamental revolution of consciousness' among a critical mass of people. The three parts of the book describe  <br /> <br />the concept of a 'macroshift', historical examples of previous macroshifts and the choices before us <br />the 'new imperatives' and the logic underlying them; and <br />the way ahead.	2005-02-23

In the process he convincingly refutes the widely promoted view that American style market capitalism is the 'best' form of capitalism which should, indeed inevitably will, be established everywhere. <br /> <br />The essence of the strength of the market economy is \\"disciplined pluralism\\" and \\"output and living standards are the complex product of the economic environment intersecting with social, political, and cultural institutions.\\" In describing the co-evolution of these systems, Kay also provides a very wide-ranging overview of economic history and the development (or lack of development) of social institutions in many countries. <br /> <br />The basic ideas are not very surprising, but Kay's exploration of them produces fascinating insights - not least the enormity of the differences between the reality of why American capitalism succeeds so well in America and the economic fundamentalist mythology that is often used to justify it. <br /> <br />If you are interested in holistic, intelligible and readable economics, this is required reading.	2005-02-23

This book expands the same general theme to wider aspects of the effectiveness of organizations. <br /> <br /> The main thesis is important. It is also fairly simple and a variation on the theme of several other authors: <br /> <br /> *  humans have an ability to self-organize in small groups around shared tasks: this ability is very deep-seated, being derived from our ancient hunter-gatherer past; <br /> <br /> *  historically more recent developments have led to hierarchical arrangements for carrying out tasks and these arrangements have tended to ignore or even actively discourage the capacity for self-organization; <br /> <br /> *  with the rise of the knowledge economy and recognition of complexity theory as a better descriptor of human affairs than previous more deterministic and linear theories, self-organization is increasingly evidently a more effective means of achieving results than top-down command-and-control in many (even most) situations; <br /> <br /> *  we therefore need to find forms of organization and of leadership that support and encourage self-organization. <br /> <br /> The author suggests approaches, based on examples of organizations (particularly W.L. Gore and Associates) that use these principles successfully.  <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, variants on this general thesis are attracting attention from a number of other authors, notably Dee Hock: Birth of the Chaordic Age and Lewin and Regine: The Soul at Work. <br /> <br /> Ehin goes into substantial detail to explore the various innate drives in humans, show how they interact and explore how the tensions between different drives (such as the drive for cooperative self-organization and the drive for power) play out. My reaction is that the discussion is interesting and useful but that, if you accept the importance andvalue of self-organization - as I do - it is not necessary to follow these arguments in detail, although it is important to note the implications that the author draws out of his arguments.  <br /> <br /> The more important practical issue is \\"how do we get best use of these 'hidden assets' under different organizational circumstances and how far is the currently dominant hierarchical form of organization necessarily hostile to harnessing these 'hidden assets'?\\" <br /> <br /> This can be broken into two rather different questions which raise substantially different issues: <br /> <br /> 1.   How to build an organization from new (or from small and flexible beginnings) that makes best use of these human characteristics and capacities. <br /> <br /> 2.   How to adjust procedures and attitudes within established hierarchical organizations, such as to gain maximum benefits from self-organization. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the author does not make a clear distinction between these two situations and much of his argument is implicitly more directed to the first than the second situation. Arguably, the second situation is more important and offers the greater challenges. <br /> <br /> In this context, two of the factors influencing access to self-organization that he does discuss are style of leadership and (briefly) physical layout (For more on this interesting and important issue, see Turner: New Workspace, New Culture). Both are important as facilitators or serious inhibitors of self-organization.	2005-02-23

[But]...these 'obvious' overlaps and interactions are not yet treated generally in a holistic way.\\" <br /> <br />This quotation is from Chapter 9 'A Fuzzy Convergence', which summarises the main arguments and introduces the case studies that make up the second half of the book. All managers would benefit from reading this chapter and Chapter 16 'A management Agenda', even if they decide to leave the rest of the book for 'the experts'. However, they are also likely to find material to interest them among the case studies - for example Chapter 15 is a long and very thorough study of a health system 'UK health authorities struggle to survive'.  <br /> <br />For those with a direct responsibility for managing risk - which, after all, includes all senior managers, if not everyone with a managerial responsibility - the book is an invaluable guide to the details of risk management and what 'risk' encompasses, as well as to the cultural, technological, environmental and other linkages that make up the linked phenomena of risk and their management. As the authors point out:  <br /> <br />\\"...integration of different risk management functions, disciplines and activities remains weak or non-existent in most organizations.\\" <br /> <br />The book looks systemically at the whole process of strategic direction setting and change management from the perspective of recognising, accepting and managing risk. It is a perspective that is too often neglected, sometimes with the sorts of horrendous consequences spelled out in some of the case studies.  <br /> <br />The book is thorough, well set out and easy to reference and not too technical in its presentation. It deserves a place in every organisation.	2005-02-23

This is a book of essays on business ethics that suffers badly from the limitations of the genre - 'you write about this aspect, he'll write about that, she'll write about the other'. The result, inevitably, is a set of parts that fail to make a whole, even though some of the parts are good. It is mostly written in a folksy style with a lot of personal anecdote, which will appeal to some. <br />In general, it is long on how you ought to behave and what you ought to do, and short on serious examination of the system conditions that will encourage and reward ethical behaviour. It is also, unlike Paine's Value shift, short on recognition of ethics and economics as separate, sometimes complementary and equally important domains.	2005-02-23

Based on a detailed survey among seven large organizations across a range of private and public sector industries, this is a valuable study of the realities of contemporary labour relations. It challenges the view that deregulation of labour relations has produced a sustainable improvement in the work situation (either for employers or employees). More broadly, it challenges the view that the operation of a 'free market ' in labour relations is guided (whether by Smith's 'invisible hand' or anything else) to produce the 'greatest good for the greatest number'. <br /> <br />The analysis of the data gathered from the survey is based on a model in which employment practices are mediated by three major influences or drivers: <br />* external market and regulatory conditions <br />* organisational culture and power relations, and <br />* performance pressures <br /> <br />The book is densely argued and requires careful concentration. It should interest anyone concerned with developing or giving advice on labour relations policy and those concerned with developing 'people friendly' policies in organizations. It provides solid data to challenge many of the more comfortable assumptions about the impact of 'the new workplace' on individuals and society. At one point the authors describe current trends in terms of a move towards 'an unfair day's work for an unfair day's pay'. <br /> <br />In essence, what the authors have found is that deregulation has, not surprisingly, led to pressures which produce the effect of a race to the bottom, with results in society that bear little relation to utopian dreams that the march of progress will result in more security, more leisure and improved quality of life for all. <br /> <br />While the studies were all carried out in the North of England, some of the companies involved were multinationals and most of the findings appear broadly applicable to the Australian environment and probably to other Western societies. <br /> <br />The listof References at the end of the book amount to a comprehensive overview of the literature in this field.	2005-02-23

His concept of 'the mess', which needs to be formulated for planning ends and means, anticipated (1981) much later work based on complexity.  <br /> <br />The book consists of two parts. The first Part is on our changing concept of the world, the corporation and of planning. The second Part works through:  <br />* 'formulating the mess'; <br />* ends planning in terms of idealized design, design of management systems and organizational design; <br />* means planning, expressed as formulating and evaluating alternatives; <br />* resource planning; and <br />* implementation and control of plans and planning. <br /> <br />'Formulating the Mess' is a key concept of Ackoff's.  <br /> <br />\\"... a corporation's mess is the future implied by its and its environment's current behavior. Every system contains the seeds of its own deterioration and destruction. therefore the purpose of formulating the mess is to identify the nature of these often conceled threats and to suggest changes that can increase the corporation's ability to survive and thrive.\\" <br /> <br />Ackoff then sets out three types of study: <br /> <br />1. a detailed systems analysis of the state of the corporation and the nature of its interactions with the environment <br />2. an obstruction analysis - identification of the obstructions to corporate development <br />3 preparation of reference projections <br /> <br />These together provide a picture of the future the corporation is now in, and provide the basis for ends, means and resource planning to work towards a more sustainable future. <br /> <br />The book was years ahead of its time and describes processes that remain highly relevant and useful.

The book is written around a simple but powerful idea. Whatever their public stance, organisations are in fact run by and for the benefit of a core group. At best, this is the source of a dynamic that produces great benefits for all players. At worst, it leads to a primary purpose of extracting wealth from all other constituents for the benefit of members of the core group. <br /> <br /> As developed in the author's highly readable style, this deceptively simple idea produces extremely valuable insights into the dynamics that actually drive organisations and the great issues involved in ensuring that these organisations, the society in which they are embedded and the physical environment on which both depend live in reasonable harmony. (It is interesting that, almost in passing, the author deals a deathblow to the outdated notion of Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' on which the neo-conservatives still rest their political and economic philosophy.) <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the fact that the idea appears 'new' and yields a genuinely useful and sometimes surprising perspective on these great issues is itself a product of the evolution of organizations. If the same theory had been put forward when family businesses were dominant, it would have been too obvious to merit comment, (and each small enterprise would also have been governed, however imperfectly, by the 'invisible hand'). Kleiner has chosen to study organisations which: <br />*  have become so large that they are political entities rivalling many governments, and in which the study of power and its exercise has all the complexities of wider political theory <br />*  operate within a wider system of societal governance, but are able to treat with the wider government almost as independent sovereign powers - and are often large enough to challenge, change or ignore it to their own benefit <br />*  overtly reject (with a very few, very interesting exceptions) the notion of democracy within the organisation. Realpower (as distinct from the often purely formal power of a Board member) is obtained and exercised through processes that are seldom transparent, not always legitimate, and therefore only very imperfectly accountable. (The parallels to a medieval court are startling, and it is a bit surprising that Machiavelli is not cited in the bibliography.) <br /> <br />These are the organizations that dominate our global economy. Most of them are American, so it is valuable that that the study is by an author with an intimate knowledge of American business culture. <br /> <br /> The book explores three broad themes: <br />*  the nature, structure and dynamics of core groups <br />*  at the micro level, relations within the organisation - the 'ins', the 'outs' and the 'wannabes' and how they interact <br />*  at the macro level, the relationship between the organisation and wider society <br /> <br />Most of book is an exploration of the structure and dynamics of core groups, their virtues and defects and the consequences for success and even survival of the various strengths and pathologies encountered among them. There is an interesting 'bestiary' of core group types, such as the distinction between an 'extended core group' (attempts at moderate or radical inclusiveness) and 'Welchism' (overt pursuit of a tight-knit inner circle, hopefully a meritocracy, but often degenerating into cronyism or worse.) There is also, towards the end (Chapter 23), what could be called a guide to revolutionaries - some advice on how an outer group might work to transform - or infiltrate - a core group. <br /> <br />At the micro level it goes into detail on who makes up the core, how does a core group emerge, how does one get in, and the appropriate behaviour (in their own self-interest) of 'ins', 'outs' and 'wannabes'. <br /> <br />A sub-theme of the book, based on recognition that the vast majority of employees are and will remain 'outs', is the notion of the 'employee of mutual consent' with sage advice on what such employees can do either to remain happily with the organization or to ensure that, on parting, they take with them suitably marketable or protective wealth, skills and reputation. The central message is to reinforce the need to take an independent view of your own career. (Kleiner, whether consciously or not, focuses on what can best be called the 'managerial class'. It is interesting to compare his advice with the harsher view of the reality of present-day employment in Beynon: Managing Employment Change: The New Realities of Work, which has a somewhat stronger focus on 'blue collar' and supervisory staff). <br /> <br />At the macro level, the book touches on the the great issues of how one ensures that the interests of the core group are and remain consonant with those of society at large. Essentially this has two elements: corporate governance and the formal relationship between private organizations and government (as manifest in regulatory bodies and regulation). This is covered mainly in two short chapters, 24 on corporate governance and 26 on the body politic, but is also mentioned in chapter 19 on government agencies. <br /> <br />These are subjects of great importance - perhaps of the greatest importance, and hopefully the author will return to them. One of the really interesting questions is what it is that causes one core group to ignore or ride roughshod over these wider issues, while another embraces the issue of sustainability thoroughly, effectively - and profitably. Kleiner discusses this briefly in his chapter 25 The Cycle of Noble Purpose, and the business case for sustainability is developed in some detail in Holliday et al: Walking the Talk: The Business Case for Sustainable Development. <br /> <br />Those who want to pursue the issue of corporate governance further would do well to look at Cadbury, Adrian: Corporate Governance and Chairmanship, A Personal View. Sir Adrian Cadbury chaired the UK government review of corporate governance and his book compares European, UK and American governance requirements and traditions. One of the problems that he and Kleiner both highlight is the fact that, in the USA, the CEO is often also Chairman and Board members may be little more than a cheer squad for the Chairman/CEO. Cadbury's views on sound governance and the distinctive role of independent board members are very relevant to Kleiner's concerns on governance. <br /> <br />Similarly, any view of the relationship between organizations and government needs to reach beyond the USA, to compare the very different 'flavours' of capitalism in, say, Germany, France, Singapore, Sweden and the UK. Of them all, American capitalism is the most hostile to the role of government, a fact that is probably not unrelated to the spate of high profile scandals that have beset it. Having said that, the ideas of American authors such as Hawken: (The Ecology of Commerce. and Natural Capitalism.), Harman: (The New Business of Business.), and, more radically, Korten: (When Corporations Rule the World. and The Post-Corporate World: Life after Capitalism.) provide pointers toward a more constructive relationship.	2005-02-23

Others, who are more used to a diet of \\"how to's\\", sidebars, summaries and highlighted key points are likely to find it hard going.   <br /> <br />However, these are probably precisely the people who most need to absorb the ideas in the book.  I have a feeling that, just as the ideas in The Fifth Discipline did not really gain wide acceptance until after the companion The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook appeared, we may need some sort of Presence Fieldbook to support Presence.  That would also allow inclusion of material by other authors that seems to be highly relevant, for example Howard Gardner's concept of stories and counter-stories (set out in Leading Minds) and some of the ideas in Malcolm Gladwell's Tipping Point on what it is that makes new ideas catch on and his more recent Blink on intuition.   <br /> <br />The authors' central question is \\"How do we individually and collectively bring about useful change in circumstances where the past, and established ways of thinking, are not good guides to the future?\\"  If, as the authors believe, globalization, the exponentially growing impact of humans on the environment, and the overwhelming power and influence of a small number of global corporations have produced a situation in which accepted ways of thinking and acting are no longer appropriate, what are the appropriate ways of thinking and acting and how do we learn them, get them accepted and promote their widespread adoption?  Is this an issue only for those in 'positions of power', or can all of us make a difference? <br /> <br />The book takes the form of passages of narrative interspersed with conversations in symposium form.  The result is a discursive, but valuable, journey into identifying the right questions and approaches to achieving sustainable answers.  The subject is overwhelmingly important and the way it is treated is useful and illuminating.  Much of its appeal derives from the fact that the four authors are skilled in the art of dialogue and wide-ranging conversation and have complementary skills and experiences. <br /> <br />Many of the conversations build on themes that have been attracting growing attention.  The themes can be grouped broadly as:  <br />*  those concerned with identifying the issues, why they are matters of concern and what it is about current thinking and approaches to solving them that makes them worse rather than better.  These centre on impacts on the environment and the disparities of wealth around the world and the limitations of the analytical and linear approach to problem identification and solutions; <br />*  those concerned with the implications of systemicity and complexity, in particular the need to perceive the whole rather than focusing on parts.  These elements of the conversations draw extensively on insights of the economist W. Brian Lewis, and broader aspects of complexity theory; and <br />*  those concerned with holistic ways of perceiving, reflecting on and responding to issues and the conditions necessary for emergence among an empowered group of a radical new understanding of an issue, and shared enthusiasm for concerted action.  These themes draw heavily on Eastern philosophies, on systems theory and our growing experience of deliberate use of dialogue, reflection and democratic forms of group process and networking. <br /> <br />The authors build up a picture of an idea - a way of 'seeing the world anew' and a process that will help individuals and groups to move through the profound shifts in ways of thinking and communicating needed to move forward.  This is expressed in the theory of the \\"U Movement\\", the development and exposition of which forms the central organizing principlefor the book, particularly Parts 2 through 4.  The elements of the theory are most concisely shown in a chart on page 225.  It is a process in three stages.   <br /> <br />The first stage, Sensing, is concerned with standing back from our accustomed way of seeing and dealing with issues, through processes of profound reflection and a focus on the whole.   <br /> <br />The second (Presencing) is identified as the most difficult both to explain and to experience: it is (at least in part) a profound transformation from the deeply inbuilt Western view of the self as operator on an external world to an understanding of our role as one agent in the emergence of an unfolding future.  Chapter 7 contains a number of examples and anecdotes to try to convey the feeling of this transformation: it is not surprising that the printed word is not wholly successful in conveying something which really has to be experienced. <br /> <br />The third (Realizing) is based on the thesis that it is the profound (collective) change in stage 2 that results in shared clarity as to how to move forward through three sub-stages towards full implementation. <br /> <br />The argument of the book as a whole asserts that total reliance on dispassionate analytical rationalism is a sure path to the wrong answer and that we (individually and collectively) need to find ways to see the wholeness of life and to use our hearts and our intuition to become \\"part of a future that is seeking to unfold\\".  The authors contrive to bring together a good deal of evidence that such a transformation has valuable practical consequences as well as providing for a much more satisfying personal life for those who can make the transformation. <br /> <br />While this world view is still radical, at least in business circles, it is not new but is rather a part of a growing movement.  The authors take a valuable further step both in explaining why a change is necessary and in sketching an approach to learning the profound transformations in perspective that are needed.	2005-02-23

Further, these gains are often available very inexpensively and have the potential to yield large increases in profitability as well as in useful outcomes. The report gives examples and then goes on to discuss how to bring about useful change. <br /> <br />A major theme is that the conventional wisdom of both engineering and economics currently work against achieving material and energy productivity, but do not need to do so. There is an underlying theme of the need to change economic incentives and measures within the market system, which goes back at least to Hawken's 1993 The Ecology of Commerce. <br /> <br />The thrust of the book is to demonstrate: <br /> <br />* that, for historical and other reasons the capitalist world is extremely wasteful of resources, particularly materials, energy and transport (effectively another manifestation of energy use), despite the fact that technologies and good examples exist which can lead to dramatic reductions. <br />* that the failure to take these improvements up is not that they are too costly - in many cases introducing the improvements reduces capital costs - but <br />       - a failure to design or operate systemically, <br />       - the slow accretion in accepted practice (such as car design and manufacture) of 'bells and whistles' that increase weight and energy use but not performance; <br />       - a fixation on reducing labour content at the expense (typically) of increased energy and material consumption through the system; and <br />       - perverse incentives that are built into the economic calculus of business and economic success (including for example externalities). <br />* that the market is neither a god nor a devil. It is a tool that produces different results according to the guidelines and measures within which it operates. The current guidelines and measures were developed in an era when the natural environment was considered as an inexhaustible 'free good' and need to be changed; and <br />* that transition to a sustainable world is possible on reasonable assumptions if we all get serious about making use of resource saving technologies and measure our progress in more appropriate ways. <br /> <br />The many examples in Part 1 provide a useful source of ideas for improving economic performance while simultaneously benefiting the environment. The remaining three parts summarize and add to proposals for reconciling corporate, economic and ecological sustainability. Note that, while it is fairly comprehensive in its scope, there are some opportunity areas that it does not explore, such as the scope for 'ecological industrial parks' in which industries are clustered such that the waste of one is economic input for another. <br /> <br />The 'sustainability' literature is often accused of being moralistic and lacking in commercial realism. This book, like The Ecology of Commerce, Natural Capitalism, The Natural Step Story and others offers realistic and practical ways of overcoming waste and using innovative engineering and materials to produce superior value with reduced environmental impact.	2005-02-23

However, there is an excellent 'quick access guide' immediately before the first chapter. <br /> <br />On taking the plunge, its good qualities rapidly become apparent. Anyone with an interest in planning, including senior managers, should at least read the Quick Access Guide and the first Chapter, Foundations. Many will be tempted to move forward, partly by the exceptionally useful diagrams which brilliantly illustrate the authors' underlying frameworks for planning. Planning specialists will find the whole book a valuable reference and guide to process. <br /> <br />There are innumerable books about business planning, most of which are concerned with short and long run profitability and competitive positioning as a major objective. There are far fewer that address the universals of strategic choice, whether the objective is to build a business, develop a community or plan a town precinct. This is one of the few books on strategic planning that really fit public sector organisations without heavy 'translation'. It is in fact an excellent description of sound processes for policy creation. At the same time, it is also valuable in providing useful conceptual and process rigour in support of conventional private sector strategic planning. <br /> <br />It is, above all, a guide to strategic thinking and interaction, seen as a continuous process of making choices in an understanding of the connectedness of issues and the dynamic nature of the environment. In style it is reminiscent of Weisbord, Marvin R, et al. Discovering Common Ground: How future search conferences bring people together. and Weisbord, Marvin R and Janoff, Future Search on future search, with their emphasis on extensive use of working drawings in the text and a process that depends heavily on open interaction. <br /> <br />In many ways it is complementary to the literature of future search. Future search tends to concentrate on the human dynamics involved in gaining consent, with less attention given to the, often very complex, underlying analysis that is needed to identify solutions that will work in practice. Planning under Pressure, on the other hand, has a sharp focus on a set of processes for arriving at sound decisions through time in conditions of complexity. It does not give much overt attention to who should take part (other than that the processes should be participative) or how to encourage the human process of working through our hopes, fears and mental models to arrive at decisions which people can embrace, although it does emphasize four important shifts from 'classical' planning: <br /> <br />*  from routine procedures towards a continuous learning process <br />*  from expert techniques towards open technology with a focus on decisions <br />*  from individual working to interactive participation across all 'boundaries' <br />*  from 'problem solving' to incremental progress towards strategic products <br /> <br />The underlying theme is the continuing need to make strategic choices through 'creative management of multiple uncertainties'.  <br /> <br />The authors work through four modes of operation that are fundamental to the process: <br /> <br />*  shaping mode is concerned with structuring a complex problem in terms of a set of decision areas, some of which are connected through decision links (this process is similar to the Ackoff, Russell L. Creating the Corporate Future: Plan or be Planned for concept of 'formulating the mess') <br />*  in designing mode a set of decision options is identified for each decision area and feasible decision schemes are developed <br />*  in comparing mode, comparison areas are formulated and relative assessments made <br />*  in choosing mode uncertainties are developed and explored and a 'commitment package' is developed <br /> <br />These 'modes' are not used in a rigid cycle, but flexibly and iteratively. Skills in each mode are addressed in depth in a chapter of its own (Chapters 5-8) <br /> <br /> The remaining chapters are addressed primarily to those who will be responsible for managing the process, being concerned with 'Practicalities', the use of electronic tools to support the process and extensions of the techniques to policy work, project management and developing common ground. (It is unfortunate that the second edition has not made any reference to Weisbord's work, which is highly complementary to this.) <br /> <br /> It is also unfortunate that there is not more reference to systems dynamics, particularly to 'soft systems' technologies. This too is a complementary body of theory and practice. In many situations its use would add richness and robustness to the four 'modes of working', particularly through its capacity to highlight delay and the impact of unintended consequences. <br /> <br /> Planning under Pressure offers a useful analytical alternative to 'classical' strategic planning approaches; it offers an invaluable analytical tool for all forms of planning such as policy planning that are not business based; and it provides a complementary body of analytical tools to support participative approaches to developing preferred futures and community building activities.	2005-02-23

One of Rudyard Kipling's famous \\"Just So Stories\\" was about the Elephant's Child, an animal \\"filled with 'satiable curtiosity\\". Malcolm Gladwell is clearly something of an Elephant's Child himself and his curiosity leads him into exploration of an extraordinary range of interesting and useful phenomena. <br />His \\"The Tipping Point\\" was a tour de force on how epidemics, ideas and fashions propagate and what causes the sudden take-off that is characteristic of an epidemic - or a fad. From his findings, he drew out many conclusions that are directly useful to business, as well as being interesting in themselves. <br />\\"Blink\\" is that rare thing - a second book that is as good as the first. It looks at several related phenomena, particularly:  <br />* the power of first impressions and what we call intuition, why they are often right and what are the factors that can cause them to be systematically wrong; and <br /> * the related power of understanding the use of what he calls 'thin slices' (a limited number of very specific elements that are always present in complex situations or judgments) to improve judgment. <br />The book provides a systematic, fascinating and highly entertaining examination of these phenomena - how they manifest themselves, why they work as they do, why some people are much better than others at making sound judgments from apparently little evidence, what can be done to improve first impression judgments and, perhaps even more important, avoid being led astray by first impressions. It also demonstrates the extraordinary amount of detailed work that is necessary to identify consciously the tiny clues that our subconscious registers, so that they can be turned into useful tools for improving rapid judgment, and helps one to glimpse the awe-inspiring capacity for subtlety of the human brain. <br />One of the key messages for business is the power of our unconscious biases and how important it is to recognize that they exist and to take steps to minimize their impact. <br />A second key message of the book is the obverse of that: learn to trust your intuition and to cultivate it. Our subconscious is often better at detecting dissonance than are our analytical skills. <br />A third is that, out of the flood of data available by which we might judge a situation, only a few factors are truly influential (Pareto's Law applies here too). Effort put into identifying those factors and then learning to use them can bring great rewards. <br />Gladwell has in full measure the rare gift of helping readers to learn a great deal while enjoying themselves thoroughly.	2005-02-23

The author takes a narrow view of how an individual firm can improve its competitive position by 'playing the environmental card'. Although he cites von Weiscker et al: Factor Four, he does not seem to be aware of the literature that takes a much more systemic view of how to reconcile ecological sustainability, economic efficiency and commercial success. The book is perhaps useful in that it vividly demonstrates the limitations of a perspective that is centered on the individual corporation and its immediate competitive advantage with a rather blinkered view both of the scope for innovation and the wider macroeconomic framework within which business operates.	2005-02-23

This book is a very thorough scholarly work on organizational ethics that also contains practical advice for the manager. The specific question addressed is whether and in what way organizational ethical responsibilities extend beyond stockholders to other stakeholders. <br /> <br />The first and last chapters provide an overview of the issues and the implications for a practical manager: the other chapters provide thorough coverage of the range of alternative theories offered as to the ethical duty of an organization and the detailed arguments for the author's stakeholder theory. <br /> <br />The author's practical conclusions are that: <br /> * The obligations to all stakeholders are fairness based and that the corporation, being recognized as a separate entity and capable of bearing legal obligations is also capable of bearing moral obligations; <br /> * At minimum, stakeholders are those groups from whom the organization has voluntarily accepted benefits. On this definition stakeholders include financiers, employees, customers, suppliers and local communities. The author describes these as normative stakeholders and distinguishes them from derivative stakeholders, groups such as interest groups, the media and competitors who have an ability to exert influence over the organization but to whom it owes no moral obligation. He argues (perhaps controversially, as it is difficult to argue that any organization does not 'voluntarily accept benefits' from the environment) that the natural environment is not a stakeholder, but that normative stakeholders may care deeply about it, thereby making it managerially legitimate to include it; <br /> * In answer to the question 'what do stakeholders want?', he argues that many stakeholders want some voice in organizational decision making, and should have it. Their desires can not be assumed but must be identified, which implies an obligation for open communication (without specifying any particular structures for doing so); <br /> * The issue of priority, particularly as between normative stakeholders is a somewhat intractable issue with no clear quantitative guidelines, other than an aim at equity (rather than necessarily equality; <br /> * The theory dismisses the idea that the ethical obligations of business are lower than those of persons and argues the exact reverse, that the nature of organizations is such that obligations are added, being to a wider range of stakeholders.	2005-02-23

This is the best such anthology I have seen, with an excellent introduction which deserves very careful reading. To quote an early paragraph:  <br /> <br />\\"To do things differently, we must learn to see things differently. Seeing differently means learning to question the conceptual lenses through which we view and frame the world, our businesses, our core competencies, our competitive advantage, and our business models... If there is anything actually coming into focus today, it is the realization that we need to question much of what we think we know about how to conduct commerce, including marketing, distribution, service and the notion of competition itself. Hardest of all, we need to be able to think about changing the architecture of our revenue streams, that is, the way we make money.\\" <br /> <br />Also in the introduction, the author/editor introduces a powerful framework for thinking about innovation opportunities, which he calls QTL4, or Quality through Linking to the world; Listening through those linkages; Learning and reflecting through those listenings; and then Leading. He has applied this framework to selection of the articles for the book.  <br /> <br />The opening article is W. Brian Arthur's Increasing Returns and the New World of Business. It challenges one of the most fundamental tenets of classical economics, 'the assumption of diminishing returns: products or companies that get ahead in a market eventually run into limitations, so that a predictable equilibrium of prices and market shares is reached'. He argues that while this still applies in large measure to the bulk-processing economy, increasing returns, 'the tendency for that which is ahead to get further ahead, for that which loses advantage to lose further advantage' tends to reign in the newer part of the economy, the knowledge-based industries.  <br /> <br />This has enormous implications for business practice and for national policy. The two worlds of bulk processing and knowledge have different economics, operating side by side. The article works through the implications of operating in the different economies and for those organisations that have to operate simultaneously in both. It is hugely important that not only business people but also politicians and national policy makers understand its implications.	2005-02-23

This is a valuable successor to Capra's earlier books, all of which seek to discuss matters of critical societal and ecological concern within the framework of scientific analysis and understanding. <br /> <br />The book is in two parts. The first three chapters provide a brilliant summary of current thinking about the nature of life, mind and consciousness, and social reality as an emergent property of social organization seen as a complex adaptive system. It's very good but not easy to read. The remaining four chapters and epilogue can be read separately, although they rely on the theories in the first part. They form a wide-ranging critique of the current governance of organisations and of globalisation, with what amounts to a very detailed case study of how these structures produce the fundamentally dishonest and very dangerous commercial drive to GM foods. The final chapter offers broad guidelines for reshaping the current political and economic framework to bring economic incentives into harmony with the needs of society and the natural world.	2005-02-23

She is also very well-known as a speaker and is one of the select group of people who has driven forward our understanding of ourselves, our organizations and our society as complex adaptive systems. With her holistic view of the world, she is very sensitive to the connections or failures of connection that have such an impact on society and the lives of individuals. This book has as its primary focus the disconnection between the deepest needs and aspirations of humans and acceptance of the single-minded pursuit of profit as the sole imperative on business other than staying within the law. <br /> <br /> She argues that maintenance of this disconnect is ultimately unsustainable both for society and for business. She sets out to show why, and how it is possible to move toward sustainability by accepting the creation of 'spiritual capital' as a parallel goal with building material capital. <br /> <br /> The basic concepts on which the book rests include: <br /> <br />People, society and business form a system made up of interconnected sub-systems. For such a system to be sustainable requires that the elements cooperate in producing a balanced environment that nourishes the whole. They are holistic ... self-organizing, and exploratory. <br /> <br />Sustainable capitalism and a sustainable society depend on recognition and nurture of higher motivations: <br />* We need a sense of meaning and values and a sense of fundamental purpose (spiritual intelligence) in order to build the wealth that these can generate (spiritual capital). <br />* People, organizations and cultures that have spiritual capital will be more sustainable because they will have developed qualities that include wider, values-based vision, global concern and compassion, long-term thinking, spontaneity (and hence flexibility), an ability to act from their own deepest convictions, an ability to thrive on diversity,and an ability to learn from and make positive use of adversity. <br /> <br />She identifies three forms of wealth and three kinds of associated intelligence: <br /> <br /> *  Material capital, associated with thinking and rational intelligence, the wealth expressed in money; <br /> <br /> *  Social capital, associated with feeling and emotional intelligence, the wealth that makes our communities and organizations function effectively for the common good; <br /> <br /> *  Spiritual capital, associated with being and spiritual intelligence, the wealth contained in our shared meanings, values and ultimate purposes. <br /> <br />Much of the book is concerned with identifying the states of being in which a person or an organization can find itself and the principles required for transformation to a state in which higher values can be met and higher needs satisfied and the system remains sustainable. The principles are based on observation of the behavior of (non-human) complex adaptive systems plus principles for human sustainability taken from spiritual thought through the ages. <br /> <br />The qualities that the author identifies as central to a sustainable organization will be familiar to most readers - self aware, vision and value led, holistic, celebrating diversity and similar qualities. She argues that these are the qualities necessary to maintain a system in the dynamic but self-sustaining state we describe as a complex adaptive system - neither stuck in steady-state inflexibility nor falling over the edge into chaos.  <br /> <br />Maintenance of this state requires particular behaviors on the part of enough individuals acting as leaders to induce the organization as a whole to behave in that way. Her belief is that, in spite of the system pressures (such as those from the financial markets) to behave otherwise, a sufficient minority of aware people can bring about the necessary changes.	2005-02-23

It does catalogue in great detail the range of threats to human society, as well as the failings of the current world order, and advance the thesis that a series of trends are converging towards a major 'crunch' about 2030. However, much of the book is devoted to pointing out that the resources, the technology and the expertise are available to manage most if not all of these issues if only we could get our priorities right. The author, who is a former Senator in the Australian Parliament, puts forward two axioms against which he tests proposals for managing towards a sustainable world. <br />The 26 chapters cover an enormous range of issues, centering on six drivers that the author identifies, but covering health and education, the family, religion, money and other subjects as well. This provides valuable breadth and understanding of interconnections, but at some expense in terms of depth of analysis of particular issues. <br />Most of the issues that the author addresses are also covered by many other authors. The value of this book is that it is relatively short, presents the issues clearly, and offers directions which, even if not 'the answer', provide a useful starting point for dialogue and development.	2005-02-23

Goes well beyond current ideas of manageable risks to suggest concepts and tools for management of six categories of international, national and societal/personal risk that can and should be managed. The author also includes reflections on the nature of innovation in financial markets. The central theme is that current technology and databases permit the establishment of forms of risk management that would transform the our ability to achieve long term societal goals.<br />Separate chapters cover each of the six categories. They include:<BR>* insurance for livelihoods and home values;<BR>* income linked loans designed to cover individuals against hardship or bankruptcy<BR>*insurance against increasing income inequality (between nations, groups or generations)<br />Although the book is written for a general audience, some of the concepts are quite difficult to grasp. An early chapter, which provides an 'alternative history' of the period from 1950 to 2000 if the risk management mechanisms had been in place, helps non-specialists to get a feel for what the author is proposing.	2003-11-03

It is both entertaining and thought-provoking, but not in the same class as Eileen Shapiro, The Seven Deadly Sins of Business.<br />The theme is that too many businesses have taken their eye off the ball. The critical requirement for success is looking after productivity. Successive chapters look at how corporate accounts conceal what is happening to this fundamental and how resources are wasted in 'incentivized packages', advertising, IT, greenwashing and so on.<br />As is true of all this genre, the author has a case, but oversimplifies it for dramatic effect. But most businesses would benefit from reflecting whether they are committing any of these sins.	2003-11-03

It provides breadth rather than depth of coverage and is set out as a series of issues which require attention rather than providing an understanding of the processes needed to bring about systemic and continuing change.<br />The 16 chapters are arranged in three parts: Opening Hearts and Minds; Growing Competitive Advantage; Ensuring Lasting Success. Each chapter gives an overview of an issue area (e.g. recruitment and retention, managing intellectual property) and summarizes key actions needed to bring about success in that area. The presentation of each area is direct and straightforward, and illustrated with useful examples.<br />To use a cooking metaphor, it is nearer to a list of ingredients and how to prepare each, than a full recipe for organizational success. Selecting the ingredients and handling each well is necessary, but not sufficient to produce a delicious end-product. This is in contrast to Sydänmaanlakka: An Intelligent Organization, which takes the opposite approach of focusing strongly on the recipe, while treating the preparation of some of the ingredients rather more impressionistically.	2003-11-03

The author argues that business has become obsessed with risk and self-regulates to the point that genuine (and risky) innovation is stifled. He offers a lot of evidence that undue concern with risk, coupled with a desire (largely for safety) to 'offer customers what they want' and 'build customer loyalty' actually works against the best interest of customers and the business.<br />While it is clear that the author is against undue caution, he believes that this is affecting most business and makes a good case for his arguments, it is less clear what he is for. There is a risk (!) that the book will simply be used by those who are interested in preventing government regulation and ridiculing self-regulation. It is usefully provocative but ignores or ridicules some real risks that require careful management. The author's cavalier dismissal of environmental concerns is a good example of this.	2003-11-03

An Intelligent Organization: Integrating Performance, Competence and Knowledge Management.<br />The author was Director of Human Resources at the Finnish company Nokia. What the book adds to the literature on organizational learning is the detailed integration, in every aspect of operation, between development of the individual, the work group or team and the organization as a whole. He insists that ensuring that organizational learning takes place at a greater rate than external change is an holistic endeavour. For success, all aspects must be addressed together in a coherent way,<br />Virtually all of the separate principles, tools and techniques set out in the book are accessible from other sources, but the author explains clearly, with the help of good charts and diagrams, how these all fit together. The Introduction and first Chapter provide a particularly good overview of the issues.<br />The author seeks to provide an integrated answer to the key questions of:<br />    * how to improve an organization's capacity to learn<BR>    * how to improve organization competence and individual and team performance<BR>    * how to integrate the efficiency, the renewal and the well-being of the organization.<br />His solution is based on personal experience plus an overview of the literature of organizational learning. The book is largely concerned with three elements of:<br />    * performance management, which he relates to the individual and identifies as bringing together clarity of direction with management both for current results and continuous learning;<BR>    * knowledge management which he identifies with team learning; and<BR>    * competence management, which he identifies with strategic management of the organization as a whole.<br />The careful strategic integration of these three elements produces what he calls the intelligent organization, defined as one that is capable of continuous renewal, of anticipating changes and of learning fast. Its capacity to learn fast is in turn based on its capacity to develop, understand and effectively apply knowledge.<br />The book also serves as an excellent introduction for those who are new to the ideas of the learning organization/organizational learning, because it provides an excellent framework within which to fit the many elements that make up effective organizational learning. It also provides useful references to many of the main authors in the field.	2003-11-03

In response, there is a large literature on different aspects of how to communicate.<BR>Graham Andrewartha has written a very useful addition to this literature. It is written as a nontechnical guide to help individuals and, above all, working groups to understand their own communication behaviors and to observe, value and adjust to the behaviors of others. The thesis of the book is that this process of building awareness of your own style, and observing and matching your style to that of others (without seeking to abdicate your own) provides major benefits for the individual, the working group and, as a result, the organization.<BR>Like all such guides, the book can be used by itself and by a single individual. With persistence, an individual can obtain value in this way, and the book contains a wealth of good examples and exercises to assist in the process. However, the greatest benefit derives from a working group using the material in a planned way, guided by a skilled mentor and facilitator, who can also make connections to related factors such as the influence of personal values on communication and response. The book is clearly derived from the experience of the author in this role.<BR>The book is in three parts. The first introduces the issues, identifies the benefits of better communication, and explores the factors that contribute to good (and bad) communication. Particular attention is paid to the importance of clarifying your own purpose, observing and understanding the style of the other(s) and matching not only the message content but your voice tone and body language to their style and expectations. Towards the end of Part 1 the author introduces 'seven evolutionary patterns', each of which is a continuum between alternate styles of observable behavior which derive from ourevolutionary experience.<BR>Part 2 goes into the detail of these seven observable patterns of preference. They are:<BR>* Timing: from 'rapid' to 'gradual'<BR>* Emphasis: a tendency to exaggerate or understate<BR>* Thinking: linear or lateral<BR>* Focus: concept or detail<BR>* Evaluation: self-evaluator or other -evaluator<BR>* Relationship: initiator or responder<BR>* Perceptual system: visual, auditory or experiential.<BR>For each dimension the book offers a simple self-diagnosis tool, followed by a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each extreme, stories and case studies of the interaction between extremes, and exercises. The exercises are designed to improve understanding and the reader's ability to operate effectively with those with a preference elsewhere on each continuum. Note that the self-diagnosis questions in the book are indicative but not statistically validated. Readers can complete a validated questionnaire and receive (for a modest fee) a detailed report on their own style by going to the author's site.<BR>From these seven dimensions, the book also identifies a preferred leadership style (in Part 3) and provides an overview of the observable characteristics of each, and its strengths and weaknesses.<BR>There are many systems, and even more books, devoted to the same end of improving ability to work with difference and personal and team effectiveness. They are mostly complementary, offering somewhat different perspectives on the same phenomenon and somewhat different roads to improvement.<BR>For example, the author's system, which is concerned directly with observable behavior preferences, differs from the well-known MBTI system based on Jungian personality traits, but there are recognizable similarities between the two. Both are complementary with and overlap to some extent with the Belbin approach to team role preferences and to working in groups.<BR>Similarly, all these systems for understanding and working with preference combine well with deliberate use of the tools for selecting between styles of conversation and managing skilled conversation - see for example Senge et al: &quot;The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook&quot; (sections on mental models and team learning) and Isaacs. W.: &quot;Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together&quot;.<BR>Consistently good communication between individuals and within and between groups is both rare and, when achieved, provides an extremely powerful road to personal and organizational success. &quot;be understood or be overlooked&quot; is a valuable addition to the guides to better communication, with the particular advantage that it is written in simple and direct language around situations that are directly experienced.	2003-10-30

She is at the centre of a world-wide network of KM specialists. This book is part grand vision, part synthesis of the various strands of KM, part guide to practice, and part guide to the literature and celebration of some 'great names' in the field.<br />As a grand vision it risks utopianism by ignoring some realities and paradoxes that do not fit with the vision. The synthesis is useful, particularly in its insistence on a holistic view of the technology and human aspects of KM, although specialists in other disciplines may not welcome the attempt to subsume the whole of strategy and management under the KM umbrella. <br />Those seeking a guide to practice will find some very useful tools, perspectives and approaches, but may be frustrated by the very conceptual level at which many are pitched.	2003-10-05

Lindsey is a neo-conservative and this book represents a wide-ranging but finally unsatisfactory addition to the non-debate about globalisation. It divides the world into two groups - the free marketers, who are good, and the collectivists, who are anti-modern and the cause of most if not all the failings of the current highly imperfect free markets. Anyone who can lump George Soros' concept of the Open Society with collectivism, really has a bad dose of the current tendency to declare 'if you are not with us, you are against us'.<br />Read the book for a sometimes fascinating excursion into history, politics, the informal economy, the failings of collectivism and state control (but not the failings of the market), but do not expect to have much light cast on the underlying issues of wealth and poverty, sustainability and the proper place of money in judging the progress of society. Equally, do not expect to see useful engagement with the issue of the role of great international economic agencies (WTO, IMF, World Bank) and the processes by which nations, corporates and the common people influence their decisions.	2003-10-05

What will become of humanity and its successors this century, over the current millennium and in the distant future (say 100,000 years or so)? Are we headed for extinction or is 'quality survival' possible or even likely? Are the prospects for quality survival something that we can influence and, if so, what are the priority issues on which to maintain a continuing focus in order to optimize our prospects?<br />Doug Cocks engages with these questions with obvious enthusiasm. His exploration is immensely wide-ranging and he brings together an extraordinary range of fact, theory and speculation in a way that is scholarly while remaining colloquial, and which carries the reader on a truly fascinating journey through - to quote one of the author's allegories - a series of dungeons in which Posterity finds herself having to slay a series of dragons, maturing and growing stronger as she succeeds in overcoming each more formidable dragon. Cocks' conclusions, at least about the possibility of long term quality survival, are modestly optimistic.<br />He uses a methodology that contains elements of scenario building and preferred futuring to explore these questions, basing his enquiry around four priority issues. The issues are:<BR>*  Nursing the world through endless change<BR>*  Raising the quality of social learning<BR>*  Confronting near-future threats and challenges<BR>*  Anticipating deep-future challenges.<br />These issues are selected as representative of the need to respond &quot;collectively and selectively to an ever-changing set of priority issues, meaning those judged at the time to have a particular bearing on whether the lineage can achieve quality survival.&quot;<br />Both the content and the methodology will be of interest to anyone concerned with forward planning, as well as to the general reader.<br />Anyone interested in the long- and shorter- term future of humanity will find this book a fascinating and extraordinarily rich source of material and ideas.It is a tour de force to have been able to assemble and make sense of so much information while maintaining a simple, undogmatic and eminently readable narrative. If you want material on which to base conversation, speculation or analysis about our future, look no further!	2003-10-05

In plain English, this means moving from seeking to persuade customers that what you have is what they want, to seeking to really know how you can add value for customers by understanding how you can best contribute to their quality of life. <br />The authors argue - convincingly - that the key to profitable survival is to make this change successfully. The authors are successful in conveying the depth of change required for most companies to achieve genuine partnership of this kind.<br />The basic principle that the authors propose is simple. They work logically through the many changes that are needed to move from being a product- centric to a people-centric company.<BR>They make the point that this change requires that the company learn a great deal about its customers and that customers supply this information willingly - something that smaller 'niche' companies are likely to find much easier to do than the global giants.<br />The authors also make a brief excursion into relationships between employer and employee, making related points about the importance of building intimacy, trust and loyalty.	2003-10-05

As a successor, it does not have the impact of the first book, and it goes into issues of learning disabilities to a level of detail that can be tedious to those who are familiar with these issues. None the less, it is very useful in reinforcing a sound appreciation of the value of scenarios and the importance of the process by which they are generated and used.<BR>There are very useful summaries at the end of each chapter and at the end of the book.

The 'process enneagram' at its core is a remarkably effective and compact tool for mapping the elements needed to bring about desired change in a way that is transparent for all stakeholders. It will be valuable to anyone concerned with organizational effectiveness.<BR>How you should approach the book, and in what sequence, depends heavily on your own learning preferences. It is written for those who like to move from (very lengthy and detailed) anecdotal examples to principles and concepts. If you prefer to move from concept to such brief example as you feel you need (as I do), you could easily reject a valuable book - as I very nearly did. For example, the thesis depends on a particular use of the enneagram, a tool that will be unfamiliar to many readers. The first systematic explanation of what the process enneagram is, its origins and uses and its dramatic difference from the much more familiar form of enneagram which the author calls 'the enneagram of personality', occurs 2/3rds of the way through the book in Chapter 7.	2003-08-06

Gower have a long tradition of publishing Handbooks on aspects of management, and the quality is consistently good. Each is structured for easy reference, and each makes use of acknowledged experts in their respective fields. Another characteristic is that each chapter ends with a set of references for those who want to go further into the specific area covered by the chapter. This new edition brings together a team of experts under a world leader in the field, to offer very comprehensive coverage, with each of the 43 chapters excellently referenced for those who want further detail in a particular area.<BR>It is a monumental book (660 pages). With its exhaustive coverage of every aspect of current supply chain management and its probable development, it is indispensable for anyone working in the field, or whose work depends on sound supply chain management by others - which covers most of us. However, its scale makes it rather intimidating for those who simply want to understand the scope of the field without going beyond the main principles. For these readers, the first four or five chapters give a reasonable strategic overview, or they could go to Hugos: Essentials of Supply Chain Management, which is designed to provide an appreciation of key principles rather than depth of detail.	2003-08-06

This is another in the growing family of books which discusses the structure of organisations to replace traditional hierarchy and build empowerment within the framework of a knowledge based economy.<br />The difference, and what makes it worth reading, is that its author has a long history as a successful chief executive - both of a large division within Shell and of a start-up biotechnology company - refining his ideas and putting them to the test in practice.<br />He discusses the conditions in which people will work effectively together with minimal reliance on authority. The title reflects his view that this can occur when organisations are arranged in 'compartments' of not more than two or three hundred people, within which there is completely open communication - with heavy reliance on building informal communication links, a high degree of democracy and great emphasis on designing working relationships for organisational learning. A somewhat different set of rules, in his view, should mediate relationships between compartments and between groups of compartments and the outside world.<br />In developing his thesis, Fairtlough makes use of the concept of 'heterarchy', a somewhat clumsy term, but one which is used to distinguish leadership in which responsibility and authority are shared by everybody from 'hierarchy', in which authority flows from the top and from 'anarchy' where there is no authority. Its virtue as a concept is that it reconciles the idea of empowerment with that of a residual hierarchical power, by clarifying the domains in which each operates.<br />This is a thoughtful and well read chief executive writing informally and with a great deal of relevant anecdote, for people who face similar issues to himself. I think many senior managers will find wisdom and useful practical advice in it.	2003-05-13

It is written for the general reader, contains a wealth of sometimes quite startling facts (the ore processed to produce a pair of gold wedding rings would fill a hole 10 feet long, 6 feet wide and 6 feet deep!) and gives more attention to what needs to be done and how to do it than to describing what is wrong.<BR>It is a book for the citizen, the student and for use in political dialogue rather than for business people seeking to improve the sustainability of their operations, (for which see Hawken, Robrt, Nattrass and others).<BR>The book has three purposes. The first is to make the case that we have no alternative to restructuring the economy if we want economic progress to continue in the decades ahead. The second is to describe not only the broad structure of the eco-economy, but some of its details. And the third is to outline a strategy for getting from here to there in the time available.<BR>It sketches the need to move to an eco-economy based on renewable energy and an approach to materials use that mirrors the natural cyclical processes. It also reinforces the systemic nature of change, involving deep changes in societal attitudes, linked to cooperation between government, community and business.<BR>Chapter 4 The Shape of the Eco-Economy offers some interesting predictions about the industries and professions that are likely to expand, and to act as drivers in the move towards sustainability. This is in support of his point that, far from the move being a threat to our economic health, it offers vast opportunities for investment and for true economic development.	2003-04-30

The forty or so pages of part 1 and the Conclusion provide a good summary of key questions relating to effective learning and the key themes that can be found in reflective learning. Readers are likely to want to scan the 16 case studies for examples that relate to their situation. Each is carefully written up, but the style makes for dense reading and is more likely to appeal to the specialist than the general management reader.	2003-04-30

Books	5	12	12	N	N	Measuring progress toward sustainability	The sustainability of business and economic activity has become a major issue for global business and for government at all levels. But there is no universally accepted definition of 'sustainability' and measurement of progress toward sustainability is still more art than science. What is measured, how it is measured, what range of indicators are appropriate, how one values the present in relation to the future and how one arrives at a final judgement where ecological, social and economic indicators move in different directions, are all matters of intense debate.<br />This book, which is specifically identified as 'work in progress', makes a valuable contribution by teasing out the questions, alternative definitions and the underlying mental models that inform them. The authors list and discuss various approaches that have been taken to developing useful indicators.<br />They then develop in some detail a systemic approach to developing sustainability indicators for a project, based on the idea of Systemic Sustainability Analysis (see key points below). Essentially, the method proposed is systemic, seeks to identify and encompass multiple perspectives and is developed for a specific purpose in measuring sustainability of a specific project or situation. While it is proposed as a method that has very general application, it emphatically is not a 'general theory' of sustainability - i.e. a set of rules and measures that can be applied to all situations.  It will be interesting to see the successor, which is due to be published in May 2003.<br />I suggest that the reader should go to Chapter 7 after reading the Foreword and before tackling the main text. It provides an excellent overview of the issues in dealing with indicators.<br />My only disappointment is that there is no mention of The Natural Step, the body that uses an approach that seeks (in my opinion very successfully) to provide an approach that is systemic, offers 'simplicity without reductionism', and derives four broad parameters against which to judge movement toward or away from sustainability. There is also no mention of the 'triple bottom line', varieties of which have recently achieved popularity as a surrogate for measuring sustainability. I expect that will be covered in the succeeding book.	2003-04-30

The wider exposition of principles is mainly a restatement - and sometimes an elaboration - of principles that can be found elsewhere, including on the Internet sites of The Natural Step.<BR>Those who are working directly with the framework as consultants or part of an internal team will pick up useful ideas and tips.

It is a lucid, very readable account that takes in the whole sweep of history from the time of Muhammad to the present day. It explains the very different 'mental models' that are dominant in the Islamic and Western worlds and works through the consequences of those differences and of the history of relationships between the worlds. It includes an analysis of the influence of Saudi Arabia (through Wahhabi teaching) on the growth of Muslim radicalism and a description of Al-Qaida and the rise of terrorism. Both are shown to be perversions of the tenets of moderate Islam, but both can be attractive to those who feel under threat.	2003-04-30

It is presented as 'work in progress', is very comprehensive in its identification and coverage, with a set of 22 linked tools. It is designed for reference rather than to be read as a book, and fills a very important gap in the management literature.<BR>The 22 linked tools are in various stages of development and the authors cover both how available tools should be used and what remains to be developed. For example the chapter on environmental indicators covers both the current state of the art and a frank discussion of current problems.<BR>A notable feature of the book is the quality of the listing of further reading and available Internet sites at the end of each chapter.

The founder of The Natural Step has written what is partly a history of its foundation and growth, partly an explanation of the principles by which it operates and partly a guide to the future of the move towards sustainable operation. It is also partly autobiographical and gives a fascinating insight into an extraordinary career.<BR>Of interest to those concerned with sustainability, to systems thinkers, business strategist and to the general reader who seeks to understand the underlying principles that are elsewhere so well concealed in complexity. Robrt's genius is in two fields: the first is in revealing the easy to understand (but less easy to apply) principles that provide a guide to moving toward sustainability, and the second is in developing and applying a form of dialogue that invites people into the creative process.<BR>The Natural Step is an international movement which provides education and support for commercial and government organizations seeking to move to sustainability. It does this by providing a framework, a process and case and other materials for assessing sustainability and developing a strategy to move towards full sustainability while maintaining or enhancing commercial viability.<BR>It offers a proven methodology for moving toward sustainability, which is valid at every level from the global to the personal, and is applied in a way that recognizes the requirements that the business (or whatever) remain viable at every step. This book by its founder is a valuable addition to an important literature.<BR>While the whole book is useful, Chapter 2 (Systems Thinking and Consensus), the second half of Ch. 5 on Communication tools, Chapter 6 (The System Conditions for Sustainability), and Chapter 10 (The TNS Framework) are vital to understanding the principles and their application. The metaphor of the tree and branches in chapter 2 is absolutely fundamental to understanding the approach - get away from arguing specific detail (the 'leaves') andfocus on the few driving principles ('the 'trunk and branches') that drive the complexity in the leaves.<BR>Each case study makes a particular point. If you choose only one, Ch. 11 the McDonald's case is the one to go for, but each is carefully constructed to illustrate a specific principle.	2003-04-30

(quoted on P. 128 of Walking the Talk).<BR>The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is an association of over 160 large companies who believe that the imperatives of making a profit are compatible with \\"... [running] their companies in the best interests of human society and the natural environment, now and in the future.\\"<BR>The book seeks to explore the opportunities and problems in doing so, and to describe the progress made over the last ten years. It is overtly evangelical, seeking to recruit more successful businesses (and specifically their CEOs) to the cause of sustainability as the authors define it. The authors are writing within a mental model that believes in the benefits of free markets, globalization, continuing economic growth and in the contemporary model of business. Although they recognize that there are alternative mental models, their primary purpose is not to address these, but to persuade those who share their broad views (which would include the vast majority of business people) that a concern for environmental sustainability and social justice is good business - that pursuit of these wider goals is the best way of ensuring a healthy bottom line now and in the future.<BR>The book is well argued within its framework. More important, it carries the names of three of the world's most senior Chief Executives, which gives it immense clout in its avowed task of persuading other CEOs to joint the sustainability movement.<BR>A 'foundation' chapter, which describes the business case for sustainability, is followed by a brief overview of each of ten key elements in moving toward sustainability, with each chapter illustrated with detailed case studies (significantly, they are nearly all companies and utilities which supply to industrial markets).<BR>In building their case, they identify the dilemmas, and particularly the issue of how to balance concern for the future with prudence in the present. They also note that current market failures (failure to price for 'externalities', perverse subsidies, inappropriate tax regimes) make it more difficult to persuade many companies that pursuit of sustainability is in their best interest. In consequence, they call for partnership with government to correct these problems, and describe experience to date and needs for the future.<BR>The 'ten building blocks' therefore include chapters on The Right Framework - what conditions are needed for business success truly to reflect sustainable operation - and From Dialogue to Partnership - how to enter partnership with the full range of stakeholders. <BR>Too much of the literature on sustainability is taken up with immoderate attack on business and globalization - often with the inference that it is inherently evil - and equally immoderate defence of the (implied) perfection of the present state of globalization and behaviour of companies. It is therefore very refreshing to have an impeccable business source that acknowledges the move to sustainability as important business that is still in its early stages and is prepared to describe the successes, failings, dilemmas and rewards on the journey to sustainability.<BR>Given their objective, there are some important and difficult issues that the authors do not tackle. For example, Hamilton in Growth Fetish, points to:<BR>* the inadequacy of economic measures of progress,<BR>* the importance of a distinction between growth and development and<BR>* the evils of a framework that systematically promotes over-consumption.<BR>These issues need to be argued, and could have very serious implications for business, but they are not the subject of this book.<BR>Those who have a radically different view of the current business system and who disagree with the authors' views on globalization may well see the book as simply offering symptomatic solutions without tackling the real issues. They will none the less take comfort from the fact that community protests about unacceptable business activities (environmental degradation, comfort to repressive regimes, sweatshop labour) clearly send signals that influence the behaviour of corporate decision makers.	2003-04-30

Set in the context of globalization both of trade and of the capacity to mount attacks on cultures/communities that you consider to be hostile, Singer examines a selection of key policy decisions and institutions from an ethical viewpoint. These include:<BR>* The ethics of a political position that gives absolute priority to the perceived short-term interests of the citizens of one's own country (particularly issues of poverty and environmental protection) - mainly in the Chapters &quot;One Atmosphere&quot; and &quot;One Community&quot;, and ending (in &quot;A Better World?&quot;) with a brief discussion of issues and alternatives for a better solution to the governance of a single world;<BR>* An ethical critique of the World Trade Organization's defence against four key charges - in the Chapter &quot;One Economy&quot;;<BR>* A similar critique of the arguments advanced by global corporations for trading with dictatorial regimes - also in the Chapter &quot;One Economy&quot;; and<BR>* An examination of the basis of international law, in particular the ethical basis for military intervention in another country - in the Chapter &quot;One Law&quot;.<br />A notable feature of the book is the wealth of factual detail that Singer brings to underpin his case. Further, he avoids the trap of mere utopianism by the rigour and practicality of his arguments, while insisting on the importance of the ethical dimension in resolving the issues.<br />The care with which he lays out his arguments will provide food for thought for both sides of the divide about globalization, while his use of ethics as a touchstone highlights the sad fact that few current global policies, including the Iraq intervention, are ethically defensible.	2003-04-30

His new book has a much broader reach, being concerned with the development of network technologies and the implications for business strategy across the whole range of stakeholder and competitor relationships.<br />The author has demonstrated that the success of his first book was no mere flash in the pan. He writes excellent colloquial English, develops his argument clearly and logically and uses examples and illustrations well to clarify the main points in his argument (unlike the many authors who seem to use examples to overwhelm rather than enlighten). The subject itself is an important one and, although Dawson is not alone in tackling it, his book is the one I would choose as a guide to understanding and action for the practical business person. (For example, I find it more approachable than Verna Allee's The Future of Knowledge, which is written at a more conceptual level and is rather more difficult to read.)  It is one of the few books I have read which is clearly informed by an implicitly (as well as explicitly) systemic view of the world. <br />Living Networks elucidates these systemic relationships and then proposes strategies to achieve successful competitive placement within the systems that the entity chooses to try to influence. Its prescriptions are also based on values that are made explicit in various parts of the book - for example the value on retaining and fostering diversity despite globalization and the importance of operating in ways that build trust.<br />The book is arranged in four parts: Evolving Networks; Evolving Organizations; Evolving Strategy; and Future Networks (the evolution of business). Each of the ten chapters in Parts 1 to 3 ends with a summary section connecting it to the argument in the rest of the book.<br />Part 1, Evolving Networks, is a short introductory section that starts by identifying five key issues that the author seeks to explore. These are the impact of networking technologies on:<BR>* the nature of relationships between companies and those they deal with;<BR>* ways of working and relating within organizations;<BR>* innovation and intellectual property, with a particular emphasis given to the importance of open source models of innovation;<BR>* strategy in an economy in which strategic positioning in relation to the flow of information and ideas is becoming critically important; and<BR>* the need for styles of leadership that move beyond the box of traditional command and control and position their organizations effectively within networks, while developing their capacity to recognize, bring together and exploit intellectual property.<br />Part 1 provides the base for the main focus of the book in Parts 2 and 3. Part 2 describes the evolution of organizations in a systemic world governed by the rules of complexity, but from the particular perspective of networking, relationship building and innovation. The description is complementary to that in books like Moore: The Death of Competition, Hock: Birth of the Chaordic Age, or Youngblood: Life at the Edge of Chaos, all of which provide different insights on the same general phenomenon.  <BR>13 action steps are offered for building network presence.  In order to keep the scope of the book within reasonable bounds, the important issues of privacy and of intellectual property are mentioned, but not discussed in any detail.<br />Part 3 turns to strategy. The thesis is that:<BR>Devices, communications, and industries are all converging into one vast space for doing business. This is the flow economy, in which almost all value is based on the flow of information and ideas. Companies must continually reposition themselves in this flow economy, both to meet new competitive challenges ... and to take advantage of ... emerging opportunities.<br />The single chapter in Part 4 develops 10 propositions or forecasts:<br />* We will soon be immersed in connectivity [access will spread and bandwidth will become greater]<BR>* Transparency will drive business and society [suggesting that privacy will vanish]<BR>* Collaborative filtering will be the heart of the networks<BR>* Information filtering will be an evolutionary battlefield [marketers trying to insert messages and technology and other means becoming available to exclude them]<BR>* Open, accepted standards will predominate<BR>* almost all value creation will stem from collaborative relationships<BR>* Collaborative intellectual property models will flourish<BR>* Highly virtualised organizations will be a dominant force<BR>* The rapidly increasing pool of free agents will be polarized [the rich will get richer and the poor poorer]<BR>* People and networks will merge [technologies for integrating the human and the machine are developing].<br />These are of course forecasts or bets on the future. The development of their implications makes interesting reading and provides a possible direction. Whether we want to, or do go that way is another question. As with the debate on globalization, what we can do, what we should do and what we will do are not necessarily the same and depend in large part on the underlying 'rules of the game', including the measures by which we judge success. What those are and should be is a debate that is taking place at the level of societal governance ? a debate of immense importance to us all.	2003-03-06

This is a collection about the reshaping of the business enterprise. Whether the underlying driver of change is 'the digital revolution' or whether it is simply the emergence of new perspectives on business is probably not a profitable argument. Certainly some of the best articles in this collection have little to do with the Internet as such and a lot to do with rethinking business models.<br />Carr's introduction is particularly good - and is the one part of the book that subscribers to HBR will not have had the opportunity to read already.<br />In Part 3, there is a very engaging article by Ricardo Semler, best known for Maverick! It is essentially a description of how an entire enterprise has set itself up as a powerful forcing bed for developing and supporting every individual and group within the organization to act as entrepreneurs. By extension it is a powerful condemnation of the loss of potential creativity - and profit - in 'conventional' organizations.<br />Part 1 ends with a truly startling article entitled 'Transforming Life, Transforming Business: The Life-Science Revolution'. It is startling not for what it says, which is that genetic engineering in all its forms offers enormous business potential, but also carries with it great difficulties, both technically and of acceptance. The startling thing is that there is no mention - not even the whisper of a suggestion, either in the article itself or in the appended note by the Editors of Harvard Business Review - that there are ethical issues to consider and resolve. If this article reflects the thinking of those engaged in the genetic engineering industries, it is no wonder that they have a problem!	2003-02-25

As a result these issues are often not recognized, discussed or addressed.<br />The book is written in the context of the explosion in litigation, which both confuses the distinction between ethics and legality and can also constrain ethical behaviour through fear of litigation - as recent experience with various churches has demonstrated. Its three parts - Money, People, and The Common Good - take common examples from each arena in order to help the business reader find ways of addressing these issues and continue to operate with due regard for profit but do so 'with an understanding of what we stand for in the way we make choices and decisions'.<br />In covering money, the author deals with issues such as the limits to monetary fiddling to ensure you can pay your payroll, the ethics of bankruptcy in the context of US law, what and when to disclose when a threatening situation arises. Chapter 4, How to Make a Decision When You Don't Know Enough, also contains some simple, even folksy, advice on how to check whether your decision is ethical.<br />The chapters on People include some extended discussion on the ethical failures of omission and commission that flow from fear of litigation - and the side effect of allowing ethical issues to be treated as purely legal questions to be decided by the lawyers rather than the managers.  They also discuss the establishment of an ethical working environment and the limits to the help to be given when an employee encounters personal problems<br />The chapters on The Common Good go into the murky dividing line between (arguably legitimate) posturing, spin-doctoring and concealment and outright lying and spying. This is written from the point of view of the individual in business. It is a valid perspective, but does not provide coverage of the systemic impact on business - and indeed politics and governance - of the progressive debasement of the ethical coinage that flows from acceptance of these not quite dishonest practices.	2003-02-24

I felt exactly the way the average customer feels when confronted by a high pressure used car salesman. These people were here to sell me something - and anything goes if it clinches the sale.<br />Having said that, there is value in the book as it demonstrates areas in which business and customers can work together to find arenas of social activity that are to their mutual advantage. It also puts forward good examples of why it is to the advantage of a company to engage in these sorts of activity and that they can turn a profit out of it as well.<br />The first two chapters are better forgotten. They set up the least sophisticated of the arguments against globalisation as a sort of straw man that they then tear down with decidedly simplistic and statistically dubious arguments. (It is one of the banes of this very important debate that each side presents totally 'authoritative' statistics that 'prove' the exact opposite of each other. However, these authors argue that the gap between rich and poor is not growing wider, which *really* requires some fancy definition bending.)<br />In the rest of the book, it is necessary to ignore the underlying theme that anybody who criticizes an aspect of business practice or the current global system is antibusiness and because some business is doing things well and responsibly all business is therefore beneficial. Neither extreme position is true. This leaves the possibility of becoming interested in the examples that they cite of good practice and thinking, with them, of how these examples could be spread and expanded. There are clearly many opportunities and it is equally clear that the authors' particular promotional skills will often be useful in identifying these opportunities and working out effective ways of getting them accepted and implemented.	2003-02-18

As the title implies, they are mostly concerned with innovations in product range, process and markets, but some touch on culture and there is substantial discussion of strategic partnerships and mergers. The focus is on managed sustaining innovation (extending and expanding existing ranges) rather than disruptive innovation (replacement of product ranges and markets, typically through technological change).

Lawrence bases his book on in-depth interviews with a wide range of organizations and does a masterly job of synthesizing the findings and presenting them in an informal, highly readable and logical way.<BR>Lawrence is particularly good at conveying the systemic connections between the drivers of change and the various organizational responses to change. For this reason the book provides an excellent guide both to understanding and for action. The main arguments and findings are well summarized through the book, which makes it easy to focus on issues of specific concern, such as downsizing, mergers and strategic partnering.<BR>Because the book is based on interviews with executives of organizations, certain important drivers are not highlighted. For example, although the fact that customers (both business and personal) are becoming more demanding is highlighted, the underlying changes in attitudes between the generations is not. Similarly, the rapidly rising concern with sustainability does not figure strongly. This is perhaps a reflection of what is in the consciousness of the author's respondents, rather than a reflection on the author himself.	2003-02-18

The book offers a practical and detailed example of the establishment, implementation and evaluation of the virtual community, with examples of the tools used by the project team at Clarica.<br />The authors introduce the notion of communities of practice as a new strategy to leverage knowledge capital to create sustainable competitive advantage. By valuing communities of practice, by recognising the contribution of community members, and giving support for time and commitment) and providing an infrastructure (e.g. giving them a communication platform, active facilitation and information resources), the authors suggest that organizations can increase the speed of innovation and knowledge sharing.<br />The Community Development Process Model (p.137) provides an excellent 'roadmap' to the approach they undertook that is readily understood. Practical suggestions and tools about evaluating the value of the community are also provided.  There is a good combination of theory and practice and, therefore, something for anyone interested in this topic. It has a balance between high-level strategic models, and detailed and practical examples. <br />The approach taken at Clarica was systematic and project-managed, with the organization playing a very active role in facilitating the conceptualisation, establishment, growth and expansion of the community. The organization obviously provided significant resources to undertake the project. Virtual communities of practice, like the one described in the book, clearly require strong organisational support and resources due to the technological infrastructure they require to be effective.<br />The authors do not purport to provide a recipe - rather, they tell a story about the introduction of a virtual community of practice in one organization - as such, the book offers an in-depth view of the process. The questions asked at the end of each chapter are intended to challenge readers to assess whether the approach described would work in their own organization.<br />Practitioners may be tempted to read more widely to find alternative approaches to developing communities of practice, and to select 'the best of the best'. The Clarica approach is only one way, but it does provide sound conceptual models that set the strategic context, as well as diving directly into the detail. There is a useful associated website.	2003-02-18

It has succeeded brilliantly, and deserves very close study, whether or not you agree with the drafting committee's views.<br />This is no extremist anti-corporate, anti-capitalist text, although it does clearly come to the conclusion that the vector of economic globalisation that we are on is neither inevitable, desirable nor sustainable. It is notable for arguing at the level of underlying principles and their practical consequences - it makes explicit the assumptions underlying corporate globalisation and questions them. This, in itself, is a valuable service as so much of the 'debate' in the media proceeds on the basis of bald assertion of essentially fallacious economic dogma.<br />The report starts with a critique of 'corporate globalization'. The term itself is useful, because the term 'globalization' has become something of a 'Humpty-Dumpty' word ('when I use a word, it means exactly what I want it to mean, neither more nor less'). 'Corporate globalization' describes a process driven and promoted by the large global corporations which, whatever its other consequences, gives primacy to the benefits that will flow to global business.<br />The critique identifies eight key features of corporate globalization:<br />1. 'Promotion of hypergrowth and unrestricted exploitation of environmental resources to fuel that growth <BR>2. Privatization and commodification of public services and of remaining aspects of the global and community commons <BR>3. Global cultural and economic homogenization and the intense promotion of consumerism <BR>4. Integration and conversion of national economies, including some that were largely self-reliant, to environmentally and socially harmful export oriented production <BR>5. Corporate deregulation and unrestricted movement of capital across borders <BR>6. Dramatically increased corporate concentration <BR>7. Dismantling of public health, social, and environmental programs already in place <BR>8. Replacement of traditional powers of democratic nation-states and local communities by global corporate bureaucracies.' <br />It demonstrates each of these propositions and explores who are the beneficiaries of application of these policies. One of the complexities of trying to follow the arguments of the pro- and anti- globalisers is that both use statistics, both from apparently authoritative sources, that directly contradict each other. It is almost as if the two sides inhabit parallel universes that operate in different ways. Suffice it to say that the report puts forward convincing arguments in support of its case.<br />The critique proceeds to a devastating analysis of the impact of the World Bank, The IMF and the WTO, the three pillars of corporate globalisation, over the last four or five decades.<br />The report then argues ten principles for sustainable societies, as a basis for identifying ways of realising these principles in the subsequent chapters of the report.  It argues that these principles 'seem to be the mirror opposites of the principles that drive the institutions of the corporate global economy.'.<br />One of the minor problems in the debate is that, whereas 'globalization' rolls easily off the tongue, 'the principle of subsidiarity' is neither easy to say nor obvious in its meaning. The report contains a chapter on the case for subsidiarity, and it is a strong one. The counter argument is almost entirely concerned with power. While there are many elements of conflict between corporate globalisation and the principle of subsidiarity - local control - they are not entirely antithetical. But the reach of the large corporates would unquestionably be reduced.<br />You may or may not agree with the arguments in this report, but they deserve serious attention. They are well and carefully argued, they represent (in fairly sophisticated terms) the views of a growing number of people around the world who believe that current beliefs and institutions serve them poorly, and they show those who wish to promote change a path for doing so.	2003-02-18

Taking the view that businesses are evolving into 'networked patterns of living systems', Allee observes that we require a different mindset and management tools to respond to these changes. This new mindset includes thinking of organizations as living systems, understanding the principles of networks and how they operate, taking a 'whole-system' view of the organization, understanding how intangibles go to market, and the significance of value networks, people and relationships.<br />Overall, the book offers a fresh, thought-provoking look at what have become already become well-worn concepts in the knowledge management field. Allee has synthesized a diverse array of ideas and concepts and theories from multiple disciplines to this work. <br />Part I tends to be a little abstract and theoretical and some of the ideas here about the new knowledge economy and intangible assets will not be new to anyone familiar with knowledge management. However, it does provide a useful context for subsequent chapters. At the end of chapter 5, the checklist of 'where we are now in the learning journey or knowledge continuum' is a useful summary of current thinking. Allee takes an organic view of knowledge networks and communities, such that rather than trying to create them in organizations, it is better to simply find those that already exist and make them visible to themselves and the rest of the organization.<BR> The discussion on how intangibles 'go to market' challenges the notion that we can create value from them in the same way that we do from tangible assets. But perhaps the most interesting section of the book is that which discusses mapping value networks, and the practical examples that are provided. It is here that Allee brings together the concepts discussed in Part I and we begin to see the whole picturethat she is building. These chapters will be of particular interest to practitioners who are attempting to grapple with creating value from knowledge in their own, or their client's organizations, and identifying where to focus their attention.<BR> Allee has the capacity to discuss complex issues in a simple and straightforward way without allowing us to feel that we've been shortchanged. Essentially, each chapter offers a simple message. In her discussion of communities of practice, there is a clear message is that knowledge cannot be separated from the human networks that create it, use it and transform it. Similarly, in Chapter 6, she argues that the best technology infrastructure does not guarantee knowledge sharing - organizational intelligence is not a technology question, it is a human question.<BR> At one point, Allee refers to the ancient saying that one cannot step into the same river twice (pp. 143) because the water is never the same water. This is analogous to what Allee has done with in this book - although the concepts, and ideas may seem familiar and have certainly been discussed previously in the plethora of books and articles currently available, she has presented them in a refreshing new way and brought together diverse ideas to challenge our assumptions. It is well worth reading.	2003-02-18

The thesis is simple - good innovation relies on people who are not committed to the status quo. The advice on how to handle dissenters from the status quo who have original minds is sound but sometimes a bit tedious and obvious. However, we need to remember Tom Peters dictum 'Obviously, the obvious is not so obvious', as Horibe demonstrates how often corporations shoot themselves in the foot.<br />The author's starting point is the vital necessity of innovation to the health and survival of corporations and the fact that innovation - good ideas carried through to market success - is typically disruptive to existing business and typically driven by people who are not wedded to the corporate status quo. Senior executives and the corporate structure itself on the other hand, tend consciously or unconsciously to make life difficult for these dissenting innovators. The book is about relationships between the dissenters and the corporate 'establishment' and how these relationships can be managed productively.<br />She points out the critical difference between continuous improvement and true innovation, which is frequently disruptive. Neither the drive for efficiency nor the trend to team working contribute directly to innovation in the wider sense and both may in fact work against it. She builds the case that it is dissenting individuals who have the vision and the passion to carry genuinely new ideas through to market success, but that typically in a large corporation they do not have the power to do so.<br />The core of the book is devoted to an analysis of the nature of dissent, how it is typically suppressed and what is needed for the management of an organization to recognize, support and encourage potentially productive dissent, while also maintaining sensible boundaries of authority.<br />Each chapter ends with a summary and statement of key points. My advice is to start with these and, if they are not obvious to you or you want further explanation, go back to the main text. The points made are well set out and logically developed, but I found the explanations and illustrations unnecessarily long-winded.<br />Managing dissenters is, of course, only one aspect - an important one - of the complex question of how to build and maintain a successful strategy of continuous innovation, supported by culture of innovation. A listing of books on the subject can be found on my site.	2003-02-18

The standard of the papers is very high and there is a good balance between theory, research and practice.<br />A popular conceptualisation of intellectual capital is that it has three components: human capital, structural capital and relational capital, as described in Nick Bontis' literature review. This conceptualization is extended in the chapter that describes competitive capital as a potential fourth pillar of intellectual capital. Practitioners will be interested in the measures that have been developed in relation to learning capacity and knowledge management orientation. Similarly, the chapters which discuss intellectual capital reporting (Development and Implementation of an Intellectual Capital Report; Understanding Intellectual Capital Statements; Measuring and Reporting Intellectual Capital in European Pioneering Firms; Intellectual Capital Disclosures in Swedish Annual Reports) will be of interest to managers attempting to identify, understand, describe, and account for intellectual capital in their organizations.<br />This book provides a really good overview and state-of-the art in relation to intellectual capital, particularly in relation to measurement methods, and intellectual capital reporting in organizations, and this compilation is a must-read for academics and practitioners alike.	2003-02-18

At the same time, how the Internet interacts with other influences and what social and technological trends are going on under the surface is not well understood. It is, however, so central to the development of our economy and society that it is essential to understand it.<br />Manuel Castells has produced a brilliant analysis of these issues. The book is written for both an academic and a general readership and meets the needs of both excellently, although some parts of it are reasonably hard work for the generalist. The reward, at least for this reader, is a far clearer understanding of the dynamics of development of our networked society and the issues that need to be confronted. It is essential reading for anyone concerned with economic or political development at any level from local community to global issues.<br />In style the book belongs to what I think of as the European tradition of clear and careful analysis and exposition, rather than the common American approach to business books of heavy reliance on drawing conclusions from examples derived from 'great name' companies. The result is a book that requires serious concentration in order to follow the complex, sometimes contradictory and paradoxical influences that the author elucidates for us.<br />It is directed primarily to the reader as citizen, rather than specifically aiming to help business people toward profitable application of Internet technology. In consequence, as well as providing a valuable overview of the dynamics of development of our national and global economy and society, it contains useful reflections on ethics and governance at the business level and also on the potential benefits and risks to the development of civil society nationally and internationally.<br />The author's starting point is that (the dot points following are slightly modified quotations excerpted from the 'Opening' to the book):<BR>* The technology of the Internet provides the means of bringing together reliance on networks, dominant in private interaction, with the capacity for coordination of tasks and management of complexity, for which organizations have historically relied on hierarchical command and control. <BR>* The logic, language and constraints of the Internet are not well understood beyond technological matters.  Popular understanding is driven by myth, ideology and gossip more than by a realistic assessment of the issues. <BR>* People, institutions, companies and society at large, transform technology by modifying and experimenting with it. The Internet transforms the way we communicate and do things and, by doing many things with the Internet, we transform the Internet itself. <BR>* It follows that the Internet is a particularly malleable technology, susceptible of being deeply modified by its social practice, and leading to a whole range of potential social outcomes - to be discovered by experience, not proclaimed beforehand. Neither utopia nor dystopia, the Internet is the expression of ourselves - through a specific code of communication, which we must understand if we want to change our reality. <br />The first two chapters offer lessons from the history of the Internet and a description of the culture that gave rise to, and sustains it. Chapters 3 through 6 discuss e-business, the new economy, the concepts of virtual communities and networked society and key political issues of civil society, privacy and liberty. Chapter 7 is concerned with multimedia, while Chapters 8 and 9 are concerned with the geography of the Internet and the digital divide. There is an 8 page conclusion on the challenges of the network society, in which the mask of the analyst slips somewhat to reveal the passionate advocate of what Soros in The Crisis of Global Capitalism called the open society and to echo Laszlo's call in Macroshift for a 'fundamental revolution of consciousness'. Castells argues:<br />&quot;Until we rebuild, both from the bottom up and from the top down, our institutions of governance and democracy, we will not be able to stand up to the fundamental challenges we are facing. And if democratic, political institutions cannot do it, no one else will or can.&quot;	2003-02-18

The book is therefore framed within an explanation of the implications of complexity theory for non-human and human systems. The book starts with a brief overview of the development of scientific thought, emergence of the theory of 'complex adaptive systems' and its application to business. The overview includes a useful explanation of the important distinction between non human and human (purposive) systems and the implications for a view of business based on complexity. Businesses, at least those that offer a physical product, necessarily contain both kinds of system, as well as containing both linear and complex systems, and strategy has to recognize this explicitly.<br />The author then discusses the implications of this fact for the structure and strategy processes of a business, including the distinction between what he calls 'doing' or 'instrumental' processes and 'knowing' or 'strategic' processes, which must be harmonized continuously and adaptively to produce strategies. He argues that strategic processes are concerned with principles and models, while instrumental processes are concerned with rules and behaviors, all of which interact.<br />From this starting point, the balance of the book is concerned with explaining, developing and applying (through examples) a structure of diagnostics - essentially strategic questions - that a business needs to work through in order to develop strategies and strategic processes that not only meet current competitive needs, but adapt to unpredictably changing circumstances and take advantages of opportunities arising from continually reconceptualising the business within a clear understanding of business purpose.<br />If you are familiar with any of the business literature that rests on systems thinking, complexity or theprimacy of knowledge management in contemporary strategy, do not expect to find dramatically new ideas in this book. It is a well structured presentation of reasonably familiar precepts, laced with relevant examples and good common sense advice on some of the balances required and the pitfalls to be avoided. The questions proposed as diagnostics appear to be thorough and comprehensive, although I would have preferred to see a more user-friendly form of presentation than the largely narrative style that is used.<br />As ever, the step from knowing what ought to be done and why it is being done to successful implementation is a large one, and the author does not go in any depth into the human issues of bringing plans to fruition. He does however stress the importance of clear purpose, shared understanding and a culture that encourages learning and draws forth the creativity of all participants within the business and across the stakeholder chain.	2003-02-18

Doz and his colleagues claim that it is to become metanational and to become good at innovating from a platform of bringing together knowledge from many different parts of the world. Metanationals differ from globalized companies in that they recognise that new ideas, products or directions may originate somewhere other than the corporate centre.<br />The focus of the authors is on innovation and they argue that this requires that the organization becomes good at :<BR>* identifying where good ideas and special competencies are;<BR>* mobilizing the often scattered capabilities and opportunities (they use the term 'becoming a magnet' for such capabilities); and<BR>* optimising the size and configuration of operations for efficiency, flexibility and financial discipline.<br />This is a book that makes an important point about success in a globalized world, but presents one factor in success as if it was the whole. As with a number of books, I had an uncomfortable feeling that the content of a very good article was expanded into an only moderately good book.<br />The core message is important and useful. Organizations that operate on a global scale need to move beyond the extension of a unitary culture into new localities and recognise that new knowledge is found in unlikely places. They need to become excellent at recognising that knowledge, becoming an attractor for it, mobilizing it to provide a superior stream of innovations and operationalizing production, distribution and marketing into diverse markets.<br />The weakness is that the book is written at a fairly high conceptual level - for all the detailed example - that fails to get to grips with how to manage multiple cultures or the detail of innovation, or the issues of governance across countries. It also has surprisingly little on the major changes that are occurring in world consumer markets.<br />The book also fallsinto the 'one size fits all' trap. Issues of being effective globally are very different for a consumer fashion business, a high tech product or service industry and a major commodity business, but this is not recognised explicitly in the book.	2002-09-26

(The book is written around business organizations, but its content applies very well to public sector organizations as well and will be useful to public sector knowledge managers.)<br />The authors' focus of attention is - explicitly - on communities within (almost by definition quite large) organizations, and how they can be cultivated as a key element in the organization's success. Although the authors acknowledge that communities of practice can and do cross organizational boundaries, their attention to this aspect is cursory. As a result a number of very important issues (for example the degree of openness permitted/encouraged where communities cross organizational boundaries, the challenge to professional loyalties, access by specialists who are isolates within their own organization to communities of practice across the nation or the world, the management of communities of practice across strategic alliances) do not get attention.<br />That is about my only criticism and is almost more in the nature of a plea for someone to provide equivalent coverage of that critically important and growing field of interest.<br />The book defines communities of practice (COP) in relation to other groupings (for example it makes a useful distinction from communities of interest, while acknowledging that the distinctions are 'fuzzy' - see the useful table on P. 42). It also identifies the key roles, key elements and principles affecting the successful operation of COPs and factors requiring attention over their life cycle. The authors also identify diseases of COPs and their causes, address the difficult issue of measuring and managing value creation through them and provides guidance on the role of the management structure of an organization in fostering and supportingCOPs within it.	2002-09-26

Titles can be deceptive, particularly when chosen with an eye to capitalizing on fashionable jargon. 24/7 Innovation is primarily about building a climate of continuous organic change and is more about change management and organizational learning than innovation in the commonly used sense of product and service innovation. However, as the author rightly points out, change and innovation in all its forms tends to be seamless, and success depends on embedding a system of goals, relationships, attitudes, processes and technology that work together to support continuous challenge to the status quo in support of superior customer service.<br />Shapiro argues for what others have called a 'tight-loose' structure, one within which a limited number of well articulated principles allow for substantial freedom of action at all levels and locations, with carefully selected measures and incentives to link endeavour to the core goals. The author's preferred metaphor is jazz, which encourages creativity within simple structures.<br />He claims that his approach differs from others - particularly reengineering and TQM - in seven respects. While the attributes are not all as uncommon as he implies, they are worth quoting, as they are all important:<BR>&quot;* It is strategic. Innovation is targeted at the critical parts of the business that differentiate it from its competitors.<BR>* It is pervasive ... permeat[ing] every aspect of an organization ...<BR>* It is holistic, acknowledging the ... interdependence of all aspects of the business<BR>* it is focused on creating value ... not ... cost cutting and streamlining without regard for the impact they have on customers and other stakeholders ... and customers in particular.<BR>* It emphasizes governance ... referring to the leadership of a business that sets the standard ...<BR>* It uses technology as an enabler, rather than an answer.<BR>* It recognizes the critical role of people. Innovation is carried out by people for people.Success comes from an uncompromising commitment to an organization's people.&quot;<br />A strength of the book is the structured way in which the elements required for success are set out and explained. This is a 'how to' - a blueprint - but not the simplistic 'seven step' framework that so many authors offer. It works logically through the various capabilities and attributes needed, with guidance on how to build them.	2002-09-26

Organizations in stable environments may encounter major strategic issues involving high residual uncertainty, while those in very dynamic environments may have issues involving low uncertainty. The strategic process must be appropriate to the situation.<br />The book is concerned with how to answer the five basic questions above in the context of each level of uncertainty, and which tools are most appropriate for guiding the decision process. The tools discussed in the Appendix &quot;The Uncertainty Toolkit&quot; are:<BR>scenario planning<BR>game theory<BR>decision analysis<BR>systems dynamics models<BR>management flightsimulators.<BR>In essence, what the author has done is to frame a set of known tools and principles within McKinsey's preferred structure of analytical rigour. If you still believe that 'classical' strategic planning round the business case is the only way to approach strategy, the book may help widen your options. If you are already familiar with the various tools offered, the main benefit of the book will be to provide a useful reminder that levels of uncertainty differ, and a framework for thinking about your own situation and response to it. Perhaps the most important message in the book is not to assume uncertainty until you have carried out the analysis needed to separate the knowable from the truly uncertain.	2002-09-26

The last chapter touches on wider issues including the vexed questions of valuation of knowledge and of ownership of knowledge, but does not go into these in any great depth. The rest of the book is concerned with the practicalities of identifying and exploiting the commercial potential in various forms of knowledge held in 'knowledge objects' or by persons.<br />The aim of the book is to help practitioners 'to build a thriving knowledge business'. Broadly, it works within well-established conceptual principles. Its value lies in the thoroughness of its identification of the various forms of commercial offering, where they can be applied, their strengths and weaknesses and what a seller of knowledge needs to do to be successful.<br />At first, the book looks indigestible. I nearly put it aside before recognizing the value contained in its rather dense structure. If you contemplate using the Internet to sell knowledge products, it is well worth persisting. The table of contents and index are good enough for the book to be used as a ready reference.	2002-09-26
US	50859589	RLVQZT57L042A	075062874X	528543582	Changing the Way We Work	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Quirky but useful	Since 1980 or earlier, Belbin has been concerned with the way in which we work together and what it is that makes joint work effective. <br />In his earlier work Belbin identified nine team roles, each of which has a place in successful design and completion of the work of a team. He argues that each person has most and least preferred roles, that the balance of requirements for success tends to change over the life of a project, and that team performance can be greatly enhanced through attention to matching skills and preferences to the role needs. His typology is by now quite well-known, links well to personality preferences such as those measured by the Myers Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI) and has been melded with MBTI in at least one popular 'instrument' used for analyzing individual and team performance.<br />In Changing the Way We Work, Belbin turns his attention to the nature of work and ways in which it can be organized. His system is derived from an analysis of the nature of jobs, tasks, roles and responsibilities, the various ways in which work can be undertaken by individuals or in groups or teams, and the variety of possible relationships between the manager and those undertaking the worker. <br />His system makes use of colour coding of seven classifications of work. Both the classification and the colour coding are designed as a tool for building a shared language within an organization through which work requirements and alternative approaches to executing the work can be discussed and agreed.<br />In some ways, Belbin's analysis reads as being rather 'old-fashioned'. This is because he develops his argument about the nature of work, tasks and roles from a historical perspective, reaching right back to the days of work study (or industrial engineering) and tracing the development of concepts of the job through time study, the development of synthetic standards and the rise of derivative methodologies such as reengineering. One side effect is to make thebook a rewarding text for those interested in the history of the development of work organization. Another is to establish a very solid foundation for understanding the distinctions between a job, a task, a role and associated responsibility. This is valuable because these distinctions are often lost in material on this subject.<br />By taking this historical approach, he provides a solid basis for identifying types of work arrangement derived from the nature of the work itself and proceeds from there to explore how this interacts with the preferences of workers. Part of the value of this approach is that it provides an alternative perspective to the popular current view which tends to work back from worker aspirations and motivation to the work to be done.<br />The style of the book is unusually personal, laced with examples from the author's personal journey to develop his typology and sometimes illustrated with quite curious examples such as the author's preferred way of using a potato peeler.  <br />In a world dominated by North American texts, this book could only have been written by someone from an English culture, and some people are likely to find the style and cultural assumptions to be distracting. However, whether or not you accept the system as a whole, the material gives a great deal of well structured food for thought.	2002-09-26
US	50859589	RB5EOLDFFAJGY	0071362940	4794237	21 Leaders for The 21st Century	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Understanding dilemmas	Charles Hampden-Turner and Fons Trompenaars have been collaborating for many years to develop an understanding of how different cultures approach and resolve problems and the cross-cultural issues that arise from it. In the course of this collaboration they have developed a formidable database of responses from managers around the world, and a 'dilemma methodology' which they use to demonstrate how superior results flow from the way in which dilemmas are managed and resolved.<br />This book is a direct successor to a series of books by one or both authors, which develop the methodology and its application. This one applies it to the question of effective leadership, and makes a valuable contribution to a generally overcrowded field. In particular, it adds to understanding of the particular skill of an effective leader and also helps to build an operational understanding of what is meant by 'managing a culture'. The book can be read and used without reference to the earlier works, but Building Cross-Cultural Competence is particularly useful in providing an extended statement of the principles and dimensions summarized in the first 2 chapters of 21 Leaders.<br />The nine opening pages of the Introduction provide a succinct overview of the main thesis, described as a 'metatheory of leadership'. They argue that leaders 'manage culture' by fine-tuning and reconciling dilemmas and that that culture then runs the organization. Outstanding leaders are particularly adept at reconciling dilemmas - they make the necessary distinctions yet integrate them into a viable whole. The authors conceptualise apparently opposed values (eg individualism versus communitarianism) as being the opposite ends of a continuum and the test of successful reconciliation being that both values should emerge stronger from the interaction.<br />The book and most of the examples are based on issues of cross-cultural in the sense of cross-national values, but the principles apply equally wherever there is a potential clash of values - for example in a merger or a major program of change.<br />Through expanding their methodology and showing how it applies in a wide range of complex situations the authors seek to help leaders :<br />&quot;Elicit and become aware of major business dilemmas in cross-cultural environments<BR>See dilemma resolution as a crucial ingredient of strategy<BR>Utilize dilemmas as strategic contexts for action<BR>Learn the art of achieving one value through another in a virtuous circle (a process known as through-through thinking)<BR>Learn how transnational entrepreneurs take their stands (preneur) between (entre) contrasting values.&quot;<br />Much of the book is devoted to case studies of the 21 selected leaders. These are not all the 'usual suspects' of the management literature, but include a former Russian Prime Minister and the heads of companies in a variety of industries and from a range of nations. Each is well-written and argues its particular points in a way that gives depth to the main thesis of the book.	2002-09-26

The Springboard belongs on any short list for best business book of its year. It is an essential addition to the bookshelf of anyone, executive or consultant, who is concerned with the management of change.This is a book that I will keep with the half dozen or so to which I constantly refer. <br />The context of the book is the introduction of knowledge management into a very large organization - The World Bank - but its relevance extends to any and every aspect of the change process.<br />The form of the book is an extended story about storytelling and the impact of a particular type of story in engaging the attention and commitment of people to necessary change. It is written directly, simply and with a poet's precision of language, which makes it immensely readable. Many of the books that I review, I skim for points of value. This one I read from cover to cover, and enjoyed doing so.<br />The thesis is a simple one and the extended framing story about the development of knowledge management within The World Bank, which makes up the book, proves the thesis. Change is driven both by the logic of the relationship of the organization to its environment and by the interaction of human hopes, fears and preferred perspectives (mental models) with the 'objective' situation. When new departures are needed, an appropriate story can engage the imagination and creative powers of the audience, where analysis and logical argument may only engage the critical faculty. A story can provide the means of circumventing an unacknowledged fear of change and built-in defences by enticing the audience to participate in the creation of a world that overcomes problems which affect all of them. Denning's thesis is not that a story is all that is needed; it is that the initiating power of stories has been neglected in our culturally preferred analytical approach to problem definition and problem solving.<br />I happen to have been working with an organization that seeks to do on a smaller scale some of the things that The World Bank does on a very large scale, and is currently experiencing many of the issues that Denning describes in The Springboard. Both his diagnosis and his prescription ring absolutely true. In every chapter I found explanations, ideas and suggestions that are immediately useful and helpful, not only to that situation, but to any change management situation.<br />There are five invaluable appendices summarizing aspects of the development, presentation and performance of springboard stories, structures for building up a springboard story and examples of stories with explanatory marginal notes on the role of each part of the story. These provide an extremely useful ready reference for the practitioner.	2002-09-25

There are more books written on the theory of 'boundaryless', non-hierarchical, adaptable organisations than good case studies of organisations that have consistently worked successfully that way.  The Peaceable Kingdom is therefore especially welcome, particularly as it is so easy to read - even seductive.<br />It is a 'first person' account of the growth of a major Dallas, Texas based advertising agency and the continuing and successful efforts of the founder in (to quote the sub-title) &quot;Building a company without factionalism, fiefdoms, fear and other staples of modern business&quot;.  It is a story of continuing success over many years, and also a story of continuing effort over the same period to ensure that the principles and practices that fuelled the growth are not subverted by growth in size.<br />There is little or no 'management theory' in the book, just the views and experience of the author and his colleagues.  While written in the first person, the book is a group effort, in which the skills of highly professional copy writers combine to produce an engaging, colloquial narrative that is extremely easy to read and conveys its very important messages lightly.  I started to skim it for ideas and found myself reading the whole book for pleasure.<br />There is nothing remarkable about the philosophy and underlying principles themselves.  They rest on:  * a passion for quality,  * a belief that others have the same passion and need the freedom to express that passion,  * the application of humanity and common sense,  * an insistence that 'management' is part of every job, not the special preserve of a special group,  * the creation and maintenance of a loose, organic structure that retains the advantages of intimacy in a fast growing organisation, and * insistence that 'communication' has to be active, universal, frequent and direct.  <br />What is remarkable is the consistent application of these principles and the way in which the conditions necessaryto achieve the culture have been put and kept in place.  <br />There are plenty of 'take-home' messages in the book, but it is not arranged as a 'seven step how-to-do-it'.  Indeed, the emphasis throughout is on the holistic and systemic nature of building and maintaining a culture.<br />For a more conceptual treatment that rests on the same principles, see Lewin and Regine The Soul at Work: Unleashing the Power of Complexity Science for Business Success.  It includes several case studies (including one of the English advertising agency St Luke's), and seeks to provide guidance on both theory and practice. <br />Two other books come to mind as providing case studies from other industries and the approach of other individuals to achieving the same goals.  One is Dee Hock's extraordinary Birth of the Chaordic Age, the other is Ricardo Semler's Maverick! The Success Story Behind the World's Most Unusual Workplace (reviewed in 1995, short review only).  Both are very different from The Peaceable Kingdom but rest on very similar principles.	2001-05-19

Argues that the rise of the knowledge  economy makes it even more urgent to organise in ways that support human  cooperation and creativity.  Builds from human biology to identify the  social capital required to support generation of intellectual capital.<br />It  is increasingly accepted that the only sustainable source of competitive  advantage in 'the knowledge economy' is to tap the full creative potential  and capacity to learn together of the humans who are the most important  asset of any organisation.  Yet most organisations continue to behave in  ways that directly work against realisation of that potential.<br />The  replacement of the dominant 'machine' metaphor of organisations with an  'organic' metaphor has become commonplace in the literature and its  implications for organisation, culture and style of management are clear.   But this is not (at least yet) having any dramatic effect on organisational  behaviour.  Perhaps a different metaphor is not a powerful enough tool to  start the process of changed consciousness.<br />Charles Ehin takes a  different approach to a similar end.  He goes right back to the genetic and  evolutionary foundations of human behaviour and our basic drives.  From  that he draws out conclusions about the cultural environment - the social  capital - that needs to be in place to produce the high levels of  collaboration needed for vigorous intellectual capital generation and  market responsiveness.  In effect he is offering a scientific rather than a  metaphorical argument for changed behaviour by organisations.  We need to  understand our basic human nature so that 'we can narrow the gap between it  and the organisational context rather than unknowingly widening it.'   Throughout, he uses relevant and engaging examples from his personal  experience to illustrate his case.<br />The fundamental argument rests on two  sets of innate human drives:  self centred and other centred (cooperative  or  communitarian).  Each of these drives is continually present in all of  us.  The socio/cultural or organisational environment or context is a major  factor in calling forth on or the other set of drives.  What he calls  'controlled access' - or hierarchical - organisation triggers the  self-centred drives: dependence, compliance, self preservation.  What he  calls 'shared access' - essentially reliance on self-organisation -  triggers the other-centred drives: self-direction, interdependence,  commitment, trust.  While each set of drives can manifest itself under  either style of organisation, the hierarchical form is hostile to the full  flowering of the other-centred drives.  Further, engagement of the  other-centred drives and development self-organisation are interdependent:  the development of self-organisation can only proceed through engagement of  these drives in a reinforcing loop of development.  The loop is driven  through nurturing four fundamental interacting competencies:<br />common  purpose (shared values and vision); sense of community (building trust,  empathy and compassion); 'line-of-sight relationships' (face to face  activities and interactions); visualising wholes (fostering the ability to  see wholes and understand and work with whole systems)<br />Ehin argues that  it is precisely these drives and associated competencies that are essential  to organisational success in a knowledge economy.  <br />The elements in his  case are well illustrated in a series of figures through the book,  particularly Fig 2.1 (P. 36), Fig 5.1 (P. 104), and the detailed two-part  system chart in Figs 7.1A and 7.1B (Pp. 152-3).  I found it useful to copy  those charts so that they were in front of me for reference as I read the  text.<br />The book is a valuable addition to the literature on the learning  organisation ( Senge et al. The Dance of Change), on management under  complexity (eg Lewin: The Soul at Work), on working with whole systems (eg  Pratt et al.: Working Whole Systems) and on knowledge management and  innovation (e.g. Leonard- Barton: The Wellsprings of Knowledge).  I suspect  that a number of readers will be willing to take the argument about human  nature on trust, without reading it in depth, but the model and the  relationships underpinning it deserve careful attention.<br />The assault on  the hierarchical castle continues, and Ehin has thrown in another  battalion, opening one more front.  However, the walls remain unbreached.   The sad reality is that most hierarchs are hooked on power and the belief  that things can only go right if they personally make the decisions.  The  objective of retaining and expanding personal power often (even if  unconsciously) outweighs the objective of achieving commercial success and  blinds the hierarch to the fact that the two are often in opposition.<br />The  acceptance of the current geological theory of tectonic plates took 25  years, when all that was at risk was the reputation and knowledge base of  the then generation of geology professors.  More is at stake in this shift  in the way we see our organisational world; we are probably looking at  generational change to achieve the shifts that Ehin advocates, but it is  never too soon to start.	2000-08-14

The explanation of the 'knowledge foundation'  (Ch.7) is particularly valuable. <br />Chapters 1 through 6 develop the  argument that globalisation and the knowledge economy together amount to a  major continuing revolution in the way the world works, and that this  revolution is a continuing process, not an event.  Chapters 1 through 5   work systematically through the major changes associated with the knowledge  economy and globalisation, while Chapter 6 draws important conclusions for  the organisation based round six major changes including the level of  workforce education, changes in employment, the development of IT in  general and groupware in particular, and culture shifts.<br />At this point,  Neef introduces the critically important concept of 'high road' and 'low  road' organisations and a third group of independent knowledge workers.   Essentially, the world is moving towards dominance by a limited number of  knowledge based, global organisations, with much of the physical production  carried out by relatively small, undercapitalised, low wage 'low road'  companies engaged in a 'race to the bottom' and an intermediate group of  independent knowledge workers. <br />These corporate polarities are strongly  reflected in society, with the trend toward increasing inequalities of  income and wealth.  Statistics of national wealth are becoming less and  less meaningful as the world and nations (even the USA) divide into 'high  road' wealthy 'hotspots' (Silicon Valley, the Bangalore region of India  etc) and 'low road' areas of economic stagnation or decline.<br />Chapter 7  contains a very useful overview of the place of knowledge management in the  world of business.  By way of introduction, he points to the confusion  caused by the division of KM exponents into 'high-touch' and 'high-tech'  groups, where the first are interested primarily in working relationships  and culture and the second see KM as primarily a function of new  communications technologies, with a third group who see KM 'simply as a way  of capturing and distributing leading practices or lessons learned.  He  seeks to integrate these perspectives around seven broad practice  areas.<br />The rest of the book goes broad again, to look at impacts on the  social fabric on global competition and implications for (US) national  policy.  It highlights the implications of 'high road' strategies relative  to lack of an explicit strategy or 'low road' strategies and concludes that  national government intervention is necessary to ensure that appropriate  strategies are followed at a national level.	2000-06-13

They are of a uniformly high standard.<br />This is a very valuable  reference resource in what has become a rather incoherent field - with a  welter of definitions and perspectives.  The Yearbook is a well balanced  and well organised guide to navigation to available resources that also  contains a very well chosen selection of articles to cover the various  aspects of knowledge management.<br />Most of the articles are directed either  to clarifying important concepts  - for example Karl-Eric Sveiby's article  on Tacit Knowledge - or to improving some aspect of practice - for example  Charlotte Roberts on 'Can We Talk?', which is concerned with conversational  skills.  There is a wealth of useful frameworks and tools and some very  useful summaries of key concepts such as the transformation that occurs  between explicit and tacit knowledge.  The emphasis is on human aspects of  knowledge management rather than the technological end, but both receive  good consideration.<br />In order to test the coverage, I worked through as  many relevant themes as I could think of and checked whether I could find  something useful on each theme.  The only ones I did not find were the  relatively new concern with physical design of space to enhance knowledge  creation and transfer (an important part of knowledge infrastructure), and  discussion of group meeting techniques for building shared understanding.

Its scope, range and command of detail is awe-inspiring and its analysis is fresh, sceptical of all dogma and challenging. It is a work  in the grand tradition of Adam Smith and his contemporaries, written for  the general reader.  <br />The author seeks to 'trace and understand the main  stream of economic advance and modernization.' In doing so, he ranges from  ancient times to the present (but concentrates mainly on the period since  about 1450) and across all major geographic areas and cultures. <br />As is  true of Smith, Landes' analysis is founded on acute observation of what has  actually happened in economic history and on an analysis of possible causes  that ranges across all aspects of human behaviour and institutions, not  merely those aspects that are conventionally deemed to be 'economic'.   <br />The questions he addresses are:<br />How and why did we get where we are?  How did the rich countries get so rich? Why are the poor countries so poor?  Why did Europe (&quot;the West&quot;) take the lead in changing the world?   <br />To grossly oversimplify a very sophisticated analysis, his conclusion is  that culture has been a dominant influence.  Looking forward, he sees a  continuing tension between growth and social equity in which one can not be  dogmatic about either the continuance or the proper role of the State.  He  mentions but gives little real attention to the issue of ecological  sustainability, which many would see as the dominant issue to be faced  within the next few decades.  He assigns a major role to the conditions  that allow a free market to operate, but does not fall into the trap of  quasi-religious dogma about the virtues of a free market as such.<br />What I  like most about the book is that the author treats his readers as  intelligent people who are entitled to form their own opinions.  He does  not conceal his own, but nor does he force them down your throat.  For me,  the main lack in the book is that little attention is given to the  all-important questions - has the growth in population and resource use  caused a change in the way we need to look at our relationship to the  natural world? is the way that we choose to measure wealth still  appropriate to the situation that we have created?  The author touches on  these vital questions but does not seek to address them in depth.<br />This  book makes an interesting companion/comparison to Jared Diamond's brilliant  'Guns, Germs and Steel'.	2000-06-09

This is one of them. It offers an extremely  valuable typology with which to think about and develop the leadership  role, based firmly on the imperative of a solid basis of core values.  An  invaluable tool for developing the leadership function in organisations and  skills in individuals.<br />Stuart Wells offers a deceptively simple and very  rich framework for thinking about the leadership function and for building  personal and organisational leadership capacity, consisting of nine  management roles, framed within three foci of managerial effort and three  principal leadership processes.  The whole of the book is an explanation  and elaboration of the model.<br />Points to notice about the model are:<br />*  first, that the explicit articulation and demonstration of a coherent set  of core values lies at the base of the effectiveness of all the roles;<br />*  second, that the author is concerned with roles, all of which contribute in  different ways to the success of the organisation, that collectively make a  difference to organisational success and that may be exercised  cooperatively by different people within a team or group.  The model is not  about the superhuman abilities of the 'hero' leader;<br />* third, that each  role lies at the intersection between one of three leadership processes and  three foci of managing effort - at different times and in different  situations different combinations of roles may be critical to moving  forward.  Each role is itself distinctive and different from the  others;<br />* fourth that the nine roles are learnable, but that in each  individual they will be differentially developed and each individual with  have natural preferences, strengths and weaknesses.   <br />The model is  focused on observable roles and their impact, rather than on:  * the innerqualities of a leader (eg Jaworski 'Synchronicity'),  * the stance of a  leader in relation to the authoritarian/participative continuum (eg Bower  'The Will to Lead'), or  * the way in which a network of leadership may be  developed within an organisation (e.g. Senge: 'The Dance of Change').   <br />These different perspectives are complementary to each other.  Wells'  distinctive contribution is to separate the discussion of important and  continuing roles from the mythology of the 'hero' leader that is implicit  or explicit in so much writing about leadership.<br />The author's claims for  the book are modest.  He explicitly recognises that leadership is learned  from practice, not from books and he offers the book as a guide to self  assessment and a guide to building practice and confidence in each role.	2000-06-09

As you would  also expect, it is focused on large corporates, and on strategies for their  business success, as measured by exceptional growth and returns to  stockholders.<br />It provides one important perspective on the issue of  corporate growth and development, to be compared with other  perspectives.<br />There are obvious comparisons with Collins &amp; Porras:  'Built to Last' both in the concern with continuing exceptional performance  over an extended period and in the care taken to explain the research base  from which the findings are derived.  However, whereas Collins &amp; Porras  are concerned primarily with values and culture, Baghai et al are primarily  interested in strategies for the selection, development and management of a  portfolio of businesses and the implications of those strategies for  structuring, staffing and operations.<br />The fundamental thesis is simple  and can be stated in a few propositions:<br />The companies that have been  successful in maintaining high rates of growth with superior profitability  are those that have learnt to manage well to three different time horizons  at the same time - today's business, the next generation of emerging  businesses, and the longer term options out of which the next generation of  businesses will arise.<br />In order to develop longer term options into 'core  profit engines', a series of measured steps (concerned with finding ways of  profitably building core capabilities and markets) are required, which the  authors call 'stairways'.  In the nature of things, not all stairways will  lead to future core businesses, so a variety of initiatives need to be  carried forward together.  Management of the 'stairways' should receive  significant senior management attention.<br />The skills and temperaments  required to manage current business, to develop new business and to search  out viable future options are widely different one from the other.  The key  to maximising the profitability of today's business is excellence of  execution.  Emerging businesses require business builders - the typical  entrepreneurial temperament, while the identification of future options  requires lateral thinkers and visionaries.<br />In consequence, the style of  organisation and internal culture most appropriate to each of these foci  are also different.  Large corporates tend to find difficulty in  encompassing these very different cultures. The authors discuss in some  depth the resulting issues of internal culture, recruitment, structuring  and transition, and their strategic management.  <br />The strength of the  book is that the authors identify a key issue in business success - the  development and maintenance of a vigorous portfolio of businesses over the  longer term - and work through the implications with clarity and  thoroughness.  <br />The cost of that approach is that other equally  significant issues are assumed or left in the background.  It is necessary  to balance the valuable perspective offered with others that are also  important.  It is also necessary to be aware of the underpinning tacit  assumptions - for example, the underlying metaphor of organisation adopted  by the authors appears to me to be much nearer that of the organisation as  a (money) machine, than that of the organisation as an organism.  There is  a marked contrast with the emphasis in, for example de Geus: 'The Living  Company'.  This is not to say that either is wrong, only that neither is  complete.	2000-06-09

By technology we mean beliefs,  values, methods, processes and techniques that enable collective decision  making to work successfully&quot;<br />The authors say that their purpose in  this book is 'to explore and develop ways in which working together  co-operatively as peers can become easier, more effective and more  accessible'.  They succeed.  It is well structured to open and address  important questions about working in relationship, and it contains useful  tools and exercises to help to develop cooperative working.  Perhaps the  main virtue of the book is its simplicity and directness.<br />The three parts  first lay out the underlying ideas, then explore the relationships within  which a peer approach can be applied and finally offer over 60 exercises  designed to help in developing peer partnerships.<br />The underlying belief  on which their processes are based is that 'the best decisions for social  organisation are made by involving everyone affected by the decision'.   There are very strong parallels between the philosophies and processes that  they advocate and those that are necessary to successful search conferences  (see authors like Weisbord &quot;Discovering Common Ground' and Bunker and  Alban 'Large Group Interventions').  The difference is that Hunter and her  colleagues are exploring how widely these beliefs and processes can be used  across the whole range of decision making and interaction.	2000-06-09

This book is a genuine 'must read'.<br />Eileen Shapiro follows her  own precepts.  She claims that many failures of business plans can be  traced back to inadequate or faulty observation.  Her book is based on very  careful observation, backed by a formidable analytical capacity, a rapier  wit and direct and forceful writing.  It is a sort of modern equivalent for  today's executive of the King's clown in the middle ages - a sceptical eye  to remind him that he 'is but a man' and therefore at risk of the errors  and occasional blindness to which everyone is subject, particularly when  seduced by success.  <br />Shapiro goes further and outlines the simple tools  which, when used consistently and well, can provide some protection from  these errors.  If the book were a sermon - and it is far too funny to be  that - its text would be her quote from Pogo of the comic strip 'We have  found the enemy ... and the enemy is us'.<br />Her selected sins, in short  form, sound like the seven cardinal virtues - but the bite is in the  tail:<br />&quot;* Trusting in your terrific plans ... even though you have  lost sight of what your real strategy is. * Reinvesting in your outstanding  products ... while the market is moving in a different direction * Focusing  on playing to win ... when in fact you're playing the wrong game by the  wrong rules. * Assuming a team of turbo-charged employees ... while short  changing the investments needed to build workforce judgment and skill *  Focusing on workplace sizzle ... but neglecting to provide the motivation  that matters * Taking pride in being a learning organization ... even  though key decision makers are unable or unwilling to see the facts for the  creed. * Investing in sophisticated forward intelligence systems ... while  consistently falling backward in the battles that count.&quot;<br />The short  Introduction (do *not* skip it) sets the framework, including a brief  statement of the sins and their genesis and of the three premises on which  the book is based:<br />* The essence of a manager's job is to make difficult  decisions intelligently, in environments of continuing and unpredictable  change. * Change is a constant, but is lumpy and a combination of the  predictable and the unpredictable. *The enemy of making good decisions is  not change per se, which is just a fact of business life, but unchallenged  beliefs, which are a matter of managerial choice.<br />Each Deadly Sin then  gets its own chapter, starting with a series of dot points identifying  symptoms that each may be present.  The chapter contains headings  highlighting the issues and possible cures.<br />Common sense tools appear in  every chapter.  What is important is that Shapiro shows how to apply them  perceptively, with useful and sometimes jaw-dropping examples.<br />She ends,  very appropriately for a book with this title, with Ten Commandments for  Freeing the Corporate Mind - which deserve careful attention.<br />The cycle  of organisation learning and 'mental models' are at the core of this book.   Critical to success in avoiding or overcoming the 'sins' are the quality of  conversation within the organisation, how well it uses the cycle of  learning at an individual, small group and whole organisation level and how  well it uses difference to enrich joint perceptions.  Three other excellent  books that take up these issues in greater depth are: Ellinor and Gerard:  'Dialogue' Leonard-Barton: 'The Well-Springs of Knowledge' Dixon: 'The  Organizational Learning Cycle'	2000-06-09

In particular, it takes the concept of a  'business ecology' (see eg. Moore: 'The Death of Competition') to develop  rules for success in a world of 'punctuated equilibrium' - periods of  relative stability followed by chaotic periods due to a destabilising  invader or event, from which a newly shaped ecology emerges, with different  dominant species.<br />While this is a highly simplified view of the formation  of natural ecologies (and of the underlying complexity theory), it is still  useful in looking at dynamic markets. <br />Part 1 looks at market ecologies.  The framework is a generalisation of themes that recur in many other  contexts.  The idea of moving to preempt or build dominance in emergent  market ecologies lies at the base of Hamel and Prahalad's strategy  ('Competing for the Future').  Ormerod in &quot;The Death of Economics'  proposes that economies operate to precisely the same rule of punctuated  equilibrium.  Baskin goes on to draw out rules for business success in  market ecologies.<br />Part 2 takes the same analogy inside the corporation,  looking at the building of identity, the flow of information and  development of the 'corporate nervous system', the issue of organic  community structures and finally the role of senior managers, while Part 3  makes the distinction between change and transformation and highlights the  differences.	2000-06-09

Howard Gardner focuses on the leader as creator, teller and living exponent of a story, and makes an overwhelming case for the centrality of this  function in leadership, and its complement, countering the counter-stories  that exist in the organisation.  Leaders who understand and use this book  will add greatly to their effectiveness.<br />The idea of the leader as living  exponent of a story is combined with the concept of the 'five year old  mind'.  Simply put, even sophisticated people are not sophisticated in all  domains.  In other domains, the common denominator of shared understanding  is the 'five year old mind', the five year old having a very concrete,  literal and emotionally based understanding of the world.  For success, a  leader should know how to appeal to the five year old mind, as well as to  more sophisticated audiences.<br />There are three parts - and do not miss the  preface to the paperback edition.  The first is 'A Framework for  leadership', which states the main thesis.  <br />&quot;When one thinks of the  leader as a story-teller, whose stories must wrestle with those that are  already operative in the mind of an audience, one obtains a powerful way of  conceptualizing the work of leading.  It is important for leaders to know  their stories, to get them straight, to communicate them effectively, and,  above all, to embody in their lives the stories that they tell.&quot;<br />The  second part consists of case studies of people who exemplify leadership  across various domains. It includes examples from each of his two classes  of leaders (direct leaders who engage directly with others in action, and  indirect leaders (like Einstein) who influence others through their impact  on how people see the world).<br />The third looks forward and summarises the  enduring lessons for leadership.  The principles that he extracts are both  important and practical.<br />Approached as a guide to exercise of leadership,  the case studies can be `dipped into', while Parts one and three are  studied for their messages.  If necessary, save the case studies for your  holidays, because they are well chosen, brilliantly told and make  fascinating reading.<br />It is a book that is not only valuable for the way  it treats its core theme.  It also provides an immensely fertile starting  point for thinking about related issues of change.  I first read it during  a period in which I was intensely engaged in promoting cultural change in a  large organisation and was able to relate very directly to Gardner's  analysis and find direct value in his prescriptions.	2000-06-09

I t manages to convey a lot of messages about  the value of combining feminine and masculine ways of thinking and relating  in the course of reflective discussion about situations that have  influenced the author.  Her style of presentation itself helps to  illustrate the points she is making.  Margaret Wheatley hits the mark  exactly with her comment on the back cover blurb:<br />&quot;This very  personal and quietly passionate book asks us to explore aspects of human  nature that have gone unregarded for too long.  We could create so much  more together if we would join Carol on this exploration.&quot;<br />And that  is the point: to 'join Carol on this exploration' requires a willingness to  engage in joint dialogue and joint reflection, which is too rare in the  world of business and administration.<br />It is worth mentioning a couple of  things that the book is not.  It is not 'feminist' in any conventional  sense, it does not seek to promote any one group over any other and it is  not primarily about the place or even the roles of men and women in  organisations.  Frenier has been deeply influenced by Carl Jung and, if the  book has a central theme, it is Jung's concept of individuation, the  fullest possible development of the capacities that are present in all of  us, through the way in which we enter into community with each other and  value difference to aid growth.  All women and all men have aspects of both  the feminine and the masculine within them in varying degrees, and it is  these qualities, not gender, that are the focus of Frenier's  interest.<br />Throughout the book runs the sub-theme of the need to work for  a truly sustainable world and the values involved in living simply.  She is  one of the rare authors who has the courage to challenge us to bring into  explicit consciousness and think through the impact of the largely implicit  assumptions on which business is based - 'more is better', 'growth is the  name of the game' and others, which threaten our long term survival.  She  does this by example from her own experience and by inviting reflection,  not by railing against 'the evils of today's society'.  In doing so she  displays a great faith in the capacity of small changes in attitude among a  wide enough cross section of people to trigger major shifts for the  better.<br />What comes through is the value, for results as well as the  quality of all our lives, of engaging in open, reflective dialogue and  entering into community around the issues that are important to us.  The  feminine within us has qualities which make it much more likely that this  vital process will occur and be valued.  It is an extremely important  message in an environment in which the masculine is visibly cutting out all  the time for reflection that - as the growing literature on knowledge  management amply demonstrates - is vital not merely to our health and  happiness, but to our commercial survival.  <br />Encouraging the group we  work with first to read the book and then to spend time discussing it would  be an ideal way of opening up windows in our minds and expanding ways of  relating.	2000-06-09

This study of the beliefs and values of the major generational groups and their attitudes to each other provides a thorough basis for understanding issues that are likely to arise in the workplace.  The authors highlight  the very different attitudes to work, life and the importance of life style  between the generations. They offer ideas for dealing effectively with each  generation and with the differences between them. <br />The book is readable  and well set out.  A chapter is devoted to each generation group, each with  useful tabulations and comparisons.  This is followed by case studies of  good inter-generational relationships and a couple of chapters of  advice.<br />The book is concerned primarily with the present - that is with  how these differences impact on today's working life, but the sketches of  each generation also provide insights into what may happen to work  arrangements as different value systems become dominant.<br />An interesting  and important question of course is 'What is going to happen to business  itself, its values and its relationship to wider society?'  Unfortunately  this question is not even raised, the implicit assumption being that  business will continue unchanged even if ways of organising and doing  business change.

That is almost every  business except one that is purely in commodities.<br />It is a first class  book: well argued, well written and structured, clear and easy to reference  and use.  It succeeds admirably as a practitioner's manual.  Prior  understanding of the field is not essential, while established  practitioners will find much to learn.<br />Knowledge is defined as 'the  capacity to act effectively'  and 'knowledge management' as referring to  the dynamic processes associated with recognising knowledge as a primary  asset and attempting to make it more productive.  An important consequence  of the definition is that knowledge is held only by people.  The core of  knowledge management initiatives lies in building and developing  relationships between people, and knowledge transfer occurs between people.   The key to effective knowledge transfer is therefore intimacy and  trust.<br />He argues that knowledge, how it is generated, used and  transferred, is probably the key source of differentiation in a world that  is heading rapidly to commoditisation.  Adding value to clients through  knowledge transfer &quot;can only be done with a highly interactive  approach that draws on and develops relationships.&quot;<br />There is a  detailed discussion of the role of information and the critical importance  of understanding how to add the greatest value to information so that it  can become can become valuable knowledge for clients.	2000-06-08

A strategic position is simply the sum of a company's answers to these three questions: Who should  I target as customers? What products or services should I offer them? How  should I do this? ... Ultimately, strategy is all about making choices, [to  achieve] a distinctive strategic position ...  The most common source of  strategic failure is the failure to make clear and explicit choices in each  of these three dimensions.&quot;<br />In itself, the statement is simple, even  obvious. But, as he points out, many companies fail to make these explicit  choices.  <br />The value of the book lies in how the author works through  these propositions.  The advice is good common sense, laced with valuable  insights.  The language is clear and simple.  The approach is systemic -  the author is as concerned with how all the elements fit together within a  dynamic market as with the elements themselves.  Each chapter ends with a  good summary of the arguments.<br />Even highly complex and highly dynamic  strategies rest on these simple foundations.  The book therefore provides  both an excellent guide for those new to wrestling with strategy and  excellent 'mental furniture' with which to approach more complex  formulations.	2000-06-08

It covers an important subject well, but it is not in the same class as the earlier book from the  Mckinsey stable Baghai et al. The Alchemy of Growth. It is concerned with  financial, market segment, and arbitrage (taking advantage of geographic  differences in productivity and factor cost) strategies to achieve  dominance on a global basis within a preferred field. There is no doubt  that these are important, but it is equally clear that they do not provide  a full basis for a successful strategy. There is very little sense of  concern with customer satisfaction or customer intimacy and surprisingly  little concern with attracting and building skills other than to say it is  important. Further, little attention is given to strategic partnering -  alliances between equals - which is currently the focus of a great deal of  strategic attention.<br />My overall impression is that this is another  example of a very good extended article that has been expanded into a 300  page book. It also suffers from a lack of summarisation of the main points.   The overall impression is of a sharp but rather narrow focus on a few key  elements in a successful global strategy, representing itself as the whole.	2000-06-08

Let Go	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Case studies of success with complexity	The goal of most change programs today is a flexible, adaptive organisation with highly motivated people who will identify and exploit new opportunities in ways that contribute to corporate strength and viability  and also to improving the human condition.  To achieve that, what you need  is not better analysis, better extrinsic 'motivation' or better control.   You need to change your focus and the way you see the world.  That is the  message of this set of case studies of organisations that are succeeding in  the hard task of building organisations that are highly successful in  dynamic markets and that fully reflect the aspirations and values of  employees, customers and other stakeholders.<br />The authors are specialists  in complexity science and the dynamics of relationships. The view of  organisation as a 'complex adaptive system' and the belief that the key to  business success in times of uncertainty lies in the quality of  relationship are increasingly accepted.  What this book adds is a clear and  practical synthesis of these streams of thought and practice, based on a  set of detailed case studies that get inside the values, beliefs and  feelings of the participants in wide ranging transformational change.  From  their experiences the authors draw out the reasons for confronting radical  change and the set of values and processes that appear to be most useful  for those venturing on their own necessarily unique journey.<br />A major  strength of the book is its success in conveying what it feels like to  commit oneself to unknown risks in pursuit of a goal that can not be fully  defined.  The external driver is rapid market change, the main internal  driver is the need to reconnect to the human spirit and re-ignite genuine  shared commitment to inspiring goals.  The book identifies the commercial  and psychological rewards as well as the dilemmas and disorientation for  both the leaders and the led as they start their journey, and shows how  apparentlysimple changes can produce the kind of 'limited chaos' that is  needed for creative transformation.<br />OD practitioners should not expect to  find blinding insights into novel practices. The approaches to leadership,  reliance on teams, focus on relationship and use of the existing culture to  find ways of 'nudging' the existing culture into change are all part of  today's currency of change management.  What the authors do is provide  another very approachable way of showing how these elements fit together  and include both a rationale for particular processes and ways of behaving  and examples of the dilemmas encountered along the way.<br />For a really good  'manual' for working with whole systems and with complexity, see Pratt,  Gordon and Plamping: Working Whole Systems (listed at Amazon.co.uk but not  currently at Amazon.com).	2000-06-08

Scenarios are a form of model and both  authors stress that it is the quality of the continuing strategic  conversation that flows from design and use of models or prototypes that  determines the quality of the result.  The model or prototype itself is of  course important, but it is the clarity of the purpose of modelling, the  selection of the participants and the degree and method of their engagement  and the quality of their interactions that is vital.<br />The case is built  around the following propositions that Schrage explores and expands on  through the book.<br />* Changing the economics of play transforms the  economics of innovation ... [and] individual and institutional  behaviors.<br />* Behavior change matters more than technological change.  It  is cultural variables that define how the 'technological toys' succeed or  fail to effect profitable innovation.<br />* In general, the economics of  modelling and prototyping has been transformed from managing scarcity to  managing potential excess (the author has a chapter on the value of  spreadsheets and the perils of 'spreadsheet wars').<br />* Models can be  'engines of surprise', by generating 'results utterly at odds with the  assumptions embedded in them'.  'The challenge is recognizing and  exploiting that unanticipated value.'<br />Like any other business activity,  the return to modelling must be measured.  This raises difficult questions  of metrics, to which the author devotes a chapter.<br />Schrage also explores  the important issue of the development of modelling approaches. As use of  modelling or prototyping expands, the organisation needs to develop 'models  of how it models'.<br />The author quotes Dorothy Leonard-Barton: The  Wellsprings of Knowledge on several occasions and the two books are  complementary to each other.  In particular, Schrage's book expands very  usefully on the brief coverage in Chapter 5 of Leonard-Barton's book and  provides a somewhat different and enriching perspective in doing so.<br />My  only quibble with the book is the minor one that, in seeking to cover a  wide range of ways and arenas in which models and prototypes are used,  there are sometimes confusing jumps from the jargon of one arena of  prototyping/modelling to another.  However, it is helpful to recognise that  conceptual models, spreadsheet models, physical prototypes, simulations and  a range of other tools belong to the same family, are used for the same  general purposes and raise very similar behavioural and cultural issues.	2000-06-08

The rise of the internet has enabled people to restart conversations in a global world, conversations which were interrupted by the rise of giant bureaucracies which were able to use their special knowledge, the power of  advertising and public relations and sheer distance to suspend true market  conversation.<br />That is the basic message of this very unusual book.  Its  corollary is that the balance of power is shifting back to articulate, well  informed and, above all, well linked consumers.  The large suppliers will  try to ignore this at their peril.<br />The book starts with 95 theses which  constitute the 'Manifesto' - presumably a direct reference to Luther's  famous 95 theses against the sale of indulgences (in 1517) that marked the  start of the Reformation in Europe.   One senses a bit of a stretch to get  to the full 95, but the seven pages of the Manifesto are well worth reading  (and deserve a place in many Boardrooms).<br />Like Luther, the authors of  this book want to change things. They are serving notice to big corporates  (today's equivalent of the early 16th century Church) that they had better  start human to human conversation and a bit of old-fashioned listening.  Advertising, 'PR statements' and similar tools are becoming  counter-productive.  (The whole genetically modified foods debate is a  fascinating example of the effect of people power on large  corporates.)<br />This is a book to browse.  It has a serious and important  message about the impact of global conversation on the way business will be  done.  It is discursive, very funny in patches, and highly informative  about the incredible variety of ways in which conversations can now be  maintained.   Its main concern is the impact of these conversations on  business.  I found myself speculating about their impact on politics, which  is becoming at least as profound.  It is a fair bet that within the next  few years, elections will be won or lost on the internet and the sterile  'machine politics' of so many democracies will (hopefully) become an  endangered species.	2000-06-08

The setting for this book is the modern, downsized organisation, in which :<br />&quot;managers and supervisors are continually called upon to do more with less support and are taking on more responsibility - often with less  authority.  This erosion of authority ... is the medium in which the need for  influence as a palpable skill germinates.  This need is then fed ... by  ambiguity, change and insecurity, and grows to be the top leadership and  survival skill required of today's managers.&quot;<br />Much of the material  is a careful and useful codification of principles that are in themselves  quite unsurprising and there are times when sections descend into a  catalogue of what should be fairly obvious.  However, it is very useful to  have a book that makes such a clear distinction between the exercise of  power and that of influence and that gives comprehensive coverage of the  nature and dynamics of different kinds of networks.<br />However, it is a bit  disconcerting that there is no discussion of the ethics of using influence.  Just as the boundaries of the legitimate use of power are an important area  of concern, so should be the boundaries of the legitimate use of influence  and ways of influencing people.	2000-06-08

This is a brilliant successor to Ormerod's previous Death of Economics.  It lucidly and wittily demonstrates the fallacy that economic forecasts can predict.  More important, it further develops his economic theories based  on complexity.  His conclusion: &quot;governments should do much less ..  detailed short-term intervention .. and [spend more time] thinking about  the overall framework.'<br />Ormerod is rare (I am tempted to say unique)  among economists.  He uses clear and straightforward English - and he has a  devastating wit.  Assuming that you bring yourself to read books on  economics, when was the last time that one caused you to laugh  aloud?<br />Butterfly Economics combines clear English, humour and the  capacity to translate the realities of human behaviour into a credible  explanation of the behaviour of economies. It is very readable, even if you  are not really interested in economic theory.  The importance of the book  and its predecessor is that they provide a better explanation of what is  going on than do conventional explanations.  It explains why so much of  government economic policy produces unintended side effects and it also  supports the arguments of Brian Arthur and others that initial inequalities  tend to become magnified.  Behind the simple explanation is some quite  rigorous analysis based on the mathematics of complexity, but this is kept  decently in the background for the sake of the general reader.<br />Whereas  the primary focus of attack in The Death of Economics was the assumptions  underlying 'general equilibrium theory' - the cornerstone of economics and  economic policy - Butterfly Economics concentrates on one aspect of human  behaviour - choice.  It shows what happens when one relaxes the unreal  assumption that buyers form their preferences independently and are not  influenced by the behaviour of others.	2000-06-08

It is very important contribution to our understanding of how to build and manage knowledge assets and, in particular, the rules by which knowledge gains and  loses value and 'travels'.<br />It is directly useful to business people who  have to wrestle with strategies for managing knowledge.  It is also a  formidable piece of analytical architecture that links the management of  knowledge assets to economic theory and learning theory.  Considering the  depth and range of the original thought packed into it, the book is  surprisingly readable, partly because of the clarity and relevance of the  examples with which the author illustrates his concepts.  <br />Perhaps of  widest importance is the clarity and precision of the definitions offered,  in a field in which the definitions have been notably 'muddy'.  One of the  things I have gained from reading the book is a much clearer 'mental model'  of what knowledge management is all about, its dynamics and linkages, and  what is happening at various stages in the development, codification and  diffusion of knowledge.<br />Because of its depth, density and range,  absorbing the content requires real effort, but the effort is very  worthwhile.  It has several different audiences.<br />Knowledge managers:  Those directly responsible for knowledge management will want to read and  understand this book in full. <br />Business Strategists: The book provides a  coherent and well argued rationale for developing strategies around the  exploitation of the value in knowledge assets, based on the clearest  explanation of the dynamics of knowledge value creation and dissipation  that I have seen. <br />Managers of Organisational Change: Anyone concerned  with organisation change also needs to understand the underlying concepts  for their relevance to strategies for learning and to the shaping and  linking of organisational structures.<br />Economists: Chapters 2 - 4 provide  economists with a re-conception of the production function around data as a  factor of production, and an explanation of the nature and dynamics of  information value that is both challenging and important in integrating the  realities of information and knowledge value into economic theory.<br />Those  with a more peripheral or general interest in knowledge management should  at least read:  * the Preface, which is a 2 1/2 page masterpiece in the  expression of the central concept in a compressed form,   * pages 12 - 14  and 18 of the Introduction and  * they should scan Chapter 3: The  Information Space (I-Space) to understand the author's three dimensional  construct and its use.    J-C Spender's short Foreword is also valuable in  putting Boisot's work in context with other work, particularly Nonaka and  Takeuchi's The Knowledge Creating Company.  <br />If general readers are  tempted to go further, they will find an extraordinary range of  thought-provoking concepts along with quite a lot of material that may be  familiar from other writers:  Boisot's primary aim is to get us to think  differently about our world and to recognise that much of our current  thinking about information and knowledge is grounded in the very different  world of the energy based economy.  He provides an alternative framework  that is rigorous, persuasive and practical.	2000-06-08

The style is informal and the examples used  are relevant and exactly illustrate the points being made.<br />It does not  replace fuller guides, such as Ellinor and Gerard's 'Dialogue', but  complements them.  Whereas Ellinor and Gerard is of most use to the  specialist, this book is invaluable for executives and professionals, and  indeed for anyone who is seeking to achieve cooperation in a complex  situation.  It is particularly valuable for the range of its coverage -  from resolving difference within the family to identifying directions for  business. It also addresses the wider issues of how society should develop  and how ordinary citizens can be fruitfully engaged in the decision  processes.<br />The book is in three parts:<br />The Will to Do it: Why Dialogue  is Necessary The Skill to Do it: Strategies for Dialogue The Broader Uses  of Dialogue<br />The discussion in Parts one and two is cast mostly in the  context of organisations. Part three is concerned with the political  process, the divide between the elites and the mass of the citizens, the  nature of knowledge in a societal context and the advantages of dialogue  and barriers to its use in deciding societal directions.	2000-06-08

Neglect of any stage seriously inhibits the process.  The authors do not  deny individual creativity but insist that all of us can contribute to  group creativity if the conditions are right - and that individual  creativity can be destroyed or at least suppressed if the conditions are  wrong.<br />These are very similar to the conditions required for  organisational learning (see Nancy Dixon: The Organizational Learning  Cycle), which is not surprising as knowledge generation and learning are  different perspectives on essentially the same phenomenon.  The two books  in fact make good companions to each other.<br />Chapter 1 draws out some  principles, defines creativity and innovation for the purpose of the book  and outlines the creative process.  <br />While saying that creativity is  resistant to linear progress, the authors identify five steps as capturing  the essential features of the creative process.  They are: preparation,  innovation opportunity, divergence (generating options), incubation,  convergence (selecting options).<br />The steps of divergence, incubation and  convergence are the central (usually iterative) engine of creativity.   Effective management of these steps is vital, and it is the balance or  rhythm of the steps that has to be got right. <br />The rest of the book is  basically about the conditions necessary to ensure that each of these steps  and their combination are fully productive.  How should the group be  structured?  What norms, beliefs and behaviours are necessary for them to  interact creatively? What leadership behaviours are needed?  How should the  process be managed and when, if at all, should there be external  facilitation?  What psychological and physical conditions are conducive to  creative success?<br />The authors conclude: &quot;Creativity, like learning,  is not only a process but also an attitude.  Managing creativity is all  about the values we enact.&quot;	2000-06-08

Do corporations have any obligation to protect the human rights of those affected by their decisions? Large global companies increasingly find themselves facing  ethical dilemmas in their dealings across multiple cultures while in the  spotlight of the media and under the scrutiny of a wide variety of interest  groups.<br />The two authors are distinguished professors in law and ethics.   The resulting book is a detailed, even ponderous study of the philosophical  and ethical considerations that need to inform decision making in these  circumstances. The results are intended for practical application and are  illustrated by a variety of case studies, but the argument is presented in  formidably academic terms and is not easy to read.<br />The core of the model  is a hierarchy in which there are: <br />*  'hypernorms' or universals that  must be observed whatever the culture; <br />* norms or precepts that,  although not universals, are consistent between all significant interests  or stakeholders who may be affected by a decision; and <br />* 'moral free  space' - factors which are not in conflict with any of the higher norms and  where, after consideration of the various interests and stakeholders,  decisions may vary according to company philosophy, culture of the host  country and so on.	2000-06-08

It works through the far-reaching implications of the break down of the old trade-off between richness of a tailored offering and reach to a mass  market, and the explosion in customer access to information.<br />The key  message: if you have a business in which profitable elements in the value  chain or service mix are protected by institutional or other barriers to  entry, it is at grave risk as the barriers are swept away. Businesses will  undergo what the authors call 'deconstruction'.<br />The book goes on to  detail the trends and advise on strategy, both for established operators  and for new entrants.  In essence, you can no longer look at the business  as a single entity.  You need to have a strategy for each element in the  value chain separately and in relation to the other elements, and you have  to recognise and respond to the different rules that face information  businesses and physical businesses.<br />The basic concept put forward in the  book is simple; working through the implications is not. <br />As computing  power grows, connectivity increases and common standards become dominant  the trade-off between richness and reach is displaced.  Structures (such as  a distribution system) that were barriers to competitor entry become  expensive liabilities and economic relationships will change  radically.<br />The changes will also accelerate the breakdown of hierarchical  structures and challenge the boundaries of the corporation.<br />The authors  offer 12 guiding principles to help with the task of rethinking strategy.   They derive from a similar paradigm of complexity and Schumpeterian  'creative destruction', also put forward by authors such as Thurow  (Building Wealth), Friedman (The Lexus and the Olive Tree) and Boisot  (Knowledge Assets).	2000-06-08

This is a valiant attempt to systematise a difficult area of assessment of organisations. Ken Wilber in 'A Short History of Everything' argues that every entity has an external aspect or 'surface' and an internal aspect or  'depths'.  He says 'surfaces can be seen [and therefore measured], but  depths [i.e. interior aspects] must be interpreted'.  He goes on to say  that our society's obsession with measurement results either in depths  being ignored, or in inappropriate attempts to devise measures, typically  resulting in a distorted perception of the interior aspects.<br />Garden has  made a valuable attempt to provide a language for interpretation that can  be shared and that captures within a simple framework ways of 'reading'  types of organisation and their relationships with others (suppliers,  customers etc).  Her aim is explained in the Introduction.  In summary, it  is to build tools with which to 'read' the organization, using perceptual  skills (&quot;and, by this, I mean emotional perception more than  intuition.&quot;, writes Garden).   &quot;It is ... making use of your own  perception, applying a framework based on psychology to business decisions  and strategy as well as emotion, and understanding the way seemingly  disparate aspects of the organization are subtly connected together - that  define what is distinctive about this book.  It attempts to make a  contribution that is additional to our present interpretive framework and  tools.&quot;<br />Tools that support methodical use of our 'innate talents'  for observation and holistic understanding will be profoundly useful.  The  author claims that her methodology works for her and that she has been able  to transfer her skills to others.  The key question is how well these same  skills can be transferred by means of a book alone.<br />Valuable though the  contents of the book are, I do not think it has been wholly successful in  achieving that very difficult goal - which is not to say that it hasfailed.  It provides a platform on which to build. <br />If you are concerned  with organisational change, the book is well worth examination.  You may  find its prescriptions useful or you may not, but it certainly stimulates  reflection about how we understand and convey to each other the rather  intangible forces that are so important to the success or failure of  organisations.	2000-06-08

This is a notably well researched and well analysed study of the phenomenon  and its causes, which goes behind popular cliché-ridden explanations.  The  perspective taken is explicitly feminist, and explicitly political in that  it focuses on power relationships.<br />Those interested in gender issues in  management will find this book indispensable.  It is 'academic' in  presentation, with detailed references and careful linking to other  findings in its field.  However, unlike too many 'academic' books, it is  well written and relatively easy to read.  <br />Perhaps its main virtue is  the breadth with which the subject is approached.  It examines in depth not  only the gender bias of the implicit labour contract - and management  contract - within organisations but also the underlying assumptions about  personal and family life that help to account for the fact that few women  enter top management and few of those have children.  The research method  makes evident the wide gap between rhetoric and reality and also  demonstrates the way in which both language and the very basis of business  organisation (even modern 'delayered' organisation) exert a subtle bias  against the entry of women to the top ranks of management.<br />Even those who  do not have a specific interest in gender issues will find a great deal to  reflect on about the nature of business and society and the relationship  between them. <br />The book also provides valuable material for anyone who  wants to get into real depth on the place of business in a society that  truly seeks to meet its human and not merely its economic potential.  What  are the societal 'ground rules' within which that could be achieved and how  might they be brought into existence?<br />The author does not, in general,  seek to prescribe.  The book is a work of description and analysis,  although we are left with a tantalising last sentence. 'For women and men,  opportunities for realizing alternative visions are overshadowed by the  continued primacy of paid work as the source of status and meaning in  contemporary culture.'  That strikes a particular chord with me, having  recently read a collection of the stories of people - women and men - who  are striving as their main goal to balance the demands of career, family  and community.  The sheer invisibility of work that is not paid recurs as a  leitmotif throughout those stories, together with the powerful  demonstration that it is precisely this invisible work that is central to  the continuance of a healthy community and society.	2000-06-08

The result  is increasing frustration as the old remedies - downsizing, demands for  total commitment from staff and traditional approaches to consumer  promotion become less effective and even counter-productive. <br />They argue  that the world-view of (American) society is  changing dramatically.   They   characterise  the change as a shift from 'communities of wealth' through a  'world out of control' to a world based on 'communities of meaning'.   Whereas society is well into the third stage, many organisations, and  particularly their leadership, have too often failed to change with  society.  <br />The authors claim that a similar and similarly chaotic  complete transformation of organisations and their leadership is needed if  they are to confront the new realities successfully.  The title of the book  refers to the fact that a caterpillar, in changing to a butterfly, does not  go through step by step change, but actually dissolves inside the crysallis  (ie goes through a chaotic stage) before restructuring completely and the  authors use this as a metaphor for what is needed among leaders and among  organisations.	1999-12-08

It is a detailed  description of a world that, in his opinion, ought  to emerge in the new  millennium, together with some prescriptions for what needs to be done to  cause it to emerge.   It is also a sustained piece of evangelism for the  development of a 'mission-directed/ preferred-future culture'.  As such, it  is an interesting and useful example of this genre of writing and this  style of strategic planning, which is becoming increasingly  popular.<br />Interestingly however, it makes almost no mention of the methods  that are most effective in building a broad consensus round a well  articulated vision and set of strategies.  Rather it seems to assume that  this will naturally emerge.  That values and beliefs are changing is  unquestionable; it is much less clear that they are changing coherently or  in the same direction.  The essence of realising a preferred future is in  the way that a coalition of shared values is built up that has the systemic  leverage to cause the world to develop in a particular way.  Ellyard gives  very little attention to this process, other than to say that it requires a  particular kind of leadership and to assert that a new consensus is  emerging. The most useful books describing that process are concerned with  Future Search/ Search Conference methodologies.	1999-12-08

Essentially written as an exposé and an entertainment, with something of the breathless 'gee whiz'  quality that seems to go with the genre.  At the same time, it marshals a  formidable body of facts and opinion in support of its thesis and is  challenging and thought-provoking.  It should certainly give those  connected with business schools some cause for reflection.<br />The main  thesis is that Business Schools have lost their way as educators or  contributors to the art of management, while continuing to run a  profitable, though often inefficient business.  The main beneficiaries are  the alumni who are able to wave the icon of an MBA to attract large  rewards, although there is little evidence that they perform better as  managers than those without the label.  They in turn support the business  schools with contributions, thereby completing a mutually beneficial  reinforcing loop.<br />The authors go into some length on the fallacies of the  case study method, which remains the favoured teaching method.  Among the  critical fallacies are:<br />the fallacy that there is a 'right answer'<br />the  fallacy that the sorts of financial and analytical data typically provided  give an sufficiently complete insight into the dynamics of the issue (the  neglect of the human element)<br />the fallacy that the professor 'knows' and  the student 'learns' (an issue that is discussed at great length and with  great pungency in Vaill: Learning as a Way of Being)<br />the fallacy that  working with a series of case studies has much to do with the critical  skill of preparing for life-long learning (see, among others, Cunningham,  Ian: The Wisdom of Strategic Learning)<br />The authors argue that 'the end  result is that top managers are notably dysfunctional when it comes to  personal skills' and that many are notably poor at learning.  'Despite  Argyris' work and insights, business schools have nurtured a faith in  problem solving.'<br />Interesting and often entertaining though the analysis  is, the most important substance in the book is in the last two chapters,  which look to the future.  The authors argue that the advance of technology  (including the capacity for various forms of distance learning and  electronic integration of learning with work), plus the turbulence that is  forcing business to recognise the centrality of continuous learning and  knowledge acquisition provide two powerful drivers of change.  Business  schools must stop regarding themselves as the sole preserve of knowledge  and learning and must become part of networks of learning.	1999-12-08

Essential reading	A very wide ranging book written by an experienced journalist about the dilemmas created as globalisation transforms the world around our local communities and cultures.  He won two Pulitzer Prizes for his reporting as  bureau chief in Beirut, and it is this background from which the analogy of  the olive tree comes.  He explains how his career has enabled him to slowly  come to see the many different dimensions of globalisation, how they link,  and what we can do about it.  It is a very systemic perspective.  (Thurow,  Lester: Building Wealth is complementary to it.  Korten, David: When  Corporations Rule the World provides a 1995 counterblast. Any of the books  and pamphlets by Robert Theobald and also Harman, W.:  Global Mind Change  provide creative ideas on how globalisation can be redirected to achieve  societal ans well as economic ends.) <br />The book is in four parts.  <br />Part  one explains how to look at the system we call globalisation and how it  works.  <br />Part two is a discussion of how nation-states, communities,  individuals and the environment interact with the system.  <br />Part three is  a good look at the backlash.  <br />Part four is an even better look at the  unique role of the USA in this new world.<br />To understand and convey the  complexity of what is going on, Friedman believes that he had to learn to  combine six dimensions or perspectives in different ways and weights to  understand the systemic interrelationships at play and then tell stories in  order to explain it.  This is what he does in the book.  He also identifies  what he believes to be the key driving forces to globalisation and the  conditions necessary for a society to succeed in a globalised world.<br />As  an analysis of the multiple forces at play and their interaction, The Lexus  and the Olive Tree could hardly be bettered, and the comment that we know  about as much about the globalised world that is emerging as we did about  the Cold War world in 1946 really resonates.<br />I am less satisfied with  Friedman's prescription, which is essentially that rape is inevitable - and  may be pleasurable - so we may as well relax and enjoy it.  That both  under-rates the very real dangers posed by a large group of potential  losers and, more important, absolves us from the need to search creatively  for a third way that places more emphasis on the human spirit and  sustainability and less on money as such.  <br />It is notable how much of the  business literature is beginning to focus on ethics, spiritual values and  moral and ethical obligations.  It is also notable how rapidly the various  movements to reshape the world around more fundamentally human values are  building strength.  The balance is not just, as Friedman seems to suggest,  between globalised progress and separatist stagnation, but other options  need creative development, based on wider values than those that motivate  the 'electronic herd'.<br />The conspiracy theorists claim that global  business is consciously trying to promote the 'inevitability' of a system  that happens to suit them very well.  They would probably claim that  Friedman has fallen into their trap.  Whatever the truth or otherwise of a  'conspiracy', I am left with Russell Ackoff's phrase ringing in my head -  'If we don't work to get the future we want, we will have to learn to live  with the future we get.'  <br />Recognising the strength of the forces that  Friedman describes so well, that is perhaps the issue.  Are we clear about  what kind of world we want and are we prepared to work for it?	1999-12-08

He  insists that the views expressed are his own - and some of them are  distinctly idiosyncratic.  This adds to, rather than detracting from the  quality of the book, because he also discusses other views in considerable  detail.  This helps to make the distinction between his prescription and  those of others, in a field in which the terminology is decidedly 'muddy'.  As an example, 'action learning' can be used to refer to anywhere up to  half a dozen distinct training/learning approaches.<br />Right at the heart of  his concern is learning how to learn.  The specific program content of a  program of learning and the techniques of learning employed are means to  the end of becoming a skilled learner both as an individual and in  relationship with others.  What distinguishes his prescription is a  consistent focus not simply on how well people learn marketing, quality  management or whatever but on how the strategy and processes of learning  combine to meet both immediate learning goals and improve learning  capacity.  He is primarily concerned with what is variously described as  second order learning, 'reframing' or 'metalearning'.<br />Everyone engaged in  organisational change and, in particular, in the difficult shift from a  bureaucratic mind-set will find a great deal to think about.  They will  also encounter both challenges and useful ideas and tools.<br />For those who  have read the first edition, the second edition adds a chapter on the  learner in context, and has maintained and improved the sideline headings  throughout the book. Other changes are relatively minor and certainly do  not changethe thrust of the argument.	1999-12-08

It is very well written and avoids economist's jargon.  Whether  or not you agree with the author's underlying assumptions, the book is  essential reading for anyone concerned with either global business or  national or international policy.  It is a 'must read'.  Readers should  however be aware of the underlying assumptions about the goals of society,  many of which are being challenged.  In effect, Thurow is describing a  particular scenario in which the relationships that he specifies are  dominant.  Other scenarios are equally plausible, in which these  relationships do not hold.<br />Thurow is arguing for a capitalism in which  state or societal intervention is not only acceptable but necessary,  provided that it is directed to supporting growth by correcting the  failures of laissez-faire capitalism and not to direct income  redistribution. The book ends with 'A Salute to the Builders'.  Great  civilisations, says Thurow, are those that have been great builders.  <br />It  is said that there are two roads to happiness.  One is to be content with  what you have, the other is to get what you want - the distinction between  what Daniel Quinn in Ishmael called the 'leavers' and the 'takers'.  Thurow  belongs squarely with the second group.  The 'great debate' developing is  between those who. like Thurow, take it for granted that economic values  encompass all the values that need to be taken into account and those who  regard non-economic values as more important.  They are not necessarily  mutually exclusive, but real effort is needed to reconcile them.  It is not  enough to simply dismiss one set or the other as being 'inferior'.	1999-12-08

Nearly everything in it was  anticipated by the Pinchots in 1993 and the themes covered are very well  established (and were already established when it was first published in  1997).  Although it is not new, the principles are still not widely  followed, so any additional material that may serve to spread the message  is welcome.<br />The material is good.  The reliance on a lot of examples  makes it very discursive, but the sub-heads through the text are useful.  There is a slightly breathless air of 'discovery' through the book that  would be acceptable if the ideas and prescriptions were in fact new.	1999-12-08

It contrasts two scenarios of world development, arguing that we are on a knife edge between sustained growth and a vicious  cycle of over-population.<br />The book is an odd and not wholly persuasive  mix of sophisticated economic data and naive socio-political analysis, with  a solid dash of wishful thinking.  The underlying assumptions  include:<br />Globalisation can be expressed and measured in terms of the  ratio of trade (and merchandise trade at that) to world production;<br />GNP  or GDP are good measures of economic growth and prosperity<br />Given the  right policies, large numbers of people will translate into large and  profitable markets<br />Moves to remove all barriers to trade are an  unqualified good<br />Pursuit of these policies will of itself resolve  problems of environmental degradation.<br />NONE of these assumptions should  be accepted without challenge and the evidence for most of them is quite dreadful, innaccurate, or missing, and blatantly misleading.	1999-12-08

The first two parts of the book make the case, the third outlines a broad philosophy of design and  ways of treating space to meet relationship needs.<br />Most people concerned  with change management do think about physical design issues: this book is  helpful in framing the issues and possible solutions and in highlighting  the linkage between types of activity and relationship and appropriate  physical design.  It is written for the generalist manager or OD specialist  and does not go into architectural detail, but does clearly highlight the  way in which physical space affects culture and performance.  It is easy to  read and has some very wry cartoons scattered through it.	1999-12-07

It is  based on a construct in which there are 'elites', 'middles' and  'immigrants', each with a defined role and each, in a sense, dependent on  the others. They are thrown into a situation which is systemically designed  to throw the interdependencies and tensions into sharp relief.  This is, of  course, a reasonable reflection of the situation ordinarily found inside a  typical organisation, although apparently built in a somewhat stark and  exaggerated form.  The book does not make it clear whether the failure of  participants to challenge and overthrow the entire framework is a product  of the rules, the expectations of the participants or the dynamics of the  system.<br />If you accept the basic framework, the messages that come out of  the experience are useful, but hardly surprising.	1999-12-07

Little of the content is particularly new or surprising and there  are some notable gaps (see below), but the book may be worth getting for  the frameworks, tables, figures and 'instruments' alone.  The authors have  worked hard to produce a book that is thoroughly user friendly without  being simplistic, and they have succeeded well.  It is however, somewhat  'slick' for my taste and it definitely belongs to the world we are leaving  rather than the world to which we are moving.<br />I have three criticisms.  <br />There is a strong whiff of setting up a 'straw man' so that they can  knock it down while building their case.  I do not have any sense that  other writers have unduly neglected results in writing about leadership  attributes and the authors' insistence on that alleged failure gets a bit  tedious.  A related aspect of the same issue is that the author team is at  least as good at marketing gimmickry as it is at building tables and  figures.  &quot;Leadership&quot; and &quot;results&quot; are two words of  known selling power and they are used to the point of distraction.  For  this reader, the resulting 'hard sell' style casts a bit of a shadow over  the authority of the work as a whole and contributes to the excessive  glorification of 'leaders' as the source of all success that seems to be  endemic at present.<br />Much more important is a major gap in the range of  leadership concerns covered.  They devote a chapter to each of four major  groups of stakeholders: employees, the organisation, customers and  investors.  There is no mention at all of society, the community or the  environment as stakeholders, yet any substantial organisation ignores that  very important group of stakeholders at their peril.<br />Similarly there islittle direct mention of other critically important areas for leadership  attention, for example their role in nurturing the supply chain, or in  managing the technologically driven step changes so well described in  Baghai et al: The Alchemy of Growth.  While there is some brief discussion  of alternative processes for developing strategies the essential leadership  role of developing strategic direction is also treated very  cursorily.<br />The third criticism is more subtle.  Concern with results  necessarily means concern with measurement or assessment.  The authors in  general deal quite well with the issue of establishing measures of results  across a range of areas concerning their four chosen groups of stakeholders  and recognise the importance of qualitative as well as quantitative  measures.  I think they should have given more attention to the associated  risk of giving inadequate attention to things that are hard to measure just  because measurement is difficult.  One of the great societal questions at  the moment is how we value things - like the environment and community  harmony - that can not easily be expressed in terms of money.  Defining and  measuring balanced results is getting much harder, not easier, whether at a  societal or an organisational level.  It involves wisdom, not just skill,  and any book that seeks to relate leadership to results should directly  recognise that and directly address it.<br />So what you have is a book that  solves the problems of the 80's and 90's rather than one that addresses the  dominant concerns of the next century.  But within its own framework, the  book does quite a good job.	1999-12-07

Kotter on What Leaders Really Do (Harvard Business Review Book)	Books	3	52	53	N	N	A useful collection of Kotter's articles	Six of Kotter's articles published between 1979 and 1997 are prefaced by a substantial introduction under the title of Leadership at the Turn of the Century.  The six articles are arranged in two groups of three, the first  three grouped under Leadership and Change and the second under the heading  Dependency and Networks.  The first part contains the famous articles  &quot;What Leaders Really Do&quot; and &quot;Leading Change: Why  Transformation Efforts Fail&quot;, which was the article behind the  author's subsequent book &quot;Leading Change&quot;.<br />I seem to be in a  minority in thinking that Kotter's views of leadership are over-rated.   Although his commentary recognises complexity, his prescriptions seem to me  to be instrumental, linear  and unduly inwardly focused.  He takes a very  analytical view of an intensely human art.  One of the central features of  successful leadership is passion, and another is a strong and well  articulated sense of values.  The author recognises both, but does not  appear to be engaged by them.  They appear to be treated as merely two more  ingredients in the mix.  Above all, it does not ask the questions that are  becoming so dominant - questions about societal values, about balancing the  need for profit with issues of sustainability and even about the role of  the corporation in a globalised world.<br />Having said that, there is a lot  of good material available.  His '8 steps' are sufficiently well known not  to need repetition, and the article &quot;What Leaders Really Do&quot; is a  good summary of the distinction between leadership and management concerns.  <br />The introduction is written largely around ten 'observations', which add  up to saying that leadership and management are different, that high  complexity and high rates of change make leadership increasingly important,  with a large part of the leadership role being concerned with building  vision, providing inspiration and building networks of relationship.	1999-12-07

The book is in eight parts.  The first sets out an overview and the methodology.  The remaining seven parts cover the seven  identified steps:<br />Planning initiatives<br />Exploring strategic  implications<br />Analyzing costs/performance<br />Selecting  providers<br />Negotiating terms<br />Transitioning resources<br />Managing  relationships<br />As you would expect of a book that is set up as a manual,  there are plenty of tables, check lists and examples included to illustrate  each process and sub-process.<br />'Outsourcing ... becomes strategic when it  is aligned with the organisation's long-term strategies, and when the  typical outsourcing benefits will emerge over several years, and when the  results, either positive or negative, will be significant to the  organization.'<br />While this definition and the subsequent detail  distinguishes 'strategic' outsourcing from tactical moves driven simply by  cost-cutting or problem solving, it is still a fairly long way from Doz and  Hamel's definition of strategic alliances in terms of the 'race for the  future' (technology) and 'race for the world' (globalisation).  Outsourcing  implies that the outsourcer is in control - this is not an equal  partnership - even though the distinction from an alliance becomes somewhat  blurred in the series of boxes throughout the text that go beyond  traditional reasons for outsourcing to provide &quot;Another Reason to  Outsource&quot;.  These wider reasons are mentioned, but there is little  discussion of the relative advantages of outsourcing compared with other  sorts of partnering arrangements.<br />Compare with Lendrum, Tony: The  Strategic Partnering Handbook	1999-12-07

Written by a leading expert on organisational  culture. It is of interest both to students of organisational culture and  for its relevance to globalisation.<br />Two groups of readers who will be  interested in this 1997 study of Singapore's Economic Development Board  (EDB).  T EDB has been Singapore's chosen instrument for development and  implementation of its policies to become a very successful player in a  globalised world.  Its strategies and practices are of more than passing  interest to anyone interested in dealing successfully with globalisation.  Both the discussion of the factors in the EDB's success and the discussion  of the problems and issues that it - and by extension Singapore - faces  make an extremely illuminating case study that, by virtue of EDB's role,  incorporates national, governmental and enterprise perspectives. The book  also makes an interesting case study of other criteria for successful  globalisation identified by both Thurow: Building Wealth and Friedman: The  Lexus and the Olive Tree.<br />Second, students of organisational culture are  offered a thorough and lucid account of how the person who is arguably the  world's foremost authority on organisational culture went about studying a  major organisation in the context of a wider societal culture with which he  was not wholly familiar.	1999-12-07

Indeed, the authors insist that it is neither possible nor desirable to set out a prescriptive approach to build a learning organisation.  The book relies  heavily on extended case studies and includes substantial biographical  detail on the leaders and key facilitators in the selected cases, as well  as extended invited contributions by four of them.  These case studies are  used to illustrate the main shared features that the authors have observed  in successful transformation to an organisation that is able to learn as  part of its continuing functioning.  Key features on which they focus  include the use of 'action technologies' (action research, action learning  and action science), a systemic view of change and an emphasis on the power  of partnership between HR professionals and line managers.<br />The three  'action technologies' that lie at the heart of their preferred  methodologies are jargon terms for:  ß a research and design methodology  that iterates from diagnosis through vision building and alignment to  experiments and reassessment ß action learning using a number of devices to  integrate learning and work, and  ß the use of the techniques of skilled  conversation and group learning to identify and resolve issues - the  process of cycling between action and reflection and the principles  involved in 'double loop learning' The conclusions are unsurprising, but it  is useful to see them reinforced.<br />The authors do a service in reminding  us that, while there are universal underlying principles, the move towards  a learning organisation is an exploration and its steps can not be  codified.  Those who like to learn through case studies will find the book  useful and practising facilitators will probably find it useful to 'compare  notes' with those quoted in the book.  However, it certainly does not  replace any of my established favourites in this field.	1999-12-07

The formation of effective strategic alliances lies at the heart of success as a global  organisation or in dealing with global majors, and this book provides a  great deal of the 'why' and 'how' of building and maintaining robust and  mutually beneficial partnerships and alliances.<br />In addition, careful  reading will provide valuable insights into the nature of competition in  today's global market economy (which is vastly different from the  underlying market economy theory that still informs much national economic  policy).  Indeed, it goes to the heart of the practicalities of achieving  success in globalisation.  It provides equally valuable insights into the  nature of leadership in a world of networks, skills that are different in  kind from those covered by more traditional authors such as Ulrich in his  recent Results-Based Leadership.<br />The sub-title is The Art of Creating  Value through Partnering, and I am sure that the word 'Art' was chosen very  deliberately.  Partnering decisions are among the most important strategic  decisions and organisation can make, and the authors, while offering  invaluable tools to assist the decision process, make it very clear that  this can be no simple 'tick a box' exercise.  They place culture, personal  attitudes, vision and motivation and learning at the centre of the  preconditions for success.<br />It is an essentially strategic book, written  by two leading strategic thinkers, that also reaches down to the nuts and  bolts of working through the why, what and how of successful and enduring  partnerships and networks of partnership.	1999-12-07

It purports to be about the distinction between a 'make-and-sell'  organisation and a 'sense-and-respond' organisation. The first  is  production efficiency focused and second is focused on customer  satisfaction.   (What the author calls 'sense-and-respond' is in fact an  unacknowledged version of the Kolb cycle or cycle of organisational  learning cycle, so well examined by Nancy Dixon.  It is essential to all  forms of learning, whether that is applied to providing customer  satisfaction or to playing a musical instrument)<br />Overtly he argues that  the shift from a make-and-sell orientation to a sense-and-respond  orientation is a major piece of unfinished business for organisations.  The  reason that he can argue this is that he 'bundles' the issue of customer  responsiveness with the much wider issue of complexity and unpredictability  in the environment - in other words, he argues that it is not possible to  be truly customer responsive if you do not also recognise complexity in  markets.  <br />Beneath this surface argument that the new complexity requires  new approaches and its characterisation as a move to 'sense-and-respond',  lies the real issue, which is the defence of command-and-control from  devolution of control, which the author characterises dismissively as  'communicate-and-hope'.  The author develops a framework which is designed  to retain the essential features of command-and -control, while building  flexibility and responsiveness.  He argues that forms of governance that  challenge command-and-control have only been effective in smaller and  simpler organisations than the giants with which he is primarily concerned.   By extension, he argues that they can not work in such  organisations.<br />The core of his prescription isthe ability of central  management to provide central direction to the organisation by the use of  an analogy to 'fly by wire' technology.  In other words, he advocates the  use of modern technology to keep central management informed of  unpredictable change so fast that they can respond appropriately within  tight time deadlines.  When a 'modular' approach to structuring  organisations is added,  he argues that they can respond effectively not  only to the generality of customers but to particular customers.  However,  the question of relationships with internal stakeholders - employees - does  not figure in his schematic, nor does the issue of external alliances and  partnerships.  Both (separately and together) challenge the capacity of  command and control: it is not just customers and markets.	1999-12-06

It is concerned specifically with the transition between leaders, whether to an anointed internal  successor or to an outsider.  The coverage of both the issues and suggested  solutions is thorough, systematic and clear and is based on extensive  conversations with people in the situation of taking up a senior leadership  role.  It is also relatively unsurprising.  My only - minor - criticism is  that the book is unnecessarily long, largely because it includes a great  deal of material that is common to all stages and situations of leadership  rather than sticking to the specifics of the transition situation.	1999-12-06
