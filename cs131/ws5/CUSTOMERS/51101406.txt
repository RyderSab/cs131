Recently I purchased another copy, because I thought perhaps my tastes would have changed, and I had also recently purchased Cunningham's incense book and liked it. Now I remember why I gave this one away.<br /><br />I do like the fact that the book has an encyclopedic aspect with drawings of the herbs, elements, gender, planetary aspects. I like Cunningham's intro chapters to the material as well. But the main problem I have with this book is a problem I have with several of Cunningham's books of this type (\\"Magical Household\\" comes to mind) is that it's big on folklore and superstitious uses of plants and herbs. Another reviewer mentioned that noting the actual magical effectiveness of herbs would have been nice. I totally agree. At least distinguishing which is folklore/old wives tales and which are classically magical would have been nice. I read an article once which I believe was written by Cunningham's former roommate Donald Michael Kraig, who stressed how much research Cunningham did in writing this book,  including brewing up herbal mixtures, testing, etc. If that were the case, I really don't see the practical result here, which is too bad. When looking through it, what I see most is folklore, which may or may not help you. To me, it seems a little lightweight and not as practical as it could be.<br /><br />Also, he doesn't touch upon any sort of herbal medicine/healing information. I realize this is covered in any number of books on herbalism, but, to me, that is part of the \\"Magick\\" of herbs. A little bit of info along these lines would have been more useful to me than wearing an herb to ward off gunshots or scorpions, or putting something under your pillow to make your dreams come true.<br /><br />Cunningham has millions of fans who will probably disagree with me and that's just fine.  I don't feel I'm bashing this book, because it does has some useful information. But if you are on the fence about purchasing this, I highly recommend reading through a copy in your local bookstore before purchasing outright. The intro chapter is all that's shown in the \\"Look inside the book\\" feature here on Amazon, and I don't think that always gives an accurate feel.his book, because it does has some useful information.

Dr. Taverner, assisted by the young Dr. Rhodes, runs a nursing home in which patients suffer from a variety of \\"psychological\\" disturbances which are all psychic in nature. Very much a Sherlock Holmes bent, as Dr. Taverner, being an adept of an occult order, is able to hone in and cure these various problems using unconventional means.<br /><br />I found the stories to be interesting reading in and of themselves, but according to Dion Fortune, they were all based on actual events that she witnessed in her early occult training. Supposedly, \\"Dr. Taverner\\" is based on one of her mentors, while \\"Dr. Rhodes\\" is based on herself. So, read with this in mind, it is doubly fascinating.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the stories from the context of being written not terribly long after World War I, and many references are made to that event, with one story in particular, \\"Blood-Lust\\" telling of events occurring as a result of the war. In her book,\\"Psychic Self Defense,\\" Fortune goes into more detail about this particular event, which indeed was toned down somewhat for the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone looking for an intro to Dion Fortune's fiction.	2005-07-17

What interested me about this book was the concept of making self burning incense, although I had pretty much discontinued that type due to many of them having a rather artificial/chemical smell. Carl Neal gives you plenty of detailed information about making all-natural self burning types...cones, sticks and other forms. In fact, that is the main focus of this book which makes it unique among other incense books I've checked out. Not that there's anything wrong with blending resins and herbs and using charcoal, but I was very fascinated with the idea of making cones, etc. My first experiments so far have turned out really well, and I am very impressed. This is not \\"incense making made difficult\\" as another reviewer stated. I made two batches of different types and molded them into cones in less than a half hour. It is a nice feeling to know *exactly* what is in your incense!<br /><br />I should also add that this is a very user friendly and easy to read book. I love Carl Neal's writing style, which is very conversational and down to earth, just like a regular guy explaining what he does. He explains everything thoroughly, such as what tools, conventional and unconventional, that he uses, other tricks about the drying process and so on. There are plenty of recipes, a detailed troubleshooting guide, ingredients chart with elemental and traditional associations and so on. He explains the Japanese concept of incense very well. I also liked the \\"Advanced Incense Philosophies\\" in which he discusses the ethical use of various ingredients. All in all, I would highly recommend this book.	2005-07-12

Bean Guide to Outdoor Photography	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A wonderful book...great for beginners	I recently acquired an older SLR camera and picked up this book because of my interest in outdoor photography. I had very little experience with a manual camera, so the fact that this book was a little older appealed to me (most of the newer books seem to focus mainly on the digital medium) This book is really amazing, and it's a shame that it's out of print. Lefty Kreh is best known for fly fishing, but this book displays his talent for teaching photography, too. Not only does he give great advice for shooting outdoor photos, but the book is jam packed with info relating to practically every aspect of photography which previously befuddled me. I have several other \\"beginner\\" books, but this one really clarified many things for me regarding lens aperture, varying lens types, light metering, etc. There are many pages of \\"before and after\\" photos showing the effects of different lenses, filters, lighting and composition which are extremely helpful. Plenty of great info also on \\"people pictures,\\" i.e. portraits (some candid, some not). Kreh speaks in a very \\"conversational\\" way which doesn't go over your head. Rather than explaining things in an extremely scientific way, he gives real examples that give you that \\"Aha!\\" feeling once you understand WHY.<br />Of course, if you are looking for outdoor photography from a digital perspective, you aren't going to find it here (copyright 1988). But, I am loving my \\"old school\\" Pentax ME and looking forward to getting the maximum out of it!	2005-05-29

They are fantastic. I've also read the other  Abraham-Hicks  books, subscribed to the monthly tapes and read voraciously on the A-H website. So, when this new book came out I purchased it. I must say I was slightly disappointed. For those new to the Abraham materials, it's great, but personally I felt like I had already read this book. Much of it has been covered in various other mediums put out by the Hicks. Which is not to say it's a bad book...just for me personally it felt diluted. It is nice to have the emotional setpoint info and things placed in some sort of order. And, I can easily see how someone completely new to Abraham would find this book life-changing. I will say that this is somewhat more \\"reader friendly\\" than the other A-H books, which makes it more appealing for mass consumption. So, at least others out there are getting this info and perhaps putting it to great use to better their lives...which is great. However, I would suggest that if you are already very familiar with the Abe materials to take a good look through before purchasing....you may want to pass, or you may want to buy to have it all in one place. I would still recommend that those new to this check out the other books and website, just to give a more comprehensive view.	2005-04-11

Other reviewers echo my feelings here. However, a couple of things about this particular book could be improved upon. Firstly, the others in this series that I've read by Malloy have maps of the individual campgrounds after each review, which I find to be very helpful in orienting myself, particularly when he recommends certain sites. For some odd reason, this book does not. Secondly, I was unhappy with the amount of material lifted verbatim from his \\"Best of Tent Camping: The Carolinas.\\" I already own that book, and found that all of the reviews for campgrounds in North and South Carolina were identical in both. I understand that perhaps a lot of new material might not be available to add to/improve upon the descriptions. But had I known this, I might have just purchased his guide to Tennessee and Kentucky instead, since they probably would have overlapped and covered everything in this volume, plus more (with the exception of a few in Georgia). That said, I would still highly recommend this book if you aren't planning on purchasing others in the series covering the same areas.	2005-03-26

You will find old favorites here that perhaps you haven't tasted in a while. Try the chocolate pie with meringue...takes me back to my childhood. Somewhat time consuming, but SO MUCH tastier than instant pudding in a graham cracker shell. Rhubarb pie, another you don't see very often, takes me back to Grandma's kitchen.

Fist of all, skimming through this book is really a trip...I love the sort of &quot;70's hippie layout&quot; and hope they never change this!<br />As far as content, I have to echo others...a great book, chock full of great, simple recipes!  My version is a little older, but I think that little has been changed over the years. It's a bit of a time capsule. It's just a wealth of great, basic vegetarian info. How to make your own tofu, tempeh, etc. In fact, you can still buy tempeh starter from the Mail Order Catalog (based at the Farm), follow the recipe here and you can't go wrong.<br />Most of the recipes are for family friendly, down home kinds of meals, just adapted to the veggie palate. One really gets the impression that many of  the Farm folks, having presumably grown up on a sort of 50's homestyle cooking, reworked a lot of this into real family-type, comfort foods. My personal favorite recipe is the Soft Sandwich buns!<br />Speaking of family, there is a great deal of info here about vegetarian nutrition for pregnant and nursing women, and children.<br />The Farm has been around for decades, and is still going...they must be doing something right!	2004-06-18

I agree with other reviewers that this is a nicely illustrated book with plenty of recipes for those who are new to tofu. The recipes I have tried have been mostly quite tasty (I especially liked the Enchiladas and Barbecued Tofu). However, many of the recipes are very time consuming and/or require frozen tofu, which you may or may not have on hand when thinking about what to make for supper. I like to experiment with these kinds of meals once in a while, but  for the most part, I prefer things to go relatively quickly. Nothing worse than spending a lot of time on a recipe (the To-fu Yung one in this book comes to mind) only to have it turn out so-so. Nonetheless, I do think it's a valuable book to those looking for new ways to prepare tofu.	2004-06-16

I stumbled across Ms. Peril's website once, relieved that I am not the only person in the world who collects old home-ec and charm books :-) I got this out of the library, not expecting this book to be as exhaustive as it was, really thinking it might be more of a pictoral &quot;poking fun of the kitschy 50's&quot;  type of book which I've seen now and then. However, I was delighted to find that Ms. Peril does a fantastic job exploring the mores of the past. Funny, scary, unbelievable.  I would have to agree with another reviewer here, though, that present day &quot;pink think&quot; is only briefly touched upon. This is fine with me, because I look upon this as more of a historical perspective of the 20th century through the 70's.  Nonetheless, I found it fascinating and hard to put down.	2004-02-16

I have only discovered Art Bell within the last year or so, unfortunately (wish I had started listening earlier). But I felt compelled to learn more about this fascinating guy.<br />I have to echo what others have said in that the book isn't edited well, although an editor *claims* in the intro to have worked on this with Bell. If so, I'd have to say she didn't do a very good job of it. The book is written in sort of category-like chapters...sort of an outline of his life and its events. It doesn't flow well. I found it was better just to pick up and start reading anywhere. Things backtrack, repeat themselves, so in reading this way you sort of got the full gist. It seems like Bell just sat down at a computer and started writing, sort of chronologically but not always. I wonder if the editor (supposedly one of his fans) was perhaps intimidated or awed and didn't want to change much? I really don't have any other explanation.<br />On the other hand, although the writing style wasn't polished,  I found this to be rather a good thing at times as it was more conversational and you certainly did feel like you were talking to the man. Art seems to be mostly a simple guy, not into glitz and glamour, so it seemed more &quot;real&quot; and closer to the truth.<br />Warning...if you are not an Art Bell fan, I'm sure you will be disappointed. Although there is information about talk radio, the bulk of the book is stuff about his life.  Which is basically what I wanted to read about anyway.<br />I would like to see an updated version, since things have changed drastically with Coast To Coast, etc., since this has come out.	2004-02-10

Though the couple was steeped in the tradition of  the Aurum Solis, and many of the exercises in this book (and others) are borrowed from that tradition, everything is pretty straightforward and *accessible*. The writing style is down to earth. I can't quite place my finger on what it is that I enjoy about the writing style of D & P, except that they are earthy, not pompous and almost parental in their guidance. Years ago, I found this book and since that time I have lent it out or given it to several people... something I just don't ordinarily do. The exercises are simple, little or no ritualism and, (again, that word) \\"accessible\\" for the average person.  I'm confused by another reviewer who  felt the \\"tower of light\\" exercise was complicated or suitable for \\"adepts only\\"...I felt exactly the opposite. As other reviewers have mentioned, many topics are covered in this book, including psychic vampirism, negative group energies, even advertising pressures. Read this along with Denning & Phillips \\"Creative Visualization\\"...they work well together. Overall, highly recommended!	2003-12-02

OK, Lynn Grabhorn's writing style may be a little annoying, but the basic gist of this is that the energy that you put out/vibrate attracts your life experiences. Life is about choosing to feel good.

Then, if you are wanting something more &quot;deep&quot; regarding the concept of reality creation...check out the Jane Roberts/Seth materials. Personally I find the Abraham-Hicks material is just fine for me!<br />The bottom line is 1) it works and 2) not everyone is ready for this concept.  With regard to the reviewer who questioned why children have bad life experiences...if you accept the concept that is put out here and by the Abraham materials that we choose our life experience before we are born, and that children are influenced by the energies around them, you may see how this happens. When you look around and begin to realize just how many of us are &quot;flatlining&quot; or putting out zero good energy, you start to realize how pervasive this mindset is. You can be a &quot;good/nice&quot; person and still vibrate fear, negativity and other low frequency energies and attract &quot;bad things.&quot;<br />Far from being scary, these concepts are actually kind of freeing as you realize that you are part of God, that you are not some puppet whose strings are being pulled by some outside force, etc.<br />I have not read her second book, &quot;Dear God!&quot; which has been likened as the &quot;depressive&quot; part of a manic/depressive episode (this book being the manic) and I have no intention of doing so.

I was anticipating receiving this book, as I enjoy vegetarian food and don't mind meat substitutes, but was disappointed to find that almost all of the recipes call for &quot;prepared&quot; Asian meat substitutes (vegetarian cuttlefish, dried gluten balls etc.) that are nearly *impossible* to find, even online, it seems. Perhaps if one lived in a city that has a *large* Asian population and well stocked groceries, it wouldn't be a problem. I cook Asian and ethnic foods quite a bit, and my local Asian grocery is quite good, but I've never encountered any of these. Perhaps some could be substituted with TVP or similar, but the descriptions of the meat subs are so vague (&quot;vegetarian meat,&quot; &quot;vegetarian meat chunks&quot; with corresponding pictures that really don't resemble anything I've ever seen before) that I would be afraid to try. I am familiar with the Wei Chuan cook books and realize that most already assume that you know something about what you're doing, but this one is particularly vague. So, I would really skip this book unless you have access to these unusual items (which frankly, sound very good and I would like to try!)	2003-05-18

It made a huge impression on me and has become one of my favorite children's books of all time. 12 year old Kevin and his 10 year old sister Christy, along with their mother, go to a seaside cottage in Oregon to spend a summer holiday. On their first afternoon there, they meet a girl named Mora, who tells them the cove next to theirs is haunted, and that a mysterious witch (who lives in a mansion in the cove next door) goes out on a rock in the middle of the sea to play her flute each night at sunset. Mora further impresses them when she tells them she, herself, has been studying witchcraft. The book follows their adventures in observing the witch, trying to find out how and why she goes out onto the rock, and why the cove is haunted. This book had such great fuel for my imagination as a kid. The supernatural elements are there, but not overpowering, and the ending has a rather earthly conclusion, although we are left with the feeling that Mora does, indeed, have some magical powers. My only criticism is that Christy and Kevin seem to talk and act much older than their years, but this did not really strike me as odd the first time I read it. I just don't think they make very many children's books like this anymore, which don't dumb down dialogue for children. This is a wonderful author, and I still own my hard back copy after 24 years.	2002-04-13

It is written in a very comfortable, casual style and makes you feel as if Linda is really sharing her family recipes. The recipes themselves are unpretentious, and tasty! (I highly recommend the Shepherd's Pie!) The book is written from a lacto-ovo veg perspective, and uses a lot of meat substitutes. Mainstream families would easily be able to incorporate these into a &quot;less meat&quot; lifestyle, or transitioning into vegetarianism. One note, it has a very &quot;British&quot; feel, so you have to keep in mind that &quot;vegetarian mince&quot; is hamburger substitute, etc, other British terms. Also, since she DOES use a lot of meat substitutes, you have to keep an eye on whether she is using TVP, frozen vegetarian ground beef, etc., and also the proportions of the frozen/dried meat analogs. But don't let this put you off. It is easy to catch on. The photos are lovely and mouth watering, too. It is such a great book, and makes me sad that Linda left us so early in her life. May she rest in peace.	2002-02-27

I guess I wanted the &quot;original&quot; rather than &quot;new and improved&quot; version. But upon reviewing it, I found that it was just not very readable and very dated. Yes, it is, for the most part a reference book. Yes, I have the spiral bound edition, which is inferior quality. But even if I owned the hardcover version, the majority of these recipes DO NOT appeal to me. They are interesting to read, as they remind me of some of the vintage cookbooks I have. I have also found some good recipes, such as rosettes and press cookies, that are difficult to find elsewhere. But upon flipping through, I see that many of the recipes are heavy, 50's fare...or &quot;variety meats&quot; (I'm sorry, but I personally find the idea of eating brains, blood or other oddities pretty repugnant)...or just way too time consuming. While interesting to know, I really don't see myself skinning a possum or other wild animal any time soon.<br />For these reasons and more, this book just isn't practical for me. I really think this original version is geared toward the 50's housewife who had all day to prepare a meal. If I have a yen for something, more often than not I can find an easy version in my Better Homes and Gardens cookbook that tastes grand. I have not looked at the &quot;new version&quot; of Joy, so I can only hope it is an improvement. Get this for the novelty factor only. As a final note, if you want to try your hand at all kinds of 50's cocktails...there are pages and pages of this, too!	2001-11-28

I found this book under its old title &quot;Lite and Luscious Indian Cuisine&quot; at the library. I am hoping that only the title has changed, because it's a great book! Ms. Gadia writes in a very conversational way... I feel as though she comes through as a &quot;real person&quot; rather than just an &quot;author&quot;...the recipes are really down to earth as is her writing style. Not many esoteric ingredients are called for (I have a problem sometimes with pantry overload from Indian/Asian cooking...I probably have more kinds of spices in my cupboard than the average Indian person!). It bothers me at times in certain cookbooks when a recipe calls for half a teaspoon of a particular hard to find spice, then doesn't call for that ingredient again in the rest of the book. One ends up with a real overload of spices if you are not cooking Indian every day (especially if you are not cooking for a large family to begin with). In this book some ingredients might be specialized, (asafetida, cardamom pods, etc.) but most of the recipes seem to utilize what is available on hand in your average town (Ms. Gadia lives and works in Ames, Iowa...not New York or Chicago). Those who are on specialized diets will appreciate her tables for food exchanges and nutritional info, too. All around, this seems truly to be &quot;home cooking&quot; and a labor of love!	2001-10-29

From the fascinating description of her sister's wedding that another reviewer mentioned, Sahni goes on for 120 pages giving the basics of Indian vegetarian cooking...then on to the extensive recipes. My favorite so far has been gobhi masallam (stuffed cauliflower with tart tomato-coriander sauce). Even my husband who is dubious about cauliflower loved it! A sign for me that I must purchase a book is contining to check it out of the library for long periods of time...which I have and must get my own copy soon.<br />This book plus her earlier volume &quot;Classic Indian Cooking&quot; make an excellent pair. Both have plenty of information but do not repeat each other much.	2001-09-23
US	51101406	R3QG7FUTN7RCEK	0553149601	230149071	Night Stalks the Mansion	Books	4	0	0	N	N	good book, more interested in the historical info...	I found this an intriguing book, written in the 70s about events taking place presumably in the late 40s early 50s. The title is a bit \\"melodramatic\\"...(sounds more like a gothic romance novel)..but the story itself is interesting. I found myself not so much taken by the \\"ghost story\\" as the events themselves...50 odd years ago this family was able to lease a mansion for $3600 a year... 17 miles outside of Philadelphia complete with original furnishings and virtually unchanged for many years...surrounded by farms and fields. I am not familiar with exactly where this area was, but I can only imagine what kind of development has overtaken it today. I find myself wondering what became of the \\"underground tomb\\" that the author and his son found at the edge of a field. In short,the book's overwhelming impression to me is not so much the ghost story (although it's interesting) as the situation in which the family was involved to let events play out. The author's wife irritated me as she was seemingly more concerned with the dust and dirt the old house generated (typical 50's) than the surroundings themselves. Many pages of how the wife needed a housekeeper to help her keep the house \\"spotless\\" and how these employees wouldn't stay (yawn). I couldn't help thinking what I wouldn't give to have experienced the place as these people did! So I give it 4 stars for storyline, but probably 4.5 for atmosphere. Like the other reviewer I thought it would be interesting to check out the area,  but I thought surely the place had been torn down long ago to make way for suburbia. My sister near Media, but it seems the actual location is unknown.	2001-09-08

If you purchase this book, be aware that is was published under another name, &quot;Singer Sewing Step by Step&quot; in the early 90's. I'm glad that I checked it out of the library before purchasing, because I already own the other book...yes, it has some decent photos, but I would be cautious in recommending this to a beginner, as I was when I purchased the older version. Construction techniques are not thoroughly explained, usually only one or two pages of photos are devoted to any one technique (collars, sleeves, etc.). Personally, I was very frustrated by this. One would be better off using this as a complement to another book, such as the Readers Digest guide to sewing or the Vogue sewing book, both of which are excellent resources but lacking in photo illustrations. The book is a bit dated, too, but if you can get past that, it is not too bad.	2001-07-08

I absolutely loved it. Even then it impressed me how the careless humans were polluting the world, and only Barbapapa and his family were able to help. Great visuals, lovely characters. I wish this book were still in print, it would still be very relevant today. This was probably the first &quot;kid friendly&quot; book I'd ever encountered which discussed pollution in terms I could relate to. I would love to see a resurgence of Barbapapa books, toys, etc., as we have seen with Curious George, etc.	2001-07-05

The clear drawings make identification easy...no confusing photos with distracting backgrounds to wade through...just find your bird and go. The maps are a great help, it is organized very efficiently. My copy is probably 20 years old...I've tried others, but go back to this every time for its ease of use. Others may have more pizazz on the surface, but trust me, this is all you really need!	2001-02-14

I had heard great things about this book, but decided to check it out of the library first. I'm glad I did. First, I must say that many of her freezing hints and such are good, but this is only a short part of the whole. Most of the book is filled with the recipes, many heavy on meat and cheese and low on vegetables. Furthermore, the same recipes were printed throughout the book in different serving proportions, which I thought was a waste of space. In fact, the book itself could have been half its size and still contained all the necessary information...the type seemed large, the recipes spaced out one to a page. Perhaps it was meant to be &quot;easy on the eyes,&quot; I don't know, but the effect was that the author or publisher was trying to &quot;beef up&quot; the text (no pun intended) and make a thicker (read: more expensive) book. But I give it 2.5-3 stars, only because the idea was good. I am hoping that her &quot;lite&quot; version of the book is a little healthier than this.	2001-01-29

Instead, it makes you *think* about our culture's wasteful habits and gives practical suggestions on how we as individuals, families, groups or communities can do &quot;more with less.&quot; Yes, this book is written from a Christian (Mennonite) standpoint, and some people may be put off by that. Though I am not a churchgoer, I found that I was not, and found many of the biblical references to be universal and thought provoking. Firsthand stories from MCC missionaries about life in other cultures were pretty amazing. I feel like sending this to every church I know of in hopes that perhaps someone recognizes the waste/extravagance in many churches themselves! Some passeages in the book  pointed this out and reminded me of &quot;church functions&quot; I've seen in which styrofoam cups and plates were used liberally, piled high with processed foods and artificially colored jello salads! A  new trend I'm seeing involves churches and other groups promoting organizations in which corporate food companies give a handout of processed and non nutritious foods to hungry families in the US without teaching them better cooking habits or nutrition for growing children. Again, maybe flipping through this book might open their eyes, as it's written from a Christian standpoint instead of what they might perceive as an &quot;environmental activist.&quot; Though this book is 20 years old, I find that most of the messages are still holding water. How sad that the author, fighting cancer while writing this, passed away before the book was completed, leaving a husband and two young daughters. One wonders what more she would have done/written had she lived.	2000-12-03

I picked this up at the library one day, being in a Christmas mood and after years of watching The Walton's &quot;Homecoming&quot; Christmas special and loving it. The story is quite different fromt the TV movie, somewhat more bleak in tone...Olivia here is worrying that her husband's delay in coming home is because he is off drinking somewhere instead of hurt in a bus accident. Probably a bit more accurate feel of the Depression here. Still very absorbing and touching, the characters are no less lovable. A nice short read for a rainy day.	2000-11-20

Based on the marvelous film of the same title, this book is a must for those who've seen the movie, whether the long or short version. Beyond filling in the gaps of the background and true personality of Sergeant Howie, it is, quite simply, a great read! Rather than a novelization of exact dialogue and events, this gives a more complete picture of Howie and Summerisle, why he feels so adamant about his Christianity and the need to mission to the &quot;poor pagans.&quot; Unfortunately out of print in the US (I purchased my copy used), it was available from Amazon UK last time I checked.	2000-10-07

This truly is the vegetarian &quot;Joy of Cooking.&quot; Wonderful  recipes, most using simple ingredients, but the final product is often  unusual and always tasty.

Some  may be concerned that many recipes contain cheese and dairy, but this isn't  a problem for me. Wonderful book, I've only had it about a year and already  showing serious signs of wear and tear!	2000-08-25

I first saw Amy D on Donahue in the early 90's and thought, what a crazy lady! A few years later I found Tightwad Gazette #3 and was hooked.<br /><br />As you may have deduced, the information here is based on both Amy's experience with what she calls \\"black belt frugality\\" in her own life, and suggestions sent in from readers of her newsletter from the late 80's - early 90's.<br /><br />Many reviewers here are critical of the way Amy raised her children or snobby about suggestions such as thrift store clothes or dumpster diving. Folks, the material is presented in such a way that you can CHOOSE certain strategies, and ignore others. Nowhere does Amy insist that her way is the only right way. I consider this book to be a springboard for your OWN ideas. There are so many things in this book that I have unconsciously absorbed in my life. Cost Per Wow (CPW) is the one that comes to mind first, but learning to think outside the box, making your own recipes, the Pantry Principle...all these things have just become part of my life.<br /><br />I agree that this book is in serious need of updating. However, it's doubtful this will ever happen, as Amy has retired and, from what I have heard, has no interest in revisiting this as she has moved on with life (put into practice what she had envisioned).<br /><br />This book (or should I say compilation of three books) has become the touchstone for a whole industry of \\"frugal\\" books out there. Many books I've perused on saving money over the years borrow heavily or take ideast STRAIGHT from this book. Save yourself the bother of reading all those and buy this instead. Practice selective reading, discard what is not useful to you but don't discard the whole book. It's a wonderful resource, and I would highly recommend.	2000-07-30

While this book is acceptable, like other reviewers I found it a bit over-emotional and feel Amy Dacyzycn's tightwad books are MUCH better. This reads a bit like a Heloise book, lots of scattered tips, some are good,  some are obvious. Half the book is spent talking about credit cards. Yes,  credit cards can be evil, but it all depends on the person using them.  Overall, I was not very impressed with this book, and I'm glad I got it out  of the library.	2000-07-30

Books	4	49	51	N	N	Good for small offices	I received an autographed copy of this book from Don Aslett a couple years ago after writing to him in praise of his &quot;Clutter&quot; series of books. So huzzah to Don! :-) I found this book, like his others, to be  entertaining and eye opening. The only reason for four stars is that it  seems geared toward a smaller office, where the decision to pitch files and  streamline may be handled a little more easily. I think more space might  have been devoted to how to deal with &quot;bureaucratic&quot; offices such  as mine, where useless stuff must be &quot;archived&quot; with the okay of  the higher ups. So much stuff I would love to pitch in the trash can, but  can't, due to red tape. So someone who has full control of what stays, what  goes, might glean more useful advise from this. I particularly enjoyed his  office &quot;types&quot; list...Homefront Hannah, etc. I think everyone can  identify with these.	2000-07-29

I do empathize with Kennealy, and do feel that Pam and Jim's relationship (especially with the help of Oliver Stone) was blown out of proportion. I also find it completely plausible  that Jim would be drawn to someone with Kennealy's intelligence and pagan  beliefs (like it or not, she is a genius...and like Jim, very mystical). It  is interesting to note that Pamela's family does own some (most?) of the  rights to Morrison's &quot;persona,&quot; and Oliver Stone basically took  the movie from the &quot;Pam angle,&quot; presumably not to offend the  Coursons and interfere with the film's production. (Kennealy did get  screwed as far as the movie was concerned, no doubt about that). Was the  book a gloss over? Perhaps, but I did find it pretty believable. My main  problem with her book is that it IS egocentric and more that a little  pompous, plus it is so obvious that Kennealy STILL has so much anger and  pain inside her. She seems so bitter that it is hard to believe she can  exist from day to day carrying this around. I found myself wondering WHY  she feels the need to constantly relive the whole issue and defend herself.  It is difficult to plod through this again and again through the book, she  reminds me of a cornered animal screaming and biting at everyone, demanding  that she is right and everyone else is wrong.  I feel for her pain, but  it's time to LET GO. It's now gotten to the point where she is disturbingly  obsessive in proclaiming her recollections of the relationship with  Morrison to the world (i.e. her website) and frankly, she's beginning to  look a bit ridiculous and hard to believe anymore. Let the past go and  live!	2000-06-02
