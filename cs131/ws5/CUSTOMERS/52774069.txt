Several things come to mind:<br />1)  Without any spoilers, the ending was awful.  It's as if the author thought, &quot;it's time to end now.&quot;, scribbled some twaddle, and called his publisher.<BR>2)  The characters were banal.  There's the too-trusting, team-playing male and the quietly-suffering, outsider female.  Wow, no way we could've seen that coming.<BR>3)  The section on the court martial was poorly done and should've been deleted.<br />Maybe the author'll get lucky and they'll cast Ben and JLo for the movie.<br />As an irrelevant aside, I grin at the author's obvious worry that he perceives military officers as outside the mainstream (actually, it'd be more accurate to say they're outside his chardonnay-sipping, gallery-opening attending, Bryn Mawr and Wellesley-supporting mainstream).  Since I'd bet dollars to donuts he'd prefer his kids were rabid PETA members than commissioned officers, all I can say is DUH.	2003-08-25

I enjoyed the game he played with his Iranian friend as well as the discussion of his friend's missing drawers.  Tho' I've one minor quibble, to a one, everyone I know who does Shorinji Kempo are all on the same page in assuring me its not a cult.<br />On a more serious note, I especially enjoyed his description of the training.  ... it seems people are offended for three over-arching reasons--they/their instructor/their colleagues are portrayed less than ideally, aikido isn't portrayed as a land of Ki Society milk and honey, or the Japanese aren't portrayed as a group of hyper-rational, hyper-polite salarymen.  ...  ...  In my subject, I used the term appallingly honest because I doubt Twigger realized the gravity of his sins--airing his, the Yoshinkan's, and Japanese society's dirty drawers in public.  After all, only a gauche foreigner who never made the effort would bring this up publicly.  He forgot he was supposed to write about the glory of his adversity, the glorious mythology of his teachers, and the grandeur of Japan.  Anything else would be unacceptable.  Looking back, I suspect the story over his roommate's missing undies is symbolic.<br />In my experience in another Japanese system, instructors and training compadres often were a tad loopy and sometimes borderline mean and sometimes, well, just plain old fashioned mean.  Likewise, in my experience training with aikidoka, they're the ones who come the closest to actually injuring me.  For a while, I thought I was alone in noticing this, but I've heard others, including my aiki friends, say the same thing.	2003-03-18

I happened upon this book when searching for a primer on Chinese history and I figured I'd mix the general with the specific and grabbed both.<br />Well, as you might suspect, I finished this book in a 3 day period and I've barely begun the other book.  I'm not a religious guy, but reading the first half of this book requires a Job-like outlook.  You'll believe human suffering is at its apex and then, wham, you'll hear yet another horrific story involving a partial beheading, a mass public immolation, or weapon-forced incest.  Ms. Chang at her best when she chronicles  the horrors found via diary or interview.  While she's a tad polemical, these silent victims dramatically need their polemicist.<br />Why only 4 stars?  Ms. Chang's work on the broader picture--the cultural, political, and organizational causes of the massacre and its \\"non-issueness\\" after the war--wasn't compelling.  If you wanna understand why the Japanese Army did what it did, you're gonna need to look somewhere else.  If you wanna understand why Japanese society works so hard to deny the massacre, ya gotta look somewhere else.  If you wanna understand how a disciplined organization turned into a Sierra Leone-like thugs, it's somewhere else.	2002-08-15

I read this book in two sittings.  Given current events, I was more motivated than I would have been otherwise.  As I write this review, I'm conflicted because I was nauseated by the author's obviously convenient morality while enjoying his depictions of his time in Israel.  If you just can't be bothered by your responsibilities to society, I can understand how fashionable it would be to present yourself as a secular, conscientious objector.  In the final epilogue, Mr. Black attempts to reconcile his behavior vis a vis Israel's social contract.<br />I would've been more sympathethic if his rationalizations appeared more honest or if he wasn't a well-educated, well-traveled male, who should, by age 27, the speed at which 3 years passes.  However, having read the previous chapters, it felt more like he, like the trust-funded, party boy who resists joining the family business, just couldn't be bothered with his part of the bargain.  As I finish this paragraph, I wonder if my Jewish college friends would've dismissively labelled him with that nebulous Yiddish insult--nebbish.<br />Now with that largely feel-good rant complete, in the main, I enjoyed \\"meeting\\" the people he described to us (my personal favorite was the lady making that godawful stuff Turks call coffee).  Furthermore, I especially enjoyed the section detailing the sport of Israeli politics during elections as well as the sections on life in the kibbutz.  Finally, I got fine laughs out of his interactions with the driver's license examiner and the deferment board.<br />Bottom line:  I enjoyed the book and the author writes well, but found his character unimpressive by the end of the book	2002-04-27

Mr. Webb created believable and compelling characters. Hodges, Snake, and Goodrich all kept my attention throughout the book. Overall, my favorite section of the book came when Goodrich returned home. While I thought the confrontation with Harvard anti-war protesters was cliche, his conversation with his father was extremely well-done. If I recall correctly, the father's wise words--&quot;morality combined with self-interest isn't really about morality&quot;--rang appropriate to me.	2001-08-28

In many ways, Tufte strikes a masterful balance between detail and abstraction. Furthermore I was staggered by Tufte's breadth of subject. With case studies as varied as a cholera outbreak, a Challenger explosion, and computer simulation of a thunderstorm, there's something for everyone. In a nutshell, the book was worth reading for a single (now obvious) concept--by emphasizing everything, you emphasize nothing.	2001-08-28

Instead, you get some short articles (of uneven quality) by his students.

Since I've never read a book on literary criticism before, I wasn't sure what to expect but Professor Ellis' book exceeded my expectations.<br />Overall, it's obvious the Professor understands his topic as well as his opponents.  I laughed out loud when he explained how another critic botched one of his interpretations of Dr. Ellis' own writings (why didn't he use the word touche?).  Similarly, I'll rave about Frank Kermode's rant back at one of his detractors.  It was a powerful end to a chapter.  Finally, I must agree with one of his unfortunate conclusions.  Since they have their own departments, the race/gender/class fad will be a permanent fixture on campus.<br />In the interest of balance, I tried to find (via google) the \\"other side's\\" reaction to this book.  Remarkably, except for positive reviews, there's been little public response to this book.  This leads me to believe one of two things are likely:  the agenda professoriat has collectively decided to ignore this book or the Professor's criticisms are unanswerable (actually, I could probably be more general--the criticisms are unanswerable and, as a result, the professoriat finds it best to ignore the book). <br />Looking back, I only wished I hadn't read the chapter on \\"Theory.\\"  It was a bit long and, presumably since I'm not a professional student of literature, wasn't very compelling to me.	2001-08-13

Not goofy in a HAHA sense, but, goofy in a &quot;got hit on the head&quot; sense.  While I enjoyed Quan's travels as well as the supporting characters, the author waxed lyrically too long and too often.  While a dab of this language would have made the prose sparkle, a thick coating only made things more dull.<br />Overall, it's worth a checkout from the library.	2001-07-13

With a few exceptions--the narrator and his father--I genuinely liked most of the characters in the book, but I found this to be a bit of a problem--they were all *characters.*  Similarly, as I read the book, I sensed heroic adulation sprinkled liberally throughout.  Unfortunately, many of the heroes exhibited behavior that shouldn't be emulated.  I especially wondered about the rather heroic depiction of Buddy's father.  His signature behaviors--intimidating those around him, whoring around on his wife, and ignoring the resulting children--aren't what passes for heroism.  Overall, I was surprised the narrator didn't include a single story about a stable, well-adjusted, decent, family-man.  Remarkably, the non-fictional, but ancillary, Taky Kimura did the best job of filling this role.<br />Furthermore, the role of women in the book was a bit strange.  With the exception of Buddy's ever-so-religious, ever-so-pure mother, they were cast, rather angrily, as stupid whores.  Since I wouldn't normally notice such things, the author must've done this explicitly.  I don't understand what the author's motivation for this might have been.	2001-06-04

Unfortunately, the examples weren't compelling to me at all.  While the lambda calculus interpreter was interesting, the time spent on the theorem prover was not very interesting (I wonder if it was added as an homage to ML's legacy??).<br />Overall, I suppose this book is a little dated.	2000-12-08

Personally, While I could identify with both protagonists, I tired of their characters early on.  The author's coverage of Reider's internal struggles (new second lieutenants are filled with self-doubt. . .shocker!!) went on. . .and on. . .and on. . .and on.  Similarly, Nathan Dixon's character got old quickly(tho' a bit less quickly).  Finally, the author did a poor job developing the characters of the enlisted men and NCOs.<br />Lastly, unlike his other books I've read, there really was no &quot;tiering&quot; of the drama.  In previous books, we would have been privy to the happenings at Fort Apache and we would've been with Seargeant Taylor when his Bradley Fighting Vehicles were attacked.  This book, much like the soldiers of 3rd Platoon, rambled along in the fog (as I write this review, I wonder if that was the point).<br />Bottom line:  if you like military fiction, it is worth a checkout from public library.	2000-12-08

After reading this book, I finally explicitly understand what I found troubling with socialism--it *requires* obedience to ensure adherence to the plan.  As I read this book, I couldn't help notice the parallels between this book and &quot;1984.&quot;  Since that book was written in 1948, I suspect Orwell was directly influenced by this book.  Furthermore, I found &quot;The Socialist Roots of Naziism&quot; a unique take on how socialism and naziism are brethren of the same cloth.<br />The only thing I found annoying were the periodic German and Latin idioms.  This is an extremely minor complaint given the era as well as the intended (presumably academic) audience.<br />A final comment, Forbes' Ronald Bailey is quoted on the front jacket, &quot;Nearly half a century ago, most of the smart people sneered with Friedrich Hayek published &quot;The Road to Serfdom.&quot;  The world was wrong and Hayek was right&quot;  If &quot;most of the smart people sneered&quot; then this book was truly a courageous and visionary work.	2000-10-29

Unfortunately, as the author went on  and on, I just began to wish it would end.<br />Overall, this entire premise  would've been better covered in a 8-10 page magazine article.  Brevity may  be known as the source of wit, but for some of us, brevity is also the  source of 5 star book reviews.<br />As a plus, I thought the author did a good  job of footnoting her anecdotes.	2000-08-24

Oftentimes, I found humor where it wasn't expected--the author's 1000 brick punishment for the man who had stolen her bedspread, the feminist  caricatures, as well as, the antics at the baby shower (who'da thunk it? ).   Similarly, I was also discouraged  where it wasn't expected--the medical  student who wanted to marry the author's, likely HIV+, sister-in-law  (discouraged because if he didn't understand/care about the risk he was  taking, how could any of his other relatives?).   Furthermore, I was also  unpleasantly surprised at the author's depiction of rampant infidelity in  the book.<br />Finally, I particularly enjoyed the stories about the author's  mother.  She appears to be a particularly savvy and strong woman.   Specifically, I found the story of her first beer quite  remarkable.<br />Overall, I've assumed this book to be, like &quot;I,  Rigoberta Menchu,&quot; auto-biographical in nature and non-fiction that's  *based on* the truth of a people.

As responding appropriately to change isn't rocket science, I see this simplicity as the  book's greatest strength.  Similarly, many have voiced the bizarre  criticism that the book doesn't focus on punishing those who moved the  cheese.  This criticism is especially pointless because punishment (while  presumably making you *feel* better) does nothing to remedy your particular  situation.<br />Overall, I suspect your reaction to this book depends on  whether you generally view life through half-full or half-empty glasses.	2000-06-05

Everytime I read it, Mr. Spence's self-aggrandizement and intellectual dishonesty turn my stomach.  <br />I suppose my &quot;emotional quotient&quot; or some such isn't high  enough, but (as others have stated) &quot;making them feel sorry for  you&quot; may mean you win, but it doesn't make it an ethically correct  thing to do.  I guess I was particularly disappointed because he could've  made a similar point--you must emphatically believe what you're  saying--without encouraging people to paint themselves in an artificially  pathetic light.<br />Finally, I was most surprised at what a proud man  Mr.  Spence was.  Of course, I suppose that's part of what makes him a good  lawyer.<br />To be fair, I did enjoy some of the stories (hence, the second  star).

As I attempt to write this review (the book left me &quot;speechless&quot;), phrases like well researched, superbly organized, and spot-on spring to mind.

Similarly, although I initially found the authors' discussion of  due process tedious and lengthy, I now realize the amount of detail they  provided was necessary *and* appropriate.

I'm convinced these chapters were  written for the author's emotional benefit.<br />I found the concepts of  habitability and compression remarkable as the author used them to frame  old discussions in a new way.  Echoing a previous reviewer's comments, I  was captivated by the discussion on rugs as well as the book's final  chapter.  Lastly, I'd like to thank the author for recommending Williams'  &quot;Style:  Towards Clarity and Grace.&quot;  Based on his  recommendation, I bought a copy this afternoon.

Specifically, I found the discussions about the political atmosphere on  campus and the ideological straitjacket of the left (the Hitchens chapter)  &quot;right on&quot; target.  Finally, I found the chapters about the Black  Panthers (before my time) fascinating.<br />I'd imagine most progressives will  find a lot to dislike in this book.

That being said, he was nowhere near balanced.  Furthermore, he never presented reasonable solutions (the final two chapters are full of loopy ideas) for the problems he outlined.  <br />Finally, he never addresses the  observation that countries can still choose to *not* become part of the  global economy if they so desire (globalization doesn't have to happen).   Similarly, with regards to IMF and World Bank loans, he lobbies  (presumably) for debt forgiveness, but never convincingly addresses why the  debt should be forgiven when it was voluntarily assumed (BTW:  the author  makes the bizarre argument that the debt was *not* assumed voluntarily and  therefore should be exempt from repayment).  In general, the strangest  thing about his book was that he ignored the obvious--several of his  egregegious examples  (ie the Philippine gold mine) were perpetrated by the  government against their own people (again, the balance thing).<br />If you're  in the choir that believes corporations are evil and should be severely  restrained, Mr. Korten is your preacher and this book is your Bible.	2000-01-26

It's reasonably comprehensive and written for people who actually plan on writing Erlang programs.  Furthermore, it even uses understandable real-life examples.	1999-04-13

As opposed to other books I have seen, this book really allows you to see the markings of the individual animal.  As Swissies are tri-colored, this seems to me to be especially important.<br />Well done.  I sat and read it immediately from start to finish.	1998-05-01
