The writer characters are all based on science-fiction writers of the time. <br /> <br />Robert Edward James identifies most of them in his review, but I'll mention that another is based on L. Ron Hubbard (e-mail me for more information, if you want me to tell you who it is).  And \\"Hillary Foulkes,\\" the obnoxious son of a famous author, is also the son of a famous author who invented a famous character (again, I'll tell you who in an e-mail, but you SHOULD be able to figure that one out). <br /> <br />And I thought the mystery was well done, aside from painting a nice picture of the U.S. on the eve of war.

Efron's book THE NEWS TWISTERS was the first powerful challenge to liberal bias in media.<br /><br />An honest man would tell you in a straightforward way how Efron investigated media bias, what she said she found, where you could find the raw data (if it's available), and other such things that would allow a rational evaluation of her argument.<br /><br />What Brock does is use guilt by association. Efron got money from a foundation that was founded by a guy who was a lobbyist for Chiang Kai Shek, and who was allegedly friendly to Sen. Joe McCarthy.  So that shows . . . well, it shows nothing, except that Brock knows how to push left wing buttons, and use guilt by association. (Bill Buckley, Nixon, Charles Colson, E. Howard Hunt, and Pat Buchanan are brought in too.) Efron was connected to bad people, so she's bad too.  Sen. McCarthy used to do the same thing, I'm told.  (I look forward to Brock's expose of people receiving grants from the Ford Foundation.  Old Henry founded it to avoid estate taxes!  He was a notorious Jew hater! Obviously, everyone who gets a grant from Ford is a dishonest bigoted taxcheat.)<br /><br />There's plenty more McCarthyite nonsense in the excerpt.  Brock is good at using the sneering phrase, such as \\"free market fundamentalist,\\" or \\"one woman show,\\" which mean little and have nothing to do with evidence and reason (they do, however, fill space, which might keep you from noticing that there's not much substance to his case).<br /><br />You can also fill space by talking about irrelevancies. Efron wrote a book about cancer. Somebody else said it was a bad book with a political agenda. What does this have to do with media bias? Nothing.<br /><br />When not trotting out irrelevancies, Brock likes to imply dishonesty in those he disagrees with.  They're just hacks, saying what they say because they're paid by the right.  Hmm, do you think Brock writes for free?<br /><br />Eventually, Brock tells you that Efron's research method in THE NEWS TWISTERS was to record news shows, make transcripts, and then analyze them for bias.  No good, he says, all such judgments are subjective, and therefore need not be taken seriously.<br /><br />Hold that thought. All judgments concerning media bias are subjective, and shouldn't be taken seriously.  This appears in the first chapter of a book that purports to analyze bias!<br /><br />Thanks Davie.

Other than that, perfect. <br /> <br />It starts with a bang, about 60 kilotons, and goes on from there, as a physics experiment gone wrong ends up opening multiple \\"gates\\" to other worlds.  Some of them connect to hostile aliens, and earth is fighting for its life against invaders with superior technology, physical and biological. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, there's a little girl that lived when she should have died; an alien something that looks like a stuffed toy, communicates telepathicaly, and can taser those who mess with it; \\"the Charge of the Redneck Brigade;\\" a more or less friendly alien species; talking cats; Cthulhu; and a phycisist in the middle of everything because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time -- or was it the right place? <br /> <br />Lots of fun, and the start of a new Ringo series.

During this time, the crime rate dropped steadily, in all categories. Anyone, including criminals and the insane, could buy any type of firearm they wanted.    From 1870 till 1920, various bureaucrats tried to get gun control instituted. Aside from a few minor taxes, they failed. Crime continued to drop.    From 1920 till today, there have been ever increasing bans on guns in Britain.  The rate of all crimes has risen throughout the past 85 years.    [Sarcasm] Undoubtedly, this is just a coincidence, or a pack of lies. It must be true that guns cause crime. Important people say so, and they are infallible, aren't they?[/Sarcasm]    If you have an open mind, you'll learn a lot from this book. But on the subject of guns, most people don't have open minds.  Pity.	2005-05-06

The endnote numbers were left out of the text, and there weren't many of them to begin with.  It's sometimes rambling and repetious.  It's indexing of Soviet covernames is pathetic.  And sometimes, I think West's conclusions are seriously askew, as when he identifies codename VEKSAL as Fermi rather than Oppenheimer.  And there are a number of small, annoying mistakes (such as getting years wrong).          None of that matters very much, though they did cost the book its fifth star.  What matters is that in _Mortal Crimes_, Nigel West has pulled together huge amounts of material, including FBI files, VENONA decrypts, and recently released intelligence files from the former Soviet Union (OOH!  I just LOVE to type \\"former Soviet Union!\\").  The KGB and GRU (as they are usually known) penetrated the U.S. government and scientific reasearch to an extent hard to grasp.  There were about 200 active information sources in the U.S. at the end of WWII, and they supplied incredible amounts of information to the Soviets.          I've been following the story of Soviet Espionage against the Manhattan Project for over ten years, and I found some new and important information about every other page: reasons to suspect Hans Bethe of espionage; possible identification of spy RELAY as Phillip Morrison; evidence of hard left associations of Ernest Lawrence(!); connections between spies William Weisband and Julius Rosenberg; the difficulties imposed by the way counter-intelligence was compartmentalized; the flood of atomic information from Britain; partial confirmation of Sudoplatov's charges against Robert Oppenheimer.          There's some very good coverage of the Canadian phase of the espionage as well.          I read this book in two days, and will soon reread it, indexing some of the information it contains.  For any serious inquirer into Soviet Espionage, this book is a must.	2005-04-25

As a result of that ancestory, Taylor has powers, including being able to find anything.  As another result of his ancestory, Taylor has enemies that have been trying to kill him since childhood. <br /> <br />Five years before the novel opens, Taylor left the Nightside for the mundane world.  Then a client waves a lot of money and hires him to find her runaway daughter, who's disappeared there.  So Taylor goes home. <br /> <br />The story is told in flat, Hammett-like style that some of the reviewers didn't like, but I did.  It fits the hard-boiled private detective genre this novel uses, while setting off the constant comic throwaway lines Green hands the reader -- 'A Neanderthal in a business suit was talking with a dwarf in full SS regalia.' A backpack nuclear bomb displayed in a shop window: 'Probably defective, have to supply your own plutonium or something.  Otherwise, somebody would already have bought it.' Taylor and his client walk down a street, and find themselves in the future: 'Timeslip. Those things are supposed to be posted!' Or a man who stinks so badly, he attracts flies 'Every once in a while, one got too close, and the stench killed it.'  An alley that can't always be found, because the alley doesn't want to be associated with a business located there. The reviewers who didn't find this funny are suffering humor impairment. <br /> <br />The setting is brilliantly realized: cars in the street, plus things that look like cars, many of them hungry for pedestrians; Strangefellows, the world's oldest bar; a street gang that consists of demons; the ghost of cafe from the sixties, where the Coke tastes better; the place the Timeslip takes them to, which makes the Nightside look cheery and harmless; the Harrowing, nameless beings without faces, and hypodermic sryinges for fingers; and the place where the runaway girl finally is found. <br /> <br />Taylor hunts for the missing girl, encountering old friends and old enemies, though sometimes he's not sure which is which.  But regardless of what he encounters, he won't stop till he's done the job he was hired for. <br /> <br />This is the first novel of Green's I've read, and I'll be reading more as soon as I can get them.  There are three more in the \\"Nightside\\" series, as well as other series by Green I intend to check out. <br /> <br />I like this book a lot.  Highly recommended.	2005-04-11

Green's \\"Nightside\\" series, and it's even better than the first. <br /> <br />The Nightside is the magical, corrupt heart of London, where it's always 3:00 AM, and everything is available for a price.  John Taylor is the hard-boiled private eye who was born there, and who's only half human. Taylor can find anything.   <br /> <br />He's just finished a tough case when he's hired by the Vatican to find the Unholy Grail, the U. G. being the cup that Judas drank from.  And the Vatican isn't the only one searching for it -- so are Angels, Fallen Angels, magicians, mafiosi, and the secret powerful Authorities of the Nightside, all of whom intend to make an offer Taylor he can't refuse: find it for us, or we destroy you, Taylor. <br /> <br />But Taylor has already been hired, and he never betrays a client.  With his old friend Shotgun Suzie, a bounty hunter who once shot him (Suzie has difficulty showing affection), he dodges Angels, questions demons, and narrates the sights: a case with a bible inside it, marked \\"In case of Apocalypse, break glass;\\" the headquarters of a group of religous fanatics, with a poster saying \\"Have you killed an unbeliever today?\\"; zombies at a show for the dead, applauding carefully and making sure nothing falls off; Merlin, raised from the dead and told the building may be destroyed at any moment \\"Damn, it's always something;\\" and those are just what I remember off the top of my head. <br /> <br />Like the first novel in the series, \\"Something From the Nightside,\\" I liked this a lot. Highly recommended. I'll be starting the third one, \\"Nightengale's Lament,\\" later today.	2005-04-11

He was also incredibly lucky.&nbsp; But none of this saved him when he became commander of the Army of the Potomac.&nbsp; As a general, he failed miserably. <br /> <br />Sears puts his finger on McClellan's weak point: his utter inability to deal with uncertainty.&nbsp; In his entire Civil War career, McClellan planned and fought only one battle, Antietam.&nbsp; And he only fought because Lee blindly refused the chance to run away that McClellan held out to him for two days running.&nbsp; The rest of the battles fought by Union forces McC. commanded were planned and commanded by others, and in all but two cases, he wasn't even with the troops that were fighting.&nbsp; In both those cases, he never gave an order once the shooting began.&nbsp; This is moral cowardice of the worst sort, and utterly contemptible. <br /> <br />Stephen Sears goes through the details of McClellan's dismal performance as a general, showing how badly McClellan failed the Union and the Army he genuinely loved.&nbsp; It's rather repititious at times, but that's because McClellan was rather repititious.&nbsp; He made the same errors again and again, for the same reasons. <br /> <br />If you're interested in the life of George B.

Lee has never been objectively considered as a man and general.   Instead, he says Lee has become an icon, a sacred symbol of the rightness of the Secessionist cause.   There is much truth in this. <br /> <br />Nolan goes on to say he will attempt to examine the Lee myth and compare it with the facts.   It is here that he sometimes falls down. <br /> <br />In some respects, Nolan seems right on the money. He documents that Lee's opposition to slavery was almost purely verbal -- someday, God in his wisdom would end slavery, but till then, everyone was obliged to allow it to continue unmolested. Quite a few of Lee's fellow slave holders felt the same way. The possibility that the Civil War Between the States was God's way of ending the Peculiar Institution never occured. <br /> <br />Nolan also shows that Lee had typical attitudes of a white southerner of his time towards blacks, namely, he didn't like them very much and felt that they were inferior to whites; that Lee frequently referred to the Union forces as 'the enemy;' and that Lee wasn't infallible as a general. It's long past time such simple points were made. <br /> <br />But other times Nolan is quite bizarre. Although he doesn't quite say it, he seems to feel that Lee was morally obligated to fight for the Union, because as an officer in the U.S. Army he'd taken a loyalty oath to the govt. So what? No one at the time expected that oath to be binding on someone who'd resigned his comission. Nolan flatly argues that Lee should have surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia to Grant sometime after the fall of Atlanta, and certainly shortly after the re-election of Lincoln. It doesn't seem to occur to him that he probably couldn't have done this, physically (why would his officers and men obey, when they were in touch with Richmond, where Davis was most certainly not surrendering?), and Nolan doesn't realize that this would have been a betrayal of Lee's oath to support the Constitution of the Confederate States. <br /> <br />And although Lee did more than anyone else North or South to heal the divisions of the War, this isn't enough for Nolan. He thinks Lee should have made a public repudiation of the Secession. Why he imagines Lee would think the cause he fought for was wrong and immoral he never says. Heck, I'm a stone Union man, and I can't see how Lee would have come to that conclusion. <br /> <br />Still, this book is a good begining on the task of finally seeing Robert Edward Lee clearly, as a very great and good man and general, but not the Christ figure some historians have made him out to be. Despite its flaws, its worth reading and thinking about.	2004-08-13

Johnston: A Civil War Biography (Norton Paperback)	Books	4	7	19	N	N	A General Who Missed the Point	Joseph Johnston was the highest ranking officer in the U.S. Army to resign and 'go South.'&nbsp;  He attained the rank of full General almost immediately.&nbsp;  He was immensely popular with his men and most of the politicians of the Confederacy.&nbsp;  And he was an unmitigated disaster as a Confederate commander. <br /> <br />The biggest flaw of this biography is that it tells you the how and why of the first three points, but totally misses the fourth.&nbsp; But Johnston's failure as a commander is one of the easiest things to see when reviewing his war record.&nbsp; Aside from First Manassas, where he won mostly by luck, his only other signifigant accomplishment was to get wounded badly in the battle of Seven Pines, thus putting Robert E. Lee in charge of the Army of Northern Virginia. <br /> <br />Although controversies concerning the Civil War Between the States still rage, one point everyone agrees on is the simple factual point that the Union outnumbered the Confederacy about two to one in total population, and four to one in white population.&nbsp; That meant the Rebel armies had to fight outnumbered and still win, as a nation and frequently in individual battles. <br /> <br />Johnston never grasped this simple point, though the amateur Lincoln was on record with it by the end of 1861.&nbsp; This is probably because Johnston was a moral coward, terrified of taking risks and constantly dodging responsibility, a point Symonds makes very well.&nbsp; Johnston spent the war continually whining that the entire Confederacy should be stripped of troops, so he could be reinforced.&nbsp; Once he had local superiority of force, he guaranteed he would win brilliant victories for the South.&nbsp;  The fact that the North would always be able to assemble more men to oppose him than he had was something he couldn't quite grasp.&nbsp;  Nor could he come to grips with the fact that that the Union, having put together a force that would give Johnston pause, could then the rest of their manpower superiority to invade an undefended region and remove its resources from Rebel control. <br /> <br />For a while Johnston was lucky in his career of Confederate general.&nbsp; He faced the relatively inept McDowell, and then George B. McClellan, who was even more of a moral coward than Johnston.&nbsp; But eventually he had to deal with Grant and Sherman, and he wasn't up to the challenge. <br /> <br />The fact that all this also goes right by the author of this biography is puzzling, because Symonds is otherwise very good.&nbsp; He has the details of Johnston's life at his fingertips, and writes well.&nbsp; But a really definitive biography awaits someone who understands the strategic context the Confederacy faced, and why Johnston's approach was sure to lose.	2004-08-13

Particularly bad was Leonidas Polk, who was a bad enough general to singlehandedly doom the Confederacy, but there were other offenders.<br />A military genius might have overcome this.  Bragg was merely above average for a Confederate commander, and thus he never had a chance.<br />Very interesting, and the maps are outstanding, among the best I've ever seen in a history.<br />Read it to see how a bad culture can foul up a good army with a good commander.	2004-06-22

The Northern states were violating the Southern states rights to do something or another, and the South had no choice except secession in order to preserve 'Constitutional' govt.  Union supporters insist that this isn't so.  So what really happened?<br />Prof. Charles Dew cuts right to the heart of things by quoting the arguments made in 1861 by supporters of secession.  Seven states passed secession ordinances in 1860 and '61, and four of them sent representatives to other slave states, explaining the reasons why they too should secede.<br />So what was the Southern cause?  Surprise, surprise.  It was WHITE SUPREMACY.  The South needed to secede before the North amended the Constitution.  In the nightmare world of the disunionists, the \\"Black Republicans,\\" as the South invariably called them, were bent on seeing a South simultaneously: drenched in blood when the slaves rose in revolt; drenched in equality, as whites and blacks lived together withouth a master race; and drenched in miscegnation, as the races became one. Of course, it was logically impossible for all these things to happen at the same time, but logic was not the South's strong point.<br />Neither was honesty.  As Dew makes clear, disunionists started lying about why they'd pushed secession as soon as they lost. Dew notes he was indoctrinated during his Florida youth with the story that \\"the South had seceded for one reason and one reason only: states' rights;\\"  Dew also quotes contemporary neo-Confederates trying to deny the truth that the South was trying to preserve White Supremacy and Slavery.<br />Their sucessors keep it up: Art Chance maintains \\"No serious student of the War of Southern Independence can doubt that slavery and Southern perceptions of Northern fanaticism were the proximate causes of secession.\\"  Chance then tries to change the subject to 'why did the North resist Southern Aggression?' (Answer: we were fed up with being pushed around by the South).<br />'A reader from USA' sets up a fantasy about the Founding Fathers, citing a book titled FORCED FOUNDERS (go look at the reviews; they say the Virginian Founders were motivated by anti-slavery).<br />'tabsaw' says the book \\"walks down the road well traveled,\\" without giving titles of any of the other books making this argument.<br />Still, we progress.  Not even the apologists for slavery reviewing this book have the nerve to deny that preserving Slavery and White Supremacy was the South's reason for secession.  Once we get that established, we'll be able to go on to more interesting issues.	2004-06-14

This is quite true, and we can justly point out that what Nathan Bedford Forrest figured out in his first action ('Never make a frontal attack if there's a half-way decent alternative'), R. E.

But a one-sentence idea does not make a book.<br />Second, Alexander rehashes his 1996 volume &quot;Lost Victories: The Military Genius of Stonewall Jackson.&quot;  If only Davis and Lee and _listened_ to Jackson, we're told, and implemented his strategies, the South would have won in 1862 or '63.  But war is the realm of uncertainty: the one time Jackson's ideas were followed to the letter, Chancellorsville, things didn't go as planned,  Jackson died, and it's arguable that Hooker would have won the battle if he hadn't been wounded.<br />Thirdly, there's fantasy masquerading as analysis.  For instance, during the Gettysburg campaign, Lee should have attacked Philadelphia!  That would have taken the Army of Northern Virginia 80 or so miles further into Northern territory, cut Lee's line of retreat, and enabled Lincoln to move troops there first via Philadelphia's thickest concentration of rail lines, but what the heck, it was certain to work because . . . well, that's where I lose the thread.<br />And then there's random inconsistency.  Lee was a menace to the Confederacy because he constantly made frontal assaults on superior numbers in strong positions.  Braxton Bragg, otoh, invaded KY in the summer of '62, and had a chance to take Lexington -- by making a frontal assault against superior numbers in a strong position.  Ah, but Bragg also had an entire separate Union force on his tail, one that ALSO outnumbered him.  Besides, Bragg's troops were badly worn out by marching and short rations, and Bragg's subordinates frequently disobeyed orders withouteven telling Bragg what they were doing.  So obviously Bragg's failure to attack Lexington reflects a loss of nerve, because a Confederate attack would have inevitably won.  &quot;RIGHT!&quot;, as Noah said to the Lord.<br />There are many good books on the Civil War.

As a Union man this pleases me, but as an amateur historian, I wonder if there might not have been a better strategy -- especially since most observers in 1861 thought the odds in the South's favor were overwhelming.    What was Confederate strategy? Tanner never gives a coherent explanation, but it seemed to be a mixture of \\"annihilate Union Armies,\\" and \\"defend all territory at all times.\\" Obviously, these goals can conflict. Further, neither leads directly to victory.    Victory in war consists of getting the enemy to give up his resistance to your aims. The U.S. succeeded in doing this to Britain, twice. The strategy wasn't pure annihilation or total territorial defense. Rather, offense, defense, maneuver war, guerrilla war and strategic retreat were combined. A reconsideration of Confederate strategy might think about this, and discuss options.    Instead, Tanner gives us false dichotomies -- e.g., either the Confederacy had to do exactly what it did, or it could retreat from its northern border to approximately Florida.    Sometimes, Tanner pretends to discuss manuver warfare, such as Stonewall Jackson's. This is rejected by using logical fallacy: if the number present for duty was (reportedly) less after hard marching, the marches caused the drop. Also because battle casualties sometimes recover, because the wounded can sometimes keep fighting, and because Confederate casualty statistics were extremely shaky, we should assume marches kill, maim, and hospitalize as many as major battles! (I know it must seem that I'm distorting or misunderstanding Tanner. Well, see pp. 59-61, and if you can come up with another meaning, write me and explain, PLEASE!) Never discussed is the fact that Union armies had to move fast when chasing Jackson, and so presumably incurred their own march casualties.    Then there's a chapter on Clausewitz. It ignores most of what the great Prussian wrote.    There also seems to be a good deal of flat lying in this book. For example, Tanner's version of Braxton Bragg's invasion of Kentucky is contradicted on most points by every other source I've consulted. Since these sources agree, and base their accounts on the official records, I can only conclude Tanner made his story up.    Tanner does bring up real difficulties with possible Confederate alternatives. But they existed in previous wars, and the U.S. won when using them. That goes undiscussed.    A real reconsideration of Confederate strategy would be welcome. This isn't it.	2004-06-03

Nowhere on p. 32 is anyone mentioned as being an expert, nor is it even implied that anyone in the British Army was an expert in the performance of the Brown Bess.

Strachan's book goes on to say on p. 47 that the rifled musket resulted in &quot;whole regiments 'melting' before British fire&quot; at Inkerman; that penetration was much greater than with the musket (very significant when people fought in closely packed groups); that &quot;At 150 yards the Minie was twice as accurate as the smoothbore musket,&quot; and &quot;Furthermore this superiority of practice was not confined to a few marksmen.&quot;<br />Another: in ATTACK AND DIE: CIVIL WAR TACTICS AND THE SOUTHERN HERITAGE, Grady McWhiney &amp; Perry D.

Griffith blames the failure of Napoleonic tactics in the Civil War on the troops being amateurs and the generals not knowing how to fight.<br />Griffith misunderstands what's in front of him. G. mentions Jack Coggins's books ARMS AND EQUIPMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR, and calls your attention to an illustration on page 38-39 of Coggins, showing that in order to hit a target at 300 yards range, the bullet traveled 43 inches above line of sight at 150 yards. Griffith fails to realize that if the shooter is standing or kneeling, the bullet will be so high in the air it won't hit people at most ranges, but if the shooter fires from ground level (prone, or from a trench), it will NEVER get too high. Therefore, the effectiveness of rifle fire increased as entrenchments became more common.<br />Griffith just makes up bullsh*t. E.g., by mid 1863, soldiers were reluctant to attack entrenchments frontally. G. believes they were 'dispirited,' a bunch of 'old lags' who'd lost their nerve.

During this period, the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia both took about 45% casualties in only 40 days, while in Tennessee and Georgia Hood's Army was destroyed in combat when repeatedly attacking Sherman's troops.<br />Enough.

Durden doesn't always print the documents in chronological order, resulting in potential confusion about what the state of opinion was when.  And he relies far to much on 'official' sources, rather than the privately expressed views of Southerners in their letters and diaries.<br />That last is important because one of the great issues of the debate was what effect recruiting black soldiers would have on whites: would they stand for it?  Durden quotes various memorials some soldiers made urging the govt. to recruit slaves as soldiers, but I wonder how many dissenting opinions were surpressed by the pressure of officers desperate for troops?  James MacPherson's book WHAT THEY FOUGHT FOR suggests that the picture in the Confederate Army was not nearly as one sided as the one Durden's documents present.<br />There are many other fascinating questions worth pursuing in this area: how many blacks would have volunteered (some did), and how well would they have fought?  If the fateful step had been taken in time, how would it have affected the war, and postwar relations between blacks and whites in the South?  Durden doesn't attempt to answer these questions, but I wish someone would.<br />It's sad that after over thirty years so few have sought to follow Durden's pioneering inquiry.  This book is still the only extended treatment of this subject I've found.  But even if there were dozens, I believe I'd still recommend it highly.  A very good work indeed.	2004-03-30

This causes the people on the other side get scared and run away.  He also has a historical agenda: to convince people that British generals of the First World War such as Field Marshall Sir Douglas, Earl Haig, were not incompetent butchers, madmen, and liars.<br />Alas, the theory of tactics isn't true, and neither is the agenda.  People in combat only get scared when they think they might get hurt.  Even when they're scared, they frequently stick around and fight.   As a result, a lot of people get hurt, or killed.  As for WWI generalship, most British commanders were unfit to command anything.<br />But if Griffith dealt with these facts in a straightforward way, he'd have to explain that hundreds of thousands of British soldiers in WWI were REPEATEDLY ordered to march slowly toward the the enemy, creating not fear but just a large target, dying for nothing.  Apparently this truth is too painful for him to acknowledge.<br />So instead, we get fantasy.  In chapter two, for example, Griffith tells us that Wellington's troops typically fired their muskets at the enemy for the sole purpose of making a loud noise, did one volley only, then walked forward shouting and waving their bayonets in the air.  Supposedly,this display panicked their opponents, despite the fact that no one had actually been hurt (Well, after all, they were only frenchmen, what would you expect?).<br />As evidence of this, Griffith shows the British officers arguing over what ammunition was the most effective (p42), but discounting mere noise as ineffective (p 25 & 27); presents data from 19 battles, in which AT LEAST 74% (14/19) featured more than one musket volley (p39); quotes eyewitnesses saying British musketry \\"carried destruction into the heart of the French line (p36),\\" or \\"produced a commencement of carnage and destruction (p18);\\" and by showing several cases where muskets alone broke the French (p23 & 25), but none where the redcoats used noise and swagger alone.<br />What, you say that evidence completely contradicts Griffith's claim of harmless scare tactics?  Congratulations, you can read! Apparently, Griffith can't.<br />Such nonsense continues throughout the book.  In Ch. 3, Griffith claims that battlefields from 1808 to 1915 were really much like WWII, with soldiers trying to be invisible, and anonymous firefights the order of the day.  Thus, everyone could reasonably expect that the tactics of WWI would be rather like the tactics of the Napoleonic Wars.  Aside from the fact that it completely contradicts the claims of Ch. 2, it's also false.  In Ch. 4 we find out that tanks are almost harmless, and that what was really important in WWI was the new infantry tactics developed by all armies 'after the begining of the Battle of the Somme.'  This contradicts ch. 3, and is also inaccurate (the new tactics were developed by the Germans in 1915, with the Allies acting later; tanks were what won the war for the Allies).  In ch. 5, we hear how ineffective USAmerican technology was in Viet Nam, compared to N. Vietnamese guts.  This undoubtedly explains why the U.S. won every battle, the Viet Cong guerillas were wiped out, and S. Viet Nam was conquered in 1975 by an armored force with more tanks than Hitler used to invade Russia.<br />And btw, although Griffith frequently cites original sources, he does so unreliably.  When I checked some of them, they often said quite different things then Griffith wants you to believe they said.  But that's not surprising, considering how often the evidence he reprints contradicts his own judgements.<br />We've only scratched the surface of Griffith's misrepresentations, but I don't have space to refute every page of the book.  It's a pity, really.  Griffith has read, or at least looked at, a great deal of material on tactics and combat.  There are times it looks like he might have very interesting and important things to say about men in battle, if he allowed himself to think clearly.  As it is, the only useful part of the book is the notes and bibliography.  You can learn some truths about tactics from the information there.  Pity that Griffith didn't.	2004-02-04

He knows a great deal about the international history of socialist movements, and boils it down expertly.

Walter Russel Mead shows us a new way of looking at the history of the U.S. in the world.<br />Mead contends, convincingly to me, that there are four traditional schools of U.S. foreign policy, which he names for their best known practitioners.  These are the 'Hamiltonian,' which aims to make the country prosperous and powerful; the 'Wilsonian,' which believes our duty and interest lie in spreading our values overseas; the 'Jeffersonian,' which aims to keep USAmerica free, limit the govt., and avoid war at almost any cost; and the 'Jacksonian,' which is a bunch of barbarians whose motto is &quot;Don't tread on me!&quot;<br />As a thoroughgoing Jacksonian myself, I was surprised at the insight and sympathy the Jeffersonian Mead uses in describing all four schools.  More importantly, he has a good idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the four approaches, of how they complement and contradict one another, the way they sometimes ally with and sometimes oppose each other, and how USAmerican foreign policy has usually been a blend of ideas from different schools.<br />The book it has its flaws (e.g., Mead doesn't realize the continuing presence of the Marxist school in shaping the debate; he also fails to see that most of the debate about missile defense is not about technical feasibility, but whether the making it harder to nuke the U.S. is a good or bad idea), and it was published just before the Sept. 11th atrocities changed everything.  Still, I think this work will change the way USAmerica thinks about foreign affairs.  And it should.<br />Highly Recommended.	2003-07-21

Taken from the FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL, it says &quot;I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security analysis in order to find superior value opportunities.  This was a rewarding activity, say, 40 years ago, when Graham and Dodd was first published; but the situation has changed . . . [Today] I doubt whether such extensive efforts will generate sufficiently superior selections to justify their cost . . .I'm on the side of the 'efficient market' school of thought.&quot;<br />What Graham actually said at the end of that passage was &quot;TO THIS LIMITED EXTENT, I'm on the side of the 'efficient market' school of thought.&quot;  Kind of changes the meaning, no?<br />And what else, if anything, did Graham say in that magazine?  He outlined five simple methods of finding stocks that are likely to beat the 'efficient' market.<br />This sums up about 50% of what's wrong with this book: the 'evidence' is heavily selected.  You don't get enough information to make an intelligent judgement on whether something he quotes or cites is valid, or even if it really says what Malkiel claims it does.<br />Related to this is Malkiel's failure to discuss alternatives.  He says (p. 250) that buying and selling on short term momentum is no good, because the transactions costs eat up the profits.  Probably true.  But any time you're going to buy or sell anyway, the transaction becomes 'free': you can decide to act now or wait a few days and get a better price.  Malkiel doesn't mention that.<br />Nor does Malkiel ever point out that pension and mutual funds, as a group, CAN'T beat the market, or even keep up with &quot;the averages&quot;.  The funds are so large that for practical purposes, they are the market.  And the averages are just numbers. They don't pay management fees, taxes, or commissions.<br />Similarly, Malkiel says the knew the dot.com bubble would burst,because it had the classic signs of out of control market mania.  He was afraid to sell short, though, because he didn't know when.  OK, but knowing that certain stocks are certain to be bad investments in the long run means you can improve your investment performance by not buying them.  Again, that idea isn't mentioned.<br />Another problem is that there's no way to refute any of Malkiel's hypotheses, because he keeps changing the rules.  When a study allegedly shows that future earnings and dividends can't be predicted, that's evidence that the market is efficient.  No further comments needed.  But when studies show that buying stocks with low P/E and low P/S ratios consistently beats the market over various periods, he'll argue with it endlessly: it allegedly didn't work for a few years in a certain period; it didn't look at bond prices; it might have involved excess risk.  (Actually, the risk was measured, and it turned out to be lower than average for the market.  But he doesn't mention that).<br />In short, the evidence will show the market is 'efficient' because Malkiel won't allow the hypothesis to be refuted.<br />Finally, the book is intellectually incoherent.  For example, Malkiel suggests you find stocks that are likely to grow faster than average, but have relatively low P/E ratios.  Not a bad idea, but if the market is efficient, there shouldn't be any way of locating them.<br />Part Four of this book has some generally good advice for investors, which is why I give it two stars.  But it doesn't tell you the whole story.  Read Ben Graham's THE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR, James P. O'Shaughnessy's book WHAT WORKS ON WALL STREET, David Dremen's CONTRARIAN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, or Ken Fisher's SUPER STOCKS, to see some of the evidence that Malkiel distorts and omits.<br />And when it comes to investing, don't trust anyone blindly.  Especially Burton Malkiel.	2003-06-19

If you knew nothing else about the case, the fact that Hiss's defenders lied so often would tell you he was guilty. (For that matter, anyone reading Hiss's testimony, with it's carefully worded replies that sounded like answers, but, on examination, turned out to be legally meaningless, should have known that Hiss was desperate to hide the facts). <BR>\\"A Reader\\" says: <br />'At first W. Chambers claimed that Alger Hiss and others were secret Communists whose purpose was to influence policy.' Actually, the first time Chambers ever told anyone in the govt. about his actions (Sept. 3rd, 1939; to Adolf Berle of the State Dept.), Chambers said he was a spy, a fact Berle recorded in his diary and notes of the conversation. When Chambers didn't get immunity from prosecution, as promised, he stopped confessing to felonies. <br />Yes, Chambers was vague on when he left the Party. He had a lousy memory for dates. And Hiss got the year he \\"gave\\" his car away wrong by a year, and the season he \\"sublet\\" his apartment to Chambers wrong by months. Imperfect memory happens. <br />As for the documents Hiss passed, they were of great importance to the former Soviet Union (OOH! I just LOVE to type \\"former Soviet Union!\\"), which already knew it was likely to end up in wars with Nazy Germany and Imperial Japan. Contrary to the claim, almost all the documents had been routed to Alger's department (some had his initials on them to show he'd seen them, some were handwritten by him). Much of the information passed to the Soviet Union concerned Japan's war in China. The trade agreements concerned U.S. trade with Nazi Germany, a subject of considerable interest to the USSR. <br />As for the other microfilm, it was never claimed that Hiss had anything to do with passing it. And while much of it was worthless, some was excellent technical intelligence (for example, inertia starters for aircraft engines). It was passed by a contact of Chambers in the Navy Dept. <br />And the \\"life preserver\\" was not intended to be a legal document. It was a threat to use against the GRU if they found Chambers and tried to kill him, a 'leave me alone or I'll expose some of your spies posthumously.' <br />All the above, btw, has been part of the public record for decades. It was mostly covered in the earliest books about the case, and it was ALL dealt with in Allen Weinstein's PERJURY: THE HISS-CHAMBERS CASE, which I give my highest recommendation. <br />Oh, about THIS book: these are classic essays by people involved with varying aspects of the case, looking at it from many different personal and political views. They're hard to come by, and I'd read less than half in my years of studying this case. By all means, read this to see why the Hiss perjury case was important, then and now.	2003-04-17

In fact, he doesn't give you any hope at all.    Pryce-Jones's thesis is that the heart of Arab culture is an \\"Honor/Shame\\" ethic.  Those who live by it, he says, have one great overiding goal: to be powerful and respected in the eyes of others.  Any criticism is taken as an attack, and all effort is devoted to subjugating others.  There is no real basis for peace within Arab culture, or in the relations of Arabs with non-Arabs, for such a civilization is a perpetual war of all against all, the only question being how violent it will be at any given time.    Worse, reason is utterly impotent.  Pryce-Jones maintains that Arab civilization is certain it has all the answers.  If something is not working out the way it should, then that is because someone was plotting against the Arabs.  All the West can do is keep defeating them till their entire society disintegrates.    I hope Pryce-Jones is wrong, or at least exaggerating.  I fear he is not.  Regardless, this book's point of view needs to be considered.  It may be as bad as he thinks.	2003-04-17

The entirety of reality is mass-energy interacting.  Forget God, souls, and all that, they're illusions.'<br />Is this true?  Beats me, but it's worth saying plainly, because it's the view that informs Pinker's work.  He seems to think it has been proven true, scientifically.  Since it hasn't been, and probably can't be (How do you prove the non-existence of something? Especially an invisible something that may or may not exist in the first place!).  All this leads to some stupidities in the book, especially when Pinker is trying to deny free will while defending the importance of moral choice. If free will does not exist, we don't make moral choices.  Instead, we do what we do because we have to do it, and this includes talking about non-existent choices.<br />Now let's paraphrase something that Pinker does say clearly: 'Our personality, tastes, and other individual characteristics are mostly the result of our genes and chance.  Nuture pays very little part in determining who and what we are.'<br />Most of the book is devoted to outlining the scientific evidence that supports this conclusion, and it is massive.  Studies of twins and other siblings raised together and apart, of genetic boys raised as girls, and a GREAT variety of other work shows that we are largely 'hardwired' in personality, intelligence, tastes, and possibly even moral attitudes. Aside from the obvious (you grow up speaking the language your primary caregivers speak to you), how you are raised doesn't affect you very much (which is NOT to say it doesn't affect you at all, or isn't important).<br />Another thing Pinker states clearly: 'It's frequently claimed that nobody actually believes in the \\"Blank Slate\\" anymore.  This isn't true.  Most of them won't defend it openly any more, but they do believe in it.'  This is the historical section of the book, outlining the attacks on the idea of inborn human nature.  It's not as good as it could be -- many of the attacks on \\"sociobiology\\" were valid -- but it does show that the ideas Pinker is outlining here have been distorted and mocked by those with sometimes hidden agendas.<br />Pinker's conclusions would probably arouse little controversy if it weren't for politics.  There are vast belief systems devoted to the idea that we can make a better world by making better people, and that we can make better people by changing their enviornment (Libertarianism and Leftism come to mind).  Well, mostly we can't.  Anyone wanting to make a better world had best start with a clear-eyed view of inherited human nature, and either work within it or wait for genetic engineering.<br />In a few years, much of this will seem quaint.  By 2010, we'll probably be able to read, quickly and cheaply, anyone's genome.  After that, we'll correlate personality test results, IQ, and behavior against the genome, and we'll KNOW what genes are correlated with what mental characteristics.  And given the unvarying nature of our individual DNA, that will also be pretty good proof that behavior trait A is influenced in a predictable way by genes alpha, beta, gamma, etc.  The results, I believe, will largely vindicate Pinker.<br />Overall, Pinker does a good job of marshalling the evidence for inborn, genetically determined human nature.  It's essential reading if you have any interest in this subject at all.	2002-12-31

Beats me.  But Eric Lerner's hypothesis is certainly worth exploring.<br />Much of modern Cosmology rests on the postulated existence of &quot;cold, dark matter&quot; which can't be directly observed.  It is postulated to exist because it's supposed gravitational effects are observed.  Problem is, the 'gravitational effects' are assumed, by first assuming that gravity is the only long range force shaping the cosmos.  This has not been shown.<br />Mr. Lerner gets weird at times.  Part of his problem with Big Bang cosmology seems to be that it isn't Marxist enough.  Since Marxism isn't astronomy, who cares?<br />What is important is that the case for the Big Bang isn't nearly as sure as some would have it.  Read the book to find out more.	2002-12-04

Lots of good thoughts here, and an interesting historical account of the rise of various types of governance.  Unfortunately, when van Creveld talks about things I know about already, he gets a lot of them wrong -- for instance, p222, where he asserts that by 1939, 'every American' was 'issued his or her social security card', and that 'the Dept. of Health and Human Services had been created.'  HHS was created in the 1970s, under Carter, and to this day not every citizen has a Soc. Sec. card.<br />So if so many details are wrong where I know the facts, what about the places where I don't?

In fact, I know of two seperate sf novels written to 'refute' STARSHIP TROOPERS -- both of which fail because they never address its central concerns.<br />Neither is it a product of the Cold War, or a glorification of violence.  Heinlein, an Annapolis graduate, once gave a speech to the midshipmen in which he said that if the human race handled it affairs sensibly, then we'd never fight another war.  Unfortunately, he went on to note, we don't act sensibly all the time.<br />This book is about the times when things can't be handled sensibly.<br />It's also about infantry, the people who put their lives on the line in the worst possible conditions, to protect their societies.<br />It's the story of Juan Rico, a boy becoming a man.<br />And it's a philosophical treatise in fictional form, concerned with questions like \\"What is morality?\\", \\"How should a society be organized politically?\\", \\"How should we deal with criminals?\\", \\"What should the schools teach to preserve a free society?\\", and other things.<br />The philosophy is what drives so many people over the edge, because Heinlein didn't automatically assume either that we'd reached perfection in the modern world, or that we would.  This challenge to the conventional wisdom made lots of people half-crazy (The movie version is a good example.  Paul Verhoeven, the director just hated the book, and it shows throughout).<br />Heinlein asked fundamental questions, and some of the answers he came up with were wildly upsetting to many, e.g.: conscription is immoral under all circumstances; women should serve in combat, but not in the same units as men; the right to vote should be earned, not automatically awarded at age 18; corporal punishment is superior to locking people in cages like animals; we won't be able to abolish war in the forseeable future ('and I don't like that prediction any better than you', he wrote in an essay once).<br />But if you can read ideas you may disagree with without flying into a rage, then this book can be a real treat.  And it remains a great piece of storytelling.setting to many, e.g.: conscription is immoral under all circumstances; women should serve in combat, but not in the same units as men; the right to vote should be earned, not automatically awarded at age 18; corporal punishment is superior to locking people in cages like animals; we won't be able to abolish war in the forseeable future ('and I don't like that prediction any better than you', he wrote in an essay once).<br />But if you can read ideas you may disagree with without flying into a rage, then this book can be a real treat.

In fact, it's really three books.  <br />The subject of the first book is USAmerica's 'small wars': the minor conflicts with foreign powers, starting with the war against the Barbary Pirates, and continuing through the our Caribbean adventures in the twenties and thirties.  It's well documented and excellently written.  My only complaint is that it isn't longer and more detailed.<br />The second book is only a few chapters long.  It covers Viet Nam, and Boot's thesis is that our greatest military mistake there was that we DIDN'T fight it as a small war.  Had we done so, he believes we would have won, at a far smaller price than what we paid to lose.<br />No one can prove might have beens, but I find his argument convincing, and even those who disagree should find it intriguing and thought provoking.<br />Finally, there's the third book, which is policy prescription.  Here I really disagree with Mr. Boot.  Boot wants us to go haring around the world, civilizing the 'natives' with M-16s.  We tried this in the Phillipines, in Haiti, in the Dominican Republic, and in Nicaragua.  Boot recounts all these attempts to \\"Take up the white man's burden,\\" and by his own account, at least three were utter failures.  The only one that sort of succeeded was the Philipines, where we stayed over forty years, and ended with an ex-colony that isn't sure it likes us, tends to lapse into dictatorship, and suffers a revolt every decade or so.  For this we spent four thousand lives on our side, and tens of thousands on the Phillipino side.  This is success? <br />Mr. Boot would like us to do this again, in lots of places all over the world, because he thinks the 'natives' will be better off being conquered by us than ruling themselves.  Perhaps so, but I'm a USAmerican, and I think MY country would be decidedly worse off if we undertook these imperial adventures.	2002-08-07

The author looks like a man writing history, basing it on original sources. In fact, when the sources are checked, they've been distorted, or they just don't exist. The book is a pack of lies.<br /><br />Second, some people can't bear to admit that someone on 'their side' is wrong. With one exception (the reader from Carlisle PA), the only favorable reviews are from people who share the author's political objective of increasing U.S. gun control. Their point seems to be \\"Gun control is a good thing, so this author must be telling the truth, even if no one else can find the sources he says he cites.\\" There's lots of things to be said on both sides of the gun control issue, but making things up and passing them off as history won't help sort out the gun control controvery.<br /><br />Finally: praising a book full of lies as 'thought provoking', or claiming that 'only years of research will sort this out' is a good way to make yourself, AND YOUR CAUSE, look ridiculous. Whether you think gun control is a good or bad idea, one thing is certain: this book helped the anti-gun control movement immensely. The NRA should give the author a testimonial.  Handgun Control, Inc. should hire a hitman.<br /><br />For more than you may wish to know about the author's LIES, see: Lindgren, James. Fall from grace: Arming America and the Bellesiles scandal.

It gives an idea of what Islam did and did not accomplish, and has a nice list of references that point the way to more detailed sources.<br />  But there is one very strange thing about this book.  In the last chapter, Lewis asks why Islam lost the economic and political power race to the West, and confesses he isn't sure why.  Yet his own previous chapters provide the start of the answer.  At some point in Muslim history, the culture decided to stop changing.  Research into the new became a crime.  This was a deliberate, conscious choice.  Lewis points this out in several places.  Surely it is obvious that if one participant in a race decides to stand still, while the other keeps moving forward, the second will eventually pass the first?<br />  The question \\"Why did Islamic civilization decide to stop learning new things?\\" is one I can't even begin to answer.  But this book makes it obvious that Islam did make that decision.  Until the Muslim world reverses it, the disparity between them and the West can only grow.	2002-06-08

This book continues the series that started with HOW FEW REMAIN, and continued with the GREAT WAR trilogy.  In the series so far, the South won the First and Second Wars Between the States, thanks to the interference of France and Great Britain.  This drove the North into the arms of Imperial Germany. Together, and helped by the Red Negro revolt in the South, they beat the British/French/Confederate side in the World War.<br />But nothing fails like success.  The public is war weary and crying for reform, the conquered Canadians are restless, and the South is suffering the agonies of defeat.

Molotov was one of the most evil, ruthless human beings who ever lived, and if there's a Hell, he's in it.  For forty years he helped make sure the Communist Party ruled the Soviet Union, whatever the price -- and that price came close to including his own life, and that of his wife, along with the millions he helped Lenin and Stalin murder.    In the eighties, Felix Chuev had a long series of interviews with Molotov, and they form a fascinating picture of life on the inside of the Soviet Empire.  Molotov was a true believer in Communism right till the end, ready to justify anything if he thought it would preserve the Party's power.  He still loved Stalin, and said so, while admitting that he and his wife were nearly murdered by the paranoid old tyrant.  'It was necessary,' he says.    And in a weird way, he was right.  Marx's grand vision was that capitalism would industrialize the world, but the workers would hate it and destroy it.  Wrong!  The workers were interested in better pay and better working conditions, not running the country.  And Marx never had a plan for running the economy after the revolution -- somehow, the workers would solve all problems by unanimous agreement.    When the Bolsheviks seized power, they nearly destroyed Russia's economy.  Facing collapse, Lenin re-instituted a form of capitalism (the New Economic Policy) to buy time to consolidate the Communist Party's rule.  But by the late twenties, the NEP had done all it could.  The All Union Communist Party (Bolshevik) had to either give up power and go to full capitalism, give up growth and be conquered by Germany, or build industry on the bones of the masses.  Stalin saw this, and chose to murder millions rather than admit that capitalism just works better.  Molotov was his chief henchman in these policies, and he's dead right that without them, Soviet power couldn't have survived.    But even with them, it couldn't survive.  The only way a Communist society can work is by one man rule and periodic bloodbaths.  But in order to preserve that rule, the dictator has to slay all successors able and ruthless enough to take his place.  So invariably, the Great Killer's successors are mediocrities, and the totalitarian system rots from within.  It will happen in China before the 2020s are out, and in Cuba by the 2030s.    All students of Russia and the former Soviet Union (and I still LOVE to type 'former Soviet Union') should read this book and see what is necessary to hold the kind of power Lenin and Stalin did, to achieve what little they achieved, and why in the end it still had to fail.	2002-01-12

In 1955, Rudolf Flesch published WHY JOHNNY CAN'T READ: AND WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.  It was almost universally condemned by teachers, but parents praised it and it became a huge bestseller.    Because the controversy Flesch started wouldn't go away, Jeanne S. Chall was commissioned by a foundation to study all available evidence on teaching children to read English.  She reviewed all published studies, visited classrooms in both in the U.S. and Britain, and came to an unambiguous conclusion: begining reading instruction works best when it concentrates on \\"code-emphasis\\", otherwise known as phonics.    In the eighties, Chall published an updated version, reviewing all research done since her first edition.  Conclusion: phonics works best, and the improvement in reading scores since the mid-sixties was due to the increased emphasis on phonics.    In the late nineties, yet a third edition.  Conclusions: the de-emphasis on phonics since the eighties had led to a deterioration in reading scores.  All available evidence showed that only phonetic methods work for reading teaching.  The alleged evidence disputing this was methodologically unsound, and worthless.  Phonics is the only way to go.      THE GREAT TRAGEDY OF READING INSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES IS THAT SOME PEOPLE, FOR POLITICAL/IDEOLOGICAL REASONS, REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THESE FACTS, AND FREQUENLY LIE ABOUT THEM.  THEY DO PHONY 'STUDIES' THAT DON'T MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF READING INSTRUCTION, THEN USE THEM TO 'PROVE' THAT PHONICS DOESN'T WORK.  THEY ALSO TAKE NON-PHONETIC METHODS AND CALL THEM PHONICS, SO THEY CAN FOOL CONCERNED PARENTS.    If you want to find out what phonetically based reading teaching IS, and whether your children are really being taught phonetically, get a copy of this book and read it.  If you then find out they aren't being taught properly, you have two choices: 1) use Flesch's book, or Diane McGuinness's WHY OUR CHILDREN CAN'T READ, and use them to teach your child, or 2) buy Roberta Pournelle's (Mrs. Jerry Pournelle)'s computer program, and use it to teach your kids to read.    Btw, Flesch, McGuinness or Pournelle also work for adults with reading difficulties.	2002-01-07

If you read this book in the wrong frame of mind, you won't like it.  The wrong frame is to believe that it consists of honest reporting about the U.S. health care system, and the Clinton health bill of `93.  It's mainly not reporting.  It's advocacy.<br /> The key is found in the intro, where the authors define \\"The System\\" that rules USAmerica -- which includes the Presidency, the Congress, the media ...  AHH!  The fact that they think the media is part of the govt., just not elected, is itself worth the price of this volume.  <br /> Taken in this vein, it is quite good.  We must have a national health system like a European country's , because ... well, because they feel embarrassed that we aren't like Europe.  That the U.S. was settled, predominantly, by people who WANTED NOT TO LIVE IN EUROPE is unimportant to Johnson and Broder, who know better than to take the this self-govt. nonsense seriously.<br /> What is serious is that the USAmerican public rejects 'socialized medicine.'  So instead Clinton wrapped it up in his mess of a bill, and then tried to scare us into panic over our health care, saying the system would collapse if we didn't give control of it to the govt.  Not true, and Johnson &amp; Broder know it, but hey, can't let truth stand in the way of ruling.<br /> Frequently THE SYSTEM is unintentionally funny, too, as when the authors take a break from reporting the `horse race' political aspects of the story to criticize the media for concentrating on the `horse race' instead of the policy substance, after which they trash the only attempt ever made to discuss the policy substance (Elizabeth McCaughey's famous piece in The New Republic) and go back to reporting the horse race.  You sort of wonder if they read their own manuscript.<br />  But have some sympathy.  They do mention the policy substance from time to time -- our rulers think we spend far too much money on foolish things like attempting to save the lives of premature infants.  Those resources should go to more important things, like health care for \\"homeless, drug abusing gay and bisexual men of color.\\"  I mean, would you want to defend THAT openly?<br /> It's also very useful in assessing the nature of liberal bias in the press.  The last chapter of the hardcover first edition, on sale in 1996, told us about good Pres. Clinton's attempts to `save' the federal budget before runaway health care spending wrecked it, and evil House Speaker Newt Gingrich's attempts to `cut health care spending,' when in both cases they were trying to do the same thing -- cut the rate at which spending on health care would increase in the future.  That's one way you bias coverage -- describing things in such a way as to create the desired reaction, which in this case was to get us to run out and vote Democratic.<br /> The last chapter of this paperback edition mentions the Kassenbaum-Kennedy bill, passed by Congress and signed by Clinton. All mention of it was carefully left out of the first edition.  That's another way of biasing coverage -- leave out the `unimportant' stuff that might confuse the citizenry.<br /> And if you practice your critical thinking skills as you read, you will learn a lot about the chaotic way Clinton ran his administration, how the Democrats lost control of the House after twenty straight wins, why the bill was so complex, and other fascinating stuff.  <br /> What you won't learn  how the Clinton health plan would have worked, of course.  Obviously, they were afraid of your reaction if you found out.  That is probably the most important information in the book.	2001-06-21

The second is very good. This one is mediocre.<br />The problem is that Pullman has a Message: 'Have an Open Mind.' Unfortunately, none of the characters in THE AMBER SPYGLASS do. It never occurs to any of the 'Good Guys' to find out anything about the 'Bad Guys' on their own, to doubt anything they're told, or to use their brains to independently evaluate the evidence -- but then, they never bother to get any evidence.<br />And what the author does show us of the 'Good Guys' suggests they're as evil and ruthless as the baddies.  So who cares who wins?<br />A lot of the reviewers suggested that this series is &quot;better than J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.&quot;  Hah!  THE GOLDEN COMPASS was better than Rowling, and THE SUBTLE KNIFE was almost as good, but THE AMBER SPYGLASS isn't even close.<br />It's a pity.  Pullman had the makings of a great series here, but he threw it away in order to deliver a lecture about 'thinking for yourself.'  Too bad he doesn't practice what he preaches.	2001-06-09

Lots of reasons.<br />          First, read BEFORE THE STORM for it's look at the origins of the modern political era.  When the polls closed on Election Night '64, the Democrats had just won the Presidency for the seventh time in nine elections, and they held huge majorities in both houses of Congress.  The experts debated whether the Republican party could survive, but all agreed that the Conservative movement was dead as vaudeville.<br />        Within two years, the Republicans came roaring back in Congress and the state capitols, and the Conservatives held veto power in the Party.  The GOP won five of the next six Presidential elections, captured the Senate in the eighties and both houses of Congress in the nineties, and the only Republican presidential candidates to lose were two incumbents who had shown themselves as not conservative enough for the fire-eaters. Who ordered this?<br />        Perlstein shows how the charges that blew apart the consensus were laid.  He follows the people who were determined to create a Conservative movement, and shows how they eventually succeeded in forcing their champion, Barry Goldwater, into running for the office he didn't want.<br />        BEFORE THE STORM also shows us how crazy politics can make people.  It's jaw dropping to read of Clarence Manion's efforts to make Orville Faubus into the standard bearer of Constitutional govt.  Faubus arguably should have been hanged for treason!  <br />        And how many of knew that Barry Goldwater was either a totally incompetent politician, or he deliberately sabotaged his presidential effort?  The story of Goldwater's '64 'campaign' is a near-perfect record of doing the wrong thing.  Yet it didn't matter.  Goldwater did the three things necessary to birth the modern Conservative movement: he ran, he allowed Clifton White to organize the volunteers who would take over the Republican party, and he introduced the politician who knew how to reach the people: Ronald Reagan. (My wife, hearing Reagan give &quot;The Speech&quot; for Goldwater, wished she could vote for Ronnie for President instead.  Took a while, but ...)<br />        It's also illuminating to watch LBJ and his sanctimonious minions attempt to frighten the public into believing Goldwater was a madman who'd get us involved in a war, while secretly planning to do it themselves.  How could so many, including me, be taken in by that fraud?<br />        Well, reading Perlstein, we're shown how easy it is to miss what's important.  The public didn't know what Johnson would do, and the pundits had no idea a Conservative tidal wave would sweep away New Deal politics.  Remember that the next time some television gas bag confidently predicts the future, or candidates assure you they'll never do 'X'.<br />        BEFORE THE STORM also reminds us of things we prefer to forget or deny, such as the way Goldwater and others abandoned principle to appeal to racists.  As a Known Fascist, I hang my head in shame for what we compromised with.<br />        But most of all, read BEFORE THE STORM for a great piece of objective history.  No one will fail to realize that Rick Perlstein is a Leftist who disagrees with almost every political position Barry Goldwater ever held.  But he hardly ever lets his point of view get in the way of explaining his subject's viewpoint.  <br />         Occasionally, Perlstein stumbles. His claim that Walter Knott got rich off Big Govt. is just silly, and his criticism of western water projects not much better.  I could also wish he'd bothered to read books like McCARTHY AND HIS ENEMIES, instead of relying on summaries by hostile critics, or concentrated more on how liberal Democrats like Reagan and Charleton Heston became conservative Republicans.  But far more often, he gets inside the heads of those he profiles, as when he tells of the white South's genuine fear that ending racism would also mean ending everything good in Dixie's distinctive subculture.  I'm impressed.           I look forward to reading future books by Rick Perlstein on any subject, and only hope that my eventual work on Robert Oppenheimer and his times can be as insightful, thorough, and above all, honest.  I may even delve into (shudder) THE NATION just to read his articles.  <br />Highly recommended.	2001-06-09

It was, and is, the best novel I've read in the last thirty odd years.  But this sequel doesn't measure up.<br />It's not that it's bad.  It's really quite good.  I enjoyed reading it, and I recommend it.  I think the new character Will Parry is very well done, the worlds he &amp; Lyra explore are fascinating, the Angels are intriguing, and the story advances.  But ...<br />At the end of THE GOLDEN COMPASS, Lyra 'Silvertongue' Belacqua had seen Mrs. Coulter and her allies doing immense evil, while Lord Asriel, Mrs. Coulter's one-time lover and current rival had cold-bloodedly murdered a child for his Cause.  Lyra, and the author, seemed equally outraged at both of them, and Lyra vowed to oppose both's efforts.  But THE SUBTLE KNIFE begins to take sides between these two villians, and does so without any reasons being given.  I can't see any moral difference between them, or why so many automatically trust one side but not the other.  Also, some of the people who clearly seem to be intended as 'good guys' don't strike me as at all admirable.<br />And where THE GOLDEN COMPASS was near perfectly plotted, THE SUBTLE KNIFE has several clunkers, e.g. the way in which one major character dies stupidly.<br />It's not given to many authors to write a multiple masterpieces, but THE SUBTLE KNIFE fails to do justice to the book that preceded it.

Then, in the 18th century death rates started to come down -- in Europe. There followed a population explosion -- among whites.<br /> Somehow, this failed to worry white people. Instead, they used their wealth and numbers to conquer the world. Everything was fine by them till about 1946, when the non-whites began booting out the conquerers, and those pesky colored babies stopped dying at the rates they had in the past.<br /> VOILA, a population explosion was discovered. 'Human Beings' were present in far to great numbers, and catastrophe was just around the next corner, unless drastic steps were taken to stop population growth among the dusky ... well, the corner after that. Or maybe the corner six blocks down. Or somewhen.<br /> THE POPULATION BOMB is the best known of these false projections. ...it displayed on its cover the ridiculous assertion that \\"In the time it takes you to read these sentences, four people will die of starvation. Three of them children.\\" But if you're scared of the brown peril, you don't bother to time how long it takes to read that, then compare the figures and find out it wasn't true.<br /> If you want a text book in how NOT to think about population trends, or how to frighten the gullible, or how some people will cling to their beliefs despite every piece of evidence, by all means buy a used paperback somewhere.<br /> If you want to know something about population trends in the real world, forget it. ...	2001-05-27

As a secret member of the Communist Party and espionage agent, he could tell a whale of a story.  As someone who watched the rise and fall of American and Soviet Communism, he might reflect on what happened, and why a movement that once looked so succesful fell apart.  If nothing else, he might at least have told some interesting lies.<br />He doesn't.  <br />Instead, he spends over three hundred pages carefully avoiding the main themes of his life: what he really did as a Communist, why he felt it necessary to conceal his membership in the Party, what it was like inside the Party, and what, if anything, he learned from it all.  <br />The advanced student of communist propoganda will learn a few things, and those who know of Abt from Elizabeth Bentley's and Whittaker Chambers memoirs, the Venona decrypts, and other sources can glean a few interesting facts here and there, but mostly, Abt says nothing about himself, his life, his movement, or his century, and takes three hundred pages to avoid saying it.<br />A wasted life, and a waste of money.

This is the first book in a series that I liked a lot, but many didn't.  If you're not prepared to take this series  on its own terms, don't bother.<br />The premise is that in May, 1942, just as  the human race is getting ready for some serious mutual bloodletting,  invaders from another star show up.  These are the Race, known to humans as  'the Lizards', a species that has developed VERY slowly and patiently, and  has conquered two other inhabited worlds.  Both the alien races the Lizards  have previously encountered were much like them.  Humans aren't.<br />The  Lizards have only sublight travel, and last surveyed Earth during the  Crusades.  They expect humanity to have advanced as much in 800 years as  they or the other conquered races would have -- that is, barely at all.  So  they deploy their supersonic fighters and tanks, ready to roll over knights  on horseback, and run smack into armies that are outclassed in some  respects, and fully competitive in others.  <br />A big factor determining if  you'll like this series is whether you're willing to buy into the premise.   You could say that these books are highly artificial -- let the Race arrive  in 1932 and they'd walk over humans, let them show up in 1952 and they'd be  nuked before they got a foothold.  Or you can say 'the Race' is carefully  contructed.  Turtledove obviously started with the idea of an invasion  during WWII that would be neither a pushover nor doomed, and the Lizards'  characteristics follow logically from that plot requirement.  As it is,  humanity and the Race are &quot;In the Balance,&quot; just matched to each  other.  This delighted me, but it clearly annoyed some of the  reviewers.<br />The other big factor in deciding whether you'd like this  series is pace and scope.  The story develops a bit slowly, and not  everyone will like following dozens of characters scattered over the globe  as they make their separate decisions to fight or cooperate with the  invaders, and try to stay alive in a world turned upside down.  Also,  things won't be resolved quickly, any more than the real WWII was over in a  few months.  Again, this annoyed some, but left me with lots to look  forward to.<br />The &quot;World War&quot; series develops over four books,  till the humans and the Race reach temporary balance, and continues in the  &quot;Colonization&quot; series, when the aliens main settlement fleet  finally arrives.  If you want everything settled in one novel, this is  definitely not for you.  If, like me, you enjoy following dozens of  characters spread through years and continents, you'll probably like this  series.<br />Turtledove's characters are mostly well drawn, and the plotting  fairly tight.  His knowledge of history shows, and I mostly believed his  assessments of how Hitler, Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt would have  reacted to these events. There are some things I would have insisted on  changing if I was his editor, but overall I liked all four of the  &quot;Worldwar&quot; series, and eagerly await the third volume in the  &quot;Colonization&quot; series.	2000-06-25

Since then I've raced through Lois McMaster Bujold's series about Miles  Vorkosigan, watching the manipulative dwarf go from military school reject  to Imperial Auditor, the second highest political position on his world.   I've followed him through desperate battle and political intrigue, and  enjoyed every page.    Now Miles Vorkosigan faces his greatest adversary --  himself.  He is hopelessly in love, and has a cunning plan to seduce the  object of his affections into marrying him.  It doesn't occur to him to she  might respond to a straightforward approach.      Meanwhile, his cousin Ivan is mixing up Miles's life for the fun of it; his clone brother Mark is  trying to get rich off 'butter bugs,' which would be the perfect food source if they weren't revolting; a Vor lord has discovered an unexpected  use for artifical wombs; a woman whose brother was a Vor noble is  attempting an end run around a male only inheritance rule; social change is  hitting the planet Barrayar very hard, people who thought they were 'progressive' are deciding they've had too much of a good thing, political  plot and counterplot goes on, ... WOW!    It's hard to summarize this novel, because I just want to describe one hilarious scene after another, such as the Dinner Party from Hell. Suffice to say I've read most of Bujold's  work, and this is her best ever.  A stunning change of pace, like nothing  previous in this series, and yet growing out of it naturally. My highest recommendation, whether you've read any of the stories of Miles or his parents before.      Science Fiction doesn't get any better than this.	2000-06-25
US	52217752	R276A2NPJRYHOL	0671036602	320736234	The Burning City	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Not what I expected -- or what the characters expected	Some time ago, Larry Niven invented his 'Warlock' universe, in the story \\"Not long before the end.\\" The premise is that magic works, but that it requires a natural resource, 'mana,' that was used up by human civilization before the begining of recorded history. THE BURNING CITY is set against that background. <br />I've always simultaneously enjoyed these stories and been depressed by them. For example, in the series the continent of Atlantis existed, but was techtonicly unstable, preserved by magic, and when the Atlanteans finally used up too much mana, it sank. In the long run, there's no hope for the societies and magical creatures that inhabit this universe. The best they can do is to win their temporary local victories. But they usually do win those temporary, local victories, and the tales of how they do so are fine.<br />This novel, the first of a projected trilogy, is set in a city on the site of present day Los Angeles. Whandall Placehold grows up in one of the city's three peculiar social classes, discovers that there are better ways to live, and sets out to escape the trap his city has put him in, all with the best of intentions of course. It's rather a \\"slice of life\\" naturalistic novel, except that the setting is a rigorously imagined fantasy world. ... The theme of this novel is that violence and theft are bad for those who commit them, as well as the victims. Whandall's achievement is to recognize that the life he is born to is a trap, and his goal is to find a way to live honestly and peacefully.) <br />Whandall's fate turns out to be bound up with that of Morth, a wizard from lost Atlantis. The novel follows Whandall from childhood to early middle age, and the next book (already sold) will concern one of his daughters. I'm looking forward to it.<br />There's a satiric subtheme to this novel that I was a long time spotting, and what it satirizes is modern USAmerica. That seems to have gotten under a lot of people's skins, and they write reviews here\\"that make it seem like the book jumped off the shelves and attacked their children.\\" So fair warning: if you think that good intentions guarantee good results for society and govt. policy, this book will enrage you. But I don't think that way, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book, except for the depressing thought that in the end the civilization it depicts is inevitably doomed. I was captured by the story, I liked the characters, and I'll be rereading it. If the impending collapse of their civilization didn't bother me so, I'd have given it five stars.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-06-11

I haven't read anything by Stephen Baxter before, but after this I will.  They've produced a real winner here.<br />As they say in the afterword,  the idea of a machine that can see into the past and through walls is an  old one (I especially recommend &quot;E for Effort,&quot; by T. L.  Sherrard, if you can find an old copy of the ASTOUNDING SCIENCE FICTION  ANTHOLOGY).  Clarke and Baxter managed to make it new and different.<br />The  key to their achievement was to anchor it to a rigorously imagined physics.   The &quot;wormhole camera&quot; turns out to have uses and implications  that its inventors don't expect, and it leads off in many strange  directions.  <br />I don't want to give away surprises, but I started this  book expecting to be able to predict everything that would happen, and I  was repeatedly taken by surprise.<br />There are a few flaws in this novel  (for instance, the POW camp scene, which apparently has no purpose  whatsoever), but almost everything is topnotch.  The characters are mostly  believable, the future world is interesting, and the ending was a delight.   <br />Highly recommended.	2000-06-11

Somewhere along the line, he got the idea that Adolf Hitler had to be dishonest in all circumstances.<br />So when Hitler claimed that he invaded Russia because  Stalin was about to invade him, and Viktor Suvorov supports it in his  brilliant book ICEBREAKER, Gorodetsky finds it necessary to dispute the  idea.  Otherwise, I guess, G. couldn't condemn the Nazis' mass murder in  Russia.<br />Go figure.  It's obvious Hitler would have invaded eventually.   But what was Stalin planning at the same time?<br />Unfortunately, the  evidence doesn't support Gorodetsky's arguments that Stalin had no  intention of invading Germany, that he wanted peace, that he was willing to  cooperate with the West, Hitler or anyone.<br />G. boasts about using new  information, but much of what he quotes is from the period before the  collapse of the Soviet Union, when Russian authors published what the State  wanted, or else, and foreigners had to guess at what had really gone on.  <br />G. claims to have seen various documents that are now in closed  archives, but since the entire document isn't published, we can't be sure  they're quoted in context.<br />And even when documents are available, the  Soviet Union of Stalin's time produced hundreds of tons of official  documents that had no relationship to reality, such as confessions to  crimes the interrogators knew had never happened.<br />Nor is everything in  the documents, even if we could see them all and separate out the  deliberate lies.  Stalin was good at keeping his own counsel, and changing  course without warning.   <br />G. uncritically repeats various Soviet claims,  e.g. that the Red Army troop deployment in June 1941 was meant to be  defensive.  But the Soviet  deployment then made no sense for defensive  purposes.  In fact, it was a mirror image of the Wehrmacht's just before  the German attack!<br />G. tends to make his own assumptions without  sufficient thought.  He says thatStalin's foreign policies weren't  ideologically driven.  His evidence is that Stalin didn't pursue stupid  Trotskyite attempts to cause foreign revolutions in the twenties and  thirties.  But that was when Stalin was consolidating his power and  building up Soviet military strength.  When he got the chance after WWII,  he acted just like a committed Communist.<br />And G. knows this!  Many of the  criticisms I've made, he makes himself in other contexts.<br />The only good  things in this book are the translations and references to other sources.   There's a lot of information here that will be valuable for those doing  research on the unsettled questions, but its own answers don't convince.	2000-06-01

In the early days of the epidemic, it was rational to worry that AIDS might 'explode through the general population.'  Once the HIV virus was isolated, and a little known about how it spread, it became obvious that it  just wasn't possible.<br />Back in 1987, Michael Fumento wrote an article in  Commentary which told why the general heterosexual population was not at  signifigant risk for AIDS.  He thought everyone would be glad to know that  tens of millions of USAmericans would NOT die of an incurable disease  associated with incredible suffering.<br />Wrong.<br />Lots of people wanted  everyone at risk, or, at least, wanted everyone to believe that everyone  was at risk, regardless of whether or not it was true.  Fumento was  denounced, harassed, and, lied about for stating that most AIDS victims  would continue to be male homosexuals, IV drug users, women in a long term  relationship with men in the first two groups, and children of women with  HIV. <br />The terrible thing is, that, by saying &quot;Everyone is equally at  risk,&quot; those at high risk didn't get the information they needed to  protect themselves.  Thousands died in the U.S. because they were  deliberately misinformed about AIDS by those with political agendas to push  -- agendas they weren't willing to argue for honestly.<br />Thirteen years  later, the story continues.  Very few cases of AIDS are contracted  heterosexually, except for the women sleeping regularly with bisexuals and  drug users, and Fumento continues to be denounced.  Even people whom came  to agree with him, such as Gabriel Rotello, felt it necessary to say nasty  things about him -- things that weren't true, by the way.  And those whom  WANT heterosexuals to be at high risk for AIDS continue to claim Fumento  was wrong, as you can see by looking at some other reviews on this page.   <br />The one thing you won't see is facts to back up their assertions, for  the simple reason that there are none.  <br />Read this book if youwant a  fascinating account of how the truth about a terrible disease was  surpressed.  And check out Fumento.com to find out the latest lies being  spread about AIDS -- but only if you value the truth above political  correctness.	2000-05-29

Fischer traces the  distinctive folkways and religious influence of the four great waves of  English emigration to the American colonies, and shows how they combined to  make modern USAmerica.<br />I have 19th century immigrant roots, and have  never lived in the South or New England.  I can't therefore confirm or  dispute what Fischer and the various reviewers say about the distinctive  regional U.S. differences that persist there today, and how they go back to  the original English immigrants.  But as a modern USAmerican from  California, I can see the various strands that make up our general culture  in each of the four founding regions.  <br />This is a long book, perhaps a  bit too long, but I recommend it highly, and since discovering it I  automatically read any book Fischer produces.  I have yet to read a bad one  by him.  Now let's have further volumes in the series!	2000-05-25

I read THIS KIND OF WAR almost 20 years ago.  It stays with me as one of the best and most important books I've ever read.<br />Fehrenbach was, as another reader-reviewer says, too close to the story to write with the  objectivity he later displayed in his excellent histories of Texas, Mexico,  and the Comanches.  But that kind of detachment will show up in other  histories by different authors.  What Fehrenbach gives us is the view of  someone whom was there, and whom witnessed it all from the inside --  confusion, complacency, cowardice, stupidity, valor.<br />I'm very glad that  this book is so popular in the Army and Air Force.  I hope it continues to  be read, and learned from.  I just wish it were a standard high school  textbook, both to let our youth know why we should stay out of war when we  can, and what we MUST do when we are in one.<br />Not a perfect book, but a  necessary one for those whom would understand the nature and requirements  of war.	2000-05-22

GOOD DAY, SIR!&quot; and he turned his back on him).<br />Panshin demonstrates at length in this book that he doesn't like Heinlein, doesn't approve of his ideas, doesn't understand him, and thinks that Heinlein isn't a very good writer. How much of this opinion is personal animus, how much left-wing disapproval of a right-winger, and how much plain stupidity I wouldn't venture to guess, but to paraphrase the author of a review below, entitled &quot;Panshin in Dimension&quot; , it contributes very little of value to the study of Heinlein or his work. <br />I realize it is hard to be objective and insightful about someone you don't like, and it does have the occasional interesting insight into Heinlein's fiction, but mostly, it stinks.

By listening  to acutal violent people with some respect (instead of the  psychiatric  nonsense of deciding that anyone unlike a psychiatrist is automatically  insane), Athens came to a simple conclusion: violent people are violent  because violence works for them.  It gets them what they want out of life.   And the violent reach that conclusion by learning from the people around  them.<br />So far, so good.  I come from a poverty-stricken, violent  background myself, and what Athens found rings true.  But there's more to  it.<br />It's no wonder that many psyciatrists view violence as insanity, for  many violent people take huge risks for trivial gains -- or at least, that  is how most people would view it.  One has to wonder how these people view  life.  Athens never asks the kind of person who choses to deal with a rude  party guest via aggravated assualt &quot;Don't you think that was sort of  dumb?&quot;<br />Athens is apparently looking for a theory of all violence,  but his answer overlooks the question of how violence ever got started in  the world.  If violent individuals are coached into violence by other  violent individuals, who taught the First Violent Person how to  behave?<br />Rhodes also biases things when he test Athens's theory against  some famous murder cases.  Rhodes examines the Clutter murders recounted in  Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD, and tells us how Perry Smith, who killed the  Clutters, fits Athens's theory.  He leaves out the fact that Dick Hickock,  the other criminal, planned the crime, and included murdering all witnesses  from the begining, or that Smith went along with the idea of robbery but  didn't want to kill the Clutters.  Smith's decision to kill seems to have  had a large impulsive component, exactly what Athens's theory wants to  totally exclude.  <br />Of course, Athens isn't the only person to interview  murderers.  The FBI Behavioral Science Unit does it all the time.  But  because what the FBI has discovered doesn't fit Athens's theories too well  in some cases, Rhodes trashes them, and quite unfairly.<br />And despite  Rhodes's denial, there is evidence pointing to genetic links to violent  behavior.<br />In sum, you can learn a lot from this book, but it's the latest  contribution to the ongoing study of violent crime, not the final answer.	2000-01-17

Alfred C. Mierzejewski suggests that this was only true till late 1944.  After that, bombing  became devastating.<br />  In 1942 and '43, the U.S. and Britain attacked  arms factories and housing respectively.  The Germans kept fighting and war  production kept going up.<br />  In 1944, the Allies increasingly turned to  synthetic petroleum plants and the German transportation system.  The  result was a catastrophic breakdown in all areas of the German war  economy.<br />  We'll never know what would have happened if the railyards  serving the Ruhr's coal fields had been hit starting in 1940, but  Mierzejewski makes a good case that it would have seriously weakened  Germany much sooner, and quite possibly ended the war in 1944.<br />  This is a very good study, well worth reading and thinking about.  I  recommend it to all my fellow armchair strategists.	1999-12-23

He concludes  that bombing enemy homelands has seldom been effective, and in this I must  agree.<br />The book has one real flaw though.  The author is in love with the  phrases &quot;strategic&quot; vs. &quot;tactical&quot; bombing.  Because of  this, he deprecates the effects of the late stage &quot;strategic&quot;  bombing of Germany, because &quot;tactical&quot; bombing of some of the  same targets was taking place simultaneously.  But so what?

It's one of the few compliments I can pay them.  <br />The Schneirs wanted to believe that the Rosenbergs were innocent, framed by the U.S. Govt.  They wrote a book that 'proved' their  case -- if you didn't know enough about the Rosenberg affair to make an  independent judgement, and didn't think well enough to see through their  predjudices and pre-conceptions.<br />The Schneirs basic method is twofold:  One: when presented with a complex case, select only the evidence that  supports the story you're pushing; Two: when nothing to help you is  available, make it up. Examples: an exchange that goes on for several pages  in the trial transcript, involving the judge, two lawyers, and a witness,  that ends with the judge ruling against the defense but saying that the  defense lawyers can bring up the subject again tomorrow, when they have the  transcript of that day's proceedings [something the defense chose not to  do], is reduced to ONE sentence, designed to show a prejudice by the judge  that isn't there; when trying to explain how the investigation of the  Rosenbergs started, they claim, on no evidence, that Hoover believed in  Soviet atomic espionage because he thought the Russians were too stupid to  build the bomb on their own (actually, it was because decrypted messages  proved the former USSR [oh! how I love to type &quot;former USSR&quot;!]  had spies in the Manhattan Project, but those messages were the U.S.  Govt.'s biggest 'secret', known only to the FBI, NSA, and KGB).<br />In the  seventies, the FBI released its files on the Rosenbergs, allowing anyone  with the will to see that they'd been guilty.  The Schneirs refused to see.   In the Nineties, the National Security Agency declassified the Venona  files .  The Schneirs  finally threw in the towel and admitted what had been obvious for decades:  Julius Rosenberg spied for the Soviet Union.<br />If you are writing the  history of a controversial subject, I recommend this book as an example of  how to go wrong.  If you're interested in what really happened in the  Rosenberg Case, get THE ROSENBERG FILE by Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton,  in print and available.	1999-12-19

He takes you through the trial, day by day, discusses the strategy of the opposing sides, and makes a judgement -- the trial was  proper, and the jury was justified in coming to the conclusion that the  defendents were guilty.  He's also careful to warn you about the things you  can't know, such as the difference between reading what was said, and  seeing it yourself.  <br />The big flaw in this book is the lack of sources.   You can't always tell where Nizer got his information.  But unless you want  to wade through the trial transcript and briefs, this is the best  description of the process that led to the Rosenbergs' conviction.  It's a  fairminded, honest book, and I recommend it.	1999-12-19

Robert Butow's masterpiece was written to give you the  facts.<br />Butow went to Japan, interviewed the surviving leaders, read the  documents, and remembered that people don't always tell you the truth, or  even remember it.  When he was done, his considered judgement was that the  Japanese leaders themselves didn't know when they would have surrendered if  Hiroshima and Nagasaki hadn't been nuked.  <br />Butow lays out the inner  workings of the Japanese war cabinet, showing how a few men refused to face  the fact that Japan had lost World War II.  He tells how Japanese diplomats  overseas tried to get peace negotiations going, only to be undercut by  their own govt.  He describes the way the Allies tried and failed to  understand Japan.  <br />We'll never know what would have happened if the  atomic bombs had not been dropped.  But after reading JAPAN'S DECISION TO  SURRENDER, you'll understand -- if you're honest -- how the Japanese  leadership dithered away their chance to avoid the holocausts of Hiroshima  and Nagasaki, and why Truman felt he had no better option than using the  atomic bomb.	1999-12-19

Fletcher Pratt was determined to remind you that the Civil War was a WAR,  long and bloody and dramatic, with the issue in doubt from the begining  till very near the end.  And he emphasized that the Civil War was about  slavery and seccession, two political questions that it answered forever.   He wrote this history with the skills of a novelist and the passion of a  participant (Pratt's on the Union side, and no bones about it).  I first read this book in the sixties, and after reading a variety of other works, including James McPherson's one volume and Shelby Foote's three volume  masterpieces, I've never seen anyone that captures the essence of what happened and why like Pratt.

Because he's being taught in the wrong way, says Flesch, and he's right.  I know.  I was being taught that way in 1959, and I couldn't learn to read either.  What can you do about it?  Well if it's  your own child, teach them yourself, using phonics.  Flesch lays out a  comprehensive course, usable by anyone who can already read.  My mother  taught me with phonics (she had no training or experience in teaching, by  the way), and I quickly jumped to number two in my reading class.  But if  the question is, what can you do about the failure of our schools, the  answer is &quot;Nothing.&quot;  Here is the only place Flesch falls down.   This book was published in 1955.  After 44 years, the situation has only  gotten worse.  This is because the people running the public school system  want it this way, and the country's parents won't fire them all.  Sad but  true.

What there is  is an end to arguments -- yes, the infamous &quot;Duclos article&quot; was  written in Moscow, and intended to prepare the Party for the coming Cold  War; No, Stalin was not interested in friendship with the U.S.A; Yes, the  Soviet Union supported the CPUSA with extensive cash subsidies; yes, the  Party was a wholely owned subsidiary of Moscow.<br />I look forward to more  volumes in the Annals of Communism series.	1999-09-09

The author had the subject for a very good book here.  How was the Rosenberg case presented, by whom, for what purposes?  But she couldn't bring herself to write that book.  She'd have had to write about the use of the Rosenberg Case to justify Stalinism.<br />Instead, she wrote a book about  how evil the U.S. was, to resist Stalin, and how, as a part of that evil  effort, two innocent leftists named Rosenberg were framed for espionage and  executed.  Not that she actually believes that.  It's just that the truth  (they were guilty) is too painful.<br />Ms. Carmichael's book is fairly  laughable.  She tells us that &quot;of course&quot; the Soviet Union was  spying on the U.S and Britain throughout World War II, both in general and  in regard to the A-bomb project.  I guess were not supposed to think about  the Soviet Union's vociferous denials.  Then she refers you, for further  information, to a volume(THE ATOM SPY HOAX)that explicitly denies any such  espionage ever occured -- a book she terms &quot;well researched.&quot;   Then she'll remind us that in matters of espionage, you can never come to  any firm conclusions, just before tossing off yet another firm conclusion  of her own.<br />If you know enough about the Rosenberg case to tell when  she's wrong, or making things up, you don't need this book.  If you don't  know enough, you especially don't need this book.  <br />Students of the case  should go read THE FBI-KGB WAR or THE ROSENBERG FILE if they're interested  in what really happened.  And a serious author should write about the way  the Rosenberg case was used, and by whom, and for what purposes ... but to  do that, he or she will have to start by pointing out that the Rosenbergs  were guilty, and that there was never a reasonable doubt about  it.<br />Stephen M.

David Grossman's ON KILLING contains much information of great value.  The good parts are superb.  Unfortunately, there's a fair amount of dubious material too.<br />Grossman notes that many studies have shown that  most soldiers in combat will not spontaneously fire a rifle at an enemy,  and suggests that there is an instinctive barrier against killing our own  species in most people.  So far, so good, and the evidence he sites  convinced me.  But then he tries to apply this to all of military history,  with dubious results.  For instance, it never occurs to him that among the  reasons so many people using smoothbore muskets missed are 1)The muskets  had no sights; 2)The soldiers using them had no markmanship training -- in  fact, they frequently went into their first battle without ever having  fired their weapon at all; 3)It's always easier to shoot on the firing  range than on the battle field (naval gunnery in combat deteriorated  radically compared to pre-war practice).  Similarly, 1% of the fighter  pilots got 40% of the kills -- but considering that bomber gunners weren't  taught how to fire properly at attacking fighters till almost the end of  the war (see Geoffrey Perret's WINGED VICTORY), fighter training may have  been similarly bad.  And one reason so many of the abandoned muskets at  Gettsyburg had multiple loads may well be that the soldiers who double  loaded them were paniced, and the panic also led them to get killed, or  drop their rifle and RUN.<br />When he comes to the plague of violence in  modern urban USAmerica, Grossman is alarmed by violent video games and  movies, and their possible effects on our children.  An important subject,  and he may be right.  But I looked the movies he sees as dangerous (DIRTY  HARRY, FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH, etc.), and they didn't appear till after the  rate of violent crime had shot up.  Same with the video games.  Nor is  there much consideration of cross-cultural crime rates, even though  &quot;violent American movies&quot; (and even more violent Japanese movies)  are seen worldwide.  Why the wide national differences in crime  rates?<br />Further, while it's easy to see how a military training program  that teaches automatic reactive firing in combat is rather like a modern  video game, the high school massacres we've seen recently didn't occur as a  result of someone firing at an armed teenager, who then went ape.  They  occured because kids brought guns to school with the deliberate,  pre-meditated intention of murdering the unarmed.  Mass murder and serial  killing have existed throughout human history.<br />Still, even with these  reservations, I highly recommend this book.  Grossman has taken the first  good look at a subject that has been almost totally ignored.  I hope others  follow his lead.	1999-08-20

HA! Now that some of the archives of the ex-Soviet Union have been  opened (OH! How I love to type &quot;ex-Soviet Union&quot;!), it turns out  the whole thing was a con from begining to end. The reality: Stalin was  determined to make a deal with the Nazis from the word go.  He organized  the &quot;Popular Front&quot; as a cover for this, as a distraction for the  Great Purge, and, probably, as a means of getting Hitler in a war with the  West.  The details Koch presents would be unbelievable if they weren't  documented (for instance, Soviet Espionage assigned women to seduce and  marry selected non-Soviet writers, as a means of manipulating them in the  cause of propoganda!).

When Los  Alamos opened in March, 1943, Serber gave a series of lectures based on  that conference, so everyone would have a common frame of refernce for the  work to come.  They were then written up as Los Alamos publication #1,  classified Top Secret, and given to every scientist joining the project.   Here they are, with a nice introduction by Richard Rhodes, (author of THE  MAKING OF THE ATOMIC BOMB and DARK SUN: THE MAKING OF THE HYDROGEN BOMB;  both recommended), and extensive annotations by Serber, covering (among  other things) where they were right, were they were wrong, and how to  discuss nuclear weapons in front of the contruction personal without them  figuring out what you're talking about.

Though Sudoplatov sometimes  gets things wrong (not suprising when working from memory fifty years  later), he has a wealth of information on how Stalin's secret police  worked, and presents a chilling picture of the kind of people who thought  they were building a better world through mass murder.  After reading this,  you'll have better understanding of how so many Westerners could betray  their countries to the USSR, and why so many are still trying to pretend it  didn't happen.  This new edition has some interesting material that answers  criticisms made of the first edition, especially his claim that Los Alamos  director J.

In 1948, lawyer Alger Hiss made what was arguably the biggest mistake of his life: he sued Whittaker Chambers.  Chambers had publicly accused Hiss of having been a Communist Party member, Soviet spy, and agent of  influence.  Unfortunately for Hiss, Chambers had saved some of the material  Hiss passed him for transmission to Soviet Military Intelligence.  Alger  Hiss ended up in prison, was disbarred, and spent the rest of his life  trying to convince people a fantastic conspiracy had framed him.      In  1971, Hiss made a mistake almost as large: he let an honest man look at his  defense files.  Historian Allen Weinstein had previously believed that Hiss  was innocent.  But when he read what Hiss's lawyers said in private, and  what FBI agents had written J. Edgar Hoover, he found there was no  reasonable doubt possible anymore.  Hiss had spied for the Soviets, and  Chambers had usually told the truth to the best of his ability.  Chambers  had sometimes lied, but only when he attempted to minimize Hiss's guilt --  and his own, for Chambers had secrets about himself to protect, and a well  founded fear of being the messenger killed for bearing bad news.    PERJURY  is a fascinating account of two complex men, best friends who became mortal  enemies when one split with Stalinism, and the other remained faithful.   The lives of Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers would have been interesting  even if they had never met or publicly clashed.  Their long duel caught  them in \\"A tragedy of History,\\" as Chambers put it.  PERJURY  tells that story better than anyone before or since.  It's a masterpiece of  historical detective work.      When it was published originally, all but  the die hard apologists for Stalinism conceded Hiss's guilt. The new  edition has recently released material from the National Security Agency's  Venona decryptions, and the KGB's Moscow files that destroy even the  unreasonable doubts. My highest recommendation.	1999-02-07

My original review:<br />For reasons still unclear, President Franklin Roosevelt had a mental block about Communism. He just couldn't believe that the Soviet Union would spy on his administration. In the late thirties, his political enemies insisted on pointing out reasons to believe that the Soviets had in fact penetrated the govt. Thus began a long running political controversy.<br />By the seventies, this should have been settled. Weinstein's previous book, PERJURY, and Robert Lamphere's THE FBI/KGB WAR: A SPECIAL AGENT'S STORY had established beyond reasonable doubt that large numbers of USAmericans had been Soviet spies, particularly those exposed by ex-spies such as Whittaker Chambers and Elizabeth Bentley.<br />If you are new to the story, THE HAUNTED WOOD is probably the best introduction to the tale of Soviet espionage in the Stalin era. If you're one of the ones with unreasonable doubts, it will crush your last pretenses, because the KGB let Weinstein and Vassiliev look at some of their files, confirming the identities of numerous agents. But if you're one of those who has previously looked into this subject, there won't be much new. Worth reading, but no bombshells.<br />Afterword, 2002:<br />I've come to appreciate this volume more with time. There is valuable information here that I didn't notice on my first reading. And, as I said before, it is the best introduction to the subject of espionage against the United States by the former Soviet Union (and I still LOVE typing 'former Soviet Union.' ...)	1999-02-07

One of his prime exhibits was the AMERASIA case,  where what started as an espionage conspiracy suddenly, mysteriously  collapsed.  &quot;It's true,&quot; said the Right and the Republicans.  &quot;Nonsense you're all paranoids,&quot; said Democrats, liberals, and  the Left.  Now, thanks to Klehr and Radosh, we have the truth, and it is  stranger than anything either side ever suspected.  There were multiple,  independent, overlapping conspiracies, at AMERASIA magazine (to spy for  Stalin),in the State Dept. (to undermine FDR's China Policy), in the  Communist movement (to shape U.S. policy) in the Justice Dept.

For over thirty years, there was controversy surrounding the Rosenbergs' trial. We heard the evidence was faked, that the witnesses were unreliable, that there was a more than reasonable doubt as to the Rosenbergs' guilt. This is the book that settled all that for all rational readers. Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain thousands of pages of documents from the FBI files, as well as interviews with surviving major participants, and showed beyond any reasonable doubt that the Rosenbergs and Morton Sobell were guilty as charged, and fairly tried to boot. Since then, the collapse of the USSR and the release of the VENONA decrypts have provided additional proof they were right on all major points (this evidence is reviewed in the new introduction). A great work of scholarship, and a heck of a good true crime thriller.	1998-11-12
