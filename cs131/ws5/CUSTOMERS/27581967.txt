A quote from George Carlin, at the beginning of the first chapter, says it all, \\"If you're reading it in a book, folks, it ain't self-help. It's help.\\" Steve Salerno isn't offering help here; he's shining a light on a social habit we have pursued to our personal and collective detriment.<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts: The Culprits and The Consequences. Part one not only names the main players in the current crop of self-help gurus, but identifies the corrupting techniques we fall pry to. Part One is effective in its discussion of these subjects. Part Two starts off well with a description of victim-hood, but then broadens its focus too much. Not all of our ills can be skewered on the horns of victimization and empowerment.  Part Two overreaches.<br /><br />That criticism does not diminish my appreciation for the focus of this book. It is well written and its points are argued well. I would like to see a future discussion on our desire for self-help expanded into the arena of spirituality. Mr. Salerno has raised an important issue here.  I recommend this book to everyone who has sensed the failure of self-help. It's is up to each of us to see the difference between help and self-help.	2005-08-21

As good as the series was - and I think it was very good - the book is better. I was delighted.<br /><br />Origins takes us from the beginning of space and time to the origins of life, all in a conversational manner, never glossing over the difficult bits or controversies, but explaining each in the light of science. The authors have done a wonderful job taking such a large subject - there's no escaping it, the universe, space, and time are large subjects - and condensing them without trivializing the complexity and wonder of the subject.<br /><br />This book is for all lay cosmologists and I recommend it for high school general science courses too.	2005-08-21

Don DeLillo chronicles this mystery somberly, with black humor and aplomb in White Noise. A small town, a college, a career, a blended family, colleagues, unexpected occurrences, and the incessant hum of background noise from TVs, radios, supermarket speakers, overhead pagers, motors, sirens, vehicles, and a questioning mind, make up the ingredients of this engaging novel.<br /><br />I found this novel enjoyable like strong Turkish coffee: bitter and overpowering at first, but smooth and captivating with additional sips.  Each chapter seems simple with interesting personal insights, but they felt uncertain and disconnected until the main event of section two comes drifting forward with the intensity of evacuation sirens. I was drawn in to the intricacies of family life and the insecurities of an academic profession. I was jolted by the internal obsessions.<br /><br />I recommend this novel for its strong and straightforward characterization and its haunting narrative style. I shall read more, if not all of Mr. DeLillo's other works.	2005-08-21

It bent and thrust my imagination, often contorting it in plasmic swirls of confusion and delight. Rarely did I understand the terminology of geologic events or timescales. Yet, Mr. McPhee is able to make billions of years come alive and be wonderfully memorable on a sojourn from the Delaware Water Gap to the San Francisco Bay. Who'd have thought that 3,000-mile drive on Interstate 80 could be so interesting? Luckily, he did, and so do many geologists who went along to show him what's out there and where (and when) it came from.<br /><br />Jumping from tectonic plate movement, thrusting the Grand Tetons skyward, to a boy's life in the hills of Wyoming makes this large work sweet and palatable to the non-geologist like myself. I shall never traverse the USA again without marveling in the long history, not of a nation, but a planet.<br /><br />I recommend this book to lovers of landscape and their place in it.	2005-08-21

A 50% return on my investment in 45 days? Where do I sign up? Too good to be true? Well, you know what they say... We think we are smarter, more sophisticated people today.  Maybe so, but if we are, it's because we know about things like Ponzi schemes, or think we do.<br /><br />Mitchell Zuckoff provides the best detail yet, of the life and times of the man who gave his name to an illegal financial scheme, Charles Ponzi.  The narrative is straightforward and factual.  It's interesting, but a little dull. Charles Ponzi was a very charismatic man, very shrewd; think Donald Trump. This book provides many facts, but little in the way of emotional motivation.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone interested in human gullibility and the financial world. You won't learn a lot about either, but you'll have many facts about Charles Ponzi.	2005-08-21

They don't. They get as close to it as they think is safe, they pause, they make observations, then they turn and run.<br /><br />Being a storm chaser implies intent. It implies conviction, purpose, and desire.  When confronted by such a force of nature the depth of one's convictions becomes apparent and what appears can range from a vision of hell to transcendent bliss.<br /><br />Buddhist practitioners are storm chasers. The natural force they pursue is inside them. It is the very intent, conviction, purpose and desire, which cause them to chase in the first place.  As they get close to this internal force it may or may not feel safe, they may pause or they may not, they may make observations, they will turn and run. The intrepid come back and begin again.<br /><br />Dancing in the Dharma, by Sandy Boucher is the story of one Buddhist teacher, Ruth Denison.  She is a force of nature. You know this, you don't sense it, you know it, when you meet her.  Somewhere between the first ten seconds and ten minutes of being with Ruth you are pushed outside your comfort zone. You are pushed outside your envelope.  You are pushed outside the box the envelope came in. You want to turn and run. The intrepid stay.<br /><br />Learning meditation from Ruth is not sitting quietly cross-legged on the floor, although there is time for that.  It is experiencing the Dharma, the Buddha's teaching. It is experiencing the force, the force as manifest in a small wiry German woman born in 1922.<br /><br />Sandy Boucher is intrepid, she stayed for more than two decades. She is also a wonderful chronicler of this very dynamic and enigmatic woman, Ruth Denison. To practice with Ruth is not only experiencing the Dharma, but also learning, in bits and pieces, Ruth's life story. Ms. Boucher paused and observed. It is good for us she did.<br /><br />This is a biography of a contemporary Buddhist teacher, not an historical figure or a pop star.  This is the story of a survivor who went beyond mere survival. This is the story of a woman with an incredibly strong personality and a stronger faith and experience in spirituality.<br /><br />Sandy Boucher has beautifully contained this force of nature (the good, the bad, and the neutral) between the covers of a book. For those who have not met Ruth in person, this is a safe distance. It will tell you a marvelous, awe-inspiring story of one woman who found her spiritual calling. Those who have been with Ruth will find threads dangled before them tied together, but they will also know the feeling of being with this force, pausing, observing, then turning to face the force within.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all. And to spiritual storm chasers I suggest a pilgrimage to sage tussled Copper Mountain Mesa, in the Mojave Desert.  You may turn and run, but you'll have gained for the effort.star.

Belatedly, I would like to add my positive review of this fine work. We are all concerned with behavior and often look only at the outward indicators. In self reflection we often, perhaps mostly, look at our thoughts. Too often we view emotion as a bi-product of our thinking and behavior.<br /><br />Dr. Goleman in a very readable and thorough way brings emotion out to be on an equal footing with thought. His perspective is insightful and engaging. It is helpful.<br /><br />This work deserves its continued success as measured by sales. More importantly it succeeds as a wonderful basis for self-knowledge and reflection. I can say that I gained new insights from reading it and I highly recommend it.	2005-05-28

Rarely is a serious scientific work, like this, which is accessible to lay people, so engaging and personal, while maintaining its scientific rigor. This is work well done. Neurologists might only appreciate the topic of focus, the brain's frontal lobes, but Dr. Goldberg delivers it in an engrossing and engaging manner.<br /><br />There is a wealth of information here for both the lay and serious reader. I recommend this work for its comprehensive details and readability. Dr. Goldberg's personal accounts are a wonderful bonus.	2005-05-28

It was the coffee stain that first caught my attention. I was walking out of the bookstore and there sat a book with a coffee ring on it. I paused and smiled. The book looked like it came from my desk, coffee stain and all. I smiled at the yellow roadside sign with the red arrow. I had observed many of these as I crisscrossed the United States over the last several years. With all these associations, how could I not pause and begin reading?<br /><br />A few minutes later I walked out of the bookstore with a smile and the book under my arm. Here was a kindred spirit, a sojourner lost in his own country, navigating his way through all that was familiar and strange.<br /><br />Mr. Bryson encircles the United States in a large figure eight with Des Moines, Iowa in the center, as it should be. He covers every region of the nation, aghast and agape at what he sees. He describes it in dry prose punctuated by laugh-out-loud comments. Mr. Bryson is pithy and riotously funny.<br /><br />If you are not planning on traversing the byways of the U.S. soon, by all means read this book now. If you have a trip planned, hold off reading this. Have your own experience, then pick up this book and see how many times your paths crossed. You'll laugh out loud too.	2005-05-28

Emergence, as a scientific counterpoint to reductionism could be a dull subject in the hands of a less deft observer of the world. In the hands of Professor Morowitz the subject comes alive with scientific detail and a thoughtful perspective.<br /><br />Professor Morowitz divides the history of the universe, from the Big Bang until now, into twenty-eight sections, each representing a major emergence. The number is arbitrary but useful. Admittedly, the number of emergences is vast, but the need to keep this on a readable scale is what the author does well. Some sections are more detailed than others. Professor Morowitz admits to having more knowledge in one area than another. The section on chemical reactions is his forte. It's not mine, however, the author begs the reader's indulgence and it is easily given.<br /><br />This is a highly readable and insightful book on the theory of complexity. Taking emergence into step twenty-eight is a bold and welcome move. I recommend this work to all who take the long view and are in awe of it all.	2005-05-28

A Short History of Nearly Everything is a large topic to cover, although at one time or another we all try to sum it up. Here, Bill Bryson, a great humorist and insightful observer of all things personal tackles science, the world, and our current understanding of it.<br /><br />I came to this work after reading another of Mr. Bryson's works, The Lost Continent, and assumed it would have the same droll wit and keen insight for science that Lost Continent had for small town America. It does not. It's a pleasant read, but runs out of energy two-thirds of the way through and goes flat. It's not I think because Mr. Bryson ran out of pithy comments or unique insights. I think this work goes flat because at the core Mr. Bryson has a deep interest in figuring things out. He takes his subject too seriously.<br /><br />If you come to this work with different expectations than mine and you have a light hearted interest in science, by all means, please read this book. My lack of enthusiasm for this work will not keep me from reading Mr. Bryson's other books. I look forward to them.	2005-05-28

From the Big Bang to Life, from Copernicus to Lovelock, Professor Gribbin advances the theory of complex order from simple rules.<br /><br />A reader familiar with complexity theory may feel they have heard all this before. Professor Gribbin however takes a very mathematical approach to the subject and delivers am interesting and readable account of his subject.<br /><br />I recommend this work to serious lay readers (casual science readers may find the math daunting, although just appreciating the author's enthusiasm will be infectious) and to a general academic audience. The scope is vast but engagingly presented and readable.<br /><br />Throughout the work Professor Gribbin goes on tangents and then announces that it is out of the scope of the present work. I challenge the good professor to write a new work on just those tangents. I for one will be happy to read it.	2005-05-28

Happiness as a determining factor in economic decisions? Whose happiness, yours, mine? Well, yes, and ours. Richard Layard makes a convincing and in my opinion long overdue argument for making happiness a benchmark in our policy decisions, both public and private.<br /><br />This isn't just a pie-in-the-sky whimsical new age thought. Mr. Layard reasons from definable, measurable, empirical data. He's an economist after all. Having said that you might think this is a dense, gross-national-product-per-capita kind of tome. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Mr. Layard's style is conversational and easily accessible. It's slyly thought provoking. The footnotes and reference sections will enable anyone looking for more data to be even happier.<br /><br />I'm happy I read this book.

Simon Singh writes about the big topic - the origin of the universe - in a way that is comprehensive, engaging, and fun. He brings to life people and ideas in a highly accessible and readable manner.<br /><br />The history of cosmology is presented idea-by-idea, experiment-by-experiment, building a wonderful story of science and human imagination. Each scientific description is followed by a practical example elucidating the topic and keeping the material fresh. One such welcome example came for me as I began to fog over on Cepheid variability. My foggy interest was immediately enlightened by the analogy of a flashing lighthouse and its brightness. The book is filled with wonderful examples to back up the science.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone, lay or professional, of any age, with a general interest in the Big Bang theory, or in the history of the universe. You will not be disappointed. The `further reading' section will guide you to more information in any area that you find particularly interesting.  I applaud Mr. Singh's graceful writing style on a subject that has all too often been lost in arcane footnotes.<br /><br />Lastly, don't let the size of this work fool you. It's a breezy fun read.

It's an interesting topic to ponder: how do we know things in an instant? In fact this topic has been pondered for millennia and studied extensively for the last fifty years. There are wonderful philosophical, religious, and scientific works on this topic. The knowledge and insights available are both broad and deep. This particular book, Blink, The Power of Thinking without Thinking, does not add anything new or insightful.<br /><br />While reading this book I felt as if I were at a business reception and found myself engaged in a one sided conversation with a nice fellow who went on way too long about how the mind works. My mind works. And what my mind told me was find a waiter, get another drink, and excuse myself. Never ending anecdotes, no matter how well intended, embellish a point, but do not prove it or provide a deeper understanding. That's the way Blink is. I cannot recommend it because it sheds no new light on an old subject and there are better works on the mind and cognition.	2005-01-21

This book gives a strong presentation on how the political right rose to prominence  from the 1950s to now. The story is told by two men who were there & shaped the outcome. It's an insider's perspective I appreciate. It's an easy read, the way a walk down a gravel road in your bare feet is easy. Every once in a while you discover something sharp.<br /><br />The sharpness here comes not from insight, but from the same stinging barbs hurdled at liberals which, we all know, were thrown from the left. This all sounds and feels like a child's fight, \\"He started it first. NO! He did.\\" For me, it is a sad distraction.<br /><br />While the How is of great interest, I want to know the Why and the What. Why did conservatism feel it could not have a say in modern politics? It has to be more than, \\"Those nasty New Dealers wouldn't let us have a say.\\" And what exactly is it we are talking about? What do conservatives want that's different from liberals (& vice versa)? It's interesting to read how Schlafly defeated the ERA, but why and for what reasons.<br /><br />I am searching for more, from both sides. I am looking for common ground.

It is called the nobel eight-fold path. The eight steps are memorized by every person who hears of them and takes up meditation. But memorization is not enough. These steps must be cultivated. How? That is precisely the question Bhante Gunaratana takes up in his book, Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness.<br /><br />I recommend this book to experienced meditators, not to beginners. Why? Because it may be too subtle for the neophyte. That's presumptuous I know, but that is how I feel about the work. Bhante G is a very skillful writer. Given the subject could I have chosen a different adjective? His writing is in no way obscure or mysterious, but it is very subtle and a reader may too easily dismiss it.<br /><br />That said, this is a wonderful book describing the Buddha's eight-fold path and what the practitioner should consider with each step along it. I highly recommend it for novice to experienced meditators.	2004-11-17

This is the book which brought my meditation practice into focus and brought me to Theravadan Buddhism. I first read it just after it was published in the early 90s. I have reread it several times since, each time gaining more insight - literally and figuratively. I cannot make the claim that it will have the same effect on you, but as the Buddha might say, try it and see for yourself.<br /><br />I like the precision of Bhante G's writing. This work is far more than a transcript of spoken discourses, like many contemporary Buddhist books. It is specifically created to be read, absorbed, reflected upon and practiced.<br /><br />When I come across a work that effects me so strongly, inevitably I wonder if the writer is as good as his word. I traveled to West Virginia to sit with Bhante G and the other monks and lay people at his monastery. As intellectually stimulating as his book is, sitting with him in the meditation hall was sublime. The man is a true living Buddhist master. He's a great writer too. Read his books.	2004-11-16

I was drawn to this book because of an interview I saw on television with the author, Rev. Rick Warren. His natural, easy-going sincerity drew me in. So I went out and bought his book. I have to admit, I didn't know a thing about this book except what Rev. Warren and the interviewer discussed. I haven't looked at a book best-seller list in years. In fact, I have been living in a monastery.<br /><br />Right off I have to say, if you are the least bit interested in or attracted to this book, by all means read it. It is well intended. I recommend it for that alone. Now, having said that, I have to give my criticisms. Despite statements to the contrary and using God as a primary source, this is a self-help book. It follows an all to familiar self-help pattern: you are down, you can be up, this is how, follow these tenets, don't look back.<br /><br />As for the purpose, it is a feedback loop of worship, ministry, evangelism, fellowship, and discipleship. A very contemporary Protestant message. I think Martin Luther had something different in mind for the Reformation.<br /><br />Having said that, I can not, nor would I try to, refute any individual's insistence that this book has changed their life. I am sure it has. Most self-help books are like diets though, well intended but rarely successful. I think that is the fate of this book too, despite its pedigree.	2004-11-16

Mingling a western life with eastern philosophy can lead to a bouillabaisse of heartburn and disappointment. Not so here. Wes Nisker's book, Buddha's Nature brings the insightful depth of Buddhist teachings to the skeptical/rational western mind in an enjoyable and profound manner.<br /><br />Experienced meditators will like this book for it's breezy western tone while staying on Buddhist point. Folks new to meditation will like this book because it's thought provoking without being pedantic. There are exercises in the book which, if practiced by a new meditator, will provide a great foundation for the time when you sit with a teacher.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone interested in meditation and Buddhism. There is an old rule in meditation though: for every minute you read about meditation, spend ten minutes sitting in meditation.	2004-11-16

I approached this book thinking it was titled Rational Spirituality. That's my mistake, not the author's. I was expecting a rational discourse on metaphysics and religion. Given John Horgan's access to the best and the brightest in the scientific community, I was expecting an all-or-nothing assault on transcendent issues. My mistake.<br /><br />This is a fine book if approached without expectations. I do highly recommend it to folks interested in altered states of consciousness. Mr. Horgan imposes himself more here than in his other works. That's okay, but I didn't really need the details on the drugged out pow-wow. Ingesting something that makes you throw up to achieve a mystical state is so 60s. What did Barry McGuire sing in \\"Eve of Destruction\\"?<br /><br />You might leave here for three days in space,<br /><br />But when you return, it's the same old place.<br /><br />There is a difference between the mystical and the spiritual.	2004-11-16

Reading individual scientific works on brain/mind issues with the goal of gaining insight into how the mind works can be - well, mind numbing. I greatly appreciate John Horgan's  journalistic, no-holds-bared approach to the subject. What does he discover? The field is wide open, massively complex and contradictory. And he lets you know it in a fast paced conversational style.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much. In particular I enjoyed the interviews with James Austin and Susan Blackmore. I respect the imposition of Mr. Horgan's personal views. This is a book by a journalist, not a peer review.  I recommend it to everyone with a general interest in mind studies.	2004-11-15

Is scientific research winding down? Is what we can know scientifically coming to an end? At some point every scientist asks him/herself this question. It's a fair question for a journalist and a great one for access to so many scientists.<br /><br />I enjoyed the breadth of scientific scope here along with the conversational style. Truth be told, I am envious of Mr. Horgan's ability to spend time with all of these people. I appreciate being able to read both their and his thoughts on the premise of this book.<br /><br />Is science at an end? Never as long as there are folks around to ask the question and stimulate debate. I recommend this book wholeheartedly to everyone interested in contemporary science.	2004-11-15

Doing neuroscience is hard. Doing both and writing an objective work on them together is a near impossibility. Dr. James Austin has succeeded. This work is a marvelous combination of western scientific objectivity and Buddhist detachment. I recommend it to anyone who meditates and asks themselves, what's going on in my brain as I do this?<br /><br />I must admit, this book was not an easy read for me. I am not trained in human anatomy or brain structure. I used several medical books and a brain coloring book to keep the parts straight in my mind.

From the preface, \\"This book is about the moral, emotional, and political colorings of the concept of human nature in modern life.\\" Alright, what is human nature, where does it come from and how is it employed? Mr. Pinker tackles these questions with skill and grace in an evocative way. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in human cognition and its effects.<br /><br />While I found myself arguing with some of Mr. Pinker's assumptions and conclusions, never did I think he was way out in left field. Instead he helped me to clarify my own assumptions and conclusions. This is the mark of a well presented argument by my way of thinking. Mr. Pinker enlarges the arena of discourse rather than narrows it.<br /><br />Lastly, this book is more tightly defined than his book, \\"How the Mind Works.\\" Both are thought provoking but if you can only read one, read this one.	2004-11-14

Perhaps that's too complicated since it needs a rider to be in a state of working. Then, how does a windmill work? Yes it needs wind, but let's take the wind for granted here. Also, let's lay aside the knowledge there are different types of windmills all designed by different people. Let's assume we know one when we see one. So how does it work? We are immediately confronted by style and method and purpose. There are many ways to describe the workings of a windmill. Is any one enough? Are all descriptions necessary for truth? And what do we mean by \\"work\\" anyway?<br /><br />If thinking about a relatively simple mechanical device raises so many questions, how many more are raised by thinking about the thinking thing itself - the mind? Why does thinking about how the mind works make predicting the lottery each week seem plausible? Why is \\"mind\\" so hard to pin down?<br /><br />Kudos to Steven Pinker for taking this on in such a pleasurable, readable, thought provoking way. As he says in the preface, this account is a bird's eye view of how the mind works, a survey, It is both for the specialist and the thoughtful layperson.<br /><br />As a survey the book is broad but the access to it is specific, Mr. Pinker says, \\"...the mind is a system of organs of computation designed by natural selection  to solve the problems faced by our evolutionary ancestors...\\" He then elaborates adroitly for the next 565 pages. This book is engaging and thought provoking. I recommend it to you. Since you read this far in a review, I am sure the book itself will be of interest to you.<br /><br />I wrote much marginalia in my copy of this book, often taking a different position and questioning assumptions. My one outstanding argument with Mr. Pinker comes from a statement he makes near the end of the book, \\"Psychologists and neuroscientists don't study their own minds; they study someone else's.\\" In the margin I wrote, \\"Too bad, they should.\\" By this I meant that eastern traditions of contemplation, reflection, and meditation provide tools for studying the mind. These tools would be a welcome addition to western science.reflection, and meditation provide tools for studying the mind. These tools would be a welcome addition to western science.	2004-11-14

How things develop to form something complex not readily apparent from its constituent parts or beginnings. Steven Johnson is thorough, appealing, and clear in his writing. I found this work interesting and engaging. I recommend it to all.<br /><br />My one criticism of this book is a personal one, not one of error on the author's part. I found this work to be too personality driven. It felt to me to be too much about individual characters and less about ideas. In fact, I think if the actual ideas were distilled from this work the amount would be less than the book suggests.

I applaud Dr. Schwartz' work with OCD patients and his use of meditation techniques in his practice. The integration of eastern meditation techniques with western science is in a very amorphous state at this time. However, Dr. Schwartz' book details how they can be used together in this instance with a quantifiable positive result.<br /><br />This book is easy to read, thought provoking and a positive contribution to scientific integration of non-traditional medical techniques. I recommend it to everyone curious about the role of the mind in medical care.<br /><br />I am a practitioner of mindfulness based meditation. I am not a Buddhist. I say this because I have experienced some of the insights that this meditation technique offers and know first hand that it has the potential to be a powerful tool in modern western science. I applaud Dr. Schwartz and other medical researchers (Jon Kabat-Zinn and James Austin come to mind) for their pioneering work. I also say this because it skews my perspective on this book.

The Wizard of Oz said to Dorothy, \\"You had the power to go home all the time. You just had to realize it.\\" That is the message of this book and others like it. Of course the realizing can be a journey and take some time and effort. But most importantly it has to be directly experienced, not just intellectually understood or faithfully believed.<br /><br />I do not doubt the veracity of the people who have had their lives changed by reading this book and following its tenets. However, I must say that the most well intentioned self-help books often fail to achieve for their readers the desired effect. Not only do they fail but the rebound effect of that failure leaves the vulnerable reader/practitioner worse off then when they started.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book ( or the 10-day workshop) to anyone who is feeling down for any reason. Instead, I urge you to call a talk therapist and make an appointment; eat appropriately, get at least seven hours of sleep a night, and make sure you are doing something physical each day, like walking.<br /><br />It's true, there is nothing wrong with you, but having the direct experience of that truth takes balanced thoughtful effort.

I recommend The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins not because it proves its theme, but because it makes the argument well. The large number of reviews, of all persuasions, here supports my statement.<br /><br />Mr. Dawkins makes a strong scientific argument, but all to often stirs up the pot by making personal nonscientific statements. I have been put off by arguments from both extremes: there absolutely is a God, there absolutely is not. For me, evolution by natural selection has always been a wonderfully good descriptor of biologic change over geologic time. I personally have never taken it as a statement on the origination of life. Spirituality and metaphysics are another topic altogether.<br /><br />There are places in The Blind Watchmaker where Mr. Dawkins expresses his personal views above and beyond his scientific insight. So be it. I can see them for just that and read on. His personal views do not impinge on his reasoned argument for evolution by natural selection. This is my favorite Richard Dawkins book.<br /><br />For me in the end, belief in evolution by natural selection does not eliminate God, it only expands my wonder. I think this book will expand yours too.	2004-11-13

This review is far more about the reviewer's limitations than the author's expertise. I read books on cosmology for balance and perspective. Let me explain. My main interest is psychology and metaphysics. Mix that with a belief in a universal ecology (I shall let that go undefined except to say that all things seem to be unified and intelligible across space and time) and I find myself searching for more insight into the physical and historical texture of my present reality.<br /><br />\\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\" presents detailed descriptions of space, time, and the big bang. I am capable of following the logic of and enjoy Mr. Greene's enthusiasm for the subject. But my limitation is a lack of imagination. In this fine book I cannot wrap my mind around something primary: the light beam-two slit experiment. I wish it were a Click & Clack puzzler. I recognize my limitation as a cognitive disconnect on my part. In trying to grasp the meaning behind the experiment, I find myself being the slits arguing between themselves: the photon passed through me, no it passed through me.<br /><br />If I cannot grasp a repeatable experiment imagine my disconnect when it comes to string theory. Despite my limitations, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who asks the BIG questions. I enjoyed having my envelope pushed into the 10th dimension and reduced to repulsive gravity. Perhaps it can all be described as a Click & Clack puzzler. I must keep in mind its all ironic and elicits a good laugh.	2004-11-13

This is a thought provoking work. Which thoughts it stimulates in you will be different from mine, but just as interesting. The fact that this work is so easily readable may be not just a pleasure, but a drawback. I say this in reference to the subtitle. I fear (perhaps unjustly) that  readers may think all critical changes lead to catastrophe.

The road to Canterbury is very long, especially when it takes four billion years. It would be appropriate to say basing this work on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is a novel idea, if the work were a novel, but it is not. At a quarter of a million words, Ancestor's Tale is large enough for two or three standard novels. Despite its overall conversational tone, it is a dull read. As I trudged my way through it I heard the kids yelling, are we there yet?<br /><br />Ancestor's Tale is a work more for knowledgeable lay readers than scientists. While the subject matter is interesting, the delivery is not. I put the blame for this squarely in the hands of Mr. Dawkins' editor. Ancestor's Tale if tightened by one third or one half and rewritten more as a true pilgrimage story than a literary conceit, would work far better and be read by more people.<br /><br />I can only recommend this book to those who already know Mr. Dawkins work and wish to keep up with him.	2004-11-13

As with each of his musical releases, Bob Dylan excites, amuses, frustrates, and stimulates in this streaking comet of personal reflection.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Mr. Dylan's career and music, then most likely you will expect Chronicles Volume 1 to detail every breath of boyhood life on the Iron Range of Hibbing, Minnesota. You will wait for Volume 2 to detail more. But as with every musical release Dylan never addresses your expectations.<br /><br />Chronicles Volume 1 details not a life or a period in a life or a particular aspect of a life, but one moment in this artist's life. Just one moment. It's the moment at the cross roads of destiny; the make-or-break moment of a passion, of a career, of a life.<br /><br />The moment is 1961. A boy leaves his home in the mid-west full of energy, passion, and ambition to make it as a folk singer in New York City. At the cusp of adulthood. risking everything, young Robert Zimmerman forges a new identity, sleeps on friends sofas, plays music in every coffeehouse, nightclub, and bar that will have him, falls in love, and absorbs everything musical.<br /><br />Chronicles Volume 1 starts here and ends here with flash-forwards, first ten years to an intense transitional period, between manic success and private family life, and then again about twenty-six years to an artistic transition in musical style and a detailed look at how one recording was created.<br /><br />Dylan smashes your expectations about what he will tell you. He makes you frustrated and amused, but leaves you stimulated and amazed. This is the autobiography of a poet and troubadour, a man whose feet are firmly on the ground and whose head is, well, is somewhere beyond yours and mine.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone who is the least bit curious about Bob Dylan.
