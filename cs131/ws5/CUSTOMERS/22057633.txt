Although at first I thought it started a little slow but almost halfway through if picked up tremendously. Having to wait until next year for Rhage's story is to long and Zadhist. I highly recommend this book.	2005-10-05

My first complaint was that the book was too long and secondly the bickering went on continuously. I was mentally drain by the time I finished this novel. There was so much more that could have been done with this book.	2005-09-15

Kimerla on the other hand worked my last nerve sometimes with her selfish attitude, but I have to give it to her though when it came time to protect herself she was the bomb. I highly recommend this one it's a keeper. Someone need to turn this into a movie.	2005-09-06

Needless to say I was a bit disappointed. I thought the book didn't pick up until chapter 20 and what kind of FBI Agent was Hennessy? I'll tell you a bad one. Also what is the deal with everybody winking there eye; I noticed the same thing in her other book. All in all I didn't care for this book and wished I had went to the library to pick this one up.	2005-09-06

I still thought it was a good read, it picked up a lot later in the book and became a very good novel. I enjoyed catching up on the rest of the clan Jackson, Griff, Dix and Preacher.

Ms. Banks takes Damali and her Guardians to Brazil and then into the Jungles for the fight of there lives. I thought the love scene between Damali and Carlos was HOT! What a vampire. The only complaint I have is that the book was way too long and could have been at least ten chapters as the Awaking was. As far as the slang, once you keep reading the book you don't even notice it anymore. But keeping true to the characters I couldn't see it any other way. Good Book pick it up.	2005-07-06

You know the kind of story. What a major major disappointment. I only read maybe a good five chapters from this book and I made myself read those few and still did not miss a beat. There was so much that could have been done with this story.	2005-05-13

Although I did enjoy the last three or four chapters of the book the rest was just okay to me. I have to admit there were some very hot scenes between Alex and Christy. I wouldn't mind reading a story about the Sheik I hope in the future Ms. Jackson does his story. Although I didn't care for this book I will still continue to support Ms. Jackson I am a big fan of hers.	2005-05-05

Toward the middle of the book it picked up and started to become a good read as with his other book Sympathy for the devil. I thought the book could have been cut down by some chapters and less some of the details. One of the Chapters I had to go back and re-read to make sure I didn't miss something. Overall I will read another Angela Bivens novel by this author because I like mysteries.	2005-03-10

I'm a big fan of Connie Mason but this book was not one of her best reads it had potential but just didn't make it for me. I got so tired of the author mentioning belle's leg, okay we know it's \\"lame\\" as it was mention over and over again. Belle not trusting Casey was wearing me OUT. Get this one from a friend or the library.	2005-02-16

The book was more of a family reunion than a story about Selig and Erika. Although I enjoyed hearing about the rest of the family his story did not stand alone. I thought a couple of chapters could have been eliminated. The first two books in the Viking series I highly recommend they are excellent reads. Find this one at your local library.	2005-02-15

At times it even got on my nerves the way they kept mentioning how she's not the most beautiful woman he has ever met. The author made and irritating note to mention it several times. Another was how the people around him never ever defy him, whatever. I did enjoy the mystery that was the only thing that got this review 3 stars.	2005-01-12

The book started off with a bang and then took a nose dive. I have never in all my reading seen a heroine as weak as Amanda and I have seen plenty but this was Ridiculous. The Mother was trifling and \\"Jace\\" although good-looking was mean as hell one minute and honey this the next and if I had to hear about her slender body and hands more time I thought I would scream. Overall I did not like this book what- so-ever.	2005-01-07

Personally I thought the book was too long and if I had to hear \\"Lawd quit\\" one more time I thought I would scream. I also hate it when authors stress designer names for EVERYTHING down to the makeup. I thought the story started off good but buy the middle of the book it became tiring. Why in all of these books do the heroine always run out before getting the entire story. When I started reading this book I wanted to get Chloe and Devon's book but I don't think so.	2004-09-29

One would think with name and the cover that \\"Brazen\\" is not a teen read. The story was dragged out to long. I think they should have gotten married and concentrated on there relationship. I don't know but this book was not good at all.	2004-09-08

I thought the book could have been much shorter with some of the details. Lauren got on my nerves sometimes because she was always the victim but in the end she gain a lot of strenth and courage. Roget I could have him strangled the way he treated Lauren but all in all I thought the book a pretty good read. It's good to read African American novels set back in the 1800's in another country. I wish we had more authors as Patricia Vaugh and Beverly Jenkins.	2004-06-14

Let's not even discuss the ending.	2004-01-02
