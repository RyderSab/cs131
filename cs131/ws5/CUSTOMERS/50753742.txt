I didn't find this amazing, but yet from the first page of the preface, Dr. Savage's words, definitions, vocabulary, and explanation of his concepts are even more prescient than I thought then--and thoroughly applicable today.<br /><br />Like Savage, I'm a trained scientist. However, I wouldn't venture into political theory in the way he has so successfully. Yet, I'm fully qualified to speak about the effects of borders, language, and culture on a society and nation as he is--and have studied history as much as he has (even reading Paris in the Revolution and being thoroughly familiar with the revolutions of 1848, and the decline of several empires).  America never aspired to empire, although I wonder if we would be worse off for doing so.  Taft was such a benevolent administrator of the Philippines after the Spanish-American War, so artfully engineered by Theodore Roosevelt, that I wonder if some 3rd world nations wouldn't have benefitted from the export of some Americanism just as India benefitted from the imposition of the British educational system, which we still see today (oh, those H1B Visas!).<br /><br />Dr. Savage saw the societal decline that would be brought on by lying fake news and so-called liberalism (SJW-wealth and demoralization redistribution downward--or is that upward????....I would be horrified to find that I committed such an error as to mistake up for down, east for west, and that my fine education was a waste.....). Fear not, I did not nor will my progeny end up at Evergreen State University.  Though I could have claimed Hispanic origin, I lived and was brought up in a meritocracy, so don't come crying when I tell you that liberalism, snuck in when I was watching the Vietnam War with Walter Cronkite at dinner (barf), by the demoncats of the 1960s to re-establish the plantation, that I've mistaken Savage's message....the peril he well explained in his radio and book career, but as he said, he's done enough.  America will remain or fall on the vision of its founders, plain and simple. And I don't think they could have imagined how the technocrats would subjugate event he intelligentsia within 300 years (mass genocide not being necessary).  Try telling a friend (SJ if you have one) that you're reading the Federalist Papers or Thomas Jefferson.  Hamilton has only been rehabilitated because of the mass disrespect given VP Pence at a performance on Broadway. Otherwise, I doubt many people today would know who he was, or what his principles were.<br /><br />To the Savages and Savagettes, Dittoheads and Levinites, I think you must read this book again--if you really understood it on round 1.<br /><br />You have to give Dr. Michael (Weiner) Savage his due.  He is one of the great thinkers of our time, successful as a scientist and successful as a political philosopher.  The title is provocative, and &#34;liberalism&#34; isn't slated to join the nomenclature of Mental Disorders formally recognized.  However, the &#34;treatment&#34; is not medical--it is political.<br /><br />This book communicates ideas that some readers will be well familiar with from his syndicated 3-hour radio show on KNEW....rather than simply complain about the state of America today, he offers concrete and do-able solutions in plain English--the language of America.<br /><br />I wouldn't look for a foreign translation too soon.  Dr. Savage's main themes, that our nation is based in and has survived due to maintainence of our borders, language, and unique culture--SHOULD BE WELL KNOWN to all citizens and wanna-be citizens.<br /><br />I don't think it is quoted in this book, but one American visiouanry, Theodore Roosevelt, once said that what America needs are NOT hyphenated Americans.  Do you know anyone who came to this country wanting to KEEP the oppressive identity and culture he left behind?  By the way, &#34;he&#34; is a linguistic convention, not anti-feminism.<br /><br />Savage shows great intellectual clarity--exposing the problems of liberal thinking and multiculturalism, and dare one add &#34;diversity&#34; to the destruction of American culture.  We are on the precipice of our survival--and we had best listen.Savage shows great intellectual clarity--exposing the problems of liberal thinking and multiculturalism, and dare one add &#34;diversity&#34; to the destruction of American culture.

Of the two books in the \\"Politically Incorrect Guide to\\" series of which I am aware, this one has garnered 128 reviews, the other 5 as of this date (the other, \\"The Policically Incorrect Guide to American History\\" I highly recommend.<br /><br />I would say that in 2005 (the publishing imprimatur) Mr. Spencer has taken on a controversial subject that cannot be ignored.  Often treatises on Islam are criticised for taking the Koran (or Qur'an, or however you believe is the politically correct spelling--rememeber the cultural revolution in China which led to changes in the writing of all manner of Chinese political names?)...well, what one person can call the \\"religion of peace\\" is supported by another's literal guide to terrorism and emulation of Muhammad's acts based on the principle that \\"when you meet the infidel (non-fundamentalist Muslim) on the road, slit his--or her--throat).  Conversion at the blade of a knife is not conversion.  Or is it?<br /><br />This book should be read by all Americans--I think it can be understood at the 10th grade reading level at least, and should be in the curriculum of any basic political science, philosophy, theology, or world affairs syllabus.  There are similar books (such as \\"Preachers of Hate\\") but this is eminently readable--somewhere between \\"Islam for Dummies\\" and whatever cartoon book is currently being handed out to American troops in Iraq...<br /><br />Even if you disagree with a book that exposes fundamentalist/radical Islam, including Shira law which allows for the oppression of women and wife-beating at the mere suspicion of straying from the \\"true path\\", this is an important text.  I urge Westerners concerned with the oncoming Islamo-fascist invasion (a term coined by Dr. Michael Savage and now in wide circulation) to read this work and take its admonitions seriously.<br /><br />If you want to understand the origins of 9/11, they go back to time of the Crusades, when Europe fought back Islam conquest which had reached France--not simply the unheeded warnings of the \\"Able Danger\\" spions in the Department of Defense who were aware of the specifics of Muhammand Atta's plans well prior to the end of the Clinton administration.

First, if you didn't care much about Amercian History the first or second time around, and now avoid conversations because of your ignorace, this easy reader will go a long way to remedy this situation. Second, it is CORRECT, which textbooks you would have been exposed to probably were not.  Third, you will have documentation of positions that MOST PEOPLE don't know--for example, that the Civil War was NOT about slavery, that the Federal Government destroys crops to keep prices artificially high, that the Marshall Plan did not restore Germany after WW2, but abolition of price controls and a free economy DID.  You'll find out why the Great Society programs of the 1960s kept poverty in place, and in fact expanded it.  You'll discover that during the Clinton administration, \\"special permission was required for the promotion of all white men without disabilities.\\"  Sound familiar?  That President Clinton, during the longest period of \\"peace\\" deployed the American military overseas 44 times in 8 years, while previously, in 45 years, deployment only occurred 8 times.<br /><br />That's just the tip of the iceberg.  This is an essential book in a small library, would be an excellent \\"home schooling\\" text, and goes a long way toward remdiation of common urban, suburban, and rural \\"myths.\\"  Most highly recommended by a well-trained researcher.	2005-10-04

From his first book, \\"Hitler's Jewish Soldiers...\\" I knew I could expect a well-researched and documented book on an obscure but important topic concerning the Third Reich, one of my own major interests.<br /><br />Dr. Rigg has outdone himself.  While his first book was occasionally slow-moving (growing out of a doctoral dissertation), \\"Rescued from the Reich\\" is both well-documented and shows evolution of Dr. Rigg's historical narrative style, making it more of a page-turner or page-burner, which adds a great deal to a book of this type.  Also, now fully-fledged a professional historian, I think I see Dr. Rigg willing to make more speculations, which increase the readability of this work.<br /><br />Who could believe it?  An Abwehr officer, half-Jewish, sent to Warsaw in the middle of the bombing of Poland to rescue the Rebbe of the Lubavitch sect from the German advance and the eventual Final Solution?  It is not only believeable, but of course true--and in that sense, a political thriller.  In \\"Der Untergang\\", a film growing out of the novel of the same name, we see Heinrich Himmler encouraging his Fuehrer even in the last dark days of the Reich, while Berlin is being shelled, to consider \\"making politics\\" (Politik machen) with the Western Allies.<br /><br />I think Admiral Canaris and Major Ernst Bloch, responding to a request from Washington, were doing the same--making politics, with an eye toward the disastrous future for Germany.  Only in such a way could such a mission be justified by the Abwehr--the German CIA, which trumped even the Gestapo (inner Germany secret police, analagous to the FBI).<br /><br />I cannot recommend this historial work more highly--to anyone interested in the evolution of the Third Reich, WW2, the Holocaust, and intelligence matters.  Great effort, Dr. Rigg!	2005-07-25

These are difficult books to integrate, and Singh's effort complements that of Dr. Ralph A. Alpher and Dr. Robert Herman.  Dr. Alpher remains amongst the \\"last Big Bang\\" men and women standing (allusion to an excellent Discover magazine article).<br /><br />For those interested in cosmology, this belongs on one's bookshelf as a reference, and I recommend it as such.  As one very familiar with the history, I feel that Singh has made an excellent contribution to ground that has required re-examination at a time when the easier writing project on new turf is possibly more rewarding.  For historians of science, this is a distinction.  It is NOT a physics textbook.<br /><br />Humans seem hard-wired to like very much, or intensely dislike, one or another political version of an historical event.  So it is here, and the reader will have to make the ultimate judgment.	2005-02-19

Colonels, \\"Unknown negro\\" of Longstreet's Corps to \\"Unknown Georgia Captain.\\"<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by one of the stalwarts of the bookstore at the Gettysburg National Historical Park.  You will not be disappointed.  Views from Confederate Marylanders to Virginians to Texans are presented, in easily read snippets....and while Gen. Armistead and Kemper may be missing, this is not an attempt to be complete, but rather to be interesting.  And, thankfully, this 143 page book is quite varied, with those fighting for the C.S.A. separated by the three days of action at Gettysburg.  From the actual accounts written at the time, to Coco's interpretations, background and so forth, this book will stand well on the shelf on anyone interested in the War of Northern Aggression, Yankee or Southern Confederate American.  Well done.	2005-01-31

When I heard her comment to Sean Hannity on the radio that she takes the bus (and seemed proud of it), I decided to read this book.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  As a trained scholar who appreciates good writing, a good argument, and a well thought out opinion, I cannot recommend this book more highly.  It is timely (how some of the material was included so soon after events is a publishing marvel), reads like a page-turning novel.<br /><br />One part of the book is a true highlight that will stand the test of time, and goes beyond contemporary politics.  This is her chapter on the Confederate flag, and the source of our military might and culture.  It is almost definitive, if anything can be on the subject.  I've seen a t-shirt that is recently popular....it has a Confederate battle flag (the square one, which by the way, was never the \\"political\\" flag of the Confederate States of America.  Beneath it says...\\"If this flag offends you, you need to read some American history.\\"<br /><br />I would add, if that flag offends you, you need to read some Ann Coulter!  Way to go, Ann!

I think there is a great deal that is not known about Eisenhower's halt at the Elbe, and gift of what became East Germany to the Russians.  Surely he had some inkling of what was to come. The consequences are widely known and tragic.<br /><br />That is not all that defies explanation. Herr Udo Pfleghar search long in the National Archives for an answer to this question, and I highly recommend his book (in German) of 1998. Moreover, it took high reprimand from Truman to move Eisenhower to do anything about the tragic conditions of displaced persons and concentration camp survivors after the war (see Hilliard's \\"Surviving the Americans\\").<br /><br />I admire Ambrose for trying to figure out an answer to this question, however insufficient, and I don't think interviews with higher-ups in other regimes would have helped answer the questions....the answers are still classified, probably never to see the light of day despite massive recent declassifications, due to the \\"Catch-22s\\" of the Freedom of Information Act and questions of national security.  A hundred years hence, there will be few who really know. Of course, that's just one man's opinion.	2004-09-21

This is what a woman of &#34;breeding&#34; would look for in the late 1800s as a spouse, and she became his 2nd wife, possibly the better of 2.  His first wife may have benefitted more from his unspent youthful energy--whereas Edith was able to provide the family life that this man of notable achievement by age 42, and yet even MORE achievement in the next 18 years that he needed.  He never had to 2nd guess a career decision, because he knew he had her backiing, as well as her skillful home management.  This was especially important once be started serviing in unelected, and later elected positions, in Washington and Albany.<br /><br />Theodore Roosevelt was comfortable--even sought--the company of the famous and infamous and from a rather unimpressive stature rose to be one of our greatest, most patriotic and driven Presidents.  He saw the potential benefit of spending time with outstanding &#34;stout-hearted&#34; men of muscle, who cleared the wilderness for cities and civilisation.  He found ways of connecting to me of different social classes, while championing women's suffrage (as a Republican), the one time when he had to make a decision that he knew would (might) offend someone, he made the decision and apparently suffered no negative consquences.  This was when he was offerred membership in the top social club at Harvard, when he thought he had accepted (further closing off opitions) memberhsip int the #2 social club.  He accepted membership in the Porcellian cluib.  We can assume that later battles were never personal, but based on priniciple.  This is what made Theodore Roosevelt different from other presidents, thus far.  What he eventually did after gaining office he believed was in the best interests of every citizen, while he accepted to the social class structure that permeated America in the late 19th century.  He didn't oppose the social class structure--he embraced it. He saw it as his duty as a member of the upper classes to do his best to improve the lot of immigrants, the poor, and the lower classes, to use his genetic blessing (birth into the Roosevelt family) and hardships (poor eyeseight and weak constitution) for good.  Today he might be passed off as Nationalistic or Jingoistic (or Patriotic) but he beleieved that there was no such thing as a &#34;hypenated&#34; American; he spent most of his life trying to demonstrate what a true &#34;American&#34; is--and this was part of his great general (populist) acceptance and popularity.

It should be re-released, every year or so, with great fanfare. I can think of few Oscar-winning movies save \\"The Pianist\\" that were not massively re-released, but I find no evidence this was.<br /><br />However, in print, the story is even more moving, in the words of the protagonists.  It is more the amazing not only that Szpilman survived, yet is quite unknown to Americans, but also that Wilm Hosenfeld is virtually unknown, even amongst Jews and the Liberal political crowd. This is abominable.<br /><br />I have read another book of the collected letters of Hosenfeld, in German, titled \\"Ich suche jeden zu retten: Das Leben eines deutschen Offiziers in Briefen and Tageb&uuml;chern\\"--literally, I seek someone to rescue:  The life of a German officer in letters and daybooks.  Daily journals are not a tradition here in America, but the are and were in Germany, and are a rich source of information about a person's motives and thinking behind public actions.<br /><br />In light of the current controversy of the participation of German Police and the Army (Wehrmacht), once thought apolitical, in the so-called \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\" (Endl&ouml;sung der Judenfrage), Hosenfelds words are all the more piercing. One must also read Hilliard's \\"Surviving the Americans\\" to help round out what is still obscure but crucial history of the 20th Century.<br /><br />Whether you need large print or not, please do read this amazing true story.	2004-09-19

He learned thereby to have some disdain for history. Tony Horwitz, finding himself deep in the middle of Confederate Virginia, found himself in the embrace of the ongoing Civil War, the one that continues today and leads thousands of men to camp on hard, frozen ground to re-enact the important battles (and in many cases, the unimportant battles). There can be little doubt that the War of Northern Aggression continues, and that those who honor their heritage on both sides do so in earnest and with passion.<br /><br />This book is a great window into an important part of the American landscape. I think it would appeal especially to the perplexed--those who know little of this history, or the current debates, for example, about the Confederate Battle Flag (it was square, not the rectangular Naval Jack so commonly seen and co-opted by racist groups).<br /><br />There is great humor here, but one should not forget that many take this history and heritage very seriously. I recommend the book, particularly for the description of \\"the rush\\" (I will leave it to the interested reader to find out what this is).

Could that be far from the truth?<br /><br />Dr. Hilliard, now Professor of Communications at Emerson College in Boston, was there. What we don't know, and now must face, is that very little was done for many months after the war for D.P.s (Displaced Persons), Jews, survivors of the Concentration Camps (Jews, political prisoners, intellectuals).  In fact, there was no \\"official\\" hospital to take care of those who required such medical assistance, and it took some ingenuity and subterfuge to create one.  And, in September, after an article appeared in the New York Times (then a true paper of record), President Truman had to order Dwight Eisenhower to provide more assistance in the U.S. Military Zone to the survivors of the Holocaust and the Third Reich, officially....Eisenhower comfortably situated in Paris.<br /><br />After V-E Day, during what GIs called \\"National Lorelei Month\\", many American soldiers were killed by unrepentant Nazis and Germans if they dared venture (armed or unarmed) from the safety of U.S. installations.  Meanwhile, Germans played the black market with crafty soldiers interested in making money, bartering for sex with women (many of whom undoubtedly had lost their husbands and boyfriends to the Reich), and occasionally, supplying an unauthorized hospital which is the focus of this book.<br /><br />Some 7,000 U.S. personnel lost their lives after V-E Day to the \\"Werewolves\\" recruited by Himmler and his disciples in the S.S.

Col. Patterson's motives for writinig this book were rather altruistic.  Otherwise, it makes little sense.  With nearly day to day close contact with a President, he was in a great position to observe how that person handled the regular duties of office, including in this case, the \\"nuclear football\\"--the case with the codes for launching nuclear weapons.<br /><br />This account is especially significant since Col. Patterson's observations come after the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the \\"New World Order\\" as so frequently referred to by President George Herbert Walker Bush.<br /><br />Simply put, the seeming arrogance, lack of time response to messages from security personnel, and seeming disdain for this all-important duty puts President Clinton, at least in this dedicated non-political soldier's view, in a questionable position to be \\"Commander-in-Chief.\\"<br /><br />We all hope that the politically elected President will take this job seriously.  I cannot see where this retired Air Force officer had anything to gain by writing the book.  It could have as easily flopped as become a New York Times bestseller.  I am not a military man, but I do have a good idea of what it takes to become a Lt. Col. in the Air Force, and therefore I have no reason to doubt Col. Patterson's veracity.<br /><br />More importantly, there has been no credible refutation of what he saw, including the other military personnel who had the same duty during different shifts.  What is more, his observations of the First Lady, now a politician, and Senator with Presidential ambitions, makes this a must read for any informed citizen.<br /><br />It is neither too long nor difficult to read--an afternoon's read at even a slow pace.  Prepare to begin shaking your head.<br /><br />Many consider Mr. Clinton to be one of our greatest presidents, yet this casts considerable doubt upon such a belief in the presence of unrefuted observation.	2004-09-16

There will be some limitations.  Those are apparent here in the method--what was learned by two journalists assigned to Chechnya for a 3 year period, approximately, in the mid-1990s.  The book was published in 1998.<br /><br />Despite those method weaknesses, and others pointed out by other reviewers, I recommend this book for a few reasons.  It is a harkening back to the time of Yeltsin, whom it seemed the American administrations were very fearful of living without--now we have some history with Mr. Putin.  And, we know the epilogue is continued problems with the Chechens, and Islam.  In this regard the book is a very readable prologue to what we faced after 9/11, and provides some historical background.  It doubt that 1 of 100 Americans could find Chechnya on a map, yet this is part of the world region that will determine the fate of the world.<br /><br />Highly recommended for intelligence and counterintelligence enthusiasts, because you have to learn a new way of thinking to understand this conflict.

Bekker incorporates many archival photos and knowledge of tactics used in various phases of the naval war conducted above and below the seas, including the problems of battleship technology, development of the U-Boat Waffe.  Chapters on artic warfare, the Mediterranean operations, U-Boats in distant oceans, and torpedo boats in the Dover Straits are especially interesting.<br /><br />The book loses little in translation from German, and Bekker is an acknowledged expert.  Published before the pivotal film Das Boot, it would be a great companion to serious study of that film and subsequent U-Boat films, as well as the works of Guenther-Buchheim.<br /><br />There is little doubt that Naval personnel of both sides in this war were men of the greatest courage and devotion to their comrades.  Recommended.	2004-09-11

Thus, the lessons of 1861-1865 are as much modern lessons as windows to the thoughts and predicaments of children and adolescents in that unfortunate conflagration.  Thankfull, there is little psychobabble to explain why a boy would seek to participate, or a young girl seek to honor her elders who participated and suffered.<br /><br />One of the youngest drummer-boys, John Clem, ultimately became a General and lived to 1937.  I would like to have seen more about his life, and perhaps a biography is in order.<br /><br />The book also speaks to the raised hopes, ultimately dashed, of freed children in slavery--for example, Mattie Jackson, of Missouri, wrote an autobiography in 1866 prefaced with the statement \\"I ask you to buy my little book to aid me in obtaining my education that I may be enabled to do some good on behalf of the elevation of my emacipated brothers and sisters.\\" Her \\"book\\" was written down by a friend who was literate, and who edited it.<br /><br />As we know, the last know Confederate widow, Ms. Alberta Martin, recently passed on.  The heritage of this crucial defining time in American history is still important, as witnessed by Gen. Colin Powell's 1996 dedication of a monument to the 185,000 black soldiers who fought for the Federal army.  What we need is a monument to all who fell, suffered disease and deprivation, loved ones who spent the rest of their lives permanently changed by the conflict--a truly integrated monument and dedication to the Irish, Blacks, Jews, Germans, immigrants from near and far, who fought \\"Pro Aris et Pro Focis\\"--for hearth and home (Cicero), a theme found on Federal and Confederate battle flags.<br /><br />\\"With malice toward none, and charity for all\\" to paraphrase Mr. Lincoln, is a promise yet to be fulfilled.  All who seek to preserve their heritage and acknowledge the blessings of living in the America we cherish and which so many seek to reach, is the legacy of the children who witnessed and participated in the American Civil War.  We owe them all, drummer boys and girls on the home front struggling to survive, no less.  However, we cannot call them all \\"reluctant,\\" can we?-a truly integrated monument and dedication to the Irish, Blacks, Jews, Germans, immigrants from near and far, who fought \\"Pro Aris et Pro Focis\\"--for hearth and home (Cicero), a theme found on Federal and Confederate battle flags. <br /> <br />\\"With malice toward none, and charity for all\\" to paraphrase Mr. Lincoln, is a promise yet to be fulfilled.

It is readable to Jew and non-Jew alike (note the review by the Kuwaiti Muslim), and should stand (well-worn) on the bookshelf of anyone interested in the the Five Great Religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Taoism).<br /><br />As for revisions, what is there to revise?  I've seen printings of this book going back to the 1970s, and they are definitive.  Although written from an Orthodox perspective, Donin's writings are as useful to any of the many new Jewish movements beyond the well-known Conservative and Reform groups (please note--it is Reform Judaism, not \\"Reformed\\"--empahsising the intentions of the founders to reformation within Jewish practice, akin to the Protestant reformaton).<br /><br />For the Holocaust scholar or amateur historian--be thankful that this book was not available to Eichmann--who did study Judaism. This knowledge was used against Jews.  Somehow, his teacher (a rabbi) was not able to get across the beauty of the traditions, but then again, his student had already made up his mind and was not malleable.  Some non-Jews reading this book will look for more...Donin's companion book on Jewish prayer would be a good place to start.<br /><br />Highly recommended to Jew, non-Jew, scholar or educated lay readers.	2004-09-09

One would think that the period between Appomatox and the official end of Reconstruction was one of relative non-events...yet on personal levels, from which William Holberton draws, it was a period of passion and uncertainty that we would hardly bear quietly today.<br /><br />During this time, however, was laid the blueprints for many current political issues--political correctness, repatriations to victims of slavery, the development of the Southern Heritage movement in various forms, and regionalization of the South which would last another 140-plus years.<br /><br />As an example, hear the yearnings of a member of the 56th U.S. Colored Infantry Regiment, bound to return to the border state of Missouri...\\"There has severl redgements who enlisted one year after we did mustered out and gone home.  We stood on the bank and she teers to think that we who had batled for our country over two years should still be retaineed and deprived of the privilege of seeing those who are so sear to us\\" (p. 139).  This, from a man who came from those whom sociologists only recently learned had \\"family units\\" and loyaltie that would make a modern divorce lawyer wince.<br /><br />And consider the many who died of disease AFTER the war, or the Ohioans in occupation who were camped south of New Orleans, only to fight alligators, polluted waters, only to move on to the occupation of Texas, an even more formidable assignment, many dying daily of dysentery and like illnesses.<br /><br />My only criticism of this book would be the relative lack of documentation of Confederate demobilization--not surprising, given the manner in which Confederate veterans were treated.  Unfortunately, Lincoln's \\"with malice toward none...with charity for all\\" dictum was not held in wide esteem or knowledge.  The country today would be better for recognition that Confederates (often black or African-American, Jewish, or members of some other \\"minority\\" were fighting as Cicero said, \\"Pro Aris et Pro Focis\\" (for home and hearth) against an invasion, as much as for political beliefs.<br /><br />A volume beloning in any Civil War historian or student's library.toward none...with charity for all\\" dictum was not held in wide esteem or knowledge.

James Bender, San Jose, CA).<br /><br />It is well written, at a junior-high to high school level, and although the first of the \\"Holocaust Biographies\\" series for juvenile readers I have seen, if it is representative of their quality, it is a harbinger of an excellent group of books.  This book also provides good explanations of Fascist/Nazi motivations, their actions, and the Holocaust.  It also discusses the complex motivations of such a man as Mueller himself, who rose from obscurity to one of the highest and most important positions in the Reich.<br /><br />Regarding Mueller, it is mostly definitive, and will introduce the young reader to the perplexing vicissitudes of foe-becomes-friend as loyalties shift in our modern world.	2004-08-25

However, I fear few will read it.....but it will resound amongst those who a troubled about the America we've seen develop since the \\"beat\\" generation.<br /><br />HOW could Alger Hiss, a reknowned Communist, have participated in decision-making at Yalta that would enslave hundreds of millions under Communism?  Did you know that Josef Stalin once studied for the Orthodox priesthood?  Or that Hollywood-beloved Fidel Castro is not a product of the working class, but the University of Havana?  Or that Karl Marx' Das Kapital is a conglomeration of once-rejected theories of dialectics and conflict, hardly original, and read by few who have committed mass atrocities in his name?  Why were the Germans so afraid of Communism, even the Fascists?  Could it be, that in such close proximity, they knew the foe better than we ever would?<br /><br />Did you know that Gorbachev's new \\"perestroika\\" and \\"glasnost\\" were terms used in the early 20th century to soften the image of communism THEN, by Lenin and others, to encourage foreign investment and charity.<br /><br />The core of this book, written in the 1970s, rings true today.  How could avowed Communists infiltrate our highest levels of governments?  Why are they (in America especially) rarely OF the people, but from the upper classes?<br /><br />This is an astounding book, which should cause you to reevaluate terms used constantly, such as Capitalism, Communism, Democracy.  Americans in the \\"fly-over\\" states have more to fear than from a Tim McVeigh or a Terry Nichols.  The Enemy is Within.

I admit I'm a fan of this type of book...state university press, obscure topic...but when it comes to WWII POWs in the U.S., it is even more fascinating, because not only are the truths stranger than fiction...your parents and grandparents probably remember some of this.<br /><br />German POWs were held in virtually every state, mixed with civilians, were treated generally better than any kind of prisoner or \\"minority\\", and were among us.  Some took their memories back to Germany, and some became U.S. citizens.  Perhaps nowhere is the story more interesting of compelling than in Florida, where there remain many \\"denazified\\" and \\"nondenazified\\" Germans.<br /><br />The conditions they lived in were horrendous. Yet, Florida remains a popular destination of Germans on vacation or \\"Urlaub\\". How many are visiting places their parents and grandparents told them about?<br /><br />The documentation and book do focus on one particular camp, Camp Blanding, where prototypical problems amongst Nazis from different countries, regions, and classes of origin found themselves frequently mixed (reminiscent of Katzenbach's \\"Hart's War\\") where black fliers from Tuskegee were imprisoned in a Luftwaffe POW camp.<br /><br />If you want a primer on the problems presented by housing foreign POWs in a host country, with concomitant social, political, economic, and ecological ramifications, this is a great book to start with!	2004-08-23

It is so easy to forget that the Ottoman Empire was largely Muslim, and that they were the Allies of Germany in two world wars.<br /><br />And now, some say, we're in the third world war.  While there are places to quibble (e.g. that non-multiculturalists will be the ultimate losers worldwide)...this is still an important work for anyone who would understand current anti-semitism.<br /><br />As noted, in an Egyptian television series the Protocols are referred to as fact.<br /><br />The \\"fact\\" is is that the Protocols are fiction, but this book ought to stand along your copy of \\"Mein Kampf\\".  I read while in Germany that a Jewish organisation was about to make FREE copies of Mein Kampf available throughout Germany.  Obviously, current readers would see that is was absurd, and reject neo-Nazism.<br /><br />I'm not so sanguine--about readers of \\"Mein Kampf\\" or about readers of sections of the \\"Protocols\\" without adequate context.<br /><br />Whether this provides \\"adequate\\" context is a judgment for the reader.  I think the conclusions are misleading.  However, the context is current, and therefore extremely significant.	2004-08-16

APL later declared that the VT or Proximity Fuze was its first project showing effectiveness from conception to practical application--in other words, from theory to application.<br /><br />Few will know (although you can find some information on the WWW) that the VT Fuze is credited as one of the three top secrets that won the war--the others being D-Day, and the A-Bomb.<br /><br />So, the participants worked on a heady project.  Baldwin declares, and who could argue with the success, that only a democracy such as ours could have unleashed the imagination, creativity, technical prowess and confidence, to actually produce a functioning proximity fuze...the idea being neither original nor particularly \\"new.\\"<br /><br />What is also astounding is that it is clear that two years prior to the War, our government was really actively participating in hiring the greatest minds of the day and harnessing their potential in creating NEW and EFFECTIVE WEAPONS....long before anyone dreamt of Pearl Harbor.  Unfortunatley, the fuze was not yet available on 12/7/41---but it was CLOSE!!!  And, it was most effective against the type of Japanese aircraft deployed that day, saving thousands of lives and time in the Pacific Theater.<br /><br />As Dr. Tuve, head of Section T said, the greatest interest then was TIME, not MONEY.  And, he made sure that Section T delivered.<br /><br />I found on error in the book--a quibble, I suppose--regarding the recognition by the Navy...the Bureau of Ordnace Award (with Symbol) did go to my father--I have it.  Along with his long-time colleague Robert Herman.<br /><br />However, I am somewhat surprised that Hollywood has not made a movie about this period and the development of the proximity fuze...why not?  It is as thrilling as Hunt for Red October, but it isn't fiction.  The information was declassified in 1976, and Baldwin's book followed shortly in 1980.  It is as exciting a read nearly 25 years later as it must have been then, and the ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS are even more thrilling.  What excites more (and Baldwin recognizes this, although it must have been very heady)--very few people knew what they were working on....the tasks, Top Secret, were parceled out in such a way so that millions of these fuzes were produced, but very few knew what they were, how they worked, or why they worked.  EVERY country was working on one.  The Japanese had one, but our taking of Iwo Jima appears to have stopped the program cold.<br /><br />General Patton, I'll paraphrase here, credited this fuze in its horrendous anti-personnel capacity as having won the Battle of the Bulge...and that the \\"funny\\" fuze would revolutionize warfare...until our potential enemies had one.

And that tells you a good deal about charismatic movements, of which Hasselbach was once a rising star.  As he points out, it wasn't about National Socialist ideology, in fact, very few of his cohorts knew much about Jews!  No, it was groupthink, group membership, and drinking koolaid like Jim Jones' followers in Jonestown.  Probably as strikingly handsome in his generation as Heydrich was in his, Herr Hasselbach had a particular world at his feet, and somehow he made the moves to change directions, rather abruptly.<br /><br />Having seen him also interviewed by David Gergen, I have little doubt he is genuine.  However, an autobiography such as this leaves one with many unanswered, perhaps unanswerable questions....since he was in the Neo-N movement when Germany was reunited, I would have liked to have seen more on this turbulent time.  What the autobiography lacks, like most of this type (including certain ex-Presidents) is an overall perspective.<br /><br />However, if you want some insight into foot-soldierdom into cult-like movements, this is a very readable, and recommended, introduction into a shady world.

Art Bell fans, take note.<br />This is not a definitive piece.  However, it contains well-documented events (e.g., acts of espionage based on Nostradamus by U.S. Intelligence during the Second World War).  Madelbaum attempts to place Remote Viewing (final U.S. intelligence report appearing on the World Wide Web in 1998) in a context going back through the history of warfare.  And today, a new generation is becoming familiar with the concept of PSYOPS or Psychological Operations, which has been a facet of the War on Global Terrorism and is not likely to vanish from the scene anytime soon.<br />Some readers will recall Bill Murray's portrayal of Dr. Venkmann who used negative reinforcment (shock) to attempt to &quot;train&quot; fictitious experimental subjects to become more &quot;psychic&quot;.  In the mid-80s, I watched that film as my own work became perhaps one of the last officially (IRB) sanctioned &quot;threat of negative reinforcement&quot; experiments in the annals of experimental psychology....<br />I found the book interesting, with good references, not a bad read at all.  No secrets of Freemasonry are revealed, nor are some of the &quot;special tactics&quot; of the Schutzstaffel (SS), Gestapo (Geheimstaatspolizei), Israeli intelligence, the Mossad, or the global terrorist movement.<br />It is a book within a context, and &quot;Remote Viewing&quot; still has its fans.

For anyone who doesn't understand the fascination of so many with the American Civil War, this book will in short order put your mind at ease that it is worth the years of study that so many put to it, from re-enactors, to college professors. John C. Waugh, in a most easily read fashion, will in less than 100 pages set you on what may become a lifelong passion. He shows how this 1400 Day War brought forth all that is important about the human drive to define its civilization, how so many could risk their lives for idealistic causes (including protecting their own homes and hearth, to paraphrase Cicero)....<br />The reader will easily see how this short 4-year period turned the nation into the great object of desire for peoples world-wide, because it defined a nation of people in which anyone could aspire to accomplish as much, to define life as broadly and grandly as imaginable.<br />True, this conflict did not resolve all conflicts, but it brought the underlying conflicts left unresolved in our founding documents out from behind the curtain for all the masses to see, and the blood shed, the pain endured for lifetimes by many more, really set the course we saw America follow for another century to come and more.<br />Highly recommended!	2004-05-22

This volume tells the history of battles and participants in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the War of Northern Aggression, with an emphasis on the participation of the &quot;civilized&quot; Indian tribes, mostly located in Oklahoma (Indian Territory), their commanders, and the passing through western commands of many &quot;failures&quot; in eastern theatres of the war.<br />This book includes brief biographies (about 1.5 to two pages) of many interesting officers (Stand Watie, Sam Bell Maxey, Albert Pike, Douglas H.

Jackson), some of whom lived until late in the 19th century and saw America go from the ascendancy of the cotton gin to the Industrial Age!<br />With great accompanying photos, clear maps, and great storytelling, this book will leave you wanting to learn more about this rather neglected region of the war, but one no less important in many regards for the defining of the nation's future than the more well-known battlefields of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.  Highly recommended!!!!	2004-05-21

Murrah Federal Building in April, 1995.<br />So much of the official version doesn't &quot;add up&quot; and while one may quibble with the accuracy of Ms. Davis' speculations, what does shine through is the absolute and ethical dedication of an investigative journalist on the track of a tremendously important story, which was &quot;wrapped up&quot; in a rather amazingly quick fashion.  Timothy McVeigh would not speak of any other terrorists until his death.  His conspirator received life in prison.  In the world of this kind of terrorism, we are becoming accustomed to the &quot;need to know&quot; methods of international terrorists.  There is little doubt the McVeigh knew such individuals intimately, and that this sort of terrorist will gladly die without revealing further information.  We are learning more about this at the time of this writing.<br />Perusing other &quot;customer reviews&quot; I'm not surprised by the black and white thinking of many of them.  Some easily will denounce anything having to do with the former FBI director.  We have to face one thing, you don't become FBI director without many contacts, and abilities to manage a huge organization, whether appointed by a Democrat or a Republican.  This former director has much positive to say about Ms. Davis, but he's rather neutral on her conclusions--as he'd have to be. Much of the information Ms. Davis accumulated was admittedly attained illegally (through taping interviews surreptitiously) and I have little doubt that this occurs on a rather routine basis.  Those implicated are not indentified except by pseudonym, but this hardly detracts from the story.<br />That there are internal &quot;enemies&quot; who will conspire with disgruntled invididuals, even those who have &quot;served&quot; in our military, will come as a surprise to no one.  That the FBI or other organizations might not pursue an identified individual, hoping that surveillance will lead to identification of other, more dangerous and higher-level conspirators, also comes as no surprise.<br />This book is a page turner, and will leave the reader wanting to know more.  It casts complete doubt upon the &quot;lone actor&quot; theory but is much more substantive than typical &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; tomes.  I highly recommend it.n our military, will come as a surprise to no one.

My title is a takeoff on a 60s-70s chant--&quot;We will study war no more.&quot;  Michael Shaara's book, which won a Pulitzer in 1974, shows why we SHOULD study war.  He has taken his vast knowledge of the Civil War in general, and Gettysbury in particular, and shaped an historical novel, not exceedingly long, than delves into the lives, motivations, thoughts, feelings, and goals, of many types of people who participated in this great struggle for definition of what it is to be American, to be a citizen of the United States (which, after the war, noted Shelby Foote, a singular noun).<br />In my opinion, and knowing personally about Europeans' interest in our Civil War, this book belongs in the Canon of the Literature of Western Civilization...how can I say this?  It isn't just because I'm interested in the same topic.<br />On a recent airline flight, I had the opportunity to spend about an hour explaining &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; to a young European woman who was assigned that book to read in a high school in Texas....she was in her senior year, with a father in the oil business.<br />Four months later, I received an e-mail, thanking me for that time, and she commented that her teacher was amazed that she had understood the book, and the issues (the enduring prejudice against blacks in the South long after &quot;Reconstruction.&quot;<br />Why is it relevant?  We think we &quot;reconstructed&quot; Europe after World War II--and she realized we hadn't.  The same problems we have 140 years after the spring campaigns of 1864, we also see in Europe only 60 years after the dawning of D-Day.  We have International Courts, the EU, common currencies, almost instantaneous communication worldwide, and what progress has been made?<br />A reading of the Killer Angels will stay with you, cause you to think, and demand that YOUR children study war.  And so help us, the more who understand it, the better.	2004-05-11

This book will be useful not only to the afflicted, but also to those family and friends who must also cope with the &quot;elephant&quot; in the room--which begins to take up a larger and larger portion of the free space around the patient as time goes by, and as the physician(s) become more and more distant, letting you know that the are gradually withdrawing emotionally after the condition becomes one of those within medicine that, frankly, fill most of the charts on the walls of medical records offices.<br />It is much to easy to succumb to the incipient blaming that comes as you repeatedly seek assistance and find little relief, or, worse, manipulation and financial and emotinoal rip-off throughout the health care system.  You know it isn't the people...but it gets harder and harder.<br />This book was first published in 1994, but is no less relevant today than then...and highly recommended.  The subtitle:  Overcoming the challenges of long-term illness....belies the secret greatest obstacle facing many patients in our &quot;modern&quot; society...how to achieve a sense of meaningful life in a society in which we are barraged with the illusion of youth, immortality, health-promotion with little scientific basis, and stereotypes of physical beauty.<br />I would like to see comparisons to those who are &quot;treated&quot; in health-care systems that approach chronicity differently...	2004-05-10

The Metaphysical Club--founded about the time of the American Civil War, brought together some of the best minds of the 19th century.  Some were foreign-born scholars, some became quite well-known intellectuals and academics in their own right.  ALL had a tremendous impact on thinking &quot;distinctly American&quot; that formed the foundation of doctrines such as Manifest Destiny, and fear of the &quot;Mexicanization&quot; of America that continues today.<br />This book is neither easy nor light reading, and will take some time for even the most ardent student of history generally to wade through.  It has to be considered a basic text for anyone interested in intellectual history.  It is without doubt an important work--especially for anyone who today wishes to understand what the rest of the world has thought of or thinks is &quot;American Culture&quot;.  Obviously, this is more complex than simplification of American expansionism as imperialism disguised as altruism.  Nor is it the Culture of the Cowboy, the rugged individualist.<br />However, at the same time that great Armies were further defining the &quot;United States&quot; on great battlefields, on American soil, so too were great Thinkers defining Americanism in precursors of &quot;think tanks&quot; where today the media would seek out people who &quot;really&quot; had something to say about our society.  These were the precursors of the George Wills, the Pat Buchanans, the Sam Donaldsons of our era.<br />While the names will be unfamiliar to some, and the personalities and characters even odd [sic] (even the great William James, M.D., who never practiced medicine, took a significant role)...you will become engaged with the intelligentsia of the United States that predated the Wilsonians of the early 20th century, or the Communists, Socialists, and fellow travelers of the middle 20th century....the Neo-Cons of our time.<br />You'll wonder what has been lost, and how the era of Political Correctness could ever have devolved from this period of intense intellectual activity occurring at a time when even the causes of disease and infection were unknown, and theories of genetics were in their infancy.  Yet &quot;The Metaphysical Club&quot; was a magnet for great thinking.<br />A great read for the reader who likes a real challenge!ever have devolved from this period of intense intellectual activity occurring at a time when even the causes of disease and infection were unknown, and theories of genetics were in their infancy.

We all know that Tom Clancy is a great historical novelist.  This book (and how much he actually wrote is debatable) is like a little &quot;hornbook&quot;--giving you the kind of atmosphere and technical details you could use to start thinking about writing a story--a story about humans with their frailties and courage, with the sea and submarines as a backdrop.<br />Sure. there are inaccuracies, but that isn't the point.  What is mostly correct is there, and in enough detail to give one a fundamental understanding of submarine warfare, and the nature of &quot;going down to sea in ships.&quot; I used the book to help my father, an ex-naval ordnance designer, in recovery from a stroke. It served well.<br />After all, it IS important to know the difference between a Mark 14 and a Mark 10 torpedo, is it not?<br />A fun read, not to be read at one sitting, and will enhance your enjoyment of films such as &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; and &quot;U-571&quot;.  And the Janes series, while technically flawless, won't do that. You'll understand why Clancy has cornered this genre.	2004-05-06

Shelby was the commander of the Missouri Cavalry Division in what was known as the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. His men distinguished themselves, often outnumbered, in battle after battle with the invading Yankees.<br />What is not well-known is that General Shelby did not surrender his forces to swear allegiance to the United States.  Rather, he asked, &quot;who will go with me to Mexico?&quot; and led his men south of the Rio Grande, to uncertain futures in a post-Confederate world. These non-political soldiers were weary of the years of deprivation in the Lost Cause.  This book chronicles some of their adventures, first told to the author as part of oral familial history of the Iron Brigade.  The author met several people in Mexico City in the 1940s who claimed to have witnessed the Last Review.<br />Those who fought under &quot;Old Jo&quot; intended to maintain their sacred honor and &quot;hatred of oppression&quot; brought about by the invasion of the Southern states by what they felt was a mercenary army--and strangulation through blockade by an distained navy that deprived their countrymen, women, and children of basic necessities of life.<br />This is very interesting reading to any student of the American Civil War.  General Shelby and his men finally found themselves caught in a political situation--the desire of Mexico to maintain peace with the United States after a victory over the French--commemorated yearly in the festivals of Cinco de Mayo (recalling May 5, 1862) across the southwestern U.S.<br />Their services refused, Shelby's last review was held in Mexico City, the Rebel Yell last heard amongst the ghosts of the Conquistadores, the Cavalry Guidon lowered, the battle flag having been buried somewhere on the border.<br />These last Confederates dispersed, many going to colonies of expatriates in foreign lands, from Brazil to China.

This book provides documentation of how that total war of destruction was launched and managed.  In that respect, it belongs on any bookshelf for those interested in the prosecution of this war from the German side.  Photographs are carefully selected, showing the Kriegsmarine cadre at the height of its morale.  Additionally, from the \\"Tagebuch\\" or day-book of the \\"First U-Boat Flotilla\\" we see the important day to day operations, and the transition from wolfpacks who dominated the Atlantik from Brest, to the tattered remains compromised by superior counter-intelligence and tactical response.<br />It is no surprise that this work is one in the line published by the distintuished Naval Institute Press.  This book shows the drama of the U-Boat war in reality, just as the film \\"Das Boot\\" did on screen.  Rich in detail, this work provides a great technical treatise that complements that cinematic high drama, also drawn from actual experience of U-96.<br />Highly recommended--a part of history frequently neglected in the high drama of the Holocaust...the acts and near total destruction OF Hitler's \\"Christian Navy\\" is also an important piece of a puzzling and dark 12 years of human history.	2004-03-31

Certainly there are many pathways, and fewer pathways to success.  For example who would have thought that the story of the Passion might become a billion dollar success?  Tens of hundreds of years after it was written?<br />So comes the author Patrick O'Brian.  Shortly before his death in 1997, Professor Robert Herman of the University of Texas at Austin (Physics and Engineering), one of the very last Renaissance men of his generation, brought O'Brian to my attention.  Mind you, Dr. Herman was well-versed in all of the classics, in original Russian, German, French, English, and perhaps more.  An it was &quot;Master and Commander&quot; that he brought to my attention as a great work of literature.  So, naturally I bought the book, and read it--in the pre-film edition.  Never did I dream this would become a successful film starring the Oscar-winning Russell Crowe, whom I'd come to respect years before &quot;Gladiator&quot;.  A great combination.  I would not review the film here...however, anyone who has not seen the film, but wishes to read a truly great work in English literature of the 20th century, must become familiar with Patrick O'Brian, and I cannot find a better work with which to begin!!!<br />Highly recommended, readable, a page turner.  Like many such works, the film is not only in another genre, but must be judged by different standards.  By any standard, this is a book to be read, re-read, and given as a gift to any appreciator of great fiction on a grand scale!!!	2004-03-27

This is why it seems now so easy for politicians to \\"rewrite\\" history to their own agendas, including phases such as Vietnam specifically and the Cold War generally.  Fewer and fewer know how it even came about--how one of our staunchest Allies agains the Third Reich could so quickly become our primary nemesis in the seeming battle for world domination and influence--or as I was taught--hegemony.<br />Burrows focuses on the brave soldiers who were on the front lines of intelligence gathering.  These were the men who \\"accidentally\\" flew over Soviet air space, to get a glimpse of weapons systems, troop movements, and the military-industrial complex of the U.S.S.R.  This work is well-documented and fascinating.  The great human toll of this work is clear with a section before the endnotes, with names of those deceased in this important work.<br />These silent and shadow missions went on continually, punctuated only by foreign touting of a plane shot down, a flier captured.  Such was our fear of \\"re-education\\" that the film the Manchurian Candidate could not be shown for decades, fear that our government might be infiltrated by \\"turned\\" Americans.<br />That was not fantasy, however, for there were plenty of \\"turncoats\\" to go around, as we now know so well---turncoats purchase with easy money and the desire for conspicuous wealth.  HOwever, the silent observers of the aerial intelligence war could not dream of such rewards, only of carrying out their duties in the name of freedom.  As such, this book belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who takes the great conflicts of the 20th century seriously, for they are prologue to the murkier conflicts of the 21st.  Will these tactics only be frozen in time, abandoned as surely as the Napoleonic tactics of the early 19th century?  The short history of the 21st century, thus far, does not provide the answer.  However, as is so often said, those who do not learn from history may be condemned to repeat it.  To the extent the post-WWII period truly differed from present day, we can and should learn from it.

Weiner, Ph.D.).  I too am recently descended from immigrants (paternal I know more about).  And, I grew up believing in the education system in America, and that through hard work, adhering to traditional values, one could embark upon the American Dream.  In my time, however, that dream has soured considerably.<br />I first became most aware of this after earning my doctorate at another prestigious University, and finding many options closed to me, the trained scholar-scientist.  Then, I happened up Dinesh D'Sousa's &quot;An Illiberal Education.&quot;  Since my alma mater turned out to be one of the leading institutions working behind the scenes to deconstruct the &quot;Canon&quot; of the important works of Western Civilization, and replace them with the study of &quot;equally significant&quot; works from other parts of the world, I saw the underpinnings of American traditions crumbling under my feet.  My dissertation advisor had cautioned that I would be subjected to scholarly and ad hominem attacks by those wishing to see if I had &quot;clay feet.&quot; However, even he, quite a renaissance figure in his own right (and therefore anathema to modern liberal education), did not forsee what was coming.<br />Dr. Savage has seen it, and clearly. Some who listen to him on the radio, or read his recent works, may be surprised to find that the origins of the destruction of American Civilisation lie in the leftist, communist, fellow-traveling figures of the 1930s, but it does not surprise me.  One only need study the history of the State Department during Franklin Roosevelt's administration, or in Truman's, and the likes of John Foster Dulles, to find the origins of the destruction of our civilization go back even further, to Woodrow Wilson, and those who would make that Princeton professor King.<br />Dr. Savage does some preaching to the choir here, and a glossary might have been helful for the Tenderfeet (e.g. RDDB--Red Diaper Doper Babies....&quot;the stench from the bench is making me clench&quot;).  These are minor issues.  The strength of the work lies in his fine analytical mind, and ability to lay out for the reader his main theses--summarized in the words &quot;Borders, Language, Culture.&quot;  To wit -- without firm national borders, a common language (English), a common culture (American) -- this nation will no sustain itself through the current crises and the crises to come.<br />Dr. Savage knows the Socratic method well...just listen to an exchange with a caller on a radio broadcast (I believe he is currently 3rd in the number of radio stations in the U.S. carrying his 3 hour show from San Francisco, the ground central of the collapse of our society, he might say).  If you cannot think clearly, you may be hung up on.  Rude, you say?  In my training, I was told that one must hold firm to a didactic position in order to embark on any fruitful dialogue.  You must know and choose your adversaries well.  In this, Dr. Savage makes clear where he stands. Yet, he can still wax nostalgic about meals in his mother's kitchen in the Bronx, or let us in on his private dialogue with the members of the North End Italian Club in Boston -- a neighborhood with which I'm also familiar, and I have spent many an evening in similar neighborhoods around the country.  Would that there were more of them remaining!  Yesterday, even Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, just south of one of our greatest communities of Italian heritage, crumbled under the drive for &quot;progress.&quot;  Well, Pilgrim, it isn't all progress.  However, let no one ever doubt--we are all Americans first.<br />Can America be saved? The assault on many fronts is well entrenched.  I don't really know, nor could I predict.  Yesterday I went in to a local Austin bookstore, not a national chain, and could not find a single copy of this best seller on display.  If you believe we are in a fight for the preservation of our civilisation, then you are part of a silent majority that must begin to speak louder--louder than listening to a radio show, whose ratings engender an incessant barrage of inane commercial interruptions.  We need to get serious.  Dr. Savage's &quot;Paul Revere Society&quot; could be such a vehicle...however, more Americans will need to wake up and hear, of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.

Alpher planned, but affordable.  The dustjacket has been incorporated into a durable cover, and could now be used in a course on the History of Science, Astrophysics and Cosmology, or related subject.<br /><br />Ralph A. Alpher received overdue recognition with the 2005 National Medal of Science, our country's highest scientific award.  This was, in the opinion of a great many, long overdue.  I am his son, but my bias can be ignored.<br /><br />If you're interested in the Big Bang, I can tell you, there is more to come.  What happened before that singularity?<br /><br />After the Big Bang--well, there is no better description that that written by the man who described it, who calculated all of the important equations on a slide rule!  I wasn't there, but I was close--he is, after all, my father.<br /><br />And, when I was ten, this very humble scientist, considered by many one of the great scientists of the 20th century, had his predictions of the cosmic blackbody background radiation confirmed by accident by two physicists working for the then Bell Labs in New Jersey.  Those two men received the Nobel Prize.  Not that Alpher and Herman were not nominated at times, frequently.  It just so happens the Nobel is never awarde to FOUR people.  Every other important Physics recognition--has gone to Alpher and Herman.<br /><br />However, the most original work was from Ralph A. Alpher.  A student of George Gamow, the colorful Russian physicist at George Washington University, this work was his SECOND doctoral dissertation.  The solution to the problem of his first dissertaiton was published before he could defend it.<br /><br />At his defense of this dissertation--there were news media, journalists, as well as his doctoral committee.  It was a public event, and even the great cartoonist Herblock published a cartoon relating to the most significant cosmological PREDICTION of the 20th century, perhaps in all of Astronomy up to that time.<br /><br />And that was confirmed, and as a trained scientist, I can say, that's a pretty nifty occurrence.  Robert Herman, coauthor of this book, was my father's constant intellectual companion from the 1940s through the 1990s.  Nonetheless, he is recognized as a coauthor, and Ralph A. Alpher would say deservedly so.  I can also say, it helps to have intellectual colleagues.<br /><br />I've read many, many other versions of this great story in cosmology over the years, and many of them are flatly wrong.  Ralph Alpher was certainly always available to tell his story, but this book became the crowning achievement.  I've read the proofs and the book itself, and I heartily endorse it, because is is a great story in science, although a bit heftier than \\"The Double Helix\\" by Watson and Crick about the race to find the code we now know as DNA.<br /><br />However, on the Big Bang, there was no particular race.  Yet today, we're on the verge of another great debate regarding creationism and the origin of man, and Clarence Darrow will possibly be watching in amusement. No doubt also will George Gamow.  And many Nobel prize winners have had the fortunate opportunity to know my father.<br /><br />Today, however, Dr. Alpher is working on that nagging question, what DID happen before the Big Bang.  Being a theoretical physicist, and tending to make predictions and hypothecate (after all, the atom was long merely a hypothetical particle)...well, confirmation of what is to come may take a little time.<br /><br />And, as usual, we can expect a little academic political intrigue as well.  This book sets that record as clearly as anyone at the source could.  And it is a work of passion, I can attest to that.<br /><br />A great read for anyone who thinks about our origins and our future.

Ralph Alpher was certainly always available to tell his story, but this book became the crowning achievement.  I've read the proofs and the book itself, and I heartily endorse it, because is is a great story in science, although a bit heftier than \\"The Double Helix\\" by Watson and Crick about the race to find the code we now know as DNA.    However, on the Big Bang, there was no particular race.  Yet today, we're on the verge of another great debate regarding creationism and the origin of man, and Clarence Darrow will possibly be watching in amusement. No doubt also will George Gamow.  And many Nobel prize winners have had the fortunate opportunity to know my father.    Today, however, Dr. Alpher is working on that nagging question, what DID happen before the Big Bang.  Being a theoretical physicist, and tending to make predictions and hypothecate (after all, the atom was long merely a hypothetical particle)...well, confirmation of what is to come may take a little time.    And, as usual, we can expect a little academic political intrigue as well.  This book sets that record as clearly as anyone at the source could.  And it is a work of passion, I can attest to that.    A great read for anyone who thinks about our origins and our future.  Highly recommended.	2004-02-23

It is much more--a hopeful book which, frankly, would have been unnecessary in my young adulthood.  With a good high school education, it would have been difficult in the 1950s and 1960s to emerge without some clarity of social etiquette and consciousness.  In many areas of life, the FAUX PAS would have been as obvious in rural Georgia as in cosmopolitan San Francisco.<br />Now as we're circling the drain of the multicultural polyglot, Mollod and Tesauro propose to get us on some sort of consensual track--or tack, for the sailboaters among us.  And even better, they encourage you to THINK about the etiquette, not merely to follow in lock-step some propositions.<br />Quite frankly, their book encourages one to think of past behavior and dalliances in some perspective as well.  As we keep hearing today across the media...people don't vote on what happened 30 years ago.  A great proponent of that view, and of baseball Spring Training, is the taciturn George Will.  However, in a sense, he is wrong.  For example, in the section \\"Leaves of Grass\\" they encourage the reader not simply to admit past use of recreational drugs, but to examine the social and spiritual context in which such use may have occurred.  This would have been much more clarifying, for example, than a recent President's simple statement \\"I didn't inhale\\"--not exactly deep thinking about the period of rampant marijuana use.<br />Or, consider lying.  Here are examined all kinds of \\"lies\\"--frpom the \\"[S]mall departures from hand-on-the-Bible testimonials\\" to the \\"tumorous canards (which are) buildups of small and mid-sized lies, a Gordian knot of untruth\\"....the \\"aftermath includes disappointment, scorned trust, and torched friendships.\\"<br />The book is a jolly read.  I encourage women to read it, for it contains cunning insight into the modern male psyche.  Better yet, they might consider giving it to and studying it with a potential fiance!  As we all know, couples' individual identities tend to become blurred with time, and women have much stake in their male counterparts' behaviors!  Consider for example, the advice \\"When others are basking in a moment of grandeur, do not engage in one-upmanship simply to tout vast experience.\\"<br />Superlative advice--of course a woman would naturally avoid such alpha-male hill-climbing.  However, the unreflective alpha male, with trophies on his office wall, golf balls displayed from the world over in a walnut case, or photographs of his Cessna might also consider that these are not simply \\"conversation starters.\\"<br />I enjoyed the read thoroughly.  On the cover, is displayed a graphic of a man wearing a had--a 50s hat, not a fedora, with a line drawn to it denoting it [fig. a] (sic).  Hurrah.  Will crinolines and elbow gloves be next for women?  They already are--on the runways of New York in early 2004.  I think we'll all be the better for it, although the \\"dress for success\\" admonitions of John Malloy in the 1970s never really were discredited, even in a place such as Austin, where ball caps (or gimme caps, as the women call them), t-shirts, and sandals (Oh, grotesque!

Based on a series of letters between James McNeil, who rises through the ranks of the 101st New York Volunteers and loved ones at home, Ms. McLain has brought to life an amazing triumph of the 19th Century--the bonding of people across space and time, that transcended the meager technology of the period.  It is touching, real, and poignant as 3,000 men die each week across a 200 week war....<br />Why read it?  Today, we are again involved in a War that will define our national identity, and the personal identity of Americans from coast to coast.  In 1865, the United States was on the verge of fulfilling the concept of its Manifest Destiny to unite a land from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.  Are we fulfilling a manifest destiny now?  Are we defending our nation from enemies foreign and domestic, as sworn by our President, the Commander in Chief, the same oath sworn to by Abraham Lincoln, and the members of our Armed Forces.  Does that oath EVER terminate.<br />Today, the battle came only once to our soil, some 3,000 died one time.  Compare this to the Civil War.  Today, cellphones and e-mails bring the front closer to home, however, than the stone walls at Fredericksburg or Gettysburg could ever come to New York.  And yet, in the words conceived by the authoress McLain, they are close, perhaps closer.<br />You don't have to be particularly interested in the Civil War per se to find this first novel intriguing, moving, and remarkable.  I was fortunate to purchase this book from the author at a meeting of the Austin Civil War Roundtable--which one might think of as unfriendly turf.  However, even the many Texans in this group recognize the universality of the feelings, images, stories, and effect on families of WAR.  War is constant globally--somewhere, all the time.  Ms. McLain's work of devotion to the study of the human dimension is a fine offering.<br />Highly recommended!!	2004-02-22

I will not used the vulgar words and diatribe thrown in Dr. Savage's direction.  Have we no perspective?  A man this brilliant comes along once in a very long time.  He is an incisive and clear thinker, consistent yet flexible.  Has anyone read any of the 20 or so academic works that came before two bestsellers written within one year?  As an academically trained scholar, I can see the difference.  That he can move from one style to the other, from talking about vitamins, medicinal plants and herbs on the one hand, to passionate persuasion that our current President has lost touch with the people who elected him, to talking about Cadillacs and the fantasies of lost youth, to singing &quot;Volare&quot; on the air...does no one recognize a Renaissance Man in this wilderness called America.<br />Sure, his real name, and the copyright on his book is Michael A. Savage, Ph.D.  He's not hiding behind that!  He is a blue collar white collar American, self-made in a way few attain.  If anyone's life is an open book, from Longfellow Avenue in the Bronx to Marin County, his is.  The books, the radio show, the risky switch from a 50,000 watt station to KNEW at age 60...come on, folks!  Where's your sense of perspective?<br />Despite his defense of the family, tonight he left a descendant of Gaugin with the question, in the gist of it:  So, had he remained a family man and stockbroker and not left his family for the Tropics and his painting, we'd not have his brilliant artwork.  Which would be better?  The caller was hoping she had not married such a man.  Savage advocates a traditional, straight and narrow lifestyle, but he'd hardly deny that the tapestry of America has always had a warp and a woof.<br />Dr. Savage challenges you to think.  And it is very, very hard work to think clearly.  Let us be grateful, and leave the AD HOMINEM (you may have to look this up) attacks at home.	2004-02-21
US	50753742	R3SYZKAEZBFY5Q	0142001589	771800527	Interrogations: The Nazi Elite in Allied Hands, 1945	Books	5	10	14	N	Y	"Banality of Evil" is not for Everyone	This is clearly an essential book for anyone interested in the Third Reich, the Holocaust or Shoah.  Simply put, in their own words, rationalizations, justifications, and mystifications of the \\"Elite\\" leaders of the Reich, on trial at Nuremberg.  Apparently well-treated, some were seemingly quite frank about their coming under the F&uuml;hrer's hypnotic spell and seeming to lose their own will, few apologetic and even fewer aware of the need to explain to the next generation of Germans what had transpired during the 13 year, not the 1,000 year, Reich.  At least Dr. Goebbels, the master propagandist, had the foresight to spare his descendants the psychic pain and murdered his whole family before taking his own life.<br />It is acknowledged that Hitler placed into prominent positions persons with little or no background or experience in their positions of authority or domains (Ribbentrop was a champagne dealer, Heydrich a disgraced WWI Naval officer who became head of the SS non-Reich territories and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, or Czechloslovakia), placing his utmost confidence in them.  And how could their have been people with \\"experience\\" in his ultimate aims, the domination of Europe and extermination of European Jewry?  He had many men scurrying to act as they knew what they were doing, learning on the job, so to speak, and that, if anything, rings clear.  Do you, the reader, remember a first job where you feared it would be found out you were a pretender, a fraud, a newbie?  Imagine being given an entry-level job in command of thousands of slave laborers, displaced persons to be worked to the last pfennig of their worth and then destroyed, fed only enough to eek out that last pfennig of work...on the gate of many of the concentration camps (Konzentrationslagen) one sees the inscription ARBEIT MACHT FREI. I have seen the gate at Sachsenhausen, just north of Berlin, and used by the Soviets and East Germans as a prison for many years after the war.  Usually this is translated as \\"work will make you free.\\"  I have understood a different meaning, a distinctly Germanic one.  Arbeit--Work; Macht--Power; Frei--Unconfined....from my 1939 German dictionary.  For, as we know, freedom is an American concept.  Those three words were, at best, double entrendre or propaganda.  As understood by Germans in the SS, a wholly different meaning was conveyed.<br />In a country where the Abitur (high school diploma) was looked upon as we in America might look upon a Master's Degree today, men of only elementary education took up the leadership in many aspects of the classless German society which Hitler sought to create.  Of course, few such men went through the indoctrination of the Labor Service, mandatory for all young men issued spades to drill with instead of guns, the Hitler youth, or the concept of the Lebensborn (children born out of wedlock for the F&uuml;hrer).<br />All of these schemes, when shone under the light of day for the world to see, were doomed to failure.  Yet the Elite seemed never to grasp this fact.  They pursued their aims with whatever efficiency was possible, a German tradition.  The trains ran in a timely manner nearly till the absolute end of the war, even after the massive bombings of major cities and bridges.  Hugo Boss continued to design revisions in the war uniforms to account for shortages in quality material.<br />This is an essential book for a library on the 20th Century--not a \\"read\\" but a true reference work.  What Germany and the European Union aspire to, and will become, has passed through the mind of Adolph Hitler and his collaborators, into the minds of the descendants of the \\"T&auml;ter\\" und \\"Opfern\\" (German for the perpetrators and the victims--to which the Germans now include the victims of Allied strategic bombing of civilian population centers).<br />As sure as the Persian Gulf Wars I and II were initiated in our national interest, understanding of the perpetrators of the various atrocities, and, as we know, in some cases exceptions, of the all-important period from the Treaty of Versailles to the end of hostilities in May, 1945 in Europe are part of the prologue to the 21st century.  Some find history dull and heavy, but like the Law, history has a long grasp.<br />Read this book.  More than once!  My highest recommendation., as we know, in some cases exceptions, of the all-important period from the Treaty of Versailles to the end of hostilities in May, 1945 in Europe are part of the prologue to the 21st century.

Weiner, Ph.D. a/k/a Michael Savage, talk show host from San Francisco, California...literate, clear, erudite.  Dr. Savage is an important voice in the wilderness of AM radio \\"political entertainment\\" and this book serves as a hornbook for the year 2004, ironically, the Chinese Year of the Monkey.  However this IS NOT just another in the stream of \\"political\\" books, and Dr. Savage challenges thinking much more than he entertains.<br />Dr. Savage takes on one of the most difficult concepts facing the United States today:  What is an American?  If we put the \\"Native American\\" agenda in its own category--they were really \\"pre-Americans\\" although their descendants can certainly claim the identity \\"American\\".  Dr. Savage, well-educated researcher with doctorate from the great University of California at Berkeley, has distilled these elements down to three--Borders, Language, and Culture.<br />Secure borders, primacy of the English language, and assimilation into the mainstream traditional American democratic, capitalist, individualist, heterosexual, Judeo-Christian is, as he sees it, the great agenda conceived of by the Founding Fathers of this nation, and protected with the Constitution, tricamerate Federal government, and Bill of Rights. <br />Many have risked the last full measure of their devotion to their dreams to come to America and assimilate.  The \\"multicultural\\" New America is clearly NOT Michael Savage's America.  The America that will not allow the Boy Scouts--through the Red Diaper Doper Babies (attorneys) of the American Civil Liberties Union (fox in sheep's clothing) to camp or run activities on \\"government\\" property--having won the right to promote its priniciples in Government Courts....is the false America.  <br />This nation of three hundred million in a world of five billion needs, so Savage argues, to get back to attending to its own business.  And THE ENEMY WITHIN traces the erosion of taking care of business back to the 1960s, and names names.  I believe any reasonably intelligent, literate, open-minded person will benefit through reading Savage's analyses.  Those who listen to Dr. Savage will see that, contrary to what they may have HEARD, he has an open mind to reasoned arguments.  <br />Dr. Savage forsees a great danger of a Fascist America.  So, younger readers, who do not know Fascism's many cloaks, may need to read beyond and ask questions.  For many decades, Fascism was to many German Nazism.  However, it is not.  It is a system in which the government regulates information and thought, and propaganda is its greatest instrument.  And propaganda is the talent of the many who would reduce America to just some other country, not a country that rose to greatness in less than 200 years, and has been capable of bringing down its most threatening external foes.  However, the enemies within--those who would turn the structure of the nation to rubble, to communism, socialism, fascism, will require retrenched and thoughtful patriotism, not merely flag waving.  I see this as the most important message of this book, and I recommend it highly to Americans or would-be Americans most highly.	2004-02-19

It must have had something to do with those Half-Mammals or the Confederate in the Attic...<br />If you are a Southerner, this book will ring with truth, because Mr. Singleton's characters are so obviously around the block, if not next door.  If you know that prosperity can be measured in the number of cars you have up on blocks in the FRONT yard, you're in the neighborhood.  If you're afraid to get of I-95 between the Virginia border and Florida, or I-10 between the Louisiana border and Houston, this is the book for you.  Or, if you took I-64 thinking you'd go through West Virginia and turned around where it ended (Fie, Senator Byrd!)...you need to get right with Dixie.<br />I could hardly recommend Mr. Singleton's stories higher--up with Confederates in the Attic (nonfiction), or Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (possibly fiction).  His characters refer to Nietzche, get regular calls from the FBI and John Walsh, or play 20 questions as a marital ritual, or find themselves thinking about cosines, and sines for &quot;no reason in particular.&quot;  And, they tend to think of lead pipes for uses not related to who did what to whom in the drawing room.  They have no clue, but they're right on.<br />I highly recommend you get into this book, and it compares in frankness with Walker Percy, without the I Went to Medical School in New York puttin' on airs.

I heartily endorse this textbook in basic economics for the literate American, and for any reader who wishes to analyze and understand ANY economy.  Why should we care?  We saw the economy of the LARGEST nation (the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) collape completely only fifteen or so years ago.  What followed is chaos that few Americans, perhaps save legal immigrants, can understand.  And in our country, the United States of America, where we all rely on a food distribution system that, if shut down, would leave grocery store shelves empty in three days, ALL of us should know more about economics--supply and demand, or, as Sowell might say, resources and prices.  How much more would you pay for a FIVE day supply of food after a unthinkable disruption of distribution.  Sowell will help you think clearly about such questions.<br />Can you name ONE Nobel Prize Winner in Economics?  And if you can, why it was earned?  I would suggest the Thomas Sowell, in making the complexities (which are really not so complex) CLEAR in PLAIN ENGLISH of Economics ought to receive at least a Pulitzer for his writing, if not the Nobel for succint clarity.<br />WHY don't more editors (in every media type) make this book mandatory for reporters, investigators and researchers?  It should be.  The analytic mind demands some model for reasoning out problems of the allocation of resources, whether they be animal, vegetable, or mineral.<br />This book, cheaper than even a Community College course in Economics, will be called back for re-reading many times by anyone who cares about freedom, liberty, and prosperity, whether that person thinks of him or herself as liberal, moderate, independent, conservative, or libertarian.  I recommend:  BUY this book.  And then, please read it!	2004-02-17

Benjamin is little remembered for his service to the United States of America, the Confederate States of America, and the United Kingdom.  Born in the West Indies, he ended his life as Queen's Counsel in Great Britain.  In between, he came to Charleston, South Carolina, studied law in New Orleans, became the first Jewish Senator--from antebellum Louisiana.  Surprised? I was.  Then, service as Attorney General, Secretary of War, and Secretary of State of the Confederate States of America.  Almost universally well-liked and respected, the &quot;smiling lion&quot; whose face adorns every Confederate $2 bill (you can check your collection); this was a most remarkable Victorian American, in all respects.<br />Frequently the brunt of castigation in newspapers for problems with military supply and ordnance, probably trailing close behind Jefferson Davis (also a former U.S. Senator) himself, this book is a very intriguing and documented biography.  Sadly now out of print, I still highly recommend it to any student of the Civil War, the Confederacy, the history of Jews in America, jurisprudence (he wrote a book on Contracts that is still important in the United Kingdom)...he should not be forgotten.  Judah P. Benjamin was a spirited man who made the most of his talents (even marrying into Catholic New Orleans aristocracy) and yet is known by few, and probably understood by even fewer.<br />He is as much a part of American history and identity as Robert E.

And he is not the only former NSDAP member nor SS-Man to live in the United States.<br />From the number of reviews written about this book (a good read also)--33 at last count, if you are interested in the World War II, the Holocaust, the Great Patriotic War, the European Union of the 21st Century, this is a must read.  I say this not because I agree with Herr Schmidt's attitudes, nor his version of \\"history\\", but because he is one who put to paper thoughts of many of his compatriots.  It is in English, and he writes in English well--no obfuscation from translation.<br />He presents a rather rosy view of a childhood in the Saarland, reunification with Germany by plebescite, the state of Germany following the Treaty of Versailles, and the pride in a country rebuilt from the ashes of the War to End all Wars (that was the first one).<br />Herr Schmidt does not provide, frankly, much context for his writing, and that is the major flaw of the book.  It simply cannot be read alone--one must have knowledge of, or pursue knowledge of, the context in which a young man born in 1927 could find himself running errands during the Battle of the Bulge, the last great German offensive of the war, to have been at (so he says) so many important places during this time in the winter of 1944-1945 in the Ardennes, and lived to tell about it.<br />I ask anyone who is interested in this type of personal memoir to compare it to, say, memoirs of Union and Confederate soldiers of their experiences during the American Civil War, of Jews who survived (or as in the case of Anne Frank, did not survive) the Holocaust.  Everyone knew the program of the \\"Final Solution\\" or had access to it, for example.  \\"Mein Kampf\\" was given to every newly married couple in Germany.

This is incredulous, and disturbing.  He mentions that the first Jew he knew was a doctor who cared for him during childhood.<br />While the Greatest Generation in America is dying off at a rate of 1,000 to 2,000 per DAY, that generation of Germans and Europeans is meeting the same fate.

Anyone who might wonder why Jews would fight for the Confederacy, or Blacks for that matter, will find this fascinating.  Jews from South Carolina, from Louisiana, many of German or Spanish (Sephardic) heritage, were there.  I hope that more books, and personal accounts, will follow, from groups whose support for the rights of the States to determine their destinies will be forthcoming.  We must learn from history.<br />Anyone who would hope to understand what it means to be an American should have this book on the shelf, and read it.  To paraphrase Shelby Foote, before this war, the United States could only be conceived of as a plurality, after, a singularity.  Yet today, we are no doubt in danger of falling into an abyss of pluralism that threatens any kind of national identity.  Yet Irishmen fought one another--at Fredericksburg, and elsewhere--as did Jews, and Blacks, and Hispanics--across stone walls at point-blank range, leaving a legacy of maiming of soul and flesh.  We have only to look back 3 score years to the bloodbath of Europe to see we are not yet free.<br />Jews fought for home and hearth, &quot;Pro Aris et Pro Focis&quot;--a common Latin phrase embroidered on flags North and South.  In the American South, many Jews found that was worth fighting for against an invasion from afar.  That experience unites them with us, today.<br />Most highly recommended for scholarship and readability!	2004-02-15

Although a sequel to his book Basic Economics, this book stands well alone.  In it, he tackles the current problems in this country involving the interaction of the political climate with basic economic principles.  These include health care, housing, discrimination, risk, and the problems afflicting so-called third-world nations in economic development.<br />He takes an interesting historical perspective.  For example, his analysis of slavery through the ages, and during the period of the American Colonies and southern United States is particularly cogent, and still of contemporary interest. How could slavery have survived so long?  Was there such a variety of slave &quot;status&quot; and freedoms to act as has recently been portrayed, even in such films as &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot;.  During this film, a complicated relationship between General Thomas J. Jackson and his personal cook is portrayed.  They have discussions during which it is clear that the slave's status as a well-known cook, and his desire to defend HIS home from invasion as much as Jackson's is remarkable.  Within Sowell's analysis of the antebellum South, it is not difficult to understand.  In fact, he describes a situation in which slaves were put in less &quot;risky&quot; labor positions than Irish immigrants, a situation derived from their economic value in a cotton baling and transport operation.<br />I probably have not seen an economic &quot;page turner&quot; since reading George Gilder's &quot;Wealth and Poverty&quot; which was so important to understanding the Reagan era (it was, evidently, the &quot;Bible&quot; of many men responsible for early decisions during the Reagan administration and essential to understanding so-called supply-side economics).<br />I recommend this book highly.

The writer is a nonacademic historian by reputation, possibly a journalist by profession.  Mr. Douglas relies on material not generally available, some available through the Freedom of Information Act or FOIA, one of the legacies of the Watergate Scandal of the 1970s.  Much of the material are translations--and the reader must rely on them.  In addition, we find a man here, born in 1900 (THAT appears noncontroversial).  He began his career as a policeman in Bavaria, yet rose to the highest position of authority in the Gestapo (Geheimstaatspolizei) or Internal Reich Security in the Third Reich.<br />Those appear to be undisputed facts.  However, what happened to Heinrich M&uuml;ller after the War is a matter of conjecture.  Following the narrative established by Douglas, General M&uuml;ller's post-war career is nothing short of remarkable, and worthy of an extremely intelligent, worldly, and clever man.  Some have attempted to discredit the works as simply inconsistent for a man who previously appeared unremarkable.  I would suggest to the reader, however, that a 45 year old man, sprung at the end of a lifetime of wars, uncertainty, and rise to great power, might just be on the threshold of capitalizing on a lifetime of observation and learning from the great masters of deception, megalomania, and conversion of disgrace to respectability (on their terms), public admiration, and generation of fear.  These are, I suggest, the qualities upon which General M&uuml;ller may have been prepared to initiate a postwar career, one born of the boredom of 3 years lived in obscurity, and the OSS-CIAs need for a crash-course in anti-communist networking, knowledge of operatives, and ability to guide those privy to the coming new world order of the last half of the 20th century.  This, according to the material presented, and the brief commentaries from Mr. Douglas, is exactly the bold move that General M&uuml;ller sought to commence.<br />While I will not claim to be an historical expert, I do find the presentation credible from a life-history perspective, and one of the development of personal identity across the life span.  Heinrich M&uuml;ller, above any others alive toward the end of World War II, was in a position to prepare himself for a productive post-war life.  He aspired to greater power, self-presentation of worldly knowledge and character, and was in a position to work for the most congenial authority that would set him up in a protected and powerful place of influence.<br />That place may just have been the United States.  The interviews ring authentically of a man of his origins and stealthy rise under Himmler and Heidrich.  He only joined the Party quite late in his career with the SS.  This book, and others in the series, should serve as an object lesson for anyone who believes that we do NOT really know what happened at the end of the War, following Eisenhower's halt at the Elbe (see Udo Pfleghar's fascinating book on that subject, \\"Br&uuml;ckenkopf Zerbst\\", Anhaltische Verlagsgesellschaft mbH Dessau, 1998).<br />Under the methods of administration of the Freedom of Information Act (the exceptions should be read by every American!) and the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, we may never know in great detail the activities of M&uuml;ller, who was dropped from the search for Nazi War Criminals sought internationally in 1960.  Yes, 1960.  Were General M&uuml;ller still alive, he would be 103. Those who knew him will be protected because of that contact in perpetuity as will their confidants, informants, and families.  Having myself seen official copies of many of the documents presented here, we can only hope that for the sake of history and freedom, that the trail is followed by able truth-seekers.  That these books of Mr. Douglas seem unchallenged by credible sources, I suggest they should be reprinted, and thereby become more widely available as in the manner of Professor Richard J. Evans' critique of David Irving's \\"outside of academia\\" works in the book \\"Lying About Hitler\\" (Basic Books paperback, 2001).  Herr M&uuml;ller is as interesting a figure to come out of the Third Reich as any whose lives have been examined with penetrating questions about the limits of human motivation.eby become more widely available as in the manner of Professor Richard J.

The previous line is something you see frequently in German literature...the on and on sentence, with the point (or the verb) at the end....hence as one professor told me, the \\"AHA\\"  or Gestalt experience....<br />Nonetheless, Professor Evans, being a credentialed tenured scholar, has an amply (and I mean nearly sentence by sentence) footnoted bibliography, given the indulgence to take a great deal of time, and use research assistants, to investigate Irving's work.  At one point, he finds ample justification to ignore Irving's work prior to about 1987...and later, about 1992.  This has to do with the publication (and in many languages) of the 2nd edition (which did not get translated into as many languages) of Irving's book about Adolf Hitler.  Irving, an \\"independent\\" historian, had assuredly given perhaps misguided credit to some of his source material, which Professor was able to uncover, and attack dispassionately.<br />I personally quarrel with neither writer.  Also, Evans explains well why such a libel suit was possible in England yet would never occur (dare we thank Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and George Washington for the difference between our legal system and England, despite our 20th and 21st century alliances?)...The point is, they show the inherent flaw in all historical research and method.  If YOU cannot read or check the sources, you are reading INTERPRETATION.  When another language is involved, you take on a double risk of being misled.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, recently elected governor of California (and he can never become President, because he is a naturalized citizen), experienced similar attacks of his statements when he was 25 years old about Adolf Hitler, out of context.  He said he admired a man (yes he was also clearly an evil man) who rose from poverty to the highest political echelons of his era--and now, so has Mr. Schwarzenegger.  What was revealed only within 24 hours of the election, after the Associated Press sent presumably biligual (I don't know) reporters to Austria (or so I heard on the \\"unbiased\\" news), and they found Jews in Mr. Schwartzenegger's home town who not only praised his philanthropy toward Jews in their town in Austria, but recalled he fought neo-Nazis in the streets as a teenager.  WHY he did that (given that his father was a party member at one time) is not relevant.  What is relevant--and here comes MY BIAS, is the contextual nature of so-called FACTS.<br />THAT is the lesson of Professor Evans' work, the books of Irving, and any book written with the intent to make money.

Yet, this patented machine, devised by a little-known man of German descent, made it possible to conduct a census in a short time period, and turned counting into a tool useful on a mass scale.  Black's book is a page-burner, containing information that will surprise the reader paragraph by paragraph.  In my generation, the \\"Do Not Spindle, Fold, or Mutilate\\" written on each IBM punchcard was the introduction to the computer and information age (and often the butt of jokes).  A scant 25 to 30 years earlier, similar punch cards became the currency on which the Holocaust was based.  A truly groundbreaking piece of research that, fortunately, has already appeared in German translation.  In the days where vast amounts of personal information are being reduced to a series of ones and zeros carried electronically and stored digitally, this saga may be the harbinger of horrors much worse than were conceived by the progenitors of the 1000-year Reich.  We should pay close attention to the uses of such personal information, lest humans lose complete control of their humanity.

The author's father was a diesel mechanic lost at sea in his 13th operational U-Boat tour.  Individual submarines rarely made war patrols in the double digits before succumbing to sinking or debilitation; at the end of the war, most were scuttled by their crews.<br />In addition to numerous color and black and white photographs, color reproductions of panels from the 5th U-Boat Flotilla's visitor's book, along with statistics on individual U-Boat crews (survivors, war patrols, killed in action) bring the reader fairly close to a variety of experiences common to all submariners (e.g. rituals for crossing the equator, training trials, experiences on leave, the social climate of the bases).<br />This is no glorification of the Third Reich--if anything, it shows, like the film Das Boot (highly recommended), the isolation and challenges of maintaining a no-frills environment in which a crew of usually 45 or so men, from officers to diesel mechanics, had to maintain operational readiness in the context of long periods of dull routine punctuated by brief periods of extreme violence and fear of death--something like laying across a subway railway track with no knowledge of the time of the coming of the next train, and a screwdriver with which to attempt to derail it.<br />From this came initial notoriety of great accomplishment early in the war (measured by tonnage sunk), to near suicide missions by 1943, when Allied radar, sonar, and bombing was too much for these vessels that could mainly do battle only when surfaced and powered by diesel engines, and when submerged had to operate primarily on recharged electric motors (until the addition of the \\"schnorchel\\" which allowed use of diesel engines while still submerged).<br />As a stand-alone work, it is neither exhaustive nor definitive, but within a collection of war diaries, film, and other analyses of performance may give one the sense of opportunity given to men from many different backgrounds to merge into a fighting unit, with a much greater than 50/50 chance of certain death.  It shows again how, in wartime, soldiers are fighting for each other as much as for any ethereal cause other than survival.other analyses of performance may give one the sense of opportunity given to men from many different backgrounds to merge into a fighting unit, with a much greater than 50/50 chance of certain death.

First of all, anyone interested in submarine warfare will find this a well-documented and constructed account of the development and use of submarines within the Kriegsmarine (KM) by the Germans during World War II.  Like most books from the Naval Institute Press, among them the highly-sought first edition of Clancy's \\"The Hunt for Red October\\", one would be hard put to find flaws in the presentation.<br />The author does opine from the gathered data, much of it in the National Archives, that helps the reader track from year to year the rise and fall of the effectiveness of U-Boot (U-Boat) warfare, the reasons (especially increasingly effective Allied detection and bombing) for the end of the Battle of the Atlantic, and the failure of the unleashing of \\"total war\\" by Admiral Donitz.  The book is rich with German terminology, which will facilitate reader understanding of other books, and films such as \\"Das Boot\\".  For example, the term L.I. (pronounced el-ee in German) occurs frequently in that film, referring to the Chief Engineer (Lieutenant Engineer, on the Engineer track within the KM).<br />I find somewhat astounding one conclusion of the author, that most U-Boot sailors were German patriots and relatively unaware of the genocide occurring within the Reich.  Although there is dictum that der Fuehrer compained of having a \\"Christian Navy\\", frequent trips back to the Fatherland when on leave, trips to Berlin for decorations, and so forth would seem to make it incredulous that these men did not know what was happening within the Reich.  The author does not identify how many sailors in the U-Boot Waffe were NSDAP (Nazi Party) members, which would be a telling statistic.  He states that Germans at home were more concerned with obtaining food during the Allied bombing campaign, which has come under some revisionist criticism (\\"German's Revisit War's Agony, Ending a Taboo\\", Richard Bernstein, New York Times, Vol. CLII, No. 52423, March 15, 2003, p. A3).  However, this reviewer has studied the period 1918-1950 fairly extensively, and viewed in German newsreels shown in German theatres as early as 1940 which demonstrated the persecution of Jews and other \\"undesireables\\" and the unfolding of the plans stated in the book \\"Mein Kampf\\" (My Struggle), available in English in 1939.<br />Films such as \\"Das Boot\\" and \\"Stalingrad\\" do go a long way toward viewing the common soldier or sailor as somewhat of a victim of birth and citizenship.  Standards both mental and physical for U-Boat personnel were astoundingly stringent (even volunteers with dental caries were rejected).  These men fought in unimaginably deplorable conditions (no heat, one commode for a crew averaging 50, frequent exposure to the exhaust of diesel engines).  However, this book doesn't convey that kind of feeling, compared to, say, Werner's \\"Iron Coffins\\" (the recollections of a U-Boat commander).  Nonetheless, its statistical analysis is important--suggesting that upwards of 50,000 rather than the commonly accepted 40,000 sailors may have served on U-Boats.  The casualty rate (75% or so killed) belies grand fealty to a doomed and errant cause, but as with our own Confederates, we can nonetheless appreciate the valor and sacrifice with which they served \\"their\\" country.reviewer has studied the period 1918-1950 fairly extensively, and viewed in German newsreels shown in German theatres as early as 1940 which demonstrated the persecution of Jews and other \\"undesireables\\" and the unfolding of the plans stated in the book \\"Mein Kampf\\" (My Struggle), available in English in 1939.<br />Films such as \\"Das Boot\\" and \\"Stalingrad\\" do go a long way toward viewing the common soldier or sailor as somewhat of a victim of birth and citizenship.

First of all, the book Hart's War, written by John Katzenbach, son of Nicholas Katzenbach, the Attorney General in the Johnson Administration, differs in many ways from the resulting movie.  Each stands on its own, and my review of the movie stands.<br />The book is intriguing and will provide information which will enrich viewing the movie.  Details differ in many ways from the screenplay, which in this writer's view, is a good thing.  Some characters in the film are amalgamations of persons in the book, but the book is enriched with details that might pass one by in the audio-visual drama.  For example, the phrase \\"goon up\\" is only heard off-camera, except when spoken by Kommandant Visser, and his pronunciation sounds like \\"guten Abend\\" (I believe he is a Romanian actor, and a great cast for the characters of Visser and von Reiter in the book).  Another example, the term \\"kriegie\\" which POWs use for one another passes by very quickly in the movie, yet is a designation full of layers of meaning (based on the German word \\"Krieg\\").<br />It is not necessary to detail the plot--it is a murder mystery like the movie, but the tempo is quite different and the book itself is a masterpiece of historical fiction.	2002-10-14

A man of dubious background (possibly a Mischling or half-Jew by the Nuremberg definitions--see Dr. Bryan Mark Rigg's \\"Hitler's Jewish Soldiers\\"), he nonetheless was seen as essential to the cause by Adolf Hitler, and participated fully in the Endloesung (Final Solution) of the Judenfrage (Jewish question).  He presided over the first Wannsee conference (January 20, 1942) at which the definitions of partial Jews were discussed, as well as the \\"clearing\\" of Jews from ALL aspects of German life, including the living space of the Reich.  Heydrich was evidently energetic and enthusiastic about his work.  So much so, that he was eventually assassinated (shot and died from infection of his wounds) by Czech partisans airlifted into Czechosovakia (the Reichsprotektorate of Bohemia and Moravia), who were trained in Britain where there was an expatriate Czech army of resistance.<br />This is a dreadful work, and should be.

In fact, personalities like Heydrich, loyal but somewhat creative and inventive when it came to carrying out the orders or concepts of their superiors, seem to have viewed themselves as visionaries, influenced by their own propaganda.  Books such as this will bring them posthumously down to earth, but we'll understand more about the new ways of waging war that demanded entirely new concepts of crime and justice at the war's termination, to be applied to those who survived and could be found.  Without doubt, Heydrich would have emerged as a complex and confounding figure, and the story of his silencing rests upon an equally convoluted and twisting series of events.

Nearly two years after my initial review, there has not been a shred of credible refutation of Mr. Douglas' work.  Why?  The silence is as deafening as the roar of controversy since the shots rang out on Dealy Plaza until this book was published.<br /><br />My instincts tell me, if there were something to refute, it would have been heard.<br /><br />This is an outstanding work of nonfiction, which the reader may choose to take on faith.  Most of Mr. Douglas' work is based partly on Freedom of Information Act inquiries and other documentation made privately available to hims from such individuals as former deputy director Crowley of the CIA.  To his credit, Mr. Douglas does show reproductions of crucial documents, and the reader can judge the internal consistency of the material, cross-references, and the like.<br /><br />This book blows all previous theories of the assassination out of the water, in a subdued matter-of-fact manner, allowing the historical material to speak almost for itself.  In that regard, it is chilling.  For example, over 3,000 names of CIA \\"contacts\\" are reported by name, address, and zip code from Mr. Crowley's file.  Certain heretofore \\"taken-for-granted\\" aspects of the behaviour of Oswald, Ruby, and the Dallas Police are analyzed easily to lead to quite different conclusions from other conspiracy theory and the Warren Commission Report, which emerges as a work of political fiction generated to pacify a terrorized populace and nervous leadership.<br /><br />This will change how you think about the asssassination and other aspects of government, and the consequences of your voting (or your vote not being counted).  Your view of the purported democracy (or republic) you live in will change forever.  However, this is worth the equivalent of a night at the movies on the same subjects, or a matinee with popcorn, plus you can reread it and show it to your companions, friends, and enemies!<br /><br />November 2, 2016 update:  It hardly seems so long since I read and reviewed this book.  The reviews of Douglas' works are replete with charges of aliases, and supposed non-fulfillment of requests for meetings, microfilm, etc.  I was discouraged by the publisher of his M&uuml;ller books from contacting Douglas. I nontheless contacted him at an email address in Illinois, now defunct.  Looking back, I can imagine how much easier it was to fake primary identification at one time.  Yet not long ago, a photoshopped birth certificate was accepted as original even though thoroughly debunked, and rejected by an official of the state that supposedly issued the certificate.  As I suggested, reading this book might best be looked on as entertainment. It doesn't answer all questions, but later works, such as those of Jim Marrs, make Regicide<br />seem much more believable in part if not the whole, in which I'd expect errors.  We have government officials who have faked their CVs and remained in their jobs (my strongest recollection is of the person who headed a major agency in Houston, Texas).  I did ask for a photocopy of one of the documents used for the M&uuml;ller series.  His reply was that it was not possible as all material was being sent out of the country by private plane.  I did however manage to obtain a document on which the head of the New Mexico State University School of Journalism based his review of the first book in that series (1995).  I reported my analysis of that material elsewhere.  I'm not a professional authenticator of documents.<br /><br />Taken on its face, this rather early account of the multiple-agency multiple-actor theory of the Kennedy murder seemed to open doors or thought and research, in my view.  Many of the documents cited in the M&uuml;ller series have been purloined since the Interagency Work Group \\"assembled\\" material from many agencies and deposited them at the NARA facility at College Park (many were gone when I was there in 2004).  After the Berger affair (original classified documents removed from NARA), I believe that definitive works on controversial topics are going to be harder to authenticate.oversial topics are going to be harder to authenticate.	2002-08-20
US	50753742	REQUIJ3118471	0700611789	234379049	Hitler's Jewish Soldiers: The Untold Story of Nazi Racial Laws and Men of Jewish Descent in the German Military	Books	5	8	12	N	Y	It is a Must Book--Blazes a Vanishing Trail	For those of you who never considered that a book about persons of Jewish ancestry in WWII could change your views about the war, the 18th-20th centuries, the nature of prejudice in America, and do so with alarming alacrity, specificity, and clarlity, this book will astound you. Considering current problems in the Middle East, this volume, based on primary research interviews with \\"Mischlinge\\" (persons of Jewish ancestry who probably didn't consider themselves anything but good Germans), will break every assumption you can make about the War. You'll see the major figures, including Hitler, in a vastly different light--that is, he is merely one figure in a problem with its roots going back to the free German states of the 1700s, at least. Dr. Rigg goes to great lengths to show how the figures of the number of half and quarter Jews reported by the state don't add up at the beginning of the global war, that there were many ways that these individuals dealt with racial laws and their service to the Fatherland and Hitler, and that following the war they have struggled with intense psychological pain and inner conflict about their activities.<br />There is little doubt that there are many Americans suffering with similar problems. I won't detail them here--but the reader won't have any trouble finding the parallels. This book is amply documented, and Dr. Rigg's primary research materials, gathered at great expense and diligence in the 1990s, as the so-called Mischlinge were dying off daily, is a great testament to a work of great urgency, done carefully and presented systematically. His analysis is dispassionate--yet each page speaks with the passion of a the participants, their families and relatives. There is such irony here, such as the origin of the photo on the cover--the \\"poster boy\\" of the Aryan Wehrmacht (Army) soldier.<br />This is a timely period in our understanding of the World Wars, and the Cold War, as material involving the progenitors becomes available and declassified. This book will be an essential volume in the library of the sophisticated reader, war buff, and serious student of the 20th century. It is about so much more than the fate of Jews or partial Jews in the \\"thousand year Reich\\"...and makes all writing about the Wannsee Conference seem like a hornbook or primer rather than the defining word about the \\"Final Solution\\" (Endloesung) of the \\"Jewish Question\\" in Nazi Germany and its spheres of influence. In that regard, I strongly recommend the reader consider viewing the HBO DVD titled \\"Conspiracy\\" or the German Film \\"The Wannsee Conference\\" (with English subtitles). One cannot possible fathom the problems inherent in the today's Middle East and America without considering the implications of Dr. Rigg's work.declassified.

This book reads well, but is not referenced in a manner that will be useful to readers who prefer documentation (and yes, there are publishers who allow it!). For the general reader, who isn't interested in such distinctions, it may be a good read, but absent any analysis of Mueller, his career, or recent findings, the book fails to hit its intended mark.	2002-08-13

It is really a testimonial to Czech patriotism, but those who know (and you should) about the Wannsee conference in January 1942 (see the DVD Conspiracy or the German video The Wannsee Conference) will be interested also in Heydrich, who was rumored to be a Mischling (half-Jew).  The photos are rough, the tale is compelling.	2002-08-09

Another in the series by Mr. Douglas regarding former head of the Gestapo (Geheimstaatspolizei), Heinrich Mueller, nearly each page drops bombs that will make you think. If you prefer television to thinking, you can pass it by, but if you like a purportedly nonfiction page-turner, where it is the content, not the style, that really grabs you, this is a must. Shatters all preconceptions about the 20th century.	2002-08-09

This book, along with other books in the series, pose fascinating questions to the reader. However, I suggest they be read within some context--for example, the book \\"The Actor\\" by Alan Stang about John Foster Dulles. There is much about the origins of the century of World Wars, espionage and counter-espionage, assassinations, crimes against humanity of the grossest order, that is unknown. In another review, a Mr. David Hebden states that Mr. Douglas is really a Peter Stahl, a \\"notorious\\" forger of wartime documents (what has he to say about the recent book on the Kennedy assassination by Douglas?). The form of the writing leaves the reader to make his own conclusions--the actual writings of Douglas comprise possibly one-third of the book. However, prior to the Kennedy book, one might say that he has devoted a great deal of energy and expertise to a subject that no one really cared to know about, and yet the reading is nonetheless captivating simply because of the subject, and information, and the reproduction of original documents which must be taken on some faith by the reader. You can turn on some cable news channel, or you can start to think. And as we all know, thinking is dangerous.<br />Update:  10/14/2002.<br />Further research suggests to this writer that the documents relied upon by Mr. Douglas are not fakes or forgeries.	2002-08-09
