Brokaw, easily the most intelligent, fair and personable of the network news anchors, goes into what made him what he is today -- growing up in America's heartland, the struggles of his father and mother, his life growing up, and his temporary descent into idiothood -- before pulling back and marrying his college sweetheart. <br /> <br />An excellent and highly literate book! I heartily recommend it to anyone who likes biographies.	2004-10-09

It repeats quite a bit of the material given in Herb's earlier audio books, some of which are not in print. It also adds some additional information, and presents some of the original information in a different style. For the student of negotiation, this is an excellent resource to help explain how Herb Cohen, who is an adviser to U.S. Presidents and corporate America, manages to keep on top of his game.	2002-09-04

As always with McManus books, the book will leave you &quot;splitting a gut&quot; from all the laughter. <BR>Highly recommended.	2002-06-04

Irving	While the material presented in this audiobook is hilarious, the reader quality is sadly not up to the quality of previous McManus audiobooks. Unlike earlier books, it includes the entire text of the book itself. <br />The person who reads the book reads it with little of the feeling<BR>exhibited in the original Durkin-Hayes Audiobooks, featuring the amazing George S. Irving, which many McManus fans have<BR>become familiar. In my opinion, it is also not up to the general audio quality of the last book, into the Twilight, Endlessly Grousing, which was recorded by Terry Beaver. Still, the material is good, even if the recording is sub-Irving-standard.<br />Highly recommended for the outdoor fan, or for the general McManus fan, such as myself.	2002-06-04

His recent books have been either anthologies combining the material from other books, or in one case, a how-to book on humor writing development.    This book is more of the same amazing stories you've grown to know and love from the mind of Patrick McManus, most of which were originally featured in the pages of Outdoor Life magazine. It includes more stories originating in \\"Blight,\\" Idaho, of Rancid Crabtree, Crazy Eddie Muldoon, (and Mr. Muldoon) Mrs. Swisher, and a bear that hibernates in the attic.    Highly recommended for the outdoor fan, or for the general McManus fan, such as myself.	2002-05-23

Others will never read the book since they will be turned off by the title.<br />This book is a book about how to deal with life: rationally, reasonably, and dynamically. It's a book about dealing with life's challenges and problems, and most importantly, about how to find yourself in the business world. <br />All these years later, I still find myself referring to one of Ringer's theories, and applying them in the everyday business world. They are as true today as they ever were.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-04-02

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Excellent book	Many truly groundbreaking books will always solicit major arguments on one side or the other, since the books introduce a new way of thinking. Many people will be unhappy with the concepts, since they cause them to move away from their accepted view of the world.<br />Such is this book. Many of the reviews you might read ...will suggest this book is mere real estate quackery, but it is anything but that: it is a way for most of us to gain a basic understanding of the techniques that have been successfully used by the wealthy to accumulate wealth.<br />There will, of course, be those people who think that if you accumulate wealth that it's somehow evil...that only poor people are to be trusted. That, of course, is insanity. Look at all the immense good that has been done by the wealthy engaged in great causes. Any book such as this one that helps people get over the hump into looking at life as more than just \\"paycheck to paycheck\\" has to be considered useful. This one is a book that you want to sit down and read with a highlighter in your hand, to mark the material you wish to refer back to later.	2002-01-29

In it, marketing expert Jay Abraham helps you multiply your best efforts, through identifying and concentrating the skills you have to offer. It's rare that I find a program that has generated the amount of excitement that this program does, each time I listen to it.	2000-12-05

The cassette edition by this name is a compilation of only a few Pat stories. Dedicated McManus readers may already have the three volumes contained in this book.

I picked up this book at a local bookstore (sorry Amazon), mainly because it was the only VBA book they had. This book allowed me to learn a lot of  the concepts of VBA programming, in connection with Word 97 Annoyances, and  VB&amp;VBA Programming in a Nutshell. I recommend it to beginning VB  programmers, like I was. It helped me get above the basics, fast. It's easy  to discount these Dummies books, and most of them are so &quot;Dummy&quot;  that they aren't worth the effort, but this one is a good book.	2000-08-17

This book had the misfortune of being slurried into a bad Disney cartoon, and many people will no doubt judge it by the cartoon, and turn away. This  amazing book, easily read by most readers in just a few hours, teaches  readers the importance of sacrifice, the folly of seeking glory, and the  depth of human nature.

While this book doesn't convey a lot of the warmth that Harry Carey's personal  treatment does, it is perhaps the best attempt to sum up what made John  Ford one of Hollywood's greatest directors. It is clear the author has made  an intensive study of Ford's work, and even more clear that he admires it.  This book largely doesn't try to judge Ford, just to explain him. For that,  we owe Eyman a great degree of gratitude. Too many other authors have,  confronted with the genius of Ford's direction, tried to discount it  because of the cracks in his personal approach to life and actors, or  possibly because of personal jealousy. You must judge Ford the director on  his work, and his time, not on our opinions of what he could have done  better in his personal life, or according to our &quot;politically  correct&quot; views of what he should have done, and this book does an  excellent job on judging Ford by the standards of his time, and his life.  This is a masterful attempt at explaining Hollywood's master director.	2000-08-17

This book, centered around a bombadier's experiences in WWII, was written by a man who  served as a bombadier in WWII, Og Mandino. It is designed to help you to  learn from the experiences of people &quot;in high places&quot; who have  gone before...some of the greatest philosophers, self-help teachers, and  religious leaders.  It is written in an unassuming method that will demand  your attention, and can be read by almost anyone in just a few hours' time,  but will deliver information and ideas that will take you a lifetime to  fully realize how important they are.	2000-08-17

Although no book can change your life without a lot of work on your part, this book introduces you to a lot of empowering concepts, that, if used  consistently, can provoke mighty changes in your life. Robbins' methods are  totally unlike most of the self-help industry.

It seems trite to say it, but reading this book was one of the greatest spiritual experiences (so far at least! ) of my life. This is the book that launched  the career of Og Mandino, the author, and in the process, transformed the  lives of millions of his readers, who put the information and learning in  this slim volume into their daily lives. The book chronicles the experiences of a young man in the area of ancient Jerusalem, and his quest as he attempts to learn how to be a great salesman. In the process of his learning, he makes a decision that will influence his life forever. The book includes the wisdom of \\"ten scrolls\\" of learning, which the reader is instructed to follow. I have no doubt that if we have the courage to follow the wisdom in this book, it can alter our lives to an amazing amount.	2000-08-17

Based loosely on Welsh legends, Taran Wanderer is a book for  young minds and young hearts, no matter how old they may be  chronologically. Like many of us, Taran wanders through life, searching for  who he really is. Unlike many of us, in this book, he actually finds out.  If you are a wanderer, seize  this series of books.

For people just interested in McManus' writing, this might be somewhat of  the \\"magic behind the magician\\" variety...sometimes, you don't  want to know how the feat is accomplished. For writers, or anyone who wants  to know how Pat got into the business, and how he manages to keep at the top, this is an excellent book.

The author speculates on Ford's drinking, his sexuality, and his family problems.
