Halfway through this splendid book and a third of the way through this dreadful war, the reader confronts Germany as a wasteland: its crops ravaged or burnt or trampled, its peasantry slaughtered or starved or dead of disease.  One might well expect that the combatants, even if they had reached no closure, would fall back exhausted.  But no: there was worse to come-another 18 years of pillage and devastation until at last the participants, by now nearly bled dry, at last reconciled themselves, if not to an understanding, then at least to go home.  Oddly enough the Peace of Westphalia, which at last brought the conflict to a conclusion, came in time to serve as a template for the modern political world.<br /><br />This latter fact might be reason enough to read C. V. Wedgewood's classic account of the conflict.  But there is a happier reason, and that is that her exposition is, from start to finish, a delight.  In his introduction, Grafton calls her \\"the greatest narrative historian of [the 20th Century,\\" and it is hard to quarrel with him: she is brisk precise, compassionate, mordant and energetic<br /><br />Having said this, it is no contradiction to say that her story doesn't really gain traction until the coming of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, the man who, as it is said, secured the permanent establishment of Protestantism on the continent.  Gustavus is the only character to get a chapter of his own and from Wedgewood, the fullest personal description.  \\"Coarsely made and immensely strong, he was slow and rather clumsy in movement, but he could swing a spade or pick-axe with any sapper in his army.  ...\\"  Wedgewood goes on for several pages like this.  It is all good reading, and in the end, it is not quite hero-worship: no matter how much she may seem to admire Gustavus (and perhaps, to a much lesser extent, some of the other protagonists), still in the end the primary focus of her attention is on the German peasants-the poor pawns, battered and abused, in this miserable contention.  Nobody knows how much population Germany lost in the Thirty Years' War: some estimates say 40 percent.  Whatever the number, it is hard to imagine any feats of heroism or achievements of policy than justify all the bloodshed and is fortune.<br /><br />Grafton says Wedgewood writes like Gibbon.  In the end she writes like herself, but against Gibbon, a better comparison might be Tacitus: Ferdinand \\"was no a clever man but he had a certain unconscious ability for appropriating the ideas of clever men.\\"  John George of Saxony \\"had been known to sit at table gorging homely foods and swilling native beer for seven hours on end, his sole approach at conversation to box his dwarf's ears or to pour the dregs of a tankard over a servant's head as a signal for more. ... [H]e drank too much and too often. ... It made diplomacy difficult.\\"  Gustavus (again) \\"had, like many great leaders, an unlimited capacity for self-deception.  In his own eyes the Protestant champion, in Richelieu's eyes a convenient instrument against the House of Austria, he was in sober fact the protagonist of Swedish expansion on German soil.  Sweden stood to gain.  Protestantism stood to gain, but the German people stood to lose.\\"<br /><br />\\"Just imagine,\\" someone said, \\"if Gustavus had not taken a bullet at Lutzen in 1632, we might have a Lutherana Pope!\\"  Maybe.  Instead we are left with a heritage no less durable for being unintended: the system of nation-states, with individual sovereignty and at least the rudiments of  religious freedom-also, perhaps, the notion that nothing is worth fighting for quite this much, and that we are often better off just cultivating our garden.<br /><br />And yet a final irony is that Wedgewood published her first edition with the echoes of Hitler's rhetoric in her ears.  In an almost unexampled instance of contemporaneous comment, she remarks that \\"three centuries have smoothed every scar from [the] placid landscape, even as the philosophyof the new Germany [sc., in 1937] has submerged the spiritual landmark.  `Freedom of belief for all the world'-forgotten yearning of an age forgotten among men who have no choice but to believe what they are told.\\"the philosophy of the new Germany [sc., in 1937] has submerged the spiritual landmark.  `Freedom of belief for all the world'-forgotten yearning of an age forgotten among men who have no choice but to believe what they are told.\\"	2005-09-25

Besides, I doubt that any one commentator is likely to engage all, or even very much, of a mind so various.  But Levi's is a very good book with a particular virtue: it is a poet's response to a poet: recall Edmund Wilson (channeling Thoreau) on \\"the shock of recognition.\\"<br /><br />The poet in Levi makes him particularly helpful with a play like Loves's Labour's Lost-about the most explosive piece of versification Shakespeare ever hatched and of all his plays,  I would have thought perhaps the least accessible to a modern audience.  Levi makes his case that it is \\"a masterpiece\\" and concludes (this surprised me, but I am open to it)-concludes that \\"this play is particularly suitable even today to be played by intelligent amateurs...\\"  Except he adds: \\"...who are also on intimate terms,\\"-which adds a whole new layer of possibility.  I wonder what he would have thought of the Kenneth Branagh movie version.<br /><br />As a poet, Levi has one important quality that he shares with poets like Auden and Coleridge-a sensitivity to the broader culture, together with a fund of knowledge lightly worn.  Once in a while his penchant takes him almost to the brink of self parody, as in this priceless bit:<br /><br />\\"The refrain of the spring song, `Cuckoo, jug, jug, pu we, to witta woo!, is a more elaborate set of bird noises than any earlier example I recall in English.  I wonder whether someone has been reading Aristophanes' /Birds/ with their extraordinary noises: the `/tio tio tinx/' and so on.  Or was this a foreign musical tradition?  At any rate Shakespeare adopted it gleefully.  In French /turelure/ was a pagpiipe but /turlut/ was a skylark, and English larks in seventeenth-century poems sing `tirra lirra': `Tirry-tirry leerers upward fly.'  The most elaborate French example is by Du Bartas...\\"<br /><br />...all the more remarkable because not one of those bits is actual Shakespeare.  I think it may his poet's ear that also gives Levi a special feel for dramatic nuance.  Speaking of the inimitable \\"porter scene\\" from Macbeth, Levi makes the point that the low comedy has an unexpectedly chilly edge: \\"Shakespeare has simply darkened the scene where he seemed to lighten it, just as he did with Pompey and Abhorson in the prison in /Measure for Meausre,/ and with the gravedigging scene in /Hamlet/.  There are a thousand more such gems, not all convincing (I think he overrates /Two Gentlemen of Verona/ and underrates /Much Ado/, but let that be).<br /><br />From time to time, Levi enters into the game of speculation over the unanswerable questions: Shakespeare in the lost years of the 1580s, Shakespeare's patronage, Shakespeare's possible Catholicism.  Levi is not uninteresting here, but this is a game anyone can play and no can win-and in any event, newer \\"research\\" on many of these points has outstripped him.  Indeed in general I suspect it is fair to say that Levi is better as a critic than as a pure biographer.  No matter.

But McCarthy was, at the end of the day, a buffoon and a drunk.  Even his advocates will concede that he didn't have the staying power for the long haul.  By contrast, as Ybarra makes wonderfully clear, it was McCarran who had the energy, the persistence, the focus, to stay on issue and to get what he wanted-to congeal the forces of paranoia and xenophobia that go so far to make us what we are today..<br /><br />McCarran's toughness and endurance surely owe something to his sheepherder past.  His background influenced him other ways perhaps not so obvious.  One is that it equipped him to be a loner who really didn't care for anyone else's good opinion.  Better to be both loved and feared, said Machiavelli; but if you must choose one, choose fear.<br /><br />Another McCarran quality was the sense of permanent outsidership, the conviction that he was one of life's insulted and injured.  Finally, we have that favorite of the Freudians: an impassioned mother, convinced that her son might grow up to be a hero.<br /><br />Ybarra is not a graceful stylist.  But he is a dogged researcher which, in the end, is a virtue perhaps more to be valued than style.  Others have remarked that he goes on a bit long.  This second criticism seems a bit harsh: in the age of biographies as heavy as anvils, Ybarra is no more than a middleweight.  He does have a bit of a weakness for going of on tangents: he seems not to know how to tell a McCarran story without giving the entire history of the issue that led up to it.  Some may regard this as a disadvantage, but I must say, as one who obsesses over the history of the postwar period, I found every page a pleasure to read.  For specialized tastes, surely, but for the right audience, this one is hard to beat.	2005-09-21

This is an interesting and instructive little book, but it is hard to figure out just what its target audience might be-or even indeed, its precise topic.  Kermode calls it \\"the /Age/ of Shakespeare,\\" and the first chapter does, indeed, open, with some provocative insights about the world that surrounds Shakespeare and his plays.  Later on, he offers a useful introduction to the physical world of London theatre (or theatres).  But most of the book is more conventional in its organization: commentary on the plays, more or less one by one and more or less in chronological order.  The comments are unfailingly insightful and often original (or at any rate, new to me).  But they are fragmentary and so presented that they aren't likely to be of much help if you aren't reasonably familiar with the plays already.  Taken together, they are perhaps too modest for a specialist work and too concentrated for a beginner.  What it sounds like is a quick recap of a course in Kermode's Cambridge classroom, for students who know something, but not too much-but here (is this an occupational hazard for professors?) I wonder if he misgauges his audience.<br /><br />The particular commentaries are diverse, but I'd say that Kermode is particularly good on the poetry, closely defined: the language and the rhythm-a fitting achievement, I suppose, for a man who wrote the admirable \\"Shakespeare's Language.\\"  He has a happy knack for picking the illustrative example and, particularly, for the illustrative example that shows you how Shakespeare changes and grows over time.<br /><br />As a general intro to the playwright and his times, I would still favor Jonathan Bate's \\"The Genius of Shakespeare.\\"  But so long as you know what you are getting, Kermode is still good fun.  Here's a teaser:  of all the items new to me in this book, perhaps none is more memorable than the brief vignette of one Richard Topcliffe interrogator and torturer so far up in his profession that he was allowed to keep a rack in his own home.  Evidently we have Topcliffe's own copy of a history of the Jesuit mission to England with (as Kermode says) \\"his gloating marginalia: beside the name of a missionary the words `I racked him,' beside the name of someone hanged a little stick figure dangling from a gallows.\\"  The Age of Shakespeare was not an age for the faint of heart.me.

Aside, perhaps, for his friends and neighbors, we wouldn't remember him at all were it not as the author of \\"The Leopard,\\" not published until after his death, but in time to emerge as perhaps the best-known Italian novel of the 20th Century.<br /><br />Most people, whether or not they have ever heard of the novel, will recognize it (if at all) in the form of Burt Lancaster, swooping around the ballroom floor in Visconti's great movie.  It's wonderful fun but it is doubly misleading.  Lancaster persists in our mind as the picture of what we want an aristocrat to be: lean and strapping, dignified and austere.  A careful reading of the novel will remind us that this was never quite what di Lampedusa had in mind: his own fictional account of his princely great-grandfather is far more nuanced and ironic.<br /><br />Yet even in the novel, something of the hero remains.  Turn now to the first page of the photo insert after page 114: here we see the prince himself, Giulio Tomasi, Prince of Lampedusa.  And what an unsettling revalation emerges.  He is sturdy (fat?) and he projects an air of dignity.  Or tries to: but on anything more than a glance, we see that he is shy, tentative, and perhaps half bewildered at his own position.  And the muttonchop sideburns: perhaps they made sense in his time, but for the contemporary observer, they can't be anything more than absurd.<br /><br />Tactfully but inescapably, Gilmour in his text acknowledges the truth of the portrait.  Prince Giulo \\"had some of the despotic qualities of his fictional counterpart,\\" by Gilmour's account.  \\"Yet on the whole,\\" Gilmour continues \\"he appears a milder, weaker and more insignificant person...\\"  The Prince was \\"not interested in politics,\\" and his achievements in astronomy were \\"insubstantial.\\"<br /><br />The novelist's portrait, then, is not a likeness.  Better to describe it as the vision of an astonished child.  It is nonetheless gripping for that; yet one cannot help but wonder how much of the reality the reader of the novel (much less the moviegoer) really understands.  In a remarkable essay essay (which Gilmour substantially reprints here), di Lampedusa himself rails against what he calls the \\"infection\\" of Italian opera.  And not just in itself: rather, di Lampedusa argues, opera has inflicted great damage on Italian public life.  \\"Saturated and swollen-hearted by ... noisy foolishness,\\" says di Lampedusa (quoted by  Gilmour), \\"the Italians sincerely believed that they knew everything.\\"<br /><br />No one would say that \\"The Leopard\\" is \\"noisy foolishness.\\"  But reading Gilmour, we have to conclude that di Lampedusa's portrait of his ancestral homeland romanticizes history in its own way.  It is to Gilmour's great credit that he sets the record straight, not with sensationalism, but steadily and unblinkingly, as the homage history pays to art.t, then, is not a likeness.

One wonders if this (1956) is the last time when an English author writing in English would have treated this discreet reference to indiscretion as a foreign word.  Is it the concept that the English regarded as alien?  Or is it merely a pathetic effort to bury it under a veil of respectability?  Or a tacit acknowledgment that the French have more fun?<br /><br />Whatever the answer, the italics are a delicate way of identifying this entertaining novel as a creature of its times.  Indeed the action is dated (and the novel feels) a bit earlier-dating back the Atlee administration, when Britain was still reeling with exhaustion from World War II; when the socialists were busy trying to nationalize British industry, while the the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was busy trying to privatize Iranian oil.<br /><br />Wilson makes it pretty clear that he intends to write a period piece from the very beginning: there is a cast list, and it runs to nearly two pages.  For a novel of just 336 pages (in Penguin), this seems a bit much, and indeed quite a few of them are little more than sketches.<br /><br />No, more than a period piece: Wilson wants to write a panorama of his time.  This is an ambitious undertaking, and would be perilously easy for him to have fallen on his face.  He has not quite achieved all he strove for, but perhaps remarkably, he hasn't really fallen on his face either.  There isn't a lot of action, but there are some excellent character studies and a few good set pieces.  There is some good comedy, but perhaps not quite as much as the author intended.  Also of note: this must be about the first mainstream British novel to include explicitly gay characters (and not very nice ones, at that).<br /><br />For comedy, Wilson is not Evelyn Waugh; for compulsive readability, he isn't quite Graham Greene.  On the other hand, he isn't really striving to be either.  He's himself: entertaining and rewarding, with nothing  (much) for which to apologize.'s himself: entertaining and rewarding, with nothing  (much) for which to apologize.	2005-09-06

Or, from the standpoint of the reader, as an aged brandy, subtle and nuanced with a smooth aftertaste.  Robert O. Paxton has spent his career trying to make sense the dark hours in the middle of the 20rth Century.  He's enjoyed-and earned-the privilege of working with challenging colleagues, and with bright, informed students.  Now nearing the end of his career, he gets to deliver his informed judgment.<br /><br />Paxton does a commendable job of treading a fine line here.  One the one hand, he is alert to recognize that fascism doesn't lend itself to facile copybook definition: not every kind of evil is fascism, and not every evil state exhibits the same complex of pathologies.  But fascism does not escape definition altogether.  There is (argues Paxton) a set of characteristics that are noteworthy and distinctive.  Caution, plot spoiler ahead:<br /><br />\\"Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with trditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraint goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.\\"  (Paxton, 218)<br /><br />Paxton says that his own definition (if that is what it is) \\"encompasses its subject no better than a snapshot encompasses a person.\\"  Fair enough,  But Paxton's own insistence on this point is just one more reason to take pleasure in this remarkable summa from an important scholar.	2005-09-06

It's the kind of question I might address to the authors of Venice: The Tourist Maze, this entertaining and rewarding account of what may be the most touristed city in the history of the planet.<br /><br />You might suppose there is nothing new in a critique of Venetian tourism.  Venice first licensed tour guides in 1219 (and right there is a factoid I did not know until I read this book).  Any number of others have left accounts of tourism in Venice, and quite a few have left accounts of accounts.<br /><br />Davis and Marvin do a creditable job of trying not to replow old ground.  There's almost no mention of Mary McCarthy, Jan Morris, Viscount Norwich, and other visitors who have done so much to inform and entertain.  There's only a bit of Henry James; almost none of Proust and only a glancing reference to that most famous of all sex tourists, Thomas Mann's Gustav von Aschenbach.  Instead, they give their primary attention to tourism as an activity, from the standpoint alike of the provider and the consumer.  You might almost call it an account of \\"the enterprise of tourism,\\" except this makes it sound,  misleadingly, like yet one more business book.<br /><br />There is a whiff of the lamp about the presentation, although it never gets overpowering: the chapter on the gondola is called \\"the floating signifier,\\" which is, I guess, the kind of joke you are bound to get when academics try to have fun.  They say they \\"take advantage\\" of a notion of one \\"Appadurai\\" (who?), although he never makes it to the bibliography.  A more obvious progenitor is Dean MacCannell, whose \\"The Tourist\\" is one of those rare books to make fancy theory both interesting and plausible.  A still better source, though surely unintended, would be the trdition o;f the mystery novel, where the hard-boiled detective sees the great city from the underside (indeed I am a little surprised that they don't say a word about Donna Leon, the Arthur Conan Doyle of the Venetian murder mystery).<br /><br />But forget about the theory: some of their best stuff is the nuts-and-boats practical.

They provide an entertaining account, appropriately fascinated and appalled, of the  Venetian as the private obsession of Steve Adleson who has lavished on it (so they say) the sum of $1.5 billion.

He compiled a Tibetan-English dictionary, making himself virtually the first Western master of this vast and complicated civilization.<br /><br />Aside from its intrinsic merit, Csoma de Koros' inquiry into Tibetan culture made him a player in a remarkable historical enterprise: the recovery of Indian Buddhism.  Buddhism was born in India (or at any rate, on the India-Nepal border).  Yet it virtually vanished from its homeland and by the time the British arrived, its culture languished in obscurity and its monuments stood uncomprehended.<br /><br />Aside from Csoma de Koros, the recovery of the history of Indian Buddhism can be traced in large measure to the work of a handful of British imperialists, mostly young men somehow connected with the British East India Company, most of them exemplars of the tradition of amateur scholarship.  Perhaps the most famous is Sir William (\\"Oriental\\") Jones, who mastered Sanskrit and grasped the insight that the language of the Brahmins must somehow be related to Greek and Latin.<br /><br />Mostly they worked by a kind of triangulation, working from Tibet, Burman and Celyon (where Buddhism did survive) back to India, where it did not.  The enterprise crystallized about 1836, when scholars first saw that these diverse traditions derived from a common source.<br /><br />Allen's story is rich enough in character and incident to prove almost unmanageable at times-I found myself assembling my own character-list on the inside flyleaf.  But it is a marvellous yarn, well worth the effort.  Csoma de Koros, by the way never did find Atilla (apparently the Hungarians are not descendants of the Huns after all).

Shrewd and observant as he was, he seems not to have realized what the world could be like until he settled down here in what was then (as, indeed, now) one of the poorest parts of Italy.  It shocked him, as indeed it might have, for any number of reasons.  But Banfield focused on just one: \\"the inability of the villagers to act together for their common good or, indeed, for any end transcending the immediate, material interest of the nuclear family.\\"  Until then,  Banfield had been (he would surely hate this characterization) an American innocent-one thinks of the Ugly American in Graham Greene's novel, all good intentions and unintentional mischief.  The difference is, of course, that Banfield did not remain an innocent: with his unflinching clarity of vision, and his shrewd capacity for synthesis, he used this inquiry to launch himself into one of the most important careers in political science in the 20th Century.<br /><br />In hindsight, one may be tempted to say that he could have known better.  He does quote from \\"Christ Stopped at Eboli,\\" by Carlo Levi.  But in addition to Levi, others had seen what Banfield came to see: one thinks of Verga or Silone (one is tempted to add Sciascia, but most of his work came later).  Indeed, closer to home, he might have learnd from Norman Lewis' great \\"Naples '44.\\"<br /><br />But this, as I concede, is hindsight.  The fact is that you can't think of any other American scholar of his generation in his time who approached this kind of problem in this kind of way.<br /><br />Banfield's encounter with Montegrano clearly informs his later work: his studies of Richard Daley's Chicago and his later, more general work on city politics and on government in general.  Superficially, this may appear paradoxical.  In Montegrano, Banfield lamented the curse of \\"amoral familism.\\"  This might seem to suggest a distrust of families, and a hospitality to government participation (\\"It takes a village...\\").  Yet Daley's Chicago is a community of families and his later work shows a distrust of government that borders on truculence.<br /><br />The paradox is, of course, quite superficial.  Daley's Chicago is a community of families, but a community with a vibrant public life.  And it is the very corruption of government in a place like Montegrano that adds such plausibility to Banfield's later critique.  One thinks of James C. Scott and his admirable \\"Seeing Like a State\\".<br /><br />There is another and wholly different virtue of Banfield's work that deserves mention.  This is his use of scholarly apparatus.  The blurb on my old Basic Books copy says mentions (appreciatively) his \\"use of T.A.T. materials\\" along with \\"intensive standardized fieldwork Neo-Freudian psychology, and structural-functional analysis.\\"  Even the concept of \\"amoral familism\\" bears the smell of the lamp. It is all bound to send the alert reader fleeing to the new Harry Potter.  A critical mistake: Banfield not only survives all the academic detritus, he positively transcends it: he is one of the few who can make this kind of analytical structure produce something plausible and interesting.<br /><br />Footnote: for further background on Banfield, there is a wonderful appreciation by his sometimes co-author, James Q. Wilson, in The Public Interest for Winter 2003.

Granted that it is not young: my copy bears a puublication date of 1975, which is positively Jurassic in terms of current academic writing (there is a later edition).  But that is, perhaps, the point it is Davis (in company with his sometimes Yale colleague, Vann Woodward) who taught us what we know about slavery-and if we know more than they did, it is because of what they taught us.  Davis is what our professors read when they went to school-perhaps even more, our professors' professors.  The giveaway is in the Amazon listing of books that cite this book.  At this writing, there are 145: skim the list and you see a virtually comprehensive library of modern academic writing on the subject.<br /><br />Davis is not always a delight to read.  His style is discursive, somewht elliptical, after the manner of a beloved senior professor in his seminar room (his discussion of Somerset's Case is maddening in its indirection).  He can seem to sprawl: indeed it is precisely this tendency to sprawl which leads me to prefer \\"Age of Revolution\\" to its companion piece, \\"The Problem of Slalvery in Western Culture.\\"  But the difficulty of pinning him down means also that he doesn't lend himself to soundbytes or oversimplifications.<br /><br />There are other indispensable names in the literature of slavery: Fogel and Engerman, surely, and Eugene Genovese (and, I suppose, Faulkner's `Absalom, Absalom!\\").  But any shelf on the topic without Davis has a very gaping hole, indeed.	2005-08-11

He wasbclearly a man with (again in his own words) \\"the capacity to feel with a singular intensity ... not only their own identities but those of other people....\\"  And although he may feel that his capacity is somehow unusual, he does a remarkable job of imagining (or is it projection?) that capacity in others.  Everybody, he says somewhere (although I can't put my finger on it), has a story that deserves to be told.<br /><br />In his introduction, David Richards calls Bunin \\"egocentric.\\"  In context I think I know what it means, but it's an odd choice of words and I suspect misleading.  Conceded that Bunin is not a \\"social\\" novelist in the sense that Tolstoi is, nor a dramatist like Dostoevsky: his metier is, indeed, the minute attention to feelings.  In some sense I suppose these feelings are \\"his own,\\" but in some sense, every artist's feelings are \\"his own.\\"  Perhaps closer to the mark to suggest that at some level every one of us is an egocentric, and that Bunin may be able to capture the egocentricity in all of us.<br /><br />Caution: Bunin won a Nobel Prize, but don't be misled into disappointment.  He's a fine and rewarding writer, but not better than several others who did not win the prize, the award of which inevitably has more to do with politics than with intrinsic merit.	2005-08-10

I must have bought it that time.  Anyway I've had it long enough so that the first 24 pages (also the last few) have long since fallen off, worn away by repeated and stuffing and unstuffing into (out of) a travel pack.  It has always been, and remains, indispensable: the Swiss Army Knife of Italian dictionaries.  Or better, perhaps, like the TI BA-II calculator: same old boring format and framework, same dependable performance.  Indeed, I bought another pocket Italian dictionary a couple of years back (why?).  It's probably perfectly fine, but somehow I keep coming back to this packworn original, while the new one reposes silently on the shelf.<br /><br />I would like to, but cannot honestly, say that I am fluent in Italian: most of the time, when I try to speak it in a shop, they just answer in English and save everyone the trouble.  But I can dope my way through the newspapers and a simple novel or two.  And for this--here's a five-star salute to my companion of 20-plus years.	2005-08-10

It makes me feel as if I'm almost the only one to come down in the middle.  Or perhaps not: maybe better to say that I'm of two (or more) minds at once-I like it, but with some large reservations.  Trying not to repeat anything that has said before, let me offer a couple of thoughts.<br /><br />One: the book is showing its age.  This can hardly be a criticism: any thing that lives in the world is going to show its age sooner or later.  But it may be worthy of remark in the case of this book because it tells us (perhaps surprisingly) about the progress of modern feminism.  There's an edginess here and an insecurity that rings true enough on its own terms-but it harkens back to another time.  Not to say there aren't plenty items still pending on the feminist agenda, but we (or at least the chattering classes, where Norman Rush would find his home) seem to approach them with a bit more deliberation than might have been the case a few years back.  Understand, this is not necessarily a complaint.  Indeed, one of the unexpected side benefits of reading this book was to recall how these issues were fought out 20-odd years ago.<br /><br />But this perhaps leads naturally to the other point, which is the real source of my ambivalence.  I mean the matter of narrative voice: Rush is a man writing as a woman.  Can a man ever write as a woman?  It might be a good essay question for a literature exam-good, in the sense of unanswerable, if endlessly beguiling.  I guess we say that Henry James did it-but then, as a man, how will I ever know?  I do feel that George Eliot, at least, is a woman who can write as a man (and here, I suppose, I am entitled to voice an opinion).  But I'd have to concede that not many others do as well.  I wonder if Rush  belongs in so select a company.  I wonder, and I did wonder all the way through these several hundred pages which I read with (mostly) interest and (I hope) profit.	2005-08-10

List longa, vita brevis.  And besides, I have at hand Konstantin Mochulsky's splendid \\"Dostoevsky: His Life and Work.\\"  Strictly speaking, I can't compare it to Frank which, as I say, I haven't read (although I've peeked).  The point is just that Mochulsky is so comprehensive and so insightful that I feel no special need to push further.<br /><br />Frank runs to five volumes.  At 678 pages, Mochulsky is not exactly svelt.  Still he succeeds in capturing at least two books in one.  It is first a pretty good, straightforward, narrative of  D's life, which is certainly a tale to tell on its own.  Indeed it is hard to think of any artist except perphaps Caravaggio whose life can bear telling on its own.<br /><br />But perhaps more imimportant, it is a marvellously shrewd appreciation of all the major (and some of the minor) works.  I picked up a copy some years ago in a second-hand shop, when I hadn't read much of D.  Since then, every time I've knocked off another monument, I've gone to D to tell me what I've read.  He's been unfailingly helpful, always adding something to the mix (perhaps particularly with The Idiot which, I might as well admit, at first reading I simply did not get).  I'm sure Frank has even more to offer but as I say, you have to set priorities.  I have Mochulsky.  And besides, there is a bit more of D to read...	2005-08-05

At the most forgiving, we can call it a nonce work, interesting as an exemplar of the kind of bitchiness and personalism that passes for journalism in Italy.  But for the ordinary reader today, if it is to succeed at all, it needs a comprehensive introduction.  But Peter Robb (who has written well about Sicily elsewhere) apparently wasn't willing to put in the time or the effort.<br /><br />Some will say that the likely reader already knows about the Moro episode.  Probably in outline, yes, but if he knows it in the kind of detail necessary to appreciate this work, he has probably read Sciascia's account long ago--and, chances are, in Italian.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you really do want a decent overview of the Moro affair, there is a good one available, ironically, through the New York Review of Books.  It's a review, by Adrian Lyttelton available (albeit as paid content) in the archives at the NYRB website.  If you really need to master Sciascia on Morrow, Lyttelton is probably a ticket.  But unless you are a fairly serious specialist, you can probably give it a bye.	2005-08-04

There is none of the usual stuff that can make a biographer's life so easy: gossipy letters, shrewd observations from friends or enemies.  Moreover Tiepolo seems to have been, by any conventional measure, a pretty boring guy.  By all the evidence, he had little or no contact with the cultural icons of Venice in his time-Goldoni say, or Metastasio, or Vivaldi (one notable exception:  the artist Giambattista Piazzetta-Levey says that Piazzetta and Tiepolo were \\"the Picasso and Matisse, or perhaps better the Turner and Constable of their period).  For an artist whom we identify as a child of the Age of Absolutism, it perhaps comes as a surprise to recognize that he worked only once in a \\"major\\" court-at the very end of his life, Madrid.  Rather, he seems to have been something of a workaholic: it has been said that he covered more square feet of wall space than any other artist in history.  Perhaps the most interesting thing about him is to observe how much of his life he spent on a scaffold, 20 or 50 feet off the ground.<br /><br />Michael Levey has done a creditable job of walking us through the Tiepolo gallery.  He offers shrewd and appreciative insights on any number of works, making us understand Tiepolo with new eyes.  Has the reader noticed, for example, how many of Tiepolo's really important figures are women?  Or, perhaps even more remarkable, how many of the \\"really important figures\\" in the pictures are not that \\"iimportant\\" after all?  Or how, for all his pomp, his pictures remain gentle, playful, almost light-hearted?<br /><br />Levey's book is thus an honorable effort, but Tiepolo deserves  more.  Attractive as he is on his own terms, he cries out to be put into a larger context.  For surely, whatever his intrinsic merits, a large part of the appeal of Tiepolo today is his utter foreignnesss: the sense he conveys of exemplifying a world so different from our own.  The Greeks and the Romans and the Bible themselves seem scarcely more remote than Tiepolo's representation of them-sometimes less so, since the originals are more part of our cultural equipment.  It is good to have an appreciative understanding of Tiepolo's art.  It would be even better to see him evaluated as a figure of his times.mans and the Bible themselves seem scarcely more remote than Tiepolo's representation of them-sometimes less so, since the originals are more part of our cultural equipment.

Berberova isn't a terribly good writer--discursive, disorganized, fatally susceptible to digression from almost any direction.  Morever she doesn't seem particularly to like her subject--a failing perhaps more common among biographers than you might at first guess.<br /><br />So, as biography, not a delight.  But as conversation--my, this is wonderful.  Stick with it a few pages and let yourself hear the voice: you get the sense that you are in her kitchen, beside the samover, while she rattles on conjuring up ghosts, settling old scores, and generally jabbing the ribs of a whole generation of Russian emigres and their friends.<br /><br />The \\"Index of Names\\" at the end gives you some hint of what you are up against: some 60 pages, perhaps 600 names of all the people who wandered in and out of Moura's life, or cast a shadow over it.  Who /did/ this index, anyway?  It is a quirky marvel, not quite comprehensive but close enough that you want to keep it around for consultation in reading any number of other emigre works.<br /><br />Oddly--okay, not so oddly--the dominant figures in this tumultuous cast are not the author herself but two of the men in her life: Maxim Gorky and H. G. Wells.  And what a pair of gasbags they turn out to be: writers of moderate talent and immoderate self-enchantment, too blinded by the mirror to understand anything about the dreadful world they lived in.  Wells once tried to lecture Stalin on the state of the world; Stalin wasn't interested.  Gorki actually moved back from exile into Russia, convinced he could make a difference; he died (or was murdered) somewhat the wiser.<br /><br />The Russians do seem to have a knack for memoir: think Herzen, think Nadezhda Mandelstam, think Trotsky's autobiography.  In fairness, Berberova's memoir of Moura isn't a patch on any of these three, not in insight or imagination or literary skill.  But it's its own self, and judged on its own terms, it makes a compulsive read.it makes a compulsive read.	2005-08-04

Prichard Jr.	Books	4	11	11	N	N	The Man Who Might Have Been Ed Prichard	Who would of thought that here in the third millennium we would still take time to read about Ed Prichard, whose life story will be linked through eternity with a third rate felony-and a blundering, ham-handed felony at that?  Prichard is dead more than 20 years now, as are almost all those who loved and hated him.  He never held public office-indeed, more generally, never came close to fulfilling the promise of his admirers.  Why would anyone care?<br /><br />To this question, it is possible to give an uncharitable reply.  Kentucky, one might say, is a place with more past than future.  To dwell on a footnote may be read as saying: we almost amounted to something, we could have been a contender.<br /><br />And yet, and yet.  And yet we have the testimony of the best and the brightest that Prich himself was the best and the brightest; if not as an actor, perhaps as a thinker and certainly as a talker..  Indeed, I had the privilege to observe Prich in what might be called his rehabilitation phase: the early 60s when his friends were trying to ease him back from obloquy and exile onto the political stage.  I will add my testimony to those of legions who swore that Prichard in full spate was simply the greatest three-ring oratorical circus of which a simple country boy might dream, his whooshes of insight keeping easy company with his flashes of savage wit.  No wonder he won the affection of Felix Frankfurter, of Phil Graham, of-good heavens, is this true?-of Sir Isaiah Berlin.<br /><br />Indeed: Berlin was once his roommate and like so many was stunned and horrified when Prich was convicted by a Kentucky jury  The details are there Tracy Campbell's account, along with a great deal else one may have remembered or forgotten about the politics of Kentucky in the last Century.  Campbell tells it all earnestly and unflinchingly, and a strangely compelling story it remains.<br /><br />Is there a larger context for Prich's story?  Probably not a great one, but by a stretch, you could fit it into more general story of the history of the New Deal.  It was here, after all, that Prich occupied center stage: as the brilliant young scamp who enchanted Felix Frankfurter, and who put himself at the elbow of Robert Jackson, of Fred Vinson, of Jimmie Byrnes (although both Jackson and Byrnes stayed aloof, and even Vinson saw Prich's limits).  One can, at least with caution, take Prich as a kind of symbol for what was right and wrong with those years: the brilliance, the optimism, the energy, together with an overlarge dose of self-admiration, bordering on downright narcissism.  Prich was, after all, as dazzling as they say he was.  But he was an appalling abuser of friendship, a serial shirker of duties, and at best no more than a mediocre husband and father.  Even after he started taking fees from the strip miners, he never really paid his taxes.  Indeed, one of the remarkable parts of the Prich story is the way so many people were taken in by him-not merely by his skills at rhetoric and dialectic (which were indisputable) but by the notion that these virtues somehow translated into political gravitas.<br /><br />Campbell does a conscientious job of surveying the evidence surrounding Prichard's pivotal bout with ballot-stuffing in 1948.  Laudably, he hesitates to draw any grand conclusions.  I will indulge myself a bit more.  Prich came back to Kentucky touted as the next governor, senator, president-offices to which (says Campbell), absent his \\"lapse\\" he \\"would certainly\\" have risen.  But by Campell's own testimony, this is nonsense.  Campbell himself says that Prich \\"had not the ambition or the personality for such posts.\\"  Quite right: probably nobody knew this better than Prich himself.  His friends saw him as the next Roosevelt; he knew he was closer to Peter Pan.  By sticking his hand in a ballot box, he relieved himself of all these impositions: he may have left his friends bewildered and disappointed, but he gave himself the freedom to remain forever young.lf the freedom to remain forever young.	2005-07-28

Now, that's a travesty.  If you have to read just one book about Watergate this book has no competitor.  If you have to read just one book to show what good journalism can be, ditto.  We say that journalism at best is &quot;a rough draft&quot; and we need to await &quot;the verdict of history.&quot;  But Lukas put this together in a matter of months and after 30-odd years, it still stands unchallenged on the shelf.<br />The fulcrum of this book is, of course, the &quot;third-rate burglary&quot;  from which Watergate takes its name.  But Lukas is far-sighted enough not to begin with that.  He gives us the larger context of the early Nixon years: the internal wiretapping, the fund-raising money machine, the systematic campaign of dirty tricks against the 1972 Democratic campaign, both primary and general.<br />Indeed, for me perhaps the true pivot point is not the burglary at all, but rather that moment in January, 1972, when Gordon Liddy launched &quot;a well-prepared thirty-minute 'show-and-tell'&quot; to introduced &quot;Project Gemstone&quot; -- intended as &quot;a vast intelligence-gathering and dirty-tricks campaign&quot; against the Democrats and (one would have to say) against the electoral process itself.  Here it all is: electronic surveillance and wiretapping; breakins; kidnap squads; mugging squads; call girls; sabotage. John Dean says he found it &quot;mind-boggling.&quot; But Attorney General John Mitchell was more restrained: &quot;That's not quite what we had in mind,&quot; he said. And Jeb Magruder was more proactive: &quot;Cheer up, Gordon,&quot; he said, &quot;You just tone the plan down a little and we'll try again.&quot;<br />For my money, that is the point at which any decent public servant would have stood up and shouted &quot;GET THIS GUY OUT OF HERE!  Don't let him come within a dung-fork's distance of any public policy issue any time, anywhere, ever again.&quot;  Of course we know better now: in fact, Liddy's campaign did go forward largely as he had planned it.  And it was not a free-lance operation: rather, it was embedded at the very heart of the Nixon administration.<br />From the introduction of Gemstone we move on moment by moment through the burglary, the coverup, the coverup of the coverup and finally, Nixon's resignation.  By that point, almost any reader will concede that Lukas has documented his case. The denoument is the celebrated &quot;smoking gun&quot; -- the text of the tape of Nixon's conversation on June 23, 1972.<br />&quot;What made the tape so damaging,&quot; says Lukas, &quot;was ... the plain, irrefutable language which showed that six days after the Watergate burglary the President of the United States knew a great deal about the break-in, realized that Liddy and [E. Howard] Hunt had been involved, recognized Mitchell's probable complicity, personally ordered a cover-up of the facts, and used the CIA and the FBI to protect his personal political interests.&quot;<br />Watergate was a tragedy, of course, and any honest account is bound to make pretty sordid reading.  But at the end, one can find uplift.  For however many people behaved badly, quite a lot of people behaved well: famously Eliot Richardson, who resigned as Attorney General rather than fire Archibald Cox; perhaps more subtly Congressman Peter W. Rodino, Jr., who succeeded (at no small efort) in keeping the House hearings decent and honorable; more surprisingly Congressman Lawrence Hogan, conservative Republican from Maryland who upstaged some of his more liberal colleagues by declaring for impeachment (he was offended at what Nixon had done to the FBI).  And I'd even save a kind word for Hugh W. Sloan, Jr., a campaign staffer who did, concededly, take part in some of the money-sloshing, but who in the end refused to go along with the coverup.<br />Woodward and Bernsteinhave their place in Watergate history, if not nearly as great as their own (well--Woodward's) self-promotion would suggest.  If they did not originate much in the way of real Watergate news, they did a great deal to keep the topic on the agenda.

One day without warning (during a conference in China), Mao suggested that he and K continue their consultation in the swimming pool.  Mao, who was a powerful swimmer, plunged in from the deep end and continued lecturing K between strokes.  K who could barely swim paddled around the shallow end until someone threw him a float (a rubber ducky?).  K floated around in the ducky for a while as Mao continued to lecture.  Finally K got out and sat on the edge of the pool, so at least Mao had to look up while he was talking.<br />During Richard Nixon's memorable 1959 visit, K took Nixon for a boat ride on the Moskva River.  He stopped to visit picnickers and would say: yo, comrade!  Are you imprisoned?  Are you enslaved? (I was on the Moskva River last summer - the picnickers are still there)  K made the trip in an embroidered Ukrainian folk shirt.  Nixon, true to form, wore his blue business suit.<br />At the Ambassador Hotel in LA in 1960, K fell into an improvised harangue, expressing his resentment at not being permitted to go to Disneyland.  Sitting at the table with K's wife, Nina Petrovna, Frank Sinatra leaned over to David Niven and said - screw the cops, tell the old lady we'll take him ourselves.<br />And best of all (I can't put my finger on it; I quote from memory)--<br />At a public appearance In London in (1956?) someone booed K.  He had never heard a boo before.  He asked his handler - what is this \\"ooh ooh\\" sound?  The handler explained.  K was fascinated. For the rest of the day, he went around muttering \\"Boo!  Boo!\\"<br />These anecdotes only begin to suggest the richness of this wonderful biography, which accomplishes he formidable achievement of making K seem at once sympathetic and appalling.  Sympathetic in that he was in so many ways a recognizable human being: energetic, warm-hearted, devoted to his (immediate?) family.  He was also (and this is no small point) a true believer.  We tend to think of the last generation of Soviet leaders as self-serving bureaucratic infighters who held onto power because they held onto power. But Taubman leaves you in no doubt that K thought he was building a better world.<br />Sympathetic, yes, but appalling: K was at the end of the day an unsophisticated peasant, crass and violent and almost fatally out of his depth as a political leader.  Time and again he launched into schemes that he hadn't thought through - or hadn't the capacity to think through - inflicting untold suffering on innocent bystanders and at least once (the Cuban Missile Crisis) bringing us all to the edge of disaster (on this last, Allison &amp; Zelikow, Essence of Decision, is a great companion piece).  Taubman's account is longish, and from time to time he seems to dawdle over stories that may not be central to his plot.  He has a big story to tell, and his can hardly be the last word.  But as a convincing portrait, setting the personal in the midst of the political, Taubman's biography of K can hardly be bettered.izable human being: energetic, warm-hearted, devoted to his (immediate?) family.

We have a central story - one of the great non-events in human history, the moment when the Soviet Union and the United States \\"came eyeball to eyeball\\" (as Dean Rusk is said to have said) before someone blinked.  We hear it three times: one, from the standpoint of the \\"rational actor;\\" second from the internal logic of organizations; and third, from the perspective of politics where people more or less rub along together.<br />It's an event that bears retelling and, with qualification, the device works.  The upshot is that we get some insight into the missile crisis.  But not at all incidentally, we get some insight into the academic study of politics (I resist calling it \\"political science\\"), and a whiff of what it might have to offer for our better understanding of the world.<br />Aside from the Kurusowa effect, there is another structural innovation.  We have, in a sense, two books interleaved, like Faulkner's \\"Wild Palms.\\"  The even-numbered chapters tell (and retell) the basic story.  The odd-numbered chapters offer a framework of \\"theory.\\"<br />I suppose you might read just the even-numbered chapters - indeed the authors themselves suggest as much, though rather half-heartedly.  And indeed, the odd-numbered chapters can be heavy going.  One cannot help recalling the old canard about the sociologist as a person who gets a government research grant to find the bordello next door.  You are tempted to say that their theory is what sophisticated people know anyway, and the clueless will probably never figure out.<br />But there is an answer to this dismissal.  That is:  most (or at least) a lot of history gets told from the standpoint of the \\"rational actor.\\"  A survey of the competing approaches makes it clear just what this approach leaves out.  And if the polyphonic approach is so obviously superior to the single narrative line, then why have historians from Thucydides to Henry Kissinger been willing to do without it?  One answer might be: for all their talents, they simply haven't learned the way to tell a story in any other way.<br />So on the whole, retelling works.  But not, perhaps, as well as it might.  Another reviewer has said that this isn't really a case to illustrate \\"organization\\" theory here because this is not a case that highlights organizations - rather, at least for the United States, the response to the Cuban missile crisis was the work of a small group of men, working together in close cooperation.  There is some merit to this view: concededly, you do not get the clash of bull elephants that you might have got at another time when Defense makes war on State, and both work together to fend of Intelligence.  But you get a taste of it: we find that the Joint Chiefs were most hospitable to an invasion; that State thought that maybe we could talk it through; and that John McCone from the CIA was the one person who most clearly anticipated the threat.  Moreover, you see the \\"organization\\" problem in a somewhat different light, when you see how the President's orders were massaged or modified by the military (sometimes, even, within the military).<br />But perhaps in any event, I need not get too distracted by the framework.  Along the way, there are any number of nuggets that stand pretty well on their own.  I liked in particular, for instance, the discussion of the role of committee work.  We tend to stick up our nose at any project done by committee.  But, argue our authors, in World War II it was Churchill, high-handed as he was, who worked through committee-and virtually always followed the committee's advice.  The \\"strong leader\\" who kept things close to his vest, was Hitler.<br /> But more generally - I was already an adult at the time of the Cuban missile crisis, and I remember it well.  Specifically, I remember how frightened were so many people in my surroundings.  I wasn't that frightened; I figured that one way or another, we would rub along.  In the end, of course, I was right - we did rub along.  But I think in retrospect, it was I who was kidding myself and the Nervous Nellies who had the right attitude.  We did rub along, but as Wellington said about the Battle of Waterloo, it was a near thing.  I particularly like Robert Kennedy:<br />\\"The fourteen people [in the American inner circle] were very significant-bright, able, dedicated people, all of whom had the greatest affection for the U.S. ... If six of them had been President of the U.S., I think that the world might have been blown up.\\"<br />[Final technical note: one or more of the other reviews appear to be discussing the first edition of this book.

In any event, I think this work has perhaps better claim than any other for discrediting Marxism as an intellectual movement, recharacterizing it as a theology or (perhaps better) a theodicy.  The whole set is superb, but seen in this light, perhaps the most important part is the first chapter on &quot;the origins of dialectic.&quot;  &quot;Marx's thought,&quot; K explains, &quot;would be emptied of its content if it were not considered in the setting of European cultural history as a whole, as an answer to certain fundamental questions that philosophers have posed for centuries in one form or another.&quot;  K thus identifies &quot;philosophic interest&quot; as centering &quot;on the limitations and misery of the human condition--not its obvious, tangible and remediable forms, but the fundametnal impoverishment which cannot be cured by technical devices and which, when once apprehended, was felt to be the cause of man's more obvius, empirical deficiencies, the latter being mere secondary phenomena.&quot;  Taking this premise and starting with Plotinus, it takes K just 60-odd pages of leaps and swoops to reach Hegel and his dialectic -- &quot;an account,&quot; as K calls the dialectic, &quot;of the historical process whereby consciousness overcomes its own contingency and finitude by constant self-differentiation.&quot;  K is this positioned to move forward through the Hegelian left and on to the young Marx. Having situated Marx in this grand tradition of philosophical thought, then (and only then), K is ready to situate him in the narrower arena of European socialism.<br />K's second volume is a closer and more specific reading of Marxism in &quot;The Golden Age,&quot; which takes him (inter alia) through a great variety of names now mostly forgotten except among specialists (the Poles in particular are likely to be unfamiliar to readers in the United States).  This section volume is admirable on its own terms, although perhaps less distinctive or memorable than the first.<br />The final volume, on &quot;The Breakdown&quot; is the one closest to the author's own time and thus the one perhaps most in need of revision.  Names like Gramsci and Lukacs certainly belong in the permanent record, though almost anything K had to say about them is bound to need nuance from later research and analysis.  Names like Korsch and Goldmann begin to take on some of the flavor of quaint antiquity.<br />But that kind of difficulty can hardly be avoided and certainly does nothing to impugne the greater merits of the set as a whole.  This is a work for the ages, and in a better world, it would remain in print where it deserves to be.to readers in the United States).

Others will find it a bit over the top.  It's a matter of taste, but if you like this sort of thing, then you will get your fill of it in this biography.<br />Holmes makes his choices as to detail, of course.  He has less choice with the character of his subject. Coleridge seems to have made at least three capital contributions to the history of English literature.  First, he crafted a number of weirdly unforgettable lyrics, notably \\"The Ancient Mariner,\\" and \\"Christobel\\" and \\"Kubla Khan.\\"  Second, he introduced German idealistic philosophy (Kant, and particularly Schelling) to an untutored island race.  And third, he produced a body of criticism, shrewd and insightful in itself, but also the first (in England, at least) ever based on an explicit intellectual framework.  Maybe a fourth: he is the architect of a conservative critique of modernity that probably continues to deserve a place in the conservative intellectual tradition.<br />But, but, but, but - what a dreadful human being!  Not dreadful in the sense of mean, spiteful, combatitive.  No: dreadful in the sense of lachrymose, self-pitying and an epic-proportions sponge.  It is that last that takes one's breath away. Blanche DuBois had the good grace to depend on the kindness of strangers. Coleridge cheerfully victimizes his nearest and dearest, and even makes friends out of those he is newly victimizing.<br />The amazing part is, of course, that they put up with it - his wife Sara (who refused to divorce him even when he asked her to); his poetical companion, William Wordsworth, and any of half a dozen less easily identified but no less important benefactors.  Over and over, they report that they were dazzled by his presence, not least in his conversation. Indeed on the testimony of these friends, he must have been one of the world's all-time great conversationalists.  And here Holmes has another problem not of his own making: conversation is the most ephemeral of arts (even more so than cooking).  And while we have any number of testimonials to his conversational ability, we have little or no direct evidence of what he actually said.<br />Having archly complained about the excess of detail in this book, I suppose it may seem inconsistent of me to ask for more.  Yet I will do so: Coleridge lived in turbulent times and he becomes involved, at least as a \\"commenting intellectual,\\" in that turbulence.  Holmes adverts to the social and political background.  It might have helped had he applied his considerable powers of description and analysis to sketching out more thoroughly the political landscape in which he lived.<br />Samuel Johnson said of Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" that none have ever wished it longer.

It's an odd remark--what did he mean, &quot;seen&quot;?  Suffered in?  Or watched newsreel footage on the History Channel? One cannot escape the conviction that Malraux is trying to hype the aroma of glamour around his own life.<br />But this is a distraction.  The question is: I wonder what he thinks of the extraordinary array of &quot;witness literature&quot; from Europe beginning, perhaps, with Dostoevsky's &quot;House of the Dead&quot; and ending (one may hope?) with Solzhenitsyn's &quot;Gulag Archipelago.&quot;<br />In this chorus, Aleksander Wat's &quot;My Century&quot; stands as a luminous example.  Wat was a Pole: Jewish by background but at last a convert to Christianity.  He was a poet and a &quot;literary person&quot; before and after World War II.  Along the way, he spent time in 13 (or was it 14?) different prisons, all simply for being who he was.&quot;<br />His &quot;memoir&quot; is not precisely something he &quot;wrote.&quot;  Wat spent the year 1964-5 in Berkeley. There he fell in with Czeslaw Milosz, a great poet in his own right.  Largely with the encouragement of Milosz, he &quot;dictated&quot; his story in a series of interviews which have been somewhat recast for this book.  It's just as harrowing as you would expect it to be it has its uplifting side, driven by Wat's amazing inner resouurces: one thing about a good education, it gives you stuff to think about in Prison.  And even at the worst, his sense of humor does not fail him. He recounts the story of the citizens of Bukhara, who surrendered to Ghengis Khan--only to have Ghengis Khan order their massacre. As Ghengis Khan explained to the elders:<br />&quot;You must have sinned greatly against God if he sent Ghengis Khan down on you!&quot;<br />Aside from Wat's own story, the NYRB edition includes an astonishing narrative by his wife, recounting a particularly dreadful chapter in her own prison years.<br />There is a promising-looking biography by Tomas Venclova, but I haven't read it.  Wat died in 1967, I believe (though I can't seem to pin this down) a suicide.dition includes an astonishing narrative by his wife, recounting a particularly dreadful chapter in her own prison years.<br />There is a promising-looking biography by Tomas Venclova, but I haven't read it.

It is not a general history of brutality and mass murder in the 20th Century. Heaven knows there is  too much of that for any one book: and Power leaves out any number of primary contenders - Stalin, Mao, Idi Amin, not to say Pinochet and the Central American Death Squads.  She does discuss half a dozen or so major mass crimes, but even here, she makes no pretense of offering a comprehensive narrative.  Rather, she chooses her episodes to show either (first) the development of the concept of genocide or (second) the response of the West, and in particular the United States, to the challenge some particular episodes presented.  For no extra charge, she throws in an extraordinary brief biography of the strange, difficult, obsessive Raphael Lemkin-the man who can be characterized, without any real exaggeration, as having invented the concept of genocide, even to the point of fashioning its name.<br />The episodes that do get her attention are: Cambodia, Rwanda, Iraq, and Yugoslavia - that last, three times.  The reviewer can scarcely summarize the array of misconduct that she puts on review: suffice it to say you won't be humming the tunes of this one on the way out of the theatre.  The misconduct of the direct actors - murder, mayhem, rape and more - is quite enough in itself.  The extra dose is the persistent inaction or half-hearted action of those who might have responded.<br />A good deal of this will be familiar to anyone who has carefully followed the news over the last generation-although heaven knows, one can be excused for trying to forget.  A couple of particular items struck me as new.  Example: power argues that \\"poison gas\\" may not have been the worst of Saddam's crimes against the Kurds (in 1988) - but that it was the one that provoked the most indignation because it harkened back to World War I and thus engaged the imagination of the West.  In the same vein, concentration camps may not have been the worst of the evils in Bosnia - but it provoked the most indignation because it harkened back to World War II.<br />A perhaps more meaningful point: Power makes much of the fact that we sought to excuse away inaction in Bosnia on the proposition that it was a \\"tragedy\\" generated from \\"ancient hatreds.\\"  It was nothing of the sort, in Power's view: it was a campaign (and not that easy a campaign) conceived and executed by real people in real time.  This is a point of great importance.  I am not certain that she makes her case.  But it certainly is a central issue, and she is quite right to direct our attention to it.<br />Given such plenitude, what more could one want?  Here is a suggestion:  given the almost distinctive range and depth of her experience, I would have loved to see her give more thought to what might have worked better and why.  This would have required, I suspect, a good deal more analysis than she is disposed to provide.  To take just one example-the various \\"genocides\\" that she discusses, while perhaps all equally \\"evil\\" (who cares about ranking here?), are also, one from another, rather different.  Pol Pot in Cambodia ran a campaign of extermination based on ideology, perhaps on class.  The Rwandans who murdered 800,000 Tutsis acted on (ancient?) ethnic hatred.  The Serbs who sought to push around the Bosnians and the Kosovars acted on ethnic of class motives - and while there was no shortage of brutality, they seemed more interested in displacing people than in actual murder.  So also Saddam with the Kurds: he apparently intended to punish them (for cooperating with Iran) and probably to drive them from their homes, but it is not clear that he intended to exterminate them.<br />As I say, I am not trying to set up a rank ordering of evil here: I am suggesting that different problems probably require different responses and I would have liked to have heard more from Power about what might have worked where.<br />Indeed, I will generalize this point.  Power is quick to suggest that the West (particularly the United States) could have done this, could have done that.  She is right enough in the abstract. She itemizes a baffling array of excuses posed in the path of action.  Again she is right.  Still, the fact remains that not all courses of action are equally viable: some are more likely to work than others, some cost more than others, for some the cost may be truly unacceptable.<br />Her defenders will answer that this is a job for generals and presidents, not for journalists.  True only so far.  Power probably has as much experience with the problem as anyone alive.  We need her views not only on what went wrong, but also on what might go right.<br />Footnote: other reviewers have accused Power of telling lies about the Armenians.  I'm really not the best judge of that.  I tend to believe her, but I'm not really competent to argue the point.  But here is a suggestion: if you think she is (or might be) wrong about the Armenians, skip that chapter.  It is interesting as a matter of history, but has nothing to do with the core of her narrative.I would have liked to have heard more from Power about what might have worked where.<br />Indeed, I will generalize this point.

I came to it as almost every reader will come to it: after having read almost everything of her more famous sisters'.  I don't know what I was expecting - perhaps something paler or more insipid.<br />Pale and insipid it is not.  Anne Bronte's prose is fully as energetic as the others', and she has a world-view that equally as rich, nuanced and fully realized (how /could/ they have thought so much, and about so much?).<br />The plot here, as any casual observer knows, revolves around the woman yoked to a loutish husband.  Some have perceived this as more original or daring than her sisters' plots, and certainly in her own time, it received a special kind of disapprobation (even Charlotte appears to have thought it cut a bit close to the bone - apparently perceiving that the lout was patterned on their own dear brother).  Maybe so, but in another sense, you could say that it is just the mirror image of the Jane Eyre plot.  Mr. Rochester has a guilty or scandalous secret about his wife; Mrs. Huntington has the same about her husband - not the same secret, but equally eligible for secrecy.  Each has an innocent lover; in each case the point is to disentangle from the guilty and join with the innocent.<br />The device of the loutish husband is not necessarily all that promising.  In the hands of an amateur it is no more than a setup for a tedious account of outraged virtue.  Indeed if this were all, we would do well to leave it for the Jerry Springer show.  The reason this book works is that it is not just a tale of outraged virtue: Mrs. Huntington makes it clear just how much she was attracted by Mr. Huntington: how she walked into this bog on her own, and against all the entreaties of her nearest and dearest.  As if to cap it all, we are treated to the spectacle of an older, more chastened Mrs. Huntington trying to warn a younger companion off from making the same kind of mistake.  We readers can make up our own mind as to what the young companion is likely to do.<br />Unfortunately, after a bit of this, the modality of outraged virtue takes over.  Huntington wallows in vice; Mrs. Huntington remains a saint.  Even here, the author does not lose us: she is a remarkable dialectician, and I am not sure the case of the woman wronged has ever been put better.  What is missing is an important human truth: vice (to use the Victorian term) is catching, and suffering does not purify.  Indeed, that is one of the things so dreadful about suffering.  You cannot put up with someone like Huntington indefinitely before some of it wears off on you.  It beggars all expectation to suppose that Mrs. Huntington could have come through all this without meanness, without spite, without the slightest hint of schadenfreude.  Indeed on this point (dare one say it), Jerry Springer just might be a better guide.  But life is too short for that.  Instead, thank heavens for the Brontes, and what a pleasure to learn that Anne is just as absorbing as the rest.p our own mind as to what the young companion is likely to do.<br />Unfortunately, after a bit of this, the modality of outraged virtue takes over.

What is missing is an important human truth: vice (to use the Victorian term) is catching, and suffering does not purify.  Indeed, that is one of the things so dreadful about suffering.  You cannot put up with someone like Huntington indefinitely before some of it wears off on you.  It beggars all expectation to suppose that Mrs. Huntington could have come through all this without meanness, without spite, without the slightest hint of schadenfreude.   Indeed on this point (dare one say it), Jerry Springer just might be a better guide.   But life is too short for that.  Instead, thank heavens for the Brontes, and what a pleasure to learn that Anne is just as absorbing as the rest.	2004-01-25

This has always been true but it is amazing how far mainstream finance has gone to try to resist the comparison.  The resistance must be, must have been more cultural than economic, because it is axiomatic that anything is a bargain at the right price, and that there is no more or less money to be made in \\"distress investing\\" than in any other.  Two generations ago, there seems to have been only one person in American that really understood this point - the late Max Heine, who made his grubstake by investing in out-of-favor railroad bonds in the Great Depression, and then riding the wave of prosperity that emerged in World War II.  In the same vein, 40 years ago just about any bankruptcy judge would have looked on an \\"assigned claim\\" as some kind of monster.<br />Times have changed.  Now everybody's an arbitrageur.  The \\"vulture investors\\" have their conferences, their social clubs, and for all I know, their own softball team.<br />Stuart C. Gilson\\"s \\"Corporate Restructuring\\" symbolizes the sea change from the old attitude to the new.  It adds the imprimatur of the Harvard Business School to the notion that vulture investing is just another way of making money.  As others have noted, this isn't a work of high theory - indeed it has a kind of slapdash, direct-off-the-photocopier feel that is remarkably common in business publications.  For fancy theory, you look elsewhere - in law to the likes of Douglas Baird or Lucian  Arye Bebchuk; in finance to the developing lore of \\"real options.\\"  But the case studies are an excellent device for getting a sense of the texture and possibilities of vulture investing.  It can be read with profit alongside Hilary Rosenberg's \\"The Vulture Investors.\\" Ambitious students who want the full theoretical framework will match it with David G. Luenberger's \\"Investment Science.\\"  But Gilson's work has merit on its own as one kind of  introduction to this revolution in investment thinking.ion to this revolution in investment thinking.	2004-01-22

Several Barsetshire novels and \\"The Way We Live Now\\" are likely to get pride of place.  This is probably fair enough.  But that fact says more about the merits of the other books than of any defect in \\"Phineas Finn.\\"  It isn't perfect, but it is a very satisfying novel, indeed - perhaps the best \\"political\\" novel since Disraeli's \\"Sybil,\\"  It is \\"political,\\" that is, not in the sense that it tackles big issues, as \\"Sybil\\" does - \\"Phineas Finn\\" gives a once-over to voting rights, tenant rights and the Irish but it's all somewhat perfunctory.  No: it is \\"political\\" in the sense that it is about the lives and fortunes of a public man, and of those who offer help or hindrance on the way.<br />The core elements of the plot are fairly familiar: callow youth sets out to conquer the world and finds out that it's trickier than it looks.  Impetuous young woman enters into marriage full of high hopes only to find out that she is stuck with a bad deal.  But then, you don't read Shakespeare for plot.  I wouldn't say that Trollope is Shakespeare.  Still, it is impressive how much by way of character and situation both writes can milk out of a structure that is almost haphazard.<br />Other commentators have also noted that the ending to \\"Phineas Finn\\" is weak, but I don't see that as a crippling vice: I'm hard put to think of a really good novel whose ending is not weak.<br />One of the many notable facts about the cast of characters is its great range: we have the home folk in Ireland.  We have a marvelous portrait of Finn's landlord, the law-copyist, and his employer, the successful barrister - in each case, along with their wives.  We have a narrow-minded country squire and a feckless young playboy.  And we have a sketch, brief and incomplete but still convincing, of the grandest peer in the realm.<br />Aside from the sheer breadth of reach, the other thing to be said about the cast is the extraordinary range of interesting women.  Phineas, devil that he may be, catches the fancy of at least one back home in Ireland and three more in London.  Trollope is often good with women and here in particular he shows remarkable sympathy and comprehension of what they are up against.  And not least of the three is, of course, the remarkable Madame Max Goesler, who is surely in contention for recognition as the most remarkable  Trollope character at all-for a lady named Max with a touch of a moustache, she is a Victorian sexpot.<br />It would be fun to read this in comparison with Henry Adams' \\"Democracy\\" another novel of politics in more or less the same period, though on another continent.  Meantime, I'm clearing time to read the rest of Trollope's \\"political\\" novels, in the hope that he maintains the high standard that he has set here.thing to be said about the cast is the extraordinary range of interesting women.

Or at any rate, Mrs. Ramsay, the heroine of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" does not, and there is no suggestion of any irony in her thought on the topic:<br /> \\"Everything depended upon things being served up to the precise moment they were ready. ...  To keep it waiting was out of the question. Yet of course tonight, of all nights, out they went, and they came in late, and things had to be sent out, things had to be kept hot; the Boeuf en Daube would be entirely spoilt.\\"<br />Well, if you know anything about the kitchen, you know that this is nonsense.  Boeuf en Daube is probably the last thing that needs to be \\"served up to the precise moment ...\\"  As Elizabeth David says in her \\"French Provincial Cooking:\\" \\"there must be scores of different recipes for daubes in Provence alone...  essentially a country housewife's dish.\\"  And more to the point, per Ms. David:<br />\\"The daube is a useful dish for those who have to get a dinner party when they get home from the office.  It can be cooked for 1 ½ hours the previous evening and finished on the night itself.  Provided they have not been overcooked to start with, these beef and wine stews are all the better for a second or even third heating up.\\"<br />I wonder how many English majors from the 1950s sold their souls for a good Boeuf en Daube (did Sylvia Plath have the recipe?) - and how much better off they would have been if they'd seen through it: understood that Mrs. Ramsay did not get the point, because Ms. Woolf did not get the point. Indeed, strictly speaking, the creation is not Mrs. Ramsay's at all, but you'd have to be a sharp-eyed reader to catch on: it is the servant who does the work and delivers the finished product and she, I suspect, knows better than her mistress how flexible and compliant it may be.  There is an irony here and it is lost, I suspect, on the mistress and on the mistress' creator.<br />All of which leads to a larger point: Virginia Woolf does not know servants.  Instance in particular her observation of Mrs. McNab, the old char who comes to reopen the summer house after long disuse.  We get an elaborate set-piece description of Mrs. McNab, and it is not pretty: indeed, it is mean-spirited and dismissive in almost every way.  Mrs. McNab \\"lurches\\" and \\"leers\\"  She \\"was witless and she knew it;\\" she sings \\"like the voice of witlessness.\\" Now, if this is true, it is inexcusably rude: one may want, for some artistic purpose, to show her lurching and leering for, but here it serves no purpose, unless you count its actual function in throwing light on the author.  Anyway, the chances are it is not true.  My guess is that Mrs. McNab has operated under far more constraint in life than either Ms. Woolf or Mrs. Ramsay ever dreamed of.  Witless people do not survive under the iron whim of a Mrs. Ramsay; poor chars who do learn to survive will find that it takes all the skill one can muster.<br />I could go on, but I need to stay within Amazon's 1,000 word limit.  The point is not that \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is a bad book.  It's actually quite a good book;  or at least it is a book full of good paragraphs, and Virginia Woolf seemingly cannot write a bad paragraph.  It is as bad novel, because Virginia Woolf has little of the capacity for imaginative empathy that makes a really good novelist.  They say that Shakespeare stands as a void at the center of his plays because he has poured every part of his being into his characters.  Virginia Woolf takes almost all of her characters into herself.  It is well done, but often we get to know more than we really want to know.o a larger point: Virginia Woolf does not know servants.

US	47529156	R3KHAJ1U7RVLEY	0198246730	561638088	The Philosophy of Schopenhauer	Books	5	87	89	N	N	A Lucky Convergence	Bryan Magee is an ideal candidate for the role of expositor of Schopenhauer.  One of Schopenhauer's defining characteristics is his passion for the arts; it is a passion that Magee shares.  Schopenhauer is as good a writer as you'll find among major philosophers, and Magee is an easy and graceful stylist himself.  Moreover, Magee is a bit of an outsider.  And Schopenhauer, for all his appeal, has never quite made it to the first team among philosophers.  Indeed, one of the most intriguing points about him is that he seems to have exercised far more influence over artists: Turgenev, Proust, Mann and (most of all) Wagner.  Indeed, as a kind of afterthought, Magee offers a \\"conjecture\\" that a Schopenhauerian substrate underlies Dylan Thomas' great short lyric, \\"The force that through the green fuse drives the flower ...\\"<br />It's a lucky convergence because Schopenhauer certainly needs an introduction.  Not because of the style: as I said above, Schopenhauer is a wonderful stylist, exactly not what you expect from a 19th-century German.  But if Schopenhauer did not end quite in the mainstream of western philosophy, he certainly started there.  He venerated Kant and he hated Hegel. He set himself the task of finishing or correcting Kant, without ever modifying his admiration for the master.  This means that to understand Schopenhauer you need to know something about Kant.  And here, Magee does a wonderful job.  Magee's introduction to Kant would, with minor emendation, stand pretty well on its own.  His exhibition of how Schopenhauer fits into the Kantian framework is equally deft.<br />In the same vein, he offers an indispensable strategy for reading Schopenhauer.  Schopenhauer is one of those authors who wrote only one book \\"The World as Will and Idea.\\"  The standard edition is two volumes: a first volume that he wrote as a self-contained work, and a second, which counts as a kind of \\"extension of remarks\\" that developed over the rest of his life.\\"  But before his great work, he wrote a dissertation, \\"On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason,\\" which Magee declares to be \\"a minor philosophical classic.\\"  It is, at any rate, an integral part of Schopenhauer's lifelong project, and a reader of the major work will do well to have the dissertation (or at least Magee's summary) behind him.  A couple of other \\"independent\\" essays help to fill out of the frame.  One of Magee's many helpful courtesies is that he tells you just what and why.<br />This book is so good in its own right that one is hesitant to seem to criticize Magee for not writing even more.  Still, Magee's account did whet my appetite to know more about how Schopenhauer fits into the tradition of German thought to which he made himself such an outsider.  That would be a project in its own right, but you do get a bit of it in the second-best book about Schopenhauer that I know of: Rudiger Safranski's \\"Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy.\\"  But hey-read them both, and with luck, they will carry you on to Schopenhauer himself.his great work, he wrote a dissertation, \\"On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason,\\" which Magee declares to be \\"a minor philosophical classic.\\"  It is, at any rate, an integral part of Schopenhauer's lifelong project, and a reader of the major work will do well to have the dissertation (or at least Magee's summary) behind him.

Don't feed him peanuts feed him opiates, buy your tablets at the gate from Miss Diamond who has given many years of service,  who sacrificed her vacations, her virtue, that this firm might go on.'  He subsided, to his own relief; collapsed into the chair that Nora drew up for him.  `To sex and its many ramifications,' he said, and raised his glass.\\"<br />Okay, it is out of context.  But in context or out, I defy anyone to catch all the layers of meaning there, at least not on first reading.  It's not precisely obscure (although I don't think I catch everything), not Joycean or Kafkaesque.  It's more like a James Wood movie monologue: the narrator has no skin at all and she process on six channels at once, certainly the quickest-witted observer you could want to imagine.  Or a \\"Simpsons\\" tape, where you know you will catch something new at second look, and some of the music gags will still go clean on past you.<br />Try it again for the rhythm.  Can you get it?  I cannot quite, but I am pretty sure it is there: all gnarly and snarky, all elbows and knees, a mind and a sensibility all its own.  Just to get in the swing of things, I found I had to read it out loud, but no matter: it was better that way, and it lasted longer.<br />Tess Slesinger subtitles it \\"A Novel of the Thirties,\\" and that it is: an attempt at clear-eyed observation of her cronies and adversaries among leftwing New York intellectuals at the bottom of the Depression.

More pointedly, for several years, to be about the only one you could find with any regularity at a Barnes & Noble or a Borders.  Funny, because they seemed to stay in print, and they were easily come by in England (and, of course, Italy).  That may be changing: I get the impression they are being promoted more aggressively right now than ever before.  Still, my take is that they remain sufficiently obscure that they could do with a little more tub-thumping.<br />The question is-what do you read mysteries for?  I suppose those who really care about plot - who set the book down at page 150 and try to sort it out for themselves.  I confess I've never been that kind of a mystery reader - far too passive, and anyway, just not that good at it.<br />The other reason to read a mystery is for all the throwaway \\"knowledge\\" you get, or think you are getting along the way.  Sherlock Holmes for London Fog.  Joe Leaphorn for Navajo Indians.  Lovejoy for antiques.  And, of course, Donna Leon for Venice.  I gather from the dust jackets that she is an American who has spent a good chunk of her life teaching English in Italy.  The corollary is that she answers the kinds of questions about Italy that I would want to ask.  I guess you'd say I've spent just enough time there to know that I don't know very much.  And I've got enough paranoia and gullibility to be a sucker for more.<br />Leon fills this bill nicely.  She makes it clear that she still sees Venice as heart-stoppingly beautiful.  And she has some kind words about the food (odd, that - Italy might be my first choice for food, but in Italy, not Venice).  And she's a great hater: hates the Mafia, the Vatican, the American military (in no particular order) - along with neo-Stalinist architecture, the kid sex trade, and a long list more.<br />For this, you can forgive some shortcomings.  In a field where the bar of plausibility has never been set high, her protagonist surely ranks as one of the most implausible.  She clearly thinks him sweet and loveable: I confess I just find him saintly, but I'll forgive him that.  The plots are uneven - some seem pretty tricky, others less so, but as I say, I'm not sure it counts for a lot.  And she can be a bit of a scold.<br /><br />But she's got a nice feminine knack for making me feel (while I'm reading her) that I'm just the most knowing guy in the world.  Just you and me and Inspector Brunetti, eh Donna?  Nice feeling.  Bene, grazie.ecture, the kid sex trade, and a long list more.  <br />For this, you can forgive some shortcomings.

I read it once when I was younger (in Paris, where you think I might have caught the spark), but my mind was on other things and I finished it more out of duty than pleasure.  Years later, I gave it a second shot, and I must say I'm glad I did: I suppose today I might rank it as my favorite novel.<br />I think what the reader needs - what I needed - was a feel for the context.  Stendhal stands at the crossroads of so much that is interesting in the modern world.  He's a Frenchman who is in love with Italy.  He's the small town boy who yearns for Paris - but then is shocked to find it has no mountains.  He's the soldier who rode with Napoleon - but the wrong way, having accompanied the great man on the retreat from Moscow.  Most of all, he is the ultimate romantic and the ultimate anti-romantic-the great enthusiast with a deadly eye for the absurdity of his own enthusiasm.  I think I needed to have some sense of all these dimensions before I could catch the ironies and cross-currents that give the book so much of its drive.  But lately, I don't know how many times I've found myself reading some later novel or some bit of more recent history and hearing Stendhal's worldly chuckle at my shoulder.  It's the mellow wisdom of a life not always well lived, but for that reason perhaps more tangy and flavorful than a duller counterpart.<br />One of the many charms of the experience to me is to reflect that Stendhal himself was - okay, say it, a loser.  He reminds me a bit of the Fusco Brothers in the Sunday funnies: not fat, exactly, maybe a size 40 in a pair of size 38 pants, the guy who never quite gets the girl (don't believe all his stories).  All this stuff about how they would appreciate him in 100 years: look, that's bravado, and forget about the fact that it also happened to be true.  One giveaway is the almost pitiful display of gratitude he fell into when he learned that he had been discovered by the great Balzac.<br />Other reviewers have complained about translations, and here is a suggestion: at least on second reading (it deserves a second reading), try it in French.  My own French is marginal, but Stendhal's is pretty straightforward.  He said he used to practice by reading the French civil code: I think that was a joke, but the fact is that at least in the passages of pure narrative,  you can pretty much move along.  Also: one of the more attractive aspects of French nationalism is that they are pretty good at buffing up their certified celebs.  It is easy to get good intelligent (French) \\"study guides\\" and such.

The consequences were not, perhaps, what you might expect. In the event, when we studied Herodotus, she would chatter on about the background, the characters. When we came to Thucydides, without nearly so much to entertain her, we just read the Greek.<br /><br />Good thing, too. Herodotus' Greek is not elegant, and it is not pure Attic. But it is accessible to the relative novice. Thucydides, on the other hand, is about as hard as it comes - made worse by the fact that he is most accessible where he is least interesting, which is to say in the passages of pure battle narrative. It is in the \\"reflective\\" passages - where his \\"characters\\" are trying to explain or justify their actions, or where he is simply trying to make sense of an appalling calamity - that he is most obscure.<br /><br />Is this an accident? I think not. Thucydides is, after all, an originator. He is perhaps not quite the first to give us a narrative of events, but he is surely the first to try to make sense of it all. And to recognize the path taken by his own beloved country as the course of stark strategy. It is the story, in short (at least at one level) of how a nation perhaps too rich and too self assured, can go terribly wrong.<br /><br />It was fashionable to cite Thucydides in the dark days of the Vietnam War. I wonder if the comparison shows us too much flattery. For Thucydides' story is not only a story about the arrogance of power. Athens at its best was a priceless treasure. Anyone can throw away an opportunity, but some opportunities are better than others.<br /><br />Suggestion: of all the readers who responded to the challenge of Thucydides, none met it more dramatically than Thomas Hobbes, the British political philosopher who began his career by fashioning the first great English translation of the Peloponnesian War. Hobbes' 17th-Century translation is perhaps not the most accessible, and I gather it is not the most accurate. But Hobbes has a gnarly directness of his own, and echoes of Thucydides reverberate through just about everything he later wrote.a gnarly directness of his own, and echoes of Thucydides reverberate through just about everything he later wrote.	2004-01-05

He's serious and well-informed, without having fallen play to the kind of celebratory cheerleading that you get from so much battle reporting. At the same time he conveys compassion for the suffering that warfare inflicts, without letting himself become shrill. The combination allows him to claim a kind of relevancy for his subject that either of those rejected extremes might forbid him. Wars happen, and they matter, and they are fought well or badly. And - this is perhaps a point of special urgency - they could have happened differently.<br />For surely it is easy to forget just how chance a business war can be - as the Second World War surely was. Keegan gives you a hundred ways to play the game of what might have been. If the Americans had been more alert to the possibility of attack at Pearl Harbor; if Hitler had not shown such sentimental foolishness as to throw in his hand with his Japanese allies; if Stalin had not liquidated all his own best generals - and this is only the beginning.<br />Keegan is also enlightening - or at least thought-provoking - in his assessment of relative roles. Partisan warfare was full of heroes and martyrs, but it didn't amount to much - think of the butchery at Warsaw, or in the high planes outside Grenoble. \\"Dirty tricks\\" - OSS spy games and suchlike - provide the stuff of good movie plots, but they counted perhaps even less. Code-breaking, by contrast, counted for a great deal, perhaps most in the run-up to Midway, itself surely the most important naval battle of the war.<br />In the end, why did the Allies win? A thousand reasons, perhaps, but in the end the good ones are dull and obvious. Good organization, good (not perfect) generalship, good logistics and support (Overy, Why the Allies Won (1997) develops this theme). And - perhaps most of all - massive industrial productive capacity, mostly in America, but significantly also in the Soviet Union, where the desperate race to move factories beyond the advancing Nazis in 1941 paid huge dividends in 1944.<br />How could it most easily have gone otherwise? On the record, Keegan himself might nominate the various battles of the North Atlantic, including the dreaded U-Boat campaign. Superior American productive capacity prevailed over the Nazis in the early rounds, but technical innovations later began to shift the balance. Had the War not been won when it was on land, Keegan suggests, a renewed sea battle might well have swept the tide back the other way., where the desperate race to move factories beyond the advancing Nazis in 1941 paid huge dividends in 1944. <br />How could it most easily have gone otherwise?

This is troublesome. Just how am I supposed to react here? In love with his own wife? Is it a surprise that Candaules is in love with his own wife? Is this a joke? Or is something lost (or gained) in translation?<br />But let that pass. If you saw the movie &quot;The English Patient,&quot; you may remember the rest of the story. You recall that Gyges the house servant, at the behest of the Candaules himself, hid behind the curtain and saw the queen naked. . The queen (Herodotus does not give her a name) observed the observer, and next day - backed by her armed guard - she confronted him with a stark choice: either you kill the king, or we kill you.<br />Rawlinson says that Gyges &quot;made a choice of life for himself,&quot; which is good enough. But Herodotus says that Gyges decided to &quot;perieinai,&quot; and perhaps nothing in the whole work better exemplifies the peculiar genius of the author. &quot;Perieinai&quot; translates roughly as &quot;to be there when it is all over.&quot; The touch is light, deft and pointed - as someone has said, almost Mozartian in its seeming ease. All this in just about the first prose narrative ever written.<br />&quot;Histories&quot; is too grand a word. In one sense, Herodotus is the guy down at the end of the bar cadging drinks for stories. But no one ever did it better, and no one makes it look easier (which, surely, it is not). The question remains: was Herodotus in on the joke? I like to think that yes, just maybe he was.	2004-01-05

Apparently it has never been published in the United States, although it was widely available in bookshops in London as recently as a couple of years ago (and it appears to be available at Amazon UK).  The lack of a United States edition is a shame.  Nobody better understands than Blake the grand tradition of the conservative governance in Britain. He his chief claim to fame is a biography of Disraeli which, after 40 years, has surely taken its place as a classic in the form.  He was for many years Provost of Queen's College, Oxford. This book (which began life as the Ford Lectures at Oxford in 1968) is in part a history.  But it is much more: it is a meditatation on the meaning of conservatism and on the task of governing.  In a time when conservatism in the United States seems to have lost all coherence -- and when the Conserve Party in Britain has declared itself broke -- we can well use the stimulus of such a clear thinker and elegant writer.	2004-01-03

If you read only one book about Shakespeare, perhaps it should not be this one.  There are others that give a better introduction to his peculiar appeal.  But if you want to know about cultural icons - how they are born, how they mature and die - then you could hardly do better.  Shakespeare is, after all, among literary figures the icon of icons (perhaps only Homer can compare).  And Bates does a delightful job of sketching just how it all came to be - what we have come to expect of Shakespeare, what sort of dreams and visions we map onto him. And he does it without losing sight of the fact that Shakespeare may indeed deserve all our admiration, even if not always in the form or for the reasons that we suppose.	2004-01-02

He was prepared, at a pinch, to forego the tiger-skins.&quot;<br />It's a representative beginning.  A typical Collier hero is a young man with big dreams, beaten down by poverty and respectability.  He longs for seashores and good champagne, but one wonders whether he ever actually has a date (perhaps he wonders himself).  His powers are the powers of the weak:  sneakiness, sometimes with the aid of the supernatural.  The supernatural, as any reader knows, is not always reliable: Franklin Fletcher's tale ends on a note of grisly comedy.  The best comparison I can think of is Saki, laced by Gissing and with just a dash of Poe.<br />These Collier stories were hugely popular among people whom I held in high regard back when I was in college in the 50s.  I can't say I entirely liked them - the stories.  The snarkiness was entertaining, but unsettling: probably it hit too close to home.  Rereading them after nearly half a century, it's easy to see why one would want to put them back in print.  They have plenty of intrinsic merit.  But I think they have a side-benefit, perhaps unintended: I think they are a bracing reminder of the 50s and what one (read: I) might have hated about them.  Try this:<br />\\"In Hell, as in other places we know of, conditions are damnably disagreeable.  Well-adjusted, energetic, and ambitious devils take this very much in their stride.  They expect to improve their lot and ultimately to become fiends of distinction.\\"<br />That was fine if your deviltry was \\"well-adjusted, energetic and ambitious.\\"  Otherwise you had to settle for smaller consolations,  one of which, surely, would have been the stories of John Collier.  Reading these stories, then, may be a kind of nostalgia trip.  It may not always seem like a nostalgia trip one wants to take, but as Jane Austen says, one may love a place even if one has suffered there.  And in any event, Collier is surely good company along the way.ys, one may love a place even if one has suffered there.  And in any event, Collier is surely good company along the way.	2004-01-02

This is a most interesting and instructive textbook, but I am not entirely clear  just what its intended audience might be; I suspect it may be mistitled. From my perspective, the title &quot;Advanced Corporate Finance&quot; suggests some fairly heavy duty mathematics.  In fact, there is nothing here of that sort; indeed the level of math is no higher and perhaps lower than you would find in a standard &quot;basic finance text.<br />What we have here instead is a very helpful collection/summary of material on the institutional framework of corporate finance -- the kind of stuff you might wish your students knew before they ever started the technical part.  Short of that, it has another good use: it's what you might call a &quot;bottom drawer&quot; book, i.e., one of the books the professor keeps in the bottom drawer to deploy for classroom examples -- thereby garnering an undeserved reputation for breadth of knowledge.  This can only be bad news for the publishers: it means they sell only one copy rather than a whole classroom full of copies.<br />I can only conclude that the publishers understand their own business better than I understand their business: maybe there is a market for whole classrooms full of copies, and more power to them if they find it.  Meanwhile, I cherish my bottom drawer copy and I look forward to many more occasions when I can stun and astonish with the authors' good help.	2004-01-02

The Acheson years were indeed &quot;the creation&quot; of a lot, but Alfonso might have done even better to be in Paris in the Spring of 1919, in time for the peace conference that sought to sort out the consequences of World War I.<br />Perhaps the most vivid inference the reader carries away from Msrgaret MacMillan's crisply informative account of the peace negotiations is the sheer volume of what was accomplished.  This is not necessarily a good thing: life might have been better for everyone if they had done less.  But the impulse to bring home a finished product must have been overwhelming to take them as far as they did.<br />Undertaking to cover so much within manageable limits, MacMillin has made an organizational choice that is not entirely satisfactory, although it is hard to think of a better: she has organized her material topically, instead of chronologically.  This undoubtedly improves readability: far better to handle the Serbians (say) at a go, rather than having to remember where they were when last you saw them, after a gap of weeks or months.  The cost is, of course, that it obscures the way in which the separate threads do impinge on each other: what happened to the Serbs on Tuesday may have something to do with what happened to the Palestinians on the Monday, just by way of example.<br />MacMillan also exercises what must have been heroic self-denial when it comes to second-guessing or, indeed, to any kind of evaluation.  She does suggest that she doesn't think the treaty is quite the cock-up that a lot of its detractors believe.  But even here, she doesn't really press the point, leaving plenty of room for the interpretations of others (or perhaps for her own, in another book, later?).  But it is easy to come up with particular questions which cry out for commentary.  Why, to take just one example, did the Hungarians do so badly at the conference?  One speculates it has a lot to do with internal difficulties at home during precisely the time when the Hungarians needed to make themselves felt at Versailles -- but this is more a guess than any kind of informed judgment.<br />Even in the absence of any judgment on the part of the author, some conclusions seem to commend themselves.  Most notably, I don't see how anyone could come away from this book with an enhanced opinion of Woodrow Wilson.  We've grown up on the teaching that Wilson was an &quot;idealist,&quot; and I suppose this is true.  He was also rigid, sanctimonious, and crashingly uninformed.  One finds oneself far more at ease with the cheerful cynicism of Clemenceau and Lloyd George.<br />MacMillan has clearly covered a daunting array of original sources here, although perhaps not quite as much as you might guess.  The vast majority of her sources seem to be English.  Indeed, the only other language that I find in her primary-source list is French.  English and French would surely be any researcher's firs two choices.  But it certainly leaves room for others who work in German, Russian, Arabic or heaven knows how many other languges.<br />All this is, of course, asking a lot, and it shouldn't detract from what Macmillan has accomplished: she has produced a brisk and readable narrative of what actually happened.

It's about money, power, greed, betrayal -- what's not to like?  More particularly, it is one of those courses where students come in bearing such low expectations thaqt their only surprises will be pleasant.<br />Of all the accounting materials I've been exposed to, none is more fun to teach than this book by Brownlee, Ferris and Haskins.  There is an introductory chaper of nuts and bolts.  But then, the bulk of the book is made up of case studies in accounting analysis.  With bright students (I use it with second- or third-year law students), you can do a whole course from the standing start.<br />Whenever I teach accounting, I tend to treat it as a \\"fraud\\" course--try to find the gimmick.  In general, students are uncomfortable with the approach.  They tend to think of accountants as nice people and their a not always happy with my seeming cynicism.  Post-Enron (and WorldComm, and Adelphia, and Parmalat, etc. etc., etc.), I am tempted to call up all my former students and say -- \\"See?

Therefore what a pleasure it is to find that Betram D. Wolfe's &quot;Three Who Made a Revolution&quot; is back on the shelves.  I read it first when I was in school -- one of the first serious or challenging &quot;adult&quot; books that I read with pleasure.  I'm a little chagrined to recall some of my own responses.  On the one hand, I remember entertaining the uneasy sense that the book was probably too much fun to be &quot;real scholarship.&quot;  Maybe a little -- but in retrospect, I think most of the fun comes not from mere clowning, but from Wolfe's real engagement with the humanity of his subjects.  On the other hand, I remember writing in a term paper something along the lines of how the book would probably put a damper on further research.  I think I knew as I wrote it that this was a pretty fatuous remark, but hey, I was on a deadline.  Anyway, it is nice to be able to recognize in retrospect that (a) it of course certainly did nothing at all to dampen further reserach; but (b) despite the torrent of further research, it still repays rereading.<br />Wolfe wrote at a time when the left was still pretty gullible about Communism.  There was, of course, an anti-communist opposition: in the long run the antis have proved to be more right than the apologists, but it is not so clear how much this is the result of careful research, how much of lucky accident.  At any rate, giving a few points for hindsight, Wolfe's moral clarity is in retrospect pretty clear.  And whatever his imperfections, he probably motivated me to read a lot of stuff I might otherwise never have come to: I remember particularly Trotsky's own autobiography, Adam Ulam's &quot;Unfinished Revolution,&quot;, and Robert V. Daniels' &quot;Documentary History of Communism,&quot; all of which I read in the weeks after I had finished Wolfe, and while I was still operating in his wake -- to say nothing of whatever I have picked up in the generation or more since.

Throughout a long and productive career, John Lukacs has taken pride (sometimes bordering on preening) in his penchant for defining things his own way.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it just a distraction.  But no subject is better suited to his mix of talents than this &quot;historical portrait&quot; (as he puts it) of this the capital of his native country.<br />The book is a nostalgia trip in part, but it is a good deal more.  Lukacs also undertakes to to situate Budapest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and in particular, in contrast to its great partner, Vienna -- it's remarkable even today how these two cities, so close together on the map can seem so far apart.<br />But perhaps the best part of the book is in his chapter on &quot;Seeds of Trouble,&quot; when he undertakes to show how liberal nationalism went sour and headed down the road to anti-semitism and the destructive hyper-nationalism that wracked us all through so much of the 20th century.  Liberal nationalism had always contained the seeds of its own undoing.  Discerning politicians as disparate as Disraeli, Bismark and Napoleon III had already grasped how the liberal impulse could be harnessed to conservative ends.  But through Lukacs' eyes, you can see just how quick and subtle -- and disastrous -- the shift can be.  Probably the point is that Lukacs was never a good liberal to begin with.  So he can look on with unblinkered eyes as the liberal vision crumbles in his hands.<br />For all of Lukacs' aristocratic disdain, it is possible for a reader less austere than the author to see this shift as a disaster.  Perhaps a good pairing for this book would be Gordon A. Craig's &quot;Triumph of Liberalism&quot; about Zurich in a slightly earlier time: there you can be reminded (if you need reminding) of just how refreshing the rise of liberalism could be.<br />Lukacs has a final chapter called &quot;Since Then,&quot; but it's perfunctory.  There's certainly a story to be told about 20th Century Budapest, but you wouldn't come here to find it.  On the other hand, as an exercise in archaeology -- of the substrate that underlies our more recent battles -- this book is hard to beat.e's certainly a story to be told about 20th Century Budapest, but you wouldn't come here to find it.

At the same time direct the seller to resell them in your behalf in New York.  But inform your buyer/seller that the New York diamonds  need not be identical with the Antwerp product: any comparable diamonds will do.  It's not immediately obvious how this turns Europe money into New York money: but I suppose if the New York buyer gets the gems but does not pay for them, then his New York seller can offset against the Antwerp account.  So the gems are loose to do their good work in New York and the account in Europe is closed out.<br />If you are a gem merchant, you probably knew this: apparently your family has been doing deals of this sort since 1350.  As I am not a gem merchant, this trancscontinental fandango is one of the many things I learn in reading Alan Furst's \\"Kingdom of Shadows,\\" one of the half dozen espionage novels in which Furst undertakes to recreate the atmosphere of Europe on the eve of World War II.<br />For Furst, I can thank Brad de Long, the Berkeley economist who runs a great weblog.  De Long says he gives copies of Furst novels to incoming grad students to remind them that the 20th Century was not always as triumphal as their ending.  A good choice: I gather Furst himself says he keeps in his workroom a picture of the Austrian writer Joseph Roth, perhaps the greatest expositor of the mood of apocalyptic doom that overlay any thoughtful person in a decade when it looked as if the future lay with either Hitler or Stalin.  Indeed, characters in \\"Kingdom of Shadows\\" attend Roth's funeral. \\"It was probably a good thing,\\" says one of these characters, \\"that you coudln't commit suicide by counting to ten and saying /now/.\\"  In fact, Roth himself did something very close: he drank himself to death in despair over the storm clouds that lay all around.<br />It's certainly risky to take your history from novels, but I must say whenever Furst writes about things I (think I) know, he seems to get him right.  Therefore I am inclined to take his word on others.  For example -- who knew that the Hungarian national anthem declares (declared?) that \\"this nation has already paid for its sins, past and future\\"?  Or that \\"the slow, meticulous grinding of civil servants\\" has a German name -- \\"Schreibitschtater,\\" that is \\"desk-murderer\\"?  I don't think I'm giving away too much here: Furst has stuff life this on almost every page.<br />It is remarkable how readable these novels are when you consider (as others have noted) that he's actually pretty weak in a lot of the basics of the novelist's art: his plots are slack and his characters are pretty much cardboard -- except in the sense that they are all struggling to hang on in troubled times.  But at least many of them get to do their struggling in Paris, which ought to be some consolation.  One thinks of an epigraph, quoted in the introduction to Mavis Benchley's \\"Paris Stories\\" -- from Shakespeare's \\"As You Like It:\\" \\"Ay, now I am in Arden, the more fool I.  When I was at home, I was in a better place, but travellers must be content.\\"<br />Also on my desk as I read Furst is \\"My Century\\" by the Polish poet, Aleksander Wat.  Wat contrasts the 30s with the 20s: he points out that in the 20s, we were maddened by the sense of almoswt limitless possibility--futurists, dadaists, god-knows-what-ists, all responding to the new world opening up in the aftermath of the Russian revolution.

Must ask). &quot;Disapproval&quot; is probably too strong a word to use for anyone with de Tocqueville's stoicism and aristocratic detachment. But he certainly knows that the revolution is upon us. At the same time, he understands the responsibilities and opportunities of governance. The persistent question is: if we are to have democracy, how do we fashion one where good government can prosper?<br />De Tocqueville's &quot;French Revolution&quot; is more compact, less discursive then his &quot;Democracy in America&quot; because in France, he was not a tourist. This is both a strength and a weakness. His points are crisp, direct and forceful, and you never get over your admiration for his acuity.

Guido de Ruggiero does not quote this old canard but it is a pretty good summary of his views in this book, which cries out to be reprinted. It's about the best succinct summary I ever saw on the topic of how liberal society/government comes into being.  He shows compellingly how liberal society is something grown, not created and how 'new' states (including, in his own time, Italy) that merely try to copy some Western example are headed for trouble.  As a quick summary of English/British history it is dazzling. As a short course in academic political theory, it would be a good crammer for an exam.  It would be an excellent pendant to Richard Pipes' discussion of the &quot;patrimonial&quot; tradition in Russia (in Pipes' 'Russia Under the Old Regime,' which I also review in its place).  One detects a strong aroma of this book between the pages of Fareed Zakaria's much-publicized recent book, 'The Future of Freedom.'

Not a mean achievement for a lifetime, and so one not to be forgotten.	2003-12-29
US	47529156	R3D6QZ87O7PO5D	0393310353	323732312	Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life (Norton Paperback)	Books	4	107	116	N	N	Shoot into the Air	Larry, Mo and Curly have undertaken a three-way duel. There will be two rounds. In the first round, each player gets one shot - first Larry, then Mo, then Curly. At the end of the first round, each survivor gets a second shot, in the same order. Larry is a poor shot, with a 30 percent success rate. Mo is better: he hits 50 percent. Curly never misses.<br />What should Larry do? The answer is that he should shoot into the air. By wasting his shot, he maximizes his chances of survival. Such is the analysis of the authors of this remarkable introduction to game theory.<br />One virtue of this book is its geniality: For Dixit and Nalebuff, game theory is full of anecdote and surprise, and they give you the sense that they like nothing better than to share their enthusiasm with others.  (Geniality footnote: I probbly shouldn't noise this around, but one day I ran into a problem with an equation in a (different) Dixit book.  I sent him an email; I got a response in an hour).  A tradeoff for geniality is that they pay a price in structure: to get a coherent framework - even for some of their own best stories - you may have to go elsewhere (Professor Rappaport's textbook may be a good second choice). But it is hard to find any book that does better at conveying a sense of the excitement and challenge of game theory as a discipline).<br />Comparison shopper's note:  I've used this in working with law students. Game Theory for Lawyers, by Baird, Gertner and Jackson, might seem closer on point. But it lacks those little four-block boxes that are a staple of game theory instruction, and for a beginner is bound to be pretty impenetrable without them.	2003-12-29

Let me speak here in law teacher mode: if you wanted to read just one book as background for law school, I think perhaps this should be the one. It's a model in terms both of substance and of presentation. In substance, the authors have done an admirable job of summing up the best available knowledge about the economy and how it came to be. In presentation, what they've done is to take an array of technical or specialized studies and to make them accessible to the determined non-specialist.<br />I remember it in terms of so many wonderful anecdotes. There are the farm girls from Vermont who staffed the mills in Massachusetts until the great Irish immigration drove them back to the farm. There are the restless young men from the prairies who rode the rafts down river to New Orleans, and then set off to see the world. There are the canals that lost all their capital value with the coming of the railroads - but then kept operating anyway, because it was more worthwhile to use them than to tear them up.<br />This is not, of course, precisely a law book. But it is a book about issues for the law: about slavery, about public land policy, about the structure of industry and finance. The chapters on the Great Depression alone would make a sufficient background for any course in constitutional or administrative law.  For the authors, only two words: new edition.	2003-12-29

Our Country is an effort to put the same sensibility to work in a narrative history. Barone has absorbed a lot and forgotten little, and he likes to remind the reader of things others are more likely to forget. Civil rights, for example. One wing of the Republican party had its roots planted firmly in the abolitionist movement, dating back to before the Civil War. You could call it &quot;the Eisenhower wing,&quot; if you were clear that it did not include Eisenhower. As general, and later as president, it seems fair to say that Eisenhower just didn't get it - not so much hostility to blacks as a kind of blank incomprehension - why weren't they willing to keep the place (one is tempted to make comparisons with General Sherman). Lyndon Johnson, by contrast, is one who emphatically did get it. Vulnerable and insecure as he always saw himself, Johnson was able to show real empathy for the plight of American Blacks. So we have the kind of irony so familiar in politics - the soldier-statesman who didn't get it, imposing a civil rights bill on Congress against the best efforts of the cracker politician who did.<br />Barone obviously relishes the irony there, but he likes the story in particular because of an even more consistent enthusiasm. That is: he is fascinated by the hard work of governing, which he comes close to glamorizing in its very unglamorousness. You can see it perhaps best in his appreciative account of a man who he nominates as a forgotten progenitor of modern social legislation - Robert Wagner, the senator and father, inter alia, of the Wagner Labor Relations Act. Without Wagner, as Barone tells it, the New Deal's legislative agenda would have been a lot more insipid. It perhaps explains also his affection for Hubert Humphrey - a name perhaps mostly forgotten today, or remembered if at all only in the sour aftertaste of the 1968 presidential election, which he lost to Richard Nixon.<br />What perhaps gives zest to Barone's account is that for all his skill as a data-miner, he believes at the end that politics is culture and not economics that divides us or draws us together. It impels him to insist that there is a society more important than its contentions and divisions, more than the sum of its parts - in some sense, a res publica, or (back to Barone's title here) &quot;Our Country.&quot;  Only one afterthought: this is another book that cries out for an new edition.l only in the sour aftertaste of the 1968 presidential election, which he lost to Richard Nixon. <br />What perhaps gives zest to Barone's account is that for all his skill as a data-miner, he believes at the end that politics is culture and not economics that divides us or draws us together.

I suspect not. Tuchman combines an impressive learning with a knack for catching you up in her narrative. She also has what comes very close to being a schoolgirl crush on General &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; Stilwell, the somewhat equivocal protagonist of her story, and betrays her own share of that complex love-hate relationship with modern China which has served as so strong a force in modern world politics. Taken together, these qualities make for a compulsive read, but they perhaps lend themselves to a certain suspension of disbelief.<br />Stilwell came into World War II as an acknowledged leader among his military peers. He had been scheduled to command the first American offensive of the War, when he was sen instead for the job which became the definition of his career -- the task of making China into an effective military partner. Even with all critical receptors on stun, one does sense that Stilwell embodied many of the virtues you would want in the job. He appears to be decent, high-principled, hard-working, with a keen sense of public order - but in the last analysis a fighter which is, after all, the one thing a general is supposed to be (he reminds me a bit of William Tecumseh Sherman). Moreover by just about anybody's account, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek, as the leader of wartime China, was a piece of business. Perhaps even more than Stalin, Chiang was an accidental man - a smalltime thug who got caught in the updraft and found himself at least the titular head of a world power. But Stalin coupled his good fortune with an unparalleled ruthlessness and peasant savvy. It is probably an empty question whether, in the end, the Chinese were tougher to dominate than the Russians, or whether by contrast Stalin was simply better at the task of domination than Chiang. Still, Chiang in retrospect seems far more the passive object of events than the active subject.<br />It is easy, then, to understand all of Stilwell's frustration, and to appreciate his sense of lost possibilities. Yet the fact remains that Stilwell missed futon the one item that would have made his case most convincingly, and that is success. He may have helped to fend of disaster in Asia, and he may have done a bit to make the Chinese army more effective (and the life of the Chinese soldier more bearable). Yet in the end, Stilwell's record in China survives as a chronicle of lost possibilities. What if Chiang had been a bit more forceful as a leader, or at least receptive to Western help? Yes, but what if Stilwell had been a bit more sly and ingratiating in trying to meet the Generalissimo on his own terms.<br />It is surely a virtue of Tuchman's narrative if you can read this kind of ambiguity into it, even if it was not what she intended. This doesn't pretend to be a definitive introduction to modern China (Jonathan Spence's In Search of Modern China probably stands as canonical for the moment). But for capturing the allure and the bafflement with which the West approaches China - and for painting an attractive picture of an attractive guy - Tuchman deserves full credit.ustration, and to appreciate his sense of lost possibilities.

Sherman (Library of America)	Books	5	21	24	N	N	&quot;The Most Magnificent Army in Existence&quot;	&quot;What Dercyllidas said of the court of Persia may be applied to that of several European princes, that he saw there much splendor but little strength, and many servants but few soldiers.&quot; So Adam Smith (although it was not Dercyllidas but Antiochus). In an anecdote, he thereby captures the essence of classic small-r Republicanism: a society of individuals who are fit, self-sufficient -- and armed. It is the model that gives such sentimental appeal to the campaign for the right to bear arms.<br />Was there ever such a society? Doubtful. But if you wanted to find one, you would have done well to show up on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. a little after 9 a.m. on the morning of the 23d of April, 1865, to review the Army of the West in review formation behind its commander, William Tecumseh Sherman. Here, from his memoirs, is Sherman's own account.<br />&quot;When I reached the Treasury-building, and looked back, the sight was simply magnificent: The column was compact, and the glittering muskets looked like a solid mass of steel, moving with the regularity of a pendulum. . . . It was, in my judgment, the most magnificent army in existence - sixty-five thousand men, in splendid physique, who had just completed a march of nearly two thousand miles in a hostile country, in good drill, and who realized that they were being closely scrutinized by thousands of their fellow-countrymen and by foreigners. . . . The steadiness and firmness of the tread, the careful dress on the guides, the uniform intervals between the companies, all eyes directly to the front, and the tattered and bullet-riven flags, festooned with flowers, all attracted universal notice. Many good people, up to that time, had looked upon our Western Army as a sort of mob; but the world then saw, and recognized the fact, that it was an army kin the proper sense, well organized, well commanded and disciplined, and there was no wonder that it had swept through the South like a tornado.&quot;<br />Sherman had reason to be proud. One assumes that his name still evokes bitter memories around Atlanta where he tore up and twisted so many miles of rail track. But Sherman was, ironically, the kind of general who is good for victor and vanquished alike. He had the temperament of a fighter, but he knew that the goal of fighting was not to shed blood, but only to win. His campaigns inflicted legendary damage but most of it was swift and highly focused. There was some pillage, but even the pillage seems to have been planned and organized and permitted only to the extent necessary for the campaign. In all the accounts that I have seen, there is little or no talk of rape.<br />It is a commonplace that good soldiers make bad writers, but the evidence is not so clear. There is a reason why Caesar and Xenophon persist as staples of the classical curriculum. Ulysses Grant, who was said to write military orders so clear that they could not be misunderstood, himself produced a military memoir of great vigor and force. But it is hard to think of anything that will compare with Sherman's own account - particularly his narrative of the long march from Lookout Mountain across George and then up through the Carolinas to the Capital and the end of the war. If there ever was a time to be optimistic about the future of a free citizenry, surely the day of that great parade was the day.>Sherman had reason to be proud.

Not me, I can assure you. As it happens, I lived in Cleveland for a few months in 1954, while the Sheppard fandango was in full flourish. I think I had the uneasy sense then that there was something unseemly about the media (more precisely - Louis Seltzer's Cleveland Press) and its bacchanal. I never doubted - until years later - that the underlying verdict was really wrong.<br />The Hiss-Chambers conflict is perhaps more complicated. Chambers' charge that Hiss was a Communist agent stood or fell on Chambers' say-so alone. It's true that Chambers, as an influential senior editor at Time Magazine, was in some sense the creature of the publisher Henry Luce, and in any event had plenty of loud advocates from the start. But Luce himself never seems to have known quite what to make of Chambers, and Luce was far from eager to embrace Chambers after Chambers swept himself into the center of the maelstrom. Meanwhile Hiss, with his cool, civilized, aristocratic (except he wasn't, really) demeanor just couldn't be guilty - except, it turns out, seem even on the left (Jerome Frank is a remarkable example) felt uncomfortable with him from the start.<br />Tanenhaus' biography is a model of detached sympathy. He pretty clearly got himself inside Chambers' skin, but he leaves not the slightest doubt that Chambers was one extremely weird guy, not in any sense the man you would choose to stand as the defender of Western Civilization. Likewise he is at pains to show how Chambers, a conservative ideologue by any measure, remained his own conservative ideologue, never the catspaw of so many who were eager to use him (example: Chambers never had any truck with Joe McCarthy). That may offer a certain solace for all those of my generation who couldn't bear to believe that Hiss was guilty, but have to accept now that Chambers was probably right.  My only regret is that this fine biography is out of stock: it's an important story and it would be a shame to see it fall into a crack.uilty, but have to accept now that Chambers was probably right.

Sartre has an entry, and so does Derrida, and Lacan. Thirty years ago, you would have expected to find an entry in this index for Claude Levi-Strauss. No more. Translations of his principal works appear to persist in print, but the sales numbers are look low, and he seems almost to have disappeared from the trendy book reviews and such.  This is perhaps a matter for at least idle curiosity: Levi-Strauss is surely no more abstruse than his magisterial contemporaries - but no less so; one is perfectly willing to be relieved the obligation of ever picking him up again.<br />With one exception. In style and temperament, Tristes Tropiques is so different from almost everything else Levi-Strauss wrote that it is hard to believe it is written by the same man. Oh, the primitive tribes are there, and a brief personal intellectual history, that offers a bow to Freud, and Bergeson, and Saussure. In my own copy, which I first read about 1980, I even have a pencilled notation &quot;structuralism&quot; - this at page 375 (Pocket Books edition, 1977). But there is almost none of the portentous vacuity that you had to cope with in the so-called &quot;serious&quot; works.<br />What you get instead is Levi Strauss the raconteur, full of travelers' tales. He dines on roasted parrot, flamed with whisky. The termites make the earth rumble. Virgins are made to spit in pots of corn, to provoke fermentation - but &quot;as the delicious drink, at once nutritious and refreshing, was consumed that very evening, the process of fermentation was not very advanced.&quot; You almost expect the anthropophagi and the men whose heads grow beneath their shoulders, that you meet in the Voyages of Sir John Mandeville, Knight.<br />Laced through it all, you get a kind of austere sadness which is either (a) a tragic view of life; or (b) a kind of self-indulgent posturing, depending on your temperament for skepticism. &quot;Every effort to understand,&quot; he says, &quot;destroys the object studied in favor of another object of a different nature.&quot; Or: &quot;Anthropology could with advantage be changed into 'entropology', as the name of the discipline concerned with the study of the highest manifestations of [a] process of disintegration.&quot;<br />Well, call me anything the like, they say, as long as you call me for dinner. It might even be an elaborate con. But so, for that matter, might the stories of Herodotus were you get the same mix of the eclectic and the tolerant, the surreal and the sly.

This may or may not be good physics, but it is great social theory. Case in point: the WASP, the white Anglo-Saxon protest so famed in song and story. It is David Hackett Fischer's peculiar virtue to point out that there never was such a thing. Or more strictly - that the early settlers who came from the British Isles fall into not one, but at least four disparate categories. New England Puritans were not Pennsylvania Quakers who were not Midatlantic Catholics (sic). Take them all together and they were none of them the least way like the Scotch-Irish who came later and swept back into the hills, whence they spilled forth over half a Century or more to dominate our political life..<br />You can see it on the map, of which Fischer offers several. They came from different places. They brought different alliances and their own particular betrayals, and a range of subliminal traditions that distinguish them one from another.<br />One good example is relations between the sexes. The Puritans were a \\"patriarchic\\" people by 20th Century standards, but they believed that God spoke to men and women alike - so at least you had to listen to what you say. The Scotch Irish, far more close to nomadic in their way, would have none of it. Fischer shows how a Scotch-Irish wedding, however merry an occasion for all concerned, is stylistically a ritualized rape.<br />Fischer has hundreds of pages of this stuff, but it is perhaps the politics that is the most interesting. It wasn't the descendants of John Adams who dominated our public life (his great-grandchild, Henry Adams, wrote the great American parable of the superfluous man). It was the likes of Andrew Jackson, John Calhoun, James Polk - strapping and lean, with sunken cheekbones, often violent. It is a tragic irony that the violence they inflicted on the slaves and the Indians virtually mirrors the violence they suffered from the landlords over generations before they came.<br />Fischer is a master at destroying a generalization: he does a bravura job of turning one statistic into four. But there is no reason for the process to stop there. The \\"first wave\\" of Puritans necessarily came first, with all that the term entails. The latecomers had to go a little further, settle for less attractive land, occupy more humble positions in the social structure. Categories within categories: follow this logic to its conclusion and you face the depressing prospect of knowing nothing at all. But there may be no other way. Hegel said God had to live through the world; otherwise he would have remained mere abstract possibility. So follow the logic and you get to see, not nothing, but everything there is to see.r />Fischer is a master at destroying a generalization: he does a bravura job of turning one statistic into four.

The sheep-stealers in question are the nations of the Balkans, whose politics, evidently, were enough to frustrate even this most adroit of intriguers. Perhaps happily for him, he did not live long enough to see the world do exactly what he feared.<br />There are two ways to get a grip on those Balkans -- a short way and a long way. The short way is through &quot;The Bridge on the Drina,&quot; by the Slavic Nobelist, Ivo Andric. The other is the great, sprawling monstrosity (cited above) by Rebecca West. Andric's novelized account of a near-millennium of Ottoman rule is a marvel of (if nothing else) concision. Individual set-pieces are unforgettable: the account of an impalement is not for the faint of heart.<br />But anything as compact as Andric's narrative must necessarily expose itself to a charge of oversimplification, That is one charge few could bring against West's 1100-odd pages (not including index and bibliographical note). This is an irony, because West on the surface appears to have an agenda so simplistic as to be crude: the Yugoslavs are a species of noble savage, while their North European &quot;betters&quot; - more precisely, the Germans, are a gang of buffoons. Her caustic sendup of life in a train compartment with a party of German tourists is hilarious in its own right, and it surely didn't hurt her as the book hit the market at the beginning of World War II (also: it is near the beginning, so anyone who wants to claim to have read the whole will want to get at least that far).<br />But facts do her the kindness of getting in the way. Agenda or no, West is one of the world's great reporters, with an enviable capacity to see not just what she wants to see, but rather what is before her eyes. The result is the best kind of journalism, and the best kind of history: a book full of exceptions &quot;We are too rough and too deep for your smoothness and your shallowness,&quot; her guide tells her in a fit of impatience. &quot;That is why most foreign books about us are insolently wrong.&quot; West must be wrong about a lot of things: any book so rich in detail and texture would have to be wrong about something. Thanks to her good efforts, it will be harder for her readers to be wrong.t is the best kind of journalism, and the best kind of history: a book full of exceptions &quot;We are too rough and too deep for your smoothness and your shallowness,&quot; her guide tells her in a fit of impatience. &quot;That is why most foreign books about us are insolently wrong.&quot; West must be wrong about a lot of things: any book so rich in detail and texture would have to be wrong about something.

Pipes means to denote &quot;a regime where the rights of sovereignty and those of ownership blend to the point of becoming indistinguishable, and political power is exercised in the same manner as economic power.&quot;<br />&quot;Despotism,&quot; Pipes continues, &quot;has much the same etymological origins, but over time it has acquired the meaning of a deviation or corruption of genuine kingship, the latter being understood to respect the property rights of subjects.  The patrimonial regime, on the other hand, is a regime in its own right, not a corruption of something else.&quot;<br />This is a brave assertion, and Pipes remains faithful to it.  Indeed, the core of the book is perhaps his chapter entitled &quot;The Anatomy of the Patrimonial Regime,&quot; where Pipes tries to show how utterly different is the tradition of governance in Russia from the tradition in the West -- even in Western nations that we might think of as &quot;reactionary.&quot;<br />There are other virtues to this book.  His introductory chapter on the environment is perhaps worth the price of admission, as he retails the grim arithmetic of topsoil and grain production.  His discussion of serfdom provokes all kinds of questions about the relationship between serfdom in Russia and slavery in the West.<br />A work of just 318 pages can hardly pretend to be the last word on the history of a great nation, and Pipes maintains no such pretention.  I take it as given that much more could be said to inform, expand upon, or criticize, Pipes' perspective.  But as a framework for approaching the study of Russia, it is hard for me to see how it could be bettered.  As a provative contribution to the literature of political analysis generally, I should think its claim is equally strong.8 pages can hardly pretend to be the last word on the history of a great nation, and Pipes maintains no such pretention.

It is history in the grand style, but with a message that is simple and powerful: people are pack animals.  They will be governed -- sometimes in a haphazard or mediocre manner, often appallingly, once in a while really well.  Not least among its many virtues, the set shows better than a thousand stumps speeches just what is so distinctive about the tradition of liberal democracy, and how it came into being (for more detail, pop over to the separate Amazon page for Volume 2 of this set and read the instructive comments of &quot;Amazon Customer&quot;).<br />A motivational message to prospective readers who are dismayed by the prospect of a three-volume set. You don't need to read all of it to get value for your money. You don't even need to read it in sequence (I did not).  Perhaps the most accessible parts are in Volume III, especially Books IV (&quot;The Re-creation of the State in Europe) and Book V (&quot;Pathways to the Modern State&quot;).  From there you might want to go back to Volume II, specifically Part III of Book III, more precisely still Chapter 7 on &quot;The Republican Alternatie: Florence and Venice,&quot; followed by Chapter 8 and its magisterial discussion of &quot;Representative Assemblies.&quot;  From there a natural course is back to Volume I and its discussion of Athens and Jerusalem (Finer is particularly good on the distinctive contribution to governance from the tradition of the prophets).  This is a Western-centered view, and should not be read to distrct attention from Finer's extraordinary treatment of the Chinese, the Indians and the societies of the Middle East.  But these are in some sense self-contained units and can be addressed on their own terms.<br />This backwards progression would leave for last the stuff that Finer put first: the &quot;Conceptual Prologue,&quot; which is perhaps better understood as a summary and analysis.  But whatever route you take, surely there is no end of riches in this extraordinary capstone to a great scholarly life, well lived.in some sense self-contained units and can be addressed on their own terms.<br />This backwards progression would leave for last the stuff that Finer put first: the &quot;Conceptual Prologue,&quot; which is perhaps better understood as a summary and analysis.

US	47529156	R1Z45ZNJCOISCO	094032282X	495393176	The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian (New York Review Books Classics)	Books	5	13	16	N	N	Three In One	I took Chaudhuri's autobiography along on both legs of a cross-country plane trip.  Good choice: this tale of old Bengal is sufficiently remote from the cares and demands of my ordinary life, I would have been a long time getting to it at home.  But the constraints of coach class are just the place to come to terms with its prickly, difficult and high-principled author.  At 535 pages, the book is not short, but I don't think I would want it shorter.  Chaudhuri has a big subject -- not just himself, but the whole of a culture -- and you need this breadth to capture it.  Besides, it is not really one book; it is at least three.  It is a bildungsroman: the story of a boy's maturation in a dark time.  It's a magic-lantern guided tour through the Bengal of his youth, now irretrievably lost in the mists of history.  Finally it is a shrewd and challenging--and highly personal--account of life under British rule.  As they say on SNL, it's a candy mint /and/ a breath mint, a floor wax and a dessert topping.<br />More specifically--Chaudhuri is full of (pardonable?) rage against the gobsmacking cheek of the old-fashioned British occupiers, their pretense and their presumption.  But he is the product of a British education, the child of Mill and Burke, and at the end of the day, he wouldn't have it any other way.  Such a dual perspective makes him at best a a reluctant and critical onlooker in the great subcontinental uprising.  It positions him as a critic of even that most untouchable of 20th Century icons, Mahatma Gandhi.  Indeed, far from wishing for less of a book from Chaudhuri, still when it comes to politics, I can only wish there were more (I haven't read &quot;They Hand, Great Anarch!&quot;, his other big book, which I gather is a kind of a pendant to this one).  Still, it's a gift as it is.  &quot;India has merged,&quot; he says near the end of this great work &quot;in the stream of European expansion, and forms part of those portions of the world which constitute a greater Europe, which, as I see it, will ultimately come to mean the whole world.&quot;  Maybe.  At least from the standpoint of 1951 when he first published, it seems prescient.  And it is wonderful to have him along as a guide.a greater Europe, which, as I see it, will ultimately come to mean the whole world.&quot;  Maybe.

This is odd, in a way: Claude was an old man (and in pain) when Jean got to know him, and Jean was an old man when he finally brought his recollectios together. You might expect cranky, but nothing of the sort: it's a book full of sunny afterglow.  Every parent would hope to be rememnbered so well.<br />The book might take a bit of getting used to: Jean has his own pace and his own way of telling his story.  We did it in small doses and I'm not certain yet that I quite catch the rhythm.  None of the rough edges have been smoothed off which, come to think of it, is just as Claude would have wanted: Jean speaks with his own voice.  You have to listen well, but you know that the voice is nobody else's.<br />I suppose it helps to know a bit about the Impressionists to enjoy it all, but I can't say I know all that much, and I didn't feel impaired.  Anyway, God bless Google: more than once, when Jean talked about a painting or a subject, I key-clicked my way to an image and completed (as it were) the picture.<br />Kudos also to NYRB (this time) for producing what it does not always produce: a finished physical specimen  The paper feels like quality; the binding is sturdy, and there is a small but satisfying selection of pictures, both colored and black-and-white.  There is even an index of sorts (I assume from the original translator) but it is patchy and incomplete.  That last is a shortcoming, but forgivable in light of the book's other virtues.  In the NYRB firmament, this is surely a star.	2003-12-27

This translation first appeared, I believe, in 1929 and has been available in recent years from both Dover and Da Capo.  One, (or was it both?), carried an excellent preface by the distinguished scholar of the Renaissance, Thomas Bergin.  NYRB does not republish Bergin.  It does republish the original 1929 introduction (by Arthur Livingston, once a teacher of Italian at Columbia) but with no hint of its provenance and, so far as I can discern, no mention of the date (the biblio page gives you a hint when it mentions a \\"renewal copyright\\" dated 1957).  There is also an LC entry identifying \\"Livingston, Arthur, 1883-\\" but I doubt very much that Livingston was still alive when NYRB published in 2000.  There is a preface by the distinguished music-scholar Charles Rosen, but it is beneath him: a slapdash affair that does little aside from assuring us that Italian olive oil is now available everywhere in America.<br />Aside from these matters of production - the text itself is absorbing and instructive if you understand what you are getting.  Da Ponte's only real claim to fame is, of course, that he is the librettist of Mozart's three great comic operas.  Da Ponte cheerily declares that Mozart was the greatest composer of his time - perhaps the greatest ever - yet he gives this greatest of all composers perhaps a half dozen pages out of the entire 472-page text, less than any of a dozen other drifters and dreamers or down-market impresarios whom he met along the way.<br />Rather than reading it as a work of music criticism, you can take it as a loose-jointed adventure story, in the tradition of Casanova (Da Ponte claims him as a friend) or Benvenuto Cellini.  A perhaps more interesting comparison would be to Stendhal's \\"Charterhouse of Parma\\": readers who are scandalized that Da Ponte gives such short shrift to Mozart will recall that Stendhal's hero trekked all unknowing through the Battle of Waterloo.  I suppose it is just possible that Stendhal read Da Ponte: I have no idea whether he did in fact.  But it doesn't matter; the comparison adds a gratifying resonance anyway.<br />Moreover, even if this book is not remotely useful as direct criticism of Mozart, I think it does cast the great libretti in a new light:  you come to understand the schemers and seducers of the Mozart operas were not a mere nonce creation: they accompanied Da Ponte throughout the whole of his long and rumbustious life.  \\"I trusted them and they betrayed me...\\" would be a pretty good title for the whole.  You can certainly tire of his preening, his score-settling his tale-telling.  Indeed you come pretty quickly to realize that not 100 percent of it can possibly true.  How much, then?  80 percent? 50?  20?  Of course I have no idea: maybe 50 will do as a guess.  But I don't think that matters either.  Recall what Goethe said about Livy: yes, they are just stories, but they are good stories.  At the end, I think you can give Da Ponte credit for his most (nearly) disinterested passion: his desire to spread Italian culture to the Anglo-Saxon world.  In this light, we can greet him on his own terms: se non e vero, e ben trovato.<br />Four stars for the book, one for the presentation.

US	47529156	R74XIBGM8QNSJ	0130151025	900717909	Finance	Books	3	9	10	N	N	Thumbs part  way up	Like others, I too first saw this book in paper.  I am now using it to teach a class of law students -- smart kids but mostly without great numeracy.  I think it is working okay but (like so many coursebooks?) perhaps not as well as expected.  One problem is indeed the typos -- I'm a sloppy writer myself and typos are my incubus, but with all the beta testing and with all the publisher support, you would think they could have done better (indeed, I sent my own list to the publisher back in the beta days -- I got a nice thank you but I don't see my name in the acknowledgments, so I suspect they hit the trash).  Aside from that -- the presentation seems mostly clean and straightforward, but quite often too elliptical for my students -- I've felt I had to do a lot of backgrounding. Unlike other reviewers, I quite like the problems -- I think some of them press the envelope a bit, but that is just fine with me, exactly what they should do.  I do feel that the authors bring together a remarkable lot of stuff in a compact and orderly manner.  In this respect with this book as with so many other coursebooks, perhaps it is the case that the teacher is getting more out of it than the student.	2002-11-08

There is a wonderful book here, but it is maddeningly difficult to extract from the text as presented -- ill-organized and repetitive and in  coverage, perhaps even haphazard (another reviewer note that they don't cover reserves -- true, and I wonder if this is simply an oversight?).  That said, this remains the best introduction that I've seen to games managers play (and in which accountants cooperate).  More extensive (and less jaunty) than Howard Schilit (Financial Shenanigans).  For broader coverage on the limits of accounting, move on to Eccles, etc., &quot;The ValueReporting (sic) Revolution.&quot;  After the dust settles from the Enron imbroglio, M&amp;C will surely want to do a new edition: here's hoping they keep the same wonderful content, with better focus and analysis.	2002-07-31

It's analytically ambitious, but nothing beyond the comprehension of a serious amateur.  It's also refreshingly free of the somewhat shrill celebratory preaching that you get so often in the genre.  I've been pushing it on law students with no econ background & have enjoyed gratifying success.  Please buy it so the publisher keeps it available.	2002-07-31

But for a broader view of the virtues and limits of accounting, Eccles and company have a lot to offer.  You can skip or skim the somewhat overhyped stuff about the &quot;ValueRevolution&quot; itself (note that three of the authors come from PricewaterhouseCoopers, where they seem to be having some trouble with their space bar, or spacebar).  Keep your best brain cells for chapters three through eight, where you get a look at the earnings obsession -- and just as useful, a suggestion of what investors really need and want.  Note that one of the co-authors (Robert H. Herz) is the new head of the Financial Accounting Standards Board).	2002-07-31

It's as if someone in a suit smelled a whiff of the lamp around here and exiled it to the ghetto of academic writing.  This is a pity, but it is perhaps in part understandable.  The nominal topic is &quot;evolution,&quot; but the real subject is the activity of clear thinking.  More directly -- no one excels Janet Radcliffe Richards in demonstrating how to use the tools of philosophy in the analysis or understanding of every day problems.  There is an audience for this sort of thing.  The publisher seems not to have found it and both auther and audience (saying nothing of the publisher) are the losers.	2002-01-15

If you judge it as straight narrative it is indeed weak.  But that's not its purpose.  Rather it is an attempt, mostly successful, at social history beyond narrative.  Read it with an ear for the detail: how the women's vote kept the Christian Democrats in power; how average civilian lifespan in Britain actually increaed during World War I-- and the wonderful bit about the disappearing wristwatch under the made-up red flag.  He's also good at the shrewd aside: how we know more about the lives of 17 people around Gordon Square than of all of Serbia.  As a title, \\"Fragments\\" is perhaps a confession more than a boast; Vinen does not always keep control of his material. But many of his fragments are too good to be missed.	2002-01-10
