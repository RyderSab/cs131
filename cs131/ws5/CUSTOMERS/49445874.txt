The characters of Abigail and Lillian seem very \\"real\\" to me in this book.  My only real quibble with it is that it seems that everyone falls in love so quickly.  I will admit that the book is only 318 pages long and that you have to move quickly in a book that short.  Lillian's story is so mysterious that when it is finally revealed, many things make sense. <br /> <br />The novel is about the anti-slavery movement in both the US and England, the westward expansion of the United States, a little bit of the political system of the 1800s, but mostly about how forgiveness can change a person's entire outlook on life.	2004-12-31

In fact, I just about gave up after 50 pages.  But I got on to Amazon, and after reading some of the other reviews, decided to give it until page 150.  Boy am I glad I did that! Once the book got going, I found it hard to put down. <br /> <br />There are many twists and turns, but the major plot revolves around Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, both magicians.  Their relationship is rather entertaining, and their various \\"hangers-on\\" contribute a lot to the side stories.  I found that I couldn't place it in any genre other than just fiction, because it is not your ordinary novel.  The ending ties up all sorts of loose ends, in a way.  It does leave an opening for a seqel, which I think would be interesting, but I don't think any sequel could match the majesty of this novel.	2004-12-31

I wondered how much of it at the beginning was true.  I suppose that if Mr. Halter did have the \\"Book of Abraham\\" available, he would be able to work off that.   <br /> <br />This is a story of one family's trials through the ages, all documented in a scroll started in 70 AD when the patriarch was expelled from Jerusalem.  The book continues, with great detail, up through WW2.  I am hoping that the book \\"The Children of Abraham\\" continues the story and that it answers the questions I have at the end of this book.	2004-12-31

The story spans about 30 years, and goes through the various trials and tribulations that each face separately.  I found that I could not put the book down, and that there was plenty of action.  The book was extremely detailed, and included many historial aspects that I found interesting--the fight between Stephen and Matilda, for example. I would recommend this book.	2004-12-31

I thought it was an interesting view of the royal court in China during the 1800s.  However, I got the feeling that maybe Orchid's actions were a little to present day to be believable.  However, people will do what they need to do in order to survive, so that may have been part of it.  I didn't completely understand the romance aspect--it never seemed to me that Orchid & the emperor connected on a level other than business-like.  I will probably look up other books by this author.	2004-12-08

In a way, it is similar to \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"  I liked how all the pieces slowly came together, but that the ending was a surprise.  I did feel a little let down over the ending, but that's because I wanted to see what Edward would do next and also what happened to Margaret and the Duchess.  But it was still an interesting book, and I will probably look for others by him.	2004-12-08

However, it wasn't because it was completely sad--it was funny, but in a sad way.  I liked how Sophie was able to rise above her grief in a way that spoke measures about how strong she was as a person.  I thought that Winston did a good job with Sophie's thoughts, especially those about the other people in the book.	2004-12-08

Having read every one of her books and seen most of the movies, I often wondered if she was like any of her heroines.  In reading this book, I began to understand her situation more.  A woman who was reliant on her brothers for a place to live, and money to spend, but who exercised a spirit of independence in her written word.   <br /> <br />Honestly, while I can see why Cass mutilated Jane's letters after her death, I think that it is truly a shame because we will never know what she was thinking during that period of her life where she wasn't writing at all, or at any of the other difficult times of her life.   <br /> <br />Tomalin's book was well researched and brought me into Jane's life as no other book has done.  I thought it was interesting to watch Jane's growth as a writer.  I was left with the thought that Jane imbued her heroines with a part of herself.  Whether it is Lizzie's intelligence, or Anne Elliot's situation in life, Jane's life was full of interesting events and people. Tomalin's book allowed Jane to shine.  A must read.	2004-11-27

Shakespeare is one of the most interesting literary personages that I can think of.  Greenblatt did a thorough job of explaining where Will came from and how he incorporated real-life events into his plays and poems.  While I truly enjoyed this book, and will recommend it to others, I am left with the feeling after reading the book that I still do not really know Shakespeare.  Not all the mysteries are solved, and I think that is part of the charm of this book.  We will probably never know why Anne Shakespeare received the \\"second-best bed\\" or what even made Will move to London and become a renowned playwrite.  What we are left with is a body of work so sublime that it is almost unequaled in the literary canon.   <br /> <br />I thought that the book was organized well, and that it flowed well from chapter to chapter.  I liked how the plays and poems were discussed in relationship to Will's life and the real-life events going on around him.  His capacity for remembering the smallest detail and looking beyond the outside of a situation is remarkable.  This book is definitely a must read.	2004-11-27

I kept expecting Jack to fall on his face and just chuck it all, but the author does a great job of making him into a human so that the reader can see what is going on behind the mask.  I thought this book was pretty true to life--relationship wise.  Sometimes, spouses expect too much of the other without actual communication, and when that breaks down, they need to figure out how to get it back.  I loved how Jack was able to re-discover his kids and his talent.  <br />A great book from a great author.  Enjoy!	2003-06-04

Personally, I loved the grandmothers' plotting and conniving to get their way--I thought it was hilarious.  That said, Lily &amp; Sean have never gotten along.  Then Lily is called back home to do a research project for her organization on the coral reefs in the area.  Sean is the mayor of the town, and they must work together and battle their way through all the hurt feelings of their youth.  <br />You will know what's coming, most of the time, but it is still a good read---it's fun just to see them try to get back at each other for supposed wrongs from the last 20 years.	2003-06-04

There were parts that seemed rather contrived, but overall, I liked the interplay of reality and myth, psychosis and sanity.  I think that this could be a good starting point for a *small* series of books about the Summer Country--maybe not the same characters though.  Parts of this book made me cry and others made me laugh out loud.  <br />I enjoyed this book and will look for other books by this author.	2003-06-04

And then there's the get-up for the party!! I know that it was written in teh 70s, but it's still hilarious.  I missed Al in this book, but I liked how Admiral Sandecker got a larger role in this one.  I think that this book illustrates the relationship between these two great men.<br />Sure, you know who the bad guy is towards the beginning, but the ending is worth the entertainment---fights at Disneyworld, only Clive Cussler would have pictured it.  There are plenty of twists and turns to keep the story moving, and enough changes in relationships to entertain.<br />&quot;My name is Pitt. Dirk Pitt.&quot;	2003-04-24

Even with the disclaimer from Mr. Cussler that this was the first Dirk Pitt book and he wasn't sure about publishing it, it was still good.  The action grabs you right off and keeps you guessing all the way through.  I liked how this book was shorter than some of the more recent Dirk Pitt novels--it just seemed to encapsulate the action and the beginnings of a true hero better. <br />I am glad I picked up this beginning novel of the series.

I have always found them to be incredibly well researched and deep.  Charleston does not disappoint.  The characters are interesting and well-rounded.  I particularly liked Alex, Edward and Edgar. Mr. Jakes incorporates some little known aspects of the American Revolution, and Civil War into this book.  I also liked how he occasionally mentions the Mains from &quot;North &amp; South&quot; in this book.  <br />There were times when the battle details went on too long for me, but over all it is a wonderful book--full of insanity, passion, and interesting parallels from the beginning to the end.<br />Enjoy!	2003-04-18

This book had me in tears at times due to the very emotional way Ms. Wurts has in writing about some of the characters' relationships--Arithon &amp; Jieret's for example.  Sure the text is a little wordy, but I think that without all the descriptions, we may not have as good a grasp on the landscape &amp; world as possible.<br />Some of the best sub-plots, I thought were the ones with Lirenda.  Sure, she's annoying and a complete witch, but at least she got what she deserved.  I loved the increase of Ath's adepts in this book.  I think they add something to the life of the book--I mean, they can disappear into thin air!  How cool is that? Most annoying character in this book has to be Elaira.  She was really interesting at one point, but then about 1/3 of the way through, she got really boring and annoying.  <br />The most entertaining characters in this book awards have to go to our favorite discorporate sorcerers--Luhaine and Karamandon (?).  With mediation by Sethvir and Dakar, the interplay between these two surely show their talent.  Add to that mix the introduction of Davien, and the players are all there.<br />As for Davien, I think the best part of the book, where we really got to see into Arithon's mind, was when he is with Davien.  But I don't want to spoil that...<br />I think this is a great series, and many things happen in this book alone to change the way the rest of the series may run.  I can't wait for the next book!	2003-04-12

This book could have been better if it would have just been combined with the last book and had 11 books in the series, but I guess that 12 is an even number, so there you go.  <br />This book sees the original Trib Force under seige, both at their safe house and in Petra.  This book has a lot of the action that the first books in the series had.  If you have read any of the other reviews, you already know that there is a cliff hanger at the end, which I thought was well done.  I began to see some of the characters become more human--like I knew more about them.  Of course, some of them became more &quot;Divine&quot;--knowing that the end was coming, they began to embrace that rather than their earthly life.  <br />Anyway, a good book that is more reminiscent of the earlier books in the series.  This book will make you cry and laugh and wonder.	2003-04-12

However, I skipped the entire middle bit and read the first 40 pages or so and then the last 50 pages or so.  I don't feel like I really missed anything (other than Vo was blind, I guess).   I found it really confusing to keep track of what decade the story was in and how many secrets Ruth Anne had.  Stuff happens before the book that I didn't figure out how it affected them until almost 10 pages in.  <br />It's probably a really good book if you can do stream of consciousness and flashbacks with no warning--I had problems with it this time.	2002-11-16

There's no major drama, or mystery, like the first one.  Rachel is intent on overcoming her blindness by faith, not by a powwow doctor.  Philip has come to realize that there is something missing in his big-city life.  <br />The title refers to the crossroad Philip must face in making his decision, and to the physical crossroad Rachel must face in order to move beyond her accident of a few years ago.  <br />This is a moving tale with a great ending...enjoy!	2002-11-09

John Tanner, one of the group, is approached by the CIA stating that the Ostermans are really involved in organized crime, as are the other members of the group.  <br />The story if full of miscalculations, deception, and cross-betrayals.

Rachel is blind because of the trauma of the accident; Annie wants her Mom to be able to see.  Rachel's parents are stuck in their beliefs--powwow doctors, strict, and I caught a hint of reliance on Rachel's blindness.  I have to admit that Rachel's mom Susanna really started to annoy me.  <br />A wonderful book with a great mystery.	2002-11-09

I picked this book up because it sounded really interesting.  I was not disappointed.  There is lots to this story that I probably could understand better if I would read the other books in the series, which I probably will.  <br />Sylvia finds some old quilts in an ancestor's hope chest, along with a journal.  The journal displays her ancestor's in a different light than what Sylvia was brought up to believe.  This makes it very interesting.  There is even a mystery that isn't solved at the end of the book--which leads to the question everyone asks at one point in their life--who am I?<br />Sylvia learns to trust her instincts and understand that it's not what you are percieved, but how you percieve yourself.  <br />An interesting, enjoyable book that I would recommend.	2002-10-29

But it was a fast read and an enjoyable one.  <br />I would recommend this book.	2002-10-29

I thought that this book seemed a little rushed at the end.  By about 1/2 way through, I knew what was going to happen at the end (if not earlier).  I thought that it was well written, but some story lines were just dropped--for instance, we never know what Justin's reaction is to Katie's decision, and we never find out more about Katie's life change at the end.<br />I did like how the Amish quilters were brought into the story.  Also, I liked how Daniel was written in.  However, I think that it is a little strange how, by the end of the book, a bunch of the Plain people are being &quot;saved&quot;.  As I said in one of my other reviews, I think there could be a little less preaching going on in the story, but it's ok. <br />There were emotional sections of the book, but I think that there could possibly be one more book coming in the series.  The book ended well, but there were still questions, in my mind...	2002-10-29

The story moved fairly quickly, with the usual background before the actual story.  The images that were evoked during the course of this book were hair raising--from Orion Lake to the Great Lakes.  <br />In this book, Dirk fights the dastardly Chinese multi-billionaire Qin Shang.  Qin Shang is importing illegal Chinese immigrants, and is also in pursuit of priceless Chinese artifacts.  Dirk is also fighting the White House, and his injured/tired body.<br />All in all, a good read--sure Cussler has a &quot;formula&quot; going, but that doesn't stop him from crafting a great story with many twists and turns.	2002-09-25

The story starts in the Pacific, off Australia/New Zealand when a luxury liner bursts into flames.  Then to the Caribbean with a dastardly plot to destroy a luxury submarine.  To the halls of Congress, and the ports of the US, Dirk Pitt is never out of place.<br />I read Dirk Pitt books because they are fun, not to look for things that are wrong or anything.  This book, like the others, asks &quot;What if?&quot;  What if &quot;20,000 leagues&quot; was based on a real story?  What if Vikings really did explore the US?  What if there was a super oil that never needed to be changed?  <br />In this book, Dirk actually begins to possibly regret the choice that he made a long time ago in not settling down with anyone.  He makes comments about getting older, and how age is beginning to affect him.  <br />The only thing that is kind of annoying is the fact that there are 2 prologues, which make sense AFTER you finish the book, but it takes until the mid-300s to even get back to them.  <br />All in all, this is a good book to relax with, and there are plenty of surprises in store at the end!  I can't wait until the next one!	2002-08-22

However, that did not diminish my pleasure in reading this book.  The characters from the other books are mentioned, but are not pivotal.  The title is a little misleading, as Helena does not remain in Avalon throughout the book.  I loved how the legend of Helena, the mother of Emperor Constantine, was woven into the Avalon legend.  That must have required a lot of research and effort.  <br />I thought that the characters were well written and interesting, except for Constantine. I found him to be whiny and egotistical.  This book allowed me to see the evolution of the Roman Empire and the evolution of the acceptance of Christianity in a whole new light.  There were times I cried and times I laughed.  But at no time did I not want to continue reading the book.<br />Enjoy!	2002-08-20

While it did entertain me for an hour or so, I didn't think it was a keeper.  The story should have been divided into two distinct parts, rather than the abrupt change at chapter 9.  The first part is from the point of view of Howard Carter.  The second part is a third person view of King Tut and his family.  There for a while I wondered why they had placed Tut's story after Carter, but then some of the nuts fell into place.  But the characters have no depth.  You don't get to know the Carter gang well enough to care, and they are very shallow.  Tut is shown as a spoiled, whiny little brat with his shallow wife.  The ONE thing I did find interesting was the theory behind Tut's death.  <br />Go ahead and read this book, but don't expect to be overwhelmed.  I enjoyed \\"Great Maria\\" much better.	2002-08-16

I know that maybe Ms. Tarr did rearrange some facts and/or leave/embellish some information, but that doesn't diminish the story for me.  This is a story about a young woman, who knows what she is capable of doing, and then does it.  That young woman is Hatshepsut.  She is married to her half-brother, whom she despises and whom she knows does not have the skills needed to be a good king.  She suffers, not always in silence, because of this.  Senenmut is her chief scribe and is visible throughout the story, not only as her friend and advisor but also as her lover.  I thought that it was a very touching love story.  <br />The story is filled with people who are intelligent and care deeply about the queen.  I felt like I knew the characters, they were so well written.  I guess it doesn't bother me about any historical inaccuracies, as long as the story is told well.<br />There were weak moments--the Puta expedition was one that stuck out in my mind.  But overall an interesting book.  I will have to look up \\"Child of the Morning\\" and see how it compares, since it is getting such good recommendations here.<br />Enjoy.	2002-08-15

For two days, between doing things I HAD to do, I devoured this book.  It is put together rather well.  Each story is a chapter, and then there is a chapter following with the commentary on the Bible, the story and the reason the leaders of various religions sought to supress the story.  Also what is interesting is that Kirsch places the actual bible verses in text boxes within the story, so that the reader can compare the two.  <br />As I said, I liked the whole book, but the part I read extremely closely was the last chapter on who wrote the bible.  I know that most fundamentalists probably won't read this book, but I think that it is an educational tool that everyone should read.  Kirsch points out that for thousands of years, men have censored the stories in the bible and changed them to suit not only themselves and their society, but what they deem appropriate as a political message or moral ideal.  <br />I would imagine that if everyone read the Bible as closely as Kirsch studied it for this book, they too would find the ambiguities or inconsistencies that are prevalent throughout.  <br />One thing I did find kind of annoying is that in almost every chapter of commentary, there were instances of Kirsch referencing forward or back to other chapters in his book.  That typically doesn't annoy me much, but I did seem to notice it in this book.  But the footnotes and explanations are good, so don't let that one peeve of mine destroy the experience.<br />Read this book, you will be glad you did.	2002-08-14

But it is not until he goes back to Canaan that he truly examines who he is and what he believes. <br />There are lots of little sub-plots in the book that keep it interesting.

I know that this was only a trilogy, but by the end of the book, I wanted to know what happened next. Heketah and Dorothea are able to connive their way into forcing Jaenelle to make a decision about who she is and what she wants.  Jaenelle's birth family has some hard decisions to make about their expectations.  I loved seeing the interaction between Surreal, Lucivar, Saetan, and Daemon.  There were moments at the beginning that broke my heart, and moments that I was cheering for the characters.<br />This was a good book to end the series with--many things that were mentioned in the other two books were finished off here.  I really felt that the ending left me hanging.  But there was a lead in (kind of) to the book &quot;The Invisible Ring.&quot;  I will probably read that book soon.  <br />There were storylines that could have been developed more, but the love story between Daemon and Jaenelle was very well written.  I would highly recommend the entire series to anyone.	2002-08-11

The premise of how Abraham changed his ways to believe in the one true and living God was interesting.  What I really enjoyed were Cahill's asides to the reader.  I felt that the people he described weren't these lofty, holy people but everyday folks like you and me.  This may be objectionable to some people.<br />This book may not be for the fundamentalist.  I think that it is probably more for people who are looking to find out the Who, the Why and the Wherefore of the ancient world.  I will say that in reading this book, I feel ilke I should check out Everett Fox's translation of the first five books of the bible.<br />I enjoyed this book, and will buy it later, in addition to the rest of his series.	2002-08-09

The addition of the coven and the &quot;boyos&quot; was good.  They made the book entertaining to read.  <br />Personally, I get a kick out of the names in this book.  They are just a little out of the norm, usually by just one letter.  It makes it much more interesting to read.  The last chapter was a perfect beginning to the next book, which I hope to read soon.	2002-08-05

I thought the characters advanced a lot in this book, as well as got more interesting.  However, if you are looking for BIG action, this isn't the book in the series for it.  There is lots of action in this book, but the final blow-out has been saved for its own book.  <br />Basically, the main characters are split into two groups--the group in present-day Eldh and the group in 1883 Colorado.  The Colorado group has to deal with fitting into the society and waiting for Jack to show up.  Interestingly enough, they have to deal with a vigilante group called the Crusade of Purity.  That could lead the reader to some conclusions between the book and a commentary on real life.  <br />The group on Eldh splits when Aryn has to go home to meet her future husband &amp; takes Melia with her.  However, this is ok, because she ends up facing up to her past actions that she thought were justified, and becomes stronger in her Craft.  The other group is trying to find Grace's sword and make it to the black tower.  Along the way, they meet some VERY interesting people....<br />By the end of the book, everything is in place for the beginning of book 5.  I can't wait.	2002-08-05

In fact, it pretty much starts the minute &quot;Roanoke&quot; ends.  It is mainly the story of Gilda &amp; Fallon and what happens after the slaughter of their village.  <br />Fallon is sent to England and Gilda is sent to live with her cousin Pocantas.  Fallon never forgets his incomplete mission--to watch over Noshi &amp; Gilda.  Gilda, being so young when the children were sent away, doesn't remember much of her previous life.  Eventually Fallon is able to go back to Virginia and begin his search for her. <br />The book is womderfully written and I felt like I got to know the main characters, to a point.

So I picked up &quot;Lincoln's Dreams&quot; hoping for the same experience.  However, I was slightly disappointed.  I thought it was a good book, but not nearly as well done as &quot;Doomsday.&quot;<br />Jeff and his employer, Mr. Broun, are working on a book about the Civil War, when Jeff meets Annie.  Annie is having these horrible dreams and doesn't know what they are about.  Since she thinks they may be about the Civil War, she goes to Mr. Broun and meets Jeff.  <br />The book is about Jeff &amp; Annie's experiences in trying to figure out what the dreams are about, while Broun is obsessed with finding out what Lincoln's dreams signify.  I thought the book was well written, and it was just the right length--not too long it was boring and not too short that a lot was left unexplained.<br />If you really like Ms. Willis' books, you will probably enjoy this one.	2002-08-01

I had heard good things about this book, so I picked it up at the library (fortunately).  However, I was maybe 20 pages in when I couldn't take it anymore and started skimming the book.  I only really read the last 30 pages or so--there seemed to be more action in those pages than in the rest of the book.<br />I WANTED to like this book, really I did.  The idea of 3 kids being born on the same day and how that influences their relationships with other people in their lives sounded cool.  Lily, Robert &amp; Warren were joined at the hip during their childhood, but I think that the amount of displeasure from various people in their formative years affected them more than anything.<br />If you are a fan of Ms. Dew's you may enjoy this book, but I don't know that I would ever pick up anything else by her.  I will say that I really liked the cover &amp; the ambiguity of the title...	2002-08-01

I did finish this book, but it was tough.  The story is pretty much based on the idea that whenever something gets tough in Jo's life, she leaves that life for a while.  She left her first husband and lived in a quasi-commune for a while.  Then that life comes back to haunt her when she meets up with an old friend, and things become strained in her current family life, so she escapes from there for a while by withdrawing into a kind of fantasy.  Her husband is patient and her kids don't even know what's going on.<br />I thought most of the characters were pretty whiny.  I liked Jo's mom, her husband Daniel, and her daughter Sadie.  I can understand where the story is coming from, because I think everyone has wanted to just escape for a while (I know I have), but the realities of life set in and you realize you really can't escape.  <br />I thought that the book was well written, I just think I was expecting something different.	2002-07-31

There is a humanness to Bathsheba and David that I didn't get out of the Biblical version.  The author portrays David as a humble man, who forgets his role as king and spiritual leader of his people to focus on his own physical desires.  This leads to chaos.  David eventually comes back to his true role as king.  <br />Bathsheba was a little girl with a dream.  She grew into a woman who was forced to marry against that dream, and then betrayed that marriage.  But after all the heartache that she had and that she caused, she came to have a relationship with God that allowed her peace of spirit.  <br />The end of the book brought tears to my eyes.  I think that everyone should read this book and learn how one action can change the destiny of an entire people.	2002-07-30

It answers the questions of who Ruth was before she married Naomi's son, and why she felt it necessary to go with Naomi, even after Orpah turned back.  <br />The situation Ruth &amp; Naomi were in during their stay in Bethlehem could not be any worse.  Gradually, the people of Bethlehem realized that although Ruth was a foreigner, she was a good and humble person who only wanted to provide for Naomi.  The love story between Boaz and Ruth is romantic, in a way.  How lucky they were to have Naomi as an intermediary.<br />Enjoy this book.  I am going to continue reading the series.	2002-07-30

I can't really explain it, other than to say that Mary wasn't necessarily likeable, and the other kids were brats.  <br />I think that Ms. Rivers took chances in narrating Jesus' life during the &quot;missing years&quot; that aren't explained in the Bible.  The healing of Anne, and the relationship with Joseph, and his brothers.  I almost felt sorry for the family after Jesus became &quot;KNOWN&quot; because he left them and didn't necessarily acknowledge them.  <br />I didn't particularly like the way the book ended--but maybe that's the Catholic in me :-)  But it was a good way to finish the series, since the other 4 books were leading up into it.<br />I would highly recommend this series.	2002-07-30

Hopefully, they will be better than this one.  Although it's good, it covers about 2 years, and with all the jumps, I had to re-read sections twice to figure out where &amp; when they were.  There are also some new characters to add to the mix.  Although this can be confusing, it's not too bad.  <br />Throughout the course of the book, we see Carpathia getting crazier, lots of plagues crammed into the last half of the book, and the potential for discovery increases.  I thought that at times, Chang was a little too cocky and could easily have been discovered.  Leah gets annoying, frankly.  Chloe gets a mission beyond the Co-op.  <br />I enjoyed this book, but the large font and big margins made the book a lot longer than it had to be. <br />I can't wait for the next one.	2002-07-29

However, I found myself skipping more and more beyond the journal entries to get back to Sierra's story.  I have been in her position--at least some of it--moving to a completely new area where you don't know anyone, and you are relying on your husband's co-workers for advice.  It's a tough situation, and I thought that Ms. Rivers brought that out well.<br />I thought the characters were well written.  You hope for a good ending, or at least one that closes everything off.  I will say that the book gives you closure, for the most part.  I did think that maybe Sierra was a little too whiny.  If she felt uncomfortable about her level of education, why didn't she go back to school?  I always got the feeling she was running from a real life.<br />Anyway, I would recommend this book, or any others by Ms. Rivers, especially her &quot;Grace&quot; series.	2002-07-27

However, the instigator of the story is Julianna and her story is not delved into.

It seems to fit, anyway--but it is a nice universal message--what would you do if you could have a &quot;do over&quot;?  <br />Miriam's story spans over 60 years, and the story is moved along by a box of items found in her estate sale.  Have kleenex nearby, as some of the emotions are so raw, you cannot help but be touched by them.

However, the shadowy forces from the first book are back to foil Adam's plans.  About the only things I didn't like about the book are the following: Juliet seems to be pretty whiny during the middle part of the book.  I understand that it makes her seem more \\"real,\\" but it's kind of annoying.  Second, the names tossed around with the Council of Twelve (Masons, Illuminati, etc.) really do nothing to advance the story.  Rather, they seem to feed into the conspiracy buffs that are against those organizations.  <br />Overall though, this is a fast reading, engaging book & I would recommend it.

Nefer is a stonemason who wants to get back into the Palace of Truth (he was raised there).  Ardent has a passion for drawing and just wants to learn more.  I liked Nefer--he seemed an to be pretty unassuming.  Ardent was a little more difficult to like.  He had this superhuman strength and endurance, and a temper that was explosive.  <br />I thought the characters were well written and that the descriptions were very vivid.  The additional plot of Mehy and his greed for power/revenge is entertaining.  <br />I would recommend this book.

However, Maria has a fondness for Richard's brother Roger.  She accepts Richard, and in my opinion, realizes over the course of the book that Roger would not have been a good match.  <br />The story is of their life together, with all its pitfalls and problems.  One thing that was prevalent is the amount of abuse Maria takes.  It may be shocking to some readers.  Also, I liked how no one was really the &quot;bad&quot; guy or the &quot;good&quot; guy...they were just human.  Maria may have had her faults, but you knew what they were and learned to deal with them.  However, some things were just mentioned, and that was it--like Maria's tapestry work.  It's mentioned a few times, but never goes anywhere--kinda makes you wonder why it was mentioned in the first place.  <br />There were sections of this book that were wonderful and fast to read, and there were sections that I just skimmed.  However, the latter were far fewer than the former.  <br />Enjoy this book.	2002-07-22

I understand why it was done, but you don't know who the narrator is until a few pages in.  However, once you get used to the fact that Tegid is narrating, it's a deep read with rich descriptions and an activity that bounces you all over, which can be distracting.<br />It's an interesting book about the right of kings and of sovereignty.  What exactly does a king mean to the people, the land or to himself?  I think that this is a question that bothers Llew throughout the book.  The answer isn't clearly defined, and you see the destined king stumble, but the pondering of the question is a valuable task.<br />That said, I would say that there is a lack of depth to the plot.  You know that everything is supposed to come out right at the end.  Things that should be difficult to accomplish are dispatched with ease.  However, I enjoyed this book and will pick up the 3rd book in the series to finish it off.	2002-07-22

Tarik is so entertaining.  The author leaves some things hidden until the very end, which makes it a satisfying conclusion.  <br />However, there were parts of this book that just drug along.  The romance was ok, but the whole \\"who is he?\\" \\"who is she?\\" nonsense against a larger backdrop was inconsequential.  <br />All in all, I think this is a good book that deserves a read, however, be prepared to have to dig through some not very exciting parts to get to the good stuff.	2002-07-18

I would have liked a little more resolution at the end, but I think that some of the characters had moved much further along in their lives by the end of the book.<br />The book opens in 1941 and centers on the lives of the 3 Hayes daughters. Cameron is following her father's footsteps into Journalism.  Blair is trying to find her place in the world but not settling on anything.  Jackie is the youngest, and is completing college.  All three girls face their problems in this book--some of them are more serious than others, but all have far-reaching consequences.  <br />The book ends in December 1941, with a letter dated December 7th.  I wonder if this leaves the series open for 5 more books--one for each year of the war, and then a follow-up???	2002-07-15

The characters are interesting--everyone has a different outlook on life.  Gareth is the narrator.  He starts out as a serf in Ireland, and due to a curse, is sent to work for Trystan in Britian.  However, Trystan manages to get himself banished from Britain, and then sends for Gareth to come to Amorica.  By this time, Gareth is a lord in his own right, and companion of King Arthur.  <br />The Arthurian legend is often mentioned in conjunction with this book.  And although Arthur & Gwenevere play a role in the book, they aren't the main focus.  Gwen & Lancelot are only mentioned once, and even then it is in passing. Arthur plays the larger role because he is commander of the troops of which Gareth & Trystan are members.  <br />I liked the people in the book, and I thought that Ms. Hawks did a good job bringing them to life.  Be warned--this book can be rather depressing.  It is full of lost loves, curses, death and people just trying to survive.  <br />Enjoy!	2002-07-12

There are 5 sides of serviceman relationships here.  First is a story about a returning vet, who has to deal with survivor guilt. Second is a story about a man stranded who thinks that his girl may have found someone else AND a man back home who has somehow never been drafted.  Third is the story about the impulsive marriage that leaves a young woman alone to give birth to their child.  Lastly is a story about two people who put off getting married until they finally decided the war was too great a risk not to get married.  <br />I enjoyed each of the stories, but the relationships were left hanging.  You don't really know what happened--did everyone make it back alive?  The only story you get some kind of closure on is the first one, and only then because you are able to pick up the clues in other stories.<br />All in all, it's a good book, but I wouldn't buy it---I would borrow it from the library.	2002-07-11

This is a love story--the possibility of love between Salmon &amp; Rahab and the love Rahab has for a God she has never seen.  Rahab has a faith in God that is strong, even though she may not know the Law of God, she knows the intentions.  <br />This series brings to life the dynamic stories of the women of the bible.

The descriptions of events that happened are very vivid in this book.  This book is light on action, and heavy on the introspective ramblings of Paul Brenner (from \\"General's Daughter\\").  <br />Paul is accompanied by Susan Weber who knows more than she lets on.  This is a problem because you never truly knows where she stands.  They are faced with having their privacy invaded and being hounded at every turn by Col. Mang, who seems to have it out for Paul.  <br />Many things are left unresolved in this book, which I suppose is good if you are looking to write a sequel.  But it would have been nice to have it all tied up at the end.  I kept waiting for something to happen in this book.  Everyonce in a while someone would be killed, or they would find a clue.  But it isn't until the last 50-75 pages that things are kicked into high gear. <br />An enjoyable read, but not one that kept me glued to my chair.	2002-07-10

This is a good book about adoption, infertility, broken homes, and how God can help people in their lives.  I found the book very emotional.  The characters, although not very deep, seem to resonate with a purpose.  You don't get to know any of the characters VERY well, but you get an understanding of what Tess &amp; Sherry have gone through.  <br />After all the despair, there is light at the end of the tunnel with this book, as the author places a nice little epilogue at the end...	2002-07-10

Rebekah is someone I never really thought a whole lot about--other than I knew that she had tricked Isaac.  This brings a new layer to her story. I agree that after the mother showed up, some things seemed phony, but I thought that Card did a good job of showing a family that has to deal with disabilities.  First Rebekah's father is deaf, then Abraham's sourness &amp; personality, and then Isaac's blindness.  <br />Comparing this to the story of &quot;Sarah&quot; which I also liked, I think that many things are similar.  Maybe that was the point in this book--many times it is remarked how similar Sarah &amp; Rebekah were in dealing with Abraham and their families.  I know that women in the time period didn't have much in the way of independence, but I would like to hope that some men allowed their wives to be free thinkers, and to have some independence.  <br />I thought that Rebekah was just a little TOO perfect.  She flies off the handle, and then after a few hours of thinking about her actions, is all sweetness and forgiving, and asks for forgiveness.  Most people I know aren't that easy to get along with.  <br />All in all, I thought this was a good book, and I can't wait to see who he writes about next.	2002-07-03

I thought that it was very refreshing.  Most of the Arthur accounts are told differently, but this is from the viewpoint of Merlin's daughter, a voice not previously heard.  As such, I think that's part of the appeal.  Obviously, the major themes in the story--sword in the stone, Gwenevere &amp; Lancelot's betrayal, and Merlin's advice are the same.  It's just the perspective has changed.<br />Wren grew up with Arthur, Lancelot, Cai and the other Companions.  They were her friends as she was traveling the length &amp; breadth of Britain with her father.  Soon, she was taken to Avalon to train as a priestess. However, the needs of the outerworld summoned her and she left Avalon to assist the Merlin.  She comes to face her love of Arthur, the forced marriage to Carradoc, and betrayal by those closest to her father and Arthur.  She also grows into her own role of advisor and mistress of her own household. <br />Keep an open mind and be ready for the differences that await.	2002-07-02

I can see how it would have been difficult to turn a musical/stage production into a novel, but the author succeeded.  One of the things I had to get used to was having Moses during the reign of Hapseptsut and Tutmosis, instead of Ramses, but Card's explanation of this does have some merit.  Also, although I knew that Moses stammered, I had to get used to how Card portrayed that in the book with the elipses.   But that was an effective way of pointing out when he stammered and when he didn't.<br />The supporting characters were well written.  They each had their specific traits, and even I felt like smacking Aaron &amp; Miriam around sometimes because they were just a little too full of themselves.  Zeforah and her sisters were a lot of fun to read about.  <br />I think that this is a wonderful book.	2002-07-01

I know that many of the supporting characters are fictional, but everything taken in context adds so much more depth than we usually read.  I thought it was interesting how Joseph, Tuya, Sagira, and the pharaohs all had lives that intertwined at various points.  <br />This book has loves stories, murderous plots, and forgiveness.  I liked how the interplay of the different religions came into focus with Tutmosis.  It was different, reading about a Pharaoh as a human being.  <br />I can't wait to read the next book in the series.	2002-06-30

However, this book was a struggle.  I ended up skipping over a lot of the battle scenes just so that I could get through it. <br />Ainvar is an orphan who is taken in by the chief Druid and instructed in their ways.  His friend, Rix, is a warrior.  Throughout their lives, they are the opposite sides of the same coin.  Ainvar comes to give Rix advice throughout the book.<br />This is a story of the conquering of Gaul by Caesar, and the decline of the Druids.  I like Ainvar for the most part, but there were times where he was just a little too whiny.  The women's roles in this book are varied.  Some of them seem strong to begin with, but then they change.  By the end of the book, you are just hoping that things don't end too depressingly.  <br />I am glad I didn't buy this book &amp; only got it from the library.  It was good, but probably not worth the money.	2002-06-28

I loved her previous books \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" and \\"The Last Time They Met,\\" but this just didn't seem to have the same depth.

The detail that Ms. Willis puts into her writing is astounding.  I was impressed with the depth of the characters.  <br />Kirvin is a history major at Oxford.  She wants to go back to 1320 to &quot;research&quot; how people lived.  Against the advise of some of her professors, she deeply prepares for her role--even giving herself a head injury to fit her cover story, and then she steps into the net.  <br />After she leaves, an unknown virus breaks out at Oxford.  As the doctors and professors battle to save people's lives, the stories of these people are woven together with those of the time period Kirvin has traveled to.  Nothing is as it seems.  She was expecting to be able to follow her plan to completion, but it veers off course when she becomes deathly ill.  She realizes then that the people who have taken her in are not just like the people in a text book or even a period novel--they are real people with real, everyday problems and feelings.  <br />I don't want to give away anything, but this book is worth a read.  Some parts move slowly, but it does pick up at the end.  If you pay attention, you can figure the mystery out before everyone else does.  I would recommend this book to everyone.  I just wish there was a sequel.	2002-06-26

This is also the story of Leah, one of the early Christians; the story of Hannah, an archealogist; and the story of Ari &amp; Rachel, Hannah's daughter.  These are women with brave love stories and historical elements that withstand the test of time.  <br />Abby has just been rocked by the betrayal of her husband's infidelity.  She tries to escape from it all by going to Israel.  There she meets Hannah and Ari.  But as in everything, not all is as it seems.  <br />Ms. Austin weaves the historical stories throughout the narrative very well.  The reader is pulled into every story.  I found myself tearing up at various points because the stories were so moving.  <br />This is a novel about forgiveness and the lesson that you can't run from your pain--you have to face it.  And the characters in the story face their own pain and learn to live again.	2002-06-26

It had been a while since I read the other two books in the series, so I had to re-figure out all the characters.  I like the variety of characters in the book.  Each new character adds something to the mix.  However, some characters are ignored after the first section, which is odd--because they could figure into the rest of the book.  <br />Some of the very enjoyable characters in this book are Marji, Mitchell & Davis (the cowboys), Ellie (the chimp), Glinda, and the fairy.  The usual characters are still interesting, but I felt like the whole \\"who does he really love\\" thing was getting old after a while.  <br />All the characters come to face their greatest fears.  Grace finds out who her parents really are (now THAT'S a plot twist I didn't see coming).  Travis still has to figure out where he belongs, but at least he is not as wimpy in this book as in others.  Aryn has many things to figure out in this book, and it isn't quite known if she does figure them out.  <br />This book is about defeating evil, in its many forms.  Duratek and the Seekers play prominently in this book.  Some interesting clues are given throughout the book to lead readers to other things.  I call this book a placeholder because while it does advance the series, it still seems that there is something larger on the horizon, and this is just a prelude.  <br />I would recommend this book.	2002-06-20

Although you may not get to know the characters Paul & Laura very well, you feel like you can know their struggle. Although it is interesting that throughout the book, there is usually one experience that is horrible for the couple, and then success, or something good happens. There was just something pollyanna-ish about the entire novel. That's not to say that it wasn't a good read, just be prepared.<br />I think that there were things that good have been handled better. For instance, Vicki's story is boiled down into one small paragraph with little build up. Dialogue could have been better--not as stilted. <br />All in all, I think this is a good book that deserves to be read by people trying to understand couples battling with infertility.	2002-06-20

Mina is a professor who has just been forced to retire after 41 years as a music teacher at a college.  Fate brings them together and forces them to acknowledge their own shortcomings and accept their faith in God's methods.  Mina forces Mike to look to God for the answers and Mike forces Mina to actually live.  <br />The story has wonderful characters--especially the grandkids.

Even at the end, you are still left wondering what will happen in the future.  Peyton is a reporter on a deadline.  She has 3 weeks to get her column straightened up or she is going to be forced to go back to news.  There is a plane crash, and as fate would have it, Peyton is given a note from a passenger that washed up on the beach.  She is then on a crusade to find who the note truly belongs to.  <br />Along this journey, she tries to ignore her past, but when she meets the person the note is meant for, she cannot ignore what happened to her so many years ago.  The proverbial tidal wave rushes over her, and she is forced to examine what she has considered the truth of her life.  <br />This ending of the book leaves it open for a sequel.  If one is ever written, you can be sure that I would pick it up.  This is a tale that allows everyone to reflect on what they would do if they had only a few moments left to live.  <br />I would recommend this book to everyone.	2002-06-13

We also finish the story of Kathleen O'Connor, who has been doing the research on the descendants of Cahira.  She is in Ireland for the wedding of her best friend Taylor and his fiancee (whom she introduced) Maddie.  <br />This book describes the journey of Kathleen's faith, and how she comes to rely on herself for her own happiness.  She realizes her own role in the Cahira tradition is not to chronicle the stories, or to take up arms to fight, but to live.  She finds her own way in Ireland, and the ending of the book brings everything full circle and to a satisfying conclusion.	2002-06-13

Jaenelle is so fragile, it just breaks your heart to see what she has gone through in her life.  Sadi has this hard exterior, but underneath is caring.  <br />I guess I can't say enough good things about this book.

Ms. Hunt does a great job of bring the people and places to life.  Jocelyn is a young woman who is forced to go to America with her uncle & cousin's family.  Her father forces her to go because he does not want her to watch him die.  Thomas is a preacher who is going on the voyage to get away from his life.  However, the only way he can go is to agree to either marry Jocelyn or spend 15 years as an indentured servant to Jocelyn's uncle.  <br />Thomas & Jocelyn meet on board and they get married on board.  However, Jocelyn has a tendency to misread Thomas' feelings and words throughout the book.  This leads to some heartbreaking moments on both character's parts.  You just think \\"If they would only just sit down and talk it out\\" but it never happens the way you want it to.<br />The book follows the adventures of the colonists to Raleigh and offers a view into why they may have disappeared.  There are the inevitable fights about religion and interaction with the Indians, and how to get word to England.  One thing I liked about this book was how the characters were portrayed.  I saw the characters change from their time in England to once they were settled in America.  It seemed that even the common people got a new voice in a new land.  <br />The love story between Thomas & Jocelyn is touching and frustrating.  Expect to be in tears at various times throughout the book.  On to book 2 in the series.	2002-06-11

You can tell that Mr. Lawhead researched the topic extensively and brings his active imagination to life with this book. The descriptions are wonderful, and the characters about leap from the page. There is a little bit of everything in this book to suit different readers--intrigue, romance, fantasy, history--truly a wellrounded book. <br />I can't wait to read book 2.	2002-06-11

This is basically the story of a woman at a crossroads.  Sidda has had her words used against her in a NY Times article and her mother (Vivi) is ticked.  Due to the reaction of her mother, Sidda puts her wedding on hold and takes off to figure her mom out--and to understand herself a little better. <br />The book is filled with stories--some are happy, some are not pleasant at all.  The reader must keep in mind that the families in the book are atypical.  There are unpleasantries in everyone's life that must be examined.  Sometimes, the best way to examine them is upclose with the bare facts.  <br />Vivi loans Sidda her scrapbook &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.&quot;  Vivi also allows her friends to speak to Sidda about the past.  Through the scrapbook and the Ya-Yas, we learn why Vivi is the kind of mother she turned out to be.  We also learn how the bonds of friendship are strengthened by shared dispair, trauma and life experiences.  <br />I wish everyone friendships like the Ya-Yas, and I recommend this book to everyone.	2002-06-06

I liked how Rebecca came to a realization in her life that maybe she wasn't who she thought she was.  Maybe her entire reality at this point in her life was based on a fiction?  This book explores both her reality and her fiction. In this book, the author allows all the questions people have about their existence come to the front to be dealt with--maybe not answered, but at least dealt with.  <br />Major drawbacks in the book for me were the people's names.  They were just a little too much.  About the only people I could keep track of were the kids.  I thought about keeping them straight on paper, but the book is too short for that. <br />This is a good book, and I look forward to reading more books by Ms. Tyler.	2002-06-04

Now, what if the terrorists wouldn't let you go, and you were there for months on end, with only the other hostages and the terrorists for company?<br />This book asks those questions, and although it is an unlikely situation, gives the reader some answers.  The hostages are bound together by their circumstances--languages must be overcome, music is enjoyed, and the destiny of a group of people is changed...<br />This book exemplifies the notion that music is the universal language.  The characters I liked best were Gen, Roxane, Messner, and Hosokawa.  Gen & Messner were trying to do the best they could in their situations.  Gen was forced to be translator for the entire group. Messner was in the unfortunate position of Red Cross representative, and negotiator with the terrorists.  I think that both of them knew that the hostage situation was going to end badly, and that it just couldn't continue.  Roxane & Hosokawa were my favorites because they both brought something to the story.  Hosokawa grew during the course of the book--his life totally changed.  Once he overcame the guilt of the party being in his honor, he dedicated himself to making the best of the situation.  Roxane, although she didn't grow as a character, I think that she learned a patience and an appreciation that she didn't have before.<br />Read this book--maybe you will also learn some life lessons.	2002-06-03

In this story, things just seem to fall into Thomas' lap.  He really is just too good to be true.  Thomas acknowledges to himself that he promises things too easily, and that is his problem throughout the book.  That, and the fact that it is hard for him to follow through on those promises.<br />I liked how the reader doesn't find out until after the massacre who Thomas' father is.  I liked how Thomas wised up to Jeannette and realized she really was a conniving social climber.  I liked how Sir Guillaume's relationship with Eleanor was simple and true, and not distorted by class.  Most of all, I liked this book because I was constantly being surprised by new information.  <br />You can read history, and you can read fiction.  If you choose to read historical fiction, know that information is going to be played with to suit the plot.  Personally, I thought that the author did a good job in presenting the battles--chivalry has no place in battle.  I thought that he did a good job presenting the characters--you have all types in this book, which makes it enjoyable.  <br />I would recommend this book.	2002-05-31

This novel is about Alice & Howard Goodwin, but it is mainly told through Alice's eyes.  The novel starts off happily enough--you immediately get the feeling that Alice is a free spirit who says and does things without thinking.  However, quickly the novel hits tragedy and it never fully recovers.  The majority of the novel deals with everyone's reactions to the the tragedies in Alice & Howard's life.  <br />I got the feeling that none of the other characters understood Alice, and maybe that was the author's intent--to make her out to be someone noone would understand so as to better illustrate her isolation when she goes to jail.  I also got the feeling that there wasn't any real substance to the marriages portrayed.  Howard and Alice seemed to have gotten married because Alice got pregnant, but they didn't have anything in common.  Theresa and Dan seemed to love eachother, but after Lizzy's death, it took a major event to get them even talking again.<br />One thing I thought was really interesting was that when Howard brought the girls to see Alice in jail, that there were two completely different stories about what happened that day--pay attention to that--it illustrates their completely different temperments and outlooks on life.  <br />I think this is a WAY better book than \\"Book of Ruth\\" which I couldn't read.  But don't read this book looking for accurate portrayals of life on a farm, or life as a school nurse.	2002-05-30

His dog died, he's in and out of jail, he was abused as a child, he can't control his anger, and to top it all off, he's alone with out a family.  Then something good actually happens---he gets shot by the husband of the woman he has been fooling around with.  Now, in everyday life, that might not be a good thing, but in Hayden's case it is.  He is forced to re-examine his life and what led him to this point.  <br />This book is grim, but I got the feeling that Hayden had a heart.  He always felt bad about what he did, and just seemed to want to rescue things (animals, people, etc.)  Those actions may have caused more trouble, but he wanted to help.  <br />If you think about it, it's kind of amazing how something you do today can change the rest of your life, and if you look back you can almost pinpoint that moment when your life changed.  <br />This book's ending is relatively weak, but it wraps up the story and gives you some hope that Hayden's life will be better.<br />I would recommend this book.	2002-05-29

For some reason, this was that kind of book for me.  I don't know why--the plot was tame, the characters weren't all that deep--but what was there was intense.  <br />Dana is the guardian of her two nieces after their mother and father die in a boating accident.  Quinn, the oldest, has some issues.  I guess she was the character that I most related to.  Allie is the younger of the two and she is the more needy.  She needs constant reassurance that she is loved and that no one is going to leave her.  <br />Dana and her sister Lily were extremely close.  When they were younger, they ran a sailing school.  At that school, they saved the life of a young boy named Sam.  Sam vowed to protect them as long as he lived.  Now he is drawn to Dana.  This relationship was plausible, if a little unbalanced.  Dana didn't want the relationship and it seemed like Sam was pushing her...<br />I kept waiting for the plot to get really mysterious and have some big scandal with the death of Lily and her husband.  There is a mystery, but it is pretty minor.  The book is mainly about how Dana deals with the parenting of two young children, and their recovery from their parents' deaths.  <br />If you need a break from intense/serious reading, this is the book.	2002-05-27

I picked up this book, hoping that there would me some truth to it.  While I am sure that the majority of the events DID happen, they way they are presented leaves much to be desired.  I got the impression reading this book that there was yet a 3rd side to the story that is not presented here. <br />This is the story of the family, as told by Maria.  This is the book on which the movie is based.  The book leads the reader to believe that everything was sunshine and roses and that whenever anything bad happened, God provided the opportunities.  While I am not doubting Maria's faith, I also think that she worked her tail off to get some of the opportunites the family recieved.  <br />This book is very moving.  Some of the antics of the little kids made me chuckle and the story of Georg's death brought tears to my eyes.  I would be interested in finding out what happened later.....<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the movie.	2002-05-24

It's been a while since I read the first two books in this series, and I was surprised that it was so easy for me to pick up right where they left off.  <br />This is the story of Nicole's journey to England to take her place as the heir to her Uncle Charles.  Her ideas of duty and responsibility, but also her need for change and to find her own place in the world are at the heart of the novel.  <br />I don't want to give away too much of the plot--especially the surprise ending, but needless to say, this book will keep you charmed through the end--through all the heartache, sorrow and joy that comes through in colonial America.	2002-05-24

This book is moving...I thought that it brought a new eye to the Civil War. Flanna is in Boston, studying to get her medical degree so that she can return to Charleston and help her father in his practice.  However, the Civil War breaks out and Flanna is forced to figure out how she will get home.  As in the other  Cahira O'Connor books, she dresses as a boy and becomes a soldier.  <br />I thought this book was very well written from beginning to end.  The death of the professor is Kathleen's impetus to get back to work on the story of the heirs of Cahira O'Connor.  What she finds leads her to wonder what HER role in this will be.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone, but please read the other 2 books in the series first.  This book will make you want to rush out and pick up the 4th.	2002-05-22

I was looking for a break from Goodkind and Jordan, adn thought that this book sounded interesting.  I was not disappointed.<br />Connavar grows up in the shadow of his father's alleged cowardice, but with a stepfather who loves him dearly.  Among his people, Conn is the only one who seems interested in finding out about the rest of the peoples around them.  This curiosity sets off a series of events that determine the rest of the story.  He is faced with troubles that impact his entire people.  Luckily, he seems to be blessed by the gods.<br />Conn must also face the beast inside of him---his ability for blinding anger and rage...a thirst for vengeance.  <br />This was a wonderful story and I recommend it to anyone.  I will be looking for the next book.	2002-05-21

Although it is billed as Christian fiction, compared with other Christian  fiction books, there is not much of the spiritual aspect--bible verses, etc.  This is Christian on the idea of WHO we are, and how our better nature can be brought out.  <br />The idea of a blood/DNA transfer to bring about genetic engineering is pretty current; although I will agree with another reviewer that at times the technical aspects of the book were just too heavy.  And it's hard to write a book with a lot of technology in it because it is dated so quickly.<br />The characters were pretty well written.  I loved the baboon, Freddy; and thought that Katherine's trials were well written and believeable.  <br />I would recommend this book.	2002-05-20

The characters all come to realize that life is best lived with someone who truly cares about you and your independence.  Not having read the other two books in the trilogy, I didn't know all the background.  However, I don't think that hindered my understanding of the plot and the characters.  <br />The characters are well written and for the most part, very likeable.  The only thing that bothered me was that at times, the timing of the book seemed off.  I never really knew what events were happening in the past, and somethings seemed to be skipped over.  For instance, this big secret was going to be revealed, and the author cut to a different story line;  when the first story line is picked back up--the secret isn't told--you only get their reaction.  Parts of the book just seemed jumpy.  <br />I would recommend this book--either on its own or as the last book in the series.	2002-05-20

Ken fights battles throughout the novel--with himself, with fellow officers in the Japanese Army Air Corps, with ordinary citizens as a victim of mistaken identity.  Ken, although he has been raised in Japan for the majority of his life has Caucasian facial features.  <br />The book is extremely well written.  I found the relationships within the family to be extremely diverse.  There was a focus on the father and mother, but not so much on the children (except for Ken).  The diferent personalities of Ken's friends were each part of a larger picture--there were the fanatics, the artists and the ones who just wanted to survive.  It was a good presentation of what makes up a nation during war.<br />The first part of the book is about Saburo (the father) and his diplomatic efforts in the United States right before Pearl Harbor.  I found this part to be particualary interesting, as it has been a matter of debate for the last several years. The issue of how much Roosevelt knew before December 7 rings especially true now.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  It will hold your attention for days...	2002-05-18

There were some sections that I felt like I was plodding through because it was SO very dry, but all in all, this is a book that gives a long hard look at Alice's life.  It made me understand where HRH Prince Philip gets his sense of humor (from his father, I think).  Also, the way the children were brought up (especially Philip) was interesting to read.  I think that, had Alice lived during the present time, her illness and treatment would have been different.<br />I found the family trees in the back of the book useful.  It was hard to keep track of everyone's real name and then their titles and nicknames and then if they were married.  I should have had a notebook next to me while I read this book.  <br />I always knew that Queen Victoria's progeny were all over Europe, but this book really struck that fact home with me.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.	2002-05-16

Cath is willed her grandmother's house and goes to stay there to figure her life out after 2 divorces and a general feeling of blah.  While there, she finds her grandmother's (Georgia) diaries and reads them.  She knew that her life was similar to her grandmother's but I don't think she realized how similar.  Both of their mothers died while they were teens; both of them were sent away--Cath to her grandparent's house, Georgia to the sanitarium; both of them had troubled marriages.<br />One thing I would suggest to everyone who reads this book is to pay attention to the diary entries.  There is something eerie, in my view, with the way the weather is described.  I don't know if it is really the weather, or if Georgia was commenting on something else.  <br />It is interesting to realize how misconceptions about what someone is saying and going through can drastically affect your life.  This is a main theme behind this novel.<br />I would recommend it to anyone.	2002-05-10

Aidan O'Connor seeks to escape her life in the slums by using her art.  Her patron sees her talent and seeks to have it brought to the light of day.  <br />The characters are rich and well rounded.  The conversions and realizations of self are truly well written and believable.  Personally, I like how the beginning and end of every book begins with Kathleen setting up the story, and then giving a postscript.  <br />This is a wonderful book that can bring to life an entirely new world.	2002-05-10

The way that it is written allows the reader to once again experience the harshness of frontier life in the Yukon.  The characters, although not exceedingly &quot;deep,&quot; offer the reader the opportunity to see through their eyes.  <br />The story is the final book in the Yukon Quest trilogy.  While you don't have to read the other two books to understand this one, I would highly recommend it.  This book ties up all the loose endings and gives everyone the ending they need/deserve.  <br />Although the sprituality of the characters doesn't play as large a part in this book as the other two, it still is present.  I would say that this one is less &quot;preachy,&quot; bit in a good way.  The mentionings of sprituality are less, but the ones that are mentioned mean more in the context of the book and the story line.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  But read the first two books before picking this one up.	2002-05-09

It is what every &quot;Sound of Music&quot; fan should read, if they are at all interested in how the movie got made.  The behind-the-scenes stories are wonderful.  What I thought was interesting was who was considered for the leads--can you imagine Sean Connery as the Captain??? ack! Or Walter Matthau as Max?  To think that the best cast came in at just the right time and that it produced one of the best loved musicals of all time.  If one thing had been off, think of what a different movie would have been made.<br />I was especially interested in reading the sections on the REAL von Trapp family and their story.  Maria really was a powerhouse in keeping her family the way she wanted it.  The pictures were beautiful and the background material (sketches, notes, etc.) were wonderful to see. <br />A must read for any &quot;Sound of Music&quot; fan.	2002-05-09

By halfway through, I was tired of the same plot being rehashed with different names.  Young girl who has something bad happen to her so that she will never be able to be married, enters the theatre world, is discovered by someone who wants to keep her...he can't offer enough money so she moves up to someone even richer...somewhere along the line she gets the title \\"courtesan.\\"  But not everyone is a courtesan--there are actual requirements.  <br />This book is good, don't get me wrong, but it seemed like I was reading the same story over and over, and sometimes, the author told the SAME story over and over.  The writing, although not scholarly, per se, is readable.  As another reviewer stated, I would have like footnotes, or end of chapter notes to let me know where she got her information.  Also, the book was put together well, except I didn't really understand the point of the \\"erotic stations\\" that seemed to be at the end of every chapter.  What were their purpose?<br />I would recommend this book if you just want an overview of the life of a courtesan.  It is well written.	2002-05-08

I was happy to find out that it was very well presented--every two pages is a new topic, and it is laid out with pictures, graphs, and personal recollections which make it easy to grasp.  The book is laid out chronologically, which makes it easy to follow, and the language isn't difficult to understand.  <br />Mr. Gilbert's grasp of history and what makes history accessible is discovered during the reading of this book.  He seems to know that, with this topic especially, the use of personal stories personifies the experience for the reader.  <br />A very good book, and I would recommend it to anyone.	2002-05-07

Normally, I don't like first person narrative, but this book was wonderfully written.  The story of Artemisia is one of betrayal and passion, and the slow realization that reality isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  She is forced, by circumstance, to be married to someone she doesn't know.  HE can't accept that she is a better painter than he.  Artemisia spends the majority of her life trying to reconcile her past to her present and to find a balance between her love of painting and the love of her family.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  Not only does it illustrate a period in history that I don't know much about, but it allows the reader to see behind the paintings.  The pursuit of art, for art's sake, is a noble venture, and to see the background makes it even more important.	2002-05-07

Anika burns with the thought of revenge against those who have wronged her.  As such, she decides to dress as a boy and earn a knighthood.  Sir John takes her into his household to learn to be a knight and to serve him as long as he serves the teachings of Jan Huss.  <br />This is a story of not only a young girl fighting for what she believes, but also the history of the church during the 1400s, which was rife with corruption.  Jan Huss preached against the things that were wrong in the Church.<br />The premise to the series is that there are women descended from Cahira O'Connor who rise up to fight against injustice.  It should be interesting to read the next 3 books in the series.	2002-05-06

Despite all of their hardships, the faith of the characters is deepened and strengthened.  <br />These books may be formulaic, but Ms. Peterson writes very well, so the formula isn't noticed as much.

This is the story of a love that brought down a king.<br />Emerald is the unfortunate child.  Although Wallis believes her dead (in a freak storm), Emerald lives her life trying to find out who she really is.  She is manipulated by the adults around her, adn runs away to become a model in Paris.  She is successful, but runs into Wallis Simpson--who is shocked that her daughter is alive.  Although there is never a touching Mother-Daughter reunion, I got the feeling that maybe in the back of her mind Wallis loved Emerald.<br />That being said, I loved this book.  The characters, although they were loosely based in reality, became clear to me.  The Duke &amp; Duchess are portrayed as whiny, self-indulgent people who can't see anything beyond their own wants, but of the two the Duke is marginally more tolerable than Wallis.  I don't know how accurate the portrayals are, but you can tell the book was well researched.<br />This is a good read and is highly recommended.	2002-01-08

This book pulled me in from the beginning.  At first I didn't think I could get into it because it jumped from first person to third person, but the story helps navigate those leaps.  I enjoyed seeing history though Asher's eyes, and the doubt become certainty in Claudia's.  <br />This is an entrancing story of Asher, who wanders the Earth from the time of Christ.  He believes his mission is to find the Antichrist in every generation and to bring him to God so that mankind has that much longer to live.  Along the way, he meets many famous/notorious people, and he writes about them in his journals.  Claudia is a jury consultant in New York who is approached with an offer to work for a new company in Italy that is focused on world peace.  She meets and hires Asher and they get to know each other.  <br />I thought that Ms. Hunt did a wonderful. I couldn't help but wonder after I finished the book if there couldn't be a sequel.  The ending is left deliciously vague.  I would highly recommend this book.	2001-11-27

I felt like I really got to know the characters of Louisa and Catherine.  Even though their own society's didn't agree with each other at the time, they were the one shining beacon of hope between the two.  Their families had to overcome their prejudice in order to see the benefits of this relationship.  Through it all, the young ladies taught eachother the value of friendship, a belief in God and that even one person can make a difference.  <br />I would very much recommend this book to anyone.	2001-11-22

I was familiar with the Abraham/Sarah story from long ago, but the depth that Mr. Card gives to these characters in this novel truly brings them to life in the mind's eye.  Abraham is shown by his faith in God and how it never wavers.  Sarah, with all the insecurity of being new to Abraham's faith, often wonders if she made the right decisions or if she is being punished for disobeying her father's wishes.  Sarah's relationships with her sister and Hagar show how outward appearances often mask what is really going on.  Hagar seemed to be Sarah's friend, but that masked the true feelings of hatred because of the master/slave relationship.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone, and can't wait until I can get my hands on &quot;Rebekah.&quot;	2001-11-22

The main constants are Emma, Grace and Suzanne, who are packing Emma's belongings to move her into a new home.  Through the move, by finding items, the bits of the past come out.  Suzanne runs with these bits, obsessed with putting the complete picture together.  Through this, she learns of her great-grandmother Louise, who left Germany with her husband, because he wanted to avoid serving in WW1; she learns of Emma, who lived an unconventional life due to her choices, and she learns of her mother Grace, whose crusade for her real father gives her 5 fathers and a faith in God that is constant.  Suzanne also tells her story of a youthful passion that waned and led to the beginnings of her divorce.  <br />Throughout, the role of wives plays a huge part.  Louise left all that she knew because her father forced her to leave to join her husband in America.  Emma, seeing the role her mother played in her house, determined that she was going to be different.  After multiple tragedies in the family, she gave in and tried to follow her mother's role, but did not succeed.  Grace, seeing the way her mother was treated, gave up her career to marry Steven and run the house.  Suzanne, seeing her parent's relationship, vows to be different.  <br />The stories in this book are powerful.  The underlying mystery is solved by the end of the book.  After the answer is revealed, the reader then can understand the clues left throughout the book.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  A great story!	2001-11-21

Margaret &amp; Davis don't talk to each other, Hilda goes through live pushing everyone away, and not saying the things that are important, Danielle &amp; Osman drift along until Danielle gets sick, and then no one talks about her being sick.  Sophie has to struggle through live without a mother and trying to bring her father back to life.  <br />It's depressing because just when you think life is turning around for the characters, someone dies.  Some of the deaths are romanticized, but it doesn't quite erase the fact that the person is dead.  <br />THe writing on the book jacket sounded interesting--maybe they were trying to relate the title to the novel itself.  I can understand why some people are drawn to stay in one place and others aren't, but that really only affects the first part of the book.  Davis stays in Regina because he falls in love with Margaret, Hilda moves to Toronto to escape after her parents' death, Danielle is forced by her mom to move to Paris to protect her from men, and Sophie is forced to move to New York with her family to escape memories of her mom.  <br />The book is good, and if you want something quick to read, then maybe this is it, but you probably got most of the plot from this review.  It's a good book, just extremely dry.	2001-11-21

The idea of searching for Noah's Ark and the Garden of Eden fascinated me.  This book IS interesting in those respects.  Adam Livingstone and his team race to find the ark and Eden, despite the best attempts of some huge conspiracy to dissuade them from their search.  Along the way, Adam rediscovers his faith, which in turn, directly influences their search.  The author does do a good job of providing drawings in the book to aid the reader.<br />However, there are a few things that bugged me about this book.  First is that it is SOOOOO slow at times.  It took me 3 weeks of reading this book around others to actually get through it, and even then, I was skimming some pages.  I like Adam and Juliet and the team, but some things seemed really improbable. Second, I don't mind conspiracy driven plots, but it seemed like the author took something he knows very little about (Masonic orders/Scottish Rite) and made that the basis of his conspiracy.  Constant references are made to the Lodge and initiations, etc. that don't advance the plot, and in fact, the whole Masonic connection doesn't advance the plot or the conspiracy.  Not to say that it does nothing but feed into the misconceptions that already exist about Masons.  And then there's the council of twelve, who have these demon visitors, and when the council goes into a trance, the demons talk and plan.  However, whenever someone is praying for Adam or a member of the team, the council of twelve are blocked from hurting (at times even seeing) the person.  <br />All this said, I will probably read the sequel to this book because there are some loose ends.  But I can't say that I highly recommend this book.  I can recommend it to someone who is somewhat interested in biblical archaeology and wants a story about that.	2001-11-20

I found the characters of Daniel &amp; Lyna well written and personable.  Even Marian and Leo were well written.  Leo is written so dispicable that you want to just slap him around a few times.  I like how historical people and facts are written into the book, but I agree with another reviewer that some of the descriptions of George 2 &amp; 3 are just plain wrong.  The phrase &quot;the angels of England wept when George 3 ascended the throne&quot; doesn't fit the book or the situation.  <br />However, I do think the author did a good job in portraying how the war in the colonies pitted families against friends and split families between Tory and Colonist.  <br />I would recommend this book.	2001-11-20

This book isn't really a sequel to the other 2 books in this series.  The main character is not featured in book 2, and the only character from book 2, is Gwen Carson, who had a small part in book 2.  That being said, I thought this book was great.  Jillian takes over for her twin, Judith, at her job in an Arizona Harvey Restaurant.  The novel follows her as she struggles to find her faith, and to reconcile her love and respect for her parents with her growing sense of independence. She also seeks to find her place in the world.<br />Ms. Peterson is able to bring to live the struggle between the white man and the Indians in the late 1800s.  By using Jillian to act as conscience for the community, she allows Jillian to point to people in the community as hypocrites.  I saw this role as extremely important in the book.  By the time the showdown between the town and Jillian arrives, I was ready for someone to take a stand.<br />I would heartily recommend this book to anyone.  You don't even have to read the other 2 books first.	2001-11-18
US	49445874	RMUDEBEN8HEUD	1575669048	49279183	Grace And Favor	Books	4	2	3	N	N	An interesting story	I liked this book. I thought that the characters of Grace and Favor/Pat were well written.  They were two sides of the same coin and they illustrate how circumstance can affect your perception of the people around you.<br />Grace is an author of romance novels.  When she was younger, her mother got pregnant for the second time and then died after the baby (Favor/Pat) was born.  Grace does not have a relationship with her father, as she was abandoned when her mother died.<br />Pat is the daughter who grew up with her father.  In my opinion, she is a wet blanket.  She is married and has 2 kids, a son &amp; daughter.  She is over protective of her son, and doesn't know her daughter.  <br />The story is as much about two long-lost sisters coming together as it is about Pat's marital problems.  Both sisters know about the other, but Grace doesn't want to be found.  Once Favor/Pat shows up on her doorstep, she is forced to confront the past and what she has always believed to be true.  <br />This book is filled with many different characters who float in and out of Grace and Pat's lives.  I would recommend this story to anyone.	2001-11-18

Ms. Peterson is able to draw you into her characters' lives from the beginning.  In this book, Rachel (from a &quot;Shelter of Hope&quot;) is faced with the trial of working with the man she was engaged to six years ago.  With the added frustration of missing inventory, a scheming girl, and an overbearing landlady, Rachel has her hands full.  However, by learning to trust again and not giving in when things look their worst, Rachel is able to move forward with her life.  <br />Simone &amp; Jeffrey O'Donnell, the main characters in &quot;Shelter of Hope&quot; play only minor roles in this novel, but the reader is given a look into their life--allowing for the first story to come to its full conclusion.	2001-11-16

However, this fits the novel.  Kathleen is a travel writer who has spent her life traveling and hiding from her past.  When her best friend Jimmy dies suddenly, Kathleen is left without bearings--no one for her really to turn to in times of trouble.  However, she remembers a 150-year old divorce case she read many years ago, and decides to investigate it.  Throughout the novel, Kathleen comes to many conclusions about her past, her family and her relationships with men.  She comes to these conclusions through her investigation of the Talbot case.  <br />I didn't think that I would be able to complete this novel.  However, about 1/3 of the way through, I became engrossed in the various stories in the novel, that I couldn't put it down.  I would highly recommend this novel, but make sure you give the beginning enough time to resonate within yourself.	2001-11-16

Just when you think what is going on in this novel, something changes.  I have never read one of Ms. Buchanan's novels before, but the title grabbed me.  I will admit that it was a fast read and I was hooked almost from the beginning of the novel.  <br />The story is the murder of Kaitlin Jordan, who is found washed up on a Miami beach, 10 years after she is supposed to have been murdered by her husband.  The list of suspects changes throughout the novel.  There are many questions--where has she been?  who is she now?  why did she come back?  Through all the twists and turns, Britt Montero becomes not only involved deeply in the mystery, but also in figuring out what she wants out of her life at this point.	2001-11-16

You really have to pay attention while you read the book because they give clues all the way through it.  There is a twist at the end that is totally unexpected.  I had to re-read the last few chapters to make sure I read it right.<br />The story is told from Jack Trainor's point of view.  Jack is a psychiatrist, and has a younger sister Kate.  Kate is a writer, but she seems extremely unstable.  The focus of the story is Jack's differing relationships with women.  By the end of the story, there is a resolution in both Kate's relationships with men through the resolution of Jack's relationship with women.  All this resolution comes because Jack faces the truth of the horrible event that framed their youth.  <br />I would highly recommend this book.  The librarian who checked it out to me told me it was strange, but I disagree.  It takes a little bit to get used to, but the story grabs you as you get further in.  Happy reading!	2001-11-09

Ragny, on finding out her father's plan to marry her (to himself), runs away.  Seffrin, her father's man (or so it seems) chases after her on her father's order.  Soon, he realizes that something protects her from harm, and allows her to accomplish her goals.  They go to France &amp; meet the King, save the kingdom, marry the princess.....you get the picture.  <br />The plot is pretty typical--about the only twist is the force protecting Ragny--she never seems to be aware of it consciously.  Others see it at times, but they discount it to sunlight.  <br />I thought this was a good book because it was well written and mingled fact and fiction seamlessly.  The book, if it had been any longer, would have been boring and too drawn out.  It is just the right length for the story Ms. Holland was trying to present.  I would recommend it for a quick read.	2001-11-07

The characters were interesting and well written, the plot was unlike anything I had ever read, and the details were fascinating.  I feel like I am gushing, but the book left me with such a feeling of peace when I was done reading it.  <br />The story is completely fictional, but I could &quot;see&quot; the characters and &quot;hear&quot; their voices.  The idea that there are people out there to help those who have died along their way is something that has interested me, even though I don't totally buy into the theory.  The parts of the story with the young Oisin and his twin Nieve countered with those of Aisling and her brother are heart rending.  <br />The novel is one of a reawakening and a realization that one can overcome the losses faced in your youth.  Through Aisling, Oisin is able to absolve himself of his guilt for the death of his twin, and Aisling is able to achieve the one thing she was denied while she was alive.  <br />This is a wonderful book, and I would heartily recommend it.	2001-11-06

I have been fascinated with the Harvey Girls for a while, but haven't had the opportunity to read much about them (other than watching the Judy Garland movie).  I liked the way that Ms. Peterson wove historical elements into her fictional landscape.  The country was a different place in the late 1800s and I believe that this story illustrates that.  Simone's father held dominion over her in everyway until he sold her--and even then, still controlled her life through fear of discovery.  Only with the redeeming power of her confession to God, love of Jeffery can she take back her life--but first she has to learn not only to trust again, but to allow people to become close to her.<br />A good book and I am going to pick up book 2.	2001-11-05

The main characters in &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; are relegated to minor characters in this book and the focus is on Luke Easton and Darcy.  <br />What struck me in this book was the situation Ruby McCann.  Without giving it away, once you finish the book, and you reflect on the series as a whole, some of Ruby's actions in &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; will make some sense.  <br />The bitterness that Will feels toward Darcy for the murder of his son, no matter how justified, illustrates how hate and vengeance can twist a person's personality and soul.  Buck shows Darcy that even the worse things in a person can be redeemed.  Through Luke, Darcy realizes that there are men in the world who are decent and loving; and Darcy shows Luke that it's ok to crawl out from under the burden of grief.  <br />This was a good book, and I would recommend it to anyone, although you should read &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; first, I don't think it's a requirement--none of the true surprises in &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; are given away in &quot;Hide &amp; Seek.&quot;	2001-11-05

Little Nick is a hoot all throughout this book--the innocence of the young is truly a remarkable thing.  <br />There were parts, now that I am done reading it that were predictable, but while you are reading it, you don't necessarily realize it.  <br />A good book, and I would recommend it for an easy escape.	2001-11-05

I thought it was well-written and had plenty of real history woven in.  I thought it was interesting that I had actually walked on some of the same streets that her characters were on--only about 100 years later!  The story line was good--about the only thing that bothered me--not much--but some, was that it seemed like Kit was constantly quoting scripture or God's message.  I realize that is an important trait to her, but it seemed like she based her relationships on that fact alone.  That meant that I wasn't able to get as in touch with her as I have been able to connect with other of Tracie Peterson's characters (Grace in the Yukon stories, for example).<br />All in all, I liked this story--especially the character of John Barrymore.  Just another real history facet thrown in, but he supplied a much needed comic relief to the story.  <br />I highly recommend this book, but make sure you read her &quot;Yukon&quot; stories as well.	2001-11-02

I loved the Jewish/Catholic interaction at Joyce's house, and how Kathleen overcame her struggles.  This book is definitely a book for women--the male characters are not very strong (with the exception of Buddy, you hardly see them).  <br />I felt there were two different dynamics going on--at Joyce's house, you have the age-old mother-daughter conflict, and then at Kathleen's house, you have the attachment between mother &amp; son, but with &quot;duelling&quot; sons.  I felt that I could see how the characters changed over the course of the summer, and how they grew into all of their relationships, making their own lives better.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone--but definitely read &quot;The Red Tent&quot; as well.	2001-11-02

The story of someone who thinks they are all alone in the world and then suddenly finding out that they aren't is very appealing (not quite the right word, but it will do).  <br />Jessie has longed for a family since she was born &amp; now she has one, but there are too many undercurrents for her to be trusting.  When bad things start happening to her, she isn't able to talk to anyone about them because she is unsure of who to trust.  Finally, she begins to trust the only other outsider in the family--the adopted son, Ross.  <br />One good thing about this book is that the reader doesn't find out who does it until the last 15 pages or so---which leads to a speedy ending.  And the epilogue has just enough information in it to resolve some of the loose threads at the end of the actual story.  I liked the characters of Sarah, Ross &amp; Jessie.  I thought that I was right there with Jessie while she was figuring out who was who and why they want her.  One thing that kind of bothered me (very petty, but it did) was that the cover of the book had a locket on it--so figured that there would be a necklace that would be important in the book, but that is not the case--it's a book that plays the main clue as to identity.<br />A good book &amp; I would recommend it to anyone.	2001-10-30

This book continues their story after 18 years and Nicole (Elspeth) and Anne (Antoinette) have grown up with the other set of parents.  I felt that the characters had grown considerably between the two books---Mr. Price had acknowledged his errors in the past and was seeking to redeem himself.

I picked this book up because I heard that her previous book was well written.  Once you get used to the fact that the book is written from 8 different people's perspectives, it's a pretty good read.  However, it takes 20 pages or so to get used to it.  I thought that the character's narratives brought the individuals to life (even if I did want to strangle some of them for their behavior).  <br />The main story is about Lavinia and Maude's relationship for the 10 years between the deaths of Queen Victoria and her son King Edward.  The story starts when they are 5 and ends when they are 14 or 15.  Throughout this time, many things change in their worlds that they have to adjust to.  <br />I would highly recommend this book.  It is a very fast read.	2001-10-25

Once I got past the really awesome cover, I found a book that grabbed me on the inside.  The idea of angels surrounding us at all times spoke to something inside of me.

I could put myself in the various character's minds to find out what made them tick.  Their emotions became real to me because of how well this book is written.

I find that inspiring and admirable.  i would highly recommend this book.	2001-10-17

You can see all the double-agents, but when something actually goes through, it's a total surprise. Ms. Wurts' language and descriptions just seem to jump off the page. I also noticed that she has started dating the beginning of every chapter--which helps a lot. the development of lysaer and arithon's hatred gets more intense. i felt like i could actually see arithon's anguish at the lies being spread; and i was indignant with how lysaer's ego gets bigger &amp; bigger. i can't wait for the next book in the series to come out!	2001-08-29

However, I thought this book was very well written, a good sequel to &quot;the Secret Diary,&quot; as it mentions the diary throughout the book.  <br />I did think that the battles at the end just drug on &amp; on...I just wanted to get to the meat of the story.

I had a sneaking suspicion that the author was related, somehow, to the main characters in the book---but maybe it was just coincidence that her grandparent's names were the same.  <br />Anyway, a good book...enjoy!	2001-08-03

I was originally interested book after watching Mr. Brokaw's interview on &quot;Tim Russert&quot; a few weeks ago (he was actually talking about his 3rd book about the Greatest Generation).  I will admit that I have been caught up in all the &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; hoopla recently, but this book transcends that.  The first 3/4 of the book had me engrossed--I think because it was about ordinary people who did extraordinary things.  The last 1/4 didn't have my attention as much--again, I think it was because it was about &quot;famous&quot; people.  Although their stories were interesting, they weren't as personal as the non-famous ones.  <br />This book has awakened in me the need to talk to my grandparents about the war--before it is too late.  If that's the only lesson anyone takes away from this book, then I think that it has done its job.	2001-05-29

I think that Arithon is much more interesting than Lysaer, who has become a pompous arse.  Arithon's struggle to accommodate his loss of Mage sight is courageous, along with his determine to follow the MasterBard's wishes to go to his family and tell his story.  <br />The Fellowship of Seven, although sneaky, are a lot of fun to read about.  The way they are written about makes me able to see them while I read.  <br />This is a great series--and although it did take me a while to get started--it is truly worth the effort, because the majority of the book moves very quickly.	2001-05-28

While I don't believe that this story can be placed in real life, I think that it does typify the style of literature in this period.<br />In Maggie, there is someone who is truly an innocent, but through her life, teaches herself to take what life gives her and not fight for the things she truly loves.  Only at the end, does she realize that she does have to have some kind of passion in her life.  However, her duty/need to be accepted by her family tugs her in the opposite direction.<br />In Tom, the duty to family is exemplified--to an extreme.  His narrowness drives people away, and although he is to be respected for his drive to overcome, it comes at a high price.  It is left to the reader to decide if it was truly worth the cost.<br />Phillip, in my mind, is the hero of the story.  Born with a deformity, he is accepted by those one would think would shun him.  His outlook is to find passion in everything--for instance, if you don't sing well, don't let that stop you...as long as you are passionate about it, it will be fine.  In Maggie, he finds someone that he can care about and who cares about him.<br />Be ready for a great story.	2001-05-28

I finished this book in a few hours, and although it is a good escape from the doldrums of summer, there are a few things to complain about.  First---this should be out in just a regular paperback--not the oversized version that is currently available.  This book is NOT worth...its price...  Mainly because the lines are spread out on the page and the font is WAY bigger than any of the other fonts in Ludlum's books.  <br />Second, while I do agree with another reviewer that there are inconsistencies in the book, I don't think they detract 100% from the story.  The story is essentially about how Jon gets on with his life in his new capacity as a cipher for Covert One (which isn't really explained).  There are just too many coincidences in the book and characters show up just so that they can be named (Randi, Megan, Klein) and to keep some continuity in the series.  The whole point behind to book, the theft of the smallpox virus, is solved in the first 100 pages, (at least to the reader) and then it's just left to the characters to solve the mystery.  And, since I read this book after reading the Parsifal Mosiac, I can honestly say that the way the mystery is handled is NOT Ludlum's writing.  <br />Some collaborations work--this one does to a limited extent, but it is trading in on Ludlum's name, and unfortunately, the fact that he recently passed away in order to sell books and hoping that the readers won't really notice. <br />All in all, even if Ludlum didn't write this book, and there are inconsistencies, enjoy the book for what it is--an escape from the doldrums of summer.	2001-05-21

However, I do think, along with some of the other reviewers, that after a 5 year hiatus, Nick would not be nearly as &quot;up&quot; on his game as he is portrayed...and the convenient &quot;I lost my wife, but oh, wait--I found her&quot; is a little too predictable.

Even though there was a lot of medical/research jargon in there that I didn't completely understand, that was fine.  But I loved how up-to-date it was.  The technology Marty used, the medical/research stuff, everything was current.  The way the characters interacted was great--I never really knew who to trust and who not to trust--which only added to my pleasure of the book.  <br />As for Marty--I hope he shows up again.  I love how the author was willing to just let fancy take his course when Marty was off his meds.  I knew that his condition was serious, but to see Marty interact with society was hilarious.  He always managed to be friends with the most unlikely people.<br />Anyway, a good book.  I hope you enjoy it---take it to the beach and let your imagination go.	2001-05-04

The book is a satire of the Gothic novel, but I think it is more than that.  It's the story how the words one person says may be reflected onto someone else and how they can be interpreted to either enrich or ruin another's life.  The way that John Thorpe, in order to make himself look better, &quot;enriched&quot; Catherine's story; the diverging opinions of James &amp; Isabella; the general falseness of Isabella &amp; John; and how the simplest statement can be misconstrued &amp; almost ruin a friendship.  <br />Catherine, by living in her novels (aided by Henry, of course), sees things that aren't really there when she visits Northanger Abbey.  She makes mountains out of mole-hills. Thankfully, Henry acknowledges the role he had in creating these fantasies and is able to help her laugh it off. <br />This is a great Austen novel, and although you can tell that it was her first, I think it ranks right up there with the others.	2001-02-13

The beginning was very well written, I thought--easy to understand, easy to follow, etc.  However, I thought the way the book was divided was a little odd...some chapters made perfect sense, others tended to jump around in time (one minute QE had just been crowned, the next she was almost dead and then it was 25 years prior to her death).  <br />I thought that Mr. Hibbert did a great job of laying out the facts without being overzealous in giving the reader his own opinion.  It was easy to draw certain opinions of QE's behaviour, but whether that was because the book was so well written or because there has lately been an influx of movies, etc about QE, I couldn't say.  <br />I really came to know QE during the reading of this book.  Although she was portrayed to her subjects as a goddess (Gloriana, whatever), she really was a paranoid, hysterical, inconsisten human being.  Mr. Hibbert did a GREAT job in bringing out the &quot;humanness&quot; of QE.	2001-02-05

The only relationship I was left wondering about what the one between Joel and Larry...it is never quite resolved.  <br />The ability of Mr. Ludlum to write a book of such scope and depth is a real testament to his knowledge of the world around him and the written word.

I don't usually like &quot;War&quot; novels, but this book is wonderful.  The dialogue is good, the plot draws you in &amp; you really come to care about the characters.  I felt like I got to know George, Orry, Madeline, Constance, Billy &amp; Charles, Brett &amp; Ashton. <br />The only downfall I could find with this book is that I feel like I was reading EVERYTHING about every day of their lives.  It makes the book richer, yes, but it also can be very draining to read.<br />In fact, instead of just launching myself into the 2nd book (which is what I usually do), I am taking a break.  The topics covered in N&amp;S are so deep that you almost have to do that in order to bring yourself back to the current time.  <br />With all that, please pick up this book &amp; transport yourself to a different time, where everything WASN'T black &amp; white.	2001-01-29

I read it after reading the other 2 books in the trilogy &amp; everything was so much richer, and made much more sense.  I could feel the betrayal that Avalon felt from Arthur.  Gwen was a perfect symbol for the rising &quot;sect&quot; of Christianity in that period---so much so that I honestly began to hate her--she used Arthur's guilt to get him to dishonor Avalon.  Avalon wasn't blameless throughout the book, and I am happy that everyone was shown in equal light.  The way that Vivaine used her sisters and niece took some getting used to--but it was necessary to make the events follow their plans.  <br />I am going to recommend this book to everyone I know.  Even if you don't really like Athurian legend, this is still a great book.	2001-01-23

I think that it could have done with some updating.  The book is a good read--a fast read.  I found the lapses in time a little confusing, but I liked Andy &amp; Phyllis.  I didn't really know what to do about Madison &amp; Bonner, though.  It seemed to be a case of the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing, all throughout the book--which makes it suspenseful, i guess, but rather confusing.  I tended to forget who was on which bad-guy team.  The ending of the book is pretty predictible once you get to the last few sections--but there are some twists thrown in.   A good read if you don't mind low-tech technothrillers.	2001-01-01

Although I must echo the sentiments of another poster--at least Nicci's character is developed in this book.  There are times I absolutely hated her, and other times that I could see how she was changing.  Once again, Richard &amp; Kahlan are separated to fight their own battles.  At times, it seems like for every character Goodkind kills off, he adds 10 more.  Although I think that he does at least try to mention most of the characters in every book.  I found myself having to go back to figure out who everyone was and what their relationships were.  <br />One thing I really liked in this book was the &quot;Resistance&quot; movement that Kahlan and the Sisters put together.  That showed some variety that I was not expecting.  And who knew Richard had so much sculpting talent in him?  I think that the relationships he forged in the Old World will come back to help him later on.  <br />I can't wait for the next book.	2000-12-29

Once again, i was transported back in time and space to see a character who was infinitely flawed.  mary was perhaps a little too naive, too trusting, and too impulsive. There were many moments i that i wished i could just reach out and throttle her; but then again, there were moments that my heart just broke for the realizations that she made.<br />One can almost imagine how history would have been changed if she hadn't gone to Elizabeth thinking that Elizabeth remembered the promise she made to Mary, or if Mary had only THOUGHT before some of her actions.  Great Britain would be a totally different place.  <br />There were many touching scenes in the book, and of course, one of those was the execution scene...it had me in tears.  And then to follow that with the spirit's journey was a very powerful decision on Ms. George's part.  <br />To understand how someone can be so mislead, betrayed, loved, misunderstood and naive, just pick up this book.  I highly recommend it.	2000-12-29

The beginning was RATHER slow, and i found myself skipping over some of the more techno-jargon that i didn't really think i needed to know to enjoy the book.  That being the case, not reading those sections, didn't hinder my enjoyment reading another good book by mr. clancy.  however, i would recommend to anyone who reads this to re-read &quot;Executive Order&quot; and *maybe* &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; and &quot;Debt of Honor.&quot;  Since it had been a while since i had read those books, i found myself scouring my brain to remember the correct circumstances the characters were referring to.   With all of that said--the last 100-200 pages move like lightening and are very exciting.  Enjoy!	2000-12-26

The plot, although slightly unrealistic, keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.  the only thing that got to me by the end was ALL the killing--that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it just seemed that for the last few hundred pages, someone was killed every few pages.  and i would recommend keeping a pen and paper near by to keep track of who is in charge and where they are.  i thought that &quot;Tye&quot; was a believable character and that jackson was a laugh a minute.  amaya was very resourceful, considering the circumstances.  at any rate--this will not be the last ludlum book i buy.	2000-12-18

Finally, I read it and I am very glad i did.  Although you can figure the secret out pretty far in advance, the fact that the narrator/investigator spends the time trying to PROVE his solution to himself shows what a marvelous work this is.  He doesn't go wildly off into the night telling anyone, he tries to get the lady to tell her husband of her own will.  the slight touch of romance, and deep sense of justice and mystery lend this book to a long weekend's worth of reading.	2000-12-12

I read this book in about a day---and unlike some of the other readers, i didn't have a pen handy to keep track of all the relationships, but that didn't hinder (too much) my understanding of the book.  I thought that the book was well written, as it kept me on my toes to remember who said what and when.  Some of the details were a little over the top, but she did a very good job at keeping the suspense going.  You never know who to trust or who not to trust until the very end.  As for the ending, it was a little bit of a disappointment after just a race to the end to see just WHAT are in these manuscripts, but i thought this book could easily have been made a lot longer without it drawing it out too much.  I was very hesitant about reading this book, since i don't like first-person very much, but without the first-person narrative, it wouldn't have been nearly as good.	2000-11-28

The constant  fighting between the factions of Llewelyn &amp; Davydd is depressing, and  the constant switching at sides is confusing.  However, that was the time  they lived.  The political battles of the Middle Ages were heavily  intrigued, and the author does a great job of showing what really mattered.   <br />The fictional characters were not as much in the way as they were  spectators.  They allow for the author to comment on the times, and the  action.  Without Hugh, we may never have known what it meant in their  culture to be high-born but orphaned and penniless.  With Caitlin, we were  able to see a young lady who felt as passionately about Wales as her uncle,  and she had the courage to stand up to her father.  <br />The love between  Llewelyn and Ellen seemed to be a deep one, although fraught with tragedy  and sacrifice.  And it also provided a nice parallel to Llewelyn Fawr and  Joanna, and a nice way to close the trilogy.  <br />Although I was always  hoping that Wales could pull through against England, I knew that it was  just not meant to be.  The conditions were not right, and obviously, they  are now a part of the English Crown and have been for centuries.  That is  what was depressing about the last book in the trilogy.  But at least we as  readers are left with the hopes that the lessons were not taught in vain,  and the knowledge that we now have these marvelous characters to inspire  us.	2000-08-05
US	49445874	R185R4WLYOCOWD	0684834731	589139798	The Locket	Books	5	6	6	N	N	a fantastic read	Since I am about the same age as the main character in this book, I took a lot of it to heart.  I am usually put off by first person narratives, such  as this book, but this one had a way of allowing me to internalize the  feelings of Michael and feel what he was feeling.  The reader quickly  realizes that Esther is not what she seems...she is a person living on  hope, but comes across as one who wants to be shut away from the world.   <br />This book makes you realize the need for second chances in life.  If  that is the one thing you take away from reading this, then you have at  least made a start.  There are lessons throughout this book, just waiting  to be found.  I admit, I was given this book shortly after it came out, and  it has sat on my bookshelf until today.  It was so good, I finished it in  less than 3 hours.  Other than putting the book in your hands, I don't know  a way to more strongly recommend this book.	2000-08-05
US	49445874	R2CGTSJVHZB6GJ	0345382846	905379525	Here Be Dragons	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Wow!	This book is wonderful.  I wasn't too sure when I first picked it up if I was going to like it, mainly because the beginning, is a little dry (but it sets the stage for other things to come).  However, once I got into the  book, I found it very hard to put it down.  Joanna's behavior is  understandable, given her circumstances.  First, she has to overcome the  death of her mother and the revelations that are exposed about her.  Then,  when she thinks her life is happy, she is forced into a marriage with her  father's bitterest enemy AND she has to travel to a unknown land, where she  doesn't speak the language or know the customs.  Once there, she has to  deal with a recalitrant stepson who can do no wrong in the eyes of his  father.  Llewelyn is a character that is shown to be human, but possibly  too perfectly human.  He has his faults, but we are shown them as  strengths.<br />I found myself sympathizing with Joanna, Llewelyn, and King  John, and the rest because I found myself CARING about what happened to  them.  There were times that I was in tears over a particular situation (I  don't want to spoil anything).  The author has a way of bringing these  people to life who lived so long ago.  You can see their expressions, see  how and where they live, all in her words and imagery.  I can't wait to  pick up books 2 &amp; 3 in the series.	2000-07-24

I loved the first 3 books, but there wasn't this insane urge to rush out and buy the next one when it came out.  Book 4, however, fixed that.  When I finished it late last night, I  immediately wanted to pick up the next one.  This book is a departure from  the other 3.  The series has been getting slightly darker since book 1; but  in this book, the darkness that is You-Know-Who really comes into play and  of course Harry is left to deal with the ramifications.<br />This book had  so many twists and turns that just drew me along with them.  I didn't know  who I was supposed to like and who I wasn't.  And not all the webs have  come unraveled.  Now we have 2 more schools that will have to be reckoned  with in the next 3 books.  Also, there are secrets revealed whose effects  will be felt in all the following books.  However, Harry, with the help of  Ron and Hermoine, Dumbledorf, Sirius and Hagrid, will be able to overcome  them all.	2000-07-15

The author constantly rehashes the old story line (in  order for new readers to know what is going on), often to the detriment of  the main characters.  I really just wanted them all to quit whining and DO  something about their lives.  There was a lot of emphasis on Drew and  Iris's relationship.  Syvie (one of the central players) I felt was pushed  to the side and not many things about her were resolved.   If you are  looking for something light to read while you are at the beach, then this  is for you.  If you want to care about the characters and see a sequel  resolve the issues in the first book, this is probably not the book for  you.	2000-07-15

At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages.  But  the story is more than the blurb on the back cover.  It is about betrayal,  last wishes, the &quot;evils&quot; of drink, and how one mistake can affect  you 21 years down the road.  Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through  Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.<br />Like many of  the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book.  There are constant  turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it  into the depths of depression.  This book is not an easy read though.  There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry,  but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.<br />I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_  that made me buy this book.  Enjoy!	2000-07-15

I picked this book up 6 months ago because it looked interesting and it is about a period of history that I am fascinated with.  However, it sat on my shelf until  last week, when I finally read it.  I was immediately intrigued.  The  characters were well fleshed out and even the observers became important to  me (at times I cared a little bit more about what happened to Ranulf than I  did about what happened to Henry).  There are attitudes and beliefs that  are integral to the time period that she brings out in the story to make it  even more realistic.   I do agree with another reviewer though...it is hard  to keep track of who is earl of what and whose side he is on.  But overall,  she makes the main characters so real that you are affected by what happens  to them.  Her writing also makes me actually able to visualize the setting.  I think the book is extremely well written, and I can't wait until the next  one in the series comes out.	2000-07-15

Imagine the shock of getting ready for your parent's 40th wedding anniversary only to recieve a call from your sister telling you that your mom shot your dad.  The ensuing developments push all your petty personal  concerns out of the way as you struggle to deal with the reality of your  parent's marriage and splits your family.   Daphne, Alex and Kitty,  throughout the course of this novel realize what really matters in their  life.  They come to realize that each of them had their own disillusions  about their parents and that they really weren't perfect.  That realization  forces the sisters to re-examine their current situations, and accept that  blood really is thicker than water.   I enjoyed reading this book.  The  situations that the sisters were placed in rang true for some, and a little  hackneyed for others. There weren't any REAL surprises, especially if you  have read other books by the author.  But for a quick escape from your own  life, this is probably a book for you.	2000-07-15

When my mom saw it on my Christmas list, she asked me why I, a 25 year old college grad, would want a kid's book? I told her that I wanted to see what  all the fuss was about.  So she bought it for me and I put off reading it  until about a month ago. Surprisingly, I was hooked.  So I rushed out and  bought book 2.  I know that everyone has been going on about how wonderful  the books are, but I am pleasantly surprised by the depth of these books.  The &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; has so many layers that I found it hard  to keep track of at times.  However, the book itself is so engrossing, I  read it in one sitting.  Although Harry is only a teenager, Rowling writes  him in such a way that people of all ages can either look forward to being  that age and having similar situations and thoughts, or look back on when  their lives were much simpler.  The reader is led through Harry's struggle  to understand what being a wizard is all about and who is really is. And  the latter is something we all face.	2000-07-01

To fill the void, I watched the Left Behind website chats to see if I was on the right track as to who killed Nicolae.  I couldn't wait for The Indwelling  to come out and I bought it as soon as I could.  The beginning offered an  opportunity to reaquaint myself with the main characters. I realized just  how far Rayford had sunk into his depression. The part of the book that  held my attention were the &quot;dreams&quot; that Tsion had.  The language  in those sequences were obviously biblical, but they were also reminiscent  of Dante's journey in The Divine Comedy and the fall of Satan in Milton's  Paradise Lost.  The authors &quot;allowed&quot; Tsion to react as any  person would--by having him reference his documents.  That part of the book  was worth the price of the book.   The authors have not totally  disappointed their readers---there are still some questions that need to be  answered, and will be answered in the next segment--I can hardly wait.	2000-06-29

I enjoyed the challenge of the language.  I felt like it was written at a higher level than other books with the word choice, sentence structure, etc.  I also like how the  characters were developed--both corporeal and noncorporeal ones.  There  were many times when I just laughed aloud at the dialogue and actions of  certain characters.   The only thing that I did not like about the book is  that I felt &quot;dropped&quot; into the world.  With other series, the  author usually provides a map and introduces the kind of magic and how it  is used.  After reading book 1, I still do not feel like I totally  understand the world that she is having us inhabit.  Hopefully, book 2 will  make it clearer.   This book is definitely one that needs to be read in  long sittings--10 to 15 minutes a sitting will just leave you more confused  and lost than if you can devote 30 minutes to an hour.

I am not a big fan of first person narrative, but was able to get into the main character of this one.  The mystery has several layers (albeit thin  ones).  Just wehen you think you have it figured out, something else  happens.  Although parts of the book were pretty predictible, I did like  how the past kept influencing the present.  I did like how the author  brought the papacy up to date and allowed for the priests to be fallible.   A good book if you are looking for something light to read.	2000-05-30
