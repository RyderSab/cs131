The characters in this book were excellent.  Alex is a complex man with a complex life.  He has lived a life of solving life's puzzles, a very intelligent man with a heart of gold, even though his intentions are good his actions can be somewhat deceptive, \\"give people what they want to get what you want\\" is the theory Alex lives by.  When a man from Alex's past kills his best and only friend all he can think of is revenge, no matter what the cost or whom he hurts, Ledford will pay.  <BR>Caitlin has all she wants, but with money problems.  She has Vasaro, family & friends, but how long she can keep Vasaro afloat before the bank takes over?  Then Alex comes along with an offer anyone in her position couldn't refuse. <BR>The question is can they both make it out of this deal alive...<br />I didn't read the Wind Dancer series in order because I couldn't get my hands on them in the order they were written, but you don't have to, each book tells its own tale.  One day I will start from the first book and end on the last though... that's how good these books are :) I can't even name which is my favorite they are all great.  Final Target was the latest addition to this series and I hope Iris Johansen brings these characters back to life again at least one more time.  <br />An excellent read, it wont be a waste of your time.	2002-05-30

I wasn't happy about this, but once again Goodkind helps you see why it was needed in the story, not only to give back hope to Richard but to many others also.  <br />I read many reviews on this book, and only a couple things I read rang true to me.  First, Goodkind does repeat many issues over and over, to the point you find your self wondering if hes ever just going to get on with it, and 2.  The novels need more magic,  Richard is a war wizard and never uses his power.  <br />Well now I am done with the complaining.  Never the less this novel was great along with the rest. This novel starts right where the last ends.  Kahlan is recovering from her injuries in a secluded Mountian / Forest home with Richard and Cara by her side.  Richard decides that he must stand aside from the war until the people choose to be free and like nothing more to but to be free.   Richard would like to spend his time, if not forever in his sheltered home but Nicci, Sister of the Dark, has different plans in mind.  Nicci on her search for answers kidnaps Richard and takes him to the old world, where Richard is to learn her meaning of being free and what (her idea of real people) have to do to get by.  While Richard is gone, Kahlan decides to go back to the war to pass time and claim her revenge on Richards kidnapping.  Kahlan re-unites with Zedd and the Sisters of the Light and her army. The real Parlet goes off in search for Nathin, in hopes to keep him under raps. The ending was the best of the whole novel, and makes the few flaws mediocre in comparison.  If you have read and enjoyed the rest of this series then this addition wont let you down. I will impatiently wait for the next novel.	2001-07-10

When a 9 year old little boys day starts off he never imagined the events of the day would ever happen.  Erics friend decides hes going to sneak a peak at his parents .38 caliber gun tragedy strikes. Erics baby sister is shot!  Thats all he sees at first, then reality sets in, his friend let him see and hold the gun when the phone rings and the gun accidently goes off. Now Eric, his mother and step father have to learn to survive after such a horrid accident.<br />I've heard of such tragedy on the news, seen it in the newspapers and still yet this novel opened my eyes.  I have a 5 year old child, and after reading this novel I honestly believe there will never be a gun in my home.  Reality is no matter how hard we try to protect our children from violence and guns they seem to get a hold of them no matter how hard we try.  Locking up our guns, hiding them and teaching them NOT to touch reality is they still find them, are still curious and still more times then not a catastrophe occurs.<br />The end of the novel was a little disapointing, still this book deserves 5 stars.  This is a great novel for everyone, but a must read for any parent.	2001-02-08

This trio finds themselves in the middle of a scientific conspiracy of cloning and the longevity  of human life. While on the search for the truth, they find unthinkable tasks going on around them.  The conspirators are of all sorts, rich wanting longer life, scientists just interested in the science and longer life, almost every one around the trio.  Now that they have figured out most of the facts in this conspiracy, they have to figure out how to solve the problem and get out alive.<br />I enjoyed this nove, but was disapointed in the ending.  I felt that with all the information shared and the complex story line, that the author cut the end of the novle short, and in the process made the ending predictable which didn't hold up to the great story weaved out for us. This was a great read, very informational.  The characters were great the author did a wonderful job brining them to life. The concept of cloning I am sure is not that far off, lets just hope it never gets to the point it did in this novel. I can't say this is a must read, but I can say it wont be a waste of time.	2001-01-31

Borrow it from a friend or a library.  First of all, I don't have to much insight on English policing, so when they named officers I wasn't sure which were officers or detectives and such.  I often had to back track tring to keep names straight, thus taking the book longer to read.  <br />The plot wasn't bad, although I knew who the murderer was from the beginning.  A woman is found dead on a shore of Chapman's Pool by two young boys.  The murdered womans credibility is thrashed,her motives questioned and her parenting skills abolished all to find her murderer.   Unlike other reviewers, I liked the occasional drifts from the main story, to Nick Ingram and Maggie Jenner, no these parts of the novel do not have anything to do with the main plot, but its a nice escape from all the technical jumbo.<br />All in all this book was O.K., I probably wont read it again...	2000-10-14

I have read all of Terry Goodkinds, Sword of Truth series aside of his new addition &quot;Faith of the Fallen&quot;, a book which I intend to read.  My curiosity comes form the reviews I read in Terry Goodkinds series here on amazon.  I read some similarities in comparison to Terry Goodkind, in this novel, but not enough to give away any part of the story and nothing to even remotely say either of the stories are in any way alike.  This novel in my opinion is extremely different, yet very worth the read.<br />The reason I gave this novel four stars is, first, the story moved very slowly.  It took me awhile to read because of boredom. There are many detailed senary parts many chapters that seemed to be never ending.  Second the characters seemed to be one sided, Robert Jordan never really lets you get to know the characters, where as in Terry Goodkinds series, I felt as if I knew them all personally, felt what they felt, saw what they saw and so on.  The end of this novel though, made the whole book worth reading, I really enjoyed the ending.  The book picked up about half way through, but really picked up at the end, where I felt I couldn't put the book down.  <br />This novel, some what reads like a soap opera.  Its about three farm boys whos lives are drastically altered.  Running from the Dark Ones grasp, yet not understanding why or what for, they weave a pattern around them.  <br />I will read the next book to this series when I find time.  If you like fantasy novels, you will like this novel without a doubt.  I also would recommend Terry Goodkinds Sword of Truth series, starting with the Wizards First Rule.	2000-10-10

The only reason I didn't give this book five stars was because the ending was predictable, not that it at all made the story bad or took away from the story.

Velmas final faith in God, the  victims fellings of loss, betrayal and pain, Velmas familys issues of  deceit, of denial, guilt, memories of happy times and sad, and pain along  with Velmas friends of old and new whom stood beside her till her final  breath are all bits and pieces of this heart-wrenching true story.<br />I  really can't say I am for or against the death penalty, I'm not sure anyone  really knows until you are the victim of a murdered family/friend or on the  other side and a family/friend of the murderer... no-one wants a loved one  to die in any way.  And this book showed both sides I felt for Velmas  family and friends and I also felt for the victims of such horrible deaths.   This is the first novel of a true life nature that I have read, and some  how it all seems so unreal... When I first found out what Velma did I was  appalled, and I am still appalled and do not aprove of her actions, but  then my heart started opening up to her family - if they could forgive her  for murdering there mother/grandmother/greatgrandmother and her childrens  father and still stand behind her - it broke my heart.<br />This is a novel of  great controversy, there aren't any easy answers in my eyes, we forget that  theirs always victims on both sides - but this was by far well written  book.	2000-09-20

I found it drown  out to say the least slow.<br />This novel was about a married couple, Steve  and Meredith, who were always on a different path in life, but they made  their relationship work for them.  Meredith gets a job offer in San  Francisco she couldn't refuse but its a long distance from her cozy job on  Wall Street. Her husband is understanding and sees the opportunities for  her and tells her to go for it, and that he would meet her out there as  soon as he could.  But that much distance is hard on a relationship and the  two start to learn that fact out real fast.<br />I liked Steve alot, yet  Steel never really gave you a chance to get to know him, or any of the  characters.  I was bothered by the fact that Meredith had no plans in her  future for children, while Steve would have loved to have children, yet  shortly after she gets to know her new boss the prospect of having children  with him and not her husband doesn't seem like such a bad idea any more.  I  also felt that Steel makes it too easy to just give up on a relationship,  which was hard to want to believe.  This isn't my first Danielle Steel  novel and I am sure it wont be my last, but its definitely not her best  work.	2000-09-12

The whole  story broke my heart, made me laugh and sucked me into a great pager  turner.  I love the description of the wild life and scenery, it was really  relaxing.  The characters - they were great, I felt what they felt, I saw  what they saw.  I thought I knew who the murderer was, I was positive I  knew who the murderer was, and yet I was so wrong!  I read other reviews,  some who say they knew who the killer was right from the beginning, and  others who made the wrong choice like me or just didn't know... I can't say  I believe anyone knew from the beginning who &quot;dunnit&quot; I just  can't see how.  <br />Sam &amp; Julie met on a movie set, and from the start  were in love.  They got married and had a daughter, Olivia, and all seems  well.  Sam starts to do drugs and then jealousy, feelings of betrayl and  deceit start to set in.  One night every thing starts to spin out of  control.  All Sam knows is his Julie is dead and that he was holding her  and that his little girl saw too much.  Sam is put in prison for the murder  of his wife by detective Frank Brady.  Twenty years later Noah, the son of  Frank wants to write a book about the Tanner murder, but runs into some  rip-tides with the two that knew anything Sam Tanner and mainly  Olivia.<br />This novel has everything, a good plot, suspense, drama, love  trauma and romance - a great novel and a must read!	2000-09-08

Rory Smilow is a heartless detective, whom plays his role to a  T.  Alex is a perfect citizen, shes a psychologist, with a admirable list  credentials.  Hammond Cross is a district attorney with a excellent track  record and good moral standards.  I think my favorit was Davee Pettijohn,  shes a straight shooter, not caring what anyone thinks of her, and tells  things as they are.  The plot was strong, just when I thought I knew who  the murderer was I changed my mind ... I did that several times.   <br />Detective Rory Smilow is called to the Charles Towne Plaza when a maid  finds the dead body of Lute Pettijohn in his penthouse suite.  Whe the  murder scene leaves hardly any evidence, every one that doesn't like  Pettijohn is now a suspect.  And that list is a never ending one, for Lute  Pettijohn is a tycoon business man and he didn't get there by playing  nice.<br />This novel was fast and great.  Sandra Brown is a wonderful writter  and this novel is no exception.	2000-09-05

All the love  you feel in this novel is outstanding and heart-melting.<br />This book starts  later in the Grant familys life.  Travis and Eves children are all grown  up, either going away to college or following their own dreams of horses  and such.  Brian Donnelly has never held a job for more than three years,  and has no need or want to own anything that he can't throw in a bag or  can't be disposed of when he goes.  But Brian Donnelly has never met a  family like the Grants either.  When Brian meets the Grant family instintly  sparks flew when the eldest daughter the &quot;Ice Princess&quot; Keeley  Grant, walks into the room.  Brian knowing the risk he would be taking if  he were ot pursue the Princess of The Royal Meadows, thinks Keeley is out  of his league and pretends to except it, but the sparks were just the  begining waiting for the flame to take.<br />This is a must read!  And if you  haven't done so already, you should really read Irish Hearts, the 2 in 1  part series of the Grant family from the begining.  This series of novels  are warm, loving romances, and very well paced... Don't let these slip past  you !	2000-08-16

To save a man  that was kidnapped from a reaserch facility that had been burnt to the  ground, Logan brings in Sarah and her search and rescue dog, Monty.  And  from there the danger only starts.<br />This was a very fast paced and fast  read, and well worth my time.  You could just read this book and not bother  reading the others before, because this book could stand alone, but you  would be missing out on so much.  But I recommend reading from the begining  starting with &quot;The face of deception&quot;, &quot; The killing  game&quot; and then &quot; The Search&quot;.  They are all great and must  reads.	2000-08-14

Alot of the book took a direction away from the main characters, Richard and Kahlan... but only to help the story in the end.   This book was full of Terry Goodkinds writting ways, as he has shown in the  other books of this series.  At frist it was hard to follow the new  characters, and I found myself asking what the point to them were, but as  the story unfolded I fully understood that without the new character set,  the story would have been plain.  There were times I wanted to cry, laugh  and I even caught myself yelling at the characters.  This series, I must  say has been my farovite and I hope Mr. Goodkind keeps them coming!  I can  hardly wait to get his new book &quot;Faith of the fallen&quot;, at the end  of August.<br />Well, Kahlan &amp; Richard are finally married!  But because  of there marriage, not realizing it, the two put evil magic to work once  again.  Most of this book took place in Anderith, a city with odd beliefs  of religion and slavery, but also with a great deal of magic unknown to the  citizens.  Corupt rulers are bent on gaining top rule of Andreth, which  leads into the whole plot of &quot;Soul Of the Fire&quot;.  <br />To tell any  more would give to much of the story away.   If you have read and enjoyed  the other four books of this series, this one only adds more to the series.    This book is a must read.	2000-08-11

Its  my opinion that this book would make a great movie.<br />This book was about a  woman (Eve Duncan) who had some really rotten events happen in her life.   She does her best to over come her past with a little help from her  friends.  She goes to college and becomes a forensic sculptor, in the  process, to bring home her past and set it to rest.  But when John Logan  comes into her life and gives her a offer she couldn't refuse, her life,  her familys life, her friends lives and also John Logan him selfs life put  into one of the most risky and dangerous position, * politics  and murder*.   <br />I couldn't put this book down, it was fast paced and I found myself  picturing which actors and actresses would play which part. If you like  suspense and a great story line, then this is a must read!	2000-08-11

I couldn't wait to get this book, and as quick as I got it I read it twice as fast.  I love the characters and following there heart warming, tragic, comical, romantic and much much more stories.  I can only hope the series  never ends, for what could compare to Richard, Kahlan and Zedd! ( and so  many more loveable and hateable characters) I can't say which book I like  the most, I love them all.  <br />This story takes a new twist, the black  Plague.  This time Richard and Kahlan, together, have to find a way to stop  the murderous plague that starts with children and moves its way all the  way to the town prostitute.  Jagang wants to rule the world and doesn't  care how he achieves this goal.  The new characters brought new to this  book add great twitsts for example: Richards brother Drefan of the Roug  Moss the healer and Nadien from his old land.  The Witch Woman, Shota, once  again plays her devious part and does a great job!  I couldn't love and  hate any other witch as her.  Zedd wow who wouldn't love Zedd!  Zedd and  Ann Find themselves in a lot of trouble in the wilds, they made me laugh so  hard, but it was a great balance with the tragic plague that was running  over the land. <br />This book was great, I wouldn't recommend this book for  the younger reader, because there is explicit sex and violence.  But the  sex and the violence made the book all the better, I couldn't fathom the  books with out it!  I have read that some think that our imaginations  should be let to do that on there own well I can say that my imagination  works over time reading Gookinds books,  if you can't handle the explicit  parts page over them but don't miss out on great reading because of that  one reason !   My opinion, Buy this book, Read this book, and enjoy the  story!	2000-07-26

This was two books in one, Irish thoroughbred and Irish Rose. I only have one complaint, that is both stories had too many simularities.  The first stroy line,  Irish thoroughbred, was about a woman, Adelia, whom comes to America to be  with her uncle after her aunts passes away.  Adelias uncle Paddy, works on  one of the finest horse ranches in the states, and takes Adelia under his  wing.  Almost as soon as Adelia arrives she starts falling in love with  Travis Grant, the owner of the horse ranch, Royal Meadows.  The romance and  the way they came together was heart warming and and truly a page  turner.<br />The second book was a continuation of the the first story but  this one was called Irish Rose.  This one has Adelias cousin Erin McKinnon  and Burke Logan added to the story line.  Adelias family and neighbor Burke  take a trip back to Ireland, and ends up bringing her cousin Erin home with  the help of Burke needing assistance back home in the states.  But same as  the first story the two were in love before you could say when.  Not that  it made the story bad, and don't get me wrong the two stories were great  and the romace was great, but they were very simular.  I can say you would  be missing out if you didn't read this book. And after you buy this one buy  the sequel to Irish Hearts, Irish Rebel.	2000-07-21

This one I would like to say is the best, but then again they are all great.  I have read through most of the others reviews and I am  learning very quick not to believe everything I read.  I have enjoyed  reading the first three books in the series and fully intend on reading  every single one until the end of the series.  As for Terry Goodkind coping  others story lines and ruining it for us well take it as you will but he  has great twists and if you ask me a apple is a apple but each has a  different taste, so don't judge so harshly!<br />Once again Richard, Kahlan,  Zedd and the rest of the gang are back tring to save the world from evil.   This time the threat isn't the keeper or the evil wizard Darken Rahl, but  Emperor Jagang and clan of mriswith.   While Kahlan is hiding with the  death spell on her ( the death spell was put there by Zedd) waiting for  Richard to meet up with her, Richard is once again distracted with his  instinct and draws the midlands together to fight against the new evil team  the &quot;Imperial order&quot;. The blood of the fold, believing anthing  with magic is evil is after the mother confessor, and abducts her and takes  her to the sisters of the dark.<br />Once again I will say it as I have in my  past reviews, if you liked the first two books you will like this one just  as much if not more!	2000-07-15

The story starts right off where it left you in WFR.  The characters  were alive and made me feel like I was right there with them on there  journey.   Richard finds out that he made a few mistakes in WFR and has to  set them right.  Richiard gets captured and collared again but this time by  the sisters of the light.  Yet while Richard was captured he accomplished  and learned what was needed to save the world once again from his father  Darken Rahl and the Keeper of the under world.  In the mean time Kahlan  tries to find Zedd to tell him that the sisters of the light have Richard  and she too gets side tracked into a midland war.   This book is a adult  book, no quetsion on that, but I love the way it was written.  If you read  Wizards first rule and enjoyed it you are going to love this one also if  not more.	2000-07-10

This book was about two sisters that had completly different out looks on life, but look identical &quot;Mirror Image&quot;, as the book states numersous times.   The sisters played harmless tircks on friends and family because no-one  could tell them apart but a maid.  But as they got older Victoria found a  love that could ruin the family name and her father forced her to marry a  man with a good name and forced her to forget about her trouble relation  ship.  Victoria tried as hard as she could to love the man her father  demanded her to marry.  Well Victoria asks her sister Olivia to take her  place in her marriage so she can go off and support womans rights...   little did Victoria know that Olivia secretly had feelings for Charles.   And now I will let you learn the rest for yourself.<br />The book all in all  was great.  I didn't like the way they kept reminding you that the two  girls were identical but had very, very differnt opinions on life.  It was  as if they didn't bring it up every chapter we might forget.  I would  definitally recommend this book.	2000-07-04

I really don't understnad all the bad reviews on ths book?  This book may have not been one of the best romance books I have ever read, but it sure held up its end on the drama!  There wasn't much for romance, but the  romance that was there, was written well and fit together with the story  line. I thought the story line was well thought and interesting and kept me  reading!  <br />The morning after is about a woman, named Temple, who wakes up  in a honeymoon suite not knowing how she got there or any of the events of  the past weekend.  All she has to explain her weekend is a marriage  certificate with her name on it and a Michale St. Gerard, a wedding dress  and the slight memory of a some music and a man calling her princess and  telling her not to forget him. Her life seems to be falling apart at the  seems because she finds out on top of a marrage she is pregnate!  She has  help from a friend from work on hiring a detective to put the pieces to  gether.

I didn't buy this book out of my own interest, a good friend told me it was a great book and I am glad to say he was correct! If you can not handle adult  content (sex, language, torture, love, truth and honor) well, no this book  will not be for you.  But without any of that this book would have been one  I would have in my childrens bedroom and would have held no intrest to  me!<br />The Wizards First Rule had me from the begining, putting it down only  when I must.  This book is about a forbidden love, the serch of the truth  and to bring down the reign of A evil Wizard named Darken Rahl.      The  love portion of the story was about Kahlan and Richard and there heart  warming and yet very hopeless love.  Richard is the only real friend that  Kahlan has ever met and the start of love inflames at a great risk to them  both. Terry Goodkind does a great job making you feel as if you are right  there wishing you could do something to change the fates!   Almost every  one knows that seeking the truth at times almost never seems easy.  This  book makes a point of showing how trust at bay is taken very lightly, and  to many believe what they see and hear, and tend to forget or look past the  facts.  Richard must learn to believe in himself and look in his heart, his  mind, his love and his hate for the facts.       Now to the objective of  the story, bringing down the reign of Darken Rahl.  This portion of the  story was well written, and had many odd turns that kept my full attention!   Darken Rahl is a wizard with a whole lot of magic!  His main goal is to  retrieve the a box of orden so he will have the set of all three boxes of  orden.  Also to find a very important book on which box he should open due  to the fact only one will do him any good, so he can rule the world with  his evil magic.    But Kahlan, Richard, Zedd and some of there friends  stand in Darken Rahls way, finding the missing boxfirst and try hiding it  from him.  <br />There is much I haven't said ... the book is over 800 pages  long!  But I assure you every page was well worth reading! And while I wait  for the sequel: Stone of tears, to get here I may just read The wizards  first rule again!  This was a great book ... read it and prove me right !	2000-06-21

But so far I have liked all Sandra Browns books, and not to my suprise it was great, I read it in one day.  The book is about 2  young people who were torn apart by lies and brought back together by  death.  Caroline was the town drunks child and she grew up with the title.   So when she was offered a chance to try to change her title she marries  Roscoe (a very wealthy man),and the father of Rink, whom she had a slight  past with.  When Rink comes home for his fathers death, they find out the  passion that he and Caroline had shared was stronger now then 12 years ago  when Rink left her behind.  And before Roscoe dies he lets known all the  secrets of his dirty scams that he was involved in and set up, and the  couple has to figure out where to go from there, now that they know the  truth.    Don't let the excerpt in the begining fool you. The book was  great from start to finish!  Just another of Sandra Browns masterpieces.	2000-06-04

The book starts with the setting and some back ground of the small town of Last Bend, then with a blink of an eye the book  moved into high gear never giving you time to think about putting the book  down.  A little boy sees his mom plundge to the ground off her horse and  learns to let his faith and love of his family bring his mommy back.  A  father learns that love and love alone can get a family through any trouble  you could face, and that honesty really is the best policy.  A girl growing  into a young adult, gets caught up in a whirl wind of what her life really  is, and whom she really is.  And a mom learns the differnce between love  and obbsession, how much wasted time and energy she had put on a young  womans childish dream and the reality of a grown adults true meaning of  love.  I cried, I laughed, I got angry... I was spun into this story that  melted my heart  and with all the pain that every one shared through this  trauma,I wanted every single character even Jullian True to be happy.I  would defiantly read this book again.  It never slowed down and every  detail was included not one thing was left out. Some books, once you get to  the end make you feel like they rushed to end the book,and then it was all  over and your left feeling like you have been asleep and you missed  something ... but in Angel Falls this is not the case, the book was a 5  star up till the last word.	2000-05-23
