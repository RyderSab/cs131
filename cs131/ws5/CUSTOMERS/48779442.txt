I gave this book to my non IT literate wife along with text books for the CompTIA Network+, i-Net+ and Server+ exams. Needless to say she passed all within three months and cited this as a core book.  You don't need a college degree to understand this book, you need a degree of intelligence - a different thing these days and sadly missing in the last review.  An excellent book.

READ ON	This is an excellent title and full of promise......unless and beware.  This book needs Adobe 6.0 Reader or better to view it.  When Adobe ever get their act together to fix the bugs in the 6.0 reader you might have some chance of reading it!  Unless of course you come across the restrictions on useage of the book.  For example no more than 50 pages to be printed in 30 days (I tried to print the book as a last resort)and the killer, use of the document on only one computer.  If you ned to transfer the document between machines you need to go through a proceedure over the Net to do so....and it does not work properly sometimes, its not safe.  I have now lost the use of this book between Adobe's terrible bugged reader and some foul up in the authorisation.  I can understand the protection of intellectual property rights etc etc but what happened to my rights to read the document I bought, I suppose its assumed I am some sort of potential fraudster just waiting to hi-jack a technical book that appeals to a small technical market, well you've got me lads, except I too am a victim, so the wrong guy.  I'll not be buying another PDF over the web until Adobe does something about its reader and this silly method of authorisation changes.  Don't bother, buy it on paper instead.  Technology shoots itself in the foot again, can you blame the ordinary users if they don't want to have anything to do with it.  That's right Adobe make us all look geeks!!!!    ***********    Editing this review on 23/04/2005 I was far too hard in respect of the material and the help that [...] gave me when I got into the mess over Adobe's rediculous reader.  The material is A1 and it's focus is getting you through the exam and the help [...] gave me in getting an unbugged version of the PDF was first class.  So forgetting Adobe NOW 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!	2004-07-27

Here is a much wanted entry level Exam (#TT0-101) for Voice Over IP and Convergence.  One of the &quot;new&quot; technologies embraced by Cisco and just about every other player in telecommunications.  A $99-00 exam that covers the basics of Internetworking, Telephony and IP Convergence.  A super Network+ if you like that even Cisco have no equivelent exam for, however they (Cisco) call it a &quot;stepping stone&quot; to their qualifications.  Next stop after here is CCNA and then VoIP Specialist, a clear track.  So what do Sybex do......cancel the book.  Where do they get the people who commission these books....their opponents maybe?  Something happened to Sybex about 2 years ago (2002) and the rot has still not stopped.  Ah happy days on the way to Chapter 11 -  bankruptcy that is!	2004-05-28

I am amazed at some reviews that appear on these pages.  A previous reviewer claims to have spotted numerous and repeated errors in this book.  If he knew that much before he read it why was he/she bothering? Plainly he had the measure of the exam already? Of course the review is virtually once again anonymous, I wonder why? The simple fact is that the claimed errors do not exist in such quantity although like in any technical book I have read there are some.  I can only conclude that once again by awarding one star and a few pithy remarks there is a clear effort to dump on a good book for reasons other than reality.  Don't be had, you can't do better at the price.  Five stars.	2004-03-27

Well if R2D2 had properly read and therefore reviewed this book he would have discovered that:<BR>1) It covers 3 exams.<BR>2) One of the exams is slightly more complicated than Network+ and is 50% of the CCNA Certification.<BR>3) That the other half of the CCNA qualification covers thru to specific Cisco related matters.<br />The book helps you either with the two stage approach to the CCNA Certification or the single exam.  Which ever way yo go to get your certification it covers both avenues.<br />Unless of course you are C3PO whom does not need to read or properly think what the book actually covers which is a bit of a pity since it tells you on the cover.

If Suresh had bothered to read the notes on the back of the book he would have found that &quot;officially&quot; they were recommended as &quot;part&quot; of the recommended learning path.  The mere fact that another reader found them all he needed says more about the state of preparedness of the other reviewer than the quality of the book.  So ignoring Suresh then there is actually nothing wrong with this offering from Cisco Press who on the whole don't do too bad a job.  You do need at least the DESGN text book and also I would suggest the Certification Guide as well as this is no push over of an exam.

Avoid this item!&quot;  writes a reviewer from Provo Utah (where?).  How on earth could this reviewer come to this conclusion.  Osmosis?  A mind-meld with with the question setters?  A week in a box with David Blane.  Based on this reviewer and his review I can tell that Provo Utah is awash with alien abductees.  Well can't I?  Another reviewer complains references to viruses and exploits etc being out of date.  Get a life, time, tide and technology waits for no man.  The top selling Firewall from Check Point has gone through three changes since this book was published.  Are you looking for a supplement to be mailed to you every week?  No, spoon feeding is what is wanted by some it appears.  &quot; Material is repeated verbatum several times over and the labs are the same in several chapters&quot;.  I'm not surprised that they have to repeat things, from the reviews printed here it will take a lifetime for the publishers to get some of the concepts in this book through to some buyers/reviewers.

A worthwhile read which as has already been said actually attempts to &quot;teach&quot; rather than just get you through the exam.  Recommended to the serious about certification.

Ron Gilster one of the authors and is well know in the Dummies books which tend to break down complicated subjects into managable bite size bits.  So it is with this book.<br />This book and its sister publication Wireless Security End to End (ISBN 0764548867), got me comfortable in a month before I tackled the CWNA Study Guide (ISBN 0072229020) and the CWSP Study Guide (ISBN 0072230126) from Planet 3.<br />Don't underestimate Wireless Lans when it comes to exam study, they are a different approach to networking that many a seasoned &quot;wired&quot; networking pro gets wrong.  Just look at how many insecure wireless Lans are out there giving the quickest way in to the heart of some of the most supposed secure networks.<br />This book and its sister publication are well worth the money and an easy introduction to the more involved studies ahead if you are certifiying.  If your not and just want to set up a SOHO setup or can't eat dinner without the laptop with you then this book will show you how to set a secure system up in a painless manner.

However very careful reading of the material will believe it or not provide you with the answers you seek.<br />Of course you should NEVER rely on one source to complete your exam studies but if your buying two, than make this one of them!	2003-11-20

Whatever opinion is expressed and from whatever quarter it cannot be denied that the CCNA is a benchmark exam in the world of IT certification.<br />I am very mystified by the last review as to how the reviewer gained so much knowledge from such an imperfect source to be so imbued with the technical knowledge to be critical to the level he has.  As to writing style that is of course a matter of taste.  The whole effect gives the impression of one of those alleged &quot;spoiler reviews&quot; which eventually get drowned in a sea of stars in a few months.<br />The CCNA exam has evolved as has the various study volumes and as any exam certification hopefull knows there is not one title that can contain it all.  The current CCNA exam needs at least two good sources of information beside the Cisco site, hands on or at the very least simulator experience and detailed study or experience to succeed.  Cisco Press is indeed an excellent source as well.  It has often amazed me how little outlay is expected in some quarters for such a prize certification considering that this exam can be the cornerstone of many an IT career not to mention futher Cisco qualifications, is a couple of books and a simulator so much???  Even if it is RouterSim!<br />If your serious about study instead of semantics then buy, read and study, study some more and get on!	2003-11-20

Before you even go to the errata page at Sybex just check that the book is all there. Mine wasn't and was missing 30 plus pages. With the extensive errata in hand then take your sissors and paste to transpose various diagrams onto the pages they are supposed to be on. What on earth was Sybex up to releasing this garbage. The technical content of the book is completely trashed by the incomprehensible and multiple mistakes. The author of this book has been terribly let down by the publishing house and should be howling for the blood of the proof readers. To expect the reader to go on a \\"do-it-yourself\\" re-publishing exercise with errata, pen, paper and glue in hand is the height of cheek. If this publishing house intends to prove it could not give a damn about its output then this is the book to do it. However they could prove that they care about their customers and authors by withdrawing all copies and republishing the book. As it stands it is not fit for the purpose that it was either intended for or purchased. I did like Sybex, I will be very careful in the future though.  Edited on 27/11/2002 Although I have complained now three times to Sybex UK and have been assured by the hapless UK staff that this has been passed on, complete silence from Sybex US.  I think the deafness says it all just stay with Cisco's offerings as I will have to.  KCH 27/11/2002.	2002-11-20

On the other hand if you had bothered to actually investigate what you were actually buying to study Citrix Metaframe XP you would not look here anyway because this book about CITRIX METAFRAME 1.8.....which is blindingly obvious if you look at the exam numbers or were to investigate the description and editorial review written on this very page.<br />The purpose of this book is to get you through the exams it talks about not the ones for Citrix Metaframe XP (which it never on any occassion states that it does).  This book does what it says is does in a five star way but of course you should...NEVER...rely on just one source for your studies.<br />To buy a book about one subject and to complain about it not covering another subject, and then to mark it down because you have made the mistake in buying it could make you look somewhat of a computerised fool who should not be allowed near a keyboard.  Apart from that its jolly bad manners, what!<br />If your doing the.....and I'll say this very slowly.....CITRIX METAFRAME 1.8 EXAM TRACK #1YO-910/920/930/940/950 then this book is a good and straight to the point read.  But beware its not about Cisco, its not about Novell its not about Cheeseburgers, Dolphins, Aliens or good old Mom and Apple Pie, its about....just simply, Citrix Metaframe 1.8.  Now I hope that's clear....to everyone......Caveat Emptor!!!!!	2002-09-16
