US	51940534	R2FK46MTN4IIBP	1400063833	97937991	Until I Find You: A Novel	Books	2	5	6	N	Y	John!  You let me down!	I've been a big Irving fan, pre-GARP.  I used to enjoy how he'd defend his earlier work when everyone was singing GARP'S praises.  He has since changed his approach, giving GARP credit for allowing him the financial freedom to have the luxury of time to invest in his books, allowing him the latitude to write the books he wants to write leisurely.  So, how does he explain this overblown exercise?  I became, sadly, bored by the hero's sex life before he had even turned 14. The world that tattoo artists occupy was much better realized in last year's THE ELECTRIC MICHAELANGELO (although I did like the phrase, \\"sleeping in the needles.\\")  But this is a week I will never get back again.  This also reminds of the later books of James Michener, which didn't show any sign of an editor's pencil.  Has Irving reached a point where his publishers' feel every word he writes is golden and worthy of inclusion?  This may have been a wonderful 200 page book, but it is a lousy one for 800 pages.	2005-08-25

I know people who consider themselves to be real \\"people people\\" who don't have half the pizzazz, power of intuitive observation and witty repartee that Liz has.  The \\"one Scrabble tile with nothing written on it\\" is actually the most valuable piece in the game, capable of making something out of almost anything.  This book is a joy -- well written and fun to read with a heroine you can't help but like and wonder about when the story ends.	2005-05-09

The writing and content is powerful, packed with haunting images and searing content.  On one level, it could be read as a thriller, taut and humid.  On another, it appears to be a parable of the repercussions left by apartheid, the inchoate attempts to right centuries of abuse.  The hospital, while continuing its administrative operations, with doctors doggedly showing up for duty and logging in rounds, lies indolent, barren and for the most part, unpopulated by the people it is meant to heal.  \\"Not even the seasons changed much.  We were too near the tropics for that.  There was a dry season & a rainy season, but the temperature that ran through them both didn't rise or fall too much on the chart.\\"    I saw Dr. Eloff's relationship with a native woman, whose true name he never does discover, as the white/native racial issue captured in mineature, his failure to win her over as too much too late.   The fact that he only knows her by an Anglicized name is indicative of the entire sequence of events which lead to their tragedy.	2005-05-07

It is unrealistic to believe a 279-pound man who hasn't lifted more than a Naragansett lager for 20 years would be able to hop on a bike, a Raleigh with no gears at that, and, fueled by bananas and tunafish, pedal from East Providence RI to Los Angeles.  But as the book unfolds, Smithy's story of his family and the tyranny that his beloved sister's schizophrenia wielded over all of their lives, we can see that there is no epiphany as much as there is unfolding of grief and realization that his increasing sense of freedom is thanks in large part to her death.   There is so much heart in this book, and so much sensuality even his adolescent attention to breasts is a reflection on his stunted life, which had not grown due to the constant attention necessarily imposed by his sister's condition.  There is inclusion of so much in the way of the senses, in particular smells - Worcestshire sauce, the various smells of the garage, the lilac and lemon, a wonderful combination).  Acute observations made me laugh out loud (a particular favorite was a statement about penguins).  This is definitely a book to savor.	2005-05-03

There are no rushed conclusions, no loose ends.  In addition, these \\"Swedish noir\\" police procedurals address matters more weighty than immediately apparent. This one in particular raises the question of whether or not a woman is capable of carrying out atrocious acts, for what ever reason.  The reader is made aware almost immediately that the killer is female. Mankell holds the question of the \\"why\\" until last, feeding information so adroitly that the suspense is as compelling as if it were being released at a more conventional pace.     Apt comparisons have been made to Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall.  The decision by that husband/wife team to only write 10 books has baffled their fans ever since the appearance of the last in their series, more than 30 years ago.  In this book in particular, there is internalizing on the part of not only Inspector Wallendar, but also the serial killer and to some degree the victims.  It's frustrating to know that there are so many of his works that have not been translated into English.	2005-04-14

We happened upon a reading by Mr. Robinson, and while the predominantly Berkeley-Oakland crowd all seemed very knowledgeable about his work, I was ashamed to say I'd never heard of him before serendipidously waundering into the store the very night he was visiting.  He was most gracious and recommended readers new to him to start with this book.  Meaty and well written with at least 3 stories going on at once, the book held my interest and went quickly.

Ever since reading Behind the Scenes at the Museum, I have been hoping to find a writer to match Kate Atkinson.  Some have come very close (Barbara Trapido, Hillary Mankell, Tom Perrotta).  Now comes Carole Cadwalladr.  She performs that most delicate of juggling acts -- keeping at least three stories spinning along, with each generation, each decade being presented in all its silliness.  As one reviewer pointed out, it helps to have lived in all the times depicted, which is one of the reasons why I can relate to the story so strongly.  I look forward to Cadwalladr's next book as eagerly as I anticipate future offerings from Atkinson, Trapido, and Mankell.	2005-03-10

The real topic of this book is not the devastating accident that galvinizes the family into grief, but the bi-polar affliction suffered by Cage and the family's attempts to deal with it.  It is particularly vivid to a reader who has not experienced this phenomenon either first- or second-hand.  The parts of the novel \\"narrated\\" by the mother are not as original or realistic, I would suppose because it is harder for a man to write in a woman's voice.  But Cage is a fascinating character; I'd like to know what happened to him after the book ended.	2005-03-04

In this case, I am definitely in the minority.  While I loved Mrs. Kimble for its originality and strong characterizations, I found the characters in this book to be pretty much cookie cutter.  I love books that return me to that comparatively innocent time of the 50s, but this one did not.  It felt forced and incompletely researched.	2005-02-24

As we \\"read\\" the book by listening to the cd, this did not present an issue.  In fact, it enhanced the experience.  Since we were listening to it together, we were much more aware of the laugh-out-loud humor it contained.  We are both avid readers, but thoroughly enjoyed the extra dimension that sharing this cd version afforded.  Mr. Prebble's reading is superb.  We recently \\"read\\" (thanks to Jim Dale) Books 4 and 5 of the Harry Potter series in this manner, and our enjoyment of those books led us to chose this cd.  Messrs. Prebble and Dale sound like they're having a whale of a time with the accents and voices these books contain.  Highly recommend.	2005-02-04

The heroine has many good attributes, including fierce loyalty and extreme warmth towards other characters.  It's unusual for a book of this type, told in first person with a female protagonist, to have been written by a man, and a young man at that.  The English seaside seems to hold an almost mythic importance for British writers.  This book and the Electric Michelangelo both take place in seaside towns, the combination of hope and decrepitude, almost a metaphor for unfulfilled wishes.  Also, this book is raw with vivid descriptions of sex.  Instead of being gratuitous, they enhance the characterizations.	2005-01-14

I expected so much from this book and purposely did not read any other customer reviews before picking it up.  This was highly disappointing.  The descriptions of life in 19th century Paraguay could have been gleaned from surfing the Internet, the characters were one-dimensional.  The style, episodic and random, was distracting, not original, if originality was the purpose.  I so wanted to like this book since I've been puzzled by the finalists the National Book Award has chosen lately.  But it did not deliver.	2005-01-12

Its inclusion on the Booker Award's long list is verification of that.  However, while the character of Sam, the father, is examined in detail, his son Jamie is a cypher and by the end is even more elusive.  Motivations which drive the action are hazy, making the plot spin off its center.  People acting against their type need more clarification.  Rare flashes of humor appear, usually involving peripheral action as central theme is grim.  I liked it, would recommend it, but still cannot give it a higher rating because of the inconsistency.	2005-01-11

You'll find yourself immersed, unable to get up to retrieve that next cup of coffee, resentful that you have to eventually get up to go into work or the john or anywhere that makes you exit this sensual world that Jordan has created.

Rosenfelt's first book was a pretty hard act to follow -- his experience as a screenwriter is evident.  This would be a great series for Dennis Leary.  I particularly liked the consistent references to sports which Rosenfelt has more than a passing knowledge of and which he has passed onto his character.  The mystery at the center of the book is not as compelling as that in the first book, but I look forward to reading the third and wait for more to come.	2004-11-15

I chose this book since it had made the long list and was one of the few available here from that list.  As revealed in other reviews, this is a classic story of abuse and denial, told time and time again, but has the ring of actuality about it.  The fact that the background is Nigeria and not a more familiar locale makes it even more compelling.  The revelation that this kind of abuse is prevalent in that corner of the world makes it all the more horrifying, plus the fact that part of the father's abuse is to deny his children access to his traditionalist father and heritage.  As another reviewer has remarked, I look forward to a sequel because these characters are so vivid, I want to know what happened to them once the book was finished.	2004-11-15
US	51940534	R2YGPJLUXLVB6E	0060540974	878066788	A Paper Life	Books	4	18	20	N	N	Honest spirit	Those of us who watched Ms. O'Neal grow up, from her seemingly charmed childhood through her glamorous marriage and into her stunning maturity will be shocked at the reality of her life.  Especially those of us who may have had shared experiences.  She observes herself and those around her with an eye that is cool and never calculating.  She addresses her problems with honesty and resilience, and those who have brutalized her and let her down have been given more than one chance to prove themselves. How ironic that abusive parents and spouses want to keep the horror \\"among ourselves\\" so that the world will only see them as charming, unaware of the disruption that resides in their core.  I do remember a review of Paper Moon in 1973, wherein the critic, unstinting in his praise for Tatum's performance, mused on whether or not the origin of her name was the jazz pianist Art Tatum (it was).  He went on to say he hoped so because even at 9, she showed she was as cool as her purported namesake.  I hope that critic is able to read this book and realize his assessment of the child has been realized in the woman.	2004-11-11

I burnt out on the genre back in the 70's, and haven't felt the need to return to it.  The front page of the newspaper has all the international intrigue I can handle.  But this wonderful book , with its indepth psychological insights and interwoven histories, had me wishing I could call in to work so I could keep reading.  It was given to me by someone whose taste I admire, so under his recommendation I gave it a shot. If it's possible, each section should be read (as all short stories should) in one sitting.  The continuity and suspense are masterfully handled.  Of particular interest is the reader's guide that follows the text which sheds illumination on the most potent section in the book.	2004-11-11

Effortless segues between modern labyrinthine MYST-like games and medieval mysteries, with enough intriguing characters and a very human protagonist, and as the narrative galloped toward the end, accelerating in suspense and menace, I kept noticing that there were far too many loose ends to be tied up and too few pages to do so (sorry about the mixed metaphors).  Authors should not tackle thrillers if they can't resolve them with satisfactory endings.  I thought I'd missed something, went back and read the last few pages.  Even thought my book may have lost some pages somehow.  But reading some of the other reviews, I realize that I hadn't missed anything.  There was nothing there to miss.	2004-10-22

His sensual descriptions of the city and its people bring the city to life.  The plight of the inner life of a street boy is poignantly realized, recalling the tragedy that unfolded in this year's fine documentary, Bus 174, which was more about the desperation of what it means to be a product of the streets, a sadly common phenomenon of Rio.  Espinosa, Garcia-Roza's protagonist, is reminiscent of Inspector Montalbano in Andrea Camilleri's Sicillian series.  Both have the same time worn quality, both love their food -- there are very sensuous descriptions of their meals, sometimes hilarious (as in Espinosa's consumption of a Big Mac on the Copacabana), but they both end up with answers to their puzzles and will hopefully expand on their experiences to us, their USA-bound fans.	2004-10-13

I discovered Sarah Bird thanks to amazon surfing, and marvel that I've never heard of her before.

Her encyclopedic knowledge of such a disparate range of topics makes every book of hers educational as well as fun to read.  In this third element of her seasonal tapestry, she addresses, among other things, a crisis of faith, the silent film era, the witness protection program, the psychology of the photographer, all set in a story filled with introspection from many points of view.  She also interweaves her previous plots (most notably, A Lover's Almanac), so that the stories gain a three dimensional aspect.  Highly recommend.	2004-09-20

Somehow it ended up on my recommendation list -- and this is one of the reasons I love \\"surfing\\" at amazon.  I won't bother to repeat the plot talking points that are rehashed in the other reviews, but will add that this book has the ring of truth to it.  Due to its subject matter, it could be said that it is reminiscent of Pat Conroy's \\"The Great Santini,\\" except that Bernie's father is a much shadowy figure, and the mother is a much stronger influence.  (Bird gives an acknowledgement to Conroy in the endnotes.)  I intend to look up her other books  -- she really is a great find.  Thanks, amazon.	2004-09-02

Maybe so, but the way he has them meet their cumuppances is one of the best things about his books, and where does he come up with those ideas?  He says it takes a lot of thought.  OK.  Everybody who should be punished, is.  In the most hilarious way imaginable.  And even the flawed hero doesn't always get off scott free.

Camilleri's village is fictitious, but his Inspector Montalbo is true to life.  He also likes to read international crime thrillers, savors fine food, and has a laughably volatile temper that can be aroused even if the day is windy.  There are episodes in this book that are truly hilarious, some that are horrific, and several that are sad.  A good mix.  And we're always anxious to see what has been left for his dinner in the refrigerator.  Like the Ladies' No. 1 Detective Agency series, this series in its entirety presents a portrait of an unforgettable way of life in a specific place with a person I'd like to spend some time with.	2004-09-01

The review amazon has pegged as their \\"Spotlight\\" review misses the point if this is the first of his books that they have read.  His stories are more character driven than plot driven; they are more instrospective, moody, atmospheric, and for me, they never fall short.

The portraits of these women are drawn with such accuracy I feel I could provide their true names, including my mother.  Since she still lives there with her cronies from her youth, husbands and children either gone or scattered, through these stories I have a truer insight into her life than I have gotten from the weekly telephone conversations we share.

Twenty years ago, it was Donald Westlake (Dancing Aztecs, for instance), and so I'm constantly on the lookout for writers capable of creating that elusive hybrid of humor and thriller.  Ben Elton falls into this category, although sometimes his books tend to run on a bit.  Danny King fills a particular niche.  So, all that being said, I cannot believe it's taken me this long to discover Bill Fitzhugh.  Although the reader comes away from this book with far more knowledge about entomology that they'd bargained for, the story is fast, the characters believable, and the humor sharp.

Every one of her books resonates with wonderful plots and characters, yet I find I have to special order many of them from the UK.  This one, possibly her most personal, follows the young life of a girl in Durban, South Africa, during the implementation of apartheid.  Being blessed by having enlightened parents and, as her father puts it, strong abstract reasoning, Dinah is appalled at the injustices imposed by the apartheid system.  This shameful history is documented here in prose that is understandable, warm and sometimes humorous.  Her experiences at her different schools, relationships with the various girlfriends and (later) men she meets, and her truly original family are presented with three-dimensional clarity.  When as an adult she leaves for England, she finds she loves her new home, can remember with affection but not longing the positives of her childhood home, but is especially glad that \\"public holidays are called bank holidays because they aren't commemorating an endless succession of brutal events in which white persons w/gunpowder have laid waste to brown persons w/spears.\\"	2004-08-27

Novels about Hollywood which feature actual personalities are rarely successful, no matter how much insider knowledge is involved.  I found that I couldn't finish it, even though I had less than 50 pages left to go.  Life is too short.	2003-08-12

There is something intriguing about Australia, almost a mirror image of the United States but dramatically different.  As in Dermot Bolger's &quot;Father's Music,&quot; the music metaphor and its connection to the people in the story makes it almost a character in itself.  The descriptions of the land are so vivid, you almost feel the dust in your throat.  But what made this book soar for me was its ruminations on the nature of love.  Not romantic love, but love warts and all -- the lost love of a man for his family, the lessening of love between a man and a woman, the complicated love a woman feels for her own highly dysfunctional siblings.  I recommend this book, without any reservation.	2002-07-03

Exceptional...Luminous...Lyric...opens up ordinary-looking doors...Ms. Azzopardi has woven a story that we've read before, but the result is fresh and original.  She has also managed to create wonderful thumbnail character studies, with each daughter in this family having a distinct identity.  Stripped to the essence, yet flowing in detail, the book is filled with repressed memories, some which rise, and others which are too painful to surface.	2002-04-03

It would have been much more compelling if it had been stripped down a bit.  The characters were initially interesting, but as the book wore on and on (and on and on), their cookie cutter personalities were too thin to hold up the structure.  Also, but setting this story in a relatively remote setting, the plot's secrets could be detected too soon.	2002-04-03

I also found myself Googling on the Internet to learn more about Apert's Syndrome, the Broken Column (and other follies of 18th Century France), and the difference between labyrinths and mazes.  The novel itself could be said to be either, but I would classify it a maze since it does have &quot;tricks,&quot; &quot;false leads&quot; and a reward to be had at the end.  And it definitely does not end at the same place that it begins.	2002-02-15

Back then, I read for sensationalism.  In the ensuing years, like my body,  my reading tastes have matured.  This book in particular, with its wonderful take on a certain society at a certain point in history, should be read by anyone interested in the modern novel.  Way ahead of its time -- astounding that it was published in 1934.	2002-01-25

Is she privy to more hours in the day, more days of the week, than the rest of us?  It would be an accomplishment for a person to create one book in their lifetime of the caliber of this one, but she comes out with at least a book a year, sometimes more than one.  And in this case, a page turner, compelling and informative and wise.  With a little mystery thrown in.  She never fails to be interesting.	2002-01-25

The heroine is smarter, her friends are smarter, even her put-downs are smarter.  It is also a love story, of a daughter for her mother.  An appreciation of the influence parents and background had for her.  And how she has adapted them into her life. It's a shame that this book may be swept under the rug and ignored in favor of other books that receive more publicity.  A real sleeper.	2002-01-25

Pearson departs the style that made him a favorite of mine, reminiscent of sitting on a porch with a glass of tea, listening to a series of raconteurs spinning yarns and gossip.  His previous books, all set in the same imaginary County, flowed in a honeyed stream, causing more than one bursts of laughter.  Now this more conventional yet totally original book has surfaced.

But there is so much wealth of detail and much to ponder in its pages.  One of my most indelible criteria is that I must care about the characters in a book, want to know more about them after the story is over.  When I began this, the hero was someone I wasn't prepared to like as much as I did at the end.  Wish I knew him and what had become of him.	2001-07-26

The only thing that kept me going was &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; which I read in that one sitting.  Later, I picked up his other books, thinking that the circumstances under which I fell in love with &quot;Fool&quot; may have enhanced my appreciation, but only found that his writing, clear, humorous, empathetic and true, is evidenced in all his books.  Culminating in this last, wonderful book.  Which leads me to ponder:  why is it there are writers who just crank out page after page, book after book, and you simply don't care if they never write another word.  And then there is Richard Russo, who you wish could find another 8 hours a day so he could give us a book a year.  (Michael Chabon is another.)	2001-07-03

The  prose, the images, the timeless energy of the story and writing got my  reading muscles working again.  Since I live in Oakland and work in SF, the  images of those cities written 50 years ago give a fresh, vibrant  perspective.  Characters come alive, flawed and real.  A plot that  pulsates.	1999-07-04

I'd seen Charlie Rose interview the author, became intrigued, and bought this book in hardcover, breaking one of my cardinal  rules.  After 400 pages of snide media references and product placements,I  gave up, realizing that the characters were too steeped in their cliches to  become 3 dimensional, and if any plot were to develop this late in the  game, it would not be worth it.

Never has life in rural Kentucky been more searingly told.  Judy's transition from tomboy is real, and our own  lives' disappointments and grinds seem frivilous next to the struggles  these people live with daily.  However toward the end of the book, one  character tells what he loves about his life and where he lives, and the  beauty of the area comes alive.  The smells and sounds of rural living.	1999-03-20

Her attention to detail, characterizations, interweaving of mysticism and reality -- and  with all, an original dash of humor laced with sadness.  As with Burning  Tales of Love, she weaves many disparate threads together, creating a  narrative blanket that you never want to unwrap from.  I've read everything  she's written, and in this day when prizes such as the National Book Award  mean so much in sales and recognition, it amazes me that her work isn't at  least among the finalists.	1999-01-29
