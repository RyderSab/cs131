This time, at the behest of the Mossad, he is off through Southeast Asia stalking black market arms dealer Manheim Levi.  By now longtime Rain devotees are as familiar with his modus operandi and his obsession for detail as they are with author Barry Eisler's taut, crisp and compelling penmanship.  None of this subtracts one iota from this being another terrific John Rain novel.  Sensual femme fatale Delilah returns as does Rain's alter-ego associate Dox.   The trio makes for an unorthodox but effective (and entertaining) team as they pursue the completion of their assignment.  A slightly different slant in this fourth novel.    I will echo previous reviewers' lament that, after reading \\"Killing Rain\\" so quickly, it seems a long wait until Eisler writes the fifth Rain novel next year.  But enjoy this one for now, it's another great read.	2005-08-31
US	51868459	R8QXZOX5BHQ93	1573222453	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Something Very Special	A brilliant, brilliant first novel by author Khaled Hosseini whose stunning prose tells the heartfelt and heart-wrenching story of Amir, a privileged boy who grows up in Kabul, escapes to America after the Russian invasion and returns after the brutal Taliban takeover.  From this we learn of a young boy struggling to win his father's recognition, his later betrayal and his ultimate search for redemption.  It is within this context that Hosseini vividly depicts a country of extraordinary contrasts - a barren land of vast beauty and tragic turmoil, a people divided by wealth and race, and a culture clinging to ancient traditions in a modern world.  But it is also within this context that Hosseini poignantly paints a very human face of the Afghani people - a face that the Western world seldom sees and rarely understands.    The \\"Kite Runner\\" is a stunning novel that will resonate within the reader long after the final page has been turned.  Absolutely one of the top must-read novels on anyone's list.	2005-08-31

Yet little else is known about him or the subjects that he chose to paint.  In this fictional tale author Tracy Chevalier brings to life that mysterious model for the Girl with the Pearl Earring.  It is through her eyes and voice that we learn about the enigmatic Vermeer and about 17th century Dutch culture.    This simple yet absorbing storyline flows seamlessly under Chevalier graceful penmanship. In this tautly written novel, Chevalier creates a cast of intriguing characters - the cold and stoic Vermeer, his emotionally fragile and volatile wife Catharina, the powerful matriarch Maria Thins, the lecherous patron van Ruijven and the modest yet radiant Griet.   It is through these characters that Chevalier creates the intriguing premise for how that Vermeer masterpiece came to be.  A thoroughly wonderful and highly recommended read.	2005-07-02
US	51868459	R29ZAEK2ZF5SON	0385492510	409245980	Gates of Fire	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Exciting and Insightful	Great re-creation of the epic Battle of Thermopylae but and even better look into what created the Spartan warriors who steadfastly stood and died against an overwhelming force of Persian invaders.  Not only does author Steven Pressfield  thrillingly narrate the battle spectacles but he also does a masterful job of creating compelling fictional storylines behind those heroes.  Undoubtedly readers will be left inspired by the names of Leonidas, Dienekas, Alexandros, et al as representations of true courage and true commitment to ideals.      As with his other works, Pressfield does not fail to entertain with his fictional military history.  The depth and breath of his writing puts the reader in the very midst of the action and in the minds of each warrior.  Equally noteworthy is the manner in which Pressfield captures the essence of ancient Greek and Persian culture.  An excellent book for the action-oriented reader.	2005-06-21

Two things are a certainty about author Stephen Hunter: 1) he knows his guns; and 2) he knows how to write fast-paced, action-oriented, plot-twisting thrillers.  Anyone who is not yet familiar with master sniper Bob Lee Swagger will soon be.    This time the loner Bob Lee Swagger is coaxed out of retirement to perform one last service for his country - to assassinate a would-be assassin before he can complete his contract.  But nothing is as straight-forward as it appears to be.   And somewhere along the line Swagger is forced to reluctantly team with FBI agent Nick Memphis in order to unravel the series of events.  But no spoilers here.  Read \\"Point of Impact\\" and you'll guarantee yourself one thrilling ride.	2005-06-06
US	51868459	RHOAKCNLRFHI3	0452283728	327544421	If I Never Get Back	Books	5	6	7	N	N	One Of The Best	Baseball addicts, casual sports fans and non-sports fans alike will enjoy reading this highly entertaining work by author Darryl Brock.  This has to be one of the best fictional sports books ever.  It certainly is my favorite and one which I've enjoyed re-reading during spring training.  The variant backdrops - time displacement, political conspiracy, historical characters, love affairs and, oh yes, baseball - will keep every reader totally engaged.    The basic story begins when protagonist Sam Fowler steps off a modern day Amtrak train and finds himself transported back into 1869 where he becomes involved with, amongst many other things, the legendary Cincinnati Red Stockings.  But in this era baseball is in its infancy.  The game, the rules and the players are not the same as today.  Just how Fowler manages to cleverly integrate the modern game with its colorful past is but one of the many intriguing storylines in this wonderful novel.  Throw in a couple of gamblers, treasonous villains and romantic love interests and you pretty much have something for everyone.    \\"If I Never Get Back\\" is a captivating fast-paced book that shouldn't disappoint any avid reader.  It's no fluke that the vast majority of Amazon.com reviewers give it their 5-star rating.  Highly recommended for a great summer read.	2005-06-05

Author Ann Patchett's arresting prose is both graceful and mesmerizing as she recounts the tragic circumstances of political hostages taken by a group of South American terrorist.    In the midst of this potentially hostile and volatile situation comes the most unlikely of developments.  Above the chaos arises beauty and compassion.  Divided by language, class and culture the diverse group of hostages and captors become one when captivated by the incredibly beautiful singing voice of American opera diva Roxanne Coss.  From this common ground the group begins to develop a sense of understanding, empathy and feelings for each other.  But all actions have consequences - both good and bad.      Ann Patchett's handling of the characters is masterful.  She creates a truly unique group of characters - Roxanne Coss, Mr. Hosogawa, Gen, Reuben Iglesias, Carmen, Simon Thibault, et al - each with their unique persona and unique background.  Yet Patchett doesn't overreach or overwrite with any one person.  If fact, there truly is no central character.  Instead, she creates a number of individuals who we come to empathize with and embrace.  Just superb.    For readers who appreciate great writing, \\"Bel Canto\\" should not be missed.	2005-06-01

I'll admit to being somewhat indifferent to the history of World War I.  But the manner in  which author Jeff Shaara presents it had me engrossed in the exploits of Baron von Richthofen, Black Jack Pershing, Raoul Lufbery, Roscoe Temple and all of his other central figures. Shaara's detail of the battles in both the skies and the trenches vividly depicts the truly horrific nature of that war.  Contrasted to the heroic feats of the soldiers Shaara also relates the incompetence, the narrow-minded nationalistic agendas and the blinding ego-driven ambitions of some of the military and political leaders that contributed to the tragic deaths of ten million men.  Fascinating reading.    Shaara fans and new readers alike won't be disappointed by this one.  Score this book another 5-stars.	2005-05-27

The storyline flows seamlessly and the tremendous battle scenes, told through the eyes and voice of Alexander the Great himself, unfold in all their chaotic grandeur.  Battles aside, Alexander's memoirs - his upbringing and his rise to power - are fascinating.  Trained to be a soldier and a warrior his memoirs reflect a man who is most restless when ruling an empire but is most alive when leading an army into battle. As a warrior-king he is a man of extremes - compassionate and utterly ruthless, forgiving and uncompromisingly vengeful.  Ultimately, Alexander is shown as a man, much like Ahad, who is obsessively driven in pursuit, not of a great white whale, of conquest itself.      \\"The Virtues of War\\" is a terrific read about one of the greatest military geniuses in history.	2005-05-23

These four individuals - Dina, Maneck, Ishvar and Om - come from different backgrounds and different castes but find themselves living in the same small flat.  In India, where existence cannot be taken for granted, survival becomes the ultimate goal.  It is through this common goal that these four disparate individuals forge a sense of understanding and compassion for each other.     For those not familiar with India's history, Mistry reflects an India with an oppressive caste-system, with corrupt governmental and judicial systems, and with cities filled with wretched poverty.  Yet through this morass Mistry also shows the adaptability, the compassion and the incredible will of the people who survive through it all.     A Fine Balance should be one of those must-read books on your list.  It is an absolutely captivating and magnificent read.	2005-05-23

Read every word (I think they were words).  Much like running a marathon a lot pain was involved along the way.  However, also like a marathon that pain was replaced by a tremendous sense of relief and accomplishment when it was over.  The end of the novel became my quest, my obsession - just like Ahab's white whale.<br /><br />Can't tell you what \\"Finnegans Wake\\" was about because I can't even pretend that I understood it.  For me, \\"Finnegans Wake\\" was more of a one-of-a-kind experience than it was a traditional read.  Most of the time I kept thinking what kind of a mind creates this style, this language, this alternate reality?  There were times that I thought I almost grasp something but that something quickly evaporated much like a phantom or a hallucination.  Though I didn't understand it I can't say that \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is without merit.  It has endured too long and has sparked too much debate to be rendered insignificant.  Frankly, I enjoy reading the wildly diverse opinions/analysis/commentaries on Amazon.com more than I did the book.  And that is why I gave \\"Finnegans Wake\\" a 4-star rating.	2005-01-30

This time protagonist Robert Langdon is called upon to unravel a legendary secret society, the Illuminati, in order to solve a bizarre murder and recover a capsule of incredibly powerful antimatter.  Dan Brown skillfully blends in a lot of mysterious religious history and modern science into this fictional tale.

Eight hundred thousand Rwandans hacked to death with machetes within 100 days is difficult to fathom let alone forget.  But the apathy reflected by the international community will continue to remind everyone of the difference between a poor black African nation and a European or a rich Arab nation.  This was aptly illustrated when author Phillip Gourevitch visited the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC.  As the museum staffers walked by with buttons proclaiming \\"Remember\\" and \\"Never Forget\\" Gourevitch was reading the local newspaper which contained pictures of bloated Rwandan corpses clogging a stream.  How easy it seemed for the American psyche to disassociate the two events.   Sadly, when you read Major General Dalliare's (in charge of the UN troops there) comments you realize how little it would have taken to prevent the entire tragedy.    This is a must-read book.  It is well written and will hit you like a sledgehammer.	2005-01-22
US	51868459	R1YP5LYJ9YEN2K	0385336411	324813991	Autumn Bridge	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Great, Great Sequel	Anyone who has enjoyed author Takashi Matsuoka's \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" will be completely blown over by his second novel, \\"Autumn Bridge.\\"  It's not too often that an author creates a sequel that surpasses the first. \\"Autumn Bridge\\" does exactly that and will keep you `til the wee hours of the early morning reading it.      \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" was largely the story of Lord Genji in the 1860's - his prophecy, his ascent to power and his relationship with a young American missionary, Emily Gibson.  Intertwined was also the story of Matthew Stark, a vengeance seeking American gunslinger.  Though the second novel continues with these characters, \\"Autumn Bridge\\" elaborates more on the history of the Okumichi clan and the prophecies that guided their destiny. And it is within this context that we are introduced into the hauntingly mysterious Lady Shizuka.   Just a masterfully told tale woven in a past-with-present style.     In \\"Autumn Bridge\\", Matsuoka toned down some of the salaciousness and graphic violence (which some readers criticized) found in his earlier work.  I thought this was an improvement since the focus was more on the intriguing storyline.  Still evident, though, were the fast moving plot and ever mysterious far eastern feudal intrigue.  Great read.  \\"Autumn Bridge\\" will not disappoint.	2005-01-22

The grisly murder of a prominent mandarin by a mysterious ghoul provides the catalyst for this duo to go delving into China's ancient mythology searching for the answers.  Along the way, author Barry Hughart creates some of the most curious and imaginative heroes and villains you will ever encounter.  Just superb.    Sadly, as noted by previous reviewers, this is the third and last book that the author has written in this series.

I wanted to enjoy it but just couldn't (but I also didn't hate it).  Author Dave Eggers is obviously a very talented writer but this particular book just never resonated with me. I may have gotten off on the wrong foot when I read the preface \\"Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book\\".   I suppose it may have been intended to be somewhat clever but it struck me as being corny.   And perhaps that stayed in the back of my mind i.e. this book endeavors to be more tritely clever than a serious work.    The true story of Dave Eggers raising his kid brother after the passing of both his parents is not a unique story but one which may be dealt with in many different ways.  While there were some heartfelt moments Eggers doesn't seem to follow through with them.  But perhaps that wasn't his intent.  Eggers does have a writing style that is somewhat curious to me.  I thought it drifted quite a bit.  Also, Eggers seemed to get closely personal in some passages while distancing himself in others.  In some ways, Eggers reminded me of David Foster Wallace and Neal Stephenson - fellow authors who overwrite and tend to lose the sentiment or thrust of the moment.      I am not trying to be overly critical of this book.  I just could never get in sync with Eggers's writing which frustrated me.  I so looked forward to reading this acclaimed work and had such high expectations.  I may have been disappointed but many others were not.  Worth reading just to be able to judge for yourself.	2004-12-27

What eye-opening insights it provides into our human ancestry.  As rapidly as scientific knowledge is expanding today the race to keep abreast of what we think we know about ourselves and our civilization is an ongoing battle.  I'll admit that I was astonished to learn that all living humans today can be traced back to a single African female (circa 200,000 years ago) and a single African male (circa 60,000 years ago).  After all, none of this was ever taught to me in high school or college.  But I was more fascinated to learn how recently science has been able to utilize mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome to create the roadmap back to these origins. And I was equally fascinated by Spencer Wells' explanation as to how man subsequently migrated out of Africa, populated our known world and evolved into today's distinct cultures.      How accurate is The Journey of Man?  I couldn't say since I am neither schooled in the study of genetics nor scientifically inclined.  But I can appreciate that Spencer Wells wrote this book in a manner that is easily understandable to the layperson like me.  And in doing so, he stimulated my interest and made me want to read more about this subject.  And any book that has this effect has to rate 5-stars.	2004-12-26

Through this chance meeting a friendship between them develops. Craine learns that Tsung Tsai, a Buddhist monk, had escaped from the Chinese Red Army in 1959 by crossing 3,000 miles of famine-plagued China.  40 years later Tsung Tsai convinces Craine to join him on his one last mission in life - to return to China and Mongolia to find the bones of his Buddhist master and to bury them in a shrine in his honor.  What ensues is a story of that incredible quest.     As remarkable as this true tale is, it's Craine's firsthand narrative that keeps this book so alive.  As a part-time poet he adeptly captures Tsung Tsai's delightful tone and syntax.  Moreover, he reveals the remarkable spiritual effect that Tsung Tsai has upon the people that he touches.  I thought that \\"Bones of the Master\\" had an excellent blend of writing and adventure that made it a 5-star read and a 5-star adventure.	2004-12-17

That's what happened to the unfortunate survivors of the shipwrecked Dutch trading vessel Batavia in 1629.   But this is no grisly blood-n-guts accounting.  Nothing that would appall the squeamish. Instead, author Mike Dash gives a fascinating insight as to the behavior of people who are suddenly thrust into a desperate life-and-death situation.  Interesting that psychopathic leader Jeronimus Cornelisz begins with a twisted rationale for initiating the slaughter of innocent survivors.   On a desert atoll with limited provisions, the deaths are meant to cull the users of those life-sustaining provisions.  However, as time passes the killings continue out of boredom and bloodlust.  Just an amazing account of survival, courage and rescue.  \\"Batavia's Graveyard\\" is an absolutely gripping read.	2004-12-03

I thought I would give it another shot to see if time and age had changed my perspective.  Well, sort of.  I had always liked the basic storyline - that of Ahab's relentless pursuit of the great white whale and how (his) obsession, taken to extreme, ultimately destroys.   But there were still a few things that kept me from fully appreciating \\"Moby Dick\\" as a great novel.    I am still not a big fan of Melville's writing style.  I found his writing to be erratic - very slow in some sections then very rapid in others. And the manner in which he switches from Ishamel's first-person narrative to third-person narrative was somewhat awkward.  Then throw in a couple of chapters that are scripted like a stage play and you have a book in which I could not find any true cadence.  I found myself battling (then and now) through the chapters futilely trying to get into a flow where the pages would just sweep me along.    Secondly, as noted, many chapters were devoted to describing the whaling industry and the whales in great detail.  I understand that in Melville's time it was common to write novels that educated as well as entertained.  But the extent to which Melville elaborated in those chapters really disrupted the storyline's momentum which had to be kick-started in later sections.  The transition from a fictional narrative to a lengthy non-fictional discourse was a little too stark.    Finally, Ishmael's/Melville's continual philosophical meanderings were somewhat stretched.  As Ishamel stands upon the mast-head relating the operations of whaling with the whole history of mankind or when during a thunderstorm Melville draws parallels between the unrest in nature with the unrest on the Pequod.....well, those seemed to be a bit of an overreach.    There was much about \\"Moby Dick\\" that I liked and there is much about this Melville work to be admired but I still found it to be a labor to read.   Better the second time around.  For me, \\"Moby Dick\\" is good novel but one in which I could not find greatness.	2004-12-02

A young and insecure Emi discovers that her powerful politician husband, Taku Imura, has become so smitten by the stunningly beautiful geisha, Hana, that he purchases her freedom and starts a second family with her.  Interesting but unremarkable.  But as the storyline developed I became much more deeply involved with the characters - especially that of Emi's son, Jun, and Hana's daughter, Yumi.  Through them we see a Japan emerging from a feudal society into the 20th century where customs and ideals clash as Japan and the Japanese people try to find their global identity.  Interesting how the unfaithful Taku and the conniving Hana ultimately become sympathetic figures as they represent the traditional Japan that is so rapidly vanishing.      The advent of World War II and the aftermath of the A-bomb is an exceptionally powerful section of the book.  Author Hiroko Sherwin poignantly shows its shattering impact upon the three generations of the Imura family who lose their ideals, their way of life and their lives to these tragic events.  Great finish to a wonderful book.	2004-11-28

The Company is a 24th century enterprise that travels through time, rescues persons from the past and makes them immortal.  These immortals are subsequently assigned to specific periods in history with the purpose of preventing life (plants, animals, etc) from becoming extinct and preserving them for the future.  Mendoza is one such immortal.  Rescued from the Spanish Inquisition she is trained as a botanist and is assigned to 16th century England to collect rare herbs from the garden of Walter Iden (hence the book's title).  Once there she breaks one of the Company's rules by falling in love with a mortal named Nicholas.  And therein lies the problem with the book.  The storyline then turns from sci-fi into a basic romance novel that could have taken place anywhere, at any time without a sci-fi setting.  Disappointing.  Author Kage Baker seemed to have had good thing going but didn't follow-through on her original concept.  Ms Baker writes well but I would be hard pressed to want to read another one of her Mendoza sci-fi novels.  Three stars, though, for an original idea and for her writing.	2004-11-28

I was a little surprised that this novel was not so much a courtroom thriller than it was about a 23-year old newspaperman, Willie Traynor, who covers a horrific murder trail involving of the town's more unsavory citizens.   Therein, most of the storyline takes place outside of the courthouse.      While I didn't find \\"The Last Juror\\" to be as tautly written (suspense-wise or action-wise) as some of Grisham's earlier works  I did find that it still had much of elements that made me a follower of his works.  His intriguing storyline, his wry humor and his endearing treatment of his characters were still evident.

Author Edwidge Danticat brilliantly weaves a series of stories that reveal much about Haiti during the era of the Duvaliers.  But \\"The Dew Breaker\\" is not so much about Haiti as it is about the Haitian people, both the perpetrators and the innocents, of that brutal Duvalier regime.  Danticat's simple arresting prose is dead-on as she so vividly and intensely relates the depth of human emotions of these tragic victims.  Brilliant is the way Ms Danticat intertwines the stories of these individuals who find themselves in the same New York City neighborhood many years later living lives of haunted memories and deep remorse.        The Today Show Book Club got it right again.  \\"The Dew Breaker\\" is another highly recommended read.	2004-11-08

Sure, the appeal of the charismatic assassin, John Rain, and the allure of the sensual femme fatale, Delilah, has that certain seductive quality that immediately hooks the reader.  And sure, it's Eisler's taut, crisp writing style that keeps the action moving in a seamless manner.   And the exotic locations don't hurt either.  But it's also Eisler's ability to place the storyline in an interesting sociopolitical context that keeps the reader thinking and so engrossed in \\"Rain Storm\\" and his other novels.    It's not a fluke that \\"Rain Storm\\" and the John Rain series has received so many 5-star ratings.  They are simply that deserving.  Anyone who hasn't done so has to get caught up on this terrific series.	2004-10-03

When I finally got around to it (years later) my only regret is that I waited so long to enjoy this terrific book.  I'll admit to having a certain affinity for sci-fi and thus found the entire premise of \\"Ender's Game\\" to be entertaining.  Ender Wiggin is one of many child geniuses genetically bred to command the world's military armada against alien invaders.  In Battle School these children are trained through an arduous series of stimulated mock battle games where only the best and ablest can succeed.  But Ender Wiggin is no ordinary trainee.  He is thought to be the one who may become the ultimate commander who will bring final victory over the aliens.  And, of course, all the while Ender is going through his training sinister and benevolent forces work relentlessly behind the scenes to thwart and support his efforts.    In addition to this engaging storyline, author Orson Scott Card touches upon several thought-provoking themes: the yearning for a childhood lost; the psychological fear and loneliness of command; the morality of exterminating an alien race; and, ultimately, how the inability to communicate led to catastrophic consequences.  I especially liked the ending where Ender and the readers are left to contemplate the morality and humanity of this war.  Not a heavy read but a thoroughly enjoyable one.	2004-09-27
US	51868459	RUM36GM8G1181	0316155306	561654368	The Narrows	Books	5	6	6	N	N	On The Mark Again	Oh hum, another terrific Michael Connelly novel.  But this should come as no surprise to those who have been following his work and his Harry Bosch series.  This time Bosch teams up with FBI agent Rachel Walling to pursue a serial killer first introduced in a prior novel \\"The Poet.\\"  If you enjoyed \\"The Poet\\" then you should be pleased to know that none of that book's momentum has been lost in this sequel.  Though not an absolute prerequisite, it's probably best to read \\"The Poet\\" first since it more fully develops the killer's character and thus the background alluded to in \\"The Narrows\\" becomes more understandable.  For a synopsis read through the previous reviewers who have done a terrific job on the overview.    One of the things I like about Connelly is the way in which he continually recycles his characters.  A minor character with just a passing mention in one book becomes a major character in another and vice versa.  That gives a feeling of great familiarity as one reads through his series of novels.      Great plot, great suspense, great writing. And, oh yes, another great Connelly read.	2004-09-17

This is no doubt an important novel because it deals with one of the unique complexities of slavery - black slave ownership.  As he tells of the Townsend saga from slavery to freedom to prosperity to decline author Edward P. Jones paints a vivid landscape of time and characters.      I enjoyed \\"The Known World\\" though I had to work very hard to get there.  I had difficulty getting into sync with Jones' narrative style.  Perhaps it was the number of characters he kept introducing or perhaps it was his constant shifting of time that kept me off balance.  But I was never able to get into a flow where the pages just swept me along.  However, in the end the novel did succeed in touching a range of human emotions and capturing the feel of that turbulent period of American history.  And that made the effort worthwhile.	2004-09-15

And deliver he did.  I thought \\"Hard Rain\\" was as good if not better than \\"Rain Fall.\\"  Excellent complex plot with the requisite twists and double-dealings.  Great, great heavy action sequences.  But those are not the hooks that keep you riveted to the book.  It's protagonist John Rain himself that keeps you so enthralled.   John Rain is that enigmatic hitman who lives as a shadow figure blending inconspicuously into Japanese society until his specialized services are upon by both government agencies and underworld enterprises alike.   John Rain, who has both the technical skills to make his hits look like natural causes and the martial arts skills to brutally vanquish rivals in a dojo.  Throughout this novel Eisler has you racing and breathing that exotic and alluring Japanese atmosphere.  \\"Hard Rain\\" is a very polished and  provocative action novel.  I loved it.	2004-09-07

A thought provoking book, yes, but one whose philosophical message gets blurred by the weight of author Ayn Rand's own writing.    Dagny Taggart and John Galt are intriguing characters.  However, everyone else is either very good and brilliant or very evil and dim-witted.  I can understand why Ms Rand did this but that polarization became so extreme that the characters became ridiculous and thus greatly diminished Ms Rand philosophical thrust.    \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is generally predicated on the concept that in a deteriorating society those who are most capable of saving it would choose to withdraw and allow the system to fail.  Perhaps this is a direct result of Ms Rand's own personal Russian experiences.  However, in this society the captains of industry rise, confront and prevail.  I understand that this is a fictional work but not buying into the book's premise made the novel difficult to connect with.    Lastly, I had a problem with Ms Rand's need to constantly drive home her message and philosophy by relentlessly repeating them.  The sheer number of those redundancies became exceedingly tiresome and contributed greatly to the book's 1,168 pages.    Overall, I liked the novel and am I glad that I read it.  But despite all of the critical acclaim \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" has received I still could not connect with it being considered one of the greatest novel ever.	2004-08-20

But \\"Ahab's Wife\\" is less of tale of events and more a tale of a young woman's spiritual journey.  So readers should not expect a twist-turning plot or cliff-hanging suspense.  Rather the reader should expect a creative tale richly told.      I would have given \\"Ahab's Wife\\" 5-stars but I thought author Sena Jeter Naslund's prose was a little heavy-handed.  I just feel that written prose should be like perfume where a little is intriguing but a lot becomes overpowering.  I thought Ms Naslund's prose-rich writing made for a rather slow read.  Enjoyable but slow.  If you have the time \\"Ahab's Wife\\" would make a rewarding effort.	2004-08-20

The book just flew by.  At the end I felt like I had just taken a terrific ride and immediately started looking for the next Connelly novel I could get my hands on.<br /><br />This time it's newspaperman Jack McEvoy who begins probing the circumstances surrounding his policeman brother's death.  Unwilling to accept it as an official suicide, McEvoy's persistent inquiries begin to uncover an oblique pattern that hints at a serial killer.  Joining forces with law enforcement officials McEvoy assists in the manhunt for this killer, dubbed The Poet, before he can kill his next victim.<br /><br />Superbly told, the manhunt becomes a fast-paced psychological thriller that will keep you riveted until the end.	2004-08-09

Everyday people struggling to survive in the decaying town of Empire Falls may not make the most promising beginning of a storyline.  But author Richard Russo's remarkable writing makes the story and the characters so alive and so endearing in the midst of tragedy and despair that the book simply sparkles.      Miles Roby, proprietor of the local diner, is the central character around whom all of the secondary characters revolve around.  His cynical teenage daughter, his confused ex-wife, his colorful father, his high school friends who have all settled into various jobs in Empire Falls, et al.  These are all people we have met and known in real life.  People who started out with high ambitions only to find themselves ultimately back home continuing the legacies of their parents.  But this book is not a downer.  It's Russo's witticism that brings that special degree of levity, sensitivity and warmth to all those people, passages and conversations that makes the novel so alive and so great.     This is the one.  This is the book that once you've finished reading you will want to tell everyone else to read.  Don't miss \\"Empire Falls.\\"	2004-07-18

I bought it take on a short vacation and ended up reading the entire novel on the car ride en route.  Needless to say, I was thoroughly enthralled by this book.    Detective Harry Bosch's endeavor to solve a 20-year-old murder of a 12-year-old boy made for an interesting plot.  But it was Connelly's ability to seamlessly move his characters in and out of a shifting storyline that kept the pages turning at a brisk pace. I found his writing to be very fluid and very readable.  And I really didn't come across any dead spots in the book.  I suppose that at some point the final outcome became predictable but, for me, that didn't dampen one iota my enjoyment of \\"City of Bones.\\"  Other reviewers have stated that Connelly has done better in some of his other books in the Harry Bosch series.  That being the case, I certainly will be reading many more of Connelly's works.	2004-07-17

The fact that this has been a heretofore unrecounted event will capture the attention of most readers.  However, readers anticipating another \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" will be disappointed.  While being a fascinating read, \\"Flyboys\\" fails to take you to the emotional high that Flags does.  Also, Bradley replicated the structure of Flags by first attempting to chronicle what made these eight young men become pilots and the events that brought them to that fatal point in time. That part was interesting. But where Bradley overreached was in his attempt to put the entire Pacific war into a historical context by going way back and editorializing about American history.  That was too broad of a reach which diluted the storyline and, ultimately, Bradley's credibility.      If you take the events from the pilots' capture to conclusion, \\"Flyboys\\" is an interesting read.  That part of the story should be told.  All else is a little suspect.  \\"Flyboys\\" is probably not as bad as the one-star reviews but certainly not as good as Flags.	2004-06-27

And.....it really was.  I was most surprised that, for an accomplished writer, Patricia Cornwell wrote with such a lack of focus.  It was as if she took a shotgun approach - blasting out clusters of speculations in hopes that some might randomly find the mark and stick as facts.   The previous reviewers have all done a thorough job in delineating all of the non-facts and fallacies in her argument for fingering Walter Sickert as the infamous Jack the Ripper.  No need to be redundant here.    I did give \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" a generous two-star rating because a) I did finish the book, and b) it did contain a modicum of interest for me.  However, in the end it was a totally unconvincing and unsatisfying read.	2004-06-17

The basic concept of Calliope Stephanides' transformation from a female to a male might put off some readers and cause them to avoid this novel.  That would be ashamed because that is but the basic thread around which Eugenides tells a much more richly sweeping tale - a tale of depth and breadth spanning several generations.  His subtle humor and his uniquely complex characters (with such eclectic names as Chapter Eleven and The Obscure Object) added to his imaginative storyline results in one heck of an addictive read.     What differentiates \\"Middlesex\\" from other grand sagas that I've read is Eugenides' writing.  His command of words and phrases is remarkable.  And the manner in which he seamlessly switches from first-person to third-person, from past to present, from levity to somberness keeps the narrative alive and from falling into a linear monotony.  Brilliant.  And so is this novel.  Don't pass this one up.	2004-06-15

It's more of a character novel of Ruby Lee, a second-generation Chinese-American torn between her old-world family customs and her new Gen-X environment.   Author Mei Ng offers an acute insight into this Chinese-American culture as Ruby struggles through her dealings with her own family's dysfunction, with her relationships with American men and with her grappling with her own sexual identity.    Some have felt that Mei Ng's writing was a bit contrived and somewhat flat.  I can only state that I did not find that to be the case.  In fact, I thought that her writing was the book's redeeming attribute.  I liked her narrative prose and the way she poignantly described Ruby's relationship with her family and her friends.  I had a feeling that Mei Ng intertwined a lot of her own persona into Ruby's character. And that is what made the novel alive and believable.  Overall, I would have to give \\"Eating Chinese Food Naked\\" my thumbs up.	2004-06-07

Akitada Sugawara, a minor clerk from the Ministry of Justice, initially endeavors to solve a blackmail plot at the Imperial University. But shortly thereafter he becomes drawn into a series of seemingly unrelated multiple murders.  A nobleman of high integrity and with a penchant for solving crimes, Akitada finds himself entangled in a mysterious web of treachery and conspiracy.     Author IJ Parker does a fairly decent job keeping the storyline moving with very few dead spots.  The feudal Japanese setting is befittingly presented but the characters' behavior and dialogue seemed to be more contemporary Western than colloquial Eastern.  And, at times, the action and the dialogue got a bit corny.  However, this shouldn't overly dissuade readers from enjoying this engaging tale.	2004-05-28

American Alex Thorn travels to Japan searching for answers about the death of his son who was an exchange student there.  Along the way he elicits the help of Gaby Stanton, a female American expatriate and former teacher at Shizuyama University.  In order to navigate the somewhat mysterious and often quirky Japanese society Thorn must first learn about the intricacies of Japanese customs and the chasm that separates Eastern and Western ways of thinking.   A thoroughly enlightening journey it turns out to be.  Ultimately, the closure Thorn seeks ends up opening a new sense of self-awareness, a new sense of hope and new sense possibilities in moving his life forward.    Author Sara Backer is dead-on the mark as she so wonderfully and cleverly captures the subtle nuances of the Japanese.  Herself having spent three years teaching in Japan, Ms Backer is able to add a firsthand flavor to her writing - especially through her female character Gaby Stanton.

Indeed, Sensei turned out to be a very good read although it was somewhat action-lite. The basic plot revolves around a manhunt for a revenge-seeking Ronin killer who is capable of vanquishing martial arts experts in his attempt to find one particular victim. Through this manhunt, author John Donohue deftly exposes the reader to the arcane martial arts culture and takes them deep into the soul of the martial arts warrior. Sensei doesn't contain a lot of fight-action sequences (if that is what you are looking for) but is well written and entertaining.	2004-05-18

I surely wouldn't have found it otherwise.  And that would have been most unfortunate since this is one of the most enjoyable reads I've had.      \\"Bridge of Birds\\" is a fantasy tale of Li Kao's and Number Ten Ox's quest for the Great Root of Power to save the village's children who are dying from a mysterious illness.  Like Odysseus' journey home their trek traverses the breadth and depth of China's mythical landscape and folklore while engaging some of the most fascinating, humorous and irresistible characters along the way.  Throw in a wonderful ending and you have a complete novel that radiates charm, wit, humor and a range of human emotions. Kudos to author Barry Hughart whose marvelous penmanship kept the characters alive and the plot flowing in a seamless manner.       It is a real pity that this fantastic novel hasn't found a wider audience.  Perhaps with some luck \\"Bridge of Birds\\" will experience a much deserved revival that will keep it from vanishing off library and bookstore shelves.  Meanwhile, read it for yourself and you, too, will earnestly recommend it to all your friends as I have.	2004-05-15

Through this endeavor Poe unwittingly becomes a participant in a bizarre game in which in the players possess dual personalities - one real, one fantasy.

But author Marc Estrin's unique departure from Kafka is refreshing.  After flying away from a Viennese circus Gregor lands in America where he subsequently meets and interacts with some of the most notable figures of the early 20th century.  Gregor's unique bug-like perspective endears him to those that he becomes close to.  But it is also this unique bug-like perspective that focuses clarity into America's moral conscience during that turbulent period.    I wanted to give \\"Insect Dreams\\" 5-stars but I did find the book to be a little uneven in flow.  Certain parts were drawn out to the point where the book lost momentum that had to be recaptured in later sections.  Still, \\"Insect Dreams\\" is an imaginative endeavor that is well worth reading.	2004-05-06

If you enjoy those CSI-type television shows then you'll love this book because it details the processes that those actor-pathologists supposedly go through before proclaiming the cause of death.  Informative, yes, but it's author Mary Roach's light-hearted quips and sometimes sardonic wit that makes this book oh so entertaining.  I found it somewhat ironic to be laughing out loud while reading about such an off-beat, serious and sometimes morbid subject as human cadavers.      As interesting and important cadaver research is today it has an even more colorful and entertaining history.  As Ms Roach takes you through its evolution she introduces you to some of the strangest people performing some of the weirdest undertakings in their endeavors to understand and treat the human condition.  Definitely a uniquely fascinating and entertaining read.	2004-04-30

But it was author Will Christopher Baer's hypnotic narrative and the sense that something macabre was happening that had me hooked.  Overlay the fact that Phineas was drugged (thus making it difficult to delineate what, in his mind, was real, what was a hallucination and what was a flashback) then add a bunch of characters that were incredibly sexual, highly sinister and wholly without a moral compass and you have the formula for a very dark yet highly riveting novel.      As mentioned, I am not certain that I like this type of work but I do know that Baer wrote a second book to this one and I am going to have to read it as well.	2004-04-27

Christopher Boone is a 15 year-old autistic boy who, after finding his neighbor's poodle kill by a garden fork, sets out to discover the identity of the murderer.  Through his 'detecting' Christopher discovers the culprit but in doing so he also discovers so much more about himself.  But the true discovery is left for the readers of this wonderful novel who discover not only the uniquely different world as seen through Christopher's eyes but also his truly underlying genius.      I understand from previous reviewers that author Mark Haddon had actually worked with autistic children - and it is reflected in his brilliant first-person narrative, spoken through Christopher's authentic voice.   He shows how Christopher is neither capable of judging or ascribing any emotions to anything he experiences and thus is able to simplify his complex world.  Haddon doesn't coddle his character nor does he minimize or exaggerate the difficulties Christopher's parents have in dealing with a child with Christopher's condition.  And therein lies the true appreciation for this simply terrific novel.    \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time\\" is a 5-star read that should not be missed.	2004-04-27

I quickly devoured the book and, to my surprise, found that I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />To those criticisms that \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" is overly sentimental, that the characters are one-dimensional or that the race relations portrayed are skewed I can only state that I did not find that to be the case nor did I find that to be a problem.  I doubt that author Sue Monk Kidd intended to write novel about the civil rights movement in the 60's or about the complex nature of black/white relationships in the South.  She simply told a wonderful story within the context of those times.  Sometimes simple is better.  And \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" is simply one of those better novels.	2004-03-02
US	51868459	R1741KSZLAP90K	0871136791	11590154	Cold Mountain	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Brilliantly Written	I thought this book was terrific though it took several tries for me to really get into it.   Similar to watching a British-made film where it takes a bit for my ear to get acclimated to those accents, it took a bit for me to get with the cadence of author Charles Frazier's prose-like narrative style.  But once I hooked into it the results were stunning.  I also saw the movie version of \\"Cold Mountain\\" and thought it was also a visually stunning masterpiece.  What the movie director accomplished through visual cinematography, Frazier accomplished through his brilliantly crafted words.       The storyline is one in which a young Confederate soldier is so drawn by a love for a women he but briefly knew three years earlier that he walks out of an army hospital and walks back to Cold Mountain to be with her.  His 300 mile journey takes him not only through the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains but also through the tragedies and struggles of war.  The war that Frazier describes is not one that is fought on the grand battlefields but one that is fought by common people struggling to survive.      Apparently from all of the Amazon.com reviews, \\"Cold Mountain\\" is a love-it or hate-it type of novel.  Me, I loved it and would heartily recommend it to anyone who has an appreciation for brilliant writing.	2004-02-07

Author David Sedaris weaves a series of lighthearted anecdotal essays into an amusing and somewhat engaging book.  Well written, the book flows easily.  But I have to admit that unlike many of the previous Amazon.com reviewers I did not find \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" to be particularly laugh-out-loud funny.  Amusing and entertaining, yes.  A smirk and a smile every now and then.  But it's more like a good walk and a bright sunny day.  Very enjoyable but not tremendously memorable.  Good if you are looking for something easy to pass the time.	2004-01-24

Good plot, interesting characters, yes.  But it's author Craig Clevenger's razor-sharp, deftly crafted writing that keeps you hooked into the novel.

But it's the glimpse and the earthy feel of the Thai flesh trade sub-culture that will keep you intrigued and riveted to the book.      In his endeavors to solve a bizarre murder case Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep, a devout Buddhist and son of a prostitute, takes an all too familiar search through the bars and brothels of Bangkok and through the Asian underworld.  Author John Burdett gives the reader some fascinating insights into Thai culture and into the Buddhist soul.  Well written and well worth taking a shot to read.	2004-01-13

Pick a copy of it at your local library or bookstore and thumb through it.  Then you will understand.     It is likely that you have never read anything like the way this novel is constructed and that you likely have never 'experienced' a literary style like Mark Danielewski's.  Like it or hate it (there is no middle ground) you will find yourself drawn into discussions/debates with anyone you find who has also read and experienced this book.    The storyline unfolds when the protagonist Johnny Truant discovers notes to manuscript belonging to a deceased, blind tenant in an apartment.  As he begins to put the notes together the uncompleted manuscript begins to tell a seemingly surreal story of a photojournalist who moves into a house that slowly begins to manifest supernatural characteristics.  Then a second story develops within the book's footnotes (and there are many, many footnotes) which begins to describe the changes happening to Johnny Truant as he becomes obsessed with the manuscript.    \\"House of Leaves\\" is not a easy read but will highly reward those with the perseverance to stick it out.	2004-01-04
US	51868459	REBR98RN6XMDT	0399149104	87876541	Rain Fall	Books	5	6	7	N	Y	An Action-Packed Read	As a reader of Dennis Lehane, Stephen Hunter, etc. I am always looking for a new author with a page-turning writing style and a new intelligent action-character.  Author Barry Eisler is a new favorite now that I have finished his novel \\"Rain Fall.\\"    Eisler creates mercenary hitman John Rain as his not-so-prototypical central character.  Indeed, how John Rain deals with his friends and foes are very uncharacteristic of your everyday hero.  Being half Japanese and half American John Rain finds himself drifting between cultures and between his haunted past and his secretive present as he pursues a computer disk in competition with both government agencies and the Tokyo underworld.     Having lived in Japan Eisler deftly captures the incredible feel and subtle nuances of culture in modern Japan.  I enjoyed his crisp writing style, the absorbing storyline and all of the fast-paced action.  If you enjoy this genre take a shot at \\"Rain Fall\\" - you won't be disappointed.	2004-01-04

Its 900 pages and its less-than inspiring subject matter initially intimidated me.  But when the mood struck I started the first page.  Two days later I finished it and only felt bad that I waited so long to read it.  I suppose that's what a talented writer can do - make 900 pages evaporate in no time.    There are so many terrific things that I would like to say about this book that my words would become a mini-novel unto itself.  The one comment I would make is the thought that stays with me when I read the last full paragraph - how that paragraph so beautifully captured the essence of the entire novel.     Suffice to say that a book with a talented author, a great storyline, engrossing characters and a penetrating theme contains the right ingredients for a captivating read.	2004-01-03

While pondering what book I should read next I happened to pull this one out of my bookcase.  I remembered liking the book so I gave it another read.  And like a fine wine I found that it has much improved with age.      Author AJ Cronin tells a wonderfully moving and inspiring story of a young Scottish priest who sets out to China and spends the better part of his life overcoming many hardships to establish a Catholic mission there.  Father Chisholm is a protagonist to be admired by both secular and non-secular readers because he is a man who dedicates his life to a faith and to a cause and achieves not by doctrine but through personal example.  This culminates in a very moving passage which should be left to those who have not yet read book to enjoy.    \\"The Keys of the Kingdom\\" is still a 5-star read after all these years.	2004-01-03

Through their struggle these Las Mariposas (The Butterflies as they are respectfully referred) eventually become national symbols for freedom.  A story retold through the eyes and authentic voices of each of the four sisters, author Julia Alvarez does a wonderful and unique job in capturing not only their spirit but their sensitivities as well.  \\"In the Time of Butterflies\\" is an inspirational novel worth taking the time to read.	2003-07-25
US	51868459	RCNU8JW5FDZRY	0553111337	243328997	Flags of Our Fathers	Books	5	4	4	N	N	An Extraordinary Tribute	This is a book that you will read, reflect and then recommend to everyone you can.  Powerful and poignant - yes, but that doesn't truly capture the essence of this book.      The pretext of \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is interesting.  James Bradley is the son of Doc Bradley, a reserved individual who becomes a reluctant icon immortalized in 1/400th of a second when a photographer captures him and five other Marines raising the flag on Mount Suribachi.  Though a bona-fide war hero, Doc Bradley never speaks about his war experiences or that famous photo - not to his family, his friends or to the news services that continually call.  Upon Doc Bradley's death James Bradley discovers some war memorabilia that his father secretly kept.  This discovery peaks James Bradley's interests and he thus sets out to chronicle what brought Doc Bradley and the five other Marines to that famous moment in time.    That part of the book is fascinating.  But to understand why Doc Bradley never spoke about that experience one has to understand the battle on Iwo Jima itself.  And that is the part where the book really takes off.  James Bradley not only captures the truly horrific nature of that battle but also captures the incredible valor of the Marines who fought it.      If, like me, you never knew anything about that battle of Iwo Jima other than the flag raising then you need to read this book.  If you want to read a book that will truly inspire and emotionally move you then you must read this book.  And you will also recommend \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" to others because I can't recommend it highly enough to you.	2003-07-10

I found \\"Atonement\\" to be long on theme (excellent) but short on flow.   Ian McEwan is an accomplished writer but like so many others I found his book painfully slow.  In truth, it may not have been but very often I had to mentally fight to stay with it.  That may have been because I thought many sections were so uninteresting that I momentarily stopped caring about where the story was headed.  I also found the book's characters lacking any appeal.  Briony was an intriguing but very unsympathetic central character i.e. she just wasn't someone I could care about.       Intellectually I liked the book's powerful theme of an individual's guilt and struggle for redemption.  However, I had to work to get there.  If you don't mind expending a little effort \\"Atonement\\" may strike the right chord in you.  For me it was an interesting but not a very enjoyable read.	2003-07-06

In this fictional memoir, Ms. Stark recounts her life story from a rebellious Kentucky teenager through her various marriages and through her rise to superstardom under the big top.  A real gender-breaker Ms. Stark becomes the world's first and foremost tiger trainer during the era when the circus was the king of entertainment.  Through the colorful narrative of her tumultuous life we also get a glimpse into the universe of the circus and all the eclectic characters (human and otherwise) that dwell in it.    Author Robert Hough does a great job in keeping the action fresh and fast-paced in a writing style that is easy reading and highly entertaining.

This is the standard that I measure all other adventure books against.      Krakauer puts you right there on the mountain and gives you an incredible feel for the treacherous and hostile conditions awaiting those who attempt to summit Mt. Everest. Moreover, he gives you an acute insight into what drives these climbers to want to conquer the world's highest mountain.  The desire to achieve the summit becomes an almost overwhelming obsession to many.  And it is this obsession that causes critical errors in judgment and makes even the world's best climbers take chances that ultimately lead to disastrous consequences.  Incredible how overwhelming and unrelenting a mountain storm can be as it descends and unleashes itself on the climbers.  Equally incredible is how Krakauer takes you step-by-step up that mountain and through that ill-fated adventure.	2003-07-02

Written in typical Shaara fashion, the story is told from the multiple perspectives of the war's major figures.  If you enjoyed Jeff Shaara's previous novels on the Civil War and the Mexican War you will not be disappointed in either \\"The Glorious Cause\\" or \\"Rise to Rebellion,\\" the first book of the series.     I am a big fan of Jeff Shaara and have read all of his books to-date.  I think that all readers should understand that Shaara does not write history books per se.  Rather he writes wonderful fiction told in historical settings.  I am sure that he does his due diligence in researching the facts before undertaking his novels.  But if some of the facts don't jive with the true historians then so be it.  That should not diminish one iota the pure enjoyment of reading this novel.  High school history class should have been so enjoyable.	2003-07-01

But I can say with certainty that \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" is absolutely one of those books.  I was fortunate that I knew nothing about this book before I started reading so I had no preconceived notions about it.  What unfolded within those pages was a uniquely imaginative masterpiece that I never expected.     100 years of the Buendia family in the mythical South American town of Macando told in a magical realism tale doesn't begin to explain the essence of magnificent novel.  Magical realism is best not explained but experienced by reading \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\\"  I would implore everyone who hasn't done so already to add this masterpiece to their repertoire of greatest novels read.	2003-06-30

Then I read \\"White Oleander\\" and was immediately struck my author Janet Fitch's exquisite, poetic and, yes, lyrical writing style.  She masterfully matches her writing to the characters in the novel - especially Astrid's poet mother Ingrid.  I finished \\"White Oleander\\" in one sitting and immediately told my reading compadres that they had to read this book because the writing was absolutely stunning.    You will see from all the reviews that the subject matter maybe somewhat harsh.  Yet Astrid's survival of the foster care process is hauntingly beautiful and powerful.  From page one to page last \\"White Oleander\\" will keep you mesmerized.	2003-06-29

I would have to agree with many of the previous reviewers that \\"Shark Dialogues\\" does not always represent accurate historical fiction.  And I would also agree with those that said that the book sometimes loses its focus and occasionally delves into extreme political activism.      That said, \\"Shark Dialogues\\" is still a wonderful read.  You can feel author Kiana Davenport's passion for her Hawaiian heritage which is so strongly reflected in Pono, the powerfully haunting and mystical central character.   And you can sense the great beauty of ancient Hawaii through Ms. Davenport's wonderfully rich descriptions of the islands, its valleys and its people.    \\"Shark Dialogues\\" is a saga of a culturally changing Hawaii told through a daughter of a Tahitian chief in the late 1830's through Pono through her four granddaughters and through the pearls that connect them all.  Historically accurate? No.  A wonderful read? Yes.	2003-06-15

Rare is that person who will not be emotionally affected by this book.     \\"The Things They Carried\\" is not so much a book about the Vietnam War as it is about the people caught within the context of that war. The chapers entitled \\"On The Rainy River\\", \\"Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong\\" and \\"The Man I Killed\\" are standouts that stopped me cold and caused me to reflect and reread them before proceeding on. Those readers who have lived through the Vietnam War era will appreciate how well Tim O'Brien captures the multiple personal experiences/impacts of that time.    Pathos is a word best captured by this Tim O'Brien's brilliantly written novel. Read and experience it for yourself and you will understand why so many reviewers give it their highest recommendation.	2003-05-21

The guilty pleasure you have because it tasted so good and you enjoyed it so much?  That's the feeling I had after I finished reading this novel.  Perhaps I believe that I should be reading books more ethereal in nature.  But there was no denying that, after being riveted for 973 pages, I really, really enjoyed this novel.    The central thread of the book is the building of a magnificent cathedral in 12th century England.  Surrounding this thread are dozens of classic characters and at least a half dozen storylines.  What makes this novel so wonderful is that you never lose track of the characters or the complex plots and sub-plots.  Author Ken Follett does a masterful job in blending all of these storylines together in a manner that epitomizes storytelling at its best.    \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is unlike any other novel that Ken Follett has written.  I wish he would write more like this one.	2003-03-07

I like it better when a book turns out to be surprisingly good. \\"Audrey Hepburn's Neck\\" certainly accomplishes both.    Toshi is the main character who grows up in rural Japan then moves to Tokyo where he dates American women and thus learns about the big city and about American women - particularly the cultural differences between Japanese and Americans. At first, author Alan Brown illustrates this in an elegant, entertaining and almost whimsical manner. But what starts as something seemingly superficial turns much deeper as Toshi discovers much more about himself and what it means to be truly Japanese.    \\"Audrey Hepburn's Neck\\" is a quick, enjoyable read that will \\"surprise\\" you with its powerful and intelligent theme.	2003-03-02

Perhaps. But whether or not you agree with Gavin Menzies' conclusions you will most certianly be entertained by this fascinating and thought-provoking research.<br /><br />China, during the Ming Dynasty under reign of Zhu Di, was a nation foremost in wealth, power and technology. It was within this context that China launched the Treasure Fleet under Admiral Zheng He with the mandate \\"to proceed all the way to the end of the earth to collect tribute from the barbarians beyond the seas...to attract all under heaven to be civilised in Confucian harmony\\".<br /><br />Did Zheng He succeed? Menzies lays out a litany of evidence including maps predating European exploration; carbon dating sunken ships; stone monuments; DNA and linguistics; plant and animal migration; and the journals of explorers such as Columbus and Verrazzano to support his argument that he did indeed.<br /><br />While some of Menzies' arguments may require a little leap of faith and some of his conclusions may be the result of his exuberance of discovery his book is, nonetheless, arguably plausible and undeniably thought-provoking.	2003-03-01
