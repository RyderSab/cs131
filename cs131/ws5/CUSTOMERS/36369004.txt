This review is of the short story \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon \\"The Legend of Sleep Hollow\\" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend.	2005-10-10

If you're interested in immigration, Ireland, and how The Great Hunger affected all of this, then this book is a good introduction.  The writing is very simple, but rather than showing a lot of events, author Clara Pastore told it in description, and in reality, we don't say people's name when we talk to them, and Pastore wrote the dialogue as such.  While interesting, this story may be misleading for beginner learners of this subject, as not every family who came to America from Ireland were as luck as the McGilray's, and Pastore should have said that.  Lastly, the epilogue read more as a chapter, instead of summing up the character lives fully.  Nonetheless, I recommend.	2005-10-06

I began reading other books about journaling, and they were so factual with stringent journaling exercises that were geared for the artistically inclined - even experienced - journal keepers, and they were extremely intimidating.  If you're a beginner in the world of journals, this book is the best out there, as it's geared for the \\"every person,\\" giving realistic examples for real people to journal, and very creative exercises to jump start your journaling experience, which only require you to sit down and write.  If you're already a journal keeper, this book will renew that love you have for your journal and will re-open your eyes to the wonderful world of journaling, giving it new life.  I've been inspired by author Alexandra Johnson, and I cannot wait to explore my journal even further.  I recommend.	2005-10-04

I noticed that used \\"Johnny Depp: A Modern Rebel\\" by Brian J. Robb took some of what Esme Hawes wrote verbatim, but Robb's biography was more in detail, not leaving out many facts (or truths), and was up-to-date (Hawes book is from 1997, leaving out much of Depp's more recent films and his newly acquired blockbuster status).  The pictures are limited, but are in color, and the book is written straightforwardly making it easy read.  If you're looking for an introduction into the life of Johnny Depp, and you're a younger fan, than this will please you, if you don't mind it being out-of-date.  I \\"sorta\\" recommend.	2005-10-04

You feel a seamless time flow which is necessary when reading a series of books.  It's also helpful to read them after they've all been published, as I am doing.  The Amish way of life still intrigues me, and I think this book completely demonstrates the faults of the Plain way of life, while \\"The Convenient\\" demonstrates the good aspects of their lifestyle, so it's an interesting (and confusing) contrast between the two books.  I can get past the soap opera-type story because of the character development and relations, although I had hoped there would be more family interaction, but the self-discovery the characters experienced was interesting.  I look forward to the next book.  I recommend.	2005-09-28

While this is classified as an adult book, I found its writing style and book layout to resemble that of a juvenile book. But, because of this, it's not overwhelming in its approach.  Written in 1985, some Amish communities may have since changed their way of living, so if you're looking for up-to-date information, then look elsewhere.  I was hoping for more information on their lives, like courtships and traditions.  The pictures are far-away shorts, but in color.

I think this book shows the good and bad of the Amish people.  We read about close-knit communities and strong families. We also read about their aversion to higher education and turning a somewhat blind-eye to how young people spend their social time before they take their vow to the church and God.  It's a very easy book to read, and the dialogue is rather lyrical.  This book was an introduction to this family, so the ends are loose, but I look forward to reading the other books in this series.  I recommend.	2005-09-12

While some plays thrive on their simplicity, I felt it spoiled this play.  With no scenes or acts, this play relies on fade-outs and a heavy imagination.  We see a 20-year span involving homes, cars, and people aging all on one stage.  Because we only get a taste of the people through this 20-year span, I could not warm up to and get to know the three characters in this play.  By the end, I know that Miss Daisy and Hoke are close, but I only know this because they've known each other for 20-years; I did not see the closeness emerge for myself.  I had truly hoped for more concerning Miss Daisy teaching Hoke to read and write - this would have added great character interaction.  The screenwriter's had to work hard to make this 39-page play into a 99-minute movie involving scenes and actual time spans.  I hope the movie is better.  I do not recommend.	2005-09-06

I suppose you can't go wrong with a biography about Johnny Depp, but I'm no expert when it comes to biographies and how well they are written and researched.  I found the information to be accurate, although there is one movie plot error, the full title of the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" sequel has changed since the publishing of this book, and Depp did not star in the movie \\"Sin City.\\"  Most of the information in this book is widely known, even if you aren't a rabid Johnny Depp fan, but I did learn about the many movies he intended to make, but which never began filming or was cut short, due to financial problems.  The pictures are nice, and there is a section of color pictures, but mostly black and white photos dominate this biography.  The only major problem I encountered was the choppiness which surfaced in chapter eight \\"Thrill Ride.\\"  The jumping of time from \\"Once Upon a Time in Mexico,\\" \\"Finding Neverland,\\" and \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\\" was quite distracting.  Instead of writing in order of release, author Brian J. Robb chose to write about the three movies in order of filming, which could lead to confusion.  Furthermore, this chapter went back and forth between the movies, instead of focusing on one before moving on to the next movie.  If you're interested in Johnny Depp, then this is a good start - I recommend.	2005-08-31

Sounds like something we all had to deal with at some point in our lives, but I'd like to think our college professors didn't drag us to a foreign country to help in a plot to, essentially, take over the world.  The three Indiana Jones movies \\"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\\" and \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,\\" showed us Jones as the full fledged archeologist/adventurer, with a little taste of his teen hood in \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" (with River Phoenix as the young Indy).  Because of this teen hood movie showcase, this book seems out of place, since by the time Indiana Jones was in college, he would have already faced adventures.  Aside from this, I found the story to be weak - not an Indiana Jones story at all.  Of course, one could say it is because that Indiana Jones was not yet \\"Indiana Jones,\\" but I felt author Rob MacGregor didn't tap into the essence of the character (but maybe it's Harrison Ford who is overshadowing it all).  The writing is a bit bland and confusing, and I felt the story to be exaggerated at the wrong times.  If you're looking for a summer read in-between some more profound books, then this may be your book.  Otherwise, no.  I \\"sorta\\" recommend.	2005-08-31

This last fact made it harder for me to let myself into her world, knowing that the things in her diary may not have happened that way, much less at all.  If you set this historical bungle aside, then the story is quite interesting, but slow-going.  I really wanted to know more about the \\"Coat-men\\" (the English settlers) according to Weetamoo, and I felt the ending was very hasty.  Much research and time went into this book, and I give credit to author Patricia Clark Smith for undertaking such a task, and I blame myself for not truly appreciating it, since I was caught up in the accuracy or their lack of it.  Since not much is known about Weetamoo, I had trouble seeing her through this diary, and after a while, I had to resign myself to thinking that this diary belonged to an ordinary Native American girl.  If you can look past the lack of information about Weetamoo, then this could be an enjoyable book.  I \\"sorta\\" recommend.	2005-08-14

At first, I felt like I was reading any other wilderness, prairie family book, and at times, it felt it redundant in its chapters.  I had not read a book about a family raising cattle and starting orange groves, so this was all new to me, but it quickly became old during the course of this book.  The constant span of years confused me, as I didn't see character development at all.  I found the flurry of characters to be overwhelming, and each character not to be admiral (more so in the second and third generation of MacIvey's).  After chapter 32, I lost all respect for the story, as it all seem fantastical and unrealistic to me.  Finally, I could not see the point author Patrick D. Smith was making, and I think it was washed out due to the vastness of this book.  I really wanted to like this book, and I enjoyed it for a while when the freshness of wild Florida was being revealed, but after that, the interest wore thin for me.

I've read a few Ellis Island immigration related stories before (not too many), but never have I read one about the bribery incidences and detained immigrants on Ellis Island.  It's so sad to think that foreigners who were coming to America for a better life were only to be greeted by evil, conniving, and thief-like people disguised as doctors, nurses, and other authoritative individuals.  This book shows the frustration non-English speaking people experienced, and how they were treated as infants and senile people, in hopes of taking their belongs and sending them back to their homeland over supposed medical diseases.  Kathryn Lasky wrote this wisely, leaving much to be desired about Sofia and her family, and I look forward to the sequel books.  I recommend.	2005-08-07

When reading, I felt that the two playwrights, Florence Ryerson and Colin Clements, expected the reader to be fully familiar with the history of the Women's Suffrage (do brush up on your history if you plan on reading/seeing this play).  And, I felt the \\"inside knowledge\\" everyone had about the \\"certain women\\" was barely shared, and I felt left out of the action.  To perform if, a lot of stamina would be needed for the actors and actresses, as this is a lengthy play with full costumes and quick dialogue.  For audience members, I'd say you need the Cliffs Notes for this time in history, and a great attention span.  I so very much wanted to enjoy reading this play dealing with an important time in our history, and I was looking forward to the humor, but I couldn't wait until it was over.

I do understand this is book one in a series (which seems to have trivial gem theme name protagonists), but relationships were formed and we didn't see them mature.  Since the rest of the series picks up with a different character, we lose the relationship we had with Ruby, therefore abandoning the little information and emotions we felt.  The religious aspect of the story was overflowing, smothering, and uncalled for, since no reason was touched upon to have it.  This book is labeled as a historical fiction, when a religious historical fiction label would have been apt, so it was poor marketing.  Because I know so little about the characters, I have no desire to move on in the series.  I do not feel that there was a big enough cliffhanger to pull me in.  I do not recommend. <br />	2005-07-23

Greetings! began as a very captivating play, dealing with the clashing of faiths (and lack thereof) and bringing in a new family member whose non-beliefs cause a disturbance. Then, it became silly.  Mickey, the mentally challenged brother, is overtaken by a \\"divine guidance,\\" showing the family that although differences can drive a family apart, it can bring them to together and help them accept one another.  If only the brother was not taken over like an Ouija board, maybe then I can handle it.  Perhaps if a stranger came to the house look for holiday pity, like a homeless person, as an example, and showed the family their faults and how to be a happy, accepting family, them maybe I can stomach it, but having the mentally challenged brother be a host for \\"someone\\" is absurd, and while theatre is not all about realism, with the fourth wall, there needs to be something the reader/views can grab hold of and believe.  I did like the ending - how the family came together and just let their differences be.  I \\"sorta\\" recommend.	2005-07-16

Civil war, romance, historicalness, you name it. Then the story began. I was interested in where it was going, with it starting with the relationships of Bel and Laurence's parents, then to the cousins Bel and Laurence, and then to their separate lives in the war and at home, and then onto Bel and her tutor Louis. There were so many relationships intertwined with each other, but development was scarce and then just abandoned. I wanted more relationship growth between Laurence and Bel and Bel and Louis, but I was left disappointed. Then author Maria Hummel threw in the past triangle between Bel's mother, Faustina, and Laurence's father, George. Hummel was trying for a very rich symbolic way of writing, but she came off as artsy, and she expected her readers to grasp her method. I also sensed that she did not know which plot to expound upon.  I do admit that I was at times disturbed by the war descriptions. The ending left me very disappointed, and made me ponder the entire point of the story. I was sorely disappointed. I do not recommend.	2005-07-15

It was smoothly written, not overbearing with \\"law\\" talk, and kept my attention completely.  Only a lawyer can write a book like this, and Barry Reed proves that.  The characters' personal life do not overpower the story, so as not to take away from the law case, but just enough information is given about them to understand their law abiding/not law abiding ways, and the transformation of Galvin just makes you cheer for the underdog.  I was apprehensive about reading a novel about law, but the courtroom chapters were absolutely invigorating, and the dialogue was natural and unpretentious.  I thoroughly recommend.	2005-07-08

He includes much action and physical stage direction that cannot be fully appreciated when being read in bed or while sitting on the sofa.  A lot of it is silent acting, with movement and facial expressions.  The beginning was very witty and funny (reminding me of Neil Simon), but as the play read on, it became drawn out and overdone.  After the mistaken identities and confusion, I expected the ending to be a \\"big bang,\\" but after the climax, it lost steam.  But, maybe when seen on the stage, it is fine.

I've never read a book dealing with the viewpoint of a condemned witch or anything dealing with the witch's point of view (the jailing to be exact).  There were three main characters narrating, Charity, Lucas, and Susannah, although Charity was only showcased once, and I would have liked an additional chapter of her point of view when she became \\"possessed.\\"  While I enjoyed the book for its historical merits, I felt the character development was lacking.  I wanted to know more about Charity and her relationship with the girls who cried out against the witches.  I wanted to know more about Lucas and why he was so devout to his religion, the family he left behind, his feelings concerning the many children he lost after his wife gave birth, why he felt more passion for Susannah than his wife, and a better transition in his personality concerning his children.  Susannah was a wishy-washy character; she was sinful because she lived and slept with men she was not married to, but why did she see this as the only way to escape her life with her father, why did she feel something other than physical attraction for Lucas, and why did she have such a strong maternal instinct?  I was left with many questions about the characters.  Finally, I would have liked there to be an Epilogue in addition to the Author's Note.  The book did have a large amount dialogue, but I felt that it brought to life the story much better than just plain descriptions.  And I was interested in how author Megan Chance brought out sexuality during the Salem Witch trials and Puritan time, as that is hardy ever a focal point in books related to this time period.  For the historical fiction aspect, I recommend.	2005-07-03

Elements from the chapters in this book made it into the movie, but if you're looking for Will Smith's character and Sonny the robot, then try for a novelization of the movie.  Each chapter was basically a short story, and each story was development fully.  I didn't see the point in have a journalist ask questions to Dr. Susan Calvin, as I think it jumbled the story up more, and it's evident that this story was written in the late '40s/early '50s based upon such phrases as \\"Jumping Jupiter\\" and \\"Swell.\\"  The chapter that least interested me was the last chapter, \\"The Evitable Conflict.\\"  It was full of useless jabber and was prolonged much too much.  Sometimes, Asimov wrote as if the reader knew what he meant, as sometimes he didn't explain his terminology, since even in today's time, the terms aren't used (a glossary would have been helpful).  It is fun to see how the authors' imagined the future to be.  I \\"sorta\\" recommend.	2005-06-19

I could not find a point in any of the five stories, and they all left me feeling empty.  \\"Don't Look Now\\" was completely dim-witted and anti-climatic (as were all the stories).  \\"The Breakthrough\\" did make me question science and at how much we want to live, but the characters were flat and lifeless.  \\"Not After Midnight\\" felt like it was going on a downward spiral to nowhere land, without a point to be found.  \\"A Border-Line Case\\" left me feeling repulsed and wondering what du Maurier was trying to say.  \\"The Way of the Cross\\" made me wonder if du Maurier's way of thinking is that God gives people their comeuppance; I found the shifting narrator to be irksome and it showed how little the author gave her characters varying personalities.  I closed this book realizing, that after these stories, along with \\"Rebecca,\\" that du Maurier has a very monotone and bland style of writing; she often goes of on pointless tangents.  \\"Pointless\\" is the ever returning word when speaking of du Maurier's writing.

The plot is one dimensional and not completely developed.  Gustav Flaubert could not decide where he wanted to go with his plot - a risqu&eacute; affair or how debt destroyed a family.  With the shifting of the plots, I lost interest in the story, as I thought only the affair was the principal plot.  The debt storyline felt like it was just thrown in, without a thought; I found it confusing and tedious.  The writing was appalling, and I lost respect for Flaubert as a writer because of it.  Such poor grammar and sentence structure!  The characters were underdeveloped and lacked motivation.  I had no idea why the characters were the way they were, and because of it, I didn't care about them.  Chapters were devoted to irrelevant narratives that did not further develop or advance any storyline or character.  The entire story was much too long, and I could not see where it was going (even if I did predict the ending).  Overall, this so-called \\"classic\\" needs to be retired, as it does not stand the test of time, and its author was horrible in his thought process.  I do not recommend.	2005-05-28

I love the theatre, so I was drawn to the plot immediately, since it is set around the London theatre, just near the turn of the century.  The characters are warm and inviting, taking you into their webs of love, deception, happiness, and anguish.  Though predicable and stereotypical, the characters were very alive, and will make you forget that you probably already know how everything will end.  The antagonist gets their comeuppance, and the protagonist lives happily ever after.  My complaint is that the main characters kept shifting, and I couldn't keep track of how people were related to one another.  It didn't hinder me from understanding situations eventually, but it was perplexing.  I immensely enjoyed reading about classic London theatre and the gossip that revolved around it.  If you love reading about life in the late 1800s, and enjoy the theatre, then this book is a must.  I recommend.	2005-04-28

Alexandra Bergson is a somewhat stereotypical character, when speaking in terms of feminine headstrong roles, and her brothers are the stereotypical side characters who do not agree with their older sister and her role in making \\"manly\\" decisions.  I admired Alexandra for her capabilities and proficiency, but after the climax, I lost respect for her as a female protagonist.  Her complete forgiveness of Frank Shabata, and her blaming of Marie and Emil were irrational, atypical, and inconceivable.  Her friendly relationship with Carl was underdeveloped and undistinguished.  My last complaint concerning Cather's writing style is her disorganization of chapters and time frames.  I had no idea what time and place the next chapter would bring, and I felt very disoriented because of it.  Cather wrote the era wonderfully, and the splendor of the land came through well enough.  The era is what kept my attention, after my disgust with Alexandra.  I \\"sorta\\" recommend.	2005-04-14

The nine short stories author Alison Lurie wrote are equivalent to an amateur writer, who did not have his/her story edited.  At times, they are insulting (\\"Fat People,\\" is an excellent example), the female characters all have the same manner of speaking and coping with their problems (and the men think they are \\"being ridiculous\\"), and the ghosts come across as hallucinations of the female characters.  Lurie's writing is so bad, that I feel embarrassed for her.  The grammar is horrible, and while she attempted to write in a conversational style, it came across as if she did not know how to form a readable sentence. The stories are so asinine, that I could not help but roll my eyes and loathe Lurie for portraying women as \\"weak creatures\\" who see apparitions when under stress (I say \\"apparitions,\\" as the ghosts did not haunt, but just \\"appear\\").  I was hoping for a super natural ghost thriller, but instead, I got an amateur writer who wrote nine short stories about folly.  I do not recommend.	2005-04-04

I first read this book at the age of ten, again at thirteen, and I've just read it again. My first review, written nearly three-years-ago, was written in haste, as I just wanted to add reviews to my About You Area. I first read it at the age of ten for school, after a teacher noticed my immense interest in the Holocaust (which lasted for nearly six-years straight). When I read it, I was amazed by this girl who seemed so much older than myself (at the time, a thirteen/fourteen/fifteen-year-old seemed greatly older) - a girl who lived the most effervescent years of her life in near solitary, only to be killed after yearning so much from herself and life. I read it again three years later, at the age of thirteen - the age Anne Frank started her diary. It was then that I felt a true connection with her, as we shared the same views about our parents, school, writing, and life. I felt one with her, and my fascination with the Holocaust deepened, sending me on a whirlwind of research and learning more about the Jewish religion. I kept this book on my bookshelf for years, and when it was chosen as a selection in the book club I am apart of, I was overwhelmed with excitement, wondering what I would take away with it, years after my last two readings. I was able to see the girlish immaturity of Anne Frank, which had seemed so mature when I had last read it, and I saw the immense emotional distraught she was experiencing, and how adults say everything is a \\"phase\\"; whether an outburst is or not, they should be dealt with seriously. I was also able to appreciate her fantastic writing skills and thought provoking deliberations. People say that this book does not portray the horrors of the Holocaust. This diary does, in the most haunting way. We can read inside the emotional thoughts of a young girl, when she herself was hidden away from the world - a girl who did not truly understand what the world was like for Jews, and what her fate would turn out to be, as she was hidden away in what was thought of as a safe refuge. People think that if a book does not deal directly with a gas chamber or a concentration camp, then it is not about the Holocaust. How wrong they are! This is not a book, but a girl's life written down in ink on pages, and it boggles my mind how people can be utterly disrespectable and say it's \\"boring\\" and \\"just a teen girl's musings.\\" I implore you to take a closer look, and see if you could so eloquently put your thoughts and fears about things we do in our lives everyday (learn, use the lavatory, cook and eat), only minus the enormous, impending fear that life could end with one knock on your door (a fear I hope we never have to experience).

Books deemed as a \\"classic\\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message.  This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect.  The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions.  Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome.  Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality.  \\"Blas&eacute;\\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane.  After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy.  Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth.  He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth.  I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable.  I do no recommend.	2005-03-12

This is my first Mark Twain book, and it's surely to be my last, as I was sorely disappointed.  While the grammar and dialect are supposed to be written realistically, I found it cumbersome.  The adventures changed constantly, and if Twain had written with one adventure in mind, then my attention span would not have diminished.  When Tom Sawyer entered the book permanently, I became irritated, because when he arrived, the story became prolonged and trivial.  I feel I wasted my time reading this book.

From the synopsis of the book, I thought it would have been more of a historical fiction (which it is classified as, but it should be classified into the religious genre), as I had not read a book about anyone who delivered the dreaded messages telling families that their sons, fathers, and husbands had died in battles during World War II.  This topic was barely used, and it was only to bring in the religious aspects, which disappointed me.  Also, the protagonist kept changing from Andy to Estella, and it seemed that the antagonist wasn't very clear, either.  There was absolutely no character development, and I wish more time was spent on the people, rather then their religion.  My final complaint is that author Tracie Peterson was practically saying Andy was Jesus Christ, which I found erroneous.  The similarities she presented to the reader were too similar, and I found that disturbing.  However, this story does show the closeness of neighbors during this troublesome time in history, which we rarely experience in this day and age.  I \\"sorta\\" recommend.	2005-01-22

Detailing the children of Mary and Anne, we find ourselves learning about the tragic and risqu&eacute; lives of Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth, through the eyes of Hannah, a Jewish girl who must put aside her faith on the outside, to live, and becomes the Fool of Queen Mary.  I thought that Hannah's own life and tribulations took away from the story, and would better suit her own story, without the politics of the court.  In \\"The Other Boleyn Girl: A Novel,\\" there was passion, sensuality, risqu&eacute; themes, and true torment, and even more defamation of characters. I felt this book lacked all of that.  The 500 pages were drawn out, and could have been significantly reduced, if Gregory removed Hannah and her husband, Daniel's, quandaries.  Nonetheless, this story was very interesting to read when it came to the matters of women in a marriage, etc.  If you like this time in history, then this is good novel to read.  I recommend.	2005-01-21

I am one of those readers, and I was very excited about this book.  The Trials are such an interesting time in our early American history, mainly because of its mysteries.  This book does not solve any mysteries, but helps us understand what a bystander felt like - a bystander who did not believe the outcries of witches.  Included in this story are sibling love (and hatred, at times), money worries, friendships, courtships, and farm life.  You'll never want to put the book down, and it's a very satisfying read.

I loved Simon's \\"Brighton Beach Memoirs\\" (his two sequels weren't as good), so I have very high expectations for his plays.  Here's a brief review for each play:    \\"The Odd Couple\\" - I went into this play knowing I wouldn't really like it, since I didn't care for the movie or television show.  I found it too neurotic.    \\"Plaza Suite\\" - This was a very depressing play.  Affairs outside the marriage is such a common theme in Simon's plays, and it's becoming sickening.    \\"Barefoot in the Park\\" - The best play in this whole volume.  Witty and sensual.  The movie is just as superb.    \\"Come Blow Your Horn\\" - The mother in this play is hysterical, and she's what saves the play from boredom.    \\"The Star-Spangled Girl\\" - By far the stupidest play I've ever read.    \\"Last of the Red Hot Lovers\\" - Simon tried too hard to be funny. You can tell when he wants you to laugh, and I don't like that.    \\"Promises, Promises\\" - He should stay away from musicals!  Boring and petty.    Overall, this volume was a letdown, but one to have - nonetheless - if you're a Neil Simon fan.  I \\"sorta\\" recommend.	2004-12-27

One could say Luther Krank is an updated Ebenezer Scrooge, but of whom come around in their feelings for Christmas just at the peak of the celebrated holiday.  I could relate to the nosey neighbor troubles, since I have a few nosey neighbors around myself (although they probably would not band together like the neighbors did in the book), and although the ending is predictable, it's still moving and comforting.  I did find some of the chapters about people gossiping in the town about the Kranks, along with the Kranks dealing the pesky carolers to be drawn out; furthermore, compared to the rest of the story, the ending was very abrupt.  I haven't seen the movie version, \\"Christmas with the Kranks,\\" so I cannot comment on whether the movie is faithful to the book or not.  If you're looking for something a little different to read this holiday season, then I recommend this book.	2004-12-17

It is a complete bore.  I could not understand Eleanor at all.  One minute she was confident about herself, the next minute self-conscious.  She liked Theo and Luke, and then despised them; I don't understand why she felt so close to the house.  There were no super natural experiences, aside from thumping on the door.  I felt this story was a total waste of time, and petty.  The movie \\"The Haunted\\" is very loosely based on this book (same character names, different circumstances, but much more interesting), and I suggest you see it instead.  This book is nowhere near a classic.  I do not recommend.	2004-11-11

Having a rebellious 14-year-old boy as the narrator was a wise choice, especially because of the time period, which is 1972.  This story involves a platonic love between a disfigured man and an emotionally distraught boy.  The trials and tribulations they both go through with one another is bumpy, but worth it.  The era seems too far-fetched, but probably likely.  The boy's family life is shameful and problematic (although it is not entirely his fault).

In the early 20th century, you relied on tween and teen boys to get your daily dose of news, and this \\"My America\\" book explains the daily lives of these boys.  Times were most certainly different, since you could let a 12-year-old work a street corner until dark, without any immediate worries.

The two main characters are clearly fashioned like Sherlock Holmes and his deductive investigating methods (Dupin) and his at times duped companion Watson (the unnamed narrator at times).  While I found the first 6 pages humdrum, since it only explained the analytical method of thinking (Dupin's way of thinking), and then Dupin's tedious soliloquies about how the murder may have been committed rather drably, the actual explanation of the crime is what caught my attention.

At times, I did find her snobby, and very much into herself and her books (she *is* married with a son, so there are higher priorities than reading).

If you're looking for supernatural frights, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a historical-adventure told with an interesting storytelling method, then you've come to the right book.  The reader will be so caught up in the time-traveling ghost story, that they won't realize they've just read a historical fiction - the premise is slavery.  This book redeemed my faith in author Avi, solely by the way he chose to begin the book.  Although the ending is abrupt and opened-ended, it's a good book for young readers to read over the summer.  A sequel would have been most appropriate.  I recommend.	2004-07-17
US	36369004	R15MDLX0VXPD4O	0140432264	82761703	Washington Square (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Compelling and depressing.	&quot;Washington Square&quot; is a story bursting with pain, sorrow, egotism, and shattered dreams.  Having seen the movies &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949) and &quot;Washington Square&quot; (1997), I possessed emotions and images going into the book, that others may not feel.  Nonetheless, I came to many conclusions.  Dr. Sloper, the father who emotionally-starved his only daughter, Catherine, used his money to pit his daughter into her own private Hell.  The same money Dr. Sloper thought Morris, Catherine's beau, would use frivolously.  He had no qualms about hurting his daughter in any form, and viewed Catherine as the object that took away all of his happiness.  Catherine, the plain heiress who was said to lack beauty, intelligence, wit, and anything worthwhile, fears, but loves her father.  She thinks he is magnificent, even when he spurts hatred towards her.  She falls in love with Morris Townsend, who is said to only want her for her money, and this is when the trials and tribulations begin.  Aunt Lavinia, Dr. Sloper's sister and Catherine's Aunt, is a young girl at heart, and only worsens things by her imaginative involvement.  Although it must be so, I did not get a full impression that Morris was only after Catherine's money.  The story is heart wrenching and you'll feel disgust for the characters, but will also feel shame for them.  As a side note, the 1997 movie &quot;Washington Square&quot; is the most faithful of the two movies, excluding the ending, and in my opinion, much more fulfilling than &quot;The Heiress.&quot;  The latter is dramatic, but does not delve into the main parts of the story.  I recommend.	2004-07-16

In fact, I think a subtle point was that a person may attend church, but that doesn't mean they are a good person, and that people who do not attend church, may in fact be good people (although I doubt these are the points author Oke was intending to make).  I enjoyed the character of Auntie Lou and her valor towards her feelings.  I found Grandpa and Uncle Charlie's actions to be awful (concerning finding Lou a suitable husband, and not leaving the choice up to her), and Josh and Gramps' relationship heartwarming.  If you're looking for a book to sit back and relax with, then this is the book for you.  I recommend.	2004-07-03

It's different.  With added and altered scenes, you may become a little perturbed, like myself.  Of course, background information was given for each character, which didn't really happen in depth within the movie, but the information seemed too far-fetched.  The character of Carl had the biggest change, and I don't think it was for the best.  Nonetheless, if you're reading this without seeing the movie first, then it is an interesting story about technology, and how it can be used for the worst.  I &quot;sorta&quot; recommend.	2004-06-27

Translator Matthew Ward has helped give us a powerful piece of literature. Author Albert Camus wrote a sensitive story about the purpose of life, and why we bother trying to live.  In the end, our fates are all the same, whether we succeeded in life or not.  The sentences are simple, but the meanings behind them are passionate.  Whether you've thought about your objective on this planet or not - this story will provoke questions within your brain.  I recommend.	2004-06-27

The dust jacket describes the book to be full of mystery and endeavors.  Rather, it was a retelling of events.  I finished the book unsatisfied.  It's about a fourteen-year-old boy who recounts the story of the most adventurous summer of his life.  It may be a good book for a young male reader, but if you're looking for a thrilling escapade, look elsewhere.  For male readers under the age of 13 - I recommend; all other readers - I do not recommend.	2004-06-18

Although I am not within the targeted age bracket, I still can imagine how I would have reacted after reading this book: disappointed.  Disney turned their famous ride into a fun movie, so one would think the junior novelization would have the same magic and humor.  Wrong.  Even though there was hardly anything offensive within the movie, the author cut scenes out.  While one may think scenes were added, take a look at the \\"special features\\" on the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" DVD, and you'll see where the extra dialogue and scenes came from.  All of the memorable lines were deleted and substituted for others, which is disappointing.  Nonetheless, you'll have pictures to look at while reading, so you can be reminded of the comical movie you've come to love.  I do not recommend.	2004-06-18

I saw this book on the discount shelves at the nearby conglomerate bookstore, and with its warm cover, I bought it.  I was worried that the plot would revolve around baseball, but it only ties the characters together.  It revolved back to teamwork and comradeship.  The chapters will fly by, and before you know it, you're at the epilogue.  That's where the story lost me, and I became confused.  The references to grandma, Gra-Ma, mother, father, etc., made me confused about who was who.  It's best to just leave off after the final chapter is finished.  An enjoyable read.

Though it is not as tense as &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; it is still full of anticipation.  I did find it gratuitously wordy.  If you do not read too much into the story, then you'll solve the crime in no time.  The ending will make you wonder if it is justifiable (and then you'll remember this is a work of fiction).  A good read for a vacation - I recommend.	2004-05-21

It could have easily been another war.  The story itself - three children struggle to live their lives while their father is off fighting for the American cause - is a stable one, though deficient.  This could be because the events flowed nicely, without much difficulty, or maybe it was because there was a lack of illnesses and death; realism wasn't truly there.  I was hoping for a historical note, but Whelan failed to include one.  I'll still read the other two books in the trilogy, but I will not put high expectations on them.

If you're looking for a sugarcoated tale of a woman's life in the West, then look for another book.  Dallas' book illustrates the nitty-gritty things women endured while traveling west and once settling.  The standards women needed to abide by were treacherous and merciless.  I felt an array of emotions while reading this: pity and strength for Mattie, repugnance and detestation towards Luke, ardor and fondness for Tom, etc.  Women may have been the \\"lesser\\" sex, but men could not endure what the women had.

I knew nothing about his marriage to his wife Martha (who would rather to be called Patsy), or about his home, Mount Vernon.

The sister with sight incorporates her emotions at the end of some of the entries as well; it's a two for one diary.

The plot isn't as strong as I had hoped for, and the hurricane isn't much of a focal point; I did not get a rich sense of history.  At times, I struggled through reading the African-American vernacular, and I didn't get the hang of it until more than halfway.

Pearl S. Buck wrote Wang Lung, in opinion, as a man who started out as a simple man, but became a selfish man who didn't want to worry himself over anything.  In doing so, it severed his family.  I became disgusted with him when he took in Lotus, and was tempted to stop reading the book. But, I had gone that far, so I went further.  His sleeping with Pear Blossom made me nauseous.

I did not find this play at all a farce and found the rhyming childish and annoying.  The play ends without a true ending and will leave you wanting the time you spent reading it back.  I do not recommend.	2004-01-30

It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend.	2004-01-24

They say Aristophanes thought women to be more than toys for their men, but I see the opposite.  I think Aristophanes made a satire out of women and the only thing they are good at: sex and reproducing male babies.  This is no compliment. To think that the only way women can change their husband's minds would be by withholding intercourse.  This is preposterous! I found this play derogatory with ill humor.

I dislike myths of all sorts, so I knew going into this play that I would find it discouraging to read.

I surely didn't, and I learned a great deal while reading this. I would have never thought that American's would discriminate American's, by calling Oklahoma residents \\"Okies.\\"  But, it's not much different today, if you stop and think about it.  That just stuck out in my mind while reading it.  The entrees were realistic (although it made me wonder, with C.J. being only 13-years-old, and with minimal schooling, how he could have written so well), and easy to read.

I found the characters different, but of course, you can say they matured, but Stanley was much more frantic than I remembered him to be.  Eugene was much more level headed - not the sex-crazed teenage boy we knew and loved.  Blanche lost her quirkiness, and the outcome of Jack and Kate disappointed me. The addition of Ben was what saved the play; the way Eugene played off of him was like \\"old times.\\"  I didn't feel the Jerome's were the Jerome's anymore.  I do not recommend.	2003-09-14

I think it's an interesting perspective: one of the books is from the soldiers point of view, while the other one is from the sister and family's point of view.  White made Molly the every modern girl, and all female readers will be able to relate to her (I even saw a little of myself in Molly).  I like how Ellen Emerson White made Molly the opposite of a hippy - very levelheaded and mature - during such a confusing time in history.  The TV show name-dropping did get a little tiresome, and I wished the epilogue included what came of the wounded soldiers at the VA hospital, but the story is excellent.  I recommend.	2003-09-13

I began thinking if I liked the play itself, or because it was written by Shakespeare.  Which then led to my thinking of whether it would be deemed such praise, if it hadn't been written by him, and I leans towards &quot;no.&quot;  The wit is somewhat dry, but the plot around Hero and Claudio caught my attention.  It showed me how women were regarded as objects and how easily they can be discarded.  And, how quickly men would believe any fault about a woman, without hearing her side of the story.  Scary, in my opinion.  Otherwise, it was interesting, but I don't know if I'd recommend it.	2003-09-08

Abbie worked so hard as a mother and a wife, and sacrificed her dreams and wantings, that it made me think of what my parents might have set aside for me.

I will never-ever read a collaboration novel that involves Oke and another author again.  Both of their writings were too jumbled and did not flow well.  I was able to figure out who wrote what, and you shouldn't be able to do that - both of the authors writings should mesh together in unison.  I thought Bunn's writing overpowered Oke's.  Since I focused so much on the techniques, I did not enjoy the plot one bit.  I finished this book feeling unfulfilled.  A huge disappointment - I do not recommend.	2003-06-24

If you're expecting a novel filled with accounts of the Salem Witch Trials, like I thought, you're wrong. It is not until almost 200 pages into the book will the subject be touched upon, and then gingerly dropped. Much of the writing is fillers and dribble; this book could have been 100 pages shorter. I didn't care for any of the characters, and all of them were typecast. The angry, strict Uncle, the caring, soft-spoken Aunt, two cousins - one being the flirt and one being sweet. And, of course, the outcast niece. I was very disappointed, as I had my sights set on a captivating Salem Witch Trial book. The title is very misleading. I do not recommend.	2003-06-22

I was expecting much more drama and I found her writing style very wishy-washy.  Also, it was extremely short.  It's not one of her better books; if this was your first Rinaldi read, try another book, before you form an opinion of her as an author.  She always includes an epilogue, which she didn't this time - another disappointment, and her \\"who is real, who isn't real\\" explanation was also not very clear.  I do not recommend this book full heartily, but because I love Rinaldi's books, I'm still giving it 3 stars.	2003-06-20

I felt Virginia A. McConnell did a wonderful job presenting the known facts, as well as including her speculations, but leaving the final verdict up to the reader.  The explanations of the era and how they dealt with these sorts of crimes, as well as how they dealt with it legally and medically were very educational and thought provoking.  I'm sure many criminalists, physiologists, lawyers, judges, and crime scene analysts, would have a field day solving these crimes.  If only they had the technology of today, back then.  Even if your genre is not &quot;true crime,&quot; this book is a great read.  I recommend.	2003-06-20

It's a decent read, but most of the pages were full of fluff and fillers.  I have no idea what it's like, but Damaris' constant thinking that men are drunks started to get to me and at times made me angry.  Predictable, as all of Oke's books are, and her endings come so quickly and without elaboration.  I &quot;sorta&quot; recommend.	2003-06-16

You must give it five stars alone knowing that this is a true story and someone actually lived this life.  At first, I found the writing style chopping, but before I knew it, I was flying through the pages like it was nothing!  It's an incredibly fast read, but it will leave an impression deep within you.  If you're learning about the Holocaust, or are interested in this time in history, then read this book!  I recommend.	2003-06-14

I took this out from my library not knowing how deeply religious it was, but with all of it's biblical and religious means, I still enjoyed the plot.  It shows, that with, or without faith in anything, you can still be strong.  But, what I dislike about Oke's books is the lack of an epilogue.  All of her books end suddenly, without any closure.  Very disappointing.  Nonetheless, I recommend.	2003-06-13

But, there are some hills of good and bad.  First off, I found everything too perfect and sugar coated.  What are the odds of Donnigan and Kathleen getting along?  Much less, falling in love?  It might happen, but it would take time.  Which leads me into how Oke didn't express how much time goes by, nor the age of Donnigan.  We don't know much of anything about Donnigan.  Towards the end, the total point of this book was gone.  I was hoping for more about their marriage, and the trials and tribulations of it.  I did enjoy the characters, nonetheless, and did care about their outcome, but Donnigan seems too good to be true.  I'm also glad that a book was finally written about this subject, even if it was just a storybook romance.  It still doesn't beat \\"Roses For Mama,\\" but is good all the same.  I recommend.	2003-06-10

Wells does have a gift for many voices.  I can understand why &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel&quot; was a #1 New York Times Bestseller over &quot;Little Alters Everywhere&quot;, and why &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel&quot; was turned into a movie; it had a better plot and was more intriguing.  Not the &quot;Little Alters Everywhere: A Novel&quot; didn't, but it left a lot of questions unanswered.  And, in this novel, you don't get a great sense of Vivi.  You know she is mentally unstable, but I think in Wells' follow up novel, it goes in much great and more interesting detail.  I, personally think &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel&quot; should be read before &quot;Little Alters Everywhere: A Novel.&quot; I recommend.	2003-06-08

I fell in love with this book and I liked how it was set up.  The chapters marked different events that stood out in Day's mind.  I like that over just a plain memoir, going through life in chronological order.  I liked the witty humor, and Father seemed very humorous.  This is just a great book to sit back and read the day away with! I recommend.	2003-06-05

I saw the movie before reading this play, and I love it, so I knew I would at least like the play.  I *love* the play; it's become one of my favorites.  I fell in love with all of the characters and just adore the feeling of family that comes through while reading it.  With witty dialogue (that can truly be appreciated my by people of the Jewish faith), I couldn't stop laughing, smiling, and just enjoying myself.  I recommend.	2003-05-30

After reading \\"The Crucible,\\" I thought perhaps I didn't care for Miller's take on history, but this play showed that I just don't care for him as a playwright.  I found the characters in both plays strikingly similar in their attitudes.  I've also come to the conclusion that Miller was truly a sad soul who couldn't put joy into his plays.  I could not feel for any of the characters and by the end of the play, I felt empty and confused.  I usually can visualize a play in my mind while reading it - but this time, nothing came to mind.  Just blankness and blandness.  I do not recommend.	2003-05-30

I was a little weary when beginning this story, as I feared this Tory family would be betrayed as rich, snobby, and not as humans, as that is the assumption with Tories.  Luckily, that was not the case.  I was glad that a book was finally published with loyal British people and what they dealt with through their eyes. A must read if you've read, or been reading, books about the Patriots.  I recommend.	2003-05-17

I found the characters very one dimensional, and could not develop an opinion about them.  I felt Austen shoved the opinion at us, instead of forming our own.  The way she presented the matters of pride and prejudice was very trivial and predictable.  It is certainly not worth its hype.  I do not recommend.	2003-05-11

It's been a long time since I could not put a book down, and this book broke the drought.

The children's dialogue was delightful!  So cute, yet mature.  Some parts had me thinking of what's going on in the world today, and how it applies.  I didn't feel one on one with the characters, but I did feel for them.  I'm giving it four stars because I didn't care for the shortness in chapters; that put a damper on things.

I found that Miller portrayed everyone as being naive and at times childish, and I found myself focusing on the utter stupidity of events, rather than the complexity of the characters.  Until the fourth act, I found myself bored and frustrated.  But, the pace picked up by the last act, and true drama surfaced.  With very little stage direction, I cannot be fully taken with this play.  I think it would have been better as a novel, as that is how it currently reads.  You could write a good character analysis, once you get past the yearning to scream at the characters about how wrong they are. But other than that, this play is somewhat of a letdown.  I do not recommend.	2003-03-09

There are few historical fictions for younger readers dealing with the German children of the war. One word that comes to mind to describe this book is \\"redundant.\\" We know that Korrina thinks Jew's are vile, etc., and there is no need to express that on each page; William's should have explained in greater depth *why* she felt this way, other than that she was brainwashed (there's a reason for everything). Another thing missing was why Korrina changed her mind about Jewish people. A decent book, nonetheless - I recommend.	2003-03-02

It's a quick and light read, which is enjoyable.  With plays, you need imagination, and with the stage directions and descriptions, you'll have no problem picturing the set.  I would love to see this play performed, as I am sure it'd be a hoot!  If you love plays or just what a fun read, then read this play.  I recommend.	2003-03-01

I found the writing in &quot;Rebecca&quot; very dreary and long, while &quot;Mrs. De Winter&quot; was more upbeat, in a monotone sort of way.  The plot is not a thick one, but just sums up the life the de Winter's led after the incidents at Manderly.  The ending is rather abrupt, but yet, not uncalled for.  I really don't understand why people did not appreciate this book.  Hill did a very good job continuing where du Maurier left off.  I recommend.	2003-02-15

Given what little facts, Sheri Holman did a decent job.  You get a true sense of what being a female was like during this time, and how hard it was; one couldn't follow a hobby or dream, as it was probably not feminine enough.  If anything, you'll be shown how strong women are and how much they can accomplish, with or without a man's help.  Young girl's should read this story, as Holman created a great role model in Sondok.  I recommend.	2003-02-09

I was looking forward to more history, but instead was shown a lot of scenery.  After reading this book, I felt like I walked away only reading half of his diary.  The beginning started out very good, but by the end, it was as if Lasky didn't know what to write anymore, and decided to stretch it out.  The epilogue was also a disappointment.  Not even good for beginner learners of this time in history.  I do not recommend.	2003-02-08

The ladies stock exchange was overshadowed by the outbreak of pneumonia, the auto race, and the personal lives of the characters.  The narrator switched too often, and the women had too many problems for the reader to focus on.  Just when you became interested in one life, it abruptly switched to another, and the chapters were to short, which led to an overabundance of chapters.  The ending was very sudden and too happy - don't get me wrong, I love happy endings; but, with the history of the women, it just didn't fit.  The lack of an epilogue did not help, either.  A waste of time and money.  I do not recommend.	2003-02-05

This book could have been added on to \\"The Starving Time: Elizabeth's Jamestown Colony Diary;\\" in fact, it would have been better off if it was, as \\"Season of Promise\\" can't really stand on it's own two feet.  Even though this is the longest of the three books, it feels the emptiest.  With the addition of Caleb and Mistress Whistler (Anna), you'd think there would be more action, but there isn't.  I still give this book three stars because it's apart of a good trio of books.  And, once again, there is room for another edition.  I don't recommend.	2003-01-04

Granted that it did help decipher hidden meanings behind some of the dialogue, or certain innuendo's which can go over one's head, but other than that, it was not helpful or insightful.  I think it actually took me longer to read the Spark Notes, than the actual play itself.  If you do get this book, of course you know to read &quot;Spark Notes A Man For All Seasons&quot; AFTER you have read &quot;A Man For All Seasons: A Play in Two Acts.&quot;  I do not recommend.	2002-12-20

I adore plays, and this era in time, but this play disappointed me, and I'm disappointed that I didn't enjoy it, as I had high hopes.  I looked at the play, as if I were to perform in it, and it did not strike my fancy.  With practically no stage direction, and little direction of emotion, I thought to myself how I would hate to perform it.  I do give credit for it being such a short play, when this time in history was anything but short and sweet.  I do not recommend.	2002-12-03

I expected more of a mystery, more of a mind bending plot, not endless pages of nothing happening.  The &quot;mystery&quot; did not surface until about 75 pages to the end.  The ending deeply confused me and left the story hanging.  Perhaps the &quot;sequels,&quot; which were released more than 50 years after &quot;Rebecca&quot; was published, will make things clearer.

The plot sounded very intriguing, with a one-room school being closed down when the teacher leaves, and Ida becoming the secret teacher, because she is the most knowledgeable pupil out of her classmates, but once you finish the book, you'll feel empty, as if you missed a chapter or two.  The characters were underdeveloped and the ending a little too sugar coated.  Ida's parents were one-of-a-kind during this era, as most parents didn't want their daughter going past elementary school, especially farming families.  The relationship between Tom and Ida was underdeveloped - we know they knew each other from early childhood and that they fancy each other, but that's all we know.  Miss Sedgewick wasn't portrayed accurately in my opinion - no one, no matter what era, would allow an 8th grader to teach students.  An epilogue was also lacking.  The reason I give this book three stars, and not one, is because the topic *is* interesting, in it's own, bland way.  Good for younger readers, being introduced to the 1920s life, but not a good way to acquaint yourself with Avi.  Ten years and younger - I recommend ; 11 years and older - I do not recommend.	2002-10-26

The title Harper Lee even chose was ingenious.  If more people lived by the saying \\"to kill a mockingbird would be a sin,\\" we would live in more peaceful times.

At points, the story dragged on and on and then a split second later, it jumped ahead ten days with a brief paragraph about what happened.  With barely any dialogue, diary entries, or letters, this novel only described feelings and events.

Books	1	4	7	N	N	A very poor, uninteresting historical fiction.	&quot;Into the Wilderness: The Long Hunters&quot; could have been an interesting historical fiction, as it takes place during The French &amp; Indian War, a war that isn't written about often, but it seemed to focus more on how men reacted to war, than history. At times, I was confused with the English side and French side, but a historical note would have cleared things up, but there was none.  The romance wasn't all that great, and at times interfered with the story.  The relationship between Noah and Jessica happened quickly and didn't have that &quot;courtship&quot; romance.  It seemed Noah &quot;loved&quot; Jessica because there was a resemblance to his late wife and Jessica &quot;loved&quot; Noah because she was a young, naive girl who needed to be taken care of, and was flattered that an &quot;experienced&quot; man had taken an interest in her.  Both stories, The French &amp; Indian War and the romance, didn't mix well and because of it, I really had no interest in finishing the story.  There also should have been an epilogue explaining how the war ended and how Noah and Jessica's life turned out together.  I do not recommend.	2002-09-20

Perhaps if the length of the book had been shorter, it wouldn't have seemed dull. Yep seemed more interested in war strategies then the life of Princess Red Bird. I was disappointed he did not give more detail of her schooling and life at her palace. Another major disappointment was finding out nearly all the characters in this novel were fictional. This statement should have been brought up in the beginning before one begins to read, rather than after the book is finished. The final disappointed was in the epilogue - it was very un-detailed. I do not recommend.	2002-09-14

Having never read about the yellow fever epidemic in 1793, this novel gave plenty of detail of how the young city of Philadelphia was affected by the disease, how doctors treated patients, and how quickly family and friends turned on each other.  The Appendix was very neat because it gave a brief history lesson of events and people mentioned throughout the book.  I recommend.	2002-09-04
US	36369004	RX4S0EBMTIAO	0785724524	435570549	Steal Away to Freedom	Books	2	1	3	N	N	A big disappointment.	\\"Steal Away\\" was not what I expected.  I expected more adventure and bonding between Beth and Susannah - I couldn't quite understand if they were true friends or mere acquaintances who went through a trying experience.  The concept of going back and forth from the \\"past\\" to the \\"present\\" was interesting and different, but couldn't save this book. The relationship between Mary and Free was also confusing.  I came to the conclusion that they were not fond of each other, because of Free's bitterness.  The beginning and ending letter added to the confusion and the \\"unspoken\\" words and emotions made me reread paragraphs to fully understand what happened.  The plot and the way the story was constructed was enjoyable, but the writing style used by Armstrong was annoying.  I do not recommend.	2002-09-03

At times, this book was a tad boring and the writing didn't seem realistic for an eleven-year-old boy, but nevertheless, I learned different things about the Chinese cultural.  My last complaint would be for the epilogue - it could have been more specific.  A good book for beginner learners of how and why the Chinese migrated to America during the Gold Rush - I recommend.	2002-09-03

If you think you know everything there is to know about the Boleyn's - think again.  In this novel, George was right: Mary and George Boleyn were &quot;nobody's&quot; because their sister Anne over-shined the both.  I did not know that Mary or George even existed, not to mention that Mary was King Henry's mistress or that he fathered two children with her, or how Anne caught the King's eye.  My, how the history books leave out details.  To sum this novel up: it wasn't about love, but power, and how much power was attainable, and how people would stop at nothing to get the power, castle, or title.  Mary, George, and Anne were treated like human chess pieces.  Anne checked-mate Queen Katherine and England went down hill from there.  I was given the impression that if the Boleyn's hadn't shoved their way into the King's life, he wouldn't have considered divorcing Queen Katherine, and therefore divorce wouldn't be where it is today.  The question and answer section with the author is a nice touch and the questions for the reader is a real thinker.  I recommend.	2002-08-30

While reading this book, I just didn't get the sense of \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  Perhaps because the bombing happened at the end of the book, with only a couple weeks worth of diary entries.  This wasn't the best book by Barry Denenberg, but I did get a sense of what the time was like, with gas masks, bomb shelters, and the sheer havoc in supermarkets.  I never figured out if Amber ever wrote to her friend, Allison, and if Andy ever traded that baseball card - I think the small details matter as much as the big details.  I found it interesting how the book mimicked the movie \\"Pearl Harbor\\" by using sterilized Coke bottles to keep the donated blood in.  I was disappointed with the Epilogue, since it didn't include what happened to the mother and father, the new baby, Allison, and didn't go into detail about the characters it did mention, like what happened in San Francisco.  This book will interest readers who enjoyed the movie \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  I \\"sorta\\" recommend.	2002-08-23

While reading, I forgot this novel was supposed to be about the World's Fair.  The fair wasn't the main topic until nearly the end of the story.  I would have stopped reading this book, but as always, I have high hopes and thought it would get better soon, but alas, it didn't.  Lottie and Everett seemed out of place and what happened between them was too much of a coincidence and Rosie wasn't a good lead character.  If you want to read a book about the Chicago World's Fair, then I suggest &quot;Exploring the Chicago World's Fair, 1893&quot; which is apart of the American Sisters series.  I do not recommend this book.	2002-08-23

Although it doesn't give a feel of what the trail was like, it showed unsafe traveling was, and what life was like once settling on fresh land, without a house.  Auch showed how dangerous living in the open terrain was and how blind some people were to those dangers.  I certainly recommend this book to readers who are interested in this era and I look forward to reading the rest of the series.	2002-08-21

If you're not having a problem reading &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; this will give you questions to test your knowledge of the book.  Of course, you should read the Cliffs Notes AFTER you read &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; not instead of.  I recommend.	2002-08-20

This book is very heartwarming and really shows how lucky we are to be living in this era, but also showed how family life has changed over the years.  Although at times this story was sad, the ending will lift your spirits.  The epilogue is one of the better one's I've read and the Historical Note is very educational.  I also thought it was very wise how Lasky pointed out how she mentioned some events that did not occur during the year 1932, but put them in the story to make the plot thicker.

This book seemed very bland compared to the rest of The Royal Diaries series.  At times, I became bored and confused with the characters, especially with the \\"Mary's.\\"  I felt I learned more about the life of Mary through reading \\"Queen's Own Fool: A Novel of Mary Queen of Scots.\\"  I recommend this for youth who are interested in Mary, Queen of Scots, as this is a good beginner's book, but for those either more educated or wanting to become more educated about Mary, I do not recommend.	2002-08-15

I think Erika Tamar was successful in portraying how out of place Diedre O'Rourke was when she was adopted.  She also makes the reader feel happy at Diedre's happiness.  This book shows how some kids were unfortunate in their new adopted homes, while other's had a better life than they had before they were adopted.  The author's note in the back was very educational and informative.  I just wish Tamar had included an Epilogue.  Now I wish she will make a sequel or a spin-off with Rosie France.  I recommend.	2002-08-15

Giving just the right amount of details, Philbrick was able to show the horrors the emigrants suffered, while trying to make a new life in California.  I read this book after \\"Against All Odds: The Lucy Scott Mitchum Story\\" which always referred to what happened to The Donner Party.  Having not knowing what happened exactly, this book helped me understand why they were so scared.  The historical note at the end was very, very interesting, but not for readers with weak stomachs (it doesn't go into great detail, but could let your imagination go wild.).  I most definitely recommend.	2002-08-12

For historical points, this book is lacking, until the Historical Note at the end of the story.  Read \\"The Winter of Red Snow: The Revolutionary War Diary of Abigail Jane Stewart, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, 1777,\\" also by Gregory, with or instead of this book, to get a bigger and better picture of The Revolutionary War.

You can see the Victorian era from advertisements of food, fashion, photography, newspapers, household items, cleaning supplies, toiletry items, cigarettes, music, scrapbook supplies, flower seeds, puzzles, toys, reading materiel, sports, bicycles, traveling, post cards, Christmas cards, souvenirs, and the military.

On it's own, it is an OK story.  The original \\"Time\\" characters didn't evolve much - they went through the same exact emotions as in the previous stories: \\"I wish I hadn't left you....,\\" \\"You need to go back to your own Time.....,\\" \\"I wish you hadn't left.....,\\" etc.  At first, I thought Camilla was the main character and then I though Renifer was the main character.  Then, I began to wonder *who* was the main character?  The historical elements were interesting, but at times confusing.  How could the present be the future, if the past hadn't happened that way yet?  That's what this book felt like at times.  I felt that Cooney didn't really know how to end the series, and had to make \\"soap opera\\" plots.    The reincarnated Strat was an interesting addition and I wish there had been more of him in the story.  There is plenty of room for another addition to this series, and if there is, I hope there will be more of Strat reincarnated.  I suppose I recommend.	2002-07-30

The Cliffs Notes are very helpful and make this story even more interesting.  I didn't feel that I knew the characters, but had feelings about them.  I pitied Gatsby, was annoyed with Daisy, aggravated with Tom, irritated about Jordan, and admired Nick.  Taking place during the Jazz Age, Fitzgerald made it seem The Depression might be welcomed, so it can put people in their places.  I felt that F. Scott Fitzgerald was writing a semi-biography about himself, perhaps unknowingly.  A wonderful read - I recommend.	2002-07-29

This novel made me think constantly!  How can a man, aged 41, even think of having a love affair with a 15-year-old girl - a girl only a few years older than his oldest daughter!  The writing was good, but after reading this novel, I couldn't say I believed Olympia truly loved John (Haskell) - perhaps she was just exploring and didn't know what love was, other than intimacy - nor did I believe that Haskell truly loved Olympia - perhaps he just wanted someone young and pure.  Or, perhaps I am looking too psychological into this and they did love each other.  I began to wonder how the custody case would hold up in today's court - I guess times haven't changed, now have they?  It seemed Anita Shreve was mimicking they style of the old classics, with love and betrayal in the 1800 and 1900s.  Nonetheless, an intriguing story - I recommend.	2002-07-22

The beginning gave Nell's routine and no hint of the Plague.  By the time the Plague occurred, I had lost interest in the book.  By the time I became interested in the novel, it was over.  The entire book should have given a blow-by-blow experience of what happened.  On the plus side, this book is good for young readers interested in this era.  Good for preteens: I recommend; not good for 13+: I do not recommend.	2002-07-17
US	36369004	R24LMHRUFPT10M	0060287179	729930931	If Ever I Return Again	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Extremely dull.	\\"If Ever I Return Again\\" felt like a very incomplete book.  All the action was clumped at the end, at the end of a two-year voyage.  To make it interesting, Celia should have drawn things on the letters she was sending to her cousin, Abigail - since she said she enjoyed drawing.  The crewmembers were underdeveloped - we only heard about Mr. Grimes, Isaac, and Nate in great detail.  Surely there must have been other men Celia conversed with on the ship, of interest?  The relationship between Celia and her mother was very predictable and the mystery of Celia's father's first wife was not really a mystery.  I wish there had been more colorful explanations of the ocean, whales, dolphins, the ship, and hurricane.  I do not recommend.	2002-07-16

This book had none stop action and was interesting.  Todd could have been better developed, but that is my only complaint.  I think Hiram Stratton, Sr., was shown to be a heartless human being better in this book than in the other two \\"Time\\" novels combined.  I hope in the last book in this quad series, it will show why both Annie AND Todd were able to time travel - is it hereditary or just pure luck?  I guess only *time* will tell......

Turner!	\\"These Is My Words: The Diary of Sarah Agnes Prine, 1881-1901 Arizona Territories\\" was a superb historical fiction novel written in the style of a diary. Turner did a wonderful job showing the progression in Sarah's spelling, punctuation, grammar, and most importantly, how she matured through the 20 years she wrote in her diary. I was able to feel the happiness, sadness, and anger Sarah went through! You were able to tell that Sarah and Jack were very much in love, and I was so, so sad with the ending! This book is good for readers who feel they are too old of the \\"Dear America\\" series, but still like reading historical fiction through a diary. I cannot wait until Nancy E. Turner's next novel! I recommend!	2002-07-11

The story was very unfulfilling and I was left with this feeling that I missed 100 pages somehow.  The beginning was very jumbled and I couldn't figure out where Cooney was going.  I thought \\"Out of Time\\" would pick up *right* where \\"Both Sides of Time\\" left off - with Annie in that tornado tunnel type thing.  Everything good about \\"Both Sides of Time\\" was left out of \\"Out of Time.\\"  Nothing was accomplished in this novel but frustration!  Nevertheless, I'll be reading the sequel to this.  I do not recommend.	2002-07-07

From the cover of the book and the summary, you'd think it would be Ariana, but the plot seemed to focus more on Laramie.   I find it hard to believe that Laramie was not a harden outlaw, since he was raised with a bunch of hard outlaws.  The relationship between Ariana and Laramie seemed unrealistic, but that's where the fiction comes into play.  The title threw me off a little - the &quot;gown of Spanish lace&quot; was not introduced until the very end.  All in all, it's a good book.  I recommend.	2002-07-06

I enjoyed &quot;Roses For Mama,&quot; by Oke, much more. The plot seemed more relevant of today's family situations - I found that ironic.  It seems Janette Oke didn't know if she wanted to focus on Sarah or Rebecca.  It shifted main characters all of a sudden, with no hint of it.  I couldn't feel for the characters - I don't think Oke developed them well, they had no dimension.  It felt like Seth was thrown in the story to help the ending along.  I didn't understand why Sarah would finally give into hiring help, when for more than 10 years she was against it - it didn't make sense.  The ending came very fast and abruptly, without a sense of closure - an Epilogue would have been helpful.  I do not recommend.	2002-07-04
US	36369004	R2KXLDSQ5UJT55	0613357310	840211850	In the Stone Circle	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Entertaining.	\\"In the Stone Circle\\" is more of a mystery than a horror story, with a touch of historical facts.  The story is thought provoking, but not very deep.  A Ouija board could have been an interesting addition in finding out who was trying to contact Cristyn.  There are plenty of witty, sarcastic lines in this book, but younger readers may not understand them.  Elizabeth Cody Kimmel accurately portrayed teenagers under stress, without making them seem ditzy.  At times, Cristyn seemed a bit too mature for a fourteen-year old, but was a perfect match to Miranda, who was a very childish fourteen-year old.  Near the end of the book, it got a little confusing - that's my major complaint.  Now for nitpicking: Crystin is the most common/semi-correct way of spelling Christine in Welsh - not Cristyn.  But, Crystin might be the \\"modern\\" version.  This is a good book to read on a rainy day.  I recommend.	2002-07-03

There were times while reading it I felt lost, for example Sarah's abusive father.  I would have liked if there had been a scene with them together, or perhaps a detailed flashback.  I would have also liked it if Sarah wrote home to her brother, Ben, in secret.  That might have given the story more depth.  My final complaint is when she goes \\"undercover\\" - it became very confusing, and I think that is what Rinaldi wanted.  This story really showed how women can pull their own, just as good as men.  I don't think this will be Ann Rinaldi's most memorable novel, but certainly one that deserves to be read.  I recommend.	2002-07-01

Under the circumstances, I understand that Dora wouldn't be running with joy throughout the fair, but still, have her smile at the sights and sounds every so often.  I find it hard to believe they would build a fair, which reminds me of a modern theme park from today, and then tear it down - how sad.  Also, we never found out why Da Pomeroy's letters never made it to his wife and children, what job Mama Pomeroy took to make money for the rent and food, after she quit being Little Egypt, etc.  I enjoy Laurie Lawlor's writing, but I am disappointed with the American Sisters series for two reasons: there isn't an Epilogue, so you haven't a clue how the Pomeroy's fair in the future, and second there isn't a historical explanation of the fair.  If you don't care to learn about the historical facts of the Chicago World's in 1893, but just want to see what it was like from a child's point of view, then I recommend it - if you want to learn history, then don't bother.	2002-06-30

I've never read a book about the Great Hunger and I am now very interested in this topic, as result of this novel.  Patricia Reilly Giff gave the perfect amount of detail and emotion to conjure up pictures in one's mind.  I was able to feel everyone's pain and hunger.  This should also be required reading in school.  I just wish Giff put in an Epilogue, just for some closure.  You can tell this story meant a lot to the author, by her note at the end of the story.

The story will keep your attention and is a quick read.  This book is too young for me, but I still enjoyed it.  I really felt torn between the mother's feeling of telling the news and freedom of speech, but also felt for Maria, who felt that if her mother published articles that the community wouldn't like, they wouldn't get the newspaper contract again, which would lead to losing everything.  What is great about the \\"Colonial Willamsburg\\" series is that readers are learning about ordinary people who really existed.  Without this series, I doubt these people, like Maria, would get acknowledge for their hard working lives.  After finding out Maria's life in the epilogue, I felt sorry for her and her losses.  I recommend.	2002-06-23

What kept me going was to see what happened to everyone.  The characters were developed well.  There's nothing special about them, but you'll care about them and their outcome by the end of the story.  It seemed the murder was just thrown in there to give the story body (although it did show the power of women) - the whole story should have been dedicated to it, in my opinion.  I did wonder if Cooney exaggerated how women were treated in the 1890s; she made it sound like women would get the vapors if they blinked, which would cause the men to say don't blink. One thing Caroline B. Cooney did right, was the ending - it'll make you want to read the rest of the series - something I will most certainly do.  I recommend.	2002-06-21
US	36369004	R2TC1J91I7RKSV	0698118073	375920753	Hope's Crossing	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A good book.	\\"Hope's Crossing\\" was a neatly told historical fiction with the twist and turns neatly put - in other words, it's predictable.  Not too many Revolutionary War books deal with child kidnapping, so this may open your eyes to that bit of knowledge.  I don't really think that they would kidnap a child under those circumstances, say they wanted ransom, but leave know hint of where to give the ransom.  The ending came a little too quick and easy; there should have been some more obstacles for Hope.  The epilogue was very short, and only gave historical facts, not what happened to the people in the book.  From the author's note, I presume that she borrowed the name Wakeman, since Joan Elizabeth Goodman mentioned how she grew up with Wakeman's.  A decent historical fiction, as long as you don't analyze it too much.  I recommend.	2002-06-19

Having not know anything about Phillis Wheatley, this book told me everything I could possibly ever want to know.  The great thing about Rinaldi's books is, that at the end of the story, she tells you what really happened, what didn't happen, who is real, and who is fictional - something many Historical Fiction authors do not do often.  The only thing I didn't like was how it seemed Ann Rinaldi did not know if she wanted to make us believe Phillis was a spoiled brat or a young girl who didn't know any better.  I still give this book five stars, since this story was told quite well.  I recommend.	2002-06-17

I felt that the story was a bit redundant and unclear in parts.  The descriptions of the places he went to and of what he saw, are what made the chapters the length they are - without them, it would be considered a short story.  I do not recommend.	2002-06-15

Unlike many other Oregon Trail inspired books, this story deals with the process in buying land and living in a soddy.  This book was very redundant and lacked character development.  Topics were mentioned, but then dropped: example Abbie's piano, their old house, family members stricken with cholera, By's family, etc.  If these potential story lines had been expounded on, the book would have been much better.

The characters are very complex, but not too complex so that you don't feel for them.  At some parts I wanted to just scream at the characters what really happened in a situation -- that's how much you can get caught up in this novel.  I think the back-flashes and switching of characters keep the book fresh.  I did wish Schwarz put in an Epilogue, or perhaps she'll make a sequel.  Whether or not you read this book for a book club, answer the book club questions -- it'll get you thinking even more.  I look forward to Christina Schwarz's next book.  I recommend.	2002-05-27

The witty lines and fasted paced scenes (yes, scenes in writing can be fast paced.) will keep your attention constantly. This play may run long, when seen on the stage, but is great nonetheless. I recommend.	2002-05-27
US	36369004	R24HRF7ZV0MIN0	0786823607	298785649	My Town	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Such a cute book.	\\"My Town\\" is a great little book. The story is simple, but it has big meaning in it. The dogs are just wonderful and they'll bring a smile to your face. I recommend.	2002-05-26

Need a pick-me-up?  Get the \\"Baby Blues\\" books!  I recommend!	2002-05-23

Makes a nice coffee table book.  If you like celebrities and Hollywood, get this book, no matter what the year is currently.  I recommend.	2002-05-23
US	36369004	R1HS414OU6AJM1	1585010081	123584393	Blood Guts and Tears	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Unbelievable!	&quot;Wow&quot; is the only word to describe &quot;Blood Guts &amp; Tears&quot;!  If you want to become a paramedic, firefighter, or SWAT team member, read this book first, to see if you have what it takes!  It not only gives you cases, but the thoughts and emotions Brent Braunworth went through, which I think is great.  It's a short book, but leaves a lasting impression.  I recommend!	2002-05-22
US	36369004	RFTUPD99POF46	0786889896	406006732	Gone in 60 Seconds Movie Tie-In	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Read an entertaining movie!	I enjoyed the movie \\"Gone in 60 Seconds,\\" so I decided to read the book version. There are a couple added 'scenes,' but other than that, you're reading the movie! For some reason, I suggest you see the movie first, to better visualize what's going on. I recommend.	2002-05-22
US	36369004	R2SP9JU6ND2VNK	0806977736	762036958	The Hidden Meaning of Dreams	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Dream a little dream.....	&quot;The Hidden Meaning of Dreams&quot; is a very interesting book -- now if only I can remember my dreams to look them up!  My only complaint is the glossary, because it doesn't give you page numbers, and when you go to a certain topic and then tells you to go somewhere else, they don't give you the page number.  Other than that, it's a good book.  I recommend.	2002-05-22
US	36369004	RTB39MLBMND42	0345342968	383457570	Fahrenheit 451	Books	1	7	45	N	N	This book is not &quot;hot.&quot;	I enjoy historical fictions, so I knew &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was not my style, but I thought I would give it a go anyway.  Well, I hated it.  I did not like Ray Bradbury's style and I think he needs help!  Who in their right mind would think of our world becoming so controlling and horrible?  There are a lot of unanswered questions and undefined terms in this book, so you better get the Cliff's Notes, because without them, you'll be lost. Do not be surprised if you do not finish this book quickly, either!  I did find the subject of book banning and censorship interesting, but I think it could have been told differently.  I do not recommend this book!	2002-05-22
US	36369004	R3KH2VBX26IBUX	0809238969	928120453	She started it!: A Baby blues cartoon collection	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Very funny!	\\"Baby Blues\\" is the funniest comic strip!  I missed the early ones, so I'm glad I found \\"She started it!: a Baby blues cartoon collection.\\"  The situations this family gets into is priceless!  When you're feeling 'blue,' grab this book and your spirits will be lifted!  I recommend.	2002-05-22
US	36369004	R3CG6NITDSYLQT	0590510789	515720464	My Name Is America: The Journal Of Jasper Jonathan Pierce, A Pilgrim Boy	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A readable book.	Ann Rinaldi is one of my favorite author's, so I grabbed \\"The Journal of Jasper Jonathan Pierce: A Pilgrim Boy\\" as fast as I could.  Most Mayflower stories are about life on the boat itself, while this book told about life on the Mayflower, life on their new land, and meeting with the Indians.  It did drag at times, but nonetheless, it kept my attention.  A great way to learn history.  I recommend.	2002-05-22
US	36369004	R1B8NGHCJY431D	0882435205	300589682	The Joy of Signing (Second Edition)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not good, but not bad.	&quot;The Joy of Signing: The Illustrated Guide for Mastering Sign Language and the Manual Alphabet&quot; is an &quot;OK&quot; book.  Once you get past Chapter 1, the signs have numerous meanings (5 or 6 words mean the same sign -- happy, joyful, glad, blissful, delighted, and merry all for one sign -- which wouldn't be too bad, until you get to the workbooks) and some of the signs are very similar visually.  I am torn whether to recommend this or not -- it's a 50/50 chance whether you'll like it or not.	2002-05-22
US	36369004	R1Y5HQLRY6568H	0060929847	868213085	Our Town (Perennial Classics)	Books	1	9	28	N	N	&quot;Our Town&quot; is nothing special	Let me start off by saying that I love plays and was intrigued to hear that this play did not use props or sets. Thornton Wilder purposely underdeveloped the characters and made it lacking, but this was beyond underdevelopment and lacking -- why bother writing a play?  The acts are very short, emotionless, and unmemorable and I hated the characters, because they were uncaring.  Why &quot;Our Town&quot; is required reading for high school and America's favorite drama, I do not know - I didn't get anything out of it besides boredom and confusion.  I do not recommend it.	2002-05-22
US	36369004	R3MP4KJ286RABL	0440227534	935109813	Number the Stars	Books	5	0	1	N	N	A wonderful book!	I first read \\"Number the Stars\\" in 5th grade and I was hooked on learning about the Holocaust ever since.  This book is told wonderfully and is a good book for a beginner learner of the Holocaust. It tells about the Holocaust, but also about what happened to Jewish people outside of the concentration camps.  A fantastic book - I recommend!	2002-05-22
US	36369004	R10ZEQX927UL5	0882435388	899626164	The Joy of Signing Puzzle Book 2	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A decent workbook.	&quot;The Joy of Signing Puzzle Book 2&quot; can be frustrating at times, but in the end, it's a good way to see if you're grasping what you're learning from &quot;The Joy of Signing: The Illustrated Guide for Mastering Sign Language and the Manual Alphabet.&quot;  My complaints are for the word searches: the letters are in finger-signs and since they're on the small side, some of the letters look alike, like A's, E's, and O's.  Also, since some signs have multiple meanings, you have to look up each word, per sign, in the search, which gets very tiring.  Other than that, it's a good workbook.  I recommend.	2002-05-22
US	36369004	RQA7MS0DDE4LA	0684801221	737092002	The Old Man and The Sea	Books	1	7	20	N	N	"The Old Man and the Snore."	\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" should be changed to \\"The Old Man and the Snore.\\"  This book doesn't even deserve 1 star.  Symbolism is flowing faster than a faucet in this book, so be prepared.  Read this book when you are wide-awake, as you may fall asleep when the Old Man is talking to himself, when he is alone at sea.  Again, this is another book I do not understand why is required reading in high school, as I got nothing out of it but a good nap.  I do not recommend.	2002-05-22
US	36369004	R24M93L8DFSHA3	0689804466	337036846	Izzy, Willy-Nilly	Books	5	3	5	N	N	One of the TOP books on my list!	Izzy, Willy-Nilly is a rude awakening kind of book!  This story will make you think twice about drinking and driving.  Not only is Izzy affected by her disability, but her family and friends are also affected as well.  I hope they make this book into a movie, or at least a TV movie, as I think this is a must for every young driver to see.  I also hope this becomes required reading in high school, or at least driving-Ed.  I most certainly recommend this book!	2002-05-22
US	36369004	R2HB0P8QUU0SKM	0689840322	90900075	The Vandemark Mummy	Books	3	1	2	N	N	An "OK" book	I read \\"The Vandemark Mummy\\" after reading \\"Izzy, Willy-Nilly,\\" because I enjoyed Cynthia Voigt's writing.  This book is just a fun book to read if you have nothing else to read or do.  \\"The Vandemark Mummy,\\" is a young book with a kiddy plot, so don't expect anything major.	2002-05-22

You would still laugh if you were to skip the words and just look at the facial expressions!  I find that in the earlier \\"Garfield's,\\" there were more witty one-liners, which are shown in this book.  I recommend!	2002-05-22
US	36369004	R15F0TMT4SLS54	0618002227	669379389	The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, Part 1)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Not my style.	I do not like mythical books, so I knew I was in for it when I started &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;  I became interested in the story 100 pages before it ended (I became very bored during the traveling).  The names are a lot of fun, though!  Just to say them aloud is a fun challenge!  If you love Tolkein and mythical stuff, then this is the book for you; if not, don't even read this if you are dared.	2002-05-22
