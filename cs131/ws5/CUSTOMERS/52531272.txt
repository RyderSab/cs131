After finishing \\"Tara Road\\", I started \\"Scarlet Feather\\"--& both these books I read a couple of years after reading earlier (much better, as I see it) Maeve Binchy books- such as \\"Circle of friends\\", \\"Glass lake\\", \\"Evening class\\" etc. The difference between earlier & later Binchy books is enormous. I believe the earlier books started out much more naturally, & the \\"formula\\" that everyone talks about, Binchy's usual multiple-character-formula probably was an original, creative device then. Later on, with \\"Tara Road\\" & now (even more) with \\"Scarlet Feather\\", Binchy's formula seems much more like an old & tired plot device, more like a gimmick  than anything else.    The Binchy formula is ever present here: Lots of characters. 2 central characters (Cathy & Tom) who are trying to set up their own catering business in Dublin. A huge (TOO huge) cast of supporting characters. A couple of people who are the obvious villains in the story (but they're so predictably...villainous that it all gets very boring very soon). Hints at side-stories that, at some point, get explained. I could go on & on, since lately Binchy's novels seem to be a mixing up of the same elements, again & again.    What I didn't like, specifically, is  a) the predictability of the story  b) the fact that several lose ends were left there, hanging open. For example, the Amanda-story, the Shona story, the actual early relationship between Cathy & Neil, the relationship between Cathy & her mother-in-law etc etc. There are too many to mention. Interesting little pieces of stories that never get developed, & we're left with questions.  c) the holier-than-thou attitude of Cathy. She's TOO perfect for my own taste, a little humourless & she's got a chip on her shoulder all the time.    What I did like were the delicious descriptions of food that the catering company produces! MMMMMMmm....Read \\"Scarlet feather\\" with low expectations, just as a book-to-read-by-the-beach, & mostly for the great food!	2002-08-25

At least it's the very first book by her that I read, years ago. A couple of days ago I decided to re-read it, after finishing (& liking) \\"Long time no see\\". Well, \\"Compromising positions\\" is as good, as easy-to-read as I recalled...but then again, I've got a soft spot for all Susan Isaacs books!<br />In \\"Compromising positions\\" we meet Judith Singer for the first time. An intelligent, attractive (although not exceedingly so), funny & energetic lady. A historian turned housewife & mother, & bored stiff by life in the suburbs. Judith is going from day to day, living with Bob, in a kind of boring but pretty stable marriage, looking after her young kids, & taking pleasure in long, witty conversations with her intelligent & sassy friend, Nancy. At some point, she hears about the murder of the local periodontist & as it turns out, womanizer. The case interests her, & suddenly she finds herself deeply involved in the investigation. And also deeply involved with a certain person who has something to do with the investigation, but that I'll leave you to find out for yourself.<br />\\"Compromising positions\\" is a wonderful, easy read about life in the suburbs, life in the 70s, & life for a bored housewife who yearns for intellectual stimulation. I think this is the first book where Isaacs shows her talent & her ability to draw believable & enjoyable characters. And as a footnote, I'd have to say that in Isaacs work I've read some of the best, funniest & most sexy love affairs that I've found in the book world!! Sit back & enjoy...	2002-07-30
US	52531272	R2PLO18STIKHDA	0440235596	870989999	Tara Road (Oprah's Book Club)	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Been there, done that...	Here's something bizarre: while reading &quot;Tara Road&quot;, the lyrics of an old, cheesy pop song kept coming to me. They go something like this: &quot;words don't come easy to me...&quot; Well, these lyrics stuck to my head, I think, because it's the complete opposite with Binchy. Words come easy, very easy to her!! This book is long, &amp; I think definitely too long for the actual content. <br />The story is not bad at all: Two women, Ria &amp; Marilyn. One Irish, living in Dublin. The other American, living in Stoneyfield or whatever it's called. Both trapped in a very bad situation, a life crisis of some sort. So far, so good. There's also a large supporting cast of characters, which are all vividly drawn, as are the main characters. One basic characteristic of all Binchy's books is the fact that the reader is instantly drawn in the characters' world, in their everyday lives. This happens in &quot;Tara Road&quot; too...But there's a catch: these everyday lives of these everyday people are, I'm afraid, not that interesting.<br />One thing that disappointed me is Ria's stupidity, or naivite (if I want to be kinder). All sorts of cheating &amp; infidelity &amp; deceit happens under her nose. But Ria, angelic Ria, doesn't understand a thing. She keeps on cooking &amp; baking in her delightful, homey, filled-with-people kitchen, &amp; doesn't have a clue about anything. This to me is, to say the least, insulting to the reader's intelligence. I mean, come on, how stupid can this woman be? And OK, she's naive, she's innocent, she's angelic &amp; only thinks kind thoughts. But Binchy could at least give us a satisfying ending. I won't go into details, but I can say this: there's no sense of closure in the end, no sense of understanding or seeing things clearly. Yes, Ria has grown &amp; changed after coming back from the States. But her blindness when it comes to her husband is very much the same.<br />As for the other main character, Marilyn, I think she's probablythrown in the story to (supposedly) make it more colourful, more international. But, as many reviewers have noted, Marilyn &amp; her American friends use, surprisingly, Irish expressions! Plus, there's essentially no description of America &amp; Ria's surroundings there, except of course a detailed description of Marilyn's house.<br />It may sound that I didn't like the book: it's not true, I did enjoy it &amp; read it easily in a couple of days, at the beach. But if I had to say one thing about it, it would be that this is a retelling of the same old story that Binchy writes. After reading some of her other books, &quot;Tara Road&quot; seemed like words, words, words that came to no satisfying conclusion...	2002-07-14

Geneen Roth's books had been recommended to me for ages, so I decided I should start with this one: maybe it was the wrong choice as an introduction to her work, maybe not. I guess I'll find out after reading the rest of her books.<br />Mind you, this is NOT a disappointing book: Not at all. It contains good, very useful ideas, and it makes clear points. The basic, no-diet philosophy of Roth is valid &amp; makes sense. And since this is a self-help book, it helps that the author uses examples, little stories, &amp; catchy titles. From cover to cover, it can be read in a couple of hours, but I think it's better to read the ideas more slowly, savouring &amp; trying to understand each one better. <br />&quot;When you eat at the refrigerator...&quot; is NOT a bad book: it's just that these things have been said before, &amp; (in my opinion) much better, for example, by Susie Orbach. Maybe Orbach concetrates more on the theoretical part &amp; Roth tackles the more practical, self-help part. I don't know. And maybe Roth has covered more theory in her other books. But this book, for me, was lacking in theoretical explanation of the ideas presented, &amp; so most of these ideas seemed like little gimmicks to me. But, as a beginnning book, a book of ideas that can lead to other similar books, it's not bad.	2002-05-03

True up to a point. The high-rating reviews talked about an extremely funny, sad but also tender, true-to-life book. Also true up to a point. In my opinion, the &quot;Nanny diaries&quot; fits none of the 2 above categories: you surely know by now that it's an expose on Upper-East-Side NY life, about parents horribly neglecting their children &amp; essentially delegating their parental responsibilities completely to nannies. Since these kinds of parents do exist, it's interesting to read about them. But the book tends to take the point too far. <br />People in the book, after a certain point, seem like caricatures of themselves. Even Nanny, who is portrayed as far too perfect, especially compared to Mrs X who is portrayed as far too horrible: in real life people tend to have their pluses &amp; minuses, even horrible people like Mrs X...The book shows no nuances, whatsovever. <br />The writers are out to prove a point, &amp; in the beginning, yes, the book is funny &amp; insightful. But after the point is proven (more than proven) the book gets boring &amp; repetitive. By the end of the book, I was feeling cheated- where was the humour of the beginning? where was the sarcasm? only bitterness (&amp; helplessness) was left....and yes, sadness about a very bad situation: but this sadness could be shown through much more realistic events. The ending comes abruptly, as if the writers had just lost steam &amp; wanted to get the book out of the way. <br />The &quot;Nanny Diaries&quot; is based on a good idea, &amp; contains some good, funny, sarcastic writing (especially in the beginning). Once you get past the good, opening parts, there's not much there.	2002-05-02

Well, not really... But true up to a point. Being afraid of a disease, be it cancer, AIDS, or whatever else, can be debilitating. And who of us doesn't know people that are scared to death of cancer, or of AIDS? And how can we all not be scared (maybe even terrified) of these diseases, when in our eyes they're not just diseases but are loaded with a whole lot of different meanings, mainly linked to death...<br /><br />Susan Sontag's essay on cancer (& her later essay on AIDS) deal with these diseases as metaphors of whatever is bad, evil, reprehensible, sinful about human experience. Especially with cancer, the metaphor is more poignant, since, cancer still has unknown causes, at least up to a point: of course cancer now is much better understood, but in '78, when Sontag wrote the first essay, cancer was mostly unknown territory. Obviously, when we're talking about unknown territory, unknown (& mysterious) causes, there's a lot of theoretizing & projecting: anyone can project their own ideas on this white wall of ignorance. And so people 'fight' cancer, 'win the battle' against cancer, 'have cancer personalities', 'cause' their cancer or whatever else. It was even worse with AIDS, especially in the '80s: then it was widely (& stupidely) believed that this new disease was the payback for the free sexuality of the '70s, & especially of the sexuality of homosexuals.<br /><br />Susan Sontag's essays tackle these issues & show the metaphors & prejudices of illness as what they are. They are important, clearly-written essays, & if today some of these ideas appear obvious or widely known, remember that Sontag talked about these things many years ago, being one of the first people to address the issue.	2002-04-20

Then, this year, I had to take a course at university about the history of psychoanalysis: & so I dug out Joseph Schwartz's book, & read it in one weekend. I was suprised how freshly & clearly written the book is. Even difficult, complicated concepts are explained in a good way, that makes you want to continue exploring the field of psychoanalysis, after finishing this book.<br />\\"Cassandra's daughter\\" reads like a story with a beginning, middle & end, & not at all like a dry, boring history. From the beginnings of psychoanalysis with Sigmund Freud, to today's struggles & questions, Schwartz makes a good case of why psychoanalysis is important & interesting. He talks about what its contributions have been so far, & what kind of contributions it can make from now on. Sure, certain \\"schools\\" of psychoanalysis are given less space than others in the book. And it's also true that Schwartz has strong opinions & expresses them clearly, showing his own preferances, & using arguments to support his views: but I don't find this negative--on the contrary, it's refreshing to read a history written from a particular point of view. After all, histories are always written from a particular point of view, even when there's a big struggle towards a so-called \\"objectivity\\": Schwartz has no such illusions, & writes making his own voice very clear. It's much more 'fresh' & original this way, since it's one thing to simply & dryly describe the facts--& another thing to try to explain the facts, giving meaning to the story & the events.	2002-03-18

All main characters come out flat (especially Tempe, the forensic anthropologist who is the main character).<br />2) Something else about the bad writing: what annoyed me especially was the constant use of flowery comparisons. Also, the extremely long-winded descriptions of actions &amp; places, which made me skip whole paragraphs at a time.<br />3) OK, if we get past the lack of characterization issue &amp; the bad writing, we get to the actual plot, which of course is essential in a crime novel: &quot;Deja Dead&quot; has a plot that makes you want to scream &quot;I've read this book before- many many times!&quot; It's a book that's far from original, especially the cliche of the main heroine getting in harm's way.<br />4)Again, concerning the plot: there are lots of holes in the plot, such as the monkey &amp; the biologist (I kept turning back to see if maybe I'd missed crucial points). There are also loads of characters who keep appearing &amp; disappearing, with no apparent reason--for example, Tempe's daughter, Katy, whose existence serves no other purpose than simply for the main character to...have a daughter!<br />5) Tempe Brennan oversteps the limits / boundaries of her job description all the time, during the investigation described in this novel. She is a forensic anthropologist, &amp; yet acts as a detective, showing a disturbing lack of common sense: for example, she keeps going to dangerous places alone (always at night!) &amp; then is surprised &amp; annoyed when the detectives whose job description says they have to solve this case are angry at her!  There's no background as to why Claudel dislikes her, some reader mentioned: but how can he NOT dislike her, when she keeps stealing his job from under his nose? It's such a cliche when all the detectives are stupid &amp; our heroine is the only intelligent one...<br />6) French is thrown in casually from time to time. This I didn't mind. What I did mind was that it was apparent that this was done simply to show that Montreal is where the story takes place. No other descriptions of Montreal exist, no &quot;feeling&quot; of Quebec comes out of this story.<br />7) Another point that many readers have mentioned is that the book is FULL OF technical details. These are interesting, but tend to be far too many. 5 or 6 pages full of descriptions of how saws work? Please!!<br />8) Tempe's relationship with Gabby is inexplicable &amp; annoying. The crazy scenes that take place between them (especially the ones where Gabby appears in the middle of the night, out of nowhere) are hard to understand, &amp; are never properly explained.<br />9) Last point: Of course &quot;Deja Dead&quot; is being constantly compared to Patricia Cornwell's books. Even though the Scarpetta novels keep getting worse &amp; worse, I still find them far more original &amp; fast paced.	2002-03-02
US	52531272	R3QF24DU40U3KG	0684801566	400377280	Who Stole Feminism?: How Women Have Betrayed Women	Books	3	60	78	N	N	interesting, thought provoking book with some flaws	\\"Why are certain feminists so eager to put men in a bad light\\"? This is one of the first questions asked by Christina Hoff Sommers, philosophy professor & equity-feminist (as she calls herself) in the preface of the book \\"Who stole feminism?\\". Sommers makes many interesting points in her book, mainly that gender-feminists are different from equity-feminists: the latter are more mainstream, don't hate men, believe women have come a long way, & oppose the \\"male hegemony\\" talk that gender-feminists believe in.<br />So far, so good....Sommers continues by putting in the spotlight certain studies & reports, all produced by gender-feminists, & proves (or attempts to prove) their fallacy. Good examples of biased studies are the March of Dimes study, the \\"women self-esteem\\" study, the depression study & some others, which all prove to have fatal flaws in their reasoning. One valid point that Sommers makes is that radical feminism is a little bit like religion- it tends to accept no criticism, & it tends to see all things through a specific, coloured lense. This is the lense through science itself is seen, as is literature, & even art (which thrives, necessarily, through freedom of expression & cannot & should not be stifled, whatever the reason).<br />Sommers mentions linguistic reform (a funny example is the ludicrous word \\"ovular\\" in place of \\"seminar\\"), women's studies classes, & - most importantly- the dangerous idea that western civilization itself, & scientific thinking has something inherently \\"masculine\\" about it, whereas \\"feminine\\" thinking is \\"emotional\\" & \\"connected\\". What certain gender-feminists propose, in a word, is that there is a \\"female way of knowing\\" which seems dangerously close to phallocentric beliefs: \\"women think differently, are made for different roles, so they should stay home & raise the kids\\" etc. So, Christina Hoff Sommers has a point: every social movement has to be able to take criticism, both from within & (most importantly) from outside. On the other hand, Sommers mostly mentions only extreme cases of gender-feminism, & I'm sure there are voices of dissent within the feminist movement, which she fails to aknowledge (except in cases such as Camille Paglia's opinions, which are hardly orthodox feminist opinions).<br />My major complaint with the book is this: at some point, Sommers mentions how Susan Faludi (a good example of her own definition of gender-feminim) has \\"painted herself into a position that allows no room for criticism\\". But how guilty is Sommers of the same sin? Her whole book is full of evidence of one, & only one central thesis. Yes, she says she's a feminist, but she never talks about real problems of real women: she mostly points out how far women have come. It's not enough to just mention that equity feminists have different, more mainstream opinions. She should be able to point out how equity feminists go about achieving change, what their activities & plans are when it comes to fighting for even more equality for women. Unfortunately, Sommers never really gets into this issue. <br />Also, parts of her own statistics & arguments are flawed, as flawed as some of the gender-feminists' reasoning. For example, she mentions \\"probably 100 women dying from anorexia a year in the US\\" (as opposed to the much higher numbers that Naomi Wolf had cited in the Beauty Myth- numbers that she later admitted were wrong): 100 women is definitely not the correct number either though, since most women who die of anorexia complications have a different etiology in their death certificates. So, sadly, Sommers also \\"overlooks evidence that does not fit her puzzle\\", as she accuses most gender-feminists of doing.<br />\\"Who stole feminism\\" is a well-written, well-researched book, which, yes, has a political goal, & no, does not present the whole picture. I refuse to accept that gender-feminists (as Sommers calls them) have black & white ways of thinking, as I also refuse to accept that the same is true for any group of people. I'm sure there are different ways of thinking within the feminist movement, & I'm also sure that there must also be extreme, radical feminists who tend to alienate maistream women: but these radical feminists do not represent today's women's movement, as Sommers seems to imply, nor do they have nearly as much power as she shows them to. The book is interesting but in parts exaggerated, probably to prove a point & to leave no room for doubt. Sadly, this is exactly what the author accuses the gender-feminists of doing, & she falls into the same trap herself.	2002-02-01

All the major developments in aging are contained in the book: historical, basic information on gerontology & geropsychology, lots of \\"life-span approach\\" information, & all that is needed to understand how the (relatively new) field of gerontology came to expand & become a field that is now growing at a quick pace.<br />There's also a lot of up-to-date information, all the new findings & ideas in the field, which help to see how gerontology has started to change the aging process: lots of these changes are described in the book, things like new ways of measuring cognitive skills, the emotional changes in the older population, & the dying process & how to help make it more humane. Needless to say, this textbook contains many \\"aging in process\\" vignettes, which graphically describe real problems & real situations of real people...there are also many figures & graphs, which help the student understand the research & put it in context. All in all, a very helpful textbook.	2002-01-28

This usually means cooking rich, high in calories food, that tastes good because of the use of butter, lots of unrefined sugar, cream, etc. My cookbook shelf contains quite a few books focusing on this type of food, &amp; they surely have a place in every cookbook collection. On the other hand, there have always been books focusing on &quot;light&quot; cooking, containing recipes that tend to use &quot;light&quot; ingredients &amp; many vegetables &amp; fruit. There's always been a need for a book that addresses the gap between these 2 types of cooking, &amp; attempts to bridge this gap. &quot;A new way to cook&quot; is exactly this long-awaited book!<br />Sally Schneider has put taste above everything else: she wants her food to look good &amp; taste good. She also realises, though, that this cannot realistically be achieved through the use of lots of oil or butter or whatever else, since most people have health &amp; weight considerations to take into account. So what she has done is this: she's experimented with lots of different cooking methods, trying to get the best possible taste out of a certain food, using the least possible calories. She does not exclude any ingredients: she just uses everything in moderation &amp; proposes lots of inventive methods. <br />Something that is important is that her book never gets anywhere near boring, &quot;light-cooking&quot; recipes. She has a whole chapter on colorful, indulgent desserts, where you can find everything from lighter desserts using fruits to decadent chocolate cakes &amp; tarts. Schneider's basic premise is that moderation, the use of good ingredients, &amp; inventive, creative cooking methods are the key to good, healthy &amp; yes- in the end, light eating.	2002-01-24

It's probably the easiest &amp; surely one of the most delicious chocolate cakes I've ever tried. I mention this because Regan Daley's book is full of delicious &amp; inventive recipes. Recipes that are, mostly, not that difficult &amp; that taste exceptional. One of the reasons for this is that Daley insists on excellent ingredients, &amp; that surely is one of the basic secrets of good baking. <br />Her book is much more than a wonderful resource for deserts: it's, mainly, a general baking resource, listing ingredients &amp; talking about each one: how to use, what to substitute with what, what to combine with what etc. The book is full to the brim with information &amp; tips, for the beginning &amp; the experienced baker. As a bonus, the writing delighted me, &amp; I think it will probably make all my other desert books redundunt!! (apart from Nigella Lawson's &quot;Domestic Goddess&quot; which I think has a similar style).

US	52531272	R2YRKWLI3FW4K2	0385425074	227839006	Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women	Books	4	54	65	N	N	landmark feminist book	I just received \\"Stiffed\\" (also by Susan Faludi) in the mail today, so before getting started on that, I thought I'd take a look at \\"Backlash\\" again, & remember how it had felt to read it.<br />It's been quite a few years since I first came to \\"Backlash\\", & back then, I remember that it had made a strong impression on me. It turns out that it was a lasting impression, since, reading parts of the book again now, I see that there are points that have stuck with me & formed parts of arguments I myself use sometimes in conversations! The book is not dated, in my opinion, even though it was written in the 80s. Also, the book may be specifically addressing US society, but the basic arguments apply to European countries, as well.<br />The basic premise of the book you probably know, so I'll just briefly say that it has to do with the backlash that has risen against feminism & its achievements. You could state it like this: Feminism takes 1 step forward & then gets forced to take 1 step back. After reading \\"Backlash\\" the first time around, I remember thinking how clear & logical (& true to my experience here in Greece) is Susan Faludi's argument. Lots of people (mostly men, but women too) are threatened by womens' advancements. So they chose the easy way out: they deride feminism, laugh at \\"lesbian / ugly / man-hating\\" etc etc feminists & fail to see that feminism is nothing more than the wish for equality between the sexes: not sameness. But equality.<br />Susan Faludi painstakingly finds evidence that supports her basic argument, & presents loads & loads of research & interviews to prove her point. There are 2 things that I found a little disappointing: one is the harshness of some of her characterizations: I understand what she's trying to do, she's trying to make some of the \\"backlash movers & shakers\\" come alive, with vivid writing & many examples. But sometimes her descriptions are purely cruel, & over the top. People are not one-dimensional as she sometimes shows them to be. Second thing I (kind of) didn't like was the extreme length of the book. It did get tiring at times, & did overdo some of the arguments by repeating & repeating them. But maybe her goal was achieved, since these basic arguments have stayed with me for so many years!!<br />All in all, a landmark book in women studies / feminism, & an interesting book even today, in 2002, quite a few years after its first appearance in bookstores.	2002-01-22

It was translated in Greek, but I'm sure it doesn't lose anything of the original English text in the translation, which was excellent. The play lasted a little more than 3 hours, which in itself was exhausting. So, one first comment is that, while &quot;Saved&quot; is good writing, &amp; the characters come alive...still, why 3 hours? Definitely overlong, in my opinion.<br />&quot;Saved&quot; is basically the story of a family. A father &amp; mother, who hate each other &amp; won't even address each other by name, but still live in the same house. Their daughter, who is a very sick young woman, maybe suffers from bipolar disorder &amp; clearly has severe psychological problems. This woman, Pam, forms a relationship with a young man (Len) who seems kind of a loser, but is kind &amp; caring nontheless. In the beginning, they promise that they'll be different from Pam's parents...but of course, this promise soon, too soon, is forgotten. Still, Len is the only person that stands by Pam, when she's most in need, &amp; even after she falls desperately in love with another man, who couldn't care less about her.<br />The rest of the story I won't reveal. &quot;Saved&quot; is basically the story of extreme unhappiness in one family, a family that choses silence &amp; sometimes loud, violent fights over talking &amp; trying to communicate. They don't know HOW to communicate, all they know is shouting, hating, throwing things &amp; crying. This is a very sad (but powerful) play, very violent at parts, which is the reason for the 3 stars: I can understand &amp; appreciate characters with problems. But there's one scene which has to do with a baby, which broke my heart while I was watching it, &amp; which I can't seem to get over. I know it is a powerful scene, &amp; I know that many people might argue that it's the most meaningful scene in the play. But I just found it too cruel to be meaningful.	2002-01-20

From the very first page of the introduction, Yalom's writing is gripping &amp; right to the point. He mentions turning 70 years old, which has made him feel a need to &quot;pass on&quot; his knowledge &amp; some of his experience to younger generations of therapists &amp; patients. This is what he tries to do in this substantial book, a book of tips, long on technique &amp; short on theory (as Yalom himself says).<br />Each &quot;tip&quot; that Yalom gives comes from years of experience &amp; in most cases, makes perfect sense. Something that should be noted is that his book is not written, I think, for the non-psychologically trained reader. It's aimed towards psychotherapists, &amp; tries to steer them in the direction of good choices &amp; good therapeutic work with clients / patients. Most tips may seem like common sense to most psychologists / psychotherapists, but if you think a little bit more about them, most of them are not used as often as they should be. Also, apart from the more obvious tips, Yalom offers a whole range of extremely innovative (&amp; maybe some times controversial) pieces of advice. These chapters alone are, in my opinion, well worth the price of the book, since they make you sit down &amp; think.<br />All in all, a great reference book for psychotherapists which comes alive through wonderful, clear writing, &amp; lots of lively clinical examples.	2002-01-19

He's almost 30 (oh, that dreaded birthday!), lives in a run-down basement, is divorced, with a young daughter who he seldom sees, works at a menial job &amp; generally struggles to survive. This at least is the description of Barnaby's life, if you look at it from a detached, criticizing point of view. He's the ultimate &quot;loser&quot; in a society that measures people through their wealth, beauty, image. Barnaby comes from a rich family, but is a former juvenile delinquent. He's not particulary handsome &amp; he couldn't care less about his image. Still, in a world that would measure people in different ways, he would be considered a wonderful man: through his work he helps those most in need (elderly clients in the company &quot;Rent-a-back&quot;) &amp; is a kind, thoughtful, gentle man, but hopelessly insecure &amp; maybe misdirected.<br />Along comes Sophia, a school-marmish sort of woman, who, as is mentioned in the book, &quot;each night scrubs her face, brushes her teeth &amp; climbs- alone- into her four-poster-bed&quot;. Barnaby thinks Sophia is his guardian-angel (a tradition in his family) &amp; forms a relationship with her, striving to be as good as she is. What he doesn't realise, until the end, is that Sophia's goodness is only skin-deep, while his own character &amp; potential is more truthful &amp; honest by far.<br />What stays with me after closing the book is first, the whole theme of goodness &amp; the ability to give to others, which is explored beautifully, &amp; second, Anne Tyler's thoughts about old-age &amp; elderly people...very chilling, very true. Those chapters broke my heart but I thought they were true to life.	2002-01-17

The characters that I came to know &amp; like in the first book were all there (Harry, Hagrid, Hermione &amp; Ron), the humour was there, &amp; of course the mystery was there...culminating in an interesting &amp; unexpected ending. If I absolutely HAD to look for a flaw in book number two, the only thing I'd say is that it's not that different from book 1. And therefore it doesn't take you so much by surprise as the first one does. The third book in the series (The prisoner of Azkaban) is, I believe, much better than the first 2 books. But anyway: these are all details: the point is that the Harry Potter books are clear, pure fun &amp; even if one is a little better or a little worse than the other, all in all, the four books (up till now) are all very worth reading.	2001-12-29

I'm not a mother, I'm not even married, so I haven't yet looked into all these issues in depth. I also don't live in the US. So it was interesting to read about the health system there, which seems to be on the one hand very much intervention-oriented but on the other hand, there is a continually growing natural-birth movement, which is very good. <br />I've read all of Naomi Wolf's previous books, &amp; as I can recall, each &amp; every one was met with lots of criticism when they first came out. There are flaws in this book, but it's a 'story' that needs to be told. As many other readers have noted, Wolf is a world-known feminist, &amp; the fact that she decided to tackle this difficult issue may help in more public awareness of the problems of childbirth &amp; pregnancy. One criticism I found extremely unfair is that Naomi &quot;whines&quot;. It's true that the book has a general negative feeling about pregnancy &amp; childbirth: but it's also true that 99,9% of information for mothers-to-be show a glowing, content, totally calm &amp; fullfilling experience. Sure, there's talk about the pain of labour. But apart from that, there's little aknowledgment in society of a)post-partum depression, b) womens' frustration &amp; sense of failure when they don't manage as well as they hoped work &amp; child-rearing &amp; when their husbands are only &quot;helpers&quot; &amp; not equal partners in the new responsibilities. These issues have to be handled by the woman herself, while everyone around her finds it hard to see these difficulties. I've seen this happening in many of my friends' lives, I've seen the disappointment &amp; the difficulties, &amp; it would be so much better, first of all for the children, if mothers were better cared-for by their husbands but also by society as whole. Naomi Wolf proposes some interesting changes &amp; gives some ideas at the end of the book, so that's a start.<br />Another unfair argument is that Naomi Wolf is &quot;privileged&quot;, that she has a sense of entitlement. Also, some readers have asked- &quot;what is she complaining about? she had a healthy baby didn't she&quot;. Since when does the fact that a woman is well-off take away her right &amp; even responsibility to talk about everything she's learnt? Since when does that fact that a woman had a healthy baby mean that she has to forget &amp; erase all she went through before that? It's as if she should be grateful or something, when the fact is that most women do have healthy babies but most women also aren't encouraged to talk about their negative experiences as well as the positive. Women like Wolf have the knowledge, time &amp; yes money to do good research &amp; to shout out loud all this information that has to be heard. So it's not only in her self-interest that she does this, it's in the interest of all women.<br />Even though I liked this book, there are a couple of things I wasn't happy with. First, the fact that some of Wolf's points were not very clear, &amp; they were even contradictory at times. For example her view about abortion confused &amp; angered me. She does not take a clear pro-choice position but rather says she takes this position while on the other hand she finds herself confused &amp; persuaded partly by pro-lifers. Also, she talks about breast-feeding glowingly, &amp; then goes on to put down &quot;La leche league&quot; as &quot;lactation fascists&quot;. <br />A final note: the book is very very badly edited. There's not a complete bibliography in the end, &amp; there are MANY typos. I found myself holding a pen, crossing out wrongly spelled words, or adding missing words. This to me is unacceptable &amp; even a little embarrasing for the editors &amp; indeed, the author.<br />All in all, a book well worth reading, which maybe doesn't contain wide research but which definitely leads a reader to do more research on their own.	2001-12-29

Although in the beginning this novel seemed promising (Sarah's story is very lively &amp; well told) later the book dragged on and on...Jong's central themes (women versus men, spirit versus day to day life) were better explored in her earlier works. <br />It seems as if Erica Jong is, yet again, trying to say the same old things in the same old way. Maybe the &quot;same old things&quot; part isn't what's wrong: the &quot;same old way&quot; part definitely is. She's an intelligent writer, seems like an intelligent &amp; very lively person (especially from Fear of Fifty, even though that too, was repetitive) so why can't she start writing something different? I mean, completely different, not just &quot;changing the names of the main characters&quot; different...	2001-12-29

You live in a small town in Vermont, but you could be living anywhere since your life is just about as mainstream as it can get. You have a good, working relationship with your ex-husband &amp; enjoy your work in the school. You are open-minded &amp; liberal. Then, during one summer, you fall in love with a wonderful man...&amp; it's been a while since you've felt this way. Only it turns out that this man has a little secret which is about to come out in the open: he is really a woman, trapped in a man's body &amp; miserable about it. He is a pre-operation transexual, &amp; is scheduled for surgery in January...<br />This is the situation of &quot;Trans-Sister Radio&quot;, &amp; this is the situation that Allison Banks finds herself falling into. The handling of the transexual issue is done very well, it's an intriguing subject, raises many questions, both emotional &amp; medical questions. A man trapped in a woman's body, who at some point will &quot;come out&quot; is bound to deal with a lot of bigotry &amp; intolerance. So the first thing that rang false for me is that, apart from some general, vague issues in the small-town community, Dana (the transexual in question) really is very very lucky. His family &amp; friends (&amp; even his new lover) understand him / her &amp; quite easily make the necessary adjustments. I believe that in true life it wouldn't be quite so easy, especially when it comes to the family.<br />Apart from this, the actual writing by Bohjalian is disappointing in my opinion. I agree with other readers that the alternating first person viewpoint is confusing, since the 4 people talking don't seem to have a distinct voice each. Also, I'm beginning to get tired with Bohjalian's topics: he has tackled midwives, homeopathic medicine &amp; now transexuals. In trying to find the next risky, brave, exciting topic, it seems to me that Bohjalian isputting his actual writing in the back burner. <br />Finally, I found the ending (which I won't reveal) to be extremely false. All in all, I learnt quite a lot about gender dysphoria through this book, which is a good thing...but I didn't like it much as a novel.	2001-12-26

This seems to be the central question, &amp; this question is being discussed &amp; looked at from all sorts of different angles, the last couple of years.<br />I have a good friend who is an anti-globalization activist. He also happens to be a communist, &amp; has been going to all the big protests: his last one was in Genoa. I, on the other hand, haven't joined him in these protests, so far. It's not that I don't agree with much of what he's saying. It's just that I disagree with many of the means used to achieve the goal. I also disagree with the &quot;them: bad, us: good&quot; mentality. I find it very simplistic. <br />My friend &amp; I have been having long, heated discussions, &amp; we always seem to find common ground on some things...we also always disagree on other things. The important thing is that we always DISCUSS these things &amp; try to see the other's point of view. This is one thing that made me skeptical about Naomi Klein's book. Where is the discussion? Where are the arguments that others use? It's a well known fact that to properly fight an opinion differing from your own, you have to really know a lot about this other opinion. You have to respect it, listen to it, &amp; THEN fight it. <br />There are two ways to argue a point: you either start from a basic axiom which you want to defend, &amp; find everything you can, in order to defend it. This, in my opinion, is a lot like religion: you either believe or you don't. Naomi Klein deeply, passionately believes in anti-globalization: so she gathers all arguments that support her view. These arguments are persuasive, &amp; some of them are definitely fair ones. But I think this way of arguing is wrong, it's deeply flawed. There is another way, which is to take the opposite point of view, present it, &amp; describe, using logic &amp; persuasion, why it's wrong.<br />I also am a little bit sceptical about Naomi Klein's research. I'm notan economist, but there are some points that seem glaringly wrong: for example, inflation &amp; different standards of living are not taken into account, at all. Wages in indonesia are compared to wages in the US, which seems to me a totally distorted way of looking at the issue. Naomi's argument would be far more persuasive if her research was more meticulous. It's a shame really, because what's she's trying to say is basically right: marketing &amp; logos have intruded in every little part of our lives, &amp; it's starting to feel suffocating. Also, the conditions under which people work in sweatshop factories are terrible, &amp; this has been widely documented by various journalists. But I can't help thinking that there are 2 (or more) sides to this story, &amp; that Naomi Klein has failed to present them fairly. This, in the end, makes &quot;No logo&quot; seem like a book saying &quot;I have to convert you because I'm right&quot; and not &quot;I'm right because of this &amp; that argument&quot;. This book seems more like preaching than anything else. It also reminded me of an argument that I've always distrusted: it goes something like this--either you're with us, or you're not. I happen to agree with some of the points that Naomi Klein is making, but I disagree with other points, &amp; I strongly disagree with the research she's used to reach all her arguments. There is not always black or white: there are also shades of gray, &amp; usually most of the truth can be found there.	2001-10-26
US	52531272	R37WP0ZH1EFHVH	0670899844	631117873	Thinks . . .	Books	4	1	4	N	N	Another university-novel from David Lodge	&quot;Basically I'm a coward: I lack the courage of my unbelief&quot;. This phrase, for me, was the gist of this book. &quot;Thinks&quot; is about the ongoing struggle between science &amp; religion. It is presented as a love story between a cognitive scientist, Ralph Messenger, &amp; a novelist, Helen Reed, who is teaching creative writing, for one semester, at the university where Messenger works. The two meet, they start talking, they soon realize that their worldviews differ, but this difference makes their arguments interesting &amp; heated. Their basic topic of discussion is this: is the mind separate from the body, as Descartes famously declared? or is the mind a part of the body, no more, no less, which necessarily ends with the body's death?<br />This argument about the existence (or not) of a soul separate from the body, is at the heart of philosophical discussions, since Descartes put the subject on the table. One could say it still hasn't been solved, although with each step science takes, religion (&amp; dualism) loses ground. It's interesting that in this book Helen Reed doesn't really represent the religious, dualist point of view: she is basically an unbeliever, who (as she says in the quote I mentioned before) doesn't want to totally give in to science &amp; to atheism: she wants to keep a piece of her soul to herself, one could say!<br />David Lodge's books have always been a delight to read, &amp; also a good starting point for different discussions. He is probably the most well-known writer of life on campus, of the &quot;university novel&quot; if I could call it that. This time, the place is the (made up) university of Gloucestershire, in the UK, &amp; specifically, the cognitive science department. As usual, with university life come scandals, infidelities, secrets, but also friendships, love-affairs, &amp; most of all: long-winded, passionate, juicy, heated discussions. Helen Reed &amp; Ralph Messenger are not merely two people who are passionate about each other's body, they are also two people who are passionate about each other's mind. And as lovers of the mind it is that they make their most interesting connection.	2001-10-12

Some of her books I've loved, others I've merely liked. Never was there a book by Susan Isaacs that I've hated or been bored with. Even &quot;Red white &amp; blue&quot;, her weakest work to date, was finished in a matter of hours. <br />&quot;Long time no see&quot; could be called a sequel, if we were to stretch the meaning of the word &quot;sequel&quot;. In it, Judith Singer, housewife &amp; recent widow, is slowly getting bored by single life &amp; work at the local college. 20 years ago, she had helped solve a murder, by getting the detective itch. She gets the urge again, when learning about Courtney Logan's mysterious disappearance. She even, fearlessly, volunteers to help solve the mystery, working together with Courtney's father in law, gangster Phil Lowenstein.<br />Part of the fun of S.Isaac's books is the terrific humour &amp; the one-liners. Most of her heroines (and Judith more so than others) are wittier, more brave versions of everyday women. The actual mystery in this book is solved piece by piece, conversation by conversation, &amp; we watch as, incredibly, Judith gets to the end of it. While she does this, she manages to have a reunion with her flame from long ago, Nelson Sharpe, who we last met in &quot;Compromising Positions&quot;. 20 years may have passed, but (&amp; this is part of Ms.Isaac's talent) it somehow seems natural for Judith &amp; Nelson to get back together. Maybe, in the end, that's why I love Susan Isaacs: she takes everyday people, puts them into not-everyday situtations, and lets things happen.	2001-09-23

So, when I started studying psychology as a second degree, I was kind of anxious about taking all kinds of statistics courses: it seems that statistics are a major part of any psychology degree, &amp; so it was important for me to learn them well, from the beginning.

This is a textbook that guides you, step by step, so you can understand all the basic concepts of statistics, without feeling you're making an effort. Lots of problem-solving &amp; learning checks help, lots of revision at the end of each chapter...the book is organized in an excellent &amp; thoughtful way, perfect for a student who will take the time sto study (it covers almost everything) but who wants to do it in an organized way.	2001-08-27

But then again, I knew this when I went &amp; bought &quot;Good in bed&quot; (catchy title, by the way!) so there's no reason to complain. So was &quot;Good in bed&quot; original? Not really. Was it good? Yes, I think so. That's where I was pleasantly surprised...<br />Jennifer Weiner is a journalist for the Philadelphia Inquirer. Actually, she's a columnist, holding a space in the Sunday paper for the last couple of years, writing mainly about books &amp; writers, but just about anything else, too. Her writing style is very good--funny, to-the-point, meaningful. Now she's written a book that manages to transcend the &quot;single girl feels lonely, has dozens of problems, is overweight &amp; depressed but still manages to meet Mr. Right&quot; genre...How does she do this? How is this book original when the plotline is nothing but? Well, it's simple. As for all kinds of books, this kind of book begins &amp; ends with the author's talent &amp; ability to write. <br />The actual story of &quot;Good in bed&quot; is sometimes over the top, I admit. Sometimes the coincidences in Cannie's life are too strange to swallow. Some other times her life seems a little like a soap opera, while others it just seems like she's making trouble for herself. But still, while I was reading this novel, none of these thoughts came to me, nothing really struck me as unreal or phony: I was merely having lots of fun.<br />Sorry about not writing anything about the actual plot! You've probably guessed most of it, anyway. And you're most probably right! Girl meets boy. Girl loses boy. Girl finds other boy. Do they live happily ever after? Does she manage to lose the weight she's been struggling with? Does her disfunctional family shape up? Well, it's all for you to find out. And in the meantime, have fun while reading this.	2001-08-20

It's always better to have a &quot;basic&quot; recipe for, say, muffins or brownies or whatever...&amp; then to work from there, adding ingredients &amp; finding interesting variations. Following a recipe from a book that I don't trust never produces the results I want, &amp; leaves me disappointed. That's why I turn to this book, or &quot;How to eat&quot; by Nigella Lawson (&amp; some others) just to be sure I'm doing it right...What I do is---I start off with one of these recipes, &amp; then adjust some of the ingredients to have the result of a different recipe that I'm following. I've found this method works well for me.<br />All the recipes I've tried so far from &quot;The perfect recipe&quot; work fine. The muffins &amp; brownies are wonderful, much better than most other recipes I'd tried before. The actual reading of the book is very good too. I tend to prefer cookbooks that almost read like...fiction!! What I mean is, I prefer to know how &amp; why the author cooked this, or the story behind the meal, or the memories the food brings, or whatever: I hate it when cookbooks just give a &quot;dry&quot; recipe, not explaining anything, just telling you to follow instructions. In this respect &quot;the perfect recipe&quot; is almost...perfect.<br />My only complaint is first, the total lack of photos, &amp; secondly the fact that most recipes in the book are high fat. Apart from that, I recommend this to any person who loves cooking &amp; also loves reading about cooking.	2001-08-19

The story of Marianne & her abandonment by her parents was one of the saddest & most frustrating stories I've ever read. It made me  angry & sad, & I'm not sure with who I'm angry: the fictional characters, Corinne & Mike Mulvaney, or merely Joyce Carol Oates for setting this whole story up & then leaving so many lose ends, so many things unexplained.<br />I can't really decide whether I loved or hated \\"We were the Mulvaneys\\". I read it in one sitting, after a slow start (the book takes a while to \\"get rolling\\" but once it draws you in, it's a quick & easy read). The storyline is simple--a (supposedly) happy american family, with 4 kids, starts disintegrating & finally falls apart after the only daughter gets raped. .... For many people who read the book, this decision, to send Marianne away, was hard to swallow, & ruined the whole story for them. For me, this was just the  point of the book, the heart of the story, the heart of the dysfunction of this family. Other things troubled me though, mainly that the book could have taken off from that point on, but didn't.<br />One thing I liked is that Joyce Carol Oates describes the characters beautifully. Particularly the character of Marianne comes to life. As I said, she broke my heart completely, even though her character was not very close to reality. Patrick was the one of the 3 brothers that I found the most interesting, a tough, introverted intellectual who gets torn apart between his devotion to science & his yearning for spirit & meaning to life. This issue is treated intelligently in the book, although I didn't feel it was resolved in the end. But then again, the science vs. religion issue can never be totally resolved, just discussed. The 2 other brothers were more like caricatures & I fail to understand why the story was supposedly told through the eyes of the youngest brother. It didn't seem like he was talking half of the time, & anyway--his character never really came to life.<br/>For me, the most important & meaningful theme of the book was the issue of the \\"image\\"  that a family can often strive to achieve & show others. Not only show other people, but also show the family members, making the point, again & again, of the perfection & absolute happiness that the family has achieved. Living for & through this image (this fake image, because in truth, perfection is never possible) can be hard & sometimes can alienate people from each other. Acceptance of people (& family members) as they really are is harder work, but much more meaningful, & it's were the Mulvaneys failed miserably.<br />One major complaint for me was the happy ending. At some point in the book, it felt like Oates was trying to \\"hurry up & tie up some lose ends\\". These lose ends though failed to get tied up, & the ending seemed just unreal & improbable. It ruined the impression the book left me with, although I still enjoyed the journey.	2001-08-19

I think that if I'd read &quot;Getting over it&quot; before &quot;Running with heels&quot;, in the order they were written, I would probably like Maxted's second novel even less. &quot;Getting over it&quot; is a very easy-to-read book, funny at times, quite emotional at others. Anna Maxted seems to have a tendency to &quot;mix&quot; the basic &amp; essential romance  in her books with real-life issues, such as death, abuse, anorexia, depression etc. She does this quite well, actually, &amp; always stays within her genre, meaning that she never loses her humour &amp; her light touch.<br />As for the plot of the book, I won't go into details, but basically it's about a 20something woman, living in London (of course) who suddenly loses her father, &amp; who gets over it, slowly &amp; painfully, over a year. The plot is not so important though, the writing is: &amp; Anna Maxted is a good writer, probably one of the best Bridget-Jones-type writers (I couldn't finish my review without mentioning the B word just once!!)	2001-08-04

On the one hand, I finished it quickly. But then again, this is what usually happens with all these romantic-comedy books. On the other hand, I didn't really like Natalie, &amp; how can you give a high rating to a book where you dislike the main character?<br />Anna Maxted has created a woman who seems to have all sorts of different problems. This of course is not a bad thing, it's good to have such a reality-based protagonist in a book. But when an author chooses this approach, they should probably find reality-based solutions to these problems, too. And I think that's where &quot;Running in heels&quot; fails: Natalie's problems (basically her eating disorder) just seem to fade away with no effort whatsoever. <br />It should also be noted that Natalie's anorexia &amp; bulimia seem to have escalated out of control, since she's losing her hair &amp; practically eating nothing. It's not as if she just started not eating...it seems like she's been at it for a while now. That's why it's totally unrealistic when she just &quot;gets over it&quot; with no counselling, &amp; basically no help from her friends, apart from a couple of &quot;introductory&quot; discussions.<br />All in all, &quot;Running in heels&quot; is saved only by Anna Maxted's talent. She is a gifted writer, &amp; her characters come to life. I'll definitely buy her next book, but still--this one didn't manage to get its point across, at least as I see it. The author probably had something else in mind--a girl with low self esteem, with all sorts of problems, who learns how to solve them, how to help herself &amp; in the end how to love others. What this book is about, instead, is a very very weak &amp; not so nice character, who can't speak up for herself, &amp; who in the end magically just changes.	2001-07-28
US	52531272	R1D2CKVV31RAGG	1573221937	319964836	How To Be Good	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Strange book	I really, really wanted to love this book. Nick Hornby has been one of my favourite writers for the past years, as I'm sure is true for many many people. &quot;High Fidelity&quot; &amp; &quot;About a boy&quot; were both hilarious &amp; also very true to life. &quot;How to be good&quot;, on the other hand, is none of the two: Not funny, &amp; not true to life.<br />It's true that the whole theme of the new-agey-guru DJ GoodNews coming to live in a middle-class family home could be funny. His bossiness, his irritating righteousness, his &quot;I'm right &amp; I'll tell you how to live your life since my way is the only way&quot;, his way of taking up space (&amp; I don't mean it only literally) &amp; feeling he's entitled to it...All this could be a great parable of the new-age, &quot;I'm ok-you're ok&quot;, eastern religious craziness that has become common ground for so many people nowadays. From page to page I expected Nick Horby to take a stand about all this, to become angry at DJ GoodNews &amp; his rudeness (because, apart from anything else, GoodNews is rude &amp; presumptious as hell)...But Nick Hornby never really takes a clear position. It's as if he hasn't really decided what it is he wants to say in this book. Does DJ GoodNews have a point? Is his way an option? This is never answered clearly. And what about Katie Carr? Why doesn't she get angrier? Why doesn't she ever confront her husband about everything that's been going on? His loss of a sense of humour, for one, which for many many people I know would be so terrible to have to stomach.<br />One good thing I can say about the book is that it's a quick, easy read. Maybe, apart from anything else, because it constantly seems to be making a vague promise for something meaningful coming up. And you wait &amp; wait &amp; wait &amp; nothing does come up. All in all, &quot;How to be good&quot; is an unrealistic book, &amp; apart from that it fails, in my opinion, to make a clear point in the end. Not making aclear point could be acceptable if we were talking about a normal, realistic, day-to-day situation. But creating a whole story where everything is so unreal &amp; unlikely, &amp; then failing to explain to the reader what has been going on...this, to me, was the real problem with the book. It fails to deliver on what's it's been promising since page one.	2001-07-25

Neither of course was anything very special, but still, if it's a light read you're looking for...they were ok. This third book (I think it was the first one S. Lewis wrote, but I may be mistaken) wasn't as good as the other two, in my opinion...<br />It's the story of a 30 something, single woman, who's had an on &amp; off relationship with a totally unreliable man for years, &amp; who suddenly finds herself pregnant. To top all this, Alice has problems with her work that doesn't seem to be going anywhere. The book takes off from there, &amp; tells us the story of this woman, &amp; more  specifically of her decision to have the baby, no matter what. There's also a parallel story of Alice's relationship with her old grandmother...<br />Could be a fun &amp; easy read, except that the writing failed to &quot;pull me in&quot;. The other 2 Sara Lewis books that's I'd read were also everyday stories of everyday women, who tended to be in a kind of crossroads in their lives. The same &quot;formula&quot; applies here, but it doesn't seem to work as well, the characters don't seem to come to life. If &quot;Heart conditions&quot; is indeed the author's debut novel, then that explains it. She got better with time.	2001-07-23
US	52531272	R1BYPL4H6OJAHH	0767905199	527463952	Mr. Maybe	Books	4	1	3	N	N	very good romantic comedy	OK, OK, I admit it...I really enjoyed this book! I believe in the small, guilty, self-indulgent pleasures in life: and this kind of book is exactly what the doctor prescribed! Of course, one rule-of-thumb about these books is not to compare them to other types of books. If you do, it's just like comparing an Ingmar Bergman or a Fellini movie to the latest action movie. There's just no comparison. So I give &quot;Mr.Maybe&quot; 4 stars, having compared to to other romantic-comedy-type books.<br />&quot;Mr. Maybe&quot; is actually a very good example of this Bridget-Jones genre (yes, the &quot;Bridget-Jones&quot; tag seems to have stuck permanently to these books). Libby is a twenty-something single woman living in London. This probably applies to 99,999% of the heroines in these books. What puts the book in the &quot;good&quot; category is the fact that the romance seems to work well. Romantic comedies have to be a) romantic &amp; b) funny, at least at times. As for a)--Libby &amp; Nick's romance works well. And as for b)--well...I guess the relationship between Libby &amp; Ed has to be one of the stupidest &amp; most pointless romances (if you could even call it that) that I've read about recently, so...that would make it funny!<br />Anyway, to make a long story short: Read &quot;Mr.Maybe&quot; without being cynical or critical. Read it at the beach. Read it on a long flight home. Read it anytime you feel you need something light to lift your spirit.	2001-07-01
US	52531272	R1A5M6LS4T4APV	037570910X	292207917	The Feast of Love: A Novel	Books	5	26	26	N	N	comfort reading at its best	There's such a thing as comfort-eating. Food you turn to when feeling sad or lonely. Food that is familiar &amp; yet delicious, &amp; can help get your spirits up each time you turn to it. Well, I believe there is also such a thing as comfort reading. &quot;The feast of love&quot; is one of the best novels that I read last year. After reading it for the first time, I've found myself returning to it again &amp; again, turning to favourite pieces, or simply reading it from cover to cover, on long, rainy, lonely weekends. It's the kind of novel that makes you step out of your everyday-world, forget all that's on your mind, &amp; live through the characters inhabiting the book.<br />I've been a fan of Charles Baxter for ages, he's definitely one of the best american short-story writers, &amp; my personal second favourite, after Lorrie Moore. &quot;The feast of love&quot; came as a surprise, because it's different from other works by Baxter. It's a novel, but it's also a collection of stories, so in this way Charles Baxter doesn't move far from his usual style of writing. One of the surprises is the fact that the author appears as a character in the book. This &quot;trick&quot; could work or could not, &amp; then would be considered just a party-trick &amp; thus, tacky. Here, it works. <br />&quot;Charlie&quot; (aka Charles Baxter) is a blocked writer who suffers from insomnia &amp; wonders the streets of Ann Arbour, Michigan during long nights, looking for ideas but finding none. On one of his nightly walks he meets his neighbour Bradley, who's walking his dog, also named Bradley. &quot;Why not name your new novel Feast of love&quot;? Bradley suggests. I could tell you stories about myself &amp; people around me, &amp; you could talk to some of them yourself. This is the basic idea of the book, &amp; the stories start unfolding, one more enchanting than the next. <br />This book vaguely reminded me of &quot;things we talk about when we talk about love&quot; by Raymond Carver, &amp; also other books by R.Carver. It's one of the best collections of love stories I've ever read, &amp; for me getting such a strong emotional response from a book is reason enough to love it. There's no point in getting into details about the actual love stories. Just read this book, read it when you're in the right frame of mind, enjoy it &amp; pass it on to a friend.	2001-06-26

I find myself turning &amp; returning to these books from time to time, when I'm feeling strange / down / lonely, because I feel as if I'm reading what an acquaintance or a far-away friend has written. This though doesn't mean that I appreciate all of her books the same, &amp; it also doesn't mean that I think Erica Jong is an excellent writer. I just feel comfortable with her writing for some reason, although god knows why..<br />About &quot;Fear of fifty&quot;: It seems to me that Erica Jong has written the same story, again &amp; again. And again. And again, until frankly anyone, even the most well-intentioned person would get tired of it all. I was certainly enthusiastic about her writing at first. But what I think has happened is this-- beginning with &quot;Fear of flying&quot;, &amp; in all the books after that, what she has written really is her life story. As I said- really good &amp; original to read the first time around (that's why &quot;Fear of flying&quot; is still Jong's best-selling book) but tedious after a while. <br />The heroine of &quot;Fear of flying&quot; seems to be in no way  different from the woman shown in &quot;Fear of fifty&quot;, &amp; I have no idea why Erica Jong thought she had to write an autobiography. In &quot;Fear of fifty&quot; she just re-wrote the same things she'd already written in other books. I'm sure I'm no exception when I say that I was already familiar with all the themes in the book, &amp; I knew what was coming, all the way through. This is the reason that I found &quot;Fear of fifty&quot; unoriginal &amp; repetitive, although I must say that there was some comfort to be had in returning to these familiar themes. My point is--Erica Jong's ideas are interesting &amp; her writing is (sometimes) inspired. But reading her books has been like eating the same food again &amp; again: the first time around it was tasty. After a while, it gotboring.	2001-06-25

I should probably not use the word &quot;fight&quot; though--one of the basic things that the author stresses in this book is that dealing with cancer is not a fight in any way: it's living with the circumstances that you're dealt with, &amp; since you really have no choice, you can't be considered a brave person. Still, after finishing this book, I would have to (partly) disagree with J.Diamond. Humour can be a great weapon &amp; also a very brave behaviour. And John Diamond never lost his sense of humour, up until the very end. At least that's what I felt while I was reading the book: that I was listening to a brilliant, down-to-earth, realistic &amp; yet hopeful person talk about his experience. How cancer affected him, his everyday life, his thoughts, his feelings, &amp; how it affected his family life, too.<br />John Diamond, in this book, does fight but in a different way: he fights alternative medicine that doesn't have a basis in scientific research. He uses lots of well thought out arguments &amp; makes a case in favour of orthodox medicine &amp; the treatments it offers. John Diamond also gives new meaning to the phrase &quot;living life from day to day&quot;, not in any new-agey kind of way, but just through the belief that life has a lot to give even when this disease is taking away so much. <br />&quot;Because cowards get cancer too&quot; has been a very interesting read for me. An intelligent, informative, full of details book about living with cancer. But also a funny (sometimes out-loud funny) read that's sure to help &amp; even guide lots of people in their own struggle with disease. In this way, even though it's surely not enough for the late author himself &amp; for his family, John Diamond lives on through this book.	2001-06-11
US	52531272	R3VW0A0KJSCGKS	0312967004	828594561	Eleven Hours	Books	2	12	15	N	N	Very disappointing third book	A pregnant woman (actually, a VERY pregnant woman, just a couple of weeks away from giving birth). A psycho kidnapper. A frantic husband. A black, competent &amp; cool cop. Helicopters. Stolen cars. A climactic scene in the end (I won't specifically mention what happens but it's easy to guess from about page one).<br />Remind you of anything? Yes, you guessed it. &quot;Eleven hours&quot; reads exactly like a screenplay, &amp; a very predictable &amp; boring one, too. I'm not saying it's not a suspenseful, quick read. It is, if you happen to be one of those people that haven't seen this kind of thriller in the movies (a thousand times, too) &amp; thus if you're likely to be surprised by any of it. I wonder what Paullina Simons was thinking. I remember reading somewhere that this book was written quickly. Well, I'm not surprised: if it was indeed written quickly, it's equally quickly read &amp; even more quickly forgotten. She probably was hoping &quot;Eleven Hours&quot; might be turned into a movie, &amp; I wonder if it has or if it will...<br />If I sound bitter, it's simply because &quot;Tully&quot; has been one of my favourite books for many years, I've read it &amp; reread it &amp; always felt it is an extremely well written &amp; very emotional book, with strong characters. I also quite liked &quot;Red Leaves&quot;. So this third book was a big disappointment from an author I've grown to like &amp; admire. Comparing &quot;Tully&quot; to &quot;Eleven hours&quot; is like comparing a good, elaborate, lovingly made home-cooked meal to a quick, greasy, unhealthy hamburger. Both serve their own purpose I guess, but there really is no comparison.	2001-06-11

For some reason, &quot;How to eat&quot; by Nigella Lawson, has been lying around the floor in my bedroom, or on the sofa in the living room, or wherever else apart from the kitchen, for the last couple of years since I bought it. What I'm trying to say is that this book is not just a simple cookbook, but more a description of the pleasure of good eating, &amp; of preparing good food for yourself &amp; for people you love.<br />On the other hand, the actual recipes (at least the ones I've tried so far, which are quite a few) seem to work, even from the first time you try them. I mention this because I've heard &amp; read all sorts of comments about whether N.Lawson's recipes work or not. Maybe this is because Nigella Lawson has become a celebrity in England--imagine: she writes well, cooks well, &amp; to top all that, she's beautiful too! How can you beat that? This is why 2 camps seem to have emerged--a &quot;pro-Nigella&quot; camp &amp; an &quot;anti-Nigella&quot; camp!! This is all ridiculous, of course. The point is that Nigella Lawson has written, at least in my opinion, one of the best cookbooks of recent years. Down to earth, with good &amp; long-winded explanations, written in a direct, friendly style, with such love for good food that even reading the book makes you want to rush to the kitchen &amp; start creating a feast. &quot;How to eat&quot; is about comfort-eating at its best, &amp; for me at least, it serves as comfort-reading too...	2001-06-09
US	52531272	RQ9C5VPDA22UF	0805066128	953287032	Before I Say Goodbye: Recollections and Observations from One Woman's Final Year	Books	3	14	16	N	N	Very sad book	First of all, I don't understand why so many people believe books should be &quot;life changing&quot;. I'm saying this because, when reading the previous reviews about this book, quite a few people have mentioned that they expected this book to be life changing: and it wasn't. Why do all things written by cancer patients &amp; such have to be life changing? That's one question. And why do the things they say have to be relevant to everyone? That's another question.<br />Ruth Picardie was a person with her ups &amp; downs, her good qualities &amp; her bad qualities. One thing that should be immediately noted is that she never intended for a book to be made out of her emailing with friends. Or maybe she thought she had more time, which would enable her to continue writing her columns &amp; make a book out of them eventually. Sadly, her illness caught up with her. So &quot;Before I say goodbye&quot; is just a collection of personal emails, letters from Observer readers, &amp; her 4-5 columns for the Observer. The columns are definitely the best writing in the book, &amp; that's how it should be, since it's the only writing intended for publication.<br />For some reason, I was more touched by the emailing, maybe because the ordinarity of the messages showed me (as if I didn't know...) that commonplace things happen to people with cancer, even as they do to you &amp; me. If you turn that around, it also means that cancer happens to commonplace people, again like you &amp; me!! Obviouus, isn't it? But denial is a very strong force, &amp; it's so natural to believe things like this cannot happen to you. If for nothing else, then just for this, &quot;Before I say goodbye&quot; is very chilling &amp; terrifying. I for one read it in one sitting, yesterday night, &amp; ended up finding it difficult to sleep afterwards...But on the other hand, this book also gave me a sense of perspective about my life &amp; its problems.<br />Another thing I should mention is that there's aninteresting afterword by Ruth Picardie's husband, which gives a much fuller picture about the family &amp; the way they all dealt with Ruth's condition. During the course of the book, lots of questions are left unanswered, which is natural since the book, as I said, is not really a book, but a collection of different pieces of writing. So Matt's writing puts everything into place. It's also a truthful &amp; painful piece of writing.<br />If you're generally interested in this subject-matter, John Diamond's &quot;C: Because cowards get cancer too&quot; is on the top of the list, &amp; also &quot;Dancing at the edge of life&quot; by Gale Warner. These are much more complete books. It's very sad that Ruth's writing never had the chance of developing into a real book. Time was cruelly stolen from her &amp; from her family.	2001-05-17

The people the book is mainly about, Ron Shorenstein, a very cynical &amp; funny guy, &amp; his hippie girlfriend, Karen, have to be older &amp; better looking than the people in this hideous photo!!<br />Apart from the photo: this is a funny, sometimes very funny, &amp; witty book about the world of campus politics &amp; political correctness. Ron is very much critical of his girlfriend's altruistic &quot;hippiness&quot; &amp; of her general lifestyle, her friends, the causes she works for etc. But on the other hand he's &quot;in lust&quot; with her...&amp; slowly he falls in love with her (there's a difference!). In the end, Ron finds himself involved in Karen's political crowd, who are protesting the beginning of construction on an environmentally sensitive spot. <br />The book is kind of a love story, &amp; kind of a story about neo-hippies, &amp; kind of a story about a generation-x (or y or whatever) living in California...But all these issues, in my opinion, weren't developed that well. What really struck me was Asher Brauner's humour, through the voice of Ron Shorenstein. The lack of character development, the lack of good dialogue, the lack of anything resembling pace &amp; structure...all these faults were counterbalanced by lots of laughing-out-loud bits which show that Asher Brauner does have talent. I'm looking forward to his next book, if nothing else, because I had fun during the 2 nights I was reading this one.	2001-05-12
US	52531272	R27FSWZ2LJLV2Y	0743412028	925429454	Pay It Forward	Books	2	1	5	N	N	I can't recommend it...even though I kind of enjoyed it...	The first thing I should say is that I started reading this book, while waiting at the airport to catch a flight home, &amp; finished it 4 hours later, about 10 minutes before landing. My point here is that &quot;Pay it forward&quot; is an easy-to-read, quite compelling book. It takes hold of you, &amp; keeps your attention until you finish it.<br />But I don't think the fact that a book is easily read is what makes it a good book. It may well be that the book is simply shallow. And I think this is exactly the case here. &quot;Pay it forward&quot; has an interesting idea as a central theme (what would happen if someone did a good deed, &amp; instead of accepting any kind of repayment, asked whomever they did the good deed for to &quot;pay it forward&quot; to 3 people). Simple huh? In this incredibly obvious &amp; yet (supposedly) overlooked way, the world would quickly &amp; easily change. World peace, here we come......<br />And yet, the next obvious thought is: so why hasn't this brilliant idea been put into action so far? And here I was impressed by the naivite of many readers &amp; reviewers who think the only reason that this kind of thing doesn't happen has to do with everybody else (except them) being cynics &amp; not believing it could happen. So ok, next obvious question--why would all these supposedly cynical &amp; bitter-hearted people believe world peace could not be achieved that easily? Here the answer is far more complicated. One thing I could say is that doing good for someone else is not a simple thing at all, it has to do with whatever one believes or doesn't believe. Imagine for example a deeply religious person believing they could help people by converting them to &quot;truth&quot;. Imagine also a group of socialists believing communism is the way to help &amp; save people, &amp; taking it into their hands to change the world. That would surely not sit too well with americans, would it? Everyone has a different idea of what's &quot;good&quot; for others...<br />Anyway, to the point--&quot;Pay it forward&quot; is a shallow, well-intentioned little book, a book that can inspire interesting conversations, mostly because of its basic idea. As for development of characters, &amp; the actual writing, I thought that -at best- it was mediocre.	2001-04-18

When I got home &amp; finished the book in 10 minutes (I'm not kidding), I realised how much money I had spent &amp; thought it was such a waste.<br />As many other readers, I was led to buy this book because of Anna Quindlen's name. I enjoy her columns, read them through the internet regurarly, &amp; I have quite liked her novels, too. That is why I cannot understand what led her to write the content for a greeting card (because that's what this is) &amp; sell it as a book. <br />Nothing you'll read in this booklet is original. Nothing is &quot;life changing&quot; as many reviewers have incredibly said. Nothing is stuff you haven't heard before, many many times that is. On talk shows, during conversations with friends, or simply through common sense. Not that what Quindlen writes is untrue. On the contrary. It's just that I suspect there's so much more she could have said, to justify the title &quot;a short guide to a happy life&quot;. In the end, Anna Quindlen is a good &amp; intelligent writer, &amp; it's a shame she sold herself short by publishing this. Many readers, like me, bought this book expecting much much more from her. And it's kind of sad when writers you admire disappoint you. <br />A small note: I quickly looked through the comments other readers made, here on amazon. I was amazed by somebody who wrote that this book is &quot;a fix of optimism &amp; positivity&quot;. As if we're talking about alcohol or coffee. Books &amp; ideas are not &quot;fixes&quot; of anything. But then, how stupid of me to be amazed. I guess there are millions of people out there who turn to self help books to help them change, to help them think &amp; understand what is going wrong with their lives. If you want my advice (which surprisingly coincides with Quindlen's!), forget this type of book, &amp; get a life!	2001-04-01

Photographs, charts, case-studies have all been extremely helpful, & make this textbook accessible & pleasant to read for all psychology students. Possibly one of the best books to intoduce you to the fascinating subject of abnormal psychology.<br /><br />The only small complaint I have is that there's probably a slight bias towards cognitive explanations for the disorders, & a lot less about psychodynamic explanations.. I would be interested to read an abnormal psychology textbook, written from a psychodynamic point of view. Other than that, \\"Abnormal Psychology\\" by David Holmes is a great textbook.	2001-04-01
US	52531272	R2AX5MYI0SNE3	0767905172	310021894	Jemima J: A Novel	Books	3	11	15	N	N	predictable romantic-comedy-type book	I always find it amusing, how so many people complain about novels &amp; movies having happy, hollywood-type endings.Haven't all these people heard the saying-- &quot;beware what you wish for&quot;? Well, just for one moment, imagine a light, romantic-comedy-type book / movie with an UNHAPPY ending. It would feel like you don't get what you payed for, wouldn't it? So I disagree with everyone complaining about &quot;Jemima J&quot; having a clear-cut, predictable ending. What did you expect for god's sake? her ending up overweight again (as would almost certainly happen in real life, considering the huge amount of weight she lost in only 3 months)--overweight, alone &amp; without &quot;the man&quot;? Well, that simply would never happen in this type of novel, &amp; that's what we buy into when we buy these books. <br />Apart from the big &quot;happy ending&quot; issue who everyone seems to be whining about these days...&quot;Jemima J&quot; was almost all I expected it to be. A lighthearted, totally unreal yet addictive &amp; fun to read book. I agree though with most of the previous reviewers who pointed out that the weight issue was not treated as well as it could have been. Ok, being unrealistic is normal in a novel such as  this...but this much? Going to LA to meet someone you met over the internet, &amp; him being as perfect as a magazine photo? Please! Losing so much weight &amp; feeling completely energetic &amp; not looking pale &amp; sick because of the extreme diet? Please again!! Recovering from the (almost certainly existing) eating disorder instantaneously? Come on...As for getting the man of her dreams when thin, I guess that fits into the happy ending thing I mentioned before: it was part of the things I expected. <br />On the other hand, it IS true (although many other readers seem to disagree) that how we look is quite important, if only because it is a reflection of our state of mind &amp; of course of our health. I'm not saying that being extremely thin is the only way to look good, but being extremely overweight certainly doesn't help, either health-wise or in the way we look. And anyway...this book was not an eating disorder psychology book, but a simple novel, with a simple story &amp; a simple ending to the story in the end. What I mean is that I found it unbelievable that some readers found this book &quot;offensive&quot; to all women etc...sure, it was unrealistic &amp; over-the-top. But it's also unrealistic to deny the fact that being seriously overweight involves some health isses, which shouldn't be overlooked...<br />All in all, the book was predictable &amp; kind of fun to read, but &quot;Mr Maybe&quot; (for example) by the same author is much better. And as for all the angry reviews...well, what did you expect when buying &quot;Jemima J&quot;? A treatise on eating disorders? It's just a fun to read book, made for the beach....	2001-01-13
US	52531272	R2QBYRKNIWX8K4	0671880187	536943079	Kitchen	Books	5	9	10	N	N	a little gem of a book	The first thing I thought about this book was that it reminded me of Kazuo Ishiguro's work. Not because he's also a japanese writer, but because their style is extremely similar. Does it have to do with japanese literary style? I'd love to learn more about authors like Ishiguro &amp; Yoshimoto...Right now, all I know is that I've discovered (although a little late! ... since &quot;Kitchen&quot;, Yoshimoto's first work, was published quite a few years ago...)one more favourite author.<br />&quot;Kitchen&quot;, as you've read in most of the other reviews, has 2 parts. Some reviewers thought that &quot;Moonlight shadow&quot; (second part) didn't have a place in the book, at least not as much as the first part. The thing is, &quot;Moonlight shadow&quot; is so mesmerizing that if it had been put first in the book, readers would probably be wanting it to last more, &amp; &quot;Kitchen&quot; to be excluded! What I'm trying to say is that both parts of the book are equally good, &amp; both share the same main subject: that subject is loss.<br />Food and, for that matter, the kitchen, are offered as a means for consolation. The young heroine in the first part  of the book only can fall asleep, after her grandmother dies, while lying next to the refrigerator, listening to its humming which comforts her. Food, friends (as the woman in &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;), heartfelt conversations, music...all these can help. But if after finishing Banana Yoshimoto's book you still feel there's no immediate &amp; clean-cut solution to the problems presented in the book...well, that to me is what makes &quot;Kitchen&quot; a brilliant piece of literature, &amp; very much true to life. Because there are no &quot;endings&quot;, no clean endings in life, it's all continuous, going from good to bad, to mediocre &amp; back again...it's what we make of this process, how we move in time, that matters. And of course...how we learn (or maybe ultimately, never learn) to deal with loss. <br />Afterclosing the book, a funny thing happened: the wonderful but melancholic music of Mike Oldfield's &quot;Moonlight shadow&quot; kept coming to mind. I was amazed to find that that was what inspired Yoshimoto's short story...	2001-01-13

Even calling it a &quot;generation X, Y&quot; or whatever book, would be simplistic. The truth of the matter is that this book is just very very different from anything else, has its own, completely unique style &amp; should be read as such. <br />Now, is it good or bad that this book is written so differently? In my opinion, it's very good, very refreshing: reading this, you feel as if you're actually taking walks in Dave Egger's mind. It's as if he puts down on paper not only what's on his mind but also how he gets from one point to another, how he jumps from one topic to another: he doesn't just SAY things. He DESCRIBES why &amp; how he got to be thinking of these things...<br />The story is straightforward enough, but it serves mostly as the background for the writer &amp; his style. Two parents die, right in the beginning of the book, both from cancer. They leave behind 4 kids. Dave kind of takes unofficial custody of the youngest boy, &amp; the 2 of them live together. End of part one. Part two has to do with a magazine that Dave &amp; his buddies publish. Part three is...well, pure Dave I could say! Thoughts, feelings &amp; less action. Sound boring? Not at all. Once you get into this book (&amp; especially when you reach part three, which to me is some of the most beautiful &amp; honest writing I've read in a while)you won't be able to put it down. Yes, I know they say that with all the books! But in this case, take my word for it, you really won't be able to put it down. If not for anything else, because you'll feel like you're being rude to somebody who's in the middle of explaining something to you. When does he finish the explaining? Well...by the end of the book.<br />A lot has been said about the &quot;cute&quot; way the book begins --I mean, even the notes about the publisher etc have notes &amp; comments around them...also, there is an enormous preface which can be seen as original, in that it talks directly to the reader, giving him guidelines for enjoyment of the book. To me, no guidelines are needed in this case. And however &quot;cute&quot; the preface were...if the actual book wasn't any good, it would just be another effort for originality, a failed effort that is. But in this case, reading the book means you've discovered a very talented &amp; intelligent new writer. And for me it meant waiting eagerly for his next book. So come on Dave, when's it going to be?	2000-12-15
US	52531272	R3G3GO3RXXBUIA	0684853523	44310359	On Writing:  A Memoir of the Craft	Books	3	19	25	N	N	book about writing by Stephen King	I've been reading Stephen King's books for years...as, I guess has almost everyone else! So I couldn't pass up this book, with the intriguing title &quot;on writing&quot;: a chance to take a peak into the mind of the writer whose books I've followed for so long! A chance --maybe!-- to get an answer to the question: where the hell does he get all his ideas? <br />Of course, after finishing the book, I still don't know where he gets his ideas, or why...I don't get equally interesting ideas! The fact remains: talent has a lot to do with it, &amp; many people have tried to explain talent, to translate it into other things, like hard work, having read a lot or whatever. Talent remains a great mystery, &amp; if you've got it, you've got it. If not...well, however many books about writing you read, tough: you won't be able to get this gift, this mysterious ability that is talent.<br />On the other hand, one thing I found very interesting in Stephen King's book, is that there exists an equation, sort of. Here's how it goes: people who write badly will never be able to write well. People who write well will never be able to write beautifully. BUT (&amp; that's a big but!)people who are competent in writing, who can write fairly well, will probably be able to learn how to write well, with a lot of hard work. And of course if they develop a style, follow some rules, not fall into traps, whatever. Stephen King gives some pointers, some ideas &amp; rules about writing in this book, which seemed mostly sensible to me. Although some of them seemed a little obvious, &amp; those were the parts of the book I didn't enjoy so much.<br />But what I found most interesting about &quot;On writing&quot; were the autobiographical parts, the parts that show us how King started writing, a little about his family life, a little about his character &amp; his weaknesses &amp; strengths...this all explained a lot to me about the writer of books I've loved such as &quot;Four past midnight&quot; or&quot;The dead Zone&quot; or &quot;Misery&quot;. Especially &quot;Misery&quot;...he tells us quite a lot about the writing process of that one, &amp; it's all very interesting. In the end, I felt very sad reading about Stephen King's accident, &amp; also --once again-- I felt amazed by the way he can take us right to the exact location of whatever he's describing...in this case, the scene of his almost-fatal accident. <br />In a nutshell, this book is good for long-time readers of Stephen King. I'm not sure it's quite as good for people who want to read / learn about writing, as it says mostly things that have been said before. But in no way is this book uninteresting, or not worth reading. Even these things that you've heard before are well written, well explained &amp; all in all worth taking a look at.	2000-12-15
US	52531272	R11HTDEXLNV4JN	067102437X	911982934	Just Checking	Books	3	2	6	N	N	psychology-light	Did I like this book, & specifically the author? No. Did I find the book interesting? yes, at least partly.<br />\\"Just checking\\", seems to have been written in a hurry. It's as if the author decided to jot down some of her experiences, making them into little passages, with a cute title each. Does this note-taking make a book? A book about obsessive-compulsive disorder? No. It just makes a collection of notes on the experience of this disease. So, if you treat this book as a light read, something to finish up in a couple of hours, then fine, it's not bad. If you're looking for a deeper look on this disease, even in the form of a memoir, look elsewhere. <br />One other thing I  didn't appreciate was Colas' character, as portrayed in the book. Most readers commented on her being very \\"funny\\" & \\"sarcastic\\"...at some points, I just found her to be difficult & egocentrical. And not just because of her disease! A disease cannot be an excuse for everything...for example, I didn't much like her distaste for therapy, for no particular reason. Also, the fact that she never really gave any explanations or insights into \\"why\\" she was that way, what pushed her in the direction of this disease. Anyway, apart from all this, I suppose \\"just checking\\" is well-written enough, but to me it's not much of a memoir, since it doesn't show any pain, any self-knowledge that comes out of the disease, any change in the writer's character. Why write a memoir if you haven't got at least some kind of a conclusion?	2000-10-17

In this way, rifts within &amp; between might be sealed, &amp; the languages of our separate lives might come to share syllables, sentences, whole themes that bind us together&quot;.<br />This comes from the preface of &quot;Welcome to my country&quot;. And, if the whole message of the book had to be put in one paragraph, this is the one. Never in this book does Lauren Slater write from a position of power, of &quot;me versus them&quot;. Through her own recovery, through battling her own problems (see &quot;Three Spheres&quot;) she knows what it is to reach out &amp; touch that dark part within ourselves: the fact that she keeps the access open to that part of herself, the &quot;sick&quot; part, open to be used for understanding &amp; relating to patients...this shows a great sensitivity, is not very common, &amp; makes the book interesting &amp; different.<br />Apart from this, the book contains 6 stories of therapy, the first in a group setting, the rest on an individual, one on one basis.  All take place in the boston mental health clinic where the author worked, early in her practice. The stories are not the most original in the world, what makes the book original is SLater's personality &amp; her writing, which often comes close to literature. I'm looking forward to more of her work.	2000-10-05

The answer to the above question (whether Lucy Sullivan actually does get married during the course of this book) should be obvious to any reader, after about page 50: or at least, the person she'll eventially end up with, should be obvious. The fact that Lucy Sullivan has to go through 400 pages, being stubborn &amp; not at all clear-headed, in order to realise what we, the readers, can easily see from the beginning...well, it's a little bit annoying. But then, this book by Marian Keyes is so entertaining that I had to forgive its small flaws. These Bridget Jones type books have a bad thing &amp; a good thing going for them: the bad thing is that they can get addictive (&amp; they ARE: check out your local bookstore, wherever in the world you are, &amp; you'll see that it's filled up with this type of magazine-book). They're addictive &amp; get you used to reading this type of stuff, writing that is funny, in an everyday language, &amp; has no real message other than the fact that it could be talking about everyone. But there's also the good thing about this type of book: if you happen to stumble upon a good one (&amp; &quot;Lucy Sullivan&quot;, as are all of Marian Keyes' books, is a very good example of the genre) they can be so much fun...so relaxing: like a long, hot bath, or an easy gossipy conversation with an old friend, or a cup of hot cocoa. So, since I generally believe that every book (&amp; movie) should be judged by what's it's aspiring to be, &quot;Lucy Sullivan&quot; is a great book.	2000-10-02

The movie stars Melanie Griffith &amp; Michael Douglas &amp;  was supposedly based on this book but  a)they've totally changed the story in the movie, ruining it completely &amp; b)S.Isaacs hasn't written the movie script, which is obvious; all the wit, all the humour, all the interesting, true to life dialogue is gone. Left is an implausible war story that makes a very bad movie indeed.<br />Now, to &quot;Shining through&quot;, the book: I'm a Susan Isaacs fan, have read all her books, &amp; find this one (along with &quot;Red white &amp; blue&quot;, her latest book) not as good as others. The humour, the dry wit, the wonderful &amp; interesting characters are all there. And these are Isaacs' pluses as an author, these are what make her a talented &amp; one-of-a-kind author. What I didn't like about the book was the story itself. I found it too much of a cliche: a secretary that turns out to be a world war II spy &amp; later, a heroine. Please. I've enjoyed &quot;Magic Hour&quot; or &quot;lily white&quot; or even &quot;Compromising positions&quot; much more, because the stories were a delight, true to life, yet intelligent &amp; different: whodunit stories with a twist. &quot;Shining through&quot; is supposedly a story of heroism &amp; patriotism, a story of finding out what you're capable of...it could be twice as good if the author had just stuck to what she can do better: write about a simple, down to earth person who, yes, learns a lot about himself-herself, through strange, different, difficult circumstances. But being a spy in Berlin during world war 2? that's taking it too far, I think. Still, I love Susan Isaac's writing, the actual words she uses, &amp; especially her dry humour. So if you haven't yet discovered this writer, start somewhere else.	2000-10-02

And of course, all the time I was  reading, it was as if I had the radio tuned on to some old, really cool,  rock radio station. At some point I actually put Bruce Springsteen on the  cd player, which provided the perfect background music for the book.<br />So,  to put it in a nutshell: High Fidelity a) makes you laugh out loud &amp; b)  has a lot to do with music. Rob is the narrator, a kind of nice guy,  drifting on &amp; on in a job as the owner of a small, dusty record shop in  London. With him, in the shop, are 2 other people that work there, Dick  &amp; Barry. People who know more about second hand records, bootlegs &amp;  obscure little rock bands, than they do about what's going on right next to  them. As for Rob, he's kind of disillusioned, he has an enormous record  collection, is not though as far gone with music as Dick &amp; Barry...and  has just broken up, after 3 years, with Laura. She has just moved out,  actually. The rest you'll read about.  High Fidelity is just this: an  ordinary story of an ordinary guy. But it's extremely funny, extremely  well-written, and...well, it makes you think you're listening to music in  your head even when the radio is not on. I, for one, ran to the cd player  &amp; dug out  one of my oldest Bruce records, which I hadn't listened to  for ages. High Fidelity surely will  make you feel nostalgic &amp; a little  sentimental about your favourite music. You'll also find yourself somewhere  in its pages. And, last but not least, you'll laugh out loud, &amp; not  just once, but lots of times. Those are the reasons I loved High Fidelity  the first time round, &amp; that's why I loved it again now, 3 years later.	2000-09-07

And yes, it's also much better than I expected. I  was sceptical about the author's ability to write the fourth book because  of all the pressure of so many people breathlessly waiting for it...Also,  the first 3 books covered all sorts of stuff, had many twists &amp; turns,  lots of humour, &amp; lots of information on the characters. So I thought  it was kind of hard to match up to all that. Was I right? No!(luckily for  me &amp; everybody else)<br />I think the Goblet of Fire is the best, so far,  in the series, for 2 simple reasons: a) it's almost tripple the size of the  previous books (it resembles a small dictionary &amp; almost scares you off  when you first lay eyes on it) so it's even bigger a success, since  J.K.Rowling manages to keep you surprised &amp; anxious throughout the  whole thing &amp; b) this book marks a sort of turning point in the series,  which you'll find out when reaching the last page. But enough said already.  If you belong to the small minority that hasn't yet enjoyed the Harry  Potter books, stop resisting &amp; start reading: it's one of those few  cases when being in the minority doesn't have anything good about it-  you're just missing a rare treat!	2000-08-21

First of all, it's longer than the first 2 &amp; makes for an excellent, satisfying, quite  long read. Second, the first 2 were also very interesting &amp;  imaginative, but this one has all sorts of twists &amp; turns &amp; strange  subplots that make it gripping. Third, it's extremely funny: the new  classes that the third year (by now) students have to attend...Hagrid's  attempts to being a teacher, Hermione's extreme anxiety when it comes to  studying &amp; getting good results...all these stories &amp; many others  in the book, will make you laugh out loud several times. Also, the ending  is extremely unexpected, turns the whole story around, and shows what a  good writer Joan Rowlings is.	2000-07-31

Yes, I know I'm being a little bit harsh, &amp; I know that some of the &quot;contemporary-light-easy to read-supposedly modern romances&quot; are better than others. But after  having read at least 20 of these, I'm starting to feel as if I've read one  too many.<br />&quot;The making of Minty Malone&quot; by Isabel Wolff was one  of the books I bought this summer, while on vacation &amp; desperate to  have something to read on the plane. The truth though is that I could have  chosen it anyway, in a bookstore, since I have a soft spot for this kind of  book after reading everything by Marian Keyes &amp; Helen Fielding. But  that's the point: Marian Keyes &amp; Helen Fielding write well, &amp; their  books stand out &amp; would have done so even if they had decided to write  about something else. The same cannot be said about all the other writers  deciding to write this kind of novel: it's as if they all follow an exact  formula. Single woman, living lonely &amp; sad &amp; usually ditched in  London preferably. Two or three close friends around her. A job that, as  the book develops, gets better, as new opportunities appear out of nowhere  &amp; our heroine becomes more assertive by the moment, &quot;gets in touch  with her true feelings&quot; &amp; grabs these chances. And of course in  the end, there's always an almost perfect for everyone, (but definitely  perfect for the heroine) man. They live happily ever after &amp; we're left  to wander what the hell is wrong with our everyday life, since it doesn't  seem to change so dramatically &amp; so easily...<br />Isabel Wolff's book  follows the above formula exactly. So it's both good &amp; bad. It's a good  plane-ride book, good for a few laughs (sometimes because of the  incredulity of everything that's going on). But after the plane-ride (&amp;  the read) is over...so is the book. You immediately forget about it &amp;  go on to discover the next Minty Malone-Lucy Sullivan-Bridget Jones etc  etc. The only thing I could wish were that more women had these heroins'  luck because the world would be a better (&amp; easier to live in) world.  Since it's not, we can only dream, &amp; once in a while, pick up one of  these books....	2000-07-31

The characters that I came to know &amp; like in  the first book were all there (Harry, Hagrid, Hermione &amp; Ron), the  humour was there, &amp; of course the mystery was there...culminating in an  interesting &amp; unexpected ending. If I absolutely HAD to look for a flaw  in book number two, the only thing I'd say is that it's not that different  from book 1. And therefore it doesn't take you so much by surprise as the  first one does. The third book in the series (The prisoner of Azkaban) is,  I believe, much better than the first 2 books. But anyway: these are all  details: the point is that the Harry Potter books are clear, pure fun &amp;  even if one is a little better or a little worse than the other, all in  all, the four books (up till now) are all very worth reading.	2000-07-31

Anne Fadiman, a talented essayist, decided to write about her love for books, and did so with great humour and sensitivity. This book is, in essence, a series of essays on books, not only on the content of books, but also on their smell, their look, their spines, their lovely paper pages. For everyone who finds bookstores to be the perfect place, this is the perfect book! Not particularly long (&amp; this is the reason for the 4 stars, because I wanted more!) but very warm, which makes up for the fact that it ends too soon... <br />I particularly liked the essay &quot;the odd shelf&quot;. I also liked &quot;Marrying Libraries&quot;, the part where she talks about a couple (herself &amp; her husband) finally deciding to merge their book collections. As she notes, this is the ultimate test of commitment! Imagine: There are books that both will have, so one copy possibly has to be chosen, so as to save space- There are books that maybe have to be thrown out!! (THE most difficult, almost impossible task for me)- There are books to be sorted out, put side by side, organized. And of course there are many different organizing systems that have to be debated. Anne Fadiman finds all this to be a test of patience, of putting things behind you &amp; moving on to new things, a test of love even. For everyone who loves books &amp; their book collection, this is easy to understand.<br />Another interesting part is the description of 2 kinds of people: people who treat their books with great dilligence, who won't write anything on them so as to keep the pages pristine white, who won't crack the spine, who in general look after their books in an almost obssesive way! These people Fadiman calls &quot;courtly lovers&quot; of books. Then there are the people who write continuously in the margins, who crack the book-spine loudly &amp; with relish, who lend their favourites aroundwithout much thought (&amp; of course end up losing them). These are called the &quot;carnal lovers&quot; of books! I happen to belong to the second group...<br />All in all, an interesting and enjoyable book.My only complaint is that it was too short. I hope Anne Fadiman writes another book of essays soon.	2000-07-01

A journey we'll all have to embark on, sooner or later (hopefully, later), since we're all going to die. Gale  Warner was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 30 and lived  13  more months. In these months, she wrote in her journal about her thoughts,  her insights, her struggle, her pain, and finally her acceptance and  serenity: But it was never easy, never simple. Gale Warner saw cancer as  the ultimate test of her faith (her particular, private sort of faith). She  worked and struggled with her own mortality. In her own  words-<br />&quot;Limits. In order to boil water, you must put it in a pot.  The pot sets a limit and so does cancer. When you learn you are not  immortal, that you may only have a few years to embrace life, you start  doing so. The photo of the Earth on my wall shows its beauty- and its  limits. It would not be the same if those same colors and swirls were  sloshed all over space&quot;.<br />&quot;Dancing at the edge of life&quot; is  an important book, because in the end, everybody has to find their own  answers or anyway, start asking their own questions. I would recommend this  book to anyone and of course, not only to people with cancer. You don't  have to get diagnosed with lymphoma to start thinking of the  &quot;big&quot; questions, you don't have to wait to have cancer in order  to learn how to live.<br />Another reason that makes this memoir important, is  that Gale Warner must have been a very special, intelligent &amp; sensitive  person. She had worked as an environmental journalist &amp; was also an  accomplished poet. A person that fully embraced life was ultimately able to  fully embrace the journey towards death.	2000-06-24

And yes, the story of 4 friends &amp; each one's joys &amp; sorrows is not the most original concept in the world: But the  strength of this particular novel is that it's extremely well written &amp;  so much fun: it's a story that could really be about any of us, the themes  are so familiar. &quot;The saving graces&quot; underline what most of us  already know, that friends are the relatives we chose, the family we form  for ourselves, whereas when it comes to our actual families, we don't have  a choice.<br />Patricia Gaffney, from what I've heard (because this is the  first book of hers that I've read) usually writes different kind of novels,  historical romances etc. But I don't know why- she seems to be a natural in  telling a contemporary, real, easy-to-read story. <br />This book is about the  friendship of 4 women, around 40 years old: Rudy, Isabel, Emma &amp; Lee.  They meet twice a month for dinner &amp; share secrets, talk about their  lives, laugh a lot and sometimes cry. What women-friends do in real life,  actually: and this is this novel's strength: although it's not the most  substantial or inspired book in the world, it's one of the best books in  the &quot;light reading&quot; category, since it's as if the story is taken  out of real life. It's one of those novels that the reader gets totally  engrossed in, so it's a very good selection for a weekend away or for a  long airplane ride.  You'll have a great time reading it...	2000-06-19

That is true, but then on the other hand, never, while reading this book, did I get the impression that  Alain de Botton was trying to replace Proust. I don't think he was  trying  to offer a guide to Proust, nor trying to write literary criticism or  anything like that: After finishing the book, the impression I got was that  this is more a self-help book (and quite a witty and funny one, actually,  much better than the usual saccharine-sweet self help books) and less a  book about Proust. The good thing is that &quot;How Proust can change your  life&quot; will probably give you an appetite for more Marcel Proust...and  that has to do with the clarity and lightness of touch with which de Botton  writes: you can't resist his admiration for Proust, even though you might  have objections to the way he chose to express this admiration: but then  who says that books about philosophy or about literature have to be dead  serious and heavy? I think Alain de Botton has written an original  book, a  book that's a kind of experiment, as it combines self-help insights with  good literature and important ideas. If you read this as such, as an  interesting experiment which may bring more people to Proust, then you  won't really be able to find any fault in the book.	2000-06-19

Mr Robertson, the math teacher  with whom Amy experiences lust &amp; love for the first time. Fat Bev, a  nurturant, kind woman who ultimately helps Isabelle face up to her past  &amp; start opening up...<br />The descriptions of the weather or of other  minor characters (especially the men, who all seem wooden &amp; one  dimensional) sometimes are a little tiring. Also, it's true that some loose  ends remain in the end, but then, life itself often doesn't tidy everything  up. <br />The small town life of Shirley Falls is beautifully created, the  painful but in the end cathartic relationship between mother and daughter  is believable and true to life. The book is also very funny at times, for  example I couldn't help laughting out loud when Isabelle was pathetically  trying to read Hamlet. And in the end, Amy and Isabelle is one of those  books that mark the beginning of a promising writing career. I look forward  to reading Elizabeth Strout's next novel.	2000-06-16

Rowling brings  back memories of C.S. Lewis, Roald Dahl, &amp; also those old-fashioned but  brilliant books about life &amp; adventures in english boarding houses. A  &quot;struggling single mother&quot; (as the book cover mentions) turns out  to be a great talent, &amp; the Harry Potter books are destined to become  children classics. The first book in the series was not only exciting &amp;  extremely imaginative. It was, most importantly, very very funny, &amp; all  in all, a rare treat.	2000-06-12

It's a completely different book than her later ones- the books Isaacs wrote after this were all very good, funny and suspensful, and quick paced. But Almost  Paradise is special for me, maybe because when I read it I had no idea what  to expect: and what I discovered was a talented, funny, intelligent writer  who decided to write a love story in her own unconventional way: and  what  a love story it is! <br />The story of two people (Jane and Nicholas) who seem  to belong in the real world, who seem to share problems with the majority  of people, and yet...the characters that Susan Isaacs creates become  something different, they become people that'll stick in your mind, people  that you'll think about long after you close the book. An emotional, deep  and at the same time down-to-earth and funny love story- what else can you  ask for?	2000-05-21

The fourth- Marco, who tells the story, has grown up with one and only one dream: to make money someday through writing scripts.  Scripts for tv, for the movies, it doesn't matter, as long as his dream  comes true. Four people whose life is the telling of stories, but who for  the moment, have no one to tell their stories to. <br />So what happens when  these four losers get the chance to write a tv script together? A cheap  script, with the participation of 10 actors at the most, which will be  aired from 4 to 5 every morning: the time that most tv screens are turned  off. A program written off from day one, created only to cover the hours of  french-produced programmes that the law demands. That's exactly what the  producer tells the scriptwriters: &quot;Write whatever you want, at the  lowest possible cost. No one will watch it anyway&quot;.<br />Tonino  Benacquista's &quot;Saga&quot; begins this way, and it's a book that turns  upside down any idea you might have about tv and tv production. In this  program, total freedom is allowed. The 2 families in the series do whatever  comes to the minds of the scriptwriters. Sometimes their dialogue is  totally true to life (the so-called &quot;fifteen minutes of  honesty&quot;)and sometimes they are totally surreal. Science fiction,  Freud &amp; psychoanalysis, marxism and arlequin romances also have a role  to play in the dialogues...<br />Saga is a dangerous but really enjoyable dive  into the world of total freedom. An unimportant tv program slowly starts  becoming cult and lots of people start watching it fanatically. After a  while, it's transfered to the &quot;prime time&quot; tv zone, and at some  point, the freedom that was given to the scriptwriters, to write whatever  they want, turns into a bomb ready to explode. Saga and it's anarchic  messages become the number one discussion topic in France. <br />This book is  a gread black comedy, a book which humorously criticizes the world of  television. It's also a book about stories, and about people who write  stories for a living. It's one of those really intelligent and enjoyable  books that you won't be able to put down before you reach the final page.	2000-05-20

I've read Tully so far at least five times, especially certain parts  of it...and I'm certain I'll read it again in the future.<br />But why such a  fuss over a first novel by an unknown american author? (whose two  subsequent books, by the way, didn't even come close to Tully).One of the  reasons I loved Tully was Tully herself: a one of a kind, special woman who  grows up under horrible circumstances, but still learns how to survive, and  even how to give and take love. A woman who got to me, for some reason,  maybe just because she's tough and at the same time very  vulnerable.<br />Paullina Simmons wrote her heart out in this book. Especially  the second part of the novel is exquisite: in it you'll find a powerful  love story, not a soap-opera kind of love story, but a true to life  description of people and feelings. People who have to make choices and  have to live with their choices afterwards. People who learn that love  isn't a moment but a whole process, and who learn, in time,  to appreciate  what's important. <br />All in all, Tully is one of those books that'll take  over your life for a  couple of days. So chose a quiet weekend and read it.	2000-05-14

Books	5	46	50	N	N	one of the best modern plays	A play in three acts, a very simple setting, and only four characters who live in a small, university town in America: a middle-aged couple, Martha and George. And  a &quot;young and innocent&quot;  couple, Nick and Honey.  They all meet in a room, in Martha and George's house, very late one night,  for a nightcap. And then...all hell breaks lose.<br />The play tears apart  both marriages: the middle aged couple, who seem to hate each other and in  the end turn out to be much more devoted to each other as it would seem.  The young, seemingly perfect couple, who turn out to have lots of problems  of their own. In three heart-breaking scenes, using dialogue that cuts like  a knife, Edward Albee has written a masterpiece. He manages to give a  clear-cut, honest picture of the reality of marriage, the reality of love,  and the fears that go hand in hand with love and intimacy. At some point,  in act three, Martha talks about her husband- and it's probably one of the  best pieces of literature I've read:<br />&quot;...George who is out somewhere  there in the dark...George who is good to me, and whom I revile; who  understands me, and whom I push off; who can make me laugh, and I choke it  back in my throat; who can hold me, at night, so that it's warm, and whom I  will bite so there's blood; who keeps learning the games we play as quickly  as I can change the rules; who can make me happy and I do not wish to be  happy, and yes I do wish to be happy, George and Martha: sad, sad,  sad.&quot;<br />What more can I say? just read the play, and if you get the  chance, watch it performed in the theatre, too.	2000-05-09

After you  reach the last of the 250 very well written pages,you realise that Jeffrey  Eugenides hasn't revealed anything more than you knew from page one: the  only thing the reader knows is that the 5 blond, almost indistinguishable  Lisbon sisters commit suicide one by one.<br />The story is told through the  eyes and ears of the neighbourhood boys. Teenage boys who are obssessed  with the Lisbon sisters and watch their lives and deaths (or what they know  of their lives and deaths) step by step. So, in the end, all we get to know  about this tragic story, is through these teenage boys' eyes. It's like we  are watching the chorus in an  ancient greek tragedy: the chorus watches  from afar, feels sorrow and pain, but doesn't know or reveal much.<br />This  fact of not knowing, of not understanding the whys and the hows of the  story, adds an almost surreal quality to the book. Eugenides is a very  gifted new author, and manages to create a great book, even though with the  total absence of characterization (the 5 sisters are almost described as  one single person)as well as the total absence of feeling or explanation,  this could prove to be tricky. But he does it skillfully and in the end,  this fact of not knowing adds to the book.<br />A very sad, mysterious, deeply  moving novel, a novel where the reader has to read between the lines to  feel and understand. My only complaint was the short length of the book,  but all in all: I strongly recommend it	2000-05-07

The first was &quot;midwives&quot; &amp; when I bought the &quot;law of similars&quot; I at least expected something as good, or a little bit better than his  previous book. Instead, what I found was an almost exact replica of  &quot;midwives&quot;: the same subject--alternative medicine. And almost  the same way of looking at alternative medicine: One woman who works in  this field (here, the specific field is homeopathy)gets in trouble when a  death occurs and doubts begin to arise as to whether this woman and the  &quot;medicine&quot; she practised had anything to do with the death. In  both books, the author gives a lot of information on alternative medicine,  but not in a preachy way. This is good, because we get to know a lot of  stuff about midwives (in one book) and homeopathy (in this one), and  specifically, we are given both the arguments for and against both types of  alternative medicine.<br />But where &quot;midwives&quot; was a page-turner,  &quot;the law of similars&quot; is much slower, and all in all, predictable  and boring. It's as if Chris Bohjalian decided to write a kind of  &quot;sequel&quot; to his previous book, but couldn't get it quite right.  Since he's a competent writer, and can definitely produce best-selling  books, it would be best, in my opinion, if he looked elsewhere for his  subject matter.	2000-05-05

In this book, Peck (well known from \\"the road less travelled\\") formulates a new  psychological theory: he tries to prove, through well told case studies,  that some people are, as he calls them, \\"people of the lie\\", or  in other words, evil. He thinks that being evil goes way beyond narcissism  personality disorder, or other psychological disorders that psychiatrists /  psychotherapists could think of. Scott Peck's point of view therefore  transcends scientific thought, and makes a leap into religious thinking.  Although he himself knows how dangerous it is to label someone as evil,  although he himself warns time and again, in his book,of the thin line  between narcissism and an evil personality...he still doesn't manage to  prove his point, in my opinion at least.<br /><br />Because in the end, it IS  dangerous, very dangerous, to put these kinds of labels on people. The  basic question to be answered is -who will make this judgment? I think that  no-one should consider himself able or should be allowed to make this kind  of judgment. Plus, most of the cases described by Scott Peck in the book  could probably be seen, in another light, as narcissistic personality  disorders, and thus, could be dealed with in other ways, and obviously not  with exorcism, as the author unbelievably suggests. Of course, this also  has to do with somebody's belief system. At least Scott Peck takes his time  to explain what he believes in, he uses well thought out arguments and in  general he writes very well. Also, in his favour, he never becomes  phanatical or preachy: he always expresses his doubts. Nevertheless, I  deeply disagree with the basic premise of this book. I believe people are  just people, not gods, not devils, and they should be treated, healed,  helped as people. And so, even though the writing itself pleased me, even  though the book is well organised and at some points interesting, I cannot  really recommend it.	2000-05-03

The  opinion that I've formed so far, that Irving is a superb writer, hasn't  changed. However, there were both good and less than good things about  &quot;The Cider house rules&quot; which is the reason for the 3 star  rating.<br />First of all, John Irving has a gift when it comes to character  development: he consistently describes interesting, different, strange,  very original people: and he does this in such a subtle and sensitive way,  that after finishing each of his books, you have the feeling you know each  and every character very well. This is one of the good points of the cider  house rules: Homer Wells, Melony, Dr Larch are all unique and interesting  chararters...but after having read other John Irving books, the reader has  come to expect characters like these, so it doesn't come so much as a  surprise. <br />I also liked the handling of the abortion issue: John Irving  doesn't preach, he gives both sides of the story, and helps us realise how  nothing is ever black or white. However, by the end of the book, his own  opinion is clearly stated, but not in a &quot;bossy&quot; way...<br />What  I  didn't like about the book was that first, I thought it was very slow paced  and at times boring, especially after &quot;Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;  which is much funnier &amp; never boring. Also, I thought the end was  totally predictable: you could tell, almost from the beginning what the  conclusion would be. Finally, I was a little bit disappointed by some of  the choices the characters made: John Irving built up an almost hero-like  character (Homer Wells), a strong, talented &amp; intelligent person...but  he  compromised on many levels, especially when it came to his personal  life.<br />Having said all this: I would still whole-heartedly recommend Cider  House Rules, but I don't think it's one of the best novels by John Irving.  I still haven't seen the movie &amp; I look forward to watching Michael  Caine play the part of Dr Larch.	2000-04-29

It's the second book I read by Sara Lewis (the other one, &quot;But I love you  anyway&quot; was slightly better, I think) &amp; I'm convinced now that  this must be what the author tries to do- she aims to make the reader feel  better about themselves, after finishing the book. And how does she do  this? Well, she creates these characters that have all sorts of flaws,  &amp; that usually are going through a rough patch in their lives...&amp;  then she describes, step by step, how everything changes for the  better.<br />If you're looking for a deep look into relationships, if you're  looking for three dimensional characters, if, in other words, you're not  looking for a self-help-type, easy to read book...then this is not the book  for you. If on the other hand you're taking a day off work &amp; want to  curl up in bed with a comforting, light book, this is a good choice. The  fact that you'll probably forget about it 10 minutes later doesn't take  away its value. Funny, warm books like this one can be very good company.  And Sara Lewis is a good writer, in that she does what she sets out to do:  she writes books that make the reader feel a little bit better, a little  bit more optimistic.	2000-04-28
US	52531272	RY7SPIFUVJ3LH	0670887315	929204920	Disgrace	Books	4	41	47	N	N	Disgrace deserved the Booker Prize	The reason I bought this book, was- as many others before me- because it won the 1999 Booker Prize. I wasn't disappointed: It was a good opportunity to discover a talented writer, whose work I hadn't come across before,  &amp; I'll certainly return to his work. Disgrace is the story, or a part  of the story of David Lurie, a middle aged, twice divorced, disillusioned,  burnt out professor of literature at a university of Cape Town. After an  impulsive affair with a student, Lurie loses his job (in a way, willingly)  &amp; moves to a farm somewhere in South Africa, to live with his daughter  for a while.  There, Lurie &amp; his daughter have to deal with the harsh  realities of post-apartheid South Africa, on a day to day basis, &amp; also  with the harsh reality of their own relationship. More details would spoil  the reading of the book!  so I'll just go on with my impressions upon  finishing it. First of all, Coetzee's writing is precise, sparse and to the  point, &amp; that's definitely a good reason to read this book. The reader  has to read between the lines to understand &amp; empathize with David  Lurie. Feelings &amp; relationships are not described in detail- you just  have to use your own thoughts &amp; feelings in order to step into the  world of Disgrace. It's a very human story. It's about human frailty, about  mistakes, even about sins. There is no easy conclusion, no easy redemption.  No rising above the disillusionment. But there is an ending that signifies  a letting go of the past, &amp; the hope for a new beginning, at least  that's the way I saw it. All in all, it's a book that can be read on many  different levels, an interesting book, not only because of the information  we get about South Africa, but also because of its honest, almost brutal  portrayal of a &quot;fallen&quot; man who's struggling to go on living.	2000-04-26
US	52531272	RSRBQVE6VTHPF	0060930934	609366713	Wasted : A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia	Books	4	1	1	N	N	an honest look on eating disorders	Marya Hornbacher's book kept me awake a couple of nights, reading. It's a terrifying book, an honest, brutal, personal account of her eating disorder, an eating disorder that came close to killing her. <br />What I specifically liked was that eating disorders are not seen in a simplistic way in this book. They are seen as the complex &amp; dangerous problems they are. Reading this book, you'll probably feel disgusted, angry, and surely sad at times. But mostly you'll take a deep look into the image that society makes us strive toward: the image of the perfect, beautiful, succesful, thin at all costs, calm &amp; controlled individual. I think these stereotypes are extremely dangerous, &amp; they make people (such as the author herself) get caught up in their image &amp; forget about their soul &amp; their true needs. Killing yourself, slowly, just to achieve the &quot;perfect&quot; body, the perfect image, is a trap that unfortunately many, many women (and men,too) fall into nowadays. It's probably society's way of keeping women &quot;in their right place&quot;. <br />Hornbacher's book is very disturbing because it's very personal. It doesn't hold anything back, it describes the lies, the self-deceit, the ignoring of friends &amp; family that love you, the secret pride in the identity you've achieved, even though it's a fundamentally problematic identity...&amp; of course the actual medical danger that comes with eating disorders. I think it's an intelligent look on the subject, useful for anybody who wants to learn more about it. <br />I especially appreciated the fact that nothing was black or white, not even recovery: Marya Hornbacher accepts that recovery is an ongoing process, an everyday struggle that she'll have to live with for the rest of her life, &amp; this makes the book even more honest &amp; real. The ending of the book is not really an ending in the way we usually mean the word: it's more some kind of conclusion, the beginning of new things, &amp; theslow but steady change that has started to happen in her life.	2000-03-27

Whatever category you try to &quot;fit&quot; him in...he'll always escape categorization. I believe R. Carver is one of the most talented american writers of the century. His short stories are amazing in that they always  let you step into the world of his characters. Whoever said that his  stories are &quot;slices of life&quot; was correct. And most importantly,  slices of everyday life, of the life of real people, people that you'll  identify with, people that'll make you cry, laugh or that'll just remind  you of somebody you know. I don't think his stories are depressing as some  people have said- it's true that the ending of each one always leaves you a  little sad...but that's just life, isn't it? What I find beautiful is the  way Raymond Carver ends each story. In a way there's no conclusion. After a  scene, a &quot;slice  of life&quot; is described, the story just...ends.  Abruptly. Which makes you think, makes you feel things, makes you imagine  where the people you got to know &amp; like in the story would get to be  the next day... The whole book is very good literature, recommended  wholeheartedly...but the stories I'd select as my personal favourites, the  ones that I thought were heartbreaking &amp; very human, were: &quot;The  student's wife&quot;, &quot;Cathedral&quot;, &quot;Fat&quot;, &quot;Why  don't you dance?&quot;, &quot;Distance&quot;, &quot;whoever was using this  bed&quot; and &quot;blackbird pie&quot;....	2000-03-24

I'm glad I read the other two books first, because they make  a better introduction to the writer / psychiatrist's work. &quot;Every day  gets a little closer&quot; is a much more &quot;closed&quot; book, meaning  that it takes some time &amp; patience to get through it.<br />What it is the  account of Ginny Elkin's (pseudonym) therapy, written from the point of  view of both Dr. Yalom, &amp; Ginny. It is often striking how these 2  points of view can be so different! &amp; yet, while reading this book, you  get a definite sense of the therapeutic relationship developing, of the  existing &amp; growing feelings between doctor &amp; patient.<br />The down  side is that the book is definitely slow, although very rewarding at times.  But then, the therapeutic process itself is slow. What I found really  interesting was the afterword by Dr. Yalom which describes the process  &amp; the methods he used while treating Ginny. It put a new light on the  whole book, which at times seemed chaotic.<br />All in all, definitely give  this book a go if you're interested in the therapy relationship, in the  magic &amp; slow change that occurs in the therapist's office. But don't  expect a quick &amp; easy read, because you'll be disappointed.	2000-03-13

The good thing about it is that the author (Shay Youngblood) is talented, this is her first novel &amp; she's done a good job. It's a &quot;coming of age&quot; story of a  young girl who is deserted by her drug-addicted mother, &amp; who tries to  make sense of life &amp; to deal with her pain. The story is well told  &amp; there are some very touching scenes...The only thing I didn't like  was that the book was kind of short, meaning that the characters I think  were not that well developed, &amp; the story itself left some loose ends.  Shay Youngblood seems to be a creative &amp; inspired writer, so I look  forward to reading her next books in order to see whether she's developed  her writing style.	2000-02-23

A friend brings them as a gift, you store them somewhere in the kitchen, supposedly because you'll just eat one at a time..but then one friday night you just  eat them all in one go. <br />This is that kind of book. You read it in one  go, in a couple of hours &amp; then feel as if you just indulged  yourself..this book is, in my opinion, definitely NOT literature &amp; you  shouldn't treat it as such. <br />It's about this single woman who cannot get  over this guy who dumped her, even though they had only been going out for  a couple of months, even though there were all these signs that he was not  at all reliable (he was cheating on his long time girlfriend AND constantly  put her down,  he got intimate with Jane immediately..sure signs of a  loser) but Jane for some mysterious reason didn't see through all this  &amp; instead was shocked &amp; hurt when he left her...Afterwards, she  spends over a year crying over the breakup, which is basically  unbelievable. When did she manage to even begin to love this guy? they only  went out for 2-3 months...<br />Still, this could have been a good book, an  entertaining light read..but I didn't even find it that funny. There are  far more humorous books in the &quot;read it like you would a  magazine&quot; category- books by Marian Keyes, or by Helen Fielding..	2000-02-20

It seems that this book was succesful when it came out, &amp; it drove the author to write quite a few  &quot;sequels&quot; like &quot;Notes on how to live in the world &amp;  still be happy&quot; or &quot;notes to each other&quot;. This fact on its  own (the fact that sequels exist! ) made me doubt the writer but I decided  to give the book a go anyway..I finished it in about 2 hours, since it's  extremely short. What it is basically is a collection of thoughts &amp;  insights about all sorts of different things: life, death, family, love-  insights that, in my opinion, may have been illuminating for the author  himself, when he thought about them, but I don't understand how somebody  else could benefit from these one-liners. It would be very easy if life  could change that easily- through reading self help books that just state  some thoughts but never describe the journey it took the author to get  there. If you want to read something to really make you think &amp; feel  things, chose something by, for example, Herman Hesse. If you just want an  easy, short read, chose this but don't expect a lot.	2000-02-19

I will just add a few things that  particularly impressed me with this book- On the one hand, the novel begins  with an intriguing first paragraph that just makes you want to read on and  on. The last phrase of the book, on the other hand, is heartbreaking &amp;  it just haunts you for days after you finish the book. Apart from that: in  &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; you will find at least 3 of the  funniest scenes you've ever encountered: the christmas pageant, the VW  rolling down the stairs, &amp; Owen under the bed of a couple having sex.  Especially in the &quot;VW&quot; scene I just laughed &amp; laughed, I  couldn't control myself!  Plus 3 scenes I have in mind will probably make  you cry but you'd better discover them yourself. I don't want to reveal too  much about the story itself..I'd just like to say that A Prayer for Owen  Meany is the kind of book you'll pick up &amp; then forget about anything  else for about 3 days..So start reading on a weekend.  All in all- one of  my favourite books of all time.	2000-02-15

This has an advantage- it keeps your mind off death. Believing you still can do  whatever you want, act as you feel...this keeps you young, at least in your  head! This is what happens to Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom, who cannot  accept he's not the star of the basketball team anymore, cannot accept he's  older, has responsibilities, has a less than glamorous job &amp; a less  than exciting marriage. Instead of coping with his life, making the best  out of it, Rabbit choses to just follow his instinct &amp; run. While  running away, from place to place &amp; from relationship to relationship,  Rabbit never finds what he's looking for, always returns to this empty  feeling inside himself, this fear of death, of things ending, of things  changing, of time passing. Rabbit doesn't face this fear though...he just  continues running away.  Rabbit Run is a sad, sad story, with a tragic  ending, a story that could appeal to anyone since it talks about our  deepest fears &amp; anxieties. John Updike writes beautifully, I'm really  looking forward to reading more of his books.	2000-02-11
US	52531272	R1AC7W4RDEJUXD	0385484518	725864791	Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, A Young Man and Life's Greatest Lesson	Books	1	40	53	N	N	I was very disappointed	I bought  this book with great expectations- I knew it was about a man at the end of his life, but I expected a deep look into his way of thinking, into his philosophy..instead, what I found was a mere outline of a wonderful person (Morrie Schwartz)...and lots of details about the author  himself, that I'm sorry to say I didn't care about at all. All this running  around &amp; working non stop for money, that Mitch Albom talks about as if  it's the only way somebody could live..I just disagree. Not everyone is  like that, not everyone has to talk to his old teacher to get the idea that  you have to really listen to &amp; love the people around you. For some  reason, Mitch Albom found this to be a very new &amp; strange way of  thinking, but in my opinion, it is the first &amp; most important thing  somebody should learn in order to live a full life, &amp; to give to people  around him. I don't know how I managed to finish this book- I found myself  constantly annoyed by the author &amp; his disbelief in everything that  Morrie did or said- the fact that he didn't feel sorry for himself, the  fact that he didn't realise he was at a dead end. Of course Morrie was in  pain, of course he knew it was all over. But the fact that he had lived  life to the fullest made him strong enough to accept death. I have no idea  why this was so hard for Albom to understand. So the one thing that stays  with me after closing the book is Morrie himself, his great courage &amp;  his honest &amp; clear way of looking at life &amp; death.	2000-02-04

It's a very personal account of the relationship between Kafka &amp; his father, his  strong, controling, tough father who was the main figure who influenced  Kafka's life &amp; way of thinking. Franz Kafka talks with great pain in  this 'letter' about his childhood years &amp; how his father controlled  everyone in the household, how the writer's own personality was shaped  &amp; molded by this one relationship. After reading this letter, the  reader is closer to understanding the person that wrote  &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; &amp; &quot;The Judgment&quot;.	2000-02-01

In the course of life, there is sadness and pain and sorrow, all of which, in their right time and season, are normal-  unpleasant, but normal. Depression is in an altogether different zone  because it involves a complete absence: absence of affect, absence of  feeling, absence of response, absence of interest\\".(taken from the  first chapter of Prozac Nation, 'Full of Promise').  I finished reading  Prozac Nation a couple of days ago & it's still on my mind. The first  thing someone would think after finishing this book is \\"how self  absorbed can this girl be?\\". But that's exactly the point! Depression  brings so much pain or even worse, absence of feeling, to the person who  suffers...sometimes there is no room for anything else except the pain.  The thing any depressed person wishes is for this intensity of feeling to  end, for the chance to spend energy on others, to turn your eyes away from  yourself. Elizabeth Wurtzel is very succesful in describing what goes on  exactly in the mind of a truly depressed person. Whatever the reasons that  brought you there depression is an illness & a very tough one to  recover from & Wurtzel does a very good job of explaining her own fight  with depression, without putting blame on anyone in particular,  understanding that the exact same circumstances may lead one person to  depression and the next person to a happy, fulfilled life.	2000-02-01

It is the kind of book you read in one go, so indulge yourself one evening, slow down &amp; read it from cover  to cover. I didn't give this book a 5 star rating because that would mean I  rate it as one of the best books I've ever read, which isn't true. But it's  one of those books that are uplifting, although realistic, well written,  although not the best literature you can imagine, &amp; all in all, it's a  story that is taken out of everyday life (even the happy ending!). If you  haven't read a good, fast paced novel for a while, try this book.	1998-11-14

So I was quite disappointed when I read this book- although it is a  page-turner, this is not what I expected from Simons. I couldn't believe in  the characters, &amp; I found the end predictable. All in all, the book  read like a movie screenplay. It's a shame because I think Paullina Simons  is very talented &amp; is capable of a lot more.	1998-10-15
