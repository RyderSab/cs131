I must admit this  is a very readable and recommendable book not only for gay and lesbian people but also for heterosexual people.  However  to my surprise, the book is attached too much importance to the Western countries.  As for the history of same-sex loves, Christendom did not have great importance.  And I wonder why Mr. Crompton didn't refer to the Arabian, Persian, Indian and Korean same-sex loves.  In addition, I found many misspellings of proper nouns ( e.g. \\" Cataline \\" in page 82, of course it must be \\" Catilina \\",  and \\" Sei Shoganon \\" in page 413, of course it must be \\" Sei Shonagon \\", etc. etc.	2004-10-26

I purchased it about 10 years ago in USA with Jim Kepner's &quot;Becoming a people...&quot; and Terry Boughner's &quot;Out of All Time&quot;. They are very nice and intersting volumes.

I recommend it for everybody who is interested in the history, especially for young and ignorant  people.       But even I, a common Japanese, am able to indicate several elemental mistakes  and  numerous absences of interesting historical-stories , anecdotes  and episodes on Chinese Emperors & Imperial courts ; not only incests and homosexualities , but also cannibalismus(anthropophagies), zoophilies(bestialities)  and assassinations with poisons , tortures, & other special methods etc.    In Chinese Chronicles compiled by the government of each dynasty are filled up with so many cruel deeds , atrocities  and intrigues by Empress, Princes and eunuchs et al . If you can read the ancient Chinese texts, you will surely  find the history of China is much more \\"curiouser and curiouser\\" than the history of Roman empire.    (CAUTION !     Be careful.   All printed matters are severely  censored by the Communist Government/authorities.     Therefore perfect texts are very difficult to obtain in the mainland China.    It is far much  easier to purchase them in Japan or Taiwan(Formosa).   And almost of all Chinese people are miserably ignorant on their own history, because they can't read original texts.)	2001-08-23

For us Japanese citizens the religious documents so called \\"The Bible\\" or \\"The Scriptures\\" are nothing but a superstitional data of exclusive monotheism = Judaeo-Christianity.  And ,I think some chapters of the book are not suitable for the name of \\"Homosexuality\\", e.g. Ruth and Naomi --- because their mutual affections are or were very common relationships in Japanese women , and nothing special ones. Et aussi , the love between David and Jonathan is an elemental feeling which every humankind has , not only between the same-sex members but also between the different-sex ones , like Achilleus and Patroclos, Theseus and Peirithous, Alexander Magnus and Hephaistion, and  Jesus of Nazareth and Johannes etc.    But I recommend the book for anybody who wants to know about the \\" same-sex eroticismus \\" in the Biblical times.	2001-07-18

I was expecting a historical novel about the Byzantine Empire , but in this book I've found a family-drama of the common people in U.S.A.

However, it is regrettable for me that the author didn't mention on the Japanese traditional custom of male-love so much, since in Japan there're more documents and classical texts about &quot;paiderastia&quot; than the ancient Greek, and in premodern Japan male/male love was highly recommended and praised. I suggest three books &quot;Male Color&quot; by Gary P. Leupp , &quot;The Love of the Samurai&quot; by T. Watanabe &amp; J. Iwata, and &quot;Partings at Dawn&quot; to read .	2000-08-29

I prefer to read  a book on male/male love of pre-Tokugawa period, since in those days,  especially in Muromachi/Azuchi-Momoyama-period, male homoeroticism was most flourished  and  prosperous.

It is very interesting to read this kind of book, especially about eunuchs in Byzantion. However I think it is easier to compile such an omnibus-styled collective volume.

If you can read French , I recommend to read the  original &quot;DICTIONNAIRE DE LA MYTHOLOGIE GREQUE ET ROMAINE&quot;  written by P. Grimal himself.    Although English-version has these weak  points, as far as I know , only this book and  William Smith's old  &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography &amp; Mythology&quot; are  worth to read with Greek alphabet spelling of proper noun et sourses of  Classical texts.	2000-04-13

If I may be  allowed to hope more, I wish that the authors have included many historical  episodes &amp; anecdotes too. Of course I know no book is perfect.

In addition some pages of E. Bethe's copy  are blurred-printed or rather almost obliterated making them difficult to  read. Although noticing these weak points, I highly recommend this book for  serious readers because of its excellent quality and minute  research.<br />P.S. I wonder what is &quot;Ancient World&quot; for  English-speaking people, since most of &quot;Ancient&quot; History books  written in English are limited mainly about the Mediterranean region with  Mesopotamia and excluded many other ancient worlds, e.g. ancient India,  ancient China, ancient Japan, ancient America, etc.	2000-04-10

However many Japanese people are not probably contented with the scantiness  of Japanese entries ,and some of these articles  are doubtful or uncertain  about their  sources--- e.g. In the item of FUJIYAMA  there is a famous  story of KAGUYAHIME maybe based on a classical Japanese literature  &quot;Taketori-monogatari&quot;, but the story narrated here is very  different from the original texts , so I wonder on which version the author  took the authority and from what folktale Mr.Cotterell cited  this story ,  I would like to know. I hope that the editor of dictionary should indicate  titles &amp; chapter of sources or reference texts at the end of each item.	2000-04-09

This is a useful book only for young students and ignorant people on classical mythology. I was deeply disappointed when I received this book,since I expected a comprehensive encyclopedia about Greek &amp; Roman  myths .However the book does not contain Greek alphabet spelling of any  Greek proper noun , any source of each item/entry and even genealogical  trees .  Who can name such an  elementay book &quot;Encyclopedia of  Greco-Roman Mythology&quot; on earth ? I wonder for whom this book was  written ?  If it was written for children , the author should have inserted   pictures or illustrations. And if it was written for common readers , the  author should have surpassed at least Michael Grant's &quot;Who's Who in  Classical Mythology&quot; . Only one thing that some place-names are  included is the good characteristics of the book. Anyway I did not buy it ,  if I knew the poverty of its contents.	2000-04-09

The reason is evident. For example, in the item of THOTH  we can not find his Egyptian name DHWTY , &amp; nobody can find pharaoh's  name written in hierogriph encircled with cartouche. When we edit a  dictionary or encyclopedia, if the item is Greek noun, we add Greek  alphabet spelling after Japanese name indicating each vowel is long or  short, et Latin alphabet aussi &amp; at the end of every item, sources or  reference texts.	2000-01-27

However I was extremely astonished at the scantiness of space on Japanese same-sex relation. Since after ancient Greek, only Japanese could have enhanced male-homoeroticism to highly ethical valued SHUDO i.e. the way of male love and there is a great number  of GAY literature,documents, arts etc. in Japan. I recommend two books for  readers THE LOVE OF THE SAMURAI by Watanabe Tsuneo &amp; Iwata Jun'ichi, et  MALE COLORS by Gary P. Leupp.  And I hope many people study Japanese  culture, history and literature  more.	2000-01-27

At first I had read it in Japanese translation and now  again in English,Greek, Latine et Hebraic. I know that  some Fundamentalists want to try polemic defiances with a superstitious  bias. However in JAPAN nobody thinks that same-sex relationship is unusual  or sinful traditionaly --- at least we have some reasoning power never do  think so ---.  Of course there are a few exceptions e.g. the cultists of  dangerous pseudo-religion. As everybody knows very well, that certain dogma  of a religion is or was not often in accord with the social realities  e.g.  Islamic doctrine in pre-modern muslim society where male-boy love was very  popular. Also in Japan , although Buddhist teachings did not always  encourage homoeroticism enthusiastically ,  after ancient Greek only  Japanese could have enhanced male-male sex highly ethical valued SHUDO i.e.  the way of male love.	2000-01-27

But there is one thing to be disappointed that Mr. Leupp didn't treat before Edo period so minutely, because male homosexuality in Japan was much more popular and prosper in pre-Edo period both in samurai society and in the aristocracy, the priesthood also than in Edo period, as many Japanese recognize. From Insei period on, especially in late-Kamakura, Muromachi to Momoyama period, male-male love was highly estimated and enthusiastically celebbrated, and almost of all Shogun i.e. supreme commanders, Daimyo i.e. war lords et Tenno i.e. emperors had their male lovers. Some of famous Daimyo and Tenno never married nor had any heterosexual relationship , for they thought to abstain from sex with women is a brave , manly and pious behavior. There 're so many documents &amp; literal texts e. g. Anthology of paiderastia just like the Greek Musa paidike by Straton. Even quasi-marriage ceremony between men NENKEI was usually performed, and several famous Shogun &amp; Daimyo were assasinated out of male-love jealousy or homoerotical troubles. On the other hand, Edo period was nothing but a slow and long decline process of male homosexuality which was vulgalized &amp; commercialized. Yet, even in Meiji period , pederasty was more popular than heterosexuality among students. And Ko-ha i.e. manly students engaged in pederasty , on the contrary Nan-pa i.e. soft students loved women, but the latter was despised as effeminate.Anyhow some readers may misunderstand as if in Japan male homosexuality became most vigorous in Tokugawa period. However I would like to point out that such a conception is not correct . I want to comment more, but night's candles are burnt out, so I mugt go to bed now. Anyway after ancient Greek , only Japanese could have enhanced male homosexuality to highly ethical valued SHUDO i.e. the way of male love. And I hope many people study Japanese culture, history &amp; literature more.	2000-01-20
