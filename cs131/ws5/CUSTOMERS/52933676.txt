Outstanding plot development that was well thought out and characters are not just one dimension.  This plot was complex and dealt with world politics but I never once felt that I couldn't gain an understanding of what was going on.  So often I read these types of novels and there is an implicit understanding that you know about conflict X in depth so they don't bother explaining anything. <br /> <br />The only loss of one star was that at the end it seemed a tad over the top in the fact that it was too detailed and technical given the rest of the tone of the book.  Ultimately, by this time, we the reader all want to now how this ends but yet we are subjected to detailed explanation of issues going on when the lead character \\"saves the day\\". <br /> <br />Keep up the good work Mr. Staeger.  I look forward to reading your next novel.	2005-09-29

The first 175 pages really were quick but then the descriptions of the different floors and layout of the hotel easily became lost.  I had no overall sense of any layout once they moved beyond the 2nd floor.  This definately detracted from the book since so much of the later part of the book really focuses on where the bad guy is in relation to the good guys.  Too bad.  That's why I think this will make a better movie -- but only if marketed as a thriller versus horror.	2005-09-28
US	52933676	R826FVYDMQ67N	0399152938	648470787	Marker	Books	1	6	9	N	N	Boring	Not quite sure how so many positive reviews came about for this book.  It took me about two weeks to slug through this snooze-fest! With the title called Marker anyone who couldn't figure out that the plot was going to be based on something found in genetics and that somehow insurance companies were going to turn around and use this against us must be asleep at the wheel.  How could anyone say this book had any suspense???  I could have easily read Robin Cooks commentary at the end to figure out the entire plot.  He basically wrote a 500 page cure for insomniacs. <br /> <br />Needless to say this is one author I have officially given up on.	2005-09-14

Impatient all the time even when she needs information from people she is still rude to them.  And if her character is supposed to be this close to all these people in her life (i.e., Ruby, Smart Cookie) she doesn't even feel good enough nor they with her, to open up about things going on in their personal life.  I'll keep reading but I hope China gets out of this funk she is in.  Perhpas that is why the other characters don't want to get into anything with her character because she has been so rude?  I don't think it started with this book -- I noticed it the last book as well -- just not as pronounced. <br /> <br />The mystery was okay -- predictable for me.  I would have been surprised if something different happened.	2005-08-04

I couldn't even make it 60+ pages into this book nor did I have any desire to go back and try again and again to figure out how the characters related, etc.  Coupled with the fact that I know nothing about this historical timeframe nor did the author immerse with this knowledge, I just figured \\"Why bother?\\".  I was a fan of his other books but I just found myself thinking that \\"This is too much work and for what payoff?\\"  Basically I would read the words but not be able to enjoy.

But the back story about how those images got there just wasn't very plausible.  I think he had a great concept but just didn't execute it very well.  I also think he introduced some good characters (Loren Muse especially!) that I hope to see again some time.  Good try but next time maybe take your time with the story line.

This book read more like a paranoid political mouthpiece than a thriller and I'm very disappointed that he thought his fans would think that was a great idea.  This \\"thriller\\" was so non-thrilling the only way the author could attempt to bring tension to the story was by blatently hiding facts from the reader (for example Justin would get on the phone with another character and instead of making the reader privy to the conversation we, the reader, get to read that Justin told the other character what he wanted -- not any details.  How bogus is that? <br /> <br />Because of the political overtones early in the story I could have written the end of the book about 1/4th of the way into it as well. <br /> <br />I hope this author returns to the original formula that won him so many fans.	2005-04-28

Yikes was this bad.  Poorly written and her characters border on the retarded. What could have been humorous turned out to be sad.  Too bad she didn't just stick to a book about the dating experiment.  I think I might have cracked a grin once during one of the dates.	2005-04-07

This book would have made a nice side note in the series but it's not really a mystery.  The whole premises seems stupid as to why he is even involved in this case in the 1st place.  I think if we wanted to investigate Cole's origins, it could have been done in a much better fashion -- say Last Detective style.  I guess I can't stop thinking at how long we've waited for this book and this is all the fans got?  It's not much of a mystery and Joe barely has any space in the book.  He really shouldn't of even been mentioned!  And is it just me or was Carol Starkey always that dumb and co-dependent?  Because she is really, really annoying in this book... hope that Robert Crais has fleshed out these characters demons and we can get back to a good mystery one of these days.	2005-04-02

And I can't imagine that anyone in this guys family wouldn't have tried to see what was wrong with him.  And are we supposed to believe that someone who is this dumb could actually come up with all the clever sayings?  And that he was able to act like this after a week of reading detective novels?

I found this section very engaging to read and the story totally drew me in. <br /> <br />Then disaster struck.  From section 2 of this book on there are assumptions made by the author that the reader understands the court of appeals process (I would think most people don't) as well as the Supreme Court.  If I read the word AEDPA (or whatever it was) one more time, I'm going to scream.  And, in the credits after the story, he further insults the reader by explaining how he had to dummy down the law so that the common lay person could understand.   <br /> <br />And finally this author's belief that judges care more about worrying if the law was followed over potentially putting to death in innocent man are extreme.  Or that Supreme Court judges would let someone potentially innocent die because they would rather be able to call in a chit for another case -- again EXTREME. <br /> <br />And just what was the purpose of having the president, Kilcannon, make an appearance? <br /> <br />It's too bad because this book started off so wonderful.  My suggestion is to read the first section and then skip to the end because nothing really happens in the last two sections except with the last page. <br /> <br />I'll continue to read this author with the hopes that it doesn't happen again.	2005-03-11

What a mistake.  The plot was just too out there to follow, the characters are poorly defined (i.e., the all \\"sound\\" the same so it's hard to determine who is speaking), and the drug use didn't seem to have any purpose at all.  Additionally, the book just didn't seem to flow well when read.  Too many thoughts left out perhaps.	2005-03-04

I think the author tried to do the job of presenting alternate theories of what could have happened to TWA flight 800 in an engaging matter but John just didn't seem to fit this investigation.  For example, why did he keep using his real name if he didn't want to be shut down?  And, like most, I could see how the events of 9/11 were going to play into the story at the end.  The author himself admits at the end of the book that he painted himself into a corner!

I think the last 60 pages actually focuses on what we used to love about Anita.  Now the only people that could actually choke down the first 600 pages have to be into porn.  And it's not even good porn!  Sorry Ms. Hamilton, you'll have to put your books in a different place in the store if you keep writing this way.

You don't find out until the very end of the book just what the supernatural portion of this book really is and by that time I didn't care.  So much of this book is confusing because it isn't explained up front.  The prose is choppy -- the references to characters and places are very old school.  Just an odd book that wasn't worth the time investment to read.	2004-10-06

Maybe if you've never read a Patricia Cornwell book this would seem exciting and new.<br /><br />While the book does have some interesting twists, you'll reflect upon it and realize that the plot is too contrived (i.e., would the lawyer have really given up the goods that easy if he was still involved?) and other plot \\"twists\\" I saw coming a mile away.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the character and the author, you won't be wasting your time.

I really enjoyed the outline of the story as laid out in the book jacket -- it had such potential!  But the writing needed editing AND the lead character was so inconsistent I don't think I could keep track!  Also, at the very end (no spoiler since this will be vague), I was quite upset that the priest was more upset about this brothers actions than those of children!  Disgusting!

I'm suprised no one seemed to mention this but why are there long paragraphs of descriptions that have nothing to do with nothing such as what kind of shingles are on buildings?  Very distracting to the story!<br />I agree with the other reviewers as well -- the ending was anti-climatic to say the least but I'm grateful that it spared me from learning ALL the useless details such as perhaps what kind of shoes someone was wearing when the take down occurred.<br />The characters are so undeveloped it's not even funny but perhaps I'd know them better if I didn't jump in mid-way through the series.  For some reason, chief Kerney seems to me to be in his early 50's and he's having a kid with someone who sounds to be a kid herself (just graduating West Point?) -- that's odd.  The guy has grandchildren and his own baby on the way?  Ewee!<br />Won't be lining up to read this author anytime soon unless I need a good sleeping aid.

Since these aren't series books, I'd skip this one unless you are a fan of the &quot;ouch that hurts... let's do that again club&quot;.  The whole premise is stupid since the main character has a family and friends that should have believed her in the 1st place.  And it just keeps going and going and going and going.

And, at first, what I thought would be great character interaction turned out to be just very shallow dialogue that instead of being witty turned into being forced just for the sake of a giggle.  Near the 1/2 way point, the plot began to get so complex in ancient times, I couldn't keep the characters straight, even with the list at the front of the book.  The author didn't give these characters enough life except in name to make them stand out.  It also seemed that you needed to have some knowledge of Marlowe and the spy network at the time in order to fully understand what happened.  And I still don't think I understand WHY, in modern times, the book was causing such a stir.  Oh, and don't forget a major plot twist thrown in at the end that you'll never guess because the author leaves out a HUGE part of information that the lead character knew about but never told us, the reader.  Also, too many other ends left undone at the end.  Probably because we will get a sequel with these characters?  Well, this reader for one won't be on that train.	2004-06-10

While the book had an interesting plot where the heck was the editor?  At some point chapters would almost repeat verbatin paragraphs from other chapters.

Boy, what a surprise that it was just OK.  I enjoyed the fact that about 1/3rd of the way into the book you are allowed to see inside the bad guy's head as well.  However, this writer feels that in order to create suspense, she has to keep blantant secrets from the reader.  You know... that part in the dialogue where two people are talking about the plan and then instead of having the author disclose the PLAN to the reader instead they write &quot;...and then I told her the rest of the plan.&quot;  So now you are stuck reading 40 pages to read how the plan rolls out.  Besides this pet peeve of mine, the writer, IMHO, didn't bring me enough into the time period.  For example, the religious frenzy these nuns work themselves into didn't seem at all appropriate based on the information we are provided.  And how about a 12 year old leader of this church?  Maybe that was common but it stank to me.  More historical background about the politics would have probably been more helpful as well. <br />Well, I took a risk on a new author and it didn't pay off.	2004-03-11

While certainly not her finest, I'm surprised at the feedback this book has drawn so far.  Any fan of the series should know her days of forensic medicine in the books are over.  Kay isn't even a medical examiner anymore so what did you people really expect?<br />In fact, I think this book took a turn for the better in the fact that the characters were not all about to commit suicide because they were so miserable.  Things are actually looking up for these characters and, I assume, we might be able to get back at some point in the series, to other murders besides this particular serial killer.<br />Did it have some loose ends?  Sure!  But I think a lot of things will get wrapped up for us in the next book.  We've stuck with these characters for how long now?  I think we know things will become more clear with future books.  I'm just glad her characters are out of their ruts and, it seems, she will keep most of them out of there as she explains to us why they have all been cranky for several books now.<br />Not the best offering to the series, but not the worse either.	2003-12-31

After reading Voice of the Blood I thought I might have found another vampire series that would really hold my attention.  But instead of killing off a vampire series like Anne Rice did about book four, Jemiah Jefferson managed to screw it up after one book.  The characters go no where after Daniel has a conflict with one he made.  The new girl Daniel is in love with is a weirdo and not in a good way either.  Just a stupid weirdo.  Too bad.	2003-10-17

In this one, she keeps the plot moving along at excellent rate but also takes time to work the atmosphere of a wintery Boston into the text.  While some unreal coincidences occur between the characters to make the plot gel correctly, it's not enought to distract too much.  I enjoyed reading the interaction between the characters even if it was too coincidental. I look forward to more books with these characters in the near future.	2003-08-29

I was so happy because I enjoyed all the previous books by this author.  However, after about 30 pages I just could not get into it.  When the book was officially published, my friend had purchased a copy and I agreed to try again.  Boy, was I glad I did!  I believe that my first attempt at reading the book seemed so fresh to current 9/11 headlines that I just couldn't bring myself to read it.<br />Kyle Mills has created an intricate tale about events that are occuring in our government after the events of 9/11.  He also introduces some nasty yet likable characters that are working with our government but are outside our jurisdiction.<br />If you find yourself getting lost in the characters early on, keep reading and reminding yourself who the players are.  You'll be glad you made the extra effort because Kyle sure has opened my eyes as to events that might be occuring in our government right now.	2002-10-15

The family history was confusing especially when the author kept referring to them differently -- one sentence a character might be referred to as Great-Great grandfather and the next it would be Leatha's grandfather.  Also, I was confused as to a character that had a different name than what was on the family tree so I had no clue what was going on -- I did go back and re-read portions after I had read an except of a diary entry and the light went on but reading 120 pages for a light to blink... well, 'nuff said.<BR>Once I figured out who the characters all were, the plot was so obvious it hurt and to have to read China being braindead with her questions to figure out the truth was less than thrilling.<BR>Had I not had the prior history of this series, I would have never made it through this book.<BR>Let's hope the next one get's back to the roots of China (and McQuaid).	2001-11-27

While definately not her best, I think it's a wonderful attempt for her to get away from the Kay Scarpetta series.  I think the more recent Kay book are depressing to read and I can't imagine how depressing they would be to write, so her attempt at humor is refreshing.  Is this book perfect?  No.  Is this book a literary masterpiece?  No.  What I did find pleasing when reading this book is the historical information and the humor she can make -- which means she really understands her research.  That is something I can appreciate and look forward to more books like this -- give Kay a rest.	2001-11-14

Boy, was this one a let down.  Absolutey no suspense and the characters act so moronic!<br />He really could have done something with this book because he's right in the fact that the mailman and communications really make an impact on everyones life but he left a lot of questions unanswered, like what kind of creature would do something like this?<br />And when the story was told from the child's point of view it was like reading from a very educated adults point of view -- very lame.<br />I'm not done with this author yet though.

I read the 1st book when it was first published and LOVED it then again right before I read this one (and still LOVED it).  But  then when I was reading this book I feel a lot of the parts were exact  repeats of the first!  In some places I could almost point to places where  cut and paste must have occurred between the two books!<br />While I did enjoy  the ending, this book was bogged down with so many repeats of the 1st that  I feel I should have read one or the other and been satisfied.	2000-07-28

The fact  that the killer is after the main chacacter seems to be a sidebar rather  than the mainline.<br />Also, at times, the characterization seems to be  inconsistent.  Sometimes the main character is cracking jokes in his head  which you get to read but then in similar situations he's all business with  the same people -- this made it difficult for me to identify with the  characters when they seemed to have different personality traits with each  chapter.  It might come down to the fact that the author is trying to throw  a little sardonic humor in but some of the other areas are being edited  out?<br />I'll try one more older novel (I picked up a lot of his works at  garage sales) but if it's like this one, they are all going.	2000-06-02

However, this book stands on  it's own even still.<br />I was also disappointed that the relationship  between Jack and Gia wasn't explored as in the first book -- Jack is more  of the &quot;fix it&quot; man in this book against nasty characters of the  Arab world.<br />The book is good -- not just as good as the first one.  I  think the author spent too much time away from the characters and this book  didn't come off as intimate with the characters as the first.<br />I plan to  read the reveiws of the 3rd and see if it's more like the first and if so,  will continue on in the series.	2000-05-31

While the premise could have been interesting -- tying back ancient history to a madman's quest for knowledge -- this author writes information about  history dryer than most history text books that I had to read in college.  <br />Another annoying thing this author does is repeat sections of the book  verbatim from chapter to chapter -- bad editing job or how the author  really writes?<br />I'm giving the book two stars because I think it had the  potential to been something really neat had he let the story come out  instead of burying it in with so many facts of history.  He could also do a  lot with character development if he gave it the same passion as he does  with his history research.	2000-05-14

I only gave it a 2 instead of a one because I think someone  like Michael Palmer or one of the other medical mystery writers could spin  out an interesting story related to the title.<br />The writing style was also  very choppy.

While we do know what is going to happen to some of  the characters before they know, he does a wonderful job of making us  anxious for the characters without thinking they (the characters) are  stupid for not seeing it sooner.<br />A twist at the end just added to the  overall readability of the book.  <br />Great work Mr. Craven!	2000-02-01

A little less descriptions of how to get to point A to point B would be helpful OR spice up the directions a bit.

Story pick's up about half-way through for about 70 pages or so, and then down hill again.  You  are left with the feeling, who cares and what did all this mean?

This book has way to many near death and saved at the last minute scenes to be believable.  I was pleading  to the author about halfway through to put them out of their misery!<br />I  like the overall story line but in the hands of a more talented author this  book could have really become something. For instance, character  interactions more developed, scenery described for a reader, not someone  who would be watching TV, etc.  This book, as it reads, is a movie script  -- nothing more.	1999-11-30

I was browsing through the mystery section at the book store and stumbled across this (obviously this  book was in the wrong place).  The back made is sound good, so I decided to  read a few pages -- I was hooked!  One of the serial killers describes a  young man he picked up who had a tatoo across his neck that said &quot;Cut  Here&quot; so the serial killer merely had to follow the directions! (this  is on the 2nd page!)<br />The book is extremely gory -- for those of you who  have a weak stomach you might want to pass on this one.<br />AIDS is a theme  throughout the book.  I found myself thinking how true some of her points  were about the amount of research being done to find a cure and the  extremes some people might feel like going to so that a cure could be  focused on.<br />This is the best book I have read by this author -- and  ranked in my top books I have read.  This book is a must read for anyone  who is into horror -- but it might spoil you for others...	1999-11-15

While this book is classified a mystery, it's more about life in an office setting and the lead characters view about her co-workers.  I wish I could say some of the things she does to her boss!<br />The mystery does seem a  little over complicated at times but it was refreshing to see the mystery  unfold by someone who wasn't totally into the murder investigation and  didn't have all this insider information.

This  book was nicely weaved together and the plot didn't seem forced.  You could  truely understand why someone would want to kill the guy who got killed.

Kay takes a new lover to bed but are we really supposed to believe that one  night of sex justifies &quot;Don't fall in love with me&quot;?  Come on.

Extremely explosive start and keeps on going.  The last part of the book reminded me a lot of The Firm but I don't know if it was because of the setting (down  south) or not.  While probably classified as a political thriller, it's not  typical for that category -- no grand scheme cross country intrigue.  Just  good ole suspense at it's very best.  I'm passing this book around to my  friends now -- I know it will make it's way to many people in a short time  because once you start you can't put it down.

This is a FALSE statement.  While you might learn about the  characters, you learn about them through others perceptions (which change  from person to person)and not what goes on in their heads -- and since the  characters are so busy lying when they talk, you never really know what the  truth is.  The only character we find out through his own thoughts would be  from the likable/hatable local PC but I still don't feel like I knew him at  all.  <br />She keeps changing the person describing the story, but it's  mostly from the police side.  Since she starts the book from the victim's  last thoughts and the killers thoughts about the daughter, I had hoped to  be brought back into their thoughts as the story progresses (and how the  review indicates).<br />This book reads more like a police procedural. Since  many of her readers have come to expect the introspective viewpoints of her  characters for filling in the blanks about their personalities, this book  will leave many unfullfilled.<br />I know in &quot;real life&quot; no story is  never really tidy -- that may be her excuse for leaving so many things  undiscussed.  Yet, when you mention them on the inside of the book cover to  get you hooked, you need to provide more of a sinister explanation.  Like  the part about &quot;and why does the daughter scream everytime her father  picks her up?&quot;  Don't get excited -- the explanation has nothing to do  with the plot.<br />If you like police procedurals, give this a try from your  library.  If you are looking for the same type of style from her, don't  bother.	1999-07-09

Is a tad bit dry and loses the supsense because the book starts out in current time and the rest is  flashbacks until the end.

Her descriptions of the 14th century are good -- I  can't comment on the validity of them but they sounded plausible to me.  As  for the germs in the 21st century, I cannot comment on the validity of that  either, but they do sound a little far fetched.  &lt;/p&gt; If you are  looking for a captivating read -- not a suspense, edge of your seat  thriller -- try this out for a change of pace.

And what a  name &quot;Butt Fluck&quot; -- had me laughing out loud!<br />It's sad to see  so many people bash a non-series book -- maybe they are afraid that she  won't bring back the Scarpetta series if her non-series books are not well  received?

Again, this wasn't his best but worth the time to  read.  The characters are more developed and you can see huge potential for  more in the future.<br />The one annoying thing this author did was to have  the characters all figure out who the demon is but don't tell the reader.   While I was pretty sure who it was, I felt stupid.  The author writes  things like &quot;and then I figured out who did it.  So I told him who  did&quot;.  Next Chapter!<br />Nevertheless, this was a great read.  In the  next book I'd like to see Nest gain more insight into her magic and a  teaming up of her and John to fight more than just a demon -- introduce a  few more Word characters.<br />Hurry up Terry -- your fans are waiting!	1998-08-26

The homeless ARE overlooked in our society.  But if  Mr. Grisham wants us to believe that this homeless man who ends up getting  shot when he takes a group of lawyers hostage makes a big enough impression  for one lawyer to throw away a coming partnership and work for $30K a year  to help them, he needed to develop the character much more.  Not just  decide he needs to help the poor.<br />If this lawyer really wants to help the  poor and senses that the law firm he works at is somehow involved, why  didn't he stay on and help from within?  Going after the law firm was lame  -- it really is one lawyer in the firm that's the bad apple.  And there is  really no suspense -- we just read about how a lawyer decides to help the  poor after a traumatic experience.<br />While this new lawyer for the poor is  going around taking cases from the poor, it reads just like &quot;The  Rainmaker&quot;.  Did you take paragraphs from one manuscript and cut and  paste them into this one?<br />And why the extra effor to find Hector?  Why  not just go to the post office to get a forwarding address OR mail him  something that tells the post office they need to be informed of a  forwarding address?  I'll tell you why -- he needs to add more pages to the  book that do nothing to develop the character -- except to make the lawyer  look stupid.<br />And if he's so dedicated to the poor, why is he spending so  much time taking cases instead of clearing them?<br />Who really benefitted  from the settlement?<br />If Mr. Grisham really does care for the poor, did he  donate any of the proceeds of this book to them?  Why didn't he include a  page at the back informing his readers of how to contact area shelters so  that people could pitch in?<br />Oh well -- maybe the next one will be better.   I heard a rumor that Mr. Grisham wasn't going to sell the movie rights to  his books until after it came outin paperback because so many people were  just waiting for the movie.  Maybe he wrote this book to discourage those  movie people from even wanting to buy the rights ever again?	1998-08-23

He is a former Los Angelos  police office who worked in the computer division but left, making sure to  erase himself in many computer databases.<br />He meets a woman in a bar (the  waitress) and becomes curious when she doesn't show up for work the next  day.  He goes to her house (because he followed her home from work the  previous evening unknown to her) and let's himself in.  The place is  cleared out and a picture of a cockroach is nailed to the wall.  While  looking around, a SWAT team enters the home and he barely escapes.  Finding  nothing in the paper that would explain why they were at her house, he  decides to investigate her himself.<br />Suspense is good but as the plot  reveals itself it becomes way to complex.  The middle and ending of the  book read more like a movie script.  <br />I'm not into government coverups,  etc. so this didn't turn out to be my cup of tea but I did like his writing  style in this book.  Each time Spencer had a flashback about his past he  revealed a little more about himself and why he is so tormented.  Works  real well by itself -- he didn't need to through in the government and tie  it all up in a bundle.	1998-08-13

She works for a real estate firm showing high priced condo's, etc.  One woman calls to put her dead daughter's condo up for sale but she is having a hard time of it since she really doesn't believe her daughter's death was an accident...Come on Mary! Don't insult us readers! Might be good if you didn't ask your readers to buy into everything making it so forced...  And the ending -- how Lacey figured everything out was just as forced.<br />And the romance in the book -- Lacey finds a guy she is interested in while in the witness protection program but decides that after one date she just can't lie (or at least not be open about her past) but yet he decides to still pursue her and pursue her (after only 1 date) --reads more like stalking than romance!	1998-08-11

This time, while babysitting a cat for another actor, she has to take the cat to a shrink because of it's naughty behaviour.

The way the hospital staff was acting you definately didn't think who was behind it all -- maybe if he provided some kind of explanation of why people responded the way they did it would be more plausible.  For example, how did the culprits know that the hospital staff was on to them and order them killed?<br />The books provides a plausible thing happening -- some wacko giving people weird diseases that you can order by mail with a credit card -- but the ending was lame to say the least.	1998-05-02

New murders have the same MO of his father who &quot;rode the lightning&quot; 20 years ago.  A writer who wrote about his father gets involved in these new murders and finds that the person who discovered one of the bodies is the serial killer's son.  When the police find out the link, he's on the lamb.<br />While the killer's reasoning is a little off (to me anyway), Alan Russell's writing is face paced and he provides a good twist at the end.<br />Well worth the read, but his other book, Multiple Wounds is more expertly written and researched.	1998-05-02

Maybe I missed something, but this book is about saving his estranged son.<br />  While Billy Bob's reflection into the past shows insight into his character, the plot is convoluted and found myself at the end wondering how he ever figured out who did it.  Of course it's one of those novels where key information is with held until the end but Billy Bob knew it all along.<br />  I think I'll pass on the next one.	1997-11-19

New readers and fans of Deborah Crombie will not be disappointed with her fifth installment of the Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James detective team from Scotland Yard.  <br />  When Duncan receives a call from his ex-wife, Vic, after a twelve year separation, it can only be trouble.  Vic, recently abandoned by her husband for a younger model, is writing a biography about a semi-popular poet, Lydia Brooke.  During the course of Vic's investigation for her book, she comes across some disturbing evidence that the poet may not have taken her own life five years ago and seeks out Duncan's professional connections for more details. <br />  Duncan decides to help Vic, much to the distress of Gemma, Duncan's partner both professionally and personally.  Duncan assures Gemma he plans on only obtaining a copy of the police report, but once Vic turns up dead Duncan decides to take a leave of absence to further investigate.  Gemma stands by her man and they set out to find her murderer.  They conclude that the key to finding her murderer is to determine who didn't want her to continue her exploration of Lydia Brooke's death.<br />  As with some author's who keep the reader in the dark about key pieces of information as a means to disguise their inability to write skillfully, Deborah Crombie unveils the facts to the reader as Duncan and Gemma learn them.  This skillful writer intersperses letters written by Lydia to her mother as well as private conversations that take place outside of Duncan and Gemma's ears and still pulls off &quot;I can't believe that's who did it&quot; at the end.<br />  Deborah Crombie's books are categorized as police procedurals, but within each successive book in the series she adds a dimension to the growing relationship between Duncan and Gemma.  While finding Vic's murderer (as well as the murderer of Lydia Brooke) brings closure for Duncan, what Vic leaves behind will change Duncan and Gemma's personal relationship forever.<br />  I hope Ms. Crombie doesn't take too long to finish her next installment as readers will be anxiously awaiting to see how Vic's legacy will impact Duncan and Gemma.<br />	1997-11-19
US	52933676	R1K1VMJRTZT6OX	0312155654	977176455	The Lazarus Hotel	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Locked Hotel Floor Mystery	This was the first book I read by Jo Bannister and probably the last. Before I explain why, I first have to give credit to Jo Bannister for her tight writing style and the ability to move the action along without long descriptions of the surroundings (as some authors seem prone to do today just to add extra pages to their book).<br />  A father, upset about his daughter's suicide, decides that by bringing together people he feels responsible for her suicide will somehow heal his pain. <br />  The father convinces a family friend and psychologist to hold a &quot;Personal Discovery&quot; retreat as a means to getting these people together so that he can show them just how much they let his daughter down. This is where the author lets her readers down.<br />  Amazingly these people all show up through a variety of schemes, with none of them being believable.<br />  Richard Speke, a journalist who tried to save the young woman when he sees her car go off a bridge into the river, was sent to the Personal Discovery weekend per the request of his TV station when they discovered he could no longer perform his job duties of overseas reporting now that he feels responsible for letting the young woman die.<br />  Will Furney, the young woman's ex-fiance, won his invitation in a competition, even though he can't remember entering any such competition.<br />  Sheelagh Cody, the young woman's schoolgirl friend, was sent per an invitation from a client when they claimed she showed an interest in that client's recent Personal Discovery weekend.<br />  Tariq Straker, the young woman's agent, decided to attend based on a recommendation from a friend who found a course like this fascinating.<br />  Tessa McNaught, a doctor, was requested to join the group to write about her assessment of this kind of weekend therapy, but it eventually turns out that she was the young girls doctor and lover.<br />  Larry Ford, a washed-up tennis pro turned coach for the young woman, was sent to the retreat per the request of his current employer who felt he needed to learn some tact.<br />  Joe Lockhead, aka the young woman's father, also appears as part of the group.<br />  If you can look beyond how the author gets all these people to show up, there is still the problem of how they don't recognize each other or at least some of them. The young woman's coach, agent, and long time friend should have recognized the young woman's father immediately. Also, if the young woman's father felt these people were responsible for her suicide, shouldn't they have recognized each other from the funeral? <br />  Eventually, they all discover that they all had some unresolved guilt in the suicide of the same young woman. When Larry tries to leave, the group discovers that the power has been turned off to the elevator for the weekend and they are locked in. That night, the pychologist winds up with her head bashed in by a rolling pin. <br />  Thrown in as a red herring is a young boy living in the not quite finished hotel who makes his way around through the elevator shaft.<br />  The discovery of who is actually behind the attempted murder of the phychologist as well as other attempted murders during their confined stay is written with great skill and suspense but was overshadowed, at least for me, by the contrieved way they are all brought together.	1997-11-18

Two rednecks, Chub &amp; Bode, also had a winning ticket but decided they shouldn't have to share.  They beat her up and steal her ticket and the rest of the book is JoLayne trying to get it back.<br /> While the story plot is good, the characters are not too believable.  For instance, Chub &amp; Bode are smart enough to find JoLayne and cover up some of the evidence that she won (getting a store clerk to trade the video surveillance tape with a blank one) however they are not smart enough to stop using her credit card, thereby allowing JoLayne and her new found reporter from tracing them.  Additionally, the Hooters waitress that was kidnapped by the video store clerk for Chub went along a little too willingly.  No fight, no nothing.  While the book has some funny parts (that's Major Chub to you), there are better books by Carl Haissen to read that have good strong characters (Strip Tease, Double Whammy) that leave you saying &quot;This one reminds me of...&quot;	1997-11-13

I think they missed thier calling and should take it on the road instead of hanging out in Texas working bad jobs and getting chased by porno film makers.

However after the 3rd book, I could no longer find interest in the characters who became too far removed from the original cast.  I also found great interest in reading his books since he lived in a neighbouring town, Barrington, IL.  Although he has moved out of the area (I think Hawaii), he returns to this area, Starlight, IL (which seems to be somewhere around the Northeastern area in Illinois).<br />  The lead character in this book is a 14-year old girl named Nest Freemark.  While I found the other chacters believable and real, Nest seems too immature to be believable (not because she's a she but because she is too young).  I would have liked to see Nest get some more clues from her grandmother, especially since she knew what Nest was up against.  With her little gang of friends as helpers, I couldn't stop myself from thinking of the new Scoby Do cartoon where all the characters are younger but doing the same thing the older characters do with the same success.  I hope to read about a sequel in the near future where Nest has grown up and again has to deal with the forces of Evil  -- maybe she finds a diary kept by her grandmother that will explain more to her...<br />    Terry needs to break out of the funk he seemed to get himself in after beating the Shannara series to death and focus on this series that shows alot of potential.<br />    Read this book if a sequel is planned -- I'm sure he's got more in store for these characters and we won't be disappointed.	1997-11-11

The text reads more like a medical book than a novel, although after the first 150 pages it seems to read better (or maybe I just got used to it).  The only thing that kept me reading was the rave reviews it was getting.  I'd like to see more of her work in the future as she does show promise, but let's hope she can develop her character more and add a bigger twist.

Anne Rice, like many authors, does't want to give up on a good idea and runs the series into the ground like she did with her Vampire series. In this books, she develops a new character who has a new demon.  <br />  I found the first 50 pages hard to get though since you didn't really know what was happening, but once you met her personal demon, Stephan, she again falls into her writing style that pulls you into another world where you don't want to go back.<br />    Unforntunately, she does go back into the present where she should have stayed in the past.  The ending was not believable as she gives back to the demon the one thing that kept him to her without it being a trick.  Maybe if she would have lost her new found talent, I would have found myself wanting a sequel. <br />    If you are intested in reading a work that shows the author's time in the investigation of music and being drawn into another world, if only for a short time, rent it from your local library.  If you want to be drawn into another world and stay there, read The Witching Hour.	1997-11-11
