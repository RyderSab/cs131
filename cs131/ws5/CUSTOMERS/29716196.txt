I picked this book up the other day at our local bookstore and was told by the two pushy sales clerk that I had to read it.  Okay.. well my sister's name is Caroline is I thought it was funny they played on her name.  So I started reading it last night and couldn't put it down.  2hrs later, I was done and was like wow.  The book is very well written and I look forward to reading more by the same author.  The illustrations had a whole Tim Burton thing going on, even though it wasn't him, still felt like it.  Very Good.  For the mature child.	2003-08-10

I finished the first of the set in 30 minutes and had to get started on the second right away.  I liked how the authors let the story pick up right away, like you never left the scene of all the problems.  This one was very good, as you can only see the little creatures after a weird looking fairie spits in your eye, or using a particular stone with glass in it.  I loved how the children where quick thinkers and dragged the goblins to there doom in the stream.  I finished this book in about the same time as the one before.  I am positively on pins and needles waiting for the next book.  I hope two more come out at the same time.  Does anyone know how many are gonna be in this set??	2003-07-19

I picked these up from our local bookstore in our mall yesturday and I knew I had to have them.  The minute I got home from running my errands and all, I went straight to reading.  Of course I start with the first so I know whats going on.  The authors do a great job with the childrens background and their paranoid mother. These are definatly a page turner and with 106 pages per a book (so far), I finished reading them in about 30-35 minutes.  The drawings are especially cute.  My favorite part was when Mallory put another hole into their kitchen wall to find that \\"squirrel\\" they have been looking for.  Pulling out all those weird things and then finding the dumbwaiter amd riding it up and up and up.  This story is great for kids... its not too long to make them disinterested and adults would love it too.  Move over Harry Potter , these get my vote.	2003-07-19

I will never forget that day.  I was just getting up and flipped on the TV and set the channel to NBC (Today Show), to see what was going on in the world.  They had just come back from commercial's and there LIVE on TV was a live shot from a helicopter high above the NY skyline in the morning, showing the whole world a tall building, with billowing smoke coming out of it.  I remember she reported that they believed a small commuter plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers at the WTC.  I remember saying to myself &quot;Bummer&quot;.  Then after about 8-10 minutes I was on the phone with my boyfriend telling him he was missing a great call in NYC, but we lived in New Jersey. <BR>(He is Firechief here in our town.)  He was on his way home to see what was going on and after I hung up with him, I turned my attention back to the TV right to see a live shot from one of the helicopters the second plane to hit the other Tower.  I knew something was wrong.  The whole day we watched and just couldnt believe what was going on.  As the months went on and we began to pick up the pieces, I was shopping at our local Target and came across this book that had just came out.  I grabbed it with out even looking at the price and knew I had to have it.  I am a history junkie and would love to have a copy for future memories and to share with family and friends.  I was not disappointed with this book, the DVD was alittle off and drifted from the main plot, but I will still always remember where I was when I heard the news. Like people say they remember where they were when they heard about JFK being shot, the Shuttle exploding (both times), Princess Diana's death and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Great book to have around for reference and to share the stories with if you have small children who wouldnt remember that day.	2003-07-18

The only fun parts where when she was with Nick and not being a wedding planner, I feel the author waited too long to bring in the story line at the begining of the book.  It dragged in some spots and then the ending was the real treat.  Such a messed up family she has to deal with, left alone the one she lives with now (her own). Read it if your getting married, or a wedding planner for a laugh, but if your looking for a serious book gto settle down with, I'm afraid I would pass on this one.	2003-07-13
