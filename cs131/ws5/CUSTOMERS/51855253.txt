US	51855253	R87UN2HEMZAHH	0671027387	315416156	Deception Point	Books	3	0	0	N	N	An average thriller....	With the popularity of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, I'm sure that alot of readers like me are looking for other works by this popular author.  Deception Point is one of his earlier works and features the fast pace, non stop action that he is becoming known for.<br />  In Deception Point, intelligence agent Rachel Sexon is the daughter of presidential candidate Senator Sexton.  He opposes big government spending and one of the features of his campaign is to stop waste spending, esp NASA.  The sitting president summons Rachel to verify an extraordinary find in the Artic Sea--a metorite with proof of extra-terrestial life form..found by NASA.<br />  Rachel and other civilian experts soon find out that the meteorite is a hoax. This discovery puts their lives in danger as an elite military team targets them to destroy them and proof of the deception.  TV scientist Michael Talland joins Rachel to help find out the truth.  But they are unsure of who to trust in the government and who is behind the conspiracy.<br />  The plot of fast paced and exciting with lots of action and suspenseful twists.  It keeps the reader engaged in the story.  As with all his other novels, there is a lack of character development that limits this novel and prevents it from giving it 5 stars.  But for fans of a fast moving thriller- this book won't disappoint.	2004-05-25
US	51855253	R1WRQVX8R8TCYE	0373285043	626445845	With Open Arms: Song Of The West\Her Mother's Keeper (Silhouette Single Title)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	For fans only..	I am sure that Nora Roberts fans will enjoy this collection of her earlier works..both storys have been previously published in the early 1980's but show the promise that Nora Roberts has as a write.<br /><br />  The first story is &quot;Song of the West&quot;--Samantha is staying in Wyoming to care for her pregnant twin sister Sabrina.  During her stay on Sabrina's ranch, she meets next door rancher Jake Tanner.  Samantha is attracted to the Wyoming area, the horses and the ranch, but especially to Jake.  But she holds back, because she believes that Jake is a womanizer and already almost engaged to a local girl.  Samantha is written very well and likable, but Jake comes across as somewhat a male chauvenist--its hard to root for them as a couple.<br />  The second story is &quot;Her mother's Keeper&quot;.  Gwen comes home to Louisiana to save her mother from her newest houseguest, author Luke Powers.  Gwen mistakenly thinks that her mother and Luke are involved and is determined to get Luke our of her mother's life.  Poor Gwen is instantly attracted to Luke and confused about her feels for him and her disloyalty to her mother.  This book is much more interesting due to the relationships between the two women, Luke and Gwen and even Luke and Anabel (Gwen's mother).  Its easy to understand why Gwen has a hard time seeing her mother as a person.<br />  All in all, I am glad that I read this book.  It gives us a glimpse of the potential that Nora Roberts had as a writer, even in her early works.  She is at her best in defining relationships--and that shows in these storys.	2004-05-14

Jd Robb's 9th entry in her &quot;Death&quot; series has Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke receiving threatening letters from a terrorist group.  Each letter brings about a public threat/bomb that threatens civilians, property and the city.<br />  Like all the &quot;Death&quot; novels, the mystery and relationship between Eve and her husband are effectively blended.  There is also a subplot involving Eve's police partner, Peabody and her brother.  The main plot of the terrrorist threats and the subplot advance and blend seamlessly--until the end where they are eventually connected and intertwined.  Its nice to get some background on Peabody and her life--each book in the series gives us more and more information on the secondary characters.<br />  In the wake of 9/11, I found that the plot of the book hit all too close to home, as New York was again targeted by terrorists.  It was almost painful to read about the bombs and chilling when they go off and harm innocent civilians.  Loyalty in Death is definately one of the better novels in this series.	2004-04-24

Nora roberts is a prolific writer of romance,mystery/suspense novels- many o f her earlier works are being re-released into brand new collections.  Suspicious is one of these collections--it contains 3 of her earlier novels: Partners, Art of Deception and Night Moves.<br />1.  In partners, fellow reports Laurel and Matt are working together (reluctantly) to solve a high society murder.  Laurel has famiy ties to the victim's family and was once infatuated with the prime suspect.  Matt tries to be objective, but his feelings for Laurel color his judgement.  Laurel and Matt try to work thru their feelings for each other as well as solve the mystery in time to prevent other murders.<br />2.  In art of Deception, Painter Adam has come to stay with sculptor Kirby and her eccentric father.  But Adam has not come only as a friend, he has come to investigate forged art pieces.  Art of Deception shows Nora Robert's great flare for characterization- Kirby is unique and eccentric with a refreshing outlook in life.  Her fathers, servants and even pets, are equally fascinating and amusing.  Adam, like the readers, becomes entranced with them and their world, but his secrets may come between him and Kirby.  The identity of the villain is surprising.<br />3.  Night Moves is about composer, Maggie who has moved into the wilderness.  She hires landscaper Cliff and they soon find an old skeleton in her property.  They also find out long buried secrets that are decades old.  Despite this, maggie finds herself in danger.<br />All 3 novels are romantic mysteries with each couple vastly different from the other.  Even early on, Nora Roberts shows great promise as she effectively combines romance, mystery, suspense and humor.  For Nora Roberts fans, Suspicious is one of her better collections.	2004-04-24

This is another installment in the Bad Boys Series which is one of my favorites.  The 3 stories in this book are:<br />1.  Bringing up Baby by Lori Foster.  Gil Watson suddenly finds out that he is the father of a 2-year old daughter.  One whose mother, Gil's ex girlfriend, is dead and she is being raised by acting mother/caretaker, Anabel.  Gil has always been attracted to Anabel despite her wild and unique personality and the fact that she was his ex girlfriends best friend.  But now, Anabel has a deal for Gil- marry her and he can become a part of his daughters life.  Anabel wants Gil and is determined to show him how their life can be together.<br />2.  The Wilde One by Janelle Dennison.  Chayse wants Adrian Wilde to pose for her charity calendar, but Adrian is adament against it.  He makes a deal with her ...he'll let her take the pictures at his secluded mountain cabin.  Chayse agrees and they embark on a hot relationship, but she chayse has her doubts and runs away.<br />3.  Going After Adam by Nancy Warren.  Gretchen is a private investigator who has no trouble tracking down adulterous husbands for her clients.  She mistakenly finds Adam and soon she and Adam are running from hitmen who want him dead.  Their adventures have them posing as a couple on their way to Vegas, and they quickly find that their partnership has a lot of chemistry.<br />These stories are good, but Lori Foster's is the best--- she is adept at writing for this genre and the Bad Boys series.  Janelle Dennison's story is a great addition to the Wilde brothers- you can easily image Adrian brother's and their own storys.	2004-04-18

They feature the best authors and the hottest stories and this one is no exception.<br />1.  Meltdown by Shannon Mckenna is about headhunter Jane Duvall.  She pretends to be a magazine writer to infiltrate a hotel and possibly steal away one of their executives.  During her masquerade, she meets CEO Mac McNamara and they have instant chemistry that ignites during her tour of the hotel's penthouse.  But Mac knows that she is lying and given his own history with women, Mac doesn't know if he can trust her.<br />2.  Exposed by Donna Kauffman is about Delilah Hudson who is stranded on a train with Austin.  Luckily, they are both photographers and have more than that in common.  Soon Delilah and Austin are happily ensconced in his private sleeping car.  Austin knows that Delilah is someone special and wants to keep her with him, even after the train starts up.<br />3.  Pure Ginger is by EC Sheedy.  Ginger is the head of a publicity business and she is all business.  Due to some past relationship mistakes, she has sworn off men and has reinvented herself to be a plain, serious businesswoman.  But Cal Beaumann is considering hiring her to promote his business and wants a more sexy image and knows that Ginger is just the women for him.<br />All three books were good stories with great couples.  Shannon Mckenna's story was by far the best one..it had more likeable characters and they had more chemistry.  Bad boys Next Exit wasn't as good as the previous books in this series, but a solid effort for fans of the Bad Boys books.	2004-04-04

I love this book..It has great information on organizing your closet, updating and refining your wardrobe, and making your closet filled with &quot;ready to wear&quot; outfits and separates.<br />  It was written by a professional wardrobe consultant and stylist.  The great thing is that her tips can be tailored to each individual..be she a professional working women, stay at home mom or combination of the two.<br /><br />  Her chapters on closet organization were the best..its easy to see how your closet can get crammed and filled with seldom used things..like your prom dresses, wedding dress, off season coats etc.  She is correct when she says that you use only 20% of your wardrobe..and motivates you to get rid of the 80% that is cluttering your closet.  It made me want to revamp my whole closet!!<br />  Less helpful, were the chapters dealing with styling for your figure type.  But that is hard to do in written form for most women.  We need concrete examples...its better to just go to the store and try on bunches of stuff and see what works for your body shape.<br />  Also included in the book were worksheets and lists to help you write down your style and things you need.  I didn't find these very useful but i certainly appreciate the idea.  All in all, I found this book to be very helpful..i have already culled out many clothes in my wardrobe that don't work for me and I appreciate having extra space in my closet.  Plus, I look forward to shopping trips where i can be more selective of what i choose.  Great book!!	2004-04-04

Glorious Appearing is the 12th and final book in the \\"Left Behind\\" series.  For those not familiar with the series, Left Behind is based on the book of Revelation- it is a fictionalized account of the end times, loosely based on scripture.  Prior knowledge of the series is a must before attempting this book- but I must confess, that I read only some of the series (books 1/2/4) and skipped a bunch of the middle ones.  I got the last book this week and couldn't put it down, it concludes the series brillantly.<br />  In Glorious Appearing, the earth looks like it is at its end.  Nicholas Carpathia, the anti Christ, has taken over and amassed the largest army, the Global Community's Unity Army.<br />  This Unity Army is laying siege on Jerusalem, where the last of the Jews and believers have sought refuge.  Other Believers, including the Tribulation Force, have sought sanctuary in Petra-a fortified place.  But Rayford Steele and Buck Williams are missing;  Tsien Ben Judah has been killed.  It seems dire for the Tribulation Force and the rest of the believers, but God has his own plan.  He again sends Jesus to return to earth and defeat his enemies.<br /><br />  Glorious Appearing is a superb ending to this series.  Longtime readers wil not be disappointed to find out that the 7 years of Tribulation ends with the return of Christ. It is great to read the ending chapters and get reacquainted with past characters like Chloe, Bruce,Hattie, Albie and even Irene.  Even casual readers, like myself, will find satisfaction and triumph in the ending of the book.<br />  I have read alot of criticisms of the series because it does not adhere strictly to scripture, but it is Fiction..and should be read as such.  The book of Revelation itself is symbolic and open to interpretation and is available for everyone to read and interpret on their own. The Left Behind series is a great work of fiction...that can inspire its readers to explore their faith further and pick up their own Bible.r own Bible.	2004-03-30
US	51855253	R3W51UIQSYKFUE	0425163717	695515166	Holiday in Death	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Another winner.	The 7th book in Jd Robb's &quot;Death&quot; series is Holiday in Death.  Like her previous novels, it focuses on Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke and takes place in the future.<br />  The series is part sci fi, part romantic suspense, part police procedural drama, part murder mystery.  Eve is investigating a serial killer who dresses as Santa claus and chooses his victims via a dating service.<br />  The book also re-introduces secondary characters that have appeared in the earlier books- like Eve's partner, Peabody, fellow officers McNab and Feeney, police profiler Mira and reporter Nadine.  As each book progresses, we learn more and more about them as well as Eve and Roarke and the world that they inhabit.<br />  Eve and Roarke's relationship continues to evolve and he plays more and more of a role in her cases as the series progresses.  Its nice to see their relationship develop, despite Eve's abused past and her job.<br />  The book blends nicely the relationship part of the series and the murder mystery.  Its hard to guess who the ultimate killer is, at least until the very ending.  Holiday In Death is a great addition to a great series..can't wait to read the next installment.	2004-03-23
US	51855253	R3CALJXLBO6XA1	0425157628	737300478	Ceremony in Death	Books	5	4	5	N	N	The best one yet...	This is the 5th novel in the \\"Death\\" series and its the best one yet.  Jd Robb has really hit her stride with this novel- the characters are well fleshed out and the story line is fascinating.  For those not familiar with the series, Jd Robb chronicles the life and cases of police Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her billionaire husband, Roarke.  The novels take place in the future around 2058.<br /><br />  In Ceremony in death, Eve is forced to investigate the death of a fellow officer.  Her investigation leads her to satanic cults, Wiccan religious groups, and more murders.  It seems that everyone Eve questions ends up getting killed and soon Eve herself is the target.  Eve is disturbed by the ritualistic killings, especially given her own abused background.  And she has no shortage of suspects.<br />  The attraction of the series is the mix of suspense and romance- all meshed into a great murder mystery.  Its nice to continually follow the same main characters.  Their complex and evolving relationship are what keep me reaching for the next book.  Too often, storys concentrate on the courtship, but the Death series proves that marriage/committment are just as complelling, romantic and sexy.  Eve and Roarke have a great partnership and chemistry that has been evident since their first meeting in book 1, Naked in Death.<br />  While Ceremony in Death is the 5th book, those who haven't read the earlier novels won't get confused as each book is essentially self contained.  But loyal readers are rewarded as familiar characters are brought back--like Mavis, Peabody, Fenney and the butler.  But prior knowledge of the series isn't required- in fact, I read book 1 Naked in Death and then this one..and have read some of the others out of order.<br />  Happy Reading!	2004-03-21

The secret life of Bryan by Lori Foster is a great novel- it picks up the story of bounty hunter, Bryan, who was introduced in her previous novel (say no to Joe).  But for those who haven't read that, this story stands on its own as well.<br />  Bryan is masquerading as his brother, bruce,  a preacher who runs a safe house for prostitutes.  Bruce was attacked and Bryan is taking his place to find out why.  Bryan meets Shay--a wealthy socialite who is posing as a prostitute so that she can get closer to the girls and help them.  Shay and Bryan have instant chemistry but there are many lies that threaten their budding romance.  Complicating things, is that someone is indeed after the preacher and now Shay as well.  And it is someone they know and trust.<br />  The story is fast paced, the ending is great- you never guess the identity of the stalker or the accomplice.  It reintroduces characters from Foster's previous books- like Joe Winston, Luna, Jamie (the strange psychic).  It also gives us new people to like and await their stories- like Bryan's brother bruce, Joe's sister etc.<br />  This book has a little bit of everything- mystery, romance, suspence.  Its a great summer read.	2004-03-19

AS JD Robb, she writes a futuristic mystery/suspense series featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas and billionaire Roarke.<br />  Naked in Death is the first in the series- it takes place many years into the future (2058). It is fascinating to see how much things have advanced- the future is full of technology, rules/regulations, legalized prostitution and contraband luxuries.  But even with all these advancements, there is still murder.<br /> Eve is investigating a serial killing and she finds out that she is falling for one of the main suspects, Roarke. The serial killer is targeting prostitutes and using outlawed guns to make his point.  The investigation is complicated by the fact that one of the victims is connected to a very influential political family.  That family, and Eve herself, have secrets to keep hidden--secrets that have to be uncovered to stop the killer<br /> Naked in Death introduces Eve and Roarke and their complex relationship.  As a couple, they are compelling and have definate chemistry.  Despite the killings and Eve's past, they manage to begin their relationship which will progress in the books that follow and continue the series.<br />  The plot of the book is fast paced.  The ending conclusion and revelation of the murderer comes as a surprise.  Naked in Death is a great start to the Death series.	2004-03-08
US	51855253	RE4UMB5GUYJ7R	0553802461	288141977	Dead Aim	Books	4	7	8	N	N	I liked it!!	I have been reading some mixed reviews about this book with some people loving it and some people (mostly longtime Iris Johansen readers) finding it not up to par.  I have read 2-3 books by Iris Johansen and find that this book is one of my favorites.<br />  Dead Aim is about photographer Alex Graham who is taking pictures of what appears to be a natural disaster.  She soon finds out otherwise--as she overhears the conspirators and witnesses them murder one of her friends.  Alex is soon on the run from the killers and from the government, who mistakenly think she may have something to do with the disaster.<br />  Judd Morgan is a loner who is persuaded to help, protect and guard Alex.  He is a man with a complicated past and is also on the run from an assassin as well as the CIA.  Helping them is Galen and billionaire John Logan.<br />  I thought that the plot about conspiracy, terrorists and government was fast paced and well done.  It is a suspenseful mystery as Alex and Judd find out who they can trust.  Instead of focusing on international terrorism, the terrorists are actually working within the government...so no one is what they seem.<br />  It was nice to revisit with old characters like John Logan, Galen/Elena and Sarah/monty the dog.  The ending was exciting as Alex runs from the killer and they try to stop a terrorist plot. Dead Aim was a great read and one that will keep readers turning the page!	2004-03-06

Fallen Angels by Lori Foster is a collection of related stories- two of which are older, previously published works and one (Uncovered) is new.  Each story is interconnected and has similar themes of secrets and mystery.<br /><br />  In Beguiled, Dane Carter has come back to investigate his twin brother's murder.  He even pretends to be his twin to Angel Morris, who was involved with his brother and has a child with him.  Dane is attracted to Angel, but also must try to protect her from the killer.  Complicating their romance is the lie Dane is keeping in pretending to be his twin.<br />  In Wanton, Celia (who is Dane Carter's sister) has sworn off men when her ex fiance was found to be a criminal and only marrying her for her money.  Celia is now determined to make up for her past bad judgements by helping others.  Private Investigator, Alec,is Celia's boss who has to keep her safe while they investigate and convince her that love is not wrong.<br />  In Uncovered, Harris and Clair are best friends but Clair has always been secretly in love with Harris.  Accidentally, Harris finds some nude pictures of Clair along with Clair's unsigned notes professing her crush on him.  Harris is immediately intrigued by this unknown woman and hires Clair's private investigation firm (run by Dane and Alec) to find his mystery woman.  Surpringly, none of the 3 men recognize Clair's body in the photos and start a search for this woman.<br />  It is nice to have each story in one volune and see how each story is related.  Lori Foster always writes exciting, romantic books and these short stories are no exception.	2004-03-03

It tells the story of beautiful and exotic model, Rana, who leaves the modeling profession and her controlling mother.  She is burned out and tired of being just another pretty face..the last straw is an arranged marriage that her mother is pushing her into.<br /><br />  To get away, Rana reinvents herself as Ana Ramsey...a plain,drab artist and hides herself away in a boarding house.

But Ana quickly rebuffs him and forces him to see her real self and hot her looks.<br />  Trent and Ana fall in love, but Ana is still keeping her real identity a secret.  Eventually Trent finds out who she really is.  Trent and Ana's relationship was touching and the characters were likable.  Ana's struggle with her looks, modeling, mother and agent etc. made the book well paced and kept the storyline moving.<br />  Even though it is one of sandra brown's older novels, it is still worth a read.	2004-02-03

It started with Key of Light and Key of Knowledge...three women who are brought together to find 3 mysterious and enchanted keys to unlock the box that holds the souls of 3 demigoddesses.  Key of Valor is Zoe and Brad's story.<br />  Zoe is a single mother raising her son Simon.  She is mistrustful of Brad who is a rich businessman.  But Brad has always been attracted to Zoe, even before they met, he saw a painting of her face and it has haunted him.  Now, Brad fights to be included in her and her son's life.  Complicating their relationship is Zoe's search for the Key and the threats/evil that want to prevent her from finding it.  Kane is an evil otherworldly sorcerer who is going to try and stop Zoe from her quest.<br />  Helping Zoe is Brad, as well as the mysterious Rowena and Pitte and also zoe's friends..Mallory, Dana, Flynn and Jordan (all of whom had their own stories in the previous novels.)<br />  Key of Valor is great in that the relationships between the 3 women are just as important as the relationship between zoe and brad, and zoe and her son.  It is nice to see such strong and complex friendships and to re visit with the heroes and heroines of the first 2 novels.<br />  The story line is interesting and well paced...there never seems to be a dull moment in either the quest for the key, or the relationship between the two main characters.  The final ending is exciting and well planned...a fitting ending to this great trilogy!	2004-01-29
US	51855253	R31OI6MUZW4CM6	0515136379	214237042	Key of Knowledge	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Can't wait for the finale!	Wow..as always, Nora Roberts blows me away with her writing and stories.  This book was no exception. Be warned..it is the second book in the Key trilogy, so be sure and read the first one before attempting this novel. (key of light)<br />  The key of knowledge follows librarian Dana on her quest for the missing key that will unlock a magical box and free three celtic demi goddesses from their long prison of sleep.  Joining her on her quest are Mallory and Zoe..her best friends, business partners, and fellow key searchers.<br />  Helping Dana is Jordan Hawke, a mystery writer who she has always loved but who broke her heart when she was younger.  Jordan is determined to win her back, help her find her key and protect her from the evil god, Kane.  Their relationship is complex--friends, ex-lovers, he is also her brother's best friend.<br />  This book expands on the story line introduced in the first book- Kane becomes more of an active evil force, Pitte and Rowena are better characterized, and it is nice to revisit with Mallory, Flynn, and Moe (from the first book).  The book also gives us a glimpse of what's to come in the final book with Zoe and Brad's relationship<br />.<br />  The second book was in my opinion, better than the first book- Dana is likable, complex, smart and her emotions are multi-layered.  She is once again attracted to Jordan, but knows that could lead to another broken heart.  She is at a crossroads in her life- having quit her steady job and taking a chance on opening her own business.  She is also on a time limit to completing her part of the key quest.<br />  I love how Nora Roberts uses Celtic myths and magical elements to enhance the story.  It is so well done that it is easy to suspend belief and really believe in the legends, gods, curses and evil.<br />  I can't wait to finish this trilogy and eagerly await Zoe and Brad's story....	2004-01-25

This is the second in a triology - following Logan who is a hard working public defender trying to avoid his father (a well connected judge) and his father's plans for his life.  Logan doesn't want to run for political office and what better way to end his public career than to be involved in a scandal.  Enter logan's sweet grandmother- who just happens to have the perfect woman for Logan--Cat, the owner of a catering company that has a shady past.<br />  Cat and her company are hired to cater a party.  Cat and Logan are thrown together by his grandmother and they have immediate chemistry.  At first, Logan plans to use her but he quickly finds out that she is someone special.  With some not so subtle help from his grandmother, Cat and Logan end up together.<br />I liked that Cat's sister and brother in law (stars of the first book) were kept in this and it introduced Grace (logan's sister) who will soon have a book of her own.<br />  Simply Scandalous is a good book with fun characters, but be sure to read the first book before this to get the full background of the sister's story/family as it is not explained in this second novel.	2003-12-21

In this age of reality TV, many will be fascinated, repelled, disturbed and intrigued about this look in the life of a resident intern at a large teaching hospital.  For those in the know, it is a sarcastic yet honest glimpse of the perils of an intern.<br />  House of God focuses on Dr. Roy Basch- a new intern who is working at a large teaching institution.  Like all interns, he is thrown in with the instruction to &quot;keep the patient alive.&quot;  He battles grueling schedules, hopeless patients, attendings and disease.  He learns from the chief, interns and residents--and even the patients &quot;gomers&quot;.<br />  For those who are unfamiliar with medical training this book would be very disturbing, but for those of us who know what residents go through...it is surprisingly real.  I first read this book as an M4- just about to start July 1st internship.  As an M4 you are cocky, arrogant and optimistic and this book was funny, sacriligous even.  I read it again after finishing residency and was struck by how honest it was to the residency experience..sometimes painfully so.<br />I liked the book when i first read it, but i can appreciate it more now...It is surprising that the author was able to capture the feelings of interns and be brave enough to put it into book form.	2003-12-13

Nora Roberts often writes exciting trilogies and this book is no exception.  Key of Light is the first in her new series and explores ancient celtic mythology in today's contemporary environment.<br />  Mallory, Dana and Zoe are three women who are offered a chance to solve a centuries old mystery.  Long ago, an Evil celtic god had stolen the souls of 3 young goddesses--who happen to resemble Mallory, Dana and Zoe in paintings.  These souls were then locked and magically sealed in a glass box with a spell to keep them there until they can be unlocked with 3 keys.  The enchanted spell has the three women looking for the 3 keys to release these lost souls.<br />  Helping these women are Flynn, and his 2 best friends- Brad and Jordan.  They also are connected to the mystery and the solution.  Mallory and Flynn are this book's focus.  Mallory represents art and beauty and she is to find the first hidden key.<br />  Also assisting the couples are 2 mysterious beings that are overseeing the search and guiding the women.  Pitte and Rowena are great characters with a mysterious back story and they promise to figure in the next books as well.<br />  Key of Light is the perfect blend of romance, mystery, suspence and mystical elements.  Mallory is the perfect heroine- independent, willing to believe in the celtic myth, loyal to her friends etc.  Flynn is the hero who helps her despite his skepticism.  It is fast paced, exciting and intriguing with great secondary characters of zoe/dana/brad and jordan--all of whom will have their own storys in the following books of this trilogy.	2003-12-06

No one to Trust is the story of rebel Elena- who is trying to protect her son from his rapist father, a columbian drug lord (Chavez)<br />Helping Elena is Sean Galen,  but their efforts to keep her son safe are thwarted by Chavez's determination to get his son by any means.  He sends hitman to kill those protecting her and offers staggering amounts of money to bribe anyone--the identity of the final betrayer certainly comes as a shock.  Amid the battle, the romance between Elena and Galen is believable, but the secondary characters of Dominic, Jared etc added to the book's readability.  It was also nice to mention her past characters- logan.<br />This book was a combination of adventure, romance, suspence and is a great book to read! Can't wait for her next!	2003-11-28

This was the second book by Cherry Adair that i have read--the first being Kiss and Tell and for some reason, this book was a little disappointing.<br />Out of Sight tells the story of AJ- a female sniper in an anti terrorism unit.  Due to a training mishap, she has lost her edge and makes a mistake on her first assignment.  Her partner is Kane- a legend in the anti terrorism unit.  Together, AJ and Kane are after a terrorist who has stolen a virus and intends on releasing it.<br />They follow the terrorist over the desert to his hiding place to stop his plans.  On the way, the battle his henchmen, their feelings, the desert environment etc.<br />In premise, this book sounds like it should be great, but AJ was a little one dimensional and the book was off.  I liked the character of Kane but never felt the chemistry was on between him and AJ.<br />Like other readers, i thought that Kane guessing Aj's real name was hilarious, but otherwise the story seemed disconnected.  I hope her other books are better.	2003-11-24

The book also is greatly illustrated, making it fun and easy to read.<br />The book is broken down by clothing type- skits, shirts, dresses, sweaters, jeans, pants, suits, bags, underwear, swimsuit, coats etc.  It also offers chapters on what to pack for a trip, classics to collect, taking care of your clothes, lucky rules of shopping and featured stores.  A nice bonus is the lucky breaks discounts at the end (but be careful- they expire by the end of the year, not giving much time)<br />Each chapter is then subdivided into styles, must have pieces, styling tips, fashion tips, how to wear it etc.<br />The book also features several hip chicks with their recommendations on how to achieve the hip and fashionable look.<br />My one complaint is that they featured clothes that I wanted, but no link to wear i can get it!!

This is the 2nd book, i've read by Julie Garwood (the first being Heartbreaker) and so far she is 2 for 2.  What a great book- Mercy has romance, suspense, mystery..<br />Mercy is the story of surgeon Michelle Renard &quot;mike&quot; who is attending a society gala when Justice Dept attorney Theo gets stricken and needs emergent surgery.  Theo is in Louisiana and helps investigate a secret club of white collar criminals.  Together these 4 have secreted millions of dollars but they agree not to touch the money for 5 years.<br />The club's leader, John, plans to kill his wife Catherine and threatens their club's safety.

They hire Monk to help them but it ends up that John is not telling the whole truth.<br />The club eventually targets michelle as she is the one person who can destroy them and expose their club.  Theo helps her investigage and protect her.<br />The main characters were rich and believable and the story line was fast paced and exciting.  Even better, the secondary characters of monk, Michele's dad (big jake) , theo's family and even the criminals enrich the story.  Mercy is a great book!!	2003-11-21

It is a decent and average romantic suspense novel but readers have come to expect more from heather graham than average.<br />Haunted tells the story of ghost-buster Darcy.  The book actually starts out great w/ the prologue that introduces Darcy and how she came to obtain her paranormal gifts.  But once it comes into the present story, the book loses its steam.  it should have stuck with the original characters- darcy, josh, hunter.  But instead, we get Darcy who is called to investigate the haunted house of Sheriff Matt Stone.<br />Matt is predictable as the skeptical small town sheriff.  Darcy must overcome his attitude and skepticism while she investigates the ghosts of Melody House.  Darcy starts to have dreams about past murders and must figure out who haunts the house.  Soon, Darcy herself is placed in danger with suspicious accidents - falling into an open grave, falling through rotting floor boards etc.  And she soon finds out that the hauntings of Melody House have a very real and present cause.<br />Heather Graham fans may be disappointed as this book is not up to her usual caliber, but it is a decent read.  Some of the dreams/hauntings are quite creepy and the plot does have some twists (but not surprising ones).	2003-11-21

I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers and say that this book is not one of Lori Foster's best.  However, i still bought it to read because i had always loved Lori Foster's novels and thought i would at least give it a chance.  Alas, i should have paid more attention to  the wiser readers/reviewers...this book was ...not good.<br />Usually you can count on Lori Foster to deliver a well paced, sexy story with great interesting characters, but this book as a little..off.<br />Ray jean is the heroine who is a female mercenary.  She is hired by Eli to rescue his little brother (jeremey) who is being held hostage in central america.  While Ray may be a mercenary, she never comes across as tough or independent or even likeable.  The relationship between the two seems forced and predictable- with none of the usual plot twists, excitement that is usually found in Lori Foster's books.  I found the plot to be predictable and plodding--it was hard to even finish the book.<br />Hopefully the next book she writes will return to her usually stellar stories..for now, give this book a miss.	2003-11-16

In Eleventh Hour, Savich and Sherlock, the author's popular recurring FBI agents and married partners, take a back seat to fellow agent Dane Carver.<br />  For Dane, this case is personal.  He is guarding the only witness to his twin's shocking murder in a church confessional.  His investigation of his brother's death, leads him to find that the killing is eerily similar to the latest episode of a new TV series.  Somebody, connected to the show, is recreating the show's murders and Dane must find out who it is and keep his witness alive.<br />  Complicating this case is the fact that the killer knows about the witness (Nick).  There is also a convoluted sub plot dealing with Nick's own secret past.<br />  Eleventh Hour is a good suspense mystery that revists favorite past characters.  I read this book without having read most of Catherine Coulter's past FBI novels and felt that this book could stand alone.  For fans already familiar with the series, I am sure it is a welcome reminder of the now married Sherlock/Savich.	2003-07-28

Complicating matters is the fact that Anna had a unique bond with her triplet sisters--a bond that had always excluded Jason.<br />2.  Fade to Black by Amanda Stevens- is about a CIA agent who goes missing- leaving a wife and unborn son.  He returns 5 years later as if nothing had happened- he doesn't remember any of the 5 years.  His wife has changed alot in the 5 years he has been gone but still loves her husband-only she cannot trust that he will not leave her again.<br />I enjoyed these stories, but agree that there was not alot of character development and some of the plot was wildly improbable (especially about the pregnancy in the first story).  It is a good book for those looking for superficial reads with not alot of depth- a fair summer read!	2003-07-17

Keith Topping has become an expert in crafting fun to read episode guides on our favorite tv shows (see his Buffy guide).  Roswell has been off the air for several years but lives on in syndication (Sci-Fi) and picks up new fans (like me!) with every showing.  This guide is great to read along with the episodes- it helps you get the very most out of each show.<br />  This guide covers all the essentials of Roswell including:<br />**cast bios<br />**list of episodes<br />**episode description including- synopsis, quotes, guest appearances, errors<br />**internet (Roswell is the one show where fans really made a difference, saving it from cancellation time and again, and sparking the creative tobasco mail in)<br />**novels (few know that Roswell was based on teen novels)<br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars was that it didn't cover the other seasons- with Roswell off the air (hope to see a movie!) , the author should update his guide to cover the entire series.  (of course, after he writes the updated Buffy guide to cover all 7 seasons of BtVS--why are all the good shows leaving???)	2003-06-27

As a single girl with no kids- I have not been swept up in the Harry Potter craze,but i am a fan of the book as adult contemporary literature. It is worth reading. The Harry potter series is marketed as a kids book, but I know that alot of adults enjoy it with their children.  I hope that more and more adults will give this remarkable story a try- it has alot of grown up themes.<br />  Like the other books, this fifth installment starts out with Harry Potter's summer with his muggle family.  This allows us to cover his whole year at Hogwarts and ends with him leaving for the summer at years end.  This year is quite different for Harry- he is ostrasized from the kids (who think he's crazy); from Dumbledorf (for reasons to be explained); and even from his best friends (who are now prefects).  No one believes him about the return of Voldemort and Harry and the Order of the Phoenix are battling the dark forces- not knowing who is on their side or who can be trusted.<br />  This book is filled with darker images which is more appropriate as Harry grows older and is faced with difficult challenges and choices.  There are also more adult subplots-harry's adolescent romance, losing loved ones and even racial differences (muggles vs wizards, house elfs, pure bloods vs. those that are not pure etc)- it is quite an adult theme to deal with especially in these times.<br />  I was happy that the author's writing style is also more sophisticated than in her previous novel, and the length of the book was not intimidating once you start to read it.  Each book can be read as a stand alone, but this book did not give the typical summary of past events so readers will get more enjoyment having read the previous 4.<br />  All in all, I encourage adults and kids alike to pick up this amazing story and be transported into another world.  Besides, anything that makes kids start reading, has to be good!	2003-06-27

This is Mac Blade's story- the son of Serena Macgregor and Justin Blade (don't forget to read their story).  Darcy Wallace is a librarian running away from her small town life and marriage to a local bully.  She ends up in Vegas- penniless, homeless and like a fairy tale, ends up winning almost 2 million dollars w/ the last of her money.<br />  Darcy is very likable and her naivete in Vegas bring's out the hero's protective instincts- shielding her from the press, her ex-fiance, and people who would take advantage of her new found wealth.  It is a predictable love story, but i thought that was the charm- the two characters (esp Mac) struggle through their feelings, their differences and end up together.<br />  It was nice to bring back old favorites -Serena, Justin, and of course, Daniel Macgregor himself.  His matchmaking attempts are so funny and the basis of this series.  However, even if you have never read any of the Macgregor books- this one can stand alone.  Its a must read!	2003-06-26

There are some authors that you know always write engaging novels that you cannot go wrong with- Lori Foster is one of them.  The Men of Courage series introduced Riley and Regina and finally Riley has his own story.<br />  Riley is an ex Swat team member who runs a gym as well as works as an evidence technician.  He meets Regina, a journalist, when she comes into his gym looking for some self defence training.  The police do not believe her, but Regina fears that her life is in danger.  She gets a &quot;guard&quot; dog and much of the book's comedy revolves around her 4lb pet chihuahua &quot;Butch&quot;.<br />  This story is humerous and well written, Riley and Red are a good match.  The added mystery of who is putting her in danger is a nice bonus, plus the antics of the cute little dog will keep you turning the page.  Another winner!!<br />Be sure to read the Men of Courage anthology first- Ethan's story will introduce you to Riley and Red.	2003-06-20

Nora Robert's books are always winners, I am never disappointed with her stories or the caliber of her writing and this book is no exception.  I am amazed how she can keep writing new and exciting stories.<br />  Years ago, a baby girl was stolen/kidnapped from the local mall during christmas- leaving a devestated mother, brother.  Now, Callie Dunbrook is an archeologist who is digging a site with her ex husband.  Suzanne sees Callie and immediately knows it is her kidnapped daughter- she contacts Callie, but callie know she is mistaken, she is not adopted!<br />  Of course, she is mistaken and Callie ( with the help of her ex husband, Jake) begins to uncover the mystery of her life. However, this immediately puts her life in danger as there are others who do not want this illegal baby scheme exposed.<br />  A nice subplot to this is Doug- Callie's natural brother whose life was turned around by his baby sisters disappearance.  His love story is a great subplot in this book.<br />  All in all, a great book if you like mysterys, suspence, romance and intrigue- this book has it all.	2003-06-20

Included in this book are tips on:<br />**style<br />**retail secrets<br />**wardrobe building<br />**basics<br />**accessories<br />**trends<br />Her suggestions are a little impractical for those not in a business environment (one of her tips is to buy 1 suit per season).  She bases her wardrobe on jackets/blazers and suits/skirts.  This may not be practical for the younger, more casual urban girl.

This is a guide book to the hit show the West Wing.  It was written by Keith Topping who has authored several other show guides including Buffy, Angel and Roswell.  This covers seasons 1-3 of the show.<br />I like this book and the author's style of writing.  It does not contain in depth episode synopsis or analysis so those looking for that would have to look elsewhere.  This book is meant for those who have seen the episodes and want more in depth knowledge.  It covers<br />**cast/ brief bios<br />**episode list<br />**episode analysis which includes in its section<br />------american history<br />------political references<br />------donna comments<br />------logic problems (continuity errors)<br />------quotes<br />**a very brief internet intro to west wing<br />All in all, this book is fun for fans and those familiar with the episodes.

It is more geared to the adult viewer and fan and fully covers season 3 and 4 of BtVS.<br />It is a more indepth review of the actors, characters, behind the scenes workers and of course the episodes. It does an especially good job with the Season 4 finale (restless)- which is confusing and full of symbolic meaning, allusions and prophecy.  It also gives us an indepth behind the scenes view of what goes into making a Buffy episode (the I in team).<br />The book is also filled with great photos and ilustrations.  It is a great book for all Buffy fans, and even the casual viewer will appreciate all the nuances that are involved in each episode.  Buy this book!	2003-06-19

This one contains two stories-<br />**Alan's story- alan is the first born son and a US Senator with aspirations for the presidency.  He falls for Shelby- an eccentric Washington potter who's father was also a senator and assassinated when she was just a girl.  For this reason, Shelby does not want to get back involved into politics.  Alan spends most of the book plotting to win over her and I enjoyed his attempts to do so.  This was a charming novel.<br />**Grant's  story--Grant is a reclusive artist who lives in an old lighthouse.  Gennie is on the run from a tragedy in her past and is stranded when her car stops.  She winds up on Grant's door-like a breath of sunshine.  He wants to remain a recluse but Gennie has gotten into his heart.  It is quite funny and touching, esp when they go visit the Macgregor family.<br />I very much enjoyed these stories as i have all the macgregor novels- Nora Roberts certainly has crafted a winning dynasty.	2003-06-18

This >600 page book is the entire seventh and final season of Buffy made into a book- and covers the entire last season of the series from episode 7-1 lessons to the last chosen.  For buffy fans, we have already seen the season play out on TV, but the book is a nice compiling of the stories, themes and arcs.<br />Having all the episodes as one makes it easier to see the connecting arcs- reading what the characters are thinking/feeling is a great bonus, esp in the final chapters.  I liked hearing this author's interpretation of buffy and spike's final moments in the hellmouth as he is dusted by sunlight.<br />The book lost a star with me, due to the horrible editing and proofreading.  The story was great, but the constant grammar errors, typos, etc were very distracting and sometimes confusing.  If we could somehow clean up the editing, this book would rate 5 stars!	2003-06-17

She is a powerful witch and owner of a bookstore, who has had her heart broken by Sam Logan many years ago.  Sam left the island but he is now back to win Mia back.  Mia has closed herself off to love since Sam's leaving and he must convince her to love again.  Admist this is the supernatural story of 3 witches (mia,ripley and nell) who are fighting a demon in human form.<br />This story is not your typical love story- there is no doubt of Sam's love for Mia or of her love for him.  Rather, it is the struggle of Sam to get Mia to accept his love and trust in him and in them as a couple.  Also nicely woven in, is the subplot of the 3 witches and their power and fight.<br />I definately recommend reading the other 2 novels preceding this-it helps get the full background and inter relationships.  This is a great book- nora roberts writes with passion, character depth and intricacy.  A sure winner!	2003-06-17

This anthology is the start of the American Heroes series in HT.  It introduces us to Ethan, Brett and Matt- 3 bachelors who jobs forces them to risk their lives.<br />*Trapped features Ethan- a firefighter who was publically humiliated by his former fiance.  This makes him gunshy when it comes to relationships but his lifelong friend is determined to melt his heart<br />*Buried is the story of Brett and Haley who are brought together in the aftermath of an Earthquake.  Brett is a search and rescue worker who helps Haley find her pet.<br />*Stranded is the last book about Matt (a doctor) who rescues Molly from a flooded river.<br />These stories were average and not your typical Lori Foster book.  The plots were too contrived and resolved too quickly.  There is not much drama or tension to the plot lines either.  Having said that, they do introduce Riley, Sean and Luke- their characters (esp Riley) seem much more interesting and I cannot wait for their stories.  My advice would be to pass on this collection- pick it up at a used book story if you must..it is not worth the full price	2003-06-16

She immediate things about Darius- who is indebted to her and has made a promise to be there for her.  Miraculously, he appears and whisks her aaway to his protection.  Together they unravel the mystery of who is threatening her.<br />*Last Chance Cafe- Lena is a waitress who lost her husband tragically.  3 years later, a customer (cade) walks into her cafe and resembles her husband.  This is a shorter story and you cannot help but root for Lena as she deals with her past.<br />*Bayou Moon by Rebecca York--Chase has inherited an old manor and finds his childhood friend Julienne in residence.  They share a past filled with sadness- she is the daughter of the manor and he is the son of their servants.  But now their positions are reversed- Chase is now the owner and she must work for him while hiding her past secrets.  This was actually my favorite story of the 3--very touching and sad, showing how love can overcome even the most awful event.<br />These 3 storys were fun to read, but had been previously published and are not new.  They were short and the plots seem to resolve themselves very quickly- with little time for much character developement.<br />My advice would not to pay full price for this book- definately check out Jayne Krentz's other novels and pick this one up at a used book shop.	2003-06-16

It doe snot go fully into great depth.  As a startig handbook, its a great read, but those looking for specific/detailed coverage may have to look elsewhere.<br />I personally liked the breezy, fun and humourous way the book was written and ilustrated.  However, I was not expecting it to guide or change my life, so my expectations were not high.  I definately think it is worth reading mainly because of the fun, not for the advice.	2003-06-16

Due to this injury, he has lost his zest for life, until a beautiful Physical therapist (dione) comes into his life to make him live again.  She of course has her own past troubles to contend with and their journey to come together is what drives this story.<br />Come Lie with Me is a shorter novel and can be read in 1 day- the plot is alittle too similar to some other stories out there (most notably Adam's Fall by s.

Both have spent the intervening years apart trying to forget and concentrate on their careers.  Years later they meet up when Meredith discovers that their divorce was never finalized- and she has a new fiancee (parker)!

Both have their own misunderstandings about their youthful marriage and what drove them apart and matthew wants desperately to try to make things work again- despite thinking that Meredith had betrayed him earlier.<br />  This book was heartwrenching and complex- making you cry and root for the characters.

I often read cookbooks for enjoyment not for recipe guidance and this one seemed to be made for me.<br />It is, of course, based on the hit show.  The chapters are divided into characters (instead of the usual food categories-dessert, main meals, appetizers, soups etc).  It has a lot of pictures from the show and of the food.  Their is an index for those looking for a particular recipe.  The chapters features letters, comments, thoughts from the characters which any fan would enjoy.<br />This cookbook is a fun read and is a tongue in cheek version of a cookbook- you can tell right away that the purpose is entertainment.

I am not a big fan of the Clintons and have been a life long republican. Despite this, I found this book well written and a fascinating inside glimpse of marriage and politics.  The book was also nicely illustrated and filled with photos of her from childhood to present.<br /> I expected this book to be very political but Senator Clinton has given readers a look at her background and college years, how she and her husband met in school, her decision to go back to arkansas with him and eventually enter the political arena. Even her detractors have to admit that she is an accomplished well educated person.<br /> Most fascinating are the White House years and all the associated scandals. She writes candidly about her time as First Lady and the various battles she had- with healthcare, with white water, with her marriage and monica lewinsky etc. She came across as very likable and sympathetic ( and this from a die hard republican!)<br /> All in all this book was a worthwhile read- it is giving us a glimpse of the inside workings of washington during turbulent times.

The Chesapeake Bay Triology is expanded into a saga with the addition of this fourth book.  This story is a sequel to the original trilogy about the Quinn brothers and this book focuses on younger brother, Seth Quinn--who is certainly deserving of his own story.<br /><br />  Seth is a painter/artist who has returned to his small hometown to be near his 3 brothers and run away from the demons that have haunted his past- namely an evil biological mother and the mystery of his own paternity.  He finds and meets his soulmate- Dru.  Dru has settled into running a flowershop in this small town but she is also fleeing from her own past torment as well.  Both don't want a permanent relationship but are drawn to each other.  Their story is a great ending to this series and it is nice to catch up with the other Quinn brothers and their wives as well.  It is also great to resolve the mystery of who Seth's father is and put to rest his conflict with his birth mother.<br /><br />  I read this book without having read the triology, but since finishing Seth's story, i have read the Chesapeake Bay triology _(seaswept, inner harbor etc) I definately think you can read this as a standalone novel but those familiar with the previous books will find this as a satisfying conclusion.	2003-06-06

It is a quick and brief way to review the mainpoints of disease (differential diagnosis, workup, treatment etc)on your way to morning report or before attending rounds.  I found it easier to read than the washington manual.<br />Another plus is its compact size that can easily fit into your labcoat pocket and can therefore be available on the wards, on call and while sitting through lectures.<br />It is not, of course, a replacement to the Harrison's text--but who can carry harrison's around with them everyday??	2003-05-19

It stands alone but does introduce the other two brothers and make you want to read their stories too.<br />The Playboy is about the middle brother Rick- a cop who thinks he can avoid marriage now that his younger brother has gotten married.  He meets Kendall- a young commitment phobic woman who is fleeing her own wedding.  Both are independent and fighting their feelings but of course end up together.<br />This book is great summer reading- lightweight and fun and makes you eager to read the whole trilogy	2003-05-17

Bad Boys on Board is a 3 book anthology with writers' Lori foster, Donna Kaufman and Nancy Warren.<br />Lori Foster's story (my house/my rules) is my favorite- telling the story of Sam and Ariel- Sam is a great hero. He is a cop trying to do the right thing and avoid his brother's girlfriend, despite his own feelings for her. Of course, Ariel has other ideas and what follows is a steamy read.<br />I liked Donna Kaufman's story \\"Going Down\\" about 2 people trapped overnight in an elevator but was less impressed by Nancy Warren's story. \\"A Fast Ride\\"- was about an undercover agent who has amnesia after a motorcycle accident and is found by the heroine who nurses him back to health.<br />All in all, the book was an enjoyable summer read- definately worth the purchase for those who enjoy the Bad Boy series and who are fans of Lori Foster's writing.	2003-05-16

Unlike her usual novels, Three Fates focuses on 3 couples as they search for 3 statues.  Their search takes them to Europe, Ireland, New york - and each of the 3 couples are diverse and captivating.<br /> This easily could have been as 3 separate stories (like her other trilogys) and i was disappointed on how brief some of the storylines for the couples seem.  But all in all, it was a great summertime read!	2003-05-15

But these few problems do not detract from how great fans will find this book.<br /> while this may be too much for a casual viewer, i'm sure all buffy fans would want to add this to there collection!	2001-12-18
