Even though it's a book of fiction, it still could happen.  In the book, most of the characters find their real selves at the end.  I also recommend the comapanion to Downriver, River  Thunder.	2000-04-20

I gave this book 3 stars because some of the things the characters did were believable, but some were not. Like when Troy threw away the map-that was believable, but when a group of &quot;escapees&quot; use such clean  language while they are being hunted down under so much stress, I thought  that was kind of out of place.	2000-04-20

Sometimes I don't like advertrous books, but this one was good. My faviote person was Jesse. I could relate to Jesse the most, so I understood her more. I liked Downriver so much that I had to read River Thunder. River Thunder is good  too! I recommend both books to everyone.	2000-04-20

It was fun to learn about river rafting and the Grand Canyon. I also liked it because it was so unpredictable. The group of teenagers would come up on a  question and you didn't really know what or how they would answer. I think  this book would be good for someone ready to try new things. This book  would also be good for someone that like to run away from everyone and  every thing for a while. In closing I liked this book and would recommend  it to anyone. Thanks for reading!

It was full of action and I liked it alot. The characters were acting smart in some parts and dumb in other parts. The part where they were acting dumb was when they stole some alcohal and got drunk. The part where they acted smart was when  they thought fast and they held off Al with a knife.I think every one  should read this fun book.  ()	2000-04-20

It is the perfect, coolest, best book ever!   The only problem. . . foreshadowing.  To much of it you know exactly what will happen next, and how it will happen.  This destroyed the 5-Star of the book; in my opinion.  I don't even like to read but this WAS  the best book I have read and it was very fun it had many adventures that  kept it going and on it's feet even if it had alot of foreshadowing.  I  recomend this book for all 8 graders alike, even if your teacher doesn't  read you still can with out her or anyone else.  JUST GRAB THIS BOOK AND  READ IT ALREADY!     Sklour	2000-04-19
