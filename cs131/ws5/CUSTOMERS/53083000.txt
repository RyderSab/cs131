US	53083000	R1OD66DA0V10BA	0060545607	485010020	With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Secateurs and fanlights	Elizabeth George is the only novelist... well, OK, besides J. K. Rowling... that I buy in hardbound because I can't wait for it to come out in paper. This one is a gem. Her last novel, _A Traitor to Memory_ was something of a departure from the mainstream of her novels. I thought it was sensational, but not everyone agreed. _With No One As Witness_ is not only one of her best novels to date, but is also a return to the style and substance of her earlier novels.  <br /> <br />It is not important to read her novels in order. This one is not only sensationally good, but is also a good introduction to the whole series. George has an of ensemble of continuing characters, but does not make a point of including everyone of them in every book. This one, however, includes the whole cast: Lynley, Helen, Deborah and Simon St. James, Nkata, and of course, Barbara Havers.  <br /> <br />I say \\"of course\\" because I happen to be a Barbara Havers fan and am always a little disappointed in the novels where she makes only a cameo role. So I'm pleased that she plays an important role here.  <br /> <br />I have accused Elizabeth George of being cruel to Barbara Havers and subjecting her to more than her fair share of unkind vicissitudes of fate. In this novel, however, fate is reasonably kind to Havers. I can't say much more about what happens to these characters without spoiling the plot. So let me go on to trivia. <br /> <br />I love George's handling of the British atmosphere, while occasionally wondering whether she overdoes it. I have a theory that the word \\"secateurs\\" appears in every one of her novels. In this one, the secateurs duly make their appearance on p. 144. <br /> <br />I think I've caught her in a mistake! On page 446, she \\"Tatlises... admitted Lynley and Havers to the room... it was a dismal enough chamber... dingy curtains covered the single transom window.\\" I believe \\"transom\\" in this sense is an Americanism and that the ordinary British term is \\"fanlight.\\" <br /> <br />Did I notice a hommage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories on p. 475? Barbara Havers discovers that an apartment dweller's obnoxious dog Pearl, who barks at everyone and everything, did not bark at midnight on the night of a crime, at a time when other residents thought they heard \\"a cry of some sort.\\" The Sherlock Holmes story \\"Silver Blaze\\" contains the famous exchange \\"Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?\\"  \\"To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.\\" \\"The dog did nothing in the night-time.\\" \\"That was the curious incident,\\" remarked Sherlock Holmes. Pearl's failure to bark at midnight is a curious incident, with a similar explanation. <br />  <br />Come to think of it, \\"Pearl\\" is also the name of the fictional (late) dog owned by Robert Parker's fictional detective Spenser, so perhaps we are getting two hommages for the price of one.	2005-05-30

Sixty will be a new age for me. Statistics say with reasonable luck I should reach that new age, then seventy, and eighty, and with very good luck ninety, and... who knows? <br />But what will I do? Assuming that I WILL live, HOW will I live?<br />&quot;Young at Heart: Aging Gracefully with Attitude&quot; consists of fifty-seven or so interviews with good role models. Crosman says she posed them the same question: &quot;What was their secret of living long and well?&quot; <br />There are no pat answers. Crosman says up front that their secret was &quot;not to dwell on aging,&quot; but that's no answer. It just raises the next question, HOW do you do that? The answers--specific, individual, and crackling with energy--come out in the interviews. <br />The style is journalistic. This, Crosman says, is what old people who are living well do, and how they do it. Most of the interviewees have unsentimental, no-nonsense attitudes. They don't say aging is great. Ruth Christie Stebbins says &quot;This business of hip-hooraying being 100 years old--I say anybody who goes when their 80 years old is the lucky one!&quot; <br />The book does not consist of abstract advice. It is fact on fact, seemingly prosaic detail on detail. It doesn't feel inspirational in the usual sense; the language is plain and colloquial. And yet something comes through.<br />If I--well, OK, I can't escape the song lyrics--If I should survive to a hundred and five--nobody is going to be able to tell me what _I_ need to do for myself. But here is what other people are doing. Here are people who have explored that territory and Anne Snowden Crosman has brought their reports back.<br />I think this book would be a good gift for anyone approaching retirement age.<br />Oh, the interviews are with Steve Allen, Ray Geiger, Lina Berle, Malcolm Boyd, Sammy Cahn, Ressa Clute, Elizabeth and Edmund Campbell, Servando Trujillo, Nien Cheng, Paul Spangler, Georgie Clark, Monk Farnham, Marjory Stonman Douglas, Aveline and Michio Kushi, Edmund deTreville Ellis, Martha Griffiths, Dale Evans and Roy Rogers, Jeanne Beattie Butts, J.

US	53083000	R1CBJWXRKJZIPF	0553802585	383484197	I, Richard	Books	2	48	48	N	N	I love Elizabeth George's novels; I disliked this book	I'm a great Elizabeth George fan. She is one of a small number of writers whose works I buy in hardbound. <br />But I'm afraid she's no short story writer. <br />The collection gets off to a bad start with \\"Exposure,\\" which ought to be interesting to George fans because of the presence of detective Thomas Lynley. But the story is a mess. I don't understand the perpetrator's motive. The \\"puzzle\\" aspect is poorly presented--we're not really given enough of a clue to solve the puzzle ourselves. The perpetrator actually commits two crimes--and I don't believe that the methods used to commit either crime would have worked in real life.<br />Three of the the stories feature \\"O. Henry endings,\\" none of which, in my opinion, quite come off. <br />The title story, \\"I, Richard\\" intertwines a sort of pseudo-mystery story concerning the truth about Richard III and the Princes in the Tower, with a modern-day murder story. Unfortunately, to someone who isn't a \\"Ricardian,\\" the Richard III part is muddled and boring--and the framing murder mystery is unbelievable, except for the ending--which is all too predictable.<br />Similar motifs recur in several of the stories--giving a slightly stale or repetitious flavor to the collection.<br />Perhaps the best is \\"Good Fences Aren't Always Enough,\\" which comes close to being sad and touching.  But all of them, even this one, read more like extended jokes than like real stories. The characters in them are paper cutouts. The author's attitude toward her characters is remote and almost contemptuous. She never seems involved with them, nor do we. The stories succeed neither as slices of life nor as clever little clockwork gadgets.<br />And, incidentally, the book is a rather poor value. There are only five stories in it. It's thin, the type is large, and the lines are widely spaced. By my estimate, it contains roughly about 70,000 words (for [money amount]) or about one-fifth as many as  \\"A Traitor to Memory\\" ([money amount]). Distinctly short measure, to my way of thinking.	2003-03-28
US	53083000	RDRNIVZADELB5	0895262762	107650463	Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth?	Books	4	33	56	N	N	Fair, accurate, and well-reasoned--up to a point.	I detest creationism. I'm an agnostic. I have a degree in zoology. <br />This is a good book.<br />Jonathan Wells' motives may well be suspect, and the purpose of this book may well be to supply ammunition for creationists who want to attack their local school curricula. According to an article by Wells on a Unification Church website, [...] ,  \\"Father's words, my studies, and my prayers convinced me that I should devote my life to destroying Darwinism.\\" <br />It doesn't matter.<br />This is a good, well-written, cogently argued book. Up until about page 229, I think what it says is accurate and reasonably fair. It is a good example of critical discussion.<br />Well's \\"icons of evolution\\" are well-known textbook examples of supposed facts that support the Neodarwinian theory of evolution: industrial melanism, Darwin's finches, etc. I don't think see how you can challenge him here; these are not straw men, these really are the \\"textbook examples.\\"<br />Wells proceeds to argue that each of these \\"facts\\" is misinformation or worse. And I think his critiques are quite justifiable. <br />He also asserts that these \\"facts\\" are widely known to be faulty, yet continue to be repeated in textbooks. He implies strongly that the reason for this is that there is an extrascientific agenda at work. Here we get into murkier waters, but, yes, I believe that pressure from religious dogmatists has forced evolutionists into a dogmatism of their own. Scientists have been too willing to circle the wagons and present a united public front against the creationists.<br />I've read a number of articles that attack this book, and I think most of them do not succeed very well. For example, Wells points out, correctly enough, that the textbook photographs of _Biston betularia_ on light and dark-colored tree-trunks are all but fake. What can possibly be said in defense of faked photographs in textbooks? That it doesn't matter, because many other textbook pictures are also fake? That many naturephotographs might best be described as posed illustrations of true facts? Or (worst of all) that if something is true it is OK to use inaccurate but memorable pictures to illustrate it?<br />School committee members may fear, perhaps justifiably, that irate citizens are going demand that school biology textbooks be labelled with the \\"warning labels\\" he so helpfully provides in Appendix II.  And certainly the notion of \\"warning labels for textbooks\\" is a politically charged attack. <br />But even the actual text of his \\"warning labels\\" is reasonable enough: (\\"WARNING: Archaeopterix is probably not the ancestor of modern birds, and its own ancestors remain highly controversial; other missing links are now being sought;\\" \\"WARNING: Darwin's tree of live does not fit the fossil record of the Cambrian explosion, and molecular evidence does not support a simple branching-tree pattern.\\") <br />Perhaps Wells is a dogmatist who is cleverly feigning the spirit of free inquiry in order to make an effective attack. And quite possibly Wells deserves to be attacked _ad hominem_. But I think it is best to speak to the actual words he puts on the page.<br />And I can go with him at least as far as page 229. I say if he's right, he's right-and-up to page 229-I think he IS right, by and large, for the most part.	2002-08-24
US	53083000	R1X6CUQ3VZDATU	0786867345	399419494	Carter Beats the Devil	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Echoes of Doctorow's "Ragtime?"	I loved it. Even though I'm not particularly fond of magicians or magic acts.<br />I see that Amazon has excerpts. The section Amazon lists as \\"Intro pages\\" is really the beginning of the story (entitled \\"Overture.\\") When I read this section I was hooked. The rest of the book lived up to my expectations.<br />I was attracted to it in the first place by the cover, and I think the cover artist (identified only as \\"GTC Art and Design\\") did a good job of conveying something of the spirit of the book, although not, perhaps, its sweet melancholy.<br />First, the obvious. I don't happen to be a big fan of magic or magicians, but I'm sure that those who are will want to read this book. Those of us who are nerdy enough to know the name \\"Philo Farnsworth\\" will want to read it. (Come to think of it, is there such a thing as a Warren Harding aficionado? You, too, will want to read it...)<br />\\"Carter Beats the Devil\\" reminded me of E. L. Doctorow's \\"Ragtime,\\" in a good way. When I read \\"Ragtime,\\" I thought \\"What a wonderful, TOTALLY original book.\\" And when I read \\"Carter Beats the Devil,\\" I thought \\"This is a wonderful, original book--in the same genre as _Ragtime_.\\" <br />The book is a beautifully constructed page-turner, the kind that keeps you up late not merely because you want to know what happens next, but because you _care_ what happens to the people in it.<br />I think you are expected to notice that Gold constantly makes use of misdirection. Events are constantly being foreshadowed, but when they occur there is always a surprising twist to them. And perhaps you are expected to notice that in accordance with the magician's code, Gold _never_ explains how any of the tricks described in the book are performed. I have to say that towards the end that becomes a little annoying; as the Church Lady used to say, \\"how CONVENIENT!\\" But perhaps it's necessary. For the book to work, Carter has to achieve miraculous-appearing things--beyond those that the historical Carter achieved. For the writer to achieve the near-miracles of developing workable methods of achieving  these effects, he would need to be as skillful a magician as his fictionalized Carter. <br />There are a few annoyances. Recently, I have read too many books that give me the impression that the writer is angling for a movie contract and has deliberately dropped a cinematic passage into a literary book. A novel in which the descriptions are interesting to READ will suddenly be interrupted by a long passage that sounds like a description of stuntwork. \\"Cut to the chase\\" is fine in a movie, but chases do not make interesting reading. To me, the climactic final battle between Carter and his nemesis Mysterioso had that flavor. Somehow, after reading that passage, I was not surprised to find that the movie of \\"Carter Beats the Devil\\" is, in fact, in the works.<br />The literal-minded among us will cavil at the way he inconsistently invokes \\"grounding\\" to explain why an electric cable fails to electrocute the good guys at one point in the struggle yet electrocutes the bad guys later. And--I'm trying to avoid a spoiler here--I object to a certain plot point on the grounds that the surface of a wine bottle is CURVED.	2002-05-19

It engaged me, I stayed up late reading it, and I enjoyed it.<br />But... oh, are there ever plot problems in this one.  The heavy plot machinery clanks and groans. I couldn't really believe any of it for an instant. <br />I couldn't believe Bosch dunnit. I couldn't believe McCaleb could believe Bosch dunnit. And I couldn't believe the REAL criminal would have risked being so subtle setting up a frame. He couldn't possibly have been sure that McCaleb would pick up the clues and draw the right conclusions, I mean the wrong conclusions, I mean the conclusions the criminal wanted him to draw.<br />And, while I have no objection to a writer naming his character after a fifteenth-century Dutch painter (any more than I object to Parker naming his after a fifteenth-century English poet), making the name figure directly into the plot sounds to me as if the writer is running short of ideas.<br />Still, a good read.	2002-05-07

I really enjoyed it. Like many adventure novels (those of Hammond Innes and Nevil Shute come to mind), I loved it for its evocation of time and place. <br />It is, frankly, hard for me to imagine a time when radio drama had any real weight or importance. Lately, I've been listening to old-time-radio recordings during my commute--just finished a thirty-CD collection of Dimension X and X-Minus-One science-fiction shows, preceded by a 10-CD collection of detective shows, and, you know, mostly they're junk. The best of them barely reach the level of , say, _Star Trek_ or _Columbo_. Even _The War of the Worlds_ is lightweight. But I can remember the days of _Playhouse 90_ on television and I suppose there must have been a time when radio at its best was in the same league.<br />For me, then, the narrative drive of this book was not the silly, complicated, and unbelievable mystery novel, but the excitement of being at a radio station where important things are happening and the cast, crew, and management know it.<br />I won't dwell too much on the flaws... except to say that I never found it believable when Hamlet rigs a play for the specific purpose of tricking a criminal into revealing his guilt... and I don't find it plausible when the tragic hero of this novel does the same thing.	2001-11-15
US	53083000	R37N1MLAZMZ3HP	0375504397	237509158	Black House: A Novel	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Good, but not really &quot;a sequel&quot; to The Talisman	I'm a Stephen King fan and I liked &quot;The Talisman&quot; a lot. I liked &quot;Black House&quot; and I think most Stephen King fans will too.<br />One caution up front. As Amazon's description of the book makes clear, the villain in this book is a serial child killer who eats his victims. There may be more than a few people who find this idea so disturbing that even my mention of the theme bothers them. It probably will not help these people if I say &quot;it's just a STORY, it's almost comic-book stuff, it's not THAT graphic, they don't MEAN it.&quot; <br />I read fantasy and horror to escape from reality, so I am glad to report that &quot;Black House&quot; has no references in it to airliners, explosions, or tall office buildings. It served me well as a welcome distraction during the last few terrible weeks. <br />&quot;Black House&quot; is not really a sequel to &quot;The Talisman.&quot; It's an independent book with some loose connections to &quot;The Talisman.&quot; (And almost as many to the Dark Tower series). <br />True, the central character of  &quot;Black House,&quot; Jack Sawyer, is the central character of &quot;The Talisman,&quot;--but so much time has passed that he is almost a different person. A few other characters from &quot;The Talisman&quot; make what might be called cameo appearances. <br />To me, this book felt like a &quot;typical Stephen King novel.&quot; It did not really evoke the feelings and mood of &quot;The Talisman.&quot; (I don't mean to slight Straub here; but I will say that the collaboration is seamless--and the result reads like King).<br />Unlike &quot;The Talisman,&quot; most of events in &quot;Black House&quot; take place in this world. It is &quot;about&quot; a cop chasing down a serial child killer in one of Stephen King's black, ironic, inverted &quot;Our Towns.&quot; More like the world of &quot;It&quot; than the world of &quot;The Talisman.&quot; <br />(I've enjoyed trying to figure out where &quot;French Landing&quot;is. My guess:  Prairie du Chien).<br />The authors imply that there may be a trilogy in the offing, with the third book taking place mostly in the Territories... but part of the charm of &quot;The Talisman&quot; was Jack Sawyer's strange balancing act between the two worlds.<br />This book has what I'll call the &quot;usual beloved faults&quot; of King's writing. Unlike a J. R. R. Tolkien or a Robert Heinlein, the writers never convince me that the story is taking place in a real, consistent world with well-defined rules. They're making it up as they go along, and they (and you) know it. Some of the &quot;cross-references&quot; to other characters and events feel like the sorts of things you get in a detective series. You know, &quot;Lance Sterling called Edna Redstone, the librarian who had helped him solve in 'The Mystery of the Haunted Windmill.&quot; Then he drew out the pocketknife that had served him so well in 'The Secret of the Red Lighthouse.'&quot; <br />What this means to readers new to King is, no, you don't need to read &quot;The Talisman&quot; or the Dark Tower novels first. You'll probably get the feeling that some mysterious things would make more sense if you'd read them, but it's not really true. There's no grand unified story to figure out, and it's OK to come in the middle.<br />For those to whom the title &quot;Black House&quot; instantly calls to mind Dickens' &quot;Bleak House,&quot; the authors are aware of the similarity and work it into the story. (Whether there's supposed to be an intentional connection, I can't say--I've often suspected that if editors notice things in King's writing that are uncomfortably derivative of other books, he disarms cricitism by deliberately acknowledging them ).	2001-10-09

These discussions do have their interest, but I do not feel that &quot;Things A Computer Science Rarely Talks About&quot; really stands on its own. <br />A better title for this book would have been something like &quot;3:16: The Story Behind The Book.&quot;<br />Consider chapter 4. This is mostly a series of stories about how Knuth and Herrmann Zapf asked many of the world's leading calligraphers to illuminate the verses he used. He talks about the suble colors used to print them, the delicacy of the originals (not fully picked up by a 600 dpi scanner and requiring pixel-level editing to prepare them for reproduction).  It therefore can only be described as irritating to be presented with these pictures, about fifty of them, in the form of  little 2x3&quot; halftone reproductions. <br />I do not feel the book delivers much on the promise that Knuth will reveal &quot;the many insights that [he] gained&quot; from the work. He talks a good deal about the reasoning and the process behind the project and it is quite interesting, perhaps even inspiring in the sense of making one wish to do likewise.  But his presentation of his own beliefs is rather muted and low-key.  I perceive this as modesty, not evasion. Still, it is not what I expected. Consider chapter 4, again: we learn a great deal about how he feels about the esthetics of the calligraphy, how he edited them, how he dealt with issues like calligraphers who inadvertently made mistakes in the text. But are there really any religious insights here? Well, subtle ones, perhaps.<br />I think he is sincere when he says, referring to &quot;3:16,&quot; &quot;I am not here today to sell copies of the book.&quot; In a discussion, someone asks &quot;What would you recommend for computer science students who have never read the Bible?&quot; and I believe Knuth is joking when he says &quot;The number one recommendation is that they should certainly read my book. You know, it makes a wonderful Christmas gift. More seriously...&quot;<br />Chapters 5 (&quot;Glimpses of God&quot;) and 6 (&quot;God And Computer Science&quot;) are fascinating, and come close to delivering on the promise of the book. I would gladly read a book-length expansion of this material in these two chapters.<br />Still, on finishing this book, I am aware of two feelings: a) an interest in reading &quot;3:16,&quot; and b) an irritation with myself for having purchased this one.	2001-09-15
US	53083000	RYF5U4Y0DPZ26	0553801279	337342267	A Traitor to Memory	Books	5	16	17	N	N	This fan liked this magnum opus--maybe her best yet	This is a long novel. There are some thicker-LOOKING hardbounds, on my shelf, but they're in bigger type. \\"Novel length\\" is sometimes defined to be 60-80,000 words. By my best estimate, \\"Oliver Twist\\" is about 170,000 words; \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\\" 220,000 words; Stephen King's \\"Insomnia,\\" 300,000. Well, \\"A Traitor To Memory\\" tips the scales at 365,000. I can't imagine what the paperback is going to look like.<br />It's taken me almost two weeks to read this book, and I've been spending a lot more of my life reading it than I usually spend in reading. I was immersed in it, loved every minute of it, and I'm at loose ends now that I've finished it and have to return to normal life.<br />It is a very complicated plot with an awful lot of characters. As usual in whodunnits, I am totally unable to keep track of the \\"puzzle\\" aspects. So I cannot tell on what page Ellery Queen could have solved the puzzle. What I can say is that, reading it for pleasure--well, actually racing through it because I was continuously desperate to find out what came next--I was gratified at the skill with which Elizabeth George blends the threads and keeps everything comprehensible. I couldn't figure out whodunnit--I never can--but I never had any problems remembering who's who. Not even the guy with three aliases--four if you count his cybersex \\"handle,\\" TongueMan.<br />The character development is wonderful, and even though the mystery plot requirements mean that many of the characters need to be very unpleasant people, this is brought out gradually. The plot-specific characters seem real, I get involved with them and care about them. My right brain is completely committed to believing they are real long before my left brain notices that they are one-dimensional monsters devised to function as cogs in the plot machine. <br />For whatever reasons Elizabeth George lives in California and chooses to write British mysteries. Being an Anglophile myself I enjoy this, although sometimes it does get a little overdone--you know the sort of thing, \\"As she listened to the telly, Adele put the Horlick's on the Aga. 'Bollocks, the biscuits have gone missing. Nigel dear, could you pop round to the baker's and fetch some scones?''\\"  In this novel, she has a wonderful American character and, in a wonderful bit of transatlantic cultural virtuosity, gives her a slightly exaggerated Americanism, an American seen through British eyes. I really like Libby, the American in question, and it just wrings my heart to see her becoming involved with that rotten Gideon...<br />Thomas Lynley, Lady Helen, Deborah and Simon St. James make appearances as relatively minor characters; the soap opera among these continuing series characters does get advanced a bit. There's not much about Barbara Havers' personal life in this one; I was hoping to find out how she's getting on with her Pakistani neighbors, especially Haddiyah. On the other hand, we get to know Winston Nkata personally in this one and something seems to be developing between him and one of the mystery-plot characters. <br />I have thought of forming a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Barbara Havers. In the universe George has created she sometimes seems to be playing the part of Job. But George is merciful to Havers in this book. So many characters in this tragic novel end up disappointed or far worse; by comparison what happens to Barbara seems quite bearable.<br />I'm going to ask my wife to pay attention near the when she reads this, and double-check for me. It does seem as if there are a number of loose threads that are not essential to the plot but that one wishes would be tied up. As the book ends, there are least two characters who I am no absolutely certain whether they are alive or dead. In fact, even at the end I am not absolutely, positively 100% sure that I know whodunnit or what the motive was. I don't think clearer-headed readers will find this a problem, though.<br />It does occur to methat George is one of a number of authors for whom I wish someone would compile an detailed index.

Know any engineering students? Now you know what to give them for their next birthday gift...<br><br>Now come the quibbles, but before I start, let me just say that I gave the writer a break and went along for the ride and wasn't disappointed. <br><br>Whatever happened to illustrations in novels? Yes, I know they haven't done them since around World War I, but why not? I had hoped Jack Finney's \\"Time and Again\\" would change that, but no. The lack of illustrations is the biggest single flaw in this novel. Pictures of the historical Iron Bridge are easy to find on the Web, and the author, has a nice collection of them on his Web site. But we really need a picture, and a good one, of Samuel's alternate design.So much of the plot turns on Samuel's bridge:<br><br> \\"The arch was heightened !from a semicircle to a parabolic curve; and instead of making the tress members straight, as in timber constructions, Samuel had curved them fancifully, calling attention to the uniquess of cast iron as a building material. The arch rose from either side of the roadway like wings. 'It looks like a butterfly!' Maggie exclaimed.\\"<br><br>The story depends on our believing that this design is aeshetically brilliant, and also that it contains an engineering flaw that Maggie is aware of. For those of us with inadequate visual imaginations, it is frustrating not to be able to see Samuel's design.<br><br>Now for the real nitpicks. The novel is full of small awkwardnesses. David E. Morse has not completely succeeded in immersing himself in the eighteenth century, and one has a mental image of him visiting historical sites, doing library research, and making notes (ah... the servant lived under the stairway, I can USE that...). At times I was reminded of \\"The Keeper of the Gelded Unicor!n,\\" Ira Wallach's parody of bodice-ripping historical novels: \\"Two public letter-writers whispered in a corner. Outside, the cry of the fishwives could be heard over the shouts of the children laughing and clapping as the dancing bear performed in the streets thick with cutpurses.\\"<br><br>I thought there was some gratuitous sex (\\"See, we Quakers are not prudes\\"), and Maggie is too busy with a complex role in a complicated plot--like an actor still trying to learn her lines--to come alive for me as a real character.<br><br><br>There are the usual problems with time-travel novels. There were two, however, which I thought were handled quite well. Dropped four centuries into the past, Maggie is constantly encountering language and cultural problems, and passes them off by saying she is from the United States. I thought this was all handled convincingly, without descending into situation comedy or passing the bounds of belief.<br><br>Second, the plot is based on the idea of attempt!ing to change history--to redirect the Industrial Revolution into less destructive channels--by interfering with a single, critical event. Will she succeed? Will she fail? That's all a little stale and tedious, but the way he finally resolves this question is nice--even if the story has a Moral.	2001-06-23

One reason I say &quot;buy it&quot; is not necessarily because it's fabulous.<br /> It  IS very good. It DOES deliver what I expected. It is solid, complete and good value for the money. Despite the fact that it constantly refers to the program &quot;iMovie,&quot; it IS a manual for iMovie 2, thoroughly revised for iMovie 2, and not just a retread of the earlier iMovie book.<br /> But the main reason I say &quot;buy it&quot; is that the time when you'll get the most value from this book is when you're just starting to use iMovie 2. Or, even better, BEFORE you've started to use iMovie 2, maybe even before you've bought your Mac.<br /> Don't dither. Don't delay. Don't pinch pennies. By all means, feel angry at Apple for not including any manual with iMovie 2. I know I do. But don't cut off your nose to spite your face. Just go ahead and buy the book, already. Buy it first, fume about the twenty bucks later.<br /> If you wait, you'll stumble your way through iMovie on your own. You CAN get by with iMovie's built-in help, but that's what it is--getting by. Buy the book afterwards and it will just be confirming guesses you've already made. Buy it first and it will save you time and trouble.<br /> Pogue does a very skillful job of using sidebars and inline &quot;tips&quot; so that the needs of both beginning and proficient users are addressed in a single unified narrative.<br /> Part 2 of the book--about 200 pages is the &quot;missing manual&quot; per se. The rest of the book covers topics such as recording DV on a camcorder, readying it for Web publication, and summaries of more advanced editing tools (Final Cut, Premiere, EditDV). I found this material to be excellent. I found the section on using Quicktime Pro particularly helpful. Traditional manuals act as if the software they document is the whole world. This &quot;manual&quot; is better.<br /> In fact, Pogue is at his best when he goes a little beyond what a normal manual would cover. For example, there are very sensible couple of pages on what you reasonably can and can't expect if you try running iMovie on an older Mac. There's an excellent discussion of just what iMovie does at different screen resolutions.<br /> So, why didn't I give it five stars? Well, it's mostly a matter of taste. I feel that Pogue has too much of the breezy, uncritical, if-you-can't-say-something-nice-don't-say-anything-at-all magazine style. Everything is just sooooo great.<br /> &quot;It's fascinating, important, and useful to note that iMovie never actually REMOVES the audio from a video clip.&quot; Are all THREE adjectives really necessary? Useful, yes; important, OK. But &quot;fascinating?&quot;<br /> Is it necessary to laud the little first-time demo clip as &quot;gloriously filmed&quot; with a &quot;catchy little guitar lick&quot; and &quot;children dancing in exquisite lighting conditions?&quot;<br /> You can sure tell that &quot;Pogue Press&quot; has a different editorial style than &quot;O'Reilly.&quot; And, for the record, I prefer the O'Reilly style. I honestly don't think you'll find a better guide to iMovie than this one. But if there were such a thing as an O'Reilly Nutshell Guide to iMovie--with an animal woodcut on the cover--I'd reconsider.	2001-01-20

Parker 's Spenser novels have gotten stuck in a rut, a result of needing to keep the storylines consistent with the characters' past history. I continue to read them avidly, but they seem a little stale.<br />All he has done here is to keep the same basic cast characters but change their names, genders, ethnicities, and sexual orientations. This simple gimmick actually works quite well. <br />&quot;Family Honor&quot; reads and feels just like a Spenser novel--a fresh, rejuvenated Spenser novel, like the ones he was writing a decade ago. It's like seeing the same group of actors in a new sitcom after a few too many years of seeing them in the old one.	2000-11-19

Those who are Dick Francis fans will enjoy it, those who have not read Dick Francis before should not start here... try the earlier books. <br />But I do recommend it as a good read. One scene in particular sticks in my mind. I don't want to spoil it by describing in detail, but it involves a surprising moment of beauty in a situation of great peril where nobody would even think of seeing beauty... and I am NOT referring to the eye of the hurricane.<br />Of the dozen or so loose ends, one that intrigues me is the relation between the two meteorologists Perry (the first-person narrator) and Kris. Kris is a manic-depressive, and it is implied that for some reason Perry feels an obligation to take care of Kris and try to prevent him from being suicidal in his down phases. Later on, when an (equally baffling) combination government-spymaster-and -ghost-writer asks Perry whether he'd like to author a book on meteorology, Perry's throwaway answer, is what he'd most like to do is write a book on (!) depression! This is never followed up... the ghostwriter does help him write a book on meteorology, however.<br />I seem to recall another Dick Francis book--can anyone else remember the title?--in which the first-person narrator is one of Dick Francis's horse-racing-detective-types, and throughout the entire book is in a state of depression, functioning brilliantly, tracking down bad guys, solving mysteries, running around getting things done, and constantly feeling lousy...	2000-10-28
US	53083000	R3FQZMSYLXCXS9	1581570104	404569435	Arlo, Alice, and Anglicans	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Really first-rate in every way. SURPRISINGLY well done.	I don't think I've ever seen a better piece of  journalism.<br />I didn't expect too much from this book. I bought it for the usual tourist reasons (we were in Stockbridge to hear Arlo sing in the church). Published by Berkshire House, it graces the &quot;local shelves&quot; tables of every local bookstore and gift shop.This book didn't actually need to be GOOD. It just needed to have some scraps of fan information about Arlo and some old pictures of the Church and Officer Obie and so forth...<br />I cannot begin to describe how surprisingly satisfying this book is. It is really a first-rate job. It is so much more wide-ranging and thoughtful than might have been expected. <br />And Laura Lee covers the exact range of topics I was interested in, with just the right balance. <br />For example, about a quarter of the book is devoted to the &quot;pre-Arlo&quot; era. It's more than a lick-and-a-promise, interesting both in itself and as a jumping-off-point for musing on How Things Change. I never realized that the little fork-in-the-road Van Deusenville area of Housatonic was once a significant industrial town... At the same time, a quarter of the book is just about enough. I didn't want to wade through monograph on Great Barrington history, and after paying proper respect to the Bostwicks and the Van Deusens, we get to Ray and Alice Brock by page 65.<br />The thing that makes this book so splendid is Lee's sympathetic attention and reporting of _mild_ differences in opinion. I'm not sure I've ever seen a better piece of journalism. You see events refracted through different peoples' eyes--NOT a big-deal Rashomon conflict, just, well, different people saw things a little differently.<br />For example, Arlo's guru, Jaya Sati Bhagavati Ma, is seen through Arlo's eyes. She is also seen directly and with respect through Laura Lee's. However, Lee also reports the Berkshire Record's description of her as &quot;a spiritual Ethel Merman wielding a Brooklyn persona&quot; and Alice Brock's remark &quot;Here is this dame, she's my age, she's from Brooklyn, she's Jewish, just like me, but she had this giant scam.&quot;<br />Thoroughly satisfying, absolutely first rate.	2000-10-14

If you're reading this, either you're a died-in-the-wool Jack London fan or you know little about his work. <br />To those who liked &quot;The Call of  the Wild&quot; and &quot;White Fang&quot; and want to know what to read  next: the short stories! And of the novels, &quot;Martin Eden,&quot;  &quot;The Sea-Wolf.&quot; Among his LESS well-known works, I and others  have a high regard for &quot;John Barleycorn,&quot; &quot;The Road,&quot;  and &quot;The Iron Heel,&quot; and many love &quot;The Star-Rover&quot;  (although I don't care for it).<br />Now, as for those who just can't get  enough Jack London and want to know what this book is like: it's not bad.  It's readable. It is a Jack London account of a passage around Cape Horn in  the last days of the sailing ship. It is based on a trip Jack and Charmian  (and of course his valet Nakata) made in 1912. <br />Three-quarters of the way  through this book I was almost ready to classify it as a hidden Jack London  treasure but it really falls apart. <br />The problems? Well, loose  construction and loose ends, common Jack London faults. He establishes an  intriguing cast of grotesque characters and curious plot twists and then  never resolves any of them. It builds up wonderfully, then it lets down  miserably.<br />For example: the mutineers have a mysterious source of food  which makes it hard for the officers to starve them into submission. Jack  London elevates this to the status of a major riddle and refers to it again  and again,  until I reached the point of being really curious about what  happened. And he never tells us! <br />Worse: what became of Mr. Pike and Mr.  Mellaire? For two-thirds of the book he builds toward a confrontation  between them. During the mutiny, Pike leaves the deck intending to find  Mellaire--and, basically, both of them simply vanish! <br />Like many of his  later tooks, this book contains the usual amount of racialist crappola, but  not enough to ruin the book for me. The good guys win because &quot;we, the  fair-pigmented ones, by the seed of our ancestry rule in the high places  and shall remain top dog over the rest of the dogs,&quot; etc. And there's  the usual amount of what I can only call mushy stuff<br /> &quot;The  Sea-Wolf,&quot; the protagonist earns his strength and self-reliance. In  &quot;Elsinore,&quot; he simply comes into it as his Aryan birthright.	2000-09-02

This is a quirky, individualistic, passionately eccentric book in which  fiction, fantasy, and fact are inextricably mixed up. I enjoyed it.   <br />There is no way for me to ask Jack London about the truth of this book,  but Jerome V. Lofgren was kind enough to answer some questions I had, and  to give me permission to quote them.<br />(DPBS) &quot;The Search for Jack  London&quot; is told in first person by a narrator who claims to be Jack  London's reincarnation.  Is this simply a literary device or (as the blurb  material suggests) do you truly believe this?<br />(JVL) What I personally  believe is not the issue here..  From the onset in my prologue and in the  text itself I put forth that if you believe in reincarnation read it right  from the tap.  If you don't believe in reincarnation at least accept it as  a literary technique to tell a beautiful story (Such as The Star Rover)..  This is not a dissertation on reincarnation but an effort to understand  Jack and Charmian London.<br />(DPBS) The story is framed by &quot;the annual  banquet celebrating Jack London's birthday... the Jack London Foundation  gathered as they had each  year in the Sonoma Country Club.&quot;  Is your  description of this meeting  intended to be: factual? A dramatized version  of real events? Fictional?<br />(JVL) A dramatized version of real events.   However, the actual confrontation with Clarice Stasz took place on  September 30, 1987 at a BBQ hosted by Russ and Winnie at their Glen Ellen  home with Earle Labor, Milo Shepherd their spouses and Clarice.  It was a  very foggy night when Clarice hoved to out of the fog to launch her  broadsides at me.<br />(DPBS) In the portions of the story which are told in  Jack London's voice, I can, here and there, pick out actual quotations from  Jack London's works (a snippet from &quot;To Build a Fire&quot; first  Klondike episode, a snippet from &quot;The Cruise of the Snark&quot; in the  passage where he meets Ernest Darling, etc.)  Are theparts told in  London's voice _largely_ pastiches of quotations?<br />(JVL) As Russ Kingman  commented repeatedly, anyone who gets immersed into Jack will encounter  the, &quot;Dreadful Parallels.&quot;  My question to you is what other  voice would Jack speak in?<br />(DPBS) The narrator quotes the late Russ  Kingman repeatedly and at length as having very definite opinions on  various controversial aspects of Jack London's life.  Are these actual  quotations from Russ Kingman's writings? If not, do you represent them as  factual and as being accurately representative of his views?<br />These are  Russ' actual words.  Russ went over this manuscript several times and gave  his approval of my actual representation of him. As Russ commented, &quot;I  come off as a Southern Baptist Preacher, as of course, I  was.&quot;<br />(DPBS) In places, you mention events in Jack London's life  that are not well-known to his biographers (his affair with the Native  American woman, Ruth).  Are these actually buttressed by material you found  in your researches?<br />(JVL) Russ asked the same question in the book.  And  I answered by pointing out how it came to be in the story.  Jack never  wrote of or spoke of that period from January to May when he was alone in  the cabin, &quot;a time when he came to himself.&quot;  No matter how  Charmian tried to weasel it out of him he wouldn't tell. By the way Russ  was satisfied with my answer.<br />(DPBS) Is there a reason why you do not  provide notes or explanations to make it easier for the average reader of  this &quot;biography&quot; to pick out which things can be considered  recognized facts, and which are imagined, guessed, dramatized, invented, or  received via occult methods of communication?<br />(JVL) This piece was  written as a historical novel.  Irving Stone used this style in his  &quot;Sailor on Horseback&quot; without notes or explanations.  There are  over 20 biographies of Jack London with Stone's the most popular. Mostdied  a quick death.  Why?  That puzzled Russ and me.  So I set out to write a  different &quot;biography&quot; where the world, past and present, are  viewed through Jack's eyes.  Not only is the old Jack revealed more fully  but the present world of the friends of Jack London is revealed so that the  general public can visit Glen Ellen and appreciate the Ranch and the Jack  London Foundation.	2000-08-10

It's not well known and not frequently  anthologized.  I see that it was written in 1902 and that H. G. Well's  &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; was written in 1897, and possibly Jack London  sort of borrowed the theme as he was wont to do--the editor of this volume  thinks so--but &quot;The Shadow and the Flash&quot; is nevertheless  brilliantly original.  It is about two competitive brothers, both serious  amateur scientists of the kind you run across in Victorian fiction--who  decide to tackle the problem of becoming invisible, in two different ways.   You can almost make out a case for its' being &quot;harder&quot; SF than  Wells, because he explains the physics of how they do it.  The explanation  is sort of cockamamie, but the story carries you along.  <br />(The title  comes from the fact that each method has a flaw.  Neither produces total  invisibility.  One brother casts a shadow, the other produces prismatic  rainbow flashes when he catches the light at the right angle).  <br />The  other fourteen stories are equally entertaining, and some are more than  that.  &quot;A Thousand Deaths&quot; was written very early in his career  and is a haunting piece of fantasy.  &quot;The Unparalleled Invasion&quot;  has been anthologized frequently because of the prophetic way it  anticipates bacteriological warfare.  <br />Jack London was indelibly  impressed with what he saw in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and some  of this may have found its way into a number of stories about the breakdown  of civilization after a disaster. &quot;The Scarlet Plague&quot; calls to  mind the after-the-atom-bomb-has-fallen stories of a later day.<br />&quot;The  Red One,&quot; with which the book closes, possibly deserves the adjectives  &quot;great&quot; and &quot;classic.&quot;  And if one suspects that Jack  London had been reading H. G. Wells, after reading &quot;The Red One&quot;  I certainly suspect that Stephen King has been reading Jack London.<br />The  collection is well chosen. The editor's commentary is good.  This is a very  readable book. And it looks like it's put out by a brave little tiny  publisher, and I always like to support brave little tiny publishers.<br />Oh,  none of the stories are about dogs or snow.	2000-08-10

It may seem silly to ask this of a book that, at the time of its  publication was used by the WCTU for their campaign, and which is  recommended today by Alcoholics Anonymous; but ask it I will.  <br />Let me  note that &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; is one of Jack London's best books,  and the closest thing to an autobiography he ever wrote.  Chapters XXXVI  and XXXVII, where he describes the &quot;White Logic,&quot; contain some  the finest, most lyrical, most poetic writing he ever did.  <br />He describes  the minuses of alcohol, AND he describes the plusses of alcohol.  He  describes BOTH the minuses AND plusses vividly, with all the skill of a  great writer.  He is a man who LOVES alcohol. He is a man who knows he has  been damaged by alcohol.  He describes both.<br />He praises  saloon-keepers:<br />&quot;Saloon-keepers are notoriously good fellows. On an  average they perform vastly greater generosities than do business men. When  I simply had to have ten dollars, desperate, with no place to turn, I went  to Johnny Heinhold. Several years had passed since I had been in his place  or spent a cent across his bar. And when I went to borrow the ten dollars I  didn't buy a drink, either. And Johnny Heinhold let me have the ten dollars  without security or interest....&quot;<br />Of course, he balances this by  explaining how this is in saloon-keepers own interest, and says &quot;this  is not to exalt saloon-keepers.&quot;<br />He praises the physical strength  alcohol provides:<br />&quot;And here again we come to another side of  many-sided John Barleycorn. On the face of it, he gives something for  nothing. Where no strength remains he finds new strength. The wearied one  rises to greater effort. For the time being there is an actual accession of  strength. I remember passing coal on an ocean steamer through eight days of  hell, during which time we coal-passers were kept to the job by being fed  with whisky. We toiled half drunk all the time. And without the whisky we  could not have passed the coal.<br />This strength John Barleycorn gives is  not fictitious strength. It is real strength.&quot;<br />Of course, he  balances this by saying &quot;But it is manufactured out of the sources of  strength, and it must ultimately be paid for, and with interest.&quot;<br />He  makes alcohol sound exciting, dangerous, comradely, glamorous, manly.  Alcohol is his adventure, like his other adventures--indeed, as he  explains, an integral PART of his other adventures.<br />And in the end, when  he adds it all up, plusses and minuses, where does HE strike the balance?   What total does HE come up with?<br />&quot;And so I pondered my problem. I  should not care to revisit all these fair places of the world except in the  fashion I visited them before. GLASS IN HAND! There is a magic in the  phrase. It means more than all the words in the dictionary can be made to  mean. It is a habit of mind to which I have been trained all my life. It is  now part of the stuff that composes me. I like the bubbling play of wit,  the chesty laughs, the resonant voices of men, when, glass in hand, they  shut the grey world outside and prod their brains with the fun and folly of  an accelerated pulse.<br />No, I decided; I shall take my drink on  occasion.&quot;<br />I don't drink. John Barleycorn is the only thing I have  ever read that has made me feel that maybe I've missed something...	2000-08-08

I've been stalling and stallingfor years.  All I can say is, if you like Jack London, the set is worth it.  It contains 197 stories (by my count; oddly enough I couldn't find this statistic in the blurb or the introduction). ...<br />I think Jack London is at his best in his short stories.  NONE of his novels are QUITE first-rate, and as you explore beyond the famous ones the quality falls off rapidly.  Most of his less-well-known novels are deservedly forgotten. (&quot;The Little Lady of the Big Hous e-- EEeeeeeewwwww!&quot;)<br />This is not true of his stories. When you explore beyond the couple of dozen that are anthologized, you discover treasures.  I am finding that many of the stories I don't know are every bit as good as those I know.<br />One of my recent &quot;discoveries&quot; is a story entitled &quot;The Banks of the Sacramento.&quot; It's not deep, it's not portentous, it's not Great Literature--it's just a superbly constructed little gem of a suspense story* that concerns a fourteen-year-old boy who conducts a daring rescue of--well, read it.  Aloud, in company, if possible.<br />There are, as you'd expect, some curiosities, some juvenalia, some outright bad stories, but not enough to dilute the collection.  And of course even these have their interest.  &quot;The Handsome Cabin Boy&quot; is not a very good story, but it certainly is another piece in the puzzle of Jack London's sexuality.  <br />Look, if you've bought more than three collections of Jack London stories, you know you're going to buy them all eventually--so why mess around?<br />These are, as you'd darn well expect at the price, nicely printed, sturdy volumes.  They are intended for, and meet, both the needs of general readers and scholars seeking accurate texts.  One annoying peculiarity is that an alphabetical list of story titles appears only at the end of the third volume.  <br />These volumes are, alas, priced on the self-fulfilling assumption that theywill be bought only by libraries, and your library is probably where you will go for them.  (Interlibrary loans are a wonderful thing; be sure to ask about them if your library does not have these volumes). ....  END	2000-08-06
US	53083000	RDQWZ9T81MAJ8	1930364091	544241060	The Search For Jack London	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Quirky, eccentric, problematical... and interesting.	This is a quirky, individualistic, passionately eccentric book in which fiction, fantasy, and fact are inextricably mixed up. I enjoyed it.  <br />There is no way for me to ask Jack London about the truth of this book, but Jerome V. Lofgren was kind enough to answer some questions I had, and to give me permission to quote them.<br />(DPBS) &quot;The Search for Jack London&quot; is told in first person by a narrator who claims to be Jack London's reincarnation.  Is this simply a literary device or (as the blurb material suggests) do you truly believe this?<br />(JVL) What I personally believe is not the issue here..  From the onset in my prologue and in the text itself I put forth that if you believe in reincarnation read it right from the tap. If you don't believe in reincarnation at least accept it as a literary technique to tell a beautiful story (Such as The Star Rover)..  This is not a dissertation on reincarnation but an effort to understand Jack and Charmian London.<br />(DPBS) The story is framed by &quot;the annual banquet celebrating Jack London's birthday... the Jack London Foundation gathered as they had each year in the Sonoma Country Club.&quot; Is your description of this meeting intended to be: factual? A dramatized version of real events? Fictional?<br />(JVL) A dramatized version of real events.  However, the actual confrontation with Clarice Stasz took place on September 30, 1987 at a BBQ hosted by Russ and Winnie at their Glen Ellen home with Earle Labor, Milo Shepherd their spouses and Clarice.  It was a very foggy night when Clarice hoved to out of the fog to launch her broadsides at me.<br />(DPBS) In the portions of the story which are told in Jack London's voice, I can, here and there, pick out actual quotations from Jack London's works (a snippet from &quot;To Build a Fire&quot; first Klondike episode, a snippet from &quot;The Cruise of the Snark&quot; in the passage where he meets Ernest Darling, etc.)  Are the parts told in London's voice_largely_ pastiches of quotations?<br />(JVL) As Russ Kingman commented repeatedly, anyone who gets immersed into Jack will encounter the, &quot;Dreadful Parallels.&quot; My question to you is what other voice would Jack speak in?<br />(DPBS) The narrator quotes the late Russ Kingman repeatedly and at length as having very definite opinions on various controversial aspects of Jack London's life.  Are these actual quotations from Russ Kingman's writings? If not, do you represent them as factual and as being accurately representative of his views?<br />These are Russ' actual words.  Russ went over this manuscript several times and gave his approval of my actual representation of him. As Russ commented, &quot;I come off as a Southern Baptist Preacher, as of course, I was.&quot;<br />(DPBS) In places, you mention events in Jack London's life that are not well-known to his biographers (his affair with the Native American woman, Ruth).  Are these actually buttressed by material you found in your researches?<br />(JVL) Russ asked the same question in the book. And I answered by pointing out how it came to be in the story.  Jack never wrote of or spoke of that period from January to May when he was alone in the cabin, &quot;a time when he came to himself.&quot; No matter how Charmian tried to weasel it out of him he wouldn't tell. By the way Russ was satisfied with my answer.<br />(DPBS) Is there a reason why you do not provide notes or explanations to make it easier for the average reader of this &quot;biography&quot; to pick out which things can be considered recognized facts, and which are imagined, guessed, dramatized, invented, or received via occult methods of communication?<br />(JVL) This piece was written as a historical novel. Irving Stone used this style in his &quot;Sailor on Horseback&quot; without notes or explanations.  There are over 20 biographies of Jack London with Stone's the most popular. Most died a quick death.  Why? That puzzled Russ and me.  So I set out to write a different &quot;biography&quot; where the world, past and present, are viewed through Jack's eyes.  Not only is the old Jack revealed more fully but the present world of the friends of Jack London is revealed so that the general public can visit Glen Ellen and appreciate the Ranch and the Jack London Foundation. ÿ	2000-08-05

I've read about the Twenties and Thirties--Frederick Lewis Allen's _Only Yesterday_--but _Studs Lonigan_  brings it alive. James T. Farrell takes me into a dance marathon, a movie  palace, a Knights of Columbus initiation and somehow tells me the things I  want to know so that I have the illusion of understanding what it was  really like to be there.<br />James T. Farrell paints a picture for me far  better than, say, F. Scott Fitzgerald. I never really understand what's  going on in Fitzgerald's stories. He takes it for granted you are living in  the Twenties and know what they're all about. Farrell _shows_ me the  Twenties.<br />_Studs Lonigan_ will either leave you cold or grab you. If it  grabs you, you will find that it's the kind of book you just lose yourself  in. It will become your world for a few days.<br />He builds layer on layer of  prosaic detail. He seems to me to be exceptionally honest about what  everyday life is really like. One poignant passage near the end of _Young  Lonigan_ describing the day the fifteen-year-old Studs spends in the park  with Lucy, as his thoughts dart from one topic to another.<br />One moment his  thoughts are exalted: &quot;He took squints at everything from different  angles and watched how their appearances would change... he listened to the  sound of the park, and it seemed as if they were all, somehow, part of  himself, and he was part of them, and them and himself were free from the  drag of his body that had aches and dirty thoughts, and got sick, and could  only be in one place at a time....&quot;<br />The next, they are romantic:  &quot;They sat. Studs swinging his legs, and Lucy swinging hers, she  chattering, himself not listening to it, only know it was nice, and that  she laughed and talked and was like an angel, and she was an angel playing  in the sun.&quot; Then, the next instant &quot;Suddenly, he thought of  feeling her up, and he told himself that he was a bastard for having such  thoughts...&quot;<br />It is, for me at least, intensely evocative of my inner  experience when I was that age. The passage is tragic, too. &quot;Time  passed through their afternoon like a gentle, tender wind, and like death  that was silent and cruel. They knew they ought to go, and they sat.&quot;  It is the only time Studs is with Lucy. She is his great lost love--like  the little red-haired girl in Charles Shultz's _Peanuts_--and he is haunted  by her throughout the rest of the trilogy.<br />I love Farrell's dialogue, the  way his characters say dull, stupid things that ring true. Part of  Farrell's technique involves hearing similar words and opinions echoing  from character to character. I can't think of any other writer who does  this. Studs' smooth-talking friend Ike touts him into buying stock:  &quot;Fellows, I'm not kidding. Listen, I work for Imbray and I know. You  know what's behind these stocks? Well, I'll tell you. All, or nearly all,  the public utilities of the Middle West and the brain of a man like Solomon  Imbray. What more security could you want?&quot; A few chapters later, he  has lost half his money and is unable to make his father a loan. His father  says &quot;God, Bill! Imbray stock is as shaky as a reed in the wind,&quot;  and poor Studs says, lamely: &quot;I thought that since it is based on  public utilities, and with a smart man like Solomon Imbray controlling it,  it would be safe.&quot;<br />Incidentally, _Studs Lonigan_ is wonderful for  reading aloud.	2000-07-29

(In Amazon, type in Dyer as &quot;author&quot; and &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; as title.  Click on the  paperback link, and ignore the part that says it hasn't been  published).<br />The elegant Library of America edition of &quot;London:  Novels and Stories&quot; has three complete novels _The Call of the Wild_,  _White Fang_, _The Sea-Wolf_, and a very well chosen selection of stories.  It's great.  Viking's _The Portable Jack London_, is cheap and excellent;  it's edited by Earle Labor, has _The Call of the Wild_, and an excellent  selection of short stories, nonfiction, and letters.  If you want copies of  _The Call of the Wild_ to give to LOTS of friends, the Dover Thrift Edition  is just a buck.<br />But if you want _just_ The Call of the Wild, Dyer's  edition is nice enough to give as a gift, is clear and legible, and has  just the right amount of pictures and annotations.  Not a scholarly work,  but every time you get to one of those places where you have a  question--where was Dyea? What was the &quot;Chinese lottery?&quot; Could a  dog really pull a thousand pound sled? there's Dyer with the answer.<br />And  if you're interested in Jack London, take a look at the  alt.books.jack-london Internet discussion group--see &quot;about me&quot;  for details.	2000-07-21

Buy it to thumb through at the same time as you read any other biography.  This is like a lovingly assembled scrapbook.  It is extremely rich in material;  there must be, oh, an average of three photographs or pictures on each of  its 276 pages.<br /> Kingman seems to have found photographs of just about  every place Jack London ever lived or worked and just about every person  that figured in Jack London's life.  How about... Johnny Heinold, owner of  the &quot;First and Last Chance Saloon?&quot; here on p. 38; the schooner  &quot;Sophia Sutherland&quot; on p. 43; here's Jack in Kelly's Army; here's  the Erie County Penitentiary where he spent a month... here's George  Sterling, here's Anna Strunsky, here's Cloudesley Johns... Here are  pictures of Jack as a young sailor, Jack in the Klondyke, Jack at the  Bohemian Grove, Jack on the farm... <br /> This is a &quot;pictorial  biography&quot; and the interest is in the pictures. The writing isn't  inspired, but it is useful as a detailed outline of the events of Jack  London's life. It has a useful bibliography.<br />	2000-06-12

The dialog is like Heinlein and E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith at their awkward worst, and that's not intended as a compliment. Here's a  sample:<br /> <br /><br />Vanderheld stirred, pulled himself erect.<br /><br />&quot;One  thing more. While I'm rotting in hell, Mr. President, I'll at least be  warm. Did you think we in the January Group would leave this to chance?  _Columbia's_ mission is doomed, has been from the moment it lifted off.  There will be no test of the fusion reactor.  And did you really think the  Middle East leaders are going berserk on their own? Elements of the January  Group control them. But you can save yourself and get everything back to  normal. Immediately denounce fusion.&quot; <br /> The President blanched.  &quot;I can't&quot;<br /> <br /> Vanderheld sneered. &quot;Then you've sealed  your own fate and that of this country.... Now I can say what I've always  believed: it will be a great day for the world when this country gets a  boot shoved in its face, is made to kneel before the people of the  world.&quot; <br /> Edwards shook his head. &quot;You're a traitor, always  have been.&quot; <br />	2000-05-06

How could _you_  use them somehow to earn $40,000 in one summer?<br /> The incredible  combination of whimsical fantasy and prosaic down-to-earth realism... the  incredible story that sort of rambles in a picaresque way... wonderful for  reading aloud because every chapter stands on its own, but a page-turner  all the same... and an almost unique blending of illustration and story.   It is NOT an illustrated story; it is NOT a series of captioned pictures;  the two work together.<br /> And I didn't even tell you about the game of  follow-the-leader, with Peter trying to shake off his followers by taking  them to various risky places (with dramatic point-of-view perspective  illustrations from the top of a suspension bridge...)

(Its appearance this time is so contrived that I actually am  starting to wonder whether it is some sort of game she is playing.)<br /> I am  in the process of forming a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to  Barbara Havers.  And Elizabeth George is _terribly_ cruel to poor Barbara  in this novel.  I can remain impassive as I read the passages that deal  with murder, suicide, sadomasochism--even the explanation of how that  mysterious shiny metal cylinder is supposed to be used. (Well,  &lt;shudder&gt;, fairly impassive, anyway). (And Ms. George looks so  diffident and demure in her dustjacket photo!) But, omigod, the things that  happen to Barbara--they're (sob) just TOO much to bear.  The things that  happen in her personal and professional relationship with Lynley... and  just when that seems to be getting straightened out at last, she gets hit  with something else from an entirely different quarter when--no, no, I  can't bear to talk about it.<br />	1999-09-30

And although it is a well-constructed play,  I am surprised that others see it as having more substance than, say, a  really first-rate television sitcom...<br /> The movie version is available in  video cassette, and, to the best of my recollection (hey, I was eight years  old at the time) reasonably faithful to the stage version. With, of course,  the addition of the wonderful Sammy Cahn title song, which has probably  done as much as anything to keep the play's memory alive.<br /> I would be  interested in having the previous reviewer contact me.

It was deserted and full of cracks and corners, another  of the places where I expected to find a corpse, a murder victim, a  suicide, or more likely someone who had been accidentally drowned and  washed ashore.  I had never had this spooky feeling in a wild country, in  Asia or Africa, but on the British coast, whenever I was in a lonely place,  I looked down and expected to see a dead man.&quot;<br /> Theroux takes you on  an interesting trip, but he is an awfully crabby companion.	1999-02-19

For me, the best  thing about _this_ one is most of his other novels evidently are _romans a  clef_.  Well, this novel has the keys.<br /> The protagonist of this novel,  Gus Bailey, is a writer of novels entitled &quot;An Inconvenient  Woman,&quot; &quot;A Season in Purgatory,&quot; &quot;The Two Mrs.  Grenvilles,&quot; etc.  From time to time Dunne will say things like  &quot;_An Inconvenient Woman_ was about the murder of the mistress of Jules  Mendelson, the billionare friend of the President of the United  States.&quot; So if, like me, you were so out of it that you didn't know  that these earlier books were really about Jules Mendelson or Betsy  Bloomingdale or whatever, and if, UNLIKE me, it means something to you when  you find out, this is the book for you...<br /> But it's not much of a  _novel_.  What you really think of it probably depends mostly on what you  think about the O. J. Simpson trial.  Many will find that Dominick Dunne  speaks for them.  Dunne evidently believes LAPD racism was a nonissue, and  was just a transparent pretext used by a racist Johnnie Cochran to give a  racist jury a fig leaf to cover a racist verdict. Those who agree with  Dunne will enjoy this book more than those who do not.	1998-09-20

I _want_ to tell my kids about Kennedy, about Vietnam, about the McCarthy era.  I hear myself talking and I know it sounds just as boring as it was to me hearing my folks talking about Roosevelt, or the Depression, or the World's Fair. <br /> This book is fascinating and moving and it has important things to say.  Gelernter is trying, with honesty and intelligence, to explore the question &quot;What was it really like for our folks?&quot; How can anyone _really_ know?  Nobody can, but for a time as recent as 1939 it's well worth trying. <br /> I did go to the, was it 1963, New York World's Fair. My mother said I just _had_ to, even though everybody said it was a pale shadow of the 1939 fair.  I remember an IBM exhibit done by Charles Eames, featuring twelve movie screens and simultaneous shots from twelve viewpoints of, say, two train cars coupling (one closeup, one aerial, one of the dispatchers board) while the narrator said something stupid and shallow about data and information.  I remember that the Coca-Cola pavilion smelled of Coke.  It wasn't like 1939. <br /> About once a chapter something pulls you up short.  Sometimes it's a trivial detail (&quot;those tractor trains at the Bronx Zoo whose horns played &quot;Boys and Girls Together&quot; were from the Fair.&quot;)  Other times it's not so trivial. <br /> William Manchester tried something like this in &quot;The Glory and the Dream.&quot; Let's see, was it David Halberstam who recently wrote &quot;The Fifties?&quot;  Gelernter's book is more readable, and more profound.	1998-03-22

The thing I love about Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is that he convinces me that he is not being whimsical, and that he is not making it up as he goes along. For me, &quot;Lives of the Monster Dogs&quot;  has the same quality.<br /> I found it convincing.  The city of Rankstadt, the dogs' opera, the genuinely horrifying depiction of the young Augustus Rank--I think these will stick in my mind forever.<br /> It does not surprise me at all that the book does not work for everybody.  And, yes, I thought the ending was weak.<br />Still, I wish Cleo and Lydia the best.  I hope that Ludwig will meet &quot;I, Claudius&quot; in some literary Valhalla; I believe they would like each other.  And I will certainly look for the ruins of Neuhundstein the next time I find myself in New York City after 2011.<br /> Is it just my imagination, or does something about the expression and bearing of the author, as shown  on the back flap of the cover, resemble that of the monster dog on the front cover?	1997-10-17

Recently I've been struggling with C++ STL, trying to use the &quot;map&quot; container to get perhaps a tenth of the functionality you get from an ordinary M variable, and, believe me, I miss M.   <br /> This is the M book we've all been waiting for, and it delivers exactly what it promises.   It is, as the blurb says, &quot;the only source  M programmers at all levels need.&quot;   <br /> The style and presentation reminds me a little of Stoustrup's book on C++: the organization and style are tutorial, but not elementary.  It is up-to-date with the current standard.   <br /> What I particularly admire about it, and what is all too rare in computer books (especially those written by professors of computer science) is that it displays an intelligent awareness of real-world commercial implementations of M.  Too many books either describe a pure-standards abstraction on the one hand, or a specific vendor extension on the other.  Walters identifies popular M implementations by name and calls attention to variations where appropriate.  Like M itself, Walters' book is directed at real programmers trying to solve real problems in the real world. <br />  There are a few places where one can see that the book is an (extensive) rewrite of his older book, rather than a completely new work.  I thought it was harder to locate the &quot;argumentless DO&quot; than it should have been, and I felt there should have been a coherent discussion in one place explaining the (historically weird) relations between the various forms of DO, and when $T is and isn't stacked. Similarly, it is disconcerting to see on page 199 that the &quot;NEW&quot; command is described as a &quot;recent extension... not yet formally included in the standard.&quot;  These are cosmetic problems that do not seriously mar the book I've been waiting for.	1997-10-06

Over and over it tied together and made sense of things that had puzzled me. <br /> To get personal: in the fifties, my father spent a small fortune on traditional Freudian psychoanalysis.  And it did him a lot of good. For years, I believed Freudian psycyoanalysis was scientific.  For one things, it just _had_ to be. No charlatan could go to the effort and expense of getting an MD, then board certification in psychiatry, then undergo psychoanalysis, just in order to con people. <br /> Yet in some way that I didn't quite understand, I became aware than nowadays Freudian psychoanalysis is considered to be a pseudoscience, on about the same level as orgone boxes or homeopathy or Christian science. <br /> How _could_ my parents have fallen for it? How _could_ the medical community? <br /> Well, Shorter explains what happened in a way that makes sense, seems clear, and (to my mind) is really  quite sympathetic to the psychoanalytic community and its clients. <br /> Along the way he ties up a lot of loose ends.  All through the book I kept saying to myself things like, &quot;Oh, so _that's_ what 'neurasthenia' was&quot; (people in novels written early in the century often had it).  &quot;Wow, so that's what the word 'degenerate' is really referring to.&quot;	1997-10-06

When I saw a new one, &quot;In the Presence of the Enemy,&quot; I grabbed it.  Only this time I got my wife to read it.  Well, she hasn't read any of the others, which I had already thrown out or given away.  And she thought it was so great, she _insisted_ I get the others, so I went back to the bookstore and bought the other six paperbacks, and we both read our way through them, she for the first time and me for the second... and we both loved all of them.  And then, dammit, we found out there's this new one in hardbound.  I _never_ buy hardbounds.  But with the momentum worked up from reading seven paperbacks, well, we just _had to_...<br />  This one is just Barbara Havers, without Lynley, Lady Helen, St. James, or Deborah.  I have suggested the formation of a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Barbara Havers, but this time, for once, she avoids major emotional trauma.  (Well, there's an event at the end of the book which may have ruined her career... we won't know until the next book I guess... but that's relatively minor compared to some of the things she's suffered).<br />  The story revolves around the Pakistani community in a seaside resort town, race relations, and Islam.  Wonderful local color, the usual mixture of real characters you care about and comic-strip characters you love to hate...<br />   The following remarks should be read only by other Elizabeth George fans.  I love her novels.  I hope it is OK to tease just a little.<br />   Here are the infallible signs by which you may know that this is a genuine Elizabeth George novel<br />   1) The word &quot;secateurs&quot; appears in it.  I believe this word appears in every one of her novels.  Sooner or later, _someone_ is going to pop up in a garden with a pair of secateurs.  I had almost lost hope when I had read five hundred pages with no secateurs in sight, but, fortunately, they emerged on page 520.<br />   2) There is always at least one really obscure word that I have to look up in the dictionary.  This time, I didn't even _find_ it.  So if anyone knows what a &quot;pilgarlic&quot; is (p. 498) I'd appreciate it if they'd let me know.<br />   3) And, of course, in every Elizabeth George novel, sooner or later someone is going to refer in some way to &quot;the scent of sex&quot; (in this case, on page 144).	1997-07-20

If you've never read any of Elizabeth George's novels, this is as good a place as any to start. By the way, she writes novels, not just &quot;mystery novels.&quot;<br />  This book works as a novel, as a mystery, as a puzzle, as a soap opera, as a sheer entertainment page-turner, and as a travelogue.  You get a lot of bang for your reading buck.<br />  Poor, poor Barbara Havers... I think there should be a society for the prevention of cruelty to characters.  I feel so sorry for her.<br />   Fantastic (in both senses of the word) plot twists.<br />   As it happens, I am extremely dense about guessing whodunnit. I just read mysteries for the atmosphere, the characters, the story, the procedure, and the background.  But Elizabeth George has pulled off what for me is a very rare experience--I didn't guess whodunnit, but at the end I actually feel that I ought have been able to.<br />	1997-06-07

Recently, the Oakland, CA school board created a national controversy about a plan that included the use of &quot;Ebonics&quot; (Black English) in the classroom.  This made me remember a book I had read way back in the sixties, Robert Gover's &quot;The One Hundred Dollar Misunderstanding.&quot; (I think the title had a &quot;The&quot; on it then; it doesn't now; but it's definitely the same book).<br />I remembered thinking it was a great book then.  I was pleased to find that it's still in print, so I ordered it. I still think it's a great book.<br />In college, while taking an anthropology course, I noticed a pattern: outside linguists and anthropologists would insist that something spoken somewhere was a true language, with distinct grammar and vocabulary rules; yet the local dominant culture would always maintain that it was merely a bad or ungrammatical or corrupt form of whatever THEY happened to speak.  <br />Wonder of wonders, I made the connection: all those years, I suddenly realized, my parents' colored maid (sorry, that's the way we referred to her) had NOT been speaking _bad_ English; she had been speaking a different _kind_ of English from the English I spoke. Then I read Gover's book, and the lesson sunk in more. I became able to hear certain words, when spoken by Negroes/Blacks/African-Americans, not as having an irritating mispronunciation, but as having a _variant_ pronunciation. Apart from the little matter of the social class which it was associated, it was no less valid than the &quot;Harvard accent&quot; which could still be heard in sixties Cambridge.<br />Well, anyway...I think it's a wonderful book.  (I don't know how it might strike an African-American. As I write this I sound uncomfortably to myself like the contemptible character in the novel, James Cartwright Holland)	1997-03-01

All the ethical questions about it remain.  And, particularly   when the figures are so identifiable, I find the details of some of   the episodes disturbing.  Klein knows perfectly well that we're   all going to wonder whether &quot;Stanton's&quot; real-life counterpart could   _really_ have done something like _that_.<br />   Nevertheless, this is a fine novel.  It works very well _as a novel_.  In fact,   I enjoyed it every bit as much as Edwin O'Connor's &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot;   and I would put the two books in the same category.<br />   Thirty years from now, when the Clintons are as vague a memory as Curley is   today, I think people will still be reading this novel for its   value as a slice of late-twentieth-century life.<br />   But I still want to know: do they really call the press &quot;scorps&quot;   or did Joe Klein just make that up?	1996-11-09
