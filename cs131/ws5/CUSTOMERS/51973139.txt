This is not the type of book I would normally read but from reading the first paragraph, I admit that I got hooked on it.   <br /> <br />    There are 2 main stories that he tells; the story of his studies of the baboons, and the story of his times in Africa.  Mr. Sopalsky's self-deprecating humor about his trials and tribulations of a suburban raised male trying to make it in the bush of Africa is hilarious.  As his book states, he was \\"raised in New York, around the big city\\" and \\"had been camping in the Appalachians\\", so why wouldn't he be ready for the African bush?  His story unfolds over 20 years of studying the baboons and the story about his life there is just as interesting as his story of the baboons. <br /> <br />   As for the baboons, his way of telling the stories of his findings makes it feel like you are kind of a voyeur on some dysfunctional but in many ways normal group of people, maybe even a family.  He gives names to all of them and you he follows many from birth to death.  His findings, although maybe not groundbreaking, portray a very interesting view of these animals lives, social structure and dealings with each other.  As I alluded too earlier, many of these attributes are very human-like (or vice-versa).   <br /> <br />     If I could give this 4 1/2 stars I probably would.  Although I do not want to give the ending away of the book, it is pretty safe to say that with urban sprawl, the rise of tourism and the \\"westernization\\" of parts of Africa, that the animals and the land they live on are getting smaller, more polluted and more populated with humans.  His last chapter is a somber one when compared with the rest of the book.  I guess it is a dose of reality but in serving us that, he leaves us with questions of what ultimately happens to the baboons and his studies of them.  <br /> <br />     I would and have recommended this book to anyone who enjoys a good story.  It has some interesting scientific studies of the baboons that relateto humans, and better yet it has a great story of someone who moves to Africa and is sometimes it seems, just along for the ride, whether with baboons or with caffeine addicted truck drivers driving across the continent.  It is a very enjoyable and educational read. <br />	2005-08-04

If Stephen Ambrose is considered the person that captured the life and times of the military veterans experience during  WWII, then Evan Wright is probably in the forefront for capturing the experience of today's modern Marines.  This book follows Recon Marines through their dusty, grueling, long trek from the south of Iraq to Baghdad serving as somewhat of a diary of their daily lives.  Wright captures the culture that these Marines were raised through the building of the characters he writes about in the same way Ambrose was able to in \\"Band of Brothers\\".  The men in first Recon for the most part seem pretty desensitized to the fact that they are killing, no doubt brought about by the type of entertainment offered today, although some do think about the consequences both for the Iraqi's and themselves.  Wright does a great job in building the personalities no matter how unflattering some may be (he gives most of the unflattering ones code names that the men have assigned) and he is able to capture the instances that cause most of the frustrations for the men regarding some of their seemingly clueless and wreckless \\"leaders\\".  As in most things in life, many times it is the led that should be leading the leaders.  Obviously many of these men are pretty young and the writing does an excellent job in detailing the viewpoints, feelings and worries  of this generation (a rumor circulates that J Lo was killed), especially in regards to killing, the war and their place in it.  There seems to be more cynicism than ideology present in many of them.  First glance at the title led me to believe that this book was just going to be a very shallow account of war with nothing but shoot-outs and foul language, but in reading it, the foul language and the title fits very well regarding the culture that these Marines were raised and are a part of.  This is a great diary of ground troops in the Gulf War II and should be added to any military library.	2005-04-29

This book is a collection of essays written in the weeks after 9/11.  His viewpoints on this new warfront are very well thought out, researched and for the most part based on history, not just of battles and wars, but cultures as well.  In short, he seem's to see this war in somewhat simplistic terms of \\"us or them\\" and \\"do or die\\" where pacifism, denial, and self-blame (\\"we brought this on ourselves because of our foriegn policy, etc.\\") could be the terrorists biggest weapon, ultimately giving them the upper hand.  Some may feel his views are cold or callous but taking into a military historians account, war itself is cold and callous.  In a true war between 2 cultures, there is often no room for taking into account the other sides \\"feelings\\", especially when they are so hell-bent on destroying you.  His views are hard to argue with because  many are based on historical facts that have time and time again proven true.  And although these are in fact new times in a more advanced civilization, the motives, beliefs and desires for the most part remain the same (they want to kill us - for various reasons - and we want to live).  He does a great job in laying out his case for an offensive and aggressive response to America's \\"new\\" enemies.	2005-04-28

These are the smartest of the smart from MIT, and although we may be able to pull the wool over the eyes some of our friends in the local game, to do it on this level is something totally different.  How they worked on it and practiced is part of the story that makes it great.  This is a great book on how some \\"nerds\\" took Vegas and other casino's for millions.  You probably know that if you are looking at this review so I will just tell you that the story and how it is told is great, from the way they were recruited to the reasons some of them left.  It is a roller coaster ride from the high's of winning (strapping tens of thousands of dollars to their body in order to fly) to the low's of winning (being followed, having their home broken into, etc.) and everything in between (having to wear disguises to play in the casino's).  It is a great story and at the end it leaves you asking, when is the next book coming out on those that actually decided to remain \\"in the game\\".	2005-04-28

This book is based on the Brady text and like most review books, it hits on the most archane details that when taking in such a large subject, unless you just read it, you probably would not remember it.

I took some different tests and for the most part if you study and know basic math, have some basic mechanical aptitude, etc., you should do fine.  While Norman Hall's book is definitely more advanced in terms of the mechanic's and math, this is generally in line with what I saw on the test's.  Not knowing what is going to be on the test though, I believe that the more info you have, the better, so I would buy both.  If it moves you on to the next step, it was worth it.	2005-04-28

I bought this book along with the Barron's book and the combo of the 2 worked well I think (I ended up with a job where I wanted). The reason I gave this only 4 stars instead of 5 is that I took 3 tests and did not see any mechanical aptitude or math questions as advanced on the tests as some of those in the book.  I spent a lot of time memorizing formula's that unless you were a mechanical engineer, I have know idea who would know this stuff off the top of their head (questions regarding force on a certain length lever over a certain distance or others related to force and distance regarding the pitch of a screw).  Some of the math too seemed a little advanced for what I saw on the tests.  I would suggest buying both books though, because it may give you a happy medium of which to study from.

If you work in EMS and reading the textbooks on patient assessment, etc. gets a little dry, this book can help with getting the idea of assessments down.  It is somewhat short and concise, and lays out the assessments in storyline format.  The assessments in the stories are common ones most scene in the field (chest pain, syncope, etc.).  The protocols used on the calls are also general and may differ from your area.  Again, the main idea is forming a general impression, asking questions and picking up the signs and symptoms the patients may be exhibiting.<br />My 2 main problems with the book are the price (it's pretty expensive for such a short book), and the fact that the author writes about some &quot;Jerry Donnely&quot; like a religious follower writing about their God.  It gets to be a little much at some points,... Actually it gets to be too much at some points.<br />If you get past that and get the book used (for cheaper), it can be a good book to break up the monotony of reading textbooks on the subject.	2004-04-18

When I first got this book, it looked shorter than I expected.  Don't be fooled by its lightweight though.  It is packed with a lot of information and it takes time to read and really absorb the ideas and facts presented in the book.  Mr. Loewen's ideas on the dismall performance of American students knowing their own country's history is about right on.  I definitely was not a history buff in high school and I think the reasoning may be partly that what we are taught is only meant for short term memory for upcoming tests.  It's focus seems to be remembering dates and facts about things and people that many students see no connection to in their lives or history.  I think his argument that the fact there is little or no debate in the classes regarding controversial issues keeps the students from getting engaged in their classes.    <br />I got the book for the historical facts in it and I was not disappointed.  About 20% of the book talks about the history textbooks at the high school level.  Many of the examples in the book only strengthen his argument that students are not being challenged to think for themselves and that pieces of history that have really no bearing on anything significant receive as much paper and time as more important and recent historical happenings (such as the Civil Rights Movement).  For my taste, there was too much emphasis on the textbooks.  I just wanted a more complete history lesson on the subjects in the book, not a detailed comparison of each of his 12 textbook examples.  Still I gave the book 4 stars due to the subjects covered and the facts regarding them.  <br />This is a great book for American history buffs and is a good compliment to Howard Zinn's &quot;A People's History of the United States&quot;.	2003-11-07

In a sense that is true, however there are some major differences.  Only a few the chapters in the book deal with actual soldiers doing armed combat in a somewhat organized fashion.  Most of the chapters deal with war from another perspective.  The book highlights the lengths that some reporters go to to report \\"the story\\".  Most of the stories in the book are not so much about traditional armies doing battle on battlefields, but tell the story of those who live on battlefields with no defined borders.  The stories told here are not for the meek.  They are horror stories of the worst kind, they happened (and are still happening).  Families watching family members tortured, raped and/or killed.  Children being coerced into murdering others to save their own lives.  Prisoners being humiliated for the shear amusement of their captors only to be slowly killed in the end.  \\"War IS Hell\\", is the only thought that kept crossing my mind.  The stories ar vivid and move fast, and do not leave a romanticized vision of war in your mind that many movies or books do.  The stories take place all over the world and range from military atrocities to civilians in Chechnya, to genocide and the killing of 800,000 people in 4 months in Rwanda, to US soldiers dealing with the fact that they killed Iraqi civilians in the heat of battle.  These stories were not written in a cushy office with survivors sitting on a couch telling there story.  These were written in real time, with the reporter in the dirt, standing on bodies in some cases, living the stories and putting their own lives at risk.  Some were even bold enough to seek out and interview the perpetrators of the crimes, and in some cases be witnesses to them.<br />One may ask, why read this then?  This book will not be for everyone, but for those who read it, it will be an educational tool used to remind them of the true and sometimes unseen costs of war.  Also, that there are truly evil people in the world and war (violence) may be the only way to be rid of them (think Hitler).  International tribunals for war crimes has not been a factor in dealing with many of these war criminals.  It is also a reminder of the the sacrifices made by the soldier who is sent in the name of good, to do the deeds necessary to eradicate evil. <br />There are many stories in here and each chapter/article is unique in its outlook, writing and ideas.  This book is a must for anyone interested in history related to the military or war itself.	2003-11-06

The book focuses on Odessa, a town in Texas that revolves around its high school football team.  From playing high school football, the name Permian was a familiar one due to its prominence for fielding great teams.  The players had(and this was in back around 1990)luxuries available to them that most colleges still do not have today, a stadium built for thousands of people with the capacity to sit almost their entire town, the UT Longhorn college band which plays at their games, and their players are elevated to the status of heroes during the season.  <br />There is two stories told though.  One the story of the towns unwavering support for the team, and two, the story to those who aren't or can't play anymore.  It does follow a star player after he experiences a knee injury and is unable to play or perform again.  He is no longer a hero the book follows him as he slowly fades into obscurity.  You can see many of the kids banking everything on football and not anything else.  What awaits for many is a rude awakening (as it does for many other kids in high school) when they graduate or are injured and are not good enough for college or the pros and have nothing else to fall back on.  Many of these people are the people filling the stands in Permian, working in the oil fields, lining up for 2 days to get tickets to the games, and living vicariously through the new crop of players on the field.  <br />This is a great sports book that captures all the essence of sports; the winners, the losers, injured, the fans and families and the town.  The ironic thing is that Odessa and Permian High School's greatest strength may also be its greatest weakness; that the town and its people seem to live for and depend so much on Permian football.	2003-10-22

This would probably be a 3 or 3.5 stars on most other authors scale but on a Clancy scale, only a 2.  The book starts out good with the story of the terrorists but the character development for the main characters (Jack Jr. and the Caruso brothers) is weak.  The story seems hurried and quickly put together and the \\"missions\\" and how long they take to put together seems half-hazard, the type of stuff usually scene on weekly TV cop shows.  The book is short by Clancy standards and this may be one of its faults.  Clancy fans are used to high tech, high action, and highly detailed writing that draws them into the story.  I read them for the stories but usually feel that I walk away with a better understanding of something, whether it be militarily, politically, or foriegn policy wise.  From this book, I walked away with nothing but a question, \\"Did Clancy really write this?\\"<br />Not a good choice for true Clancy fans.	2003-09-20

Although I was not born yet, I believe this book is important in educating those of us too young to know the real history of the problems in the Middle East.<br />The book is about the 1972 Olympic hostage crisis, where most of the Israeli delegation were taken hostage and subsequently killed by a Palestinian group calling themselves Black September (named so because of a battle in which many Palestians were killed by Israeli's in September 1967).<br />Mr. Reeves has done an excellent job in researching this book, to the point that one is amazed at the almost keystone cop-like appoach made by many German officials in dealing with this problem. Obviously, they (the Germans) were facing an uphill battle dealing with a fanatical terrorist group, all in front of a worldwide audience expecting to watch sporting events pitting country against country. This said, the mistakes are many and made by many different people. In the book, there are the \\"hawks\\" and there are the \\"doves\\", then there are the Israeli's on foriegn soil trying to get their countrymen safely back home. Mr. Reeves does a great job on the background of the terrorists, giving the personal reasons for (but not justifying) the actions that they took. Great detail is given to the debacle at the airport where everyone was killed. Many questions are raised about what went down there, such as why none of the snipers were given walkie talkies to communicate with one another allowing them to discern who was going to take down who? It was this situation geon awry that made the Germans create GSG-9, their counter-terrorism unit. Mr. Reeves also touched on Operation \\"Wrath of God\\". the Isreali revenge mission to assassinate surviving members of the group. This part of the book is just as fascinating and reads like a novel. It shows the resolve of the Isreali's to seek revenge on those who did them wrong. They had there own problems though when they assassinated a suspected member of Black September, who turned out to be an innocent waiter.<br />All in all, the book is not \\"enjoyable\\" but is an important piece of history. ... I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of Middle East conflict and/or terrorism.	2003-03-18

Mr. Gup has done an incredible job on the putting together the lives and missions of some of America's unknown and unsung heroes.  <br />This is not a Clany-esque book by any means.  What this is is a collection of biographies of some of the men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice for the CIA and USA.  It is an in-depth view at the types of character it takes to work a thankless job in remote, hostile and harsh environments.  It talks of the resolve (to the point of stubborness) of some men who faced life in a foriegn prison, rather than admit they were a spy (and subsequently be released back to the US - something happening to others around them).  <br />Although some of the people died in random acts of violence that did not specifically target them, they are still powerful and moving stories of their lives surrounding service, and the families they left behind.  He chronicles some of the stories of the families who suffering immense loss, were lied to or had information with held from them in the name of \\"national security\\".  Not even in death could the truth come out about many of these people.  The irony is, there are many cases for national security.  However, there seems to be no time frame for the grieving for when they may find out the truth (some waiting more than 30 years), or be able to celebrate the fact that deceased died for America rather than for a dummy corporation as a \\"civilian employee\\".<br />Overall, this is a humbling book that proves no matter how trivial some of the work may seem, no matter how much information is received on \\"America's interests\\", the true value of that work and that information can be very costly.	2003-02-27

Mr. Rosenberg has put together a believable scenario regarding a big \\"what if\\".  The story being, what if America lets Saddam roam free in his own land building weapons of mass destruction.  For the complexity that this situation would bring, the book is very short and lacking in many key areas.  <br />The biggest area is character development.  He introduces some very colorful characters, but leaves the reader wondering about their backgrounds and motivations.  One example is of the \\"Four Horseman\\".  They turn out to be a integral part of the story, but why?  Other than the fact that they are the most wanted terrorists in the world, but for what?  Why are they so evil?  What have they done and why should they be tracked more than others?  Another is the traitor in the Presidents ranks.  The background on his \\"backstabbing\\" of not just the President but the country as well, deserves more than just the few pages it took up.<br />My other big problem with the story, was why is John Bennett the main character?  Other than him being an economic genious, he has no political background to broker such an important deal in the middle of a nuclear crisis.  I can see Mr. Rosenberg working this angle, but it does not work for me.<br />There are some great parts to the book too.  The airport scene involving Bennett is great as is the war room scenes with the President, etc.  The opening attack is also very good.<br />Overall, an entertaining book that only scratched the surface on what could be a great story (or an unfortunate outcome).	2003-02-11
US	51973139	R1IUCN3TOQ5RG6	0425170349	626650351	Rainbow Six (John Clark Novel, A)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A new direction for Clancy and well worth it.	Basically the book is about a team Mr. Clark has put together of the best-of-the-best counter terrorist specialists.  Clancy's description and character building are exceptional along with the fact that this is an action novel (which rarely give you much in terms of character development).  The book is long, but very enjoyable due to the story of the building of the team and their first operations.  Just because this novel does not take place in the halls of politics or on a warship, his knack for technical and political story telling is not missed.  This is a great addition not just to a Clancy library, but a military library as well, due to his knowledge of the subjects he writes about.  I can't wait until the follow up to the Rainbow Six.	2003-01-09

He is usually leaning to the right side of a problem.  Although I may not agree with some of his statements (although I agree with most of them), one has to give him credit for having studied the facts and giving pointed well thought out arguments for his ideas.  One has to admire the way in which he has ducked any issue and all though his show is not a totally level playing field (it is his show), he at least asks the hard questions that most people want answered.  His book is the same way, offering his ideas on current issues in a manner that is easy to understand, thought provoking, and sometimes frustrating to read.  What's more refreshing is he actually seems to want dissenting viewpoints to discuss, rather than easy, yes-men type interviews.  Good job Mr. O'Reilly on transforming the way we expect to hear about current issues.	2003-01-09

Great stories from a group of skilled and dedicated soldiers told in the only way they know how, with honesty, brutality and in some cases a sense of humor.  This is a fast read that kept me enthralled because of the pace of the book.  The stories are long enough to give you some detail and the situations and short enough that there are no lapses of boredom.  It is a great book for non-fiction action of some of great warriors who really loved what they were doing.	2003-01-09

Mr. Douglas has done an excellent job bringing the lay-person into the world of FBI profiling.  He has succeeded at giving the reader enough knowledge about his profession and techniques that the average Joe may feel like they can go to a crime seen and tell who-done-it.  Profiling is clearly a complicated science but the author is able to talk about his experiences and knowledge of certain cases in a way that those not familiar with investigation will be able to understand.  Making this a better book is the way he is able to bring the reader into the investigation, by bringing them to the crime scene, seeing the body, etc. through his descriptions.  This is must read for anyone interested in crime, investigation or detective work.	2003-01-09

One would be hard pressed to find one with the resume of \\"Reverend\\" Jesse Jackson.  A brief synopsis of this book includes; the small lies (the Reverend Martin Luther King \\"dying in his lap\\" and him being the last person he spoke to), the big lies (his repeated shakedown of businesses for money to benefit minorities, when in actuality, the money is lining only his and his friends pockets), the ridiculous (he claims to be a Reverend yet he quit seminary school after a couple of months), the unbelievable (that no one has been able to call him on having anti-American, pro-Communist members on his PUSH delegation much less as close associates, who have helped form the rhetoric he espouses), the absurd (his relationships and public backing of Arafat and Castro during times of heightened sensitivity due to their actions and views against the US and its allies), the gut-wrentching (at a rally of his 4 days after 9-11 in a big auditorium, he could not find any room for a single American flag but room for an oversized portrait of himself, adding that America's response so far is just \\"scapegoating\\").  <BR>     <BR>Mr. Timmerman has done everyone a service by exposing probably the biggest con-man in politics.  This book made me laugh and it made me mad, mad that someone like him can get so far on complete BS.  By fanning the flames of usually non-existant racism in busines, he has been able to stay afloat.  This book proves over and over that Jesse not just needs racism, but creates and promotes it because without it, there would be no place else to go.  There are too many details in this book to cover in a review (his half-brother and business partner serving multiple life terms in prison, his backing of a military dictatorship in Sierra Leone and Nigeria that butchers its children - yes its true, even his own infidelities), but it is definitely worth the read.  Mr. Timmerman should be commended for the job he has done.  <BR>     <BR>You may ask yourself why would you want to spend your time reading about someone like this as I did when I first started the book.  Because we need to educate ourselves on our enemies and after reading this book, you will find out the \\"Reverend\\" Jesse Jackson is an enemy of everything American.	2003-01-07

Clancy, unlike he does in his other books, focuses a lot on a love story which is the basis for the action in this book.  Although Mr. Clark's military skills are talked about in great description, it is not another military he ends up using them against.  His fight is against drug dealers and pimps, and the story is great.  One has to read it to understand because this is not the typical \\"love story\\", in fact it is a love story that you would think Clancy would write.  Kudo's to Clancy on his endeavor out of the normal military novel.  I hope we get more books focusing on Mr. Clark and his group, Rainbow Six (another great Clancy book).	2003-01-06

This book has everything in it about the most colorful character the mob has had since Al Capone (which wasn't necessarily a good thing).  It is a very detailed account of not just Gotti's world but the world of the FBI who was trying to bring him down, from dealing with lawyers, to wiretaps in homes, to wiretapping cars on the street, to dealing with members of the mob themselves (as when the FBI heard a hit order was put out on a couple agents, how SAIC Mowe went to Gotti's front door to confront him personally), etc.  If there is a drawback to this book, it is that some of the FBI details were a little long winded, and at some points seemed to slow the book down.  But better to err on the side of details than to leave a reader asking questions, which there weren't that many after reading this book.  On a sidebar note, it gives the reader an idea of how the cards are usually stacked against the good guys and the obstacles that they have to overcome to get the bad guys.	2002-12-17

Mr. Marcinko takes you on a wild ride known as his life from his humble upbringing to commanding one of the top counter-terrorist organizations in the world.  His no-holds-bar language gives you the feeling that he is talking to you, rather than you having the stories spoon fed to you through an editor.  The stories are memorable to say the least and they are all true (for what we know).  He seems like he was bred for this life (hopping and popping in some far off jungle) and America is definitely lucky to have him on our side.<BR>This is just one more book that shows people the dedication it takes to be the best in a world of over-achievers (special forces in the US military), and he wrote it in a very entertaining manner.

Chief Watson, who was first made known through Richard Marcinko's Rogue Warrior book now speaks of his experiences in the military, spanning 30 years of service in the Navy.  He vividly recounts dangerous operations and battle stories in the jungles of Vietnam that were routine to his group of Seals.  For fans of the Rogue Warror series, he gives his personal prospective of serving under or for Mr. Marcinko, a perspective that you can tell is rooted in respect.  No real surprises here for fans of military reading, just great stories, colorful characters and knowledge that America is lucky to have guys like this defending our country.	2002-12-17

It is definitely not a manuel on how to hack but his life story up to this point.  It was inspirational in the sense that his talents at hacking are not normally found coming from the type of environment he was raised in.  Although he could have gone in many different directions, it is apparent he took the lesson of his mother's drug use, and finally death from AIDS, very serious.  Serious enough to keep him on somewhat of a staight path (other than his hacking into sites).  What this does lack though are more complete descriptions of the hacks he accomplished as well as more descriptive characteristics of some of the hackers he has come in contact with (along with their exploits).  He writes about these good hackers he knows of but nothing about why they are so renowned.  His chapters with the blacked out words was frustrating in that they break the readers train of thought, and forces us to assume things with never knowing the answers.  He could have easily substituted the actual company and exploits with similar but unrelated examples.  The book also abruptly ends with his experiences of September 11th, but in the book jacket, it talks of him working in Japan and New York for a big company.  We hear nothing of this in the book, thus leaving us wondering where he actually ended up, what is he doing, and what's up with his martial arts career?  Don't go into the book with many expectations or you might be disappointed.	2002-11-21

In reading the book it was refreshing to believe that he was writing the book in his own voice (very personally with anger, vulgarity, and fast paced).  The book was inspirational to the point that here was this guy who had the chips stacked against him and although I don't think most people will just roll over and die at the news (most people do choose to fight the cancer), he not just survived but was able to rebuild himself to become the best at what he does.  He pays tribute to the other cancer patients he meets and vividly describes the battles he and everyone else has with the cancer, the treatments and the 'loss of self'.  He doesn't paint a pretty picture about anything that happens except in the network of patients, survivors and some healthcare professionals he mwt along the way.  Another refreshing aspect to the book that adds to its validity is his honesty about his roller-coaster of emotions, where at times he wanted to give up certain pursuits and had to rely on the strength of those around him to go on.  It is a strong dose of reality for everyone who reads it, and educates those of us fortunate not to have cancer on the debilitating effects on the body and soul it has.  The bike and racing is a side-bar story that just adds to the strength of character that many survivors have after they beat the disease, on their \\"new lease\\" on life.  This was a great and humbling book that I could not put down when I started it.	2002-11-21

Mr. McNab describes in detail, sometimes through humor, the ordeals he and his men suffered when captured by Iraquis in the Gulf War.  Other than the minor differences in British English and American English, his writing style is entertaining and easy to follow and understand.  This book should be required reading for all those who think that our war on terrorism and treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay is too harsh.	2002-11-19

This is a great follow up book that looks into his entire life from childhood through his service with the SAS.  The book as a whole is very entertaining because of the tone Mr. McNab takes (dry British humor).  He talks in great length about 'selection' in the SAS and his battles with the IRA and also how he ended up on the path to a military career.  Mr. McNab has great life experiences and he does not dissappoint in delivering them to the reader in this book.  This is a must-read for those interested in reading about the personalities and individual experiences of those in elite fighting forces.	2002-11-19

Chris Ryan was the only one in the group that did not get captured or killed and he describes in detail the arduous journey he had to make against incredible odds.  The odds were definitely stacked against him (the weather, the enemy on his tail, lack of food and water for a week) and all he relied on was his will power to push forward when giving up could have been a lot easier.  The book is short read but it definitely packs a lot of power interms of the depths of human determination to live.	2002-11-19

Mr. Weisel has done a superb job at bringing the reader into the story (the train ride, the camps, etc.)  He vividly describes the depths of human suffering, torture and evil.  This is a book that every kid in middle school should read so they understand what our freedom has cost and why.  His accounts of human suffering which turn not just Jew against Jew, but family members against family members are experiences that we, fortunately, can only have nightmares about.

Granted, if these stories are true, many details would have been purposely left out but the author could have easily added in more vivid accounts and feeling into the stories.

If you are looking for \\"spin\\" or BS, you won't find it here.  Mr. D'Souza has written a book that is packed with liberal vs. conservative arguments and laid out the conservative viewpoint with clear, thoughtful, and straight-forward writing.  Although the book is short, it does its job by clearly discussing a variety of topics in which liberals and conservative tend to disagree on.  You may not agree with some of his thoughts, but it is hard to argue with him on the same \\"playing field\\" without resorting to some kind of political- read childish- ploy to overcome or end the debate.  Although some of the issues covered have more gray areas in them than just the black-white arguments he lays out, it does level the playing field due to the extreme ideas and thoughts many liberals have i.e. on welfare, affirmative action, etc.  I agree with 95% of what is writing about, but I do know there is another side and would love for someone to write and educated and well thought out counter to this book.  If there is one, please let me know.  He also adds in a list of books that have influenced this book and his thoughts (something he did not do in \\"What So Great...\\").  Overall a great book that will give any conservative, young or old, the ammunition needed to counter liberal arguments, ploys and policies.	2002-11-06

This is a good book regarding how Mr. Chalker got into and lived in the Seals.  The drawback to it though is you know from reading the front cover he was part of Seal Team 6 (the Navy's elite counter-terrorist unit), therefore you expect to read more about them.  He did offer insights into their lifestyles and how the job forced them to live.  However, if you have read a lot of these books, the one thing you will look for them are actual \\"situations\\" to read about.  Even if you have to change the \\"names and places\\", just tell us the story.  Obviously with this being a relatively new group, many of the \\"stories\\" most likely remain classified.  If there are not that many stories, then shame on the government for not utilizing the resources of the best trained units in the world.  We all know there are places that they can be used.  Mr. Chalker has written a good book that provides insight into his life in service and he should be commended for it.	2002-11-06

He gives us a history on drugs in Colombia and then vivedly describes how one man basically bribed and terrorized all of Colombia through his sheer brutalness.  I knew of Pablo Escobar before I read the book, but did not know the extent to which he went to keep his power.  It wasn't until a couple of Americans got killed on a passenger plane that he had blown up that America got directly involved.  One has to wonder if he hadn't happened to kill the Americans, would he still be in power today?	2002-10-23

Mark Bowden has doen an incredible job of giving the reader a 360 degree view of the battles in Mogadishu, from the soldiers on the ground, to the Somalis they were fighting, to the \\"eyes in the sky\\" above.  His story telling brings the reader into the battles and shows the true nature of urban combat as well as the resolve, training and professionalism those on the ground had against overwhelming forces.  <br />A strong point to the book are the human faces these battles have.  The physical and emotional pain suffered during the battle by its participants.  It is not a pretty picture, but it shows the dedication they had to the \\"man next to them\\".  The story of the 2 Delta Force troopers, who knew of the odds against them, refusing to leave a stranded pilot behind jumping out of a helicopter into enemy fire is only one example.  There are many such stories in this book, as there may be in every battle of every war.  The difference here is the writing and reporting by the author.<br />For the government (i.e. - Clinton) not wanting to make too much of a presence with the use of armored troop vehicles that could have been used in our soldiers rescue, this sure did not end quietly...	2002-10-23

For obvious reasons, he cannot divulge in the stories too far so the 4 star rating is more the fault of his apparent circumstance of not being able to tell us the whole story.  The book is educational in the sense that you get an insiders account of what it takes to be in Delta Force.  A shocking relevation for some will be the authors appearance during his time in service (especially training).  He is not the Rambo looking type, but actually quite the opposite.  He wears glasses and looks like he weighs a buck twenty soaking wet.  The impression that this leaves is that training and being one of these elite warriors is more about strength of character and willpower than muscle or brawn.  Mr. Haney leaves a lasting impression that these people are not the thrill seeking yahoos you see in movies, but intelligent, hard-working, dedicated and very professional in their work.

The book is intelligently written and lays out the cold facts regarding many areas of social interest affecting us today, ranging from radical muslim fundamentists, to reparations, to why Americans are unpopulat in many French eyes.  He paints with a wide brush on many issues but he still lays out the facts in a witty and non-chalante way.  The book is educational in the sense that it provides some credence and factual information to many popular arguments today, albeit mostly on one side.  I believe he does make an honest attempt to portray the \\"other sides\\" of the issues he is writing about but it is evident where he stands on these issues.  I also believe though that if the \\"proof\\" he lays out in the book on varying subjects pointed another way, he would have no issue in portraying it with honesty and integrity.  The best thing about the book is that Mr. D'Souza is an educated immigrant who has first hand knowledge of most of the issues he writes about.  From his upbringing and background, he almost should have turned out to have quite the opposite points of view on many of these issues.  Can't wait to read his other books.	2002-10-22

Not because of Bowden's style but because the story is just page after page of a [person] who can't keep his mouth shut about his recent find.  It is a quick read, because there is not that much to the story.  Still, the story could have been summarized more or less in a lenghty magazine column.  One last thing, Joey Coyle is made out to be kind of a Robin Hood for how he was giving his money out.  From reading the book, I think he was more just someone seeking the attention of being \\"that guy\\" thus showing his generosity only to increase his fleeting moment of popularity.

His stories and experiences reveal how many of our  top agencies in the government work to attain certain goals that they have.  There is too much to write about for a simple review, from the Kennedy  assasinations, to his exploits at saving his  captured comrades in Vietnam,  to the smuggling of drugs inthe country by our governemnt, to Jonestown, to  the shooting of President Reagan.  His ideas toward the end of the book,  although I thought they were a little out there, are thought provoking and  worthy of discussion, especially if even half of his stories are true.	1999-01-22
