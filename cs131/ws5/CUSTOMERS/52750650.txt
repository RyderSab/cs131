Watch out for choice (B). It looks reasonable...but it doesn't quite work, since the author doesn't make such a definitive statement.<br /><br />HUH????? WHAT ABOUT ANSWER (C)?????<br /><br />When you go to their even-more-annoying web site, you can not find where they have bothered to publish any corrections.<br /><br />I'm sick of this nonsense from these books.

I like the way it is organized by state. Once you have a list of schools you should then go to the web for more information, but this is a great way to get that initial list put together. Alas, I could not get the CD to work - but that was probably just me!	2005-09-05

There is a consistent theme here of either \\"I LOVED it\\" or \\"this is simplistic nonsense.\\" <br /> <br />I am fully in the simplistic nonsense camp. Maybe you should decide what type of reviewers you are more likely to agree with - romance novel readers or, shall we say, higher-level, quality fiction readers. This book will only satisfy the most immature reader out there. I hate to be mean about it, but it really reads like something an overly starry eyed and ambitious high school freshman girl would write. It's very, very whimpy, and worse than that, very amateurish.	2005-09-01

It is an enjoyable read. The charactors are diverse, the settings rich, and the love story realistic. <br /> <br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ending is uninteresting. It's one of those endings that makes you feel like the author just wanted to be done with it, or was, perhaps, on top of a deadline, so she justs ended it.	2005-09-01

Maybe it is already outdated, I don't know, but it was nearly impossible to follow through the museums. And then if and when I did find the thing he was talking about I didn't care for the flip comments about the artwork. (I know he's trying to be funny,  but I would have appreciated some more basic information on things. I found myself trying to read museum cards just to find out how old some of the works were!) Also, it really gave no additional information over what was in the regular Rick Steves travel books but added just one more not particularly helpful book to the luggage.	2005-06-29

I found it almost as hit or miss as if I had randomly chosen restaurants. Unfortunately it seemed most were mediocre at best.

Most of the restaurants that we visited from here were just OK, not great. It still felt pretty hit or miss.

I found it to be the usual bigotry masked as Christianity. There is no balanced look at the issue and gay people are dealt with in what I think of as a distinctly un-Christian way that does not look at their essential humanity but only as abstract faulty products. If you want more right wing fake religiousity then read it.

A lot of the information is old and outdated. There is much better, and more unbiased information available on the various college forums. There is so much redundancy in this book that it makes you wonder if any real research was done (I mean, how many campuses are engulfed in Ambercromie and Fitch, or are rated by Playboy for this or that, or you should bring a warm jacket - DUH). They raved about my alma mater, SUNY-Binghamton, being a diverse student body. Oh please - 96% of the kids from the greater NYC area. They might be different colors or whatever, but they are not diverse. For another school, Alfred Univ, they talk about the frats. Alfred got rid of its frats in 2002. Those are just a couple of the examples of poor information.	2004-07-26

While everyone raves on and on about the food element of it, I found I couldn't get past the disgusting ending of it.

Really, what could you learn from someone who thinks it is fascinating to watch her supposedly beloved dog cross the Alewife Parkway in Cambridge -- repeatedly! As she revels in allowing her &quot;dogs to be dogs&quot; all I could think about was: imagine being her neighbor! (which she does, in fact, imply is pure hell). Maybe if she had learned something interesting from her supposed research you could argue it was worthwhile, although I personally have trouble with the idea of potentially sacrificing great dogs to senseless research. Everything she finds enlightening has already been (better) researched and basically comes straight out of wolf research. Send in the humane society (the dog catcher has already called -- several times)!	2003-08-27

( I probably should read these reviews before I pick up the books!) Anyway, this book was no exception. While the premise sounds kind of interesting and mysterious, it really is a warped book.

Although I wasn't thrilled about the topic of teenage witches, it actually was even less interesting than I thought it would be. Just too &quot;teeny-bop&quot; if you know what I mean. A few things were interesting like Gillian's abuse by her father, and how it influenced her, but never really explored. I had to skim through parts just to finish it.	2002-09-11

So it amused me that there was sex in the very first sentence. It also was very interesting to read a \\"romance\\" (it's somewhat unclear if there really is a romance involved) from a male perspective. The story seems to progress in a  rather chopped up manner, no deep feelings are expressed, and it is narated in a rather event-driven way. That is not a negative comment about this book, because I really liked this book. It's just the way I viewed it. Some readers may find the Russian element interesting. I saw it as just a backdrop. When I was done reading it I thought, \\"I'd love to hear Katya's version of the story...\\"	2002-08-13

It is amusing and really gives an interesting peek into the kitchens of any restaurant that you might visit. I'll never again take for granted the ability of a restaurant to make everything come out on time, hot, and wonderfully prepared! Contrary to other reviewers, I didn't mind that this book wandered all over the place. After all, it is not a biography of Alexander the Great! Two things I did object to. My copy had an unacceptable number of misprints in it. Whatever happened to proof-readers? (Like we don't know.) Also, I found the constant inclusion of crude and foul language to be, well, highly forced and almost adolescent. I mean - we get it! Enough already! Overall though, I liked this book.

The characters are poorly developed - often changing personalities rather drastically (like when Della suddenly becomes a &quot;wisecracker&quot;  half way through the book). The premise is ridiculous. Would you turn up on  your (rather distant) friends' doorsteps terminally ill and expect them to  take care of you? The farm itself (which is supposed to be a B&amp;B) is  never fully included in the story - it seems just an uninteresting and  implausable place. I also always resent it when adulterous relationships  are glorified and glamorized. Although nearly everyone had slept with this  guy, Richard, they all obsess endlessly about him. GET REAL! He sounds like  a jerk. I was glad I didn't buy this book (took it out from the library).	2000-03-02

Being the second child, with an older sister I thought this author perfectly captured the essence of that relationship! It was funny in places to the point that I laughed out loud. The book was also  sad and thought provoking. I think especially mothers will understand this  book on a deeper level. Read it - it's great.

(Except dime store romances don't take themselves quite so seriously.)It is a really dumb book - to be blunt. The characters are so unrealistic it is  embarassing and the setting so contrived it is painful. The moral of the  story is this: if you are beautiful, endowed with sexual prowess, money,  and a specimen body, you too could have the world's most perfect romance.  Yuk.	2000-02-29
