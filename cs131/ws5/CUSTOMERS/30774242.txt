Some days, it is hard to comprehend living with such children for yet another day, but Nancy empowers us parents of RADs to persevere & persevere with hope, joy, & love. Her methods have been extraordinarily beneficial to our children, & I think I would have collapsed by now without knowing that someone else out there does indeed understand.  <br /> <br />Nancy's books are vital, as some states (like mine) have ZERO resources for RAD. We needed to be validated. We needed to know we're not alone, & if her books serve no other purpose, they serve those.  <br /> <br />True, like others have said, some of the language is hard to read through. It can be far to \\"flowery\\" at times & sounds like a high school writing student who's been urged repeatedly to use \\"descriptive imagery.\\" Well, in a book about RAD, most readers don't care what the mountains or leaves looked like, but considering the weight of most of the content, the unbearable descriptions can be forgiven (or skipped over).  <br /> <br />Bravo! Bravo! EVERY RAD parent should read this book (as well as Nancy's other books)!	2005-09-12

If you read the section on Satellite Assisted Surveillance (GPS) on pages 161-163 and compare it to the original author's (Willing, R., USA Today), you'll see a scary example of what I mean. Lyman cites Willing, but that hardly justifies using ALL of Willing's data & merely changing a few \\"ands\\" and \\"buts.\\" This book is full of other peoples' work...chopped up & slapped together!

Well, before I received mine, she called me to apologize for how horrible the book was. She told me that she had received hers & was promptly returning it. In advance, she welcomed me to do the same. I received mine last week, & I have to say that I share in her disappointment! Here are the real questions: Do you like vests with doilies stitched on them? Do you like pencils holders made of soup cans with lace glued on them? Ok, if your answers were \\"yes,\\" you'd love this book, but if your answers were \\"no,\\" then don't waste your time or money on this book that shows you how to make lamp shades from used coffee cans & VESTS with fabric panels, lace & such. It really is an embarrassing book. Now, to give credit (& the only reason this book even deserves a \\"1\\"), there are a few cute ideas woven into their disasters of projects, but you have to have an eye to pick those things out. For example, their ivy made of pop cans & craft wire was cute, but you have to see that past the end table made of coffee cans, garden hoses, & swimming pool play toys. Their denim bolster was cute, too, but there is no excuse for filling a bolster with a 2 liter bottle! One could certainly afford a $1.50 bag of stuffing at Wal-Mart! Anyway, there are, like I said, a few notable ideas, but be ready to reinvent them with your own creativity; otherwise, people will smile at your projects through clinched teeth & say, \\"That's nice.\\"\\"	2003-12-12

This was the first book my mother bought me on this subject, & it has become my bible! In fact, I've been trying to find comparable books for some fresh, new ideas, but all of the books I have purchased or been given since have fallen short!<br />Barker starts out with an intro. section that tells you everything you need to know about stripping, painting, molding putty to replace broken details, reinforcing old chairs & drawers, filling handle holes, checking for pests, etc. It shows step by step pictures & has step by step instructions. This section is invaluable, & I refer to it time & time again. <br />Although I would have to agree with the previous viewer about the \\"blues\\" of the chair & the \\"pickled sideboard,\\" Barker does offer many wonderful ideas. I don't personally like all of her ideas, but I think that an important accomplishment this book has made is that she has refinished almost every piece with a different technique; thus, you have the information & knowledge available to you to use your own imagination & mix it up a little. <br />For example, in her bedroom chapter, she shows a Formica topped cabinet that she refinished in a crackle pattern with decoupage fronts. I'm not into the crackle or the decoupage, BUT the actual paint finish was incredible! She stripped, sealed, primed, etc. Then, she used a pale yellow paint. After that, she rubbed the entire surface with an Artist's oil (burnt umber). It was a remarkable, \\"shabby\\" finish!! My hubby & I are now using this basic combination to refinish a bargain, couch table we found..	2003-12-12

Unfortunately, I had never been able to conjure up an appropriate way to describe it. Well, there you go. And yes, \\"recreational\\" means everything it implies.<br /><br />It goes beyond just physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, verbal abuse, or neglect. It is the story of a pattern of (what seems to be) pleasure-driven maltreatment...hence the term \\"recreational.\\" The more common terms don't accurately describe the experiences of children who are forced to eat squirrel eyeballs or toenail clippings...while a sadistic father looks on with raging laughter. The common terms don't give full validation to what it's like to live with a psychopath/sociopath...to live with a person who makes you bathe in a pond or sleep in a hay pile in a barn...just because he thinks it's funny. \\"Recreational\\" is the perfect term to describe the experience of children who know what it's like to be abused \\"just for the fun of it.\\"<br /><br />While I agree with others that the book isn't that elegantly written, it had substance, & while it was sometimes repetitive, I still couldn't put it down.
