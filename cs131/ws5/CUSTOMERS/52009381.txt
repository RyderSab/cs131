The advent of free verse was like literary punk music:  While a potentially liberating influence which could serve to wrest artistic expression from the elite, it also leveled the playing field to such an extent that almost anybody putting words into a \\"poetic\\" arrangement could now call his/her work \\"poetry\\".    I liked Jewel's early music a lot; I'd bought her record Pieces of You a whole year before \\"You Were Meant for Me\\" became a hit, before that song made a little neo-folk album (which had many tracks recorded live, acoustically) into a sales juggernaut.  But even when I was listening to her songs, I never considered Jewel to be much of a lyricist.  Her chief strengths were really melody, a simple guitar style, and her voice.  Jewel's lyrics were almost always direct expressions of what she believes -- no hidden meanings, no craft, and almost never any surprising thoughts (after all, she was 20).    On her poetry, the problem burns right through.  Stripped of the melodies at which she excelled, her writing is awfully sappy, worthy of high-school student scribbles.  And it reads without much verbal (ie. poetic) flow.  Have the layout artist put the verses and stanzas back together, and it sounds like undoctored prose.  What use is the term \\"poetry\\" if it's just prose broken up?  Sometimes Jewel does come up with interesting imagery, but if her artistic expression is all image and no verbal artistry, then she should be doing photography or film work, not poetry.    Young readers with little experience reading poetry may respond to the artlessness of it and embrace the direct sentiments of this writing.  But to them I would suggest:  Write your own poetry, get your friends to do the same, and read one another's works.  Chances are it'll be just as good as what's collected and published here.  Even Jewel herself admitted that the publication of these poems was due to her fame as a musician, not her skill as a poet, and frankly, I don't think her writing comes close to being able to stand alone without her guitar and songwriting.	2005-01-29

Let me first clarify the confusion over Sun Wu (\\"Sun Tzu\\")'s The Art of War and this book.<br /><br />This is not a translation of the book The Art of War as it is known by the Western world.  Sun Wu, a strategist from hundreds of years before Zhuge Liang, is indeed the father of Chinese military strategy, but culturally Zhuge Liang has acquired an even higher stature.  A master strategist in the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Liang was dubbed \\"The Hidden Dragon\\", one of the two greatest strategists of the time, alongside his colleague Pang Tong (\\"The Young Phoenix\\").  Zhuge Liang almost single-handedly turned the wandering  warlord Liu Bei, \\"whose army did not exceed a thousand\\", into one of the three superpowers during the Chinese civil wars of the Three Kingdoms.  Zhuge Liang's reputation for manipulating the enemy was so great that he eventually became known as a sorceror figure who was able to summon weather and conjure spirits to do his bidding.  For the record -- Zhuge Liang, philosophically, belonged to the \\"ru jia\\", or \\"confucianism\\", and *not* taoism or legalism, though often his methodology and concepts show similarities to the latter two.  Zhuge Liang belongs in a tradition of \\"ru zhang\\", or \\"confucian generals\\", military leaders who were learned and studied, skilled in literature and philosophy, yet actively led military campaigns.<br /><br />His influence has permeated Chinese culture -- in Chinese language, the name \\"Zhuge Liang\\" is now used (and not archaically) as a symbol of preternatural intelligence, while if you used \\"Sun Tzu\\" in your everyday language, you'd be considered pretentious.<br /><br />Finally, the very title \\"The Art of War\\" has always been misleading.  The Chinese term \\"bing fa\\" means more along the lines of \\"the methodology of war\\", and the use of this term often does *not* refer to the specific title of Sun Wu's treatise; the words \\"bing fa\\" are often used in the way you'd use the words \\"geography\\", \\"physics\\", or \\"agriculture\\".  The translation \\"The Art of War\\" probably puts Sun Wu's original work more in the realm of philosophy than was ever intended -- imagine if a book entitled \\"Geographical Studies\\" were translated as \\"The Art of the Earth\\".<br /><br />This particular book is *not* a translation of Sun Wu's \\"bing fa\\".  It does not pretend to be one:  The cover explicitly says that it is \\"Zhuge Liang's and Liu Ji's commentaries on the classic by Sun Tzu\\".  So those who complain that this is a poor translation of Sun Wu's book need to have their eyesight checked.<br /><br />That said, I still have major issues with this book.<br /><br />I've never had the chance to read any of Zhuge Liang's original writings on warfare.  Fictitious accounts of his life as related in Romance of the Three Kingdoms mention books that he'd passed onto his military successor Jiang Wei, but I had never found these in the original Chinese language.  Thomas Cleary's translated passages in this book read as extremely dry, and far too general.  Most of the concepts amount to \\"Be kind to your men, be smart in dealing with your enemies, don't fight unless victory is sure\\".  All true, of course, but how useful is that?  Occasionally interesting angles emerge (\\"to know an officer, get them drunk to observe their nature\\"; \\"a decadence in a general - to assess others without assessing oneself\\"), but all in all, these translated passages read like proverbs, with broadly defined terms.  Not having read the original Chinese text, I don't know whether the problem stems from the original works by Zhuge Liang or from Mr. Cleary's translations, but I do know that the Chinese language, especially passages of discourse, are highly difficult to translate and often come across as broad and imprecise when put into another language.  There are so many Chinese words without properly English equivalents (for example \\"Xiao\\", which combines filial obedience with love, and \\"Yi\\", which means far more than just \\"honour\\" or \\"loyalty\\" could convey) that Chinese-English translation is always a tricky business.<br /><br />However, in moving to the second half, the \\"Liu Ji\\" section, I find major flaws in Mr. Cleary's work.  The right-hand man of Ming Dynasty founder Zhu Yuan Zhang, Liu Ji was another strategist who had acquired near-mystical status; under his familiar name \\"Liu Ba Wen\\", Liu Ji is known as a fortune-teller figure who saves Zhu by reading omens and stars.  He's not exactly known for military strategy in the same way as Sun Wu or Zhuge Liang, but once I'd figured out who he was, I was quite eager to read the translation.<br /><br />Much like the approach of Meng Zi (\\"Mencius\\"), Liu Ji uses examples and stories to illustrate his points -- which makes his points a livelier read.  Unfortunately, here Mr. Cleary's translations are often awkward, bogged down by names and geography.  This book was smart in including a timeline of dynasties and Chinese historical periods referred to in Liu Ji's tales, but probably should have included maps from various periods.  Many of the warlord states and territories over Chinese history share the same phonetic translation (\\"Jin\\", \\"Han\\", \\"Wei\\", and \\"Wu\\" all have multiple, disparate representatives throughout Chinese history), and Mr. Cleary's translations of these tales become very cluttered because of this.  I had studied the Warring States and Three Kingdoms periods quite a bit, if not in an academic setting, and even I was usually confused as to when and where I was in a particular tale.<br /><br />However, Mr. Cleary makes an even greater mistake in certain tales by omitting the names of participants.  And when a tale refers to \\"this general and that governor and that other general...\\", it's linguistic chaos.  As difficult as it may be to know the various phonetically translated names, omitting them not only raises questions as to the translation's faithfulness to the original text, but also discredits such tales on a stylistic level -- without the specificity of characters, the accounts may well have been fictitious (though they're not).<br /><br />On a very broad level, some of the concepts in this book probably can be applied to the modern day.  But there are precious few strategies to be absorbed from here that are detailed and specific enough to prove practically useful.  Personally, I had bought this book in hopes of getting a more historical and less mystical picture of the man Zhuge Liang himself, and on that front, this book was entirely wrong for the job.  I knew no more about Zhuge Liang after reading this than I had known from growing up in Chinese culture, reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and my past historical research into the Three Kingdoms period.

Not only is it the earliest of the \\"Four Great Books\\" (as evidenced by its more archaic language), but it created a complete cultural phenomenon whose impact is still fresh today -- just ask all the young people today who, without having read a word of the book, still know the characters from the strategy and fighting video games released by the company Koei.  And how many literary works can claim to have had a direct impact on history as this book, which was used as a strategy text by the great Manchurian leader Nurhachi and his son Hongtaiji?<br /><br />I'd read the original archaic text when I was about eight years old, so obviously my views will be heavily slanted by my familiarity with this text.  On approaching this translation, what I find is a well done, respectful and informative translation that doesn't quite nail the tone of the original text, but will be a good read for modern readers who don't read Chinese.<br /><br />And to be honest, Chinese is extremely hard to translate into English.  Just the fact that subjects, articles and pronouns are often omitted from a sentence is enough to cause nightmares for a Chinese-English translator.  And even by Chinese standards, The Three Kingdoms is a work whose linguistic economy is staggering.  In one page, this book can convey the deaths of half a dozen characters, three to four battles, multiple schemes, and include four or five \\"tribute\\" poems, to boot.  Such is the style of this work, and it could not have been easy for translator Moss Roberts to adapt this style into English.  And he has done the job remarkably, for though I don't think he was able to convey the flavour and rhythm of the original language (the question is, also, whether that would have been possible), his translation makes a good read, and strives to be faithful to the original text, down to the chapter divisions and the inclusion of the \\"tribute\\" poems which frequent the book.  This was an essential piece in the style of the book and I was joyed to see the device retained.<br /><br />There are instances scattered throughout where I felt the tone of the language may have been misinterpreted, or diluted by the language barrier.  Obviously, I'm not a Chinese professor (as Prof. Roberts is), but as a native speaker, I felt his translations sometimes didn't quite hit the mark.  For example, in the original text, one poem on the character Cao Cao distinctly used a word which meant \\"deception\\" or \\"guile\\", but Prof. Roberts adapted it to \\"craft\\", which dilutes the disapproving tone of the original.  When Yuan Shao refused aid to Liu Bei on account of his son's illness, his advice to the messenger was \\"if he is in trouble, he may seek refuge with me\\", which suggests patronage, not \\"find refuge north of the river\\", which suggests a tactical manoeuvre related to geography.  These are but two examples and you can certainly argue that the meaning of the original text is up for grabs, but as a Chinese native speaker and reader, one who has grown up with this text and re-read the book hundreds of times, I still find the translation a little off.  There is also no attempt at creating period flavour in the language -- the translation is modern, not aiming to add archaic English flavour to try to reflect the age of the original Chinese text.  This may be a good point, however, since the use of archaic English added to the language barrier might have resulted in a book that's very difficult to read.  I think Prof. Roberts sacrificed flavour for clarity, a fair tradeoff to the benefit of the translation.<br /><br />Again, the question is whether an English translation (or any other translation) could ever be accurate in this way to the original.  Personally, I do think many of the discrepancies in meaning could have been avoided, or ameliorated.  However, as aforementioned, for a reader who's never read the original, this issue won't affect his/her enjoyment of the text.  Just the fact that there is a translation of this extremely important work of Chinese literature is a cause for celebration, and for those people new to this realm, this set of books is a great discovery.his/her enjoyment of the text.

I had already finished X-Men Legends before I got this guide; after all, it's a pretty short game.  But I can definitely say it's more fun with the guide in hand.    By and large this guide is free of the bad writing and false information that had plagued so many BradyGames guides I've used before.  There's a large number of charts, lists, analytical databases and other devices which make the unlockables in the game much easier to find.  And while the maps aren't exactly easy to read, the layout of the levels in X-Men Legends is so cluttered that I think the authors and layout artists did a good job of translating the maps into useful, legible form.  The combat strategies they suggest almost always work, and they summarize each level succinctly so that you know what you're about to get into.    Why only four stars?  The layout of the book can sometimes be awkward -- too much eye candy sacrificing legibility and flow.  For example, it's often not clear on a page whether you're supposed to read the upper-right map first or the lower-left one.  The written passages are often up to half a page behind the maps and sidebars, making for confusing navigation.  And they did have omissions on the maps, leaving out one or two items, but not enough to spoil everything.    All in all, a very good guide with minor flaws.	2004-10-19

An open letter to writers Mark Androvich and Greg Off:  This is without a doubt one of the worst strategy guides I've ever used.<br />The consensus is that Syphon Filter:  The Omega Strain is an incredibly difficult game, so a strategy guide is essential for those of us who don't fancy spending four hours trying to solve one part of a video game.<br />To give this book a little credit, I was able to follow 50 per cent of the general directions on when to go where in the game.  But the layout and writing are so horrible that I ended up sitting there, with the game on pause, desperately trying to interpret what the writers truly meant when they wrote a certain passage.  I'm not talking grammar or syntax here; I'm talking about &quot;right&quot; when it should have been &quot;left&quot;!  After about two levels in the game I realized that the writers' sense of direction is plain wrong and began exploring the game on my own, using the book only as a loose tour book, and that helped.  They also adore giving you the second-worst solution to many of the activities:  Their recommendation to use the K-bar knife on Thae-bok Jon in the Yemen Arms Bazaar cost me 10 replays of the game until I realized you could simply shoot him with a silenced rifle.  Aren't strategy guides supposed to spare you the pain by giving you the easiest, quickest solution?  If I'd listened to my own instincts, I would have finished the level long ago.<br />I'm still using this guide to help get past this overly difficult, design-flawed game.  Without any kind of signpost, this game is just too nonlinear and confusing to warrant a try.  However, having to &quot;interpret&quot; the writing, and wade through the bad advice, is something a reader of a strategy guide shouldn't ever have to do.  A very bad job, Mr. Androvich and Mr. Off.	2004-05-23

Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness is pretty sensationalistic. Then again, so is the star who's the focal point of this book. J. Randy Taraborelli's notorious biography of Michael Jackson is very well written, with plenty of sources and documentation to support its assertions as well as an authorative tone of investigative journalism which really leads me to believe that what it describes is true.<br />Some of the book's most interesting points are about Michael and the Jackson siblings' relationship to Joe and Katharine Jackson. Taraborelli's thesis about the domination of Katharine Jackson over the Jackson children is fascinating stuff, as is his probe into the relationship between the two superstars, Michael and Janet. His analysis of Michael Jackson's music is also detailed and convincing, and he has many small anecdotal touches which add immensely to the flavour and make this book a very fast read indeed. Examples include a fan of the Jackson 5 who was allegedly seduced by Jackie Jackson; a secretary who claimed she was beaten up by Katharine and Janet Jackson; and a Soul Train dancer who may have taught Jackson his signature \\"Moonwalk\\" move but says that Jackson's version is not really a \\"Moonwalk\\".<br />I only have one criticism of this book, which is directed at the final few paragraphs of this book where Taraborelli steps out of objective mode and tries to state his thesis about how Michael Jackson became who he is. I felt that he had made his points well and clear before this without having to moralize about it. Nevertheless, it's a small flaw in what is otherwise a highly engaging biographical work. I've been hoping that Taraborelli would add some new chapters which would cover the turbulent decade in Jackson's career since this book's publication -- the Dangerous album, HIStory, \\"Scream\\", Blood on the Dance Floor, the marriage to Lisa Marie Presley...given his authority and smart writing, Taraborelli's observations and research into this materialwould be essential reading. But it's never too late, and one can always hope...	2003-04-29

I was a fledgling metalhead back in 1989 and as a result enjoyed reading this book of record reviews.  Martin Popoff's metal collection (or recollection of his collection) is quite vast, and he does tend to have strong opinions about each and every one of these records, which always helps when it comes to a reviewer.  However, I have problems with his writing.  In appealing to the kind of frat-boy language mostly associated with the stereotypical metal fan (Wayne and Garth, if you will), Popoff comes off as extremely condescending towards his readers.  Among his transgressions:  a)  His sexist disdain for &quot;chick metal&quot; in general -- attack Lee Aaron and Lita Ford to your heart's content, but politicizing the issue is disappointing; b) Pretending not to know &quot;what a producer does&quot;.  I mean, come on!  c)  His soundtrack reviews, which are so scanty that they're passable at best, juvenile at worst; d) His habit of seguing into completely irrelevant rants, such as his reference to the Three Tenors and Barenaked Ladies; e) He lets his personal life get in the way.  His mentions of his onetime hometown Nelson, B.C. are always off-topic.<br />A good book for an overview of heavy metal.  Popoff doesn't lack for knowledge or opinion on the matter, but it's discouraging to see that even a metal fan writing a book on heavy metal would not set the preconceived notions aside and actually write journalistically lucid accounts of the music.  Thus, this book qualifies as entertaining novelty but not music scholarship.	2002-07-10

Terrible writing and layout, missing information, scanty  descriptions...all this made this strategy guide more frustrating than  useful to me.  It'd been years since I played an RPG and Final Fantasy  Anthology has been pretty frustrating (though involving) to me, so I  expected this guide to help me through.  As it turns out, most of the time  I have an easier time feeling my own way out than trying to use this  guide.<br />I've only been playing Final Fantasy V so far so my judgments are  based on the book's guide to that game.<br />Firstly, no world maps.  The one  found in the game is junk because of its small size, and the way author  David Cassady guides you from point to point is so vague that you're better  off just exploring on your own.  The flashy layout of the book means that  it's very hard to navigate through information.  The lists (bestiaries,  items etc.) are organized very poorly, and hard to read.  The step-by-step  walkthrough of the game is so scanty it's laughable -- often Cassady will  just give you one screenshot of the entrance to a certain secret path and  say, &quot;Walk on and you'll eventually find the boss&quot;.  Big help,  indeed!  And there are times when Cassady seems to deliberately mislead you  -- the example that comes to mind right now is the battle with Shiva in  Walz -- at Level 7, you couldn've have learned Fire2 yet, and Cassady  oh-so-conveniently forgets to disclose that fact.  It's possible to defeat  Shiva without Fire2, but as the author of a game guide, Cassady should have  told us.  And it's always in leaving out the details that Cassady managed  to confuse rather than clarify the game for me, by things like skipping  over a step in describing the plot, neglecting certain aspects of the boss  characters, and vague, uninvolving writing laid out poorly, flying here and  there across the page until my eyes become all crossed.<br />The only use I  found for this guide has been in locating hidden items in the game.  Is  that worth the purchase price?  You be the judge.	2000-08-08

I read this in its original 12-installment crossover form in the mid-'90s so some of my facts could be off.<br /><br />This crossover was basically an excuse to cram as many characters as possible into one storyline and that results  in a lot of confusions.  Also, it detracts from the believability of the  Stryfe character and also makes his motivations somewhat unclear.  He's out  for vengeance against Apocalypse (who had injected him with the virus as a  child), Cable (whom he sees as his inferior clone), and his parents Cyclops  and Jean Grey (for abandoning him).  But what's his ultimate vengeance?  And the X-teams' method of finally locating him is pretty ludicrous, the  story getting a little too busy with sending its heroes here and there that  for two or three issues worth, the X-teams just seem to be wandering here  and there fighting everybody.  The most focused storylines are that of  Wolverine and Bishop, who encounter Cable, the falsely accused assassin,  and Beast, desperately trying to save Xavier and finally succeeds only  because of Apocalypse's help.<br /><br />It's still fun, of course, to watch Bishop  and Wolverine duke it out with Cable, and X-Factor rounding up X-Force with  the help of the X-Men.  But these are weakened by some really weak scenes  like Apocalypse's fight with Stryfe (no power, no excitement, with huge  lapses in logic) and some embarrassing dialogue at points (Jean Grey's  lovey-dovey conversations with Cyclops during their attempted escape from  the moonbase are just awful writing).<br /><br />The most valuable thing to me about  the X-ecutioner's Song series is a comparison of the different visual  styles of the three series.  X-Factor is stark and more than a little whacked (its stories as I remember are also much more off-kilter thanks to  smart-mouthed characters like Polaris, Wolfsbane/Rahne, Quicksilver and  Agent Val); X-Force is more violent and rebelliious; and X-Men, the parent  series, is more restrained and middle-of-the-road, less eccentric.<br /><br />Worthy  examination of the relationship among the X-series.  Writing issues are  compensated for by the big showdowns and action sequences, capped off by  Cable's final, violent confrontation with Stryfe.	2000-07-18

It's too bad that over the course of X-Men history, Jean Grey has died and been resurrected so many times that she's become something of a comic-industry in-joke.  It's to the detriment of one's perception of the  depth of the original story.  She remains possibly the most complex of  X-Men characters, and her dark history is chronicled in this well-written  collection that tells what is considered the best storyline in X-Men's  history.<br />My one gripe is with the artwork.  Yes, it's dated, but there's  a much more important issue here -- why is it that they used only one page  to illustrated the climactic sacrifice?  In this one scene is incorporated  the fate of the whole team of X-Men (whether they will be killed by the  Imperial Guard), the ultimate fate of the love between Phoenix and Cyclops,  Phoenix' final decision (her humanity, or her power?), and the fate of the  universe.  Even the defeat of Colossus at the hands of Gladiator received  more panels.  The scant amount of space devoted to this devastating ending  is a matter of storytelling, and the age of the comic doesn't excuse it  from a fault on this level.<br />Other than that, it's one of the most  effective orchestrations of the huge cast in the X-Men series.  Most of the  time, storylines in comic books like this revolve around the appearance of  some anticipated character or another.  Here it's driven by emotion and  story development, and the Dark Phoenix/Phoenix character remains  fascinating, driven less by malevolence than hunger and arrogance.  One  occasion where a lowbrow cultural form like the comic book has produced  something worthy of deeper consideration beyond that of simple  entertainment.	2000-07-18

Though it'd be easy to lump Natacha Merritt with the rest of the webcam/internet exhibitionists, it took only one examination of this book to make me see otherwise in Merritt's digital photography.<br />With a  maverick's audacity and technical disregard (one interviewer made the  humorous remark that Merritt &quot;can't tell an f-stop from a bus  stop&quot;), Merritt has somehow managed to discover a visual style all her  own that fuses strange angles, simple lighting, unusual placement of her  subjects, and introspection into one.  The more explicit photos oftimes  threaten to de-humanize Merritt herself and her subjects, but those are  counterbalanced by some very tasteful, evocative shots that convey the  subjects' internal drama.<br />Merritt makes a better subject than any other  person in this book for her own camera.  It doesn't hurt that she's  gorgeous, but she has two things to her advantage:  Expressive eyes, and  the unique dynamic of photographer-as-subject.  Is she simultaneously  empowered and scrutinized by the camera?  How often does she know what  exactly the image looks like?  And which photos are staged?  Which ones are  taken as a fly-on-the-wall snapshot?  Merritt is always interesting as her  own subject, and it is telling that the best set of pictures in this book,  the &quot;self search&quot; series, focus much less on sexual acts than on  self-discovery, examination, and Merritt's relationship to the camera and  to her own body.  Most of these are close-ups from wildly imaginative  angles, shadowy, and intriguing -- the crowning picture is Merritt looking  at her own hand in a mirror, contemplating.  These pictures tell many  stories about the young woman both in front of and behind the camera, and  they're beautiful and revealing in a way far beyond the sexually explicit  pictures.  Most of those do manage to achieve a degree of honesty and  spontaneity as well, making them erotically charged.<br />Accusations of  narcissism can't be avoided and Merritt can probably be said to be guilty  of it sometimes.  But what she produces from her unique work methods is so  intriguing, and her revelation of herself as photographer (a rarity in  photography) so far-reaching, that this book remains a great fascination.   It'd be a shame if it were to be lumped with the usual erotic photography  and exhibitionistic endeavours.  Digital Diaries has much more to offer.	2000-05-26

Having finished Syphon Filter 2 on my own (and not without difficulty) and gotten the book after the fact, I find the secrets revealed in this book wonderful, but some of the strategies questionable.  For example: - At the  rate the book recommends, you won't have enough crossbow bolts in the Aljir  Prison Break-in level;  - Use the .45 in the Gregorov level?  It's slow,  noisy, and not very accurate -- hardly the best for taking out the lights;  - Chance is much more easily defeated than that long-winded strategy they  describe -- simply manoeuvre by the chopper and you'll be fine; - The M-16  works much better against Morgan.  Also, when you're stalling him, there's  no reason you have to leave the first crate's cover at all. - There *must*  have been another way other than the button sequence to open up the  &quot;Disc 1/2 Movies&quot; secret -- I didn't have the sequence, but I had  those movies opened up, and I don't even know how.<br />That said, the last  page of the book alone is worth the price.  Since the developers of Syphon  Filter 2 have put in a generous number of secrets but made the requirements  for the secrets very obscure (aside from &quot;Girlie Magazine&quot; and  &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;, obviously!), that list was invaluable and  allowed me to open up many more Multiplayer Arenas, even though I'll  probably never use them.  And the walkthroughs, if I had needed them, are  quite detailed, with lots of screenshots so that you can compare where you  are and find the right place by matching game to photo.<br />If only they'd  also offered some cheats (invincibility or infinite ammo would be nice --  the thought of the &quot;Hard Mode&quot; of *this* ultrahard game shivers  my skin).  Still, well worth getting if you like Syphon Filter 2.	2000-04-04

I remember being stuck on several levels in Syphon Filter -- the underground Silo Access Tunnels, for example, took me several weeks to crack -- but despite being frustrated time and time again, I found myself coming back to this game.  At some point I even gave up ever trying to  finish it, goofing off, replaying levels...until, suddenly, I realized that  the practice allowed me to get past the Silo Access Tunnel level that got  me every time.<br />Just for this addictive quality alone Syphon Filter wins  me over.  Plus there's a seamless blend of movie-style footage and  player-controlled gaming (enhanced by the designers' decision to retain the  graphics of the game in FMV sequences, a choice that was attacked by one  magazine reviewing Syphon Filter 2).  Personally, I applaud the successful  effort to blur action and story, making them as one; I'd rather get sucked  into the story than see some pretty graphics unfold.<br />Some grudges:  Just  like its sequel, Syphon Filter very often challenges the player's  familiarity with the levels, not response or understanding.  Because of  heavy reliance on &quot;stealth missions&quot; (even more so in Syphon  Filter 2), it's easy to get a mission botched instantaneously, especially  in the &quot;Rhoemer's Base&quot; level.  I don't mind setting up stealth  as a mission objective, but unless I've played through that level, how am I  supposed to know there are three guards in three directions at this certain  point?  Just like Syphon 2, Syphon Filter often forces you to play a level  multiple times, which can often be annoying (spoiling the sense that the  mission is in real time).  This reliance on foreknowledge as a player asset  gets tiresome after a while.<br />Small gripes on a title that I kept playing  over and over, even months after I cracked it.	2000-04-02

Though Nicholas Pileggi's source book, Wise Guy, gave this screenplay both its voice-over and its final conclusion, the screenplay to GoodFellas is an essential addition to any screenplay library.  If not for the fact that  Pileggi and Martin Scorsese have pulled off the mammoth task of  interpreting the detailed-packed, wide-scoped vision of the book into  cinema-speak, then for the writing itself.  GoodFellas is a screenplay that  can be read as entertainment -- fast-paced, crisp, clear, and exciting.   The published version of this script is mostly in master-scene form, giving  only the most evocative details, beautifully paced.  This is one of the  crowning entries in Faber and Faber's superb screenplay series, ranking  right up there along Paul Schrader's Taxi Driver and Odets/Lehmann's for  Sweet Smell of Success.  To any upstart screenwriter or serious student of  film, this series is invaluable.	2000-03-19

English has unsuccessfully juxtaposed the third-person journalistic mode with stretches of third-person narrative (like a novel).<br />As with most gangster tales, The Westies realizes that the reader needs an  &quot;in&quot; -- a character to identify with, somebody through which we  can experience the world.  Unfortunately, in the case of The Westies the  mix of the personal and historical is very shaky.  The first 50 pages of  The Westies is a clumsy read, with disorienting shifts in time, unnecessary  flashback, too many conflicting points of view, and too much detail.  I can  understand why, in the case of Mickey Featherstone's &quot;insanity&quot;  trial, why English might adopt his defense attourney's point of view, but  what's the point of adopting &quot;the victim&quot; Canelstein's point of  view for the beginning of the first chapter?  This may have been English's  idea of a suspense sequence, but it's just one of the many times when, lost  in his own flashy narrative techniques, English sacrifices flow,  cause-and-effect, and exposition.  The result is an uneasy hybrid of novel,  memoir and reporting, where plot points appear arbitrary and indeed  paratactic.  He also doesn't have enough restraint as a writer, often  lapsing into the voice of his characters, but not doing it enough to  establish a recognizable pattern (eg. &quot;In keeping with Evzerhoff's  advice, Hochheiser didn't ask him nothin' about psychiatry.&quot;).  If  English had wanted to establish his third-person narrator as a participant  with a stake in these events, he should have done so all the way.  Instead,  flourishes like this not only jar with the telling of the story, but only  point to a writer who uses too much cream and not enough flour.  When your  narrator doesn't even pay enough attention to things like duplicate names  -- annoyingly, there are at least half a dozen instances where English  simply says, &quot;Mickey did this, Mickey did that&quot;, despite the  presence of about four or five characters named Mickey in the book -- it's  a shaky proposition indeed.  And when he launches into yet another of his  melodramatic &quot;novel moments&quot; -- such as the confrontation between  Featherstone and Beattie over the betrayal of Paddy Dugan -- it rings  incredibly false because it hasn't been set up properly. <br />The story isn't  bad, and the historical background which forms its basis is certainly  intriguing, but The Westies does its subjects little justice.  By either  lack of skill or carelessness, English has sold short what appears to be a  solid, credible piece of research.	2000-03-19
US	52009381	R2PMSISJLYXF9Y	0671723227	892474008	Wiseguy	Books	5	86	90	N	Y	Brutal, absorbing, hilarious.	The outsider's nonchalance of chief narrator Henry Hill and Nicholas Pileggi's highly restrained hand in helping him relate his story has resulted in a book which shuns any sense of melodrama and emotional  attachment.  Instead, we get a highly intelligent, insightful, and funny  look at Mafia life, stuffed with fascinating details.<br />As befits his  reporter background, Pileggi stays at a distance.  Unlike its offspring  movie GoodFellas, where director Martin Scorsese effortlessly blended the  smart-aleck text of the book (incorporating it into the film as probably  the best voice-over ever written and performed) with elements of suspense,  poetry, sensuality, visual comedy, and energy.  In Pileggi's book, it's all  cerebral.  Hill's magnetic personality and storytelling talents make this  book an addictive read.  Pileggi also flaunts a real editorial talent,  skipping out of Hill's first-person account and delving into journalistic  mode at the most suitable moments, giving background where necessary, and  stepping back to let the reader make the moral judgments as s/he sees  fit.<br />Different from, but the equal of, GoodFellas.  I'd take the opposite  stance from other people by saying that it's probably better to see the  film first; the emotional investment Scorsese weaves into the story offers  a rich contrast to the book's neutral tone.  And reversing the process will  also facilitate the viewer/reader in seeing through the outdated accusation  of &quot;This didn't really happen&quot; when watching the film.	2000-03-17

Connie Fletcher picked the right approach in tackling this subject; like Nicholas Pileggi's Wise Guy:  Life in a Mafia Family, What Cops Know is told almost entirely in the subjects' own words, giving it an immediacy and  buoyancy that can be mesmerizing.  As one police officer stated, they have  to develop a sense of humour about what they do.  So their toughness, their  panache for strange parlance and anecdotes, and their occasional bursts of  machismo are delivered first-generation, Fletcher having the good sense to  hold back on her editorial comments (something a writer like Colin Wilson  overindulges in, making his books extremely moralistic) and just let her  subjects tell their stories.<br />The book started off slowly (the foreword  explaining the approach, though useful, was cut-and-dry stuff, though  certainly useful), but after getting through the first section, I plowed  through 200 pages in one sitting.  Some of the stories are plain hilarious;  some disturbing and sombre; some made me downright sick to my stomach.  The  child-molestation section was harrowing; I'm usually very objective in my  approach to reading, but the story of the mother &quot;selling&quot; her  six-year-old child to strangers gut-punched me.<br />Reading through this  book, you begin to understand that the police have one of the most  strenuous, underappreciated, and potentially corrupting jobs in Western  society.	2000-03-17
US	52009381	R2V40KCA0SG1AM	0451167716	638098276	The Godfather (Signet)	Books	5	26	33	N	Y	Trashy, but absorbing nonetheless.	The canonization of Francis Ford Coppola's two-part adaptation of this book in the film world has made us forget that, upon its release, The Godfather (the novel) was actually considered quite pulpy, and not of the  high-art status that the films have achieved.<br />Personally, I couldn't care  less -- Mario Puzo is an entertaining storyteller, and the characters he  created were marvellous -- the seemingly docile Michael Corleone; hothead  Santino; Tom Hagen, the brilliant lawyer with an identity crisis; Luca  Brasi (underused in the film version), the subhuman brute; Albert Neri, a  man driven by circumstances into the world of crime; and of course Vito  Corleone himself, the elegant mastermind, a man with a dream, a  romanticization of the crimelord as a patriarch of King Lear  proportions.<br />The novel benefits from its chosen form.  A scarcely  acknowledged fact about the Godfather pictures is that much-needed  exposition often had to get excised because there was so much back story to  each character set up in the book that the film form couldn't handle  adequately.  You might notice in the Godfather films how Michael's return  to America is completely unexplained; Luca Brasi's power and strength are  never shown onscreen (he appears at the wedding, then dies in the bar at  the hands of the Tattaglias); Paulie Gatto becomes a skimpish character;  Genco Abbandando disappears; and Tom Hagen's conflicts about being  consigliere are minimized.  Even given two three-hour films, the amount of  information in the one source novel couldn't be disclosed properly,  resulting in huge gaps of information.  Puzo's novel does it well, with  exaggeratedly elevated language, character behaviour, and third-person  narrative.  It works beautifully, even given its trashier inclinations (eg.  commentaries on Lucy Mancini's anatomy, and the large Johnny Fontaine/Nino  Valenti subplot).<br />Small wonder that this larger-than-life novel spawned  the most famous film series of alltime, the first entry of which has been  called the best film ever made (I have contentions with that).  The  Godfather can be read as pure entertainment and, if so desired, as  literature.	2000-03-08

American Beauty was a well-rounded work all the way through -- from the acting to the cinematography, from the production design to the score.  No surprise, then, that the screenplay holds up just as well as any other  component of the film, even as the film consciously (and laudably) went  beyond the script's confines and explored much more on an emotional and  aesthetic level.<br />The screenplay (unfortunately, a &quot;shooting  script&quot;, not an accurate representation of earlier drafts) leans  towards comedy a little more without sacrificing the emotional potential of  the scenes.  The setups and payoffs are brilliant (the Ricky  Fitts-Colonel-Lester Burnham dynamic is mind-boggling, and Angela's  character arc is highly moving), the dialogue crisp and convincing, and the  balance between conventional sitcom techniques and wildly novel scene  construction a skillful one.<br />This published screenplay isn't as useful as  a study guide to screenwriting -- the construct of American Beauty is too  complex, its multiple-character approach too delicate for just any upstart  screenwriter (like yours truly) to emulate.  It remains extremely readable,  a beautiful experience, and an entity that can exist comfortably both in  the context of the film itself (the best film of the last 10 years, I would  argue) and outside of it, simply as literature.	2000-02-17

Some of the information is good (like the section on the first Armored Core which details how to find those hidden AC parts, if a bit sketchy), some questionable (use missiles against somebody in the arena and you end  up dead), and some of it is dead out wrong (in the arena oppoonents section  the writer frequently misnames the weapon, getting confused when it comes  to the difference between a Gatling gun, the quadruple-rifle machine gun,  and the chain gun).<br />I'd finished Project Phantasma before I got my hands  on the book, so Keith Kolmos' points on that game weren't so much useful as  novel to me.  He didn't seem to nail the best ways to complete certain  missions.  For example, if you use the 3000-shot &quot;Finger&quot; machine  gun on Phantasma, or one of the dual cannons on the arm, or even the 50- or  70-shot rockets with a heavily armored machine, you wouldn't need any luck  at all.  Why he doesn't make mention of two of the most powerful weapons  (&quot;Finger&quot; machine gun and LS-99 Moonlight, which you get in the  &quot;Kill Struggle Leader&quot; mission in the first Armored Core) of the  game is baffling.<br />I enjoy this book, but didn't use it much except when  it came to the first Armored Core and finding the hidden AC parts of which  I'd only found two until reading the book.  Interesting, but not essential.	2000-02-05

Richard Kern's photographic and film works are immediately identifiable -- blending S&amp;M, punk-rock, documentary and fetish styles into a sensibility that is at once bold and revolting, sensual and ugly.<br />His  photographs are more intriguing than his films, which suffer from too much  emphasis on violence, oftimes bad acting, and shaky shot selection (and I'm  not referring just to the handheld style).  It's surprising how beautiful  some of Kern's photographic subjects appear very often, just because his  style has a complete lack of pretension that can be inviting.<br />Granted,  all the violent imagery, gun fetishes, and people (usually women) in  compromising positions gets repetitive.  But Kern is one artist you can  pick out from the crowd on the spot, and his toughness can be welcome in a  world of airbrushes and perfect bodies and makeup.  You could even argue  some of these subjects look more human in this style than in any fashion  magazine!	2000-01-20

I confess I wouldn't have been able to finish the game without the guide.  Now that I've played through all the missions several times, however, I have some gripes with the guide.<br />Some parts of this guide are incredibly  vague -- namely the first parts and the section relating to the  &quot;Rhoemer's Base&quot; mission.  Omissions on the first missions are  forgivable because they're easy enough for anybody with video-game  experience to hack through, but the guide's tips on how to crack Rhoemer's  Base are a disaster -- vague directions, always resorting to &quot;look at  the level map&quot; (the &quot;level map&quot; in question, accessible  through the game's menu, is so poorly drawn that you're more often than not  better off just looking at the screen and figuring out where to go from  there).<br />Other little disagreements:  Never just use the Biz-2 (use the  weapon your opponent's using, almost always); the shotgun, not the M-16,  against Anton Girdeux; the grenade is the best weapon against Triggerman  Marcos; don't try to evade the guards when you're on the dinosaur's back --  go back down to eliminate them or they'll shoot you while you dangle in the  air; the .45 is the best weapon when covering for the CBDC agents in the  park; the taser is the most useful weapon against single  non-flak-jacket-wearing enemies; use an automatic weapon, not the  nightvision rifle, in &quot;Tunnel Blackout&quot;; and so on.<br />All in all,  very useful -- for Syphon Filter was designed in such a complicated way  (the maps are insanely complex, especially the &quot;Pharcom  Warehouses&quot; level) that the guide can save a first-timer hours of  figuring out just where to walk.  Still, improvements could be made.	2000-01-05

Be suspicious of any biography that cites fewer than 20 resources!<br />The quickie layout and flaky fonts used in the printing should clue you in:  This was not a carefully, painstakingly researched work.  Laughably, it  didn't even catch on to the biggest wave of Woo awareness, which was  probably in the mid-'90s when Quentin Tarantino was also at his peak and  Woo was coming out with Broken Arrow.<br />Context aside, the contents of this  book bear up poorly to close scrutiny.  Heard dedicated less than half the  book to Woo's 20-year career and personal life prior to 1986's A Better  Tomorrow.  Granted, that film was Woo's defining work and his commercial  breakthrough, but his struggles in the productive but repressive Hong Kong  film industry would have been valuable insight into his character and his  working habits.  Instead, Heard goes into reviewer mode and goes film by  film (in the case of Woo's pre-1986 works, he skips certain ones) and  basically says whether each is good or bad, successful or not.  But we get  no details on production, whom Woo worked with (who was Director of  Photography?  Screenwriter?  Producer?), scheduling, any problems with the  productions, and -- most grievously -- we don't get any idea on how these  early productions affected Woo as a filmmaker.<br />Seemingly at a loss when  looking for validation for this elusive, highly distinctive filmmaker whose  history few in the U.S. public know, Heard is relegated to making a Quentin  Tarantino reference when trying to prove that Woo's work is valuable.  Even  when undergoing the obvious task of citing Woo trademarks that have seeped  into U.S. films, Heard neglects such extremely Woo-derivative films such as  Robert Rodriguez' Desperado, Walter Hill's Last Man Standing, and the  Hughes brothers' Dead Presidents.  Tarantino seems to be the only filmmaker  Heard ever thinks of referring to, and his description of Woo's U.S. work  experiences are scanty to the point of being laughable.  What happened to  Woo in his private life in the U.S.?  No information.  Whom did he yell at,  fight with, come in contact with while in the &quot;New World&quot;?  The  book tells nothing.  Instead of valuable on-set experiences or interviews  with key personnel (eg. Terence Chang/Christopher Godsick; Oliver Wood, DP  for Face/Off; Chuck Pfarrer and Graham Yost, writers for Hard Target and  Broken Arrow, respectively; Peter Levy, DP for Broken Arrow and a host of  others), Heard goes into the most cliched Woo trivia such as who his  &quot;weapons expert&quot; is and what gun he used on Face/Off.  Not very  useful, in general, as to what kind of *filmmaker* Woo really is.  As for  his personal life...nothing whatsoever.  Though biographies on artists  should focus on their work, bios like J. Randy Taraborelli's Michael  Jackson:  The Magic and the Madness and Stephen Davis' Led Zeppelin  biography The Hammer of the Gods have proven that, in biographies, the art  and the person behind it can't be separated if a true representation is  sought.<br />I had made up a list of omissions, errors, ethnical mistakes (eg.  names -- &quot;Chow Yun-fat&quot;'s family name is &quot;Chow&quot;, but  Heard refers to him as &quot;Yun-fat&quot;, a common mistake) and general  ineptitudes that Heard included in his book.  The list has gone missing,  unfortunately, because I bought the book over half a year ago and never got  to review it until now.  Rest assured, if you try to use this book as a  factual resource, you will run into more pitfalls than you can  count.<br />This book would have received no stars at all if I hadn't taken  into account that this is so far the only biography that a 30-year film  veteran has received here.  So get it if you're interested in HK film and  Woo...but don't expect much from it.	1999-12-30

I'm in the precarious situation of not having seen the film but having read the screenplay about four times through already.  So treat this as a pure book review.<br />Kevin Smith's writing is entertaining, often very clean  (only seldom lapsing into the hyper-verbose ball and chain that many  screenwriters like Shane Black fall victim to).  Dogma may be one of the  few screenplays which a non-film person will be able to read just as a  dramatic work.  The dialogue sometimes gets to be as dense as in a novel,  which leads me to wonder how much of the script ended up on the cutting  room floor, but the concepts are intriguing and the characters highly  charged.  Unfortunately the last portion of the plot is incredibly dense  and hard to follow.  But as befits a Kevin Smith film/screenplay, once you  buy into his sense of humour, Dogma is very entertaining indeed, without  the cranial deficiency that so many indie screenplays suffer from.	1999-12-30

These photographs have an unnatural explicitness to them which threatens to dehumanize their subjects.  It's true that Roy Stuart's work is not &quot;prudish&quot; (as the book jacket proclaims:  &quot;A depiction of  animal sexuality free of all prudishness&quot;), but on the other hand they  also straddle the line of taste.<br />That said, some of the subjects of this  collection do come across as human beings, and the best photos in this book  are the ones where, instead of performing, the models project a sense of  real feeling.  (&quot;Initiation&quot;, though exploitative, does convey a  powerful sense of helplessness but also the strength of temptation)<br />Not  as aggressively idiosyncratic (or sickly violent) as Richard Kern, but  certainly more sensual.	1999-11-02

The last issue of the French edition of Photo did a very interesting juxtaposition:  A pictorial featuring three pictorials of violence (the  Indonesian genocide commited by Dayaks being particularly  harrowing)...followed by a Laetitia Casta pictorial.  After the grisly  shots of the Dayaks and their victims, it was like a whole different world  in the Casta pictorial -- one of the sweetest-looking faces in  fashion.<br />This book offers mostly photos available from other sources.   With a clear approach targeting fans smitten with Laetitia's looks (marks  for lack of pretension towards something more serious), this book is a nice  overview of a supermodel who doesn't fall into the Cindy Crawford trap (too  much pouting, zero sincerity -- the Crawford specialty).  On the other  hand, it has no guiding principle and no material that is not previously  published.<br />Laetitia's own charcoal scribbles and comments are highly  charming (her comments on nudity and seduction, for example).  The  strongest photos in the book are those by the one who, I think, understands  her appeal the most:  Dominique Isserman, one of the first photographers to  use Laetitia frequently for sessions.<br />The book has a limited scope,  obviously; it does get across Casta's strongest trait, which is the ability  to convey a sense of herself as a flesh-and-blood person -- some kind of  personal, emotional communication, instead of the empty glamour that most  models project.	1999-10-23

As Michael Powell once said of Martin  Scorsese:  &quot;He knows that when you're dead, you begin to smell.&quot;   This book shows that sense in visuals.<br />Sickening, repulsive,  sensationalistic.  The very book itself is as vile as the realities it  depicts.  As much as I acknowledge its evocative power, I feel compelled to  condemn its intentions.	1999-10-04

It's a real shame that Jack London coupled one of his most fascinating and full-blooded characters with a stinker of a love story which carries no conviction.<br />Maud Brewster, like many of London's female characters (from  Skeet, Curly and Mercedes in The Call of the Wild to Beth, Alice and Collie  in White Fang), is underdeveloped, a mite hysterical, and completely  dependent on the male characters.  Without much in terms of psychological  complexity, Maud provides a poor, poor reason for Humphrey Van Weyden to  rebel against Wolf Larsen.<br />The first half of this book and its final few  chapters are superb because London's male characters and their struggles  are vividly portrayed.  The knife-whetting contest between Mugridge and  Hump; the homoerotic segment where Hump tends to a naked and wounded  Larsen; Johnson and Leach's struggle against Larsen's iron fist -- London  obviously loves these characters and gives them the light of day.  Maud is  another story.<br />In any event, the first half of this book is the top-notch  tale of a Miltonic hero's slow slide from power, and the ending a moving  fulfillment of this character's destiny (life, in the end, *is* yeast...but  a savagely active and beautiful yeast, at that).  Another one of London's  terrible worlds unfolding its brutal majesty before us -- and, of course,  another book inexplicably relegated to the children's section of many a  book store.	1999-06-01
US	52009381	R11CLIAW2S0B1X	0446310786	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Untouchable in stature, intimate in its approach.	Superlatives no longer mean much to this venerable classic, one of the best novels ever written.  So I'm more interested in describing what makes the book work.<br />Humour is one crucial factor.  By never succumbing to the  pretentious grandiosity that has plagued many a novelist since the form's  rise to prominence in the Victoria era, To Kill a Mockingbird achieves an  endearing relationship with its reader.  Every character is vivid, with  strengths and faults, and Lee achieves that difficult amalgam in  first-person narratives presented as recollections:  A mixture of an  adult's rhetorical power and a child's keen, curious eye.  The language is  fresh and unburdened by the moralizing which frequently cripples prose  narrative (especially books which deal with sensitive issues as this one  does).<br />Lee made a perfect choice in personalizing a socio-political  issue.  To Kill a Mockingbird is predominantly the coming-of-age story of  Jem and Scout Finch, and the themes of racism, injustice, conservatism and  the Depression are all the better served this way.  Issues do not come  alive except through the living, breathing experience of their participants  and Scout Finch's particular take on the events of this book only makes  those events gain in moral strength, not diminish.<br />Boo Radley, Atticus  Finch, Scout and Jem, Miss Maudie...the characters of this book have  achieved an iconic status rare in modern literature.  And it has achieved  this not by making them Nietzschean uebermenschen, but by entering into  their lives with fair, enthusiastic frankness.  And to end off, this is one  of only a handful of truly successful negotiations between the dramatic  (eg. theatre, screenwriting) and the narrative (eg. prose narrative,  filmmaking, folk storysongs) I can think of.  Lee's dialogue is sharp  enough, and immediate enough, that even if we pared this book down to just  its dialogue and situations, we'd end up with a remarkably powerful play.   As it stands now, it's a truly successful crossover, its dramatic  situations and character interactions every bit as convincing as the  engrossing power of its storytelling.<br />I am all for challenging the canons  of all artistic forms, but this one is about as close to perfect as I've  seen a novel come, ranking right up there with the greatest of the greats.   It has its weak chinks -- Atticus' misunderstanding of Heck Tate's point in  the second-last chapter is befuddling, for example, but these are so minute  that to dwell on them would be overkill.  Thematically worthy to be called  an American epic, this book never forgets the personal in light of the  social.  We should be grateful it was ever written.	1999-05-27
US	52009381	R387VK6AVES931	0553212338	900054889	The Call of the Wild and White Fang	Books	5	5	7	N	N	How'd London end up in the children's section?	Jack London has his faults -- prone to overuse of superlatives; overdescription and overemphasis; occasional suggestions of misanthropy; an uneasy blend of aristocratic intellectualism and socialist populism.  But  not that many writers can match his linguistic energy, and at his best his  writings achieve a majesty and intensity akin to the cinematic mode of  expression.<br />White Fang is the better story, despite London scholar Andrew  Sinclair's protestations to the contrary.  Criticizing the  &quot;bathos&quot; of the ending, he probably missed the cynicism that can  be extracted from the &quot;Blessed Wolf&quot; ending.  Human recognition  doesn't mean much in the end of White Fang, after all -- notice that London  does not end on the note of &quot;Blessed Wolf&quot; but on the more  important thing -- rejuvenation, the next generation...the puppies.  This  is the true triumph of the wolf, not the acceptance of the Sierra  Vista.<br />White Fang succeeds on the strength of its coming-of-age story and  because White Fang is less heroic than Buck.  Buck in The Call of the Wild  is almost too powerful to be convincing -- his defeat at the hands of The  Man in the Red Sweater makes his devastation of the Yeehat tribe at the end  of the novella incredible.  However, Sinclair's criticisms of Jack London  taking liberties with dog behaviour (eg. Buck's &quot;imagination&quot;  while fighting; White Fang's electric-cars-as-screaming-lynxes nightmares)  verge on the idiotic.  The use of allusions (as in the case of the  nightmares) is an ages-old and very effective device; as for Buck's  &quot;imagination&quot;, I would rather trust London to comment on dog  behaviour than Sinclair.  Besides, who cares?  The novel was never designed  to be a hard-line news-journalistic form, so to criticize a novel for  &quot;not being realistic&quot;, especially in the case of a modern  mythmaker like London, is ridiculous.<br />The savagery of these two stories  makes it baffling whythey frequently end up in the children's section.   Shocking, powerful storytelling set in a merciless world.	1999-05-27

Black and white photos may be all the rage for people who want poetic images, but Illuminations contains some of the most surreal, breathtakingly beautiful images I've ever seen.

Clover has a way of incorporating politics into her aesthetic analyses (something most scholars cannot balance properly, preferring to favour one over the other).
