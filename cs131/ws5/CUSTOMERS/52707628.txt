However,  most of the stories in here are pretty cliched, uninspiring and sappy  descriptions of problems that came nowhere near to the depth I was needing  and hoping for.  For teenagers who are dealing with tough issues, this book  can make you feel more alone because it seems that no one who contributed  to the book went through anything particularly serious.  With a few  exceptions, this book remains a frivolous and meaningless description of  Brady Bunch problems in a serious world.	1999-07-02

There's the necessary murder/s, a  semi-feasible plot, and, may I say, quite a turn of events that lead up to  capturing the killer.  Such a turn that no one--unless they've cheated and  read to the end--will guess the murderer.  But the thing that hinders me  from giving this book a complete five stars is a matter of sheer  detail.<br />It seems Christie felt the need to accentuate the foriegn-ness  (if there is such a word) of her characters.  Poirot has  uncharacteristically halted speech, Hastings is ridiculously British, and  the French police are fumbling in their splotchy and nonsensical English.  This makes for a trying read.  However, if you can wade through the  ridiculous parts and find the meat of the story, you'll find a suitable  mystery.  Not the best of our Agatha, but certainly worth a look.	1998-09-07

However, my fears were unallayed.  This book is in no comparison to  'Postern of Fate', the last book featuring this daring duo, and also one of  few mysteries of Agatha that entirely lacks a plot.<br />From the first  pages, the story has a tightly woven plot that toils for more of a surprise  effect than realism.  Reminiscent of 'The Big Four', another fantastically  interesting mystery, 'The Secret Adversary' is made for those seeking  adventure in their lives, not a feasible plot.<br />With Christie swinging  her signature style of convincing you the murderer really IS the other  person (when in reality it is the man on the right), nothing could be more  of a thriller and relaxing story than 'Secret Adversary'.  My suggestion:  read this.  After all, there's practically a money-back guarantee you'll  like it.	1998-09-05

Poirot is at his most delightful in this book, Hastings at his most cocky-turned-bumbling self, and the cast of characters the epitome of classic mystery.  <br />The Mysterious Affair also proves that Christie knew from the start what made a mystery shocking and complex.  The plot structure, one that has been used in at least one other book, is one of the more ingenious takes on mystery writing.  It is only second to that which was used in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Endless Night. <br />I can find nothing wrong with this book.  While not the best out of her work, this is certainly a very good example of Golden Age mystery--it virtually defines the term.  A perfect example for those searching for Golden Age and all Christie/mystery lovers.	1998-08-02

There's no exotic twist or fleeing of the heroine to some faraway island.  This is just a cut, dried, and hung plot.<br />Agatha puts you in the position of suspecting a few certain people.  You become positive that you've at last unmasked the ending, but it just isn't so.  In fact, Christie reverses the rule of the least-suspected person being the murderer.  After all, if you immediately suspect the inconspicuous person, doesn't that then make them conspicuous?  Enough.  But anyway, Lord Edgware Dies is a good mystery and has a nice ending.  It's all you can ask for in that department.	1998-07-31

Christie so turned her talents of genius and sheer horror up to full speed that I would consider this one of her very best works.  <br />Don't be disappointed because you know Poirot dies in this one.  There is much more bite to the story than that.  The reason that he dies, the method of the murderer, and the ways a few of the victims die are clearly a combination between the genius and craftmanship seen in 10 Little Indians and the creativity and shock effect known so well in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.  This book will reaffirm your admiration and acceptance of just how complex and INCREDIBLE Agatha Christie was.	1998-07-20

The premise for the book was duly intriguing, with perhaps one of the more creative plot ideas to boot.  The sleuths were intelligent and delightful, the possible murderers all sufficiently suspicious, and the victim a person who played his role to the nines.<br />Dame Agatha made a point to say during the prologue that because you knew right away who the four possible murderers were, the element of surprise during the unmasking would be slightly less than if suspicion were cast on a whole room-full of people.  True, perhaps, although not the common thread in ALL mediums.  <br />Cards on the Table, despite its aforesaid lack of surprise, does manage a neat, nice, maybe even SHOCKING unmasking of the murderer. It has no qualms about turning you around, giving you the classic Christie twist that makes you suspect each of the four in turn--and all in one chapter!  You then realize that the true murderer is none other than the per! son you least suspected most--and that is perhaps one reason why Poirot was known to say it was his FAVORITE case, after all.	1998-07-18

It travels slowly and with caution, yet is nontheless sinister, with all the undertones of greed, evil and black thoughts one book could have.  <br />Poirot receives a cryptic letter from a deceased old woman, who obviously suspected her death to be close at hand--and anything but natural.  It is only the stubborn Poirot who believes it to really be a murder, while everyone else looks at a very natural death as just that.  The tension builds as there are no lack of suspects and WILLING murderers--the question is, who would actually go through with it and at the same time had the ability to make the murder appear natural to every single person--doctor and all?  <br />Because there are so few characters, the ending is not such a shock since at least for me, since I had suspected the murderer anyway.  However, it is interesting to listen as Poirot explains how/why the murder was committed.  I was actual! ! ly surprised during some of his explanation of the impossible--or seemingly impossible.  <br />I would recommend this book.  It held a rather gentle grasp of me, forcing me to read the whole thing in a day.  The other good aspect of this mystery was a few obvious clues laid down in the path.  These were extremely valuable clues, and whether Agatha intended them to be so obvious or not they were none the less there.  Most anyone should pick these clues up.  And if you are lucky, and have a good grasp of poisonous substances, you might just solve the entire thing.	1998-07-16

The heroine, Kinsey Millhone, sports a name that you know Grafton made up to give the reader the sense that maybe  her characters have some individuality--that not all of them are carbon copies of each other.  Of course, that move only makes things a little more artificial.  Likewise, the character of Millhone is your typical heroine--irritatingly plucky and feministic complete with an unnessecery attitude and foul mouth.  <br />However, Grafton does manage to create a few characters that you can actually welcome to the story--Henry Pitts and Arlette are a few.  And she manages to make a reasonable development of most, surprisingly enough considering her huge cast of players.  <br />I was almost surprised when I finished the book.  Thinking this would actually be worse than a Mary Higgins Clark novel, I found that there were a few spots of talent and a couple of plot twists I wasn't really expecting.  All in all, I won't read Grafton again.  I knew that from the start, almost.  But if you intend to read mediocre pulp fiction, this is not a bad place to start.	1998-07-12

The motive to the murder was legitimate and you feel almost sympathy with the murderer.  The conclusion is summed up in a few words--nothing too complicated like One, Two, Buckle My Shoe or others.  And you needn't feel confused or tied up in a tangle of evidence and clues--those are few and far between.  <br />If you are a fan of the sinister or like your mysteries dark and complicated, this simply isn't your cup of tea.  I have to admit, although I don't always like the simple, pleasant mysteries, that Christie knew what she was doing.  Can you see Miss Marple chasing after a serial killer across continents wielding an assault rifle and going down in hand-to-hand combat?  No, never.  So Christie was wise and keeps her characters in their natural habitats doing realistic things.  That way she knew her mysteries and her detectives would receive respect and credulity--quite important for the success of her books.	1998-07-12

It combines the classic English murder mystery with a nursery rhyme to produce a mystifying turn of events.  <br />I am not overly fond of Miss Marple, but I have to admit that she performs delightfully well in this book.  It is with the most acute of minds that Christie uses another nursery rhyme to carryout her murders--there is that sense of inevitability and pattern that comes along with it.  <br />Christie is a master of the classic and cutting-edge.  This is one of her better classics.	1998-07-11

However, I think that Dame Agatha didn't go out to lunch in this one--she just wrote a book that falls in closely to real life.<br />I have been a detective for 11 years and I can tell you that not every homicide has cutting edge action.  There are tiresome investigations, questioning, dead-end leads, and many more things that would lull any human to sleep.  Christie must have known that sometimes things aren't that interesting and can't always be some cop and robber chase scene.  Miss Marple is merely taking things slowly (as she should--she's not young anymore) and gathering the evidence prudently.  <br />Perhaps Christie really did have a dry spell and this was the result of it.  She may not have been trying to make a realistic book.  In any event, the fact is this book is realistic, by chance or purpose it matters not.	1998-07-11

It is this question that reminds you that a spiral does not end.  It twists and curves towards infinity.  It is ever so clear that Christie knew that.  So, when you come to wondering if the story is over yet, if all the &quot;evil&quot; really IS dead, then know that it is not a hole, a flaw in the dense tapestry--it is merely the continuing spiral.  It is some loss that Christie never chose to continue that spiral in another work...but perhaps she knew that it would be better to leave all alone.  <br />Some other readers found this to be an unwelcome flight from murder mystery.  Even if you are an indelible fan of who done it's, you should still take time to appreciate the intelligence with which this book is written.  It is like a lumberjack strolling peacefully through the woods, leaving his saw in the trunk.  Just take some time out and witness perfection, even if you are opposed to it.	1998-07-10

Prejudice is such an easy yet widely abused topic because one can be sure that no matter how profane and juvenile their writing is, they will get some sort of critical praise if they attack the nature of hating another for non-exsistent reasons.  <br />It is so in Snow Falling on Cedars.<br />The novel is so exhausting in its obvious efforts to make the reader irate and angry at the social injustices painted so crudely in the plot.  You can almost witness Gutterson's mind at work, devising clever little traps and cruelties that are meant to hang on your heart-strings.  He incorporates little vignettes on the side to appear like a puppet-master pulling the plot slowly inward.  And lastly, he adds a Higgins Clark touch to the ending to give his lower-IQ readers an extra thrill.  In short, Gutterson is a used car salesman eagerly pushing his trashy product into critics' faces.<br />The reason this is so plainly obvious to people is because if Gutterson truly wanted to talk about prejudice, honestly wanted to portray it in some way, then he wouldn't strive to the lowest writing standards to do it.  Instead, he would search for some insight, some knowledge and then realize that when he had none, he would need to search for a new plot.<br />This book is loud, obnoxious, and stuck in a reality of wax figures living in a forgotten mural.  It is not another writer we need in this world.  We just need someone to at last get in touch with reality.	1998-07-10

The plot runs off of a much more dramatic and insightful classic, Flaubert's Madame Bovary.  The stories are the same:  a woman, dissatisfied with her station in life, seeks happiness in an unorthodox way (namely a man) that entirely displeases her relatives and friends.  The only difference is that Flaubert gives his heroine a realistically tragic end, while Forster opts for the happy, fairytale finale.<br />It is this unoriginality, lack of plot depth, and dialogue reminiscent of a Hans Christian Anderson story that makes A Room With a View dissatisfying. Forster obviously felt the need to contribute a story that, with its tiresome protagonists and only somewhat interesting antagonists, would teach future writers one thing:  change a famous writer's denouement around and you can gain all the fame and merit you could want off one piece of literature.<br />Holly Burke, PhD.<br />Georgetown U.	1998-07-08

The similarities between Flaubert's Madame Bovary and Chopin's The Awakening is more than I can ignore.  Take the plot, for instance.  Married woman finds herself bored and dissatisfied with her station in life.  Woman seeks man for satisfaction, enjoys herself guiltily for a while, then relationship ends.  Woman becomes despondent for a while, realizes she will never become happy so ends it with suicide.<br />It is this basic idea that haunts both Madame Bovary and The Awakening.  There are a few trivialities that are different, but the plot of Chopin's is entirely unoriginal.	1998-07-08

At a time where most writers wrote in a stuffy prose full of unrealities and a jaded outlook, Dickens dares to tell with honesty what he sees through his window.  <br />Hard Times has yet a misleading title.  It gives one ideas of harshness, depression, poverty, and social decline--although the actual reality of then-London, still not something you would choose to read.  However, Hard Times has as much depression and poverty as any of Dickens' other works.  It is just in this case that Dickens chooses to remind the world that in the deepest despair there is beauty yet to be seen.  <br />Dickens was a strange author.  In his supposedly inspiring books, you get an overdose of sadness, and in his depressing books, you find beauty.  It is this case with Hard Times.  <br />It is a poor, honest man's search for justice in a world where only the rich have merit.  It is a girl's search for true love while battling the arranged marriage for money.  And lastly, a woman's search for recognition against her favored, yet dishonest brother.  It is these searches that at last come together and become fufilled.  And, while at the same time telling a captivating story, it comments on the then--and still now--presence of greed and total dishonesty one has to go through for money.  <br />The title of this review sums up Hard Times.  Its beauty comes from the pure searches for truth, the sorrow comes from the evil the characters most overcome to get there, and the honesty is both the truth with which Dickens portrays life and the the overwhelming truth that these protaganists create.<br />Holly Burke, PhD.<br />Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych.

Dickens' tedious descriptions and constant indecision on how the plot should turn makes the novel lose it's potential merit.  <br />Thousands of scholars and other readers have lauded Great Expectations as the finest Dickens' work of all time.  The fact remains that it appears Dickens could not decide whether to make this a tragedy or an &quot;all's well that ends well&quot; happy-go-lucky type of story.  This is proven by his change of the original ending.  However, any reader could give testimony of feeling &quot;yanked, strung along, or thrown about&quot; from page one as they wonder just what Dickens wants them to think about Pip and his less-than remarkable life.  Should we sympathize, feel disgust, be concerned? Does he deserve Estella's scorn or is he a victim of circumstance?<br />The more you read of this cryptic novel the more you grow to understand that Dickens doesn't know what his novel is about, either.  The entire book seems to vary by the chapter.  And the fact that the plot has a potentially good story behind it that Dickens doesn't care to elaborate on makes the entire thing a bit more tedious for the take. <br />The fact remains that Dickens is a fabulous story-teller.  He has accurate, unjaded descriptions, refreshing, occassionally bitter, sometimes triumphant plots, and enough suspense to keep you reading throughout the night.

The fact that this has to do with a school and the possibility of the murderer being one of the children was paticularly horrifying--but not out of Dame Christie's reach.  <br />In fact, I was expecting this to be focused on a more psychological view-point, something reminiscent of Endless Night or Crooked House.  However, this was nothing more than a harmless novel with  murder, murderer, and motive--the only difference its being in a school.

First of all, I say you SHOULD read this book because, well, you should.  It's not a matter of wanting to, it's just something that, if you're a Christie reader (even a little bit), you should force yourself to read this.  (Kinda' like the obligation you have as a human being to read The Catcher in the Rye before you die.) <br />The reason I recommend this so strongly is because while I don't think this is exactly her BEST book, it probably has the best ending, psychologically speaking.  This truly exemplifies pure evil.  <br />Crooked House falls in the catagory that Endless Night and a few others inhabit--those books you wouldn't call superb, but have the acute awareness of human nature and the human pysche that all of her other books lack in somewhat.  <br />So, in short, I would read this.  The end will perhaps horrify you, but you must nontheless give in to it.  It might remind you that evil inhabits all of us, no matter who we are.  <br />Holly Burke, PhD.

When traces of poison are found in the cup of pure &quot;black coffee&quot; the english gent was drinking, none other than Hercule Poirot, hero and mastermind of many of Christie's mysteries, is called in to assist.<br />Poirot has a houseful of suspects and little time to pinpoint the true killer and motive in a sea of possibilities.  What seems like an impossible case turns out to be, as usual, a simple thread in a tangle of lies which is unravelled with a little common sense and sheer logic. <br />While not quite as complex and complicated as some of Christie's books, Black Coffee serves up a quintessential english atmosphere alongside a flawless murder/mystery--with none other than the self-satisfied (and of course amusing) Poirot busy excersising his &quot;little grey cells&quot;.<br />This is a fantastic and extremely enjoyable play, which, whether you choose to read it or go see it performed, will ignite or even reignite a passion of Agatha Christie.	1998-07-04

You have all of Sherlock Holmes at your fingertips, no searching aimlessly in a dimly-lit shop for the non-exsistent stories. You can skip and skim and get totally invovled in the stories for as long as you need, and, the selling point for me...........it's virtually INEXPENSIVE!!!  I love Christie and Doyle and to me, this was a godsend.  One quick order and I have it all.  Not, however, like Christie...<br />Back to signing away my life -- and all for a complete set of Christie.  If only everything could be as easy as Holmes.	1998-07-02

Books	5	0	2	N	N	A TWISTING, CURLING TALE OF SUSPENSE	The ability to be inncocent and yet a murderer...<br />Take this statement into consideration while reading the book.  The fact that most people can't consider a nice, innocent, politically correct person evil is the big stumbling block of the novel.<br />I think that Christie's biggest asset in writing successful mysteries is her ability to create amazing red herrings.  It is the red herring that the unsuspecting reader bites into and won't let go until the gentle and ingenious Christie pries it out with her rock-hard proof of who the real murderer is.  <br />It is proved once again that the red herring can work in this novel.  It all starts with innocence...then leads up to contemplation, suspicion, and proof.  You will find out evidence as the protagonists do and feel the excitement as they stake out undercover the suspect/s.  So don't be deceived by appearances.  Like in most cases, the people that seem flawless and wonderfully caring turn out to be a little different.  Reader, beware!  Nothing is how it looks.<br />Enjoy, Holli Burke PhD.	1998-06-30

Well, I think it is the fact that I was a little bored towards the middle.  It's typical for me, a die-hard Poirot fan, to feel weariness with Miss Marple.  <br />But other than that this was a good story.  You at once feel sure that one of the characters is the murderer.  Despite your former knowledge of Christie's famous red herrings, you jump unmercifully into accusations and assumptions.  Of course, the most suspected person is never the murderer.  And once you do get rock-hard proof of the real !guy!, you feel almost ashamed.  After all, isn't that such a big fall-out when we are so quick to believe?  <br />I wouldn't say that this is at all Christie's best work.  However, it does fall in that large basin of pretty goods and mediocres.  Thank God, though, that there are more fantastics than absolutely terribles.  That's just Christie's beautiful (and sinister) mind. <br />Holli Burke, PhD.	1998-06-30
US	52707628	R32427TJBF0BH2	0425091805	653534023	Three Act Tragedy (Hercule Poirot Mysteries)	Books	3	4	5	N	N	I WAS DISAPPOINTED	When buying this book, the plot summary sounded intriguing.  Two vctims get killed in exactly the same way, so Poirot sets up a dinner party of his own.  It turned out that this was actually a rather tedious book.<br />First of all, Poirot only really comes into the story during the last half.  Christie should've learned that putting the stars behind the scenes is all wrong.  After all, that's why &quot;The Body in the Library&quot; was so boring. <br />Then most of the mystery is a group of amateurs looking around for the murderer.  You have long dialouges, pointless discussions, all of which make things boring. You have the odd-ball match of two of the characters and find yourselves tangled up in their love affair.  Frankly, although I love a good romance, this was just annoying.  <br />The best part comes when Poirot stages his said dinner party to uncover the murderer.  You're not sure what proof he has found, but as usual, he's found something.  However, by that point, I'd guessed the murderer.  I usually have a theory, although it's never been found correct.<br />So, hoping for a good ending, I discover that I HAD guessed the right person!  What a disappointment.  So here's my clue:  if you go ahead and buy this anyway, think SMALL.  Most of the time you never think big enough for Christie's plot, but this time the murderer, motive (which is a big issue in this book), and discovery has small and petty reasoning behind it.  In fact, the whole murders could've been avoided, quite easily.   Oh well.  It's not too bad--in fact the end shocked me since I was expecting such a grande finale.	1998-06-29

The way the mystery is solved, by just a chance occurance, is so realistic that those who hated &quot;The Big Four&quot; for it's lack of realism will appreciate this edition from Dame Agatha.  <br />In fact, the whole book is full of realism, excepting how the murderer chose to claim its victims.  I guess the realism is the deciding factor for this book.  Did you like &quot;The Big Four&quot;, or do you prefer the who-dun-its?  This isn't the best, but it's far from the worst!!!	1998-06-29

The fact that the murderer put too many clues in the plot make the ending and denouement a twisty, spiraling set of events that may make you read it twice just to make sure you have it all.  <br />It's a wonder that something so simple (a dentist's apparent suicide) could actually have so many motives behind it.  There is a word of warning here:  if you tend to like dark, dangerous criminals with suspicious pasts, don't read this. You might find yourself feeling a sort of empathy with the criminal, and may be rooting for Poirot to let him off the hook.  Well, if I haven't said too much already, I will soon.  So, so long and farewell.  Do read this, though, when you're ready to sit down and concentrate on trite and complicated details.	1998-06-29

The plot dragged, the story was far from suspenseful, and you felt a heavy obligation to read to the end.

Flip on the lights, take a quick, furtive glance around, and set about storing this major bummer away...just so no innocent victims get in the way. <br />First of all the problem with the book (a big one it is, as well) is that it has no mystery.  Considering it is a mystery book, you would think Agatha would remember that point.  Well, when Tommy &amp; Tuppence fall upon an inscription in a book that slightly resembles a fuzzy scandal-murder, they chase after a hare's nest like wildfire.  It turns out this gigantic goose chase is virtually the novel you see before your eyes.  You go through red tape, pointless discussions, and the tracking down of something that--get this--doesn't exsist (anymore, at least)!  <br />Well, after a long and tedious journey, you've reached virgin territory--the end.  You find yourself praying for a fulfilling ending...but like the plot, there is none.  Instead you get a hazy, boring, confusing resolution that looks more like a cleverly put trap of beloved de ja vu.  So, in short, DON'T READ IT!	1998-06-28

This had the classic elements of Christie mystery--lies, deception, adventure, murders.  A rather unorthodox mystery, each chapter contains spellbinding twists that go to the outer level of Christie's mind.  You come to the point where you are unsure what to believe...  Poirot is on the trail of the most intelligent and crafty criminal minds there are.  Their only blockade is none other than Poirot--the only man with a mind equal to theirs.  What makes this such a great book is that each side has to attempt to out-wit each other, and frankly, that's just fascinating.  I don't know why everyone else hated this book.  I thought it was so exciting I couldn't put it down--I read it the day I got it.  At least try it.  Everywhere else I looked, this book got stellar reviews.	1998-06-25
