Having just finished it again I realized that there were so many things I didn't understand before.  This is the story of Wang Lung, land owner in China.  The \\"good earth\\" is really a metaphor for Wang, who suffers and prospers along with the land.  Wang begins to lose himself when he begins to put the wealth the land brings before the land itself.<br /><br />Unlike the earth, Wang doesn't always appreciate the \\"rain\\" of good fortune, like a faithful and dedicated wife who labors to support his every move, raises his children, cares for his aging father.  Yet he considers her as almost unintelligent.  Because she is often silent, he does not hear her strength.  What I had never noticed before was that Wang forgot that the \\"good earth\\" was his fortune.  He began to change, and he never realized it, not even at the end.  Wang becomes angry with his elder son because he falls in love with money, but he never realizes that his son learned this from Wang himself, when Wang began to store up riches, all the while believing that he was being faithful to the land.  Money becomes his mistress and he protitutes himself to it.  It is no wonder, then, that his sons have no love for the land, no respect for the earth from which they came.  They see only that the land can be harsh, from their year of suffering in a drought.  They see only the plenty that comes from wealth.  They never want to be hungry again.  So where Wang sees food coming from the earth, they see uncertainty.  And as long as there is money, they feel safe.  The irony is that Wang Lung has also shared this experience, and his awakening toward the end of the book comes to late for his sons.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It is well written (the author's many prizes speak for themselves) and, if it's been a long time since you read it, worthwhile reading again.	2005-01-23

This book appears to be a text book for Biblical study.  The &quot;Top 100 Reviewer&quot; who was upset about the use of abbreviations for the titles of books of the Bible seems never to have read commentaries before, where this is always the case.  A commentary does not read like a regular book.  Perhaps the reviewer will realize that his review was colored by the fact that he just didn't realize what type of book he was reading.	2004-06-21

I had put off reading it after seeing so many bad reviews on this site.  I understand the frustration of some readers who wish the action would pick up.  I would like to see the series end soon, too, but I didn't think this book was so bad.  There is plot development.  The charcters are growing (albiet slowly) and maturing.  I'm glad Mat finally met his future wife; it was a long time coming.  I wish Jordan would write more about Perrin; he's by far the best charcter.  I don't think I'll wait so long to read Book 10, but, Mr. Jordan, have pity on us.  I enjoy long stories, but can't you end it soon?  I'd love to know how it ends.	2003-12-22

I was really happy to see her continue this series, as I enjoyed the original three books.  But what happened?  I agree with one reviewer that it doesn't even seem like McCaffrey's writing.

Mary of Magdala, Peter, Andrew, Stephen: they're all so very real when seen through the author's eyes.  We can feel sorrow and joy, excitement and fear through these well known people.<br />It's also difficult to fill in the blanks left in the Scriptures.  Maybe we're meant to imagine what goes in the blanks.  Just what were the seven demons expelled from Mary of Magdala?  Who was Stephen?  Why was he martyred?  What did he do to get the attention of Saul?  And what about Saul?  We know what motivated him-he tells us in his own letters.  And we know the followers of the Way found it very hard to trust him in the beginning.  Seeing all of this action unfold in this novel really helps put some flesh onto the Acts of the Apostles.<br />Religious fiction at its best should make one want to turn to the Scriptures, to read and pray again over the messages to be found there now that we have become friends with the people we read about.<br />I own the second book in this series and I'm looking forward to it.  I hope it's as good as this one.	2003-02-14

I went to see the movie and was so caught up in the story that I ordered the book ... right away.<br />First of all, the book is true to the screenplay, down to dialogue, although there were some additions and adjustments in the novelization.  It was also a plus to have the introduction and commentary on the making of the movie at the end.<br />I find it hard to accept that this might really be the end of \\"The Next Generation,\\" and yet I don't see how they could come together again after this movie.  I mean, you could bring all the actors together and have a good script, but as a fan, having now watched these characters evolve, and move on, it would be like watching your kids move back home.<br />The novel did fill in some spots I felt a bit confused about, explaining certain bits of dialogue, especially lines by Worf.<br />I felt the book was very well written.  Congratulations.	2003-01-30

I just couldn't get past the first couple of chapters. I read the first three or four books one right after the other; I couldn't get enough of the story. But then, enough already. I wanted to go on vacation somewhere else.<br />After a little space and time, I picked up book 8, \\"The Path of Daggars\\" and am enjoying it greatly. Sometimes you have to go away for awhile and spend some time with some other characters. Then you can appreciate Jordan's detailed writing, the annoying charcteristics of the characters (I wish Nynaeve would stop pulling on that damned braid, and the men stop wondering when they will understand women!) and the delicious intrigue which makes this series worth the time it takes to read.	2002-11-23

Defending the Catholic faith doesn't have to be so rigid.

It's like saying the second kiss is the same as the first: it can never live up to the memory.  This said, Good Harbor is a totally different experience than Ms. Diamant's first novel, &quot;The Red Tent.&quot;<br />The beginning chapters before Kathleen, school librarian, recently diagnosed with breast cancer, and Joyce, frustrated serious writer who's just penned a &quot;sleazy&quot; romance novel, meet were a little difficult for me to follow.  I found that I couldn't tell which woman was which, but I think that had more to do with me than with the author.  Each of these women is in desperate need of a close friend.  Joyce and Kathleen are lonely, in long-standing marriages that only slightly feed their intimacy needs.  They are mothers in different stages, trying their best to be loving parents and spouses.<br />We live with them as they share their story with each other.  Good Harbor becomes a character in the story, a welcoming, non-judgmental haven where Kathleen and Joyce feel safe to tell of their sorrows and joys and disappointments.<br />It's not a perfect novel.  The story sometimes drags, and I would find myself hoping to come to a better place in the story.  The better place always came after a short time.  Ms. Diamant is a very good writer; there were some beautifully poetic lines.  The other characters in her story often suffer from lack of development, but after all, it is the story of Joyce and Kathleen.<br />We should continue to watch Ms. Diamant for more women's stories.	2001-12-10

I followed Mr. Bradshaw's suggestion to work with a therapist, and although it might not have been my therapist's choice for me, we both agreed that the work was sound and the healings lasting.<br />I could see how it might not work for everyone, because you have to be ready to see your wounded self and not just have pity on you. Parenting your inner child is hard work, because we are constantly tempted to have tantrums instead of moving beyond the stuff in our childhoods that makes us react instead of act.<br />I only did the meditations at the time I was going through the book, but occasionally through the years, I have read the things I wrote in my journal, and I know that I have embraced the wounded part of me. It worked.<br />I found it excellent, and not difficult to follow. But you have to be ready to deal with yourself and your past. If you're not, then I suspect it's not yet time to read this book. If you are ready, this is a most excellent tool.	2001-09-26

US	50801329	R13MGW57HOUZR9	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Great Book	Any time an author writes about even marginal biblical characters, it is hard to know how it will be received. I can understand how some people might be offended by this book. I don't think I would recommend it everyone. Yet it is a very beautiful story of Dinah, only daughter of Jacob, sister to the Twelve Tribes of Israel.<br />The author has told a woman's story. Biblically, the Israelites do not yet exist at this point, since Jacob is to become Israel only after the birth of his sons. God was only beginning to reveal Himself to a family He was forming one son at a time.<br />It makes sense that at that time there were still many people who worshipped other gods, the Great Mother, etc. The place of woman in society was secondary to a man's. That the women would try to preserve what was theirs: their meeting place, the place where they were women together, where to be a woman was not a curse, is plausable. The fictional character Dinah is very believable. She tries to make the best of her situations, learns to suffer and rebuild her life. She triumphs.<br />It's a very well written story. I look forward to Ms. Diamant's next book.	2001-09-21

But his life will never be the same once he hears the name &quot;Willie Bodega&quot;.  Bodega has dreams for a future, a decent life, but he has other kinds of plans: using drug money instead of &quot;conventional&quot; methods in order to build his empire.  Bodega has dreams, of happiness with the woman he loves, even if she belongs to someone else.  He dreams that he is powerful, that he is adored, that he will somehow live forever.<br />Chino doesn't want to cross the line; he believes in honesty and integrity, but these are eroded slowly, so slowly that he doesn't realize it's happening until it's too late.  In the end, he realizes that once you touch fire, you can't help but be burned.

She knows he reads it and looks for his notes in her margins.  He hates the book.  She's angry with him.<br />Toward the end of the book, I got so confused regarding just what was happening to whom - was it Ferre's character, or her character's character?

I would have to disagree. I thought it was very descriptive regarding the horror that Fr. Emilio feels at what has happened to him. When he sets out on the expidition to this new planet, he believes he will discover beings who will be somehow similar to himself, and to humanity. He believes that God has created these beings and that he will be finding &quot;brothers&quot;, even if they may not look like him or think like him. Yet what he finds is so alien that everything he believes in is now in question. Furthermore, Fr. Emilio believes he will somehow discover the voice of God or the face of God on this far away planet, from which the most incredibly beautiful music can be heard. He does not find God; God has no place on this planet. He returns to earth, horrified at what he experienced, trying desperately to figure out what went wrong, to understand how his own actions, and those of his much-mourned friends, caused events to spiral out of control.<br />I am unsure how to rate this book. I was extremely disturbed by the story, which I suppose means the author did a good job writing her characters and bringing the reader into the pathos of her story; yet, I can not think of a single person to whom I would recommend this book. Take this for what it's worth: the writing is excellent, the story disturbing. Read at your own risk.	2001-09-09

I found the beginning a little tedious, because Mattie Blue launches often into paragraphs of lists: all the things of her mother's that she has away after the funeral, all the things she remembers about Nick, etc. But I knew if I just read on, I would become accustomed to Mattie Blue's style. It is important for an author who speaks in the voice of her character to give that character a unique voice. We learn early on the fate of Nick Blue, so we know this story is really about Mattie growing up, accepting a new and challenging life, truly finding herself and how she has learned to love. Finishing the book, I found myself sorry to see the story end. I eagerly await Ms. Fowler's next story.	2001-08-30

I don't know.  I think they are metaphors.  Ms. Perez uses magic and religion and mental illness as tools to tell a story about people who get lost because they don't live the the lives they really want to live.<br />While Iliana's intention to go home and help her family leads her back to her house, it's in her understanding that she can only live her own life and become who she WANTS to be, that she can really go home.	2001-08-18

I have always enjoyed Peter David's writing, his blending of seriousness and humor.<br /><br />Londo's story is very tragic because he never understood the consequences of his actions.  He never thought beyond what felt right to him at the moment.  Asking the Shadows to destroy G'Kar and the Narn, he didn't know the evil he was unleashing into the universe, or how he was destroying his own people in the process.  There were always hints of this tragedy in the series, but none so clear as the events described in this book.  You can feel sorry for Londo, and this is due to the great accomplishment of the author.  These books help to wrap up a wonderful series that changed the way we want to watch TV.  Very few shows have a beginning, a middle and an end in mind even before the show begins.  Congratulations to Peter David for helping to tell this compelling story.	2001-01-12

I am sorry to say that I was a little disappointed.  Although many parts of the book are really excellent, Ms. Norris spends too much time making commentary instead of just sharing the experience.  I really enjoyed when she shared how she was moved by prayer, to a point of conversion.  And how the experience of the cloister strengthened her sense of self, and her marriage.  But the chapter on St. Maria Goretti, while making a valid point, was overkill.  Still it is worth the effort through the tedious parts, for the nuggets of wisdom which are also to be found there.  My recommendation, skip over the platitudes and embrace the jewels.	2000-11-11

They are so enjoyable, and maybe unlike some people, I am so glad they go on for almost a thousand pages!  Diana Gabaldon has a real flare for writing romance, not just sex, for touching the sacred while keeping her characters real.  I thought that Claire accepted a little too readily her appearance in Scotland 200 years earlier, but after awhile, I forgot about that and accepted it, too.  The Jaime-Claire romance is so wonderful as a fantasy, but it also teaches us that real love is possible.  Sometimes, in order to accept fantasy, we have to suspend our desire to want everything to fall neatly into &quot;real&quot; boxes.  I can't wait for the next book to come out.	2000-09-29

This book is a story about overcoming the obstacles of the past: our mother's struggles, our fears, and the memories that come down to us from generation to generation which keep us from being truly human.  This is a parable,teaching us that it is better to live than to give up, that it is possible to overcome the things that kept us down in the past, and that it is necessary to forgive what others have done to us.  Only in forgiving and loving can we be free.  A great book!	2000-09-23

Dinah's story is told with the honesty of women  who have suffered and triumphed.  Anita Diamant's storytelling pulls the  reader into the story, so that when she speaks to us in the voice of her  characters, we are moved by a message of survival.  I hope Ms. Diamant  continues to write these stories for women of all time.	2000-09-12
