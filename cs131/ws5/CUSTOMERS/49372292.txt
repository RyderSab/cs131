US	49372292	R1MVRE32UKOQKV	0060002492	534292075	Amazonia	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Oustanding adventure novel from start to finish	James Rollins' fourth book, Amazonia, is the best of his first four published novels.  Like his previous three novels (Subterranean, Excavation, and Deep Fathom), all are robust, action-filled adventure stories centering around a major discovery.  Unlike Subterranean and Deep Fathom, Amazonia has a great finish after a big buildup.  Excavation is on par with Amazonia in this respect as both had fast starts, great buildup, and a great conclusion.<br />Amazonia centers around the discovery of something in the Amazon with regenerative capabilities.  A Special Forces agent stumbles into a small village at the beginning and the mystery surrounding the regeneration of his missing arm intrigues the US Government and Nathan Rand.  Rand's father was part of the original mission into the Amazon with Agent Clark as part of the US military support.<br />A new team of US Rangers is formed, aided by Rand and a few friends and scientists.  Their discoveries of strange new creatures and plantlife make for an interesting tale and one full of action and intrigue.  Although some of the action sequences are a bit farfetched, they are still entertaining.  The action is never as unbelievable as that of Matthew Reilly's books where the hero always seems to have what he/she needs at just the right moment, but it does stretch the imagination a bit.  <br />The fast-paced novel is a quick read that will entertain fans of Matthew Reilly, Steve Alten and other adventure writers.  The conclusion fits well within the story and wraps up the story neatly.  Fortunately, this ending is much better than that of Deep Fathom where the author seemed to not know how to end the story, which resulted in him basically \\"hitting the reset button\\" to conclude the story.  If you are a first time reader of Rollins, read Amazonia first followed by Excavation.	2003-07-03
US	49372292	RCDRGLA2TZ2NJ	0743400747	103888357	Star Trek - Gemini	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Average story, but with atmosphere of the original serie	&quot;Gemini&quot;, Mike Barr's first published Star Trek novel, has the feel of an episode of the original series.  However, unlike the original series episodes that were limited to 45 minutes to wrap up a storyline, this book went beyond its &quot;45 minutes&quot;.  There were elements of the story that didn't seem to fit, but other elements which captured the atmosphere of the original series.<br />The story revolves around Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise being sent to the planet Nador to assist in the population's vote on whether or not their planet should join the United Federation of Planets.  The leaders of the planet, conjoined twins named Abon and Delor, spearhead the effort to have their planet to join the alliance.  However, an underground faction that doesn't want their planet to join the Federation sets out to prohibit the vote.<br />The twins are soon under the protection of Kirk and his crew while the identity of the faction is attempted to be identified.  A side story involves Peter Kirk, the captain's nephew, but this story seems out of place and could have been omitted.  It was probably added to help round out Kirk's character, but the events that involve Peter have little to do with the outcome of the storyline.  The twins secret is a nice little twist and the reason behind the secret is true Star Trek.<br />Overall, if the part of Peter Kirk had been omitted from the story, or at least better entwined in it, the book would have been a better read.  Hopefully, future authors of Star Trek novels based on the original series can mimic the atmosphere of the series as well as Barr did in this one.  It is a good first effort from Barr and hopefully the beginning of a better series of novels after the recent relaunch of the original series in the novels.	2003-03-12
US	49372292	R1YNFO5HH24EE7	0786015373	405091504	Haunted Ground	Books	3	16	18	N	N	An average ghost story	Stephen Gresham, the author of many horror novels over the past fifteen years, has written a number of good novels (&quot;Moon Lake&quot;, &quot;Blood Wings&quot;), but only one that was below average (&quot;Dark Magic&quot;).  &quot;Haunted Ground&quot; is a ghost story that Gresham had wanted to write and used his childhood in Kansas as a basis for the atmosphere.  Some aspects of the story and atmosphere worked, whereas others did not.<br />The story surrounds a midwest family, the O'Dells, who has recently agreed to allow their niece to live with them while her mother needs to straighten out things in her life.  The niece is afflicted with a disease which has limited her mobility and forces her to use braces when walking.  The youngest son Teddy become enamored with his cousin, but his feelings are in conflict with those toward a friend.<br />The niece reveals to Teddy that she has the power to allow the dead to rise again in ghostly form.  The ghosts inhabit a farmhouse owned by the former Trogler family.  The reason for the ghosts' desire for revenge is nothing revolutionary and the reader can probably guess it before it is revealed.  However, the story is not only about the ghosts that are seen, but also the ghosts of one's past.  The loneliness that wandering spirits exihibit is parallel to that which can accompany a person during their lifetime as well.  Teddy struggles with these feelings of loneliness, his past, his affections toward his cousin.<br />The story starts well, drags in the middle, and ends with a satisfying conclusion.  The theme of loneliness and the longing for the past prevail throughout the entire novel and makes the story &quot;click&quot;.  However, some of the side stories (the feelings of Teddy's friend, the constant interference on the part of Teddy's mom, etc.), which pertinent to the overall story and atmosphere, seemed to be overdone and monotonous at times.  As a result, the story tended to drag in the middle.  Overall, if you enjoy ghost stories with a little human interaction and feelings interspersed, you should enjoy &quot;Haunted Ground&quot;.	2003-02-26
US	49372292	R2J3Y8A83QHDNW	0312983220	931157258	Area 7 (Scarecrow Series)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	More non-stop action from Matthew Reilly	&quot;Area 7&quot; is Matthew Reilly's third novel to be published in the U.S. and his fourth overall novel.  &quot;Contest&quot;, his first published novel has just recently been published in the U.S.  Like his prior novels &quot;Ice Station&quot; and &quot;Temple&quot;, there is little character development, but plenty of non-stop, highly inconceivable action.<br />&quot;Area 7&quot; begins with a trip to a secret underground military/testing facility by the President of the United States.  In addition to a large group of Secret Service agents, Scarecrow Scofield and most of the surviving members of his team from &quot;Ice Station&quot; are along for the ride as well.  Once they arrive, they learn the facility is in the hands of a madman who has planned a world-changing event for a number of years.  What ensues is a race against the clock to prevent the destruction of a number of U.S. cities.  The key to the survival of the U.S. is the survival of the President.  Scarecrow and his team are tasked with ensuring both happen.<br />The novel hits the ground running and doesn't let up.  The elements of Reilly's previous books are here -- commandos, deadly animals, madmen, etc.  Although very similar in structure to his other works, if you enjoyed either &quot;Ice Station&quot; or &quot;Temple&quot;, you will enjoy this one as well.  The reason behind keeping the President alive is a bit farfetched in addition to a number of the action scenes in which the heroes avoid being killed, but overall if you can overlook the unreality of such events, &quot;Area 7&quot; will prove to be an entertaining read.	2003-02-25
US	49372292	R3JDTE9V15HR58	0812524004	418786327	Ultimatum	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Excellent military thriller	\\"Ultimatum\\" was R.J. Pineiro's second published techno-thriller.  Unlike his more recent novels that deal with the computer/high tech industry, this novel is a military thriller that takes place soon after Desert Storm.  Saddam Hussein has nuclear missiles and is readying them for deployment against neighboring countries and U.S. troops stationed in the area.<br />The central figure, Lt. Kevin Dalton, is a fighter pilot in-training who nearly is stripped of his ability to fly due to the direct disobedience of orders.  However, the CG makes an exception and gives Dalton another chance.  Dalton doesn't make the best of his second chance and is soon on the run from the Iraqis.  He meets a Mossad agent named Khalela and soon they join forces to locate where Hussein is producing his weapons.  What ensues is a non-stop, action-filled search that concludes with a resounding climax.  The door is left open for a sequel and Pineiro took advantage of that with his next novel entitled \\"Retribution\\".<br />While a departure from the them of his later novels, \\"Ultimatum\\" is a highly entertaining read and most of the statements regarding military weaponry, planes, etc. seem fairly accurate.  If you enjoy military thrillers with little fluff, I recommend giving \\"Ultimatum\\" a read.  If you find this one enjoyable, read the sequel although it's more of a spy thriller than military thriller.	2003-02-25
US	49372292	R1BMBA66HO7NHD	0812564561	45565499	The Walls of Jericho (Ben and Danielle)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A new era of Land thrillers	&quot;The Walls of Jericho&quot; marks a departure from the typical Jon Land thriller.  While many of his earlier works were non-stop action, this one is lighter on the action and more on the development of the overall story and character development.  One reason for the added character development was due to the introduction of two major new characters -- Ben Kamal and Danielle Barnea.  These two are the central figures in all but one of Land's last seven novels.<br />This one centers around Ben and Danielle's search for a serial killer who has committed a number of murders in the city of Jericho.  Their job is to discover the identity of the killer who calls himself the Wolf and capture him before the killings continue.  The tracking of the serial killer is reminiscent of Ben's tracking of another serial killer named the Sandman, who in the past had killed his family.  Danielle's motivation is to better herself and prove herself to her ailing father.<br />While tracking the Wolf, Ben and Danielle learn that there's more to the situation than the serial killer.  Both Ben's and Danielle's superiors want the Wolf captured to avoid worsening the already tense political situation between their two peoples -- the Israelis and the Palenstinians.  As they get deeper into the investigation, they discover a third party is involved which only complicates matters.<br />&quot;The Walls of Jericho&quot;, while still a good read, is not up the standards set by the better of the Blaine McCracken novels (&quot;The Omicron Legion&quot;, &quot;The Fires of Midnight&quot;, etc.).  The storyline moves slowly at times and some characters are introduced only to be quickly removed from the storyline.  The third party involved, while integral to the overall plot, felt a bit out of place at times.  Overall, it's still a worthy read if you're a fan of Jon Land's works and political thrillers.	2003-02-25
US	49372292	R25WBFIWQOOAUF	0425174204	872231482	Fever	Books	4	35	36	N	N	One of Cook's better novels	\\"Fever\\", one of Robin Cook's earliest novels, is also one of his better ones.  Some were better (\\"Mutation\\"), but it's much better than some of his recent works (\\"Abduction\\" and \\"Vector\\").  Like many of his novels, the premise varies little from novel to novel.<br />This tale centers around a twelve year old girl who has developed a form of leukemia.  Her father, a doctor/scientist who has studied and searched for a cure for cancer for the past nine years following the death of his wife to leukemia, is suddenly having to deal with his nightmares again.  He has since remarried, but soon conflicts arise between the father and his wife, oldest son, and the doctors who prescribe chemotherapy treatment for his daughter.<br />The father soon discovers the cause of his daughter's leukemia.  That source was also the cause of another child's fatal disease.  The father subsequently tries to bring the culprits to justice and continue his work while also trying to find his own cure for his daughter.  The believability factor is strained a bit here.<br />Cook does a masterful job of relaying the tension between the father and his family, but his description and reactions of the girl do seem to fit better with a younger child and not one twelve years of age.  Like many of his novels, there is corporate greed entwined with government agencies.  Even though it's a bit farfetched, Cook makes it work with his skillful writing.  Overall, any fan of Cook or medical thrillers in general should enjoy this one.	2002-10-23
US	49372292	R2A19421BK4NFS	0812568672	72631637	Y2k	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Good, but not Pineiro's best	&quot;Y2K&quot;, while some may think it's outdated due to its title, is still an entertaining read.  Pineiro, the author of numerous techno-thrillers, combines the action of a good Ludlum novel with a high tech background story.  While better than many techno-thrillers, this one is not the best of Pineiro's works.<br />The story opens on a high note with the massacre of a CIA team due to a slip in security procedures.  The lone survivor, a 19 year veteran of the CIA, decides to leave the force and start her life anew.  Little does she know that she can't leave her past totally behind her.  She falls for the CEO of a company that has developed a software application designed to fix parts of the dreaded Y2K problem.  However, there are others who want the code -- some want it for the good of the world and others want it in order to hold the world hostage.<br />While the book does start well and develops well, the chase to retrieve the Y2K code becomes a bit tedious and, at some points, a bit hokey.  With all techno-thrillers, the reader needs to suspend rational thought a bit, but this one seemed too farfetched in places.  The tie-ins with the enemy and the other party involved in obtaining the code is too unbelievable.  Although the days of Y2K are now behind us, this is still a good read for fans of techno-thrillers.  Just be prepared to stretch your imagination a bit more than with other similar novels.	2002-10-21
US	49372292	R1S5T4AKX7167D	0786011149	36141406	The Trench	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Great thriller, but has its faults	&quot;The Trench&quot;, the sequel to Steve Alten's bestselling &quot;Meg&quot;, is a great thriller and every bit as good as the first novel in the series.  The book starts about four years after the conclusion of the first book with the main characters (Jonas, Terry, Mac, etc.) on board.  While the book has an exciting beginning, the middle of the book (the big chase) tends to drag in parts and keeps the book from being an excellent novel worthy of a five star rating.<br />The book opens with the Megalogon named Angel in captivity and being viewed by the public in a Sea World type atmosphere.  The corporation responsible for maintaining Angel is making money hand over fist; however, Jonas (that name has to be a reference to the story of Jonah and the great whale) thinks that Angel is becoming too agitated and could escape.  Eventually his fears come true when some teens break into a secure area, tease the shark and cause her to break free of her surroundings.<br />At this point, Jonas and friends/enemies begin a long trek to retrieve the shark.  His wife is back at the Marianas Trench where the megalodons were discovered.  There is a secret the trench hides and his wife is caught in the middle.  The chase and unraveling of the mystery could have been condensed.<br />An action-packed ending occurs at the Trench with all parties involved.  The ending is not a surprise, but is still well-written and entertaining.  Of course, the book is left open for another sequel which will be released in 2003 entitled &quot;Primal Waters&quot;.  This will supposedly be the end of the planned trilogy.	2002-10-21
US	49372292	R2RDZQWUN38HA3	0812543890	148267955	Exposure	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Excellent techno-thriller	R.J. Pineiro is the author of numerous excellent technothrillers.  \\"Exposure\\" is a non-stop action-packed novel that hits the ground running from the beginning.  Being an engineer at Advanced Micro Designs (AMD), his books tend to have a computer-related theme to them.<br />The story opens with the malfunction of a nuclear power plant in Palo Verde, Arizona.  The malfunction leads to a meltdown that ultimately causes the deaths of all 45,000 inhabitants of Palo Verde.  The cause of the malfunction was an error in the instruction set of the processor in the plant's computers.  Obviously, the idea for this novel resulted from the error on the first generation Pentium chips from Intel in 1994.<br />Two LSU professors discover an algorithm that can duplicate the error on a somewhat frequent basis.  They plan to expose the chip maker for it's faulty processor, but one of the professors is murdered before he can release his findings.  The other professor soon finds herself on the run from an evil syndicate that includes Microtel Corporation, the maker of the processor, the DIA and the local Louisiana police.<br />Eventually, she finds support in an unlikely place in addition to the FBI.  The race is on to retrieve the algorithm to expose Microtel.  However, the syndicate is also out to retrive the last remaining copy of the algorithm.  The book continues on a rapid pace throughout the entire 300+ pages.<br />My only knock on the book is the author's obsession with the female professor's \\"chocolate freckle\\" on her upper lip.  He constantly makes reference to this in every way possible -- wet, being kissed, makeup on it, etc.  A few mentions is fine, but 30+ times in the novel is gross overuse.	2002-10-11
US	49372292	R1MFLNU4OJHX9I	0812544404	882773191	Eden's Gate (Bill Lane)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	An average espionage thriller	&quot;Eden's Gate&quot;, David Hagberg's newest novel featuring his recurring character Bill Lane, is an average read and definitely not up to the standards set by some of his earlier novels.  It is a quick read, but there are a number of problems.  The main problem is the abrupt ending.  It seemed like momentum was being built for a big finale, but it ended up being a one-sided shootout.<br />The novel centers around a German madman, Helmut Speyer, who has discovered a mysterious box located in a submerged area/bunker called Reichsamt Seventeen.  Bill Lane goes undercover as a South African agent named John Browne (with an &quot;e&quot; as reiterated way too many times in the novel).  In order to join forces with Speyer, he saves him from assassination.  While he seems to have Speyer's trust, Speyer's number one man Baumann has his doubts.<br />The action starts when Lane tries to retrieve the mysterious box.  Russian agents become involved and not only does Lane have to keep his cover, he must also protect himself and the Germans from the Russians.  Lane survives many close calls, but that's to be expected in this type of novel.<br />Lane's wife seems out of place and doesn't have a big, or seemingly important, role.  The enemies are all cookie-cutter types and don't seem to have their own personalities.  They all seem to be based on a generic pre-Cold War Russian and WW2 German.  These faults in addition to the rushed ending makes this one an average novel.  However, many of Hagberg's/Sean Flannery's novels are better.  Don't judge the quality of this author's works on only one novel.	2002-09-20
US	49372292	R3IF3O2NB38PU7	0449147754	122272446	The Ninth Dominion	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A change of pace from earlier Land novels	\\"The Ninth Dominion\\" is somewhat of a sequel to an earlier novel by Jon Land entitled \\"The Eighth Trumpet\\".  \\"Trumpet\\" is one of the best of Land's novels and is a non-stop action, espionage thriller.  The same can't be said for \\"The Ninth Dominion\\".  Unlike his earlier works, this one is more of a \\"hunt the serial killer\\" novel instead of an espionage thriller.<br />The novel begins with the escape of eighty four inmates from a maximum security installation.  Their leader, Leeds, a man nicknamed \\"The Candy Man\\", is a mastermind who planned his escape before being captured by Jared Kimberlain, the lead character also known as \\"The Ferryman\\".  Leeds plans to essentially reverse society and have those who have been shunned and locked away from society to take control.  Essentially, the \\"inmates would run the asylum\\".<br />New characters are introduced, including a female character who is a member of the new version of the Caretakers, the group to which Kimberlain was a former member.  The female character has a mysterious past that is linked to Kimberlain, although neither knows it.  The giant Winston Peet also returns from his original appearance in \\"The Eighth Trumpet\\", but is underutilized in this one.<br />While Leeds is trying to overtake the world, a serial killer is stalking small towns (or so it appears) and killing all the inhabitants.  Kimberlain also must track down the killer and bring him to justice.  This is where the novel seems to lose its direction.  Had the book concentrated solely on Leeds and his world domination scheme, the novel probably would have been better.  However, the substory of the serial killer, while tied into the main storyline at the end, seemed out of place throughout most of the novel.<br />If you're a fan of Jon Land's novels, you'll want to read this one as well.  If you enjoy serial killer novels, you might want to give this one a shot.  If you are expecting a novels up to the standards set by \\"The Eighth Trumpet\\", you might bedisappointed.  While it was great to see the main characters return, this one seemed to concentrate too much on Kimberlain and not on the minor/smaller role characters such as Winston Peet.	2002-09-17
US	49372292	R1DG9YW2NYQOT8	0786913886	691317033	The Silent Blade (Forgotten Realms:  Paths of Darkness, Book 1)	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Good, but the series might be losing steam	&quot;The Silent Blade&quot;, the first book in fourth series of Drizzt the Dark Elf novels by Bob Salvatore, is essentially a continuation of the overall story that began more than ten years ago with &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;.  All the major characters return for this novel, including Wulfgar after his return from the Abyss.  While the fight scenes are still entertaining, they have started to become a bit repetitive.<br />As another reviewer mentioned, over the course of the previous ten novels, the characters and their mannerisms/characterizations have been fairly static.  With this novel, Salvatore attempted to breathe new life into some of these characters.  Wulfgar journeys on his own to fight his inner demons.  Entreri sees himself for who he truly is and what the driving factor is in his life.  Jarlaxle is also developed more and has become an even more sinister and deadly foe.<br />This book is broken into three main sections: Wulfgar's journey, the Entreri/Jarlaxle teaming, and the travels of the remaining members of the Companions of the Hall.  This was obviously written in such a manner to lead into the following two novels: &quot;Spine of the World&quot; to further Wulfgar's story and &quot;Servant of the Shard&quot; to further the Jarlaxle/Entreri story.<br />While still a good read, it's not up to the standards set in the earlier novels, especially the first two trilogies.  Maybe Salvatore thought his characters were becoming too static and in order to continue the series, changes had to be made.  The first part of the book dealing with the encounter with the giants was classic Salvatore.  However, the middle third of the book tended to drag a bit as the book was split into the three sections.  However, the ending, while predictable, was action-packed and entertaining, even though the fight scene was essentially a rehashing of prior encounters.	2002-09-05

This one is in the same vein as the books of Matt Reilly (\\"Ice Station\\", \\"Temple\\") and those of James Rollins (\\"Excavation\\", \\"Subterranean\\"), but the depth of the story and its presentation are much better in \\"Domain\\".  This book hits the ground running and never lets up.  The book can be read as a standalone novel, even though it is the first part of a proposed trilogy.<br />\\"Domain\\" centers around the mysterious date specified on the Mayan calendar as the day the world is to end -- December 21, 2012.  The son of an adventurer who devoted a large part of his life studying the mysteries surrounding the date is one of the central figures in the story.  The other is an intern who has been assigned his case as he has been in confinement for over 10 years.  The son, Mick, soon convinces the intern, Dominique, that his father's studies are relevant and that the end of the world is near.<br />Along the way, a discovery is made in the Gulf of Mexico.  Soon afterward, a number of drones are found throughout the world which portend the end is near.  Various areas are soon destroyed which leads warring countries to point fingers at one another.  Not only is the world at risk due to the prophesied day of reckoning, but the superpowers are at war with each other.  The fate of the world rests in the hands of the two who have learned and understand the truth.<br />Overall, fans of techno-thriller and/or science fiction will really enjoy this novel.  There are some ideas that are farfetched (the thirty mile wide dish to be built on the dark side of the moon, as mentioned by another reviewer), but most of them are realistic or could be with just a bit of imagination.  The only parts of the book which I did not enjoy completely were the \\"journal\\" entries by Mick's father.  They sometimes seemed out of place and not relevant to the story.  Other than that, this vision ofthe future is an exciting tale that should not be missed.	2002-08-27
US	49372292	R2EKQEIYMR8RBV	0449146340	638034818	The Valhalla Testament	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Another good one by Jon Land	\\"The Valhalla Testament\\", the 10th printed novel by Jon Land, continues his tradition of non-fluff, action-packed espionage novels.  This one is similar in nature to his others (madman wants to control the world, unlikely hero rises to the occasion, a double-agent appears to stop the hero, etc.), but it is still a worthwhile read.  It's not Land's best, but still better than many similar novels available.<br />This one involves a suspended NFL player whose sister contacts him on urgent business.  Soon after arriving, the sister and several others are slaughtered.  The player then tries to avenge his sister's death.  Little does he know that her murder was a part of a much bigger plot.<br />He soon meets with a female agent named Chimera whose initial responsibility was to kill him.  However, they soon join forces to try and topple the madman.  The male hero in this story isn't as well-developed nor as inspiring as Land's other male heroes.  The female hero is a perfect blend of brains and brawn and works well.  Overall, the storyline is very good, but not Land's best.  Still, if you are a fan of Land, it's another \\"can't miss\\" novel.	2002-08-27

While Batman is the central character in this one, all but one of the &quot;big 7&quot; play a role in the overall story.  The only one of the big 7 who has a minor appearance/role is Aquaman.<br />The story involves a pyramid that is unearthed when Gotham Dam breaks and exposes the long buried structure.  Soon after, the individual members of the Justice League experience weird occurences (undead rising from their graves, an out of control subway train, a problem with a space shuttle launch, etc.), all of which have one thing in common -- the presence of a blue light.  Eventually the team unites to fight the menace, but are all captured leaving Batman and the Martian Manhunter to save the team and the world.<br />Alan Grant, the writer of numerous comic books, gives a good background to many of the characters.  The origins of Flash, Green Lantern, and Superman are described to help casual reader who may know little about the characters.  Minor characters' origins are also revealed (Oracle, Scarecrow, Commissioner Gordon).  Even longtime readers would find this background to the characters refreshing.  Other heroes are mentioned (Plastic Man, Atom, Zauriel), but have minor roles.  Overall, if you are a fan of the Justice League or any of its &quot;big 7&quot;, you should enjoy this original novel.	2002-08-19
US	49372292	RLWC2W5VREMLV	0449133990	706506150	The Gamma Option	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Average technothriller, but below Land's normal work	&quot;The Gamma Option&quot; is Jon Land's third novel featuring his semi-recurring hero Blaine McCracken.  Like all his other technothrillers, this one involves someone trying to take over the world and only one man, Blaine McCracken, can stop them.  Everything you've come to expect from Land is present here, however, unlike his other works, this one starts slowly and doesn't really accelerate rapidly until about the book's midpoint.<br />In this one, a dictator has learned of a submarine that was sunk during World War II.  The dictator learns of the secret cargo and stops at nothing to get it in order to destroy most of the world's population.  However, Blaine McCracken and his trusty sidekick Johnny Wareagle are joined by a mysterious woman named Evira to prevent the destruction.  Caught in the middle of this is Blaine's newly discovered son who has been kidnapped.  Blaine must try to rescue his son while also preventing the dictator from achieving his goal.<br />While still an entertaining read, this one seemed to develop more slowly than previous Land novels.  Also, there were a large number of typographical errors in the edition I read -- the first paperback printing.  The conclusion is satisfying, but if you've read other Land novels, the surprise twist(s) at the end are probably not very surprising.  Overall, it's still better than many other technothrillers out there, but if you're a first time reader of Jon Land, pick up one of his earlier titles as they are better reads than this one.	2002-08-14
US	49372292	RA90Z25H8T4LN	0449133982	980559366	Eighth Trumpet	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Another excellent technothriller from Jon Land	\\"The Eighth Trumpet\\" is Jon Land's eighth technothriller.  Like his previous novels, they are quick reads with little to no fluff, complete with heroic characters that defy death on numerous occasions.  This one also has the usual double-agent, surprise twist.  However, this is my only knock on the book.  It's obvious who the double agent is well before it is revealed.<br />The story involves a madman who tries to destroy the world by attacking a vulnerable area of Antarctica.  A submarine is commandeered for its valuable cargo for use in the climactic scene in Antarctica.  The hero, Jared Kimberlain, is similar in nature to other heroes created by Jon Land.  He managed to escape death at every turn and joins forces with the usual female ally.  The female ally is not a strong one in this novel at first, but eventually shows her fortitude in the showdown at the end.<br />The most enjoyable character is a giant, and former serial killer, named Peet.  However, due to his lengthy institutionalization, Peet has changed his ways and aids Kimberlain.  His evil double, Quail, is a serial killer who is trying to get out of the shadow of Peet and is determined to carry through his part of the ultimate mission -- the killing of one million people at once.  There is an excellent showdown at the top of the Empire State Building between the two large combatants.  The reader is not given any clues ahead of time as to who, if either, will survive the inevitable confrontation.<br />Overall, this book is one of Land's better novels.  It's much better than \\"The Gamma Option\\", the novel that proceeded this one.  This one is non-stop action from the start that also includes a great scene with lifesize killer robots.  The book may be out of print, but can be purchased through many used book outlets.  If you enjoy technothrillers full of action and intrigue, you'll enjoy this one.	2002-08-14

These books seem to be written for two groups: new readers of fantasy and long-time players who seek a feeling of nostalgia.  This one wasn't a masterpiece by any means, and as fantasy novels go, was just an average story.  However, it was a fun story that gives the reader a sense of playing the game, keeping track of hit points, magic spells used, etc.<br />\\"The Savage Caves\\" revolves around a band of adventurers who are on a quest to stop giant spiders from stealing the livelihood of a small town -- their sheep.  The fighter and mage agree to stop the spiders if a halfling scheduled for execution is freed and allowed to join their party.  Along the way, they meet a young mage who has just left her mentor after years of training.<br />The group eventually follows the spiders to a series of caves.  There they encounter goblins and a large hobgoblin that is running the show.  The adventure is basically a hack 'n slash one as the party battles the spiders and goblins, eventually leading to the non-surprising big battle with the hobgoblin leader.  However, the mystery behind the spiders' actions is also revealed as the story reaches a predictable, but satisfying ending.  Overall, if you enjoy fun fantasy with little plot or character development, \\"The Savage Caves\\", and most likely the following books in the series, would be a satisfying read.	2002-08-07

Henrick, is at best an average story.  The book hits the ground running, but wallows in the middle, and the conclusion seems drawn out.  The big surprise at the end isn't much of a surprise either.<br />The story involves a submarine crew from WW II that is called back to duty for one last hurrah.  Their expertise in operating an older submarine is needed in order to plan a surprise attack on the enemy.  The enemy is the Russians who have developed a laser that can eliminate incoming missiles well before they could cause any destruction.<br />Basically, the laser system is a takeoff on the proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, aka \\"Star Wars\\") by the Reagan administration.  The system is discovered by accident by a woodsman who has spent the majority of his life living in the wilderness.  Once the US learns of the weapon, the retired members are called back to active duty one last time.  They team with Alpha team to combat the enemy force.  The ending is as expected and offers no surprises.  Overall, it's an average novel, but might be more entertaining to fans of submarine thrillers.	2002-08-07

Published early in Little's career, this one is different from the horror novels that have made Little a household name in the realm of horror fiction.  While not a fan of the serial killer novel genre, I found \\"Death Instinct\\" to be very entertaining, but not difficult to determine/guess the identity of the serial killer.<br />The story involves a series of gruesome murders in Phoenix that has police baffled.  They can't seem to find any clues and only begin to realize the truth when being tipped off by someone romantically involved with a member of the force.  A young boy is actually the one who first suspects the killer.  It's difficult to give many details about the book without giving away key elements of the plot and/or clues to the killer.<br />Needless to say, the identity of the killer shouldn't come as a surprise.  It might be a bit farfetched, but the explanation behind the killer's motives is logical.  If you enjoy serial killer novels and can locate this one (it's been out-of-print for many years), grab it and enjoy it.	2002-08-07

In this one, Doherty ties the story of Excalibur into the storyline as yet another of the alien artifacts.  The characters from the previous books all return and continue their objectives from earlier.<br />This storyline seems to have been stretched just to sell some additional books.  While still entertaining, some of the mysteries could have been explained in a condensed form.  The mystery behind the Grail is described and the way in which it helps to achieve immortality is also explained.  Battles ensue in this one, both in the skies and seas.  Pearl Harbor is the scene of one of the clashes.  Easter Island again plays a prominent role.<br />Fortunately, some form of conclusion will be reached with the release of &quot;Area 51: The Truth&quot; in December.  Hopefully, mainly of the dangling sub-stories will be concluded and all mysteries revealed.  However, another series will follow this one.  This sounds too much like &quot;The X-Files&quot; in that a few questions are answered and even when the finale is announced, it really is just a precursor to a future continuation of the storyline.  If you've read the others, this one is a must, if only to learn more about the Grail.  However, don't read this one before the others or certain plot areas will make little to no sense.	2002-08-07
US	49372292	R2J3Q3UW51GLJU	0449131181	653353992	The Alpha Deception	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Another good one from Land	\\"The Alpha Deception\\" is the second novel featuring Jon Land's recurring hero Blaine McCracken.  While still a good read, it was not as entertaining as Land's previous novels, including \\"The Omega Command\\" -- McCracken's first adventure.<br />This one involves the discovery of a rare crystal that has unique powers.  When it falls into the hands of the enemy, a death ray is created which destroys all carbon-based entities.  A small town in Oregon is used as a test basis for the weapon and to show the world what power is harnessed by the weapon.<br />McCracken, a rogue agent who is no longer on the payroll for the U.S. Government, is called into action again.  However, after becoming involved, his reasoning for stopping the weapon becomes personal in addition to saving the world.  He eventually teams with a female Russian agent who is similar in nature to McCracken.<br />Unlike previous Land novels, the ending seems abrupt and should have been fleshed out a bit more.  One of the two factions' efforts basically becomes meaningless.  The mole is revealed, but simply surrenders which seemed to be the easy way out.  Also, one of those that oppose McCracken's efforts seems to disappear at the end.  If the ending had been better presented, this one would have been another five star effort from Jon Land.	2002-07-12

The authors, Dan and Lynda Trent writing under the pseudonym &quot;Abigail McDaniels&quot;, had four novels published under the Zebra line.  This one is on par with the majority of horror novels in the line.<br />The story involves a family moving into a house built at the turn of the century.  A playhouse is located on the property and the little girl in the family instantly falls in love with it.  She finds some older toys in the playhouse, the most prominent one being a doll named Ara.  Ara soon starts talking to the little girl, making the girl cater to her every need and desire.  When the girl starts to resist, Ara takes matters into her own hands and starts to torture the girl and her family.<br />While there are no real shock moments in the novel, an element of the unknown still exists.  What is the history of the doll?  What happened to the previous families that lived in the house?  It's a quick read due to it being a short novel (250 pages) and written on a low reading level.  At times, the writing is very simplistic and becomes annoying.  There is little to no detail regarding the surroundings.  Normally there is just back and forth chattering amongst the characters.  Had the writing level been better and there been some shock value, the book would have garnered a higher rating.	2002-07-08
US	49372292	R1H97MT9ZOXZ75	0449131173	393082813	The Council of Ten	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Not Land's best, but still better than most out there	\\"The Council of Ten\\", Jon Land's sixth novel, is very similar in nature to his other works.  They start at a quick pace and the story never drags.  However, if you have read a number of Land's novels, the big \\"shock\\" at the end of this one can be seen well before it happens.<br />This one tells of Drew Jordan, a guy whose grandmother was recently murdered.  She, in addition to three other grandmothers, hid their secret source of income -- they were cocaine smugglers.  Jordan's grandmother leaves him a note to contact someone upon her death.  Before long, Jordan is caught in the web of lies and deceit that ultimately cost his grandmother her life.<br />Two other characters are also major players in the storyline.  Peter Wayman, the Timberwolf, is enlisted by Jordan to help, but Wayman refuses, stating that part of his life will remain in the past.  Wayman eventually learns of his error and joins forces with Jordan.  Elliana Hirsch, a female agent of the Mossad is also pulled into the fray as she searches for the Council of Ten, the group responsible for the death of her husband.<br />Like his other novels, Land's \\"The Council of Ten\\" will keep a reader enthralled as the storyline, while sometimes extremely unbelievable, occurs with non-stop surprises and action.  There is no fluff in his novels and great reads for anyone who is a fan of espionage fiction.	2002-07-07

Normally this is do to increase the amount of dollars generated by the franchise.  Sometimes the result is not worth the effort -- the Gateways crossover, for example.  The multi-part novels which in the past would be compressed into one novel (Gemworld) is also another recent idea to capitalize on the Star Trek phenomenon.  On the other hand, some of their ideas are worth the effort.  The new Stargazer series written by Michael Jan Friedman, at least early on, seems to be worthwhile.<br />&quot;Gauntlet&quot; is the first book in the new series that continues from the story told in &quot;The Valiant&quot;.  This series tells of the early days of Jean Luc Picard as a captain.  Being the youngest ever at 28, even younger than James T. Kirk, is part of the intrigue surrounding the character.  Basically Picard is thrown into the captain's role before he, and most others, feel he is ready.<br />Picard is asked to capture a rogue pirate named the White Wolf.  The pirate has eluded Starfleet's efforts at capture in the past, so Picard is instructed to succeed where others failed.  However, the Admiral has other plans.  He wants Picard to fail as a captain, so he sends him on an impossible quest, complete with seven new crew members.  Eventually the crew begins to act as a unit and the chase to apprehend the White Wolf begins.<br />Friedman does a good job of introducing the mulitude of new characters.  Some of them are intriguing, whereas others should have been omitted.  One of those eventually doesn't make the cut which is fortunate.  The story, while half is character development, is effective in helping to create a new area in the Star Trek universe.  The ending, as noted before, is a bit quirky in that Picard's decision is not typical Picard.  Then again, these are Picard's early days and the Prime Directive, the &quot;rules&quot; that must be followed by Starfleet, is again shown to have its fallacies.Overall, this is one of the better recent Star Trek novels and a great start to the beginning of a new era in the Star Trek universe.	2002-07-07

Like his other novels, this one hits the ground running, contains little to no fluff, and keeps the reader's attention throughout the book.<br />This one opens with the destruction of a space shuttle by an unknown entity in space.  Ground control is unable to see it or prevent it.  McCracken comes on the scene with an attempted hijacking.  From there, he is recruited without the top U.S. brass knowing of his involvement.<br />Meanwhile, a high profile reporter is given a disk with information related to a big corporation's actions.  Once she decides to pursue this lead, she become embroiled in the big mystery.  Eventually, the reporter's and McCracken's worlds collide and they must team with each other to prevent the U.S. from being plunged into chaos on Christmas Eve.<br />If you like quick reads that are full of adventure, twists and turns, double agents and the like, pick up this novel or any of Jon Land's novels.  While this, and many of his other early novels are out of print, they can still be found through various used book sources.	2002-07-02

The story involves a group of twenty people who wake one morning in a strange locale.  None of them can recall how they got there, nor can they remember any recent events.  They are all given identical packages which state a series of rules for the &quot;Game&quot;.<br />The players start to change the rules of the game when members of the group start to disappear.  Eventually, the game becomes one of survival and the individuals have to decide whom to trust.  A few of them end up being murdered and the rules of the game change on a more frequent basis.<br />Overall, the storyline is average and the suspense is average.  The book is a quick read and the storyline does progress at a good pace.  However, when those behind the game and their motives are revealed, the story starts to degrade.  The ending seems rushed and not too much of a surprise.  There are several subplots which are left hanging involving some of the secondary characters and one primary character which also detracts from the story.  Had the ending been presented better and the other characters' outcomes been explained, the book would have been a better read.	2002-06-27
US	49372292	R2JU525KVF8K8	0812536290	481785214	Burial	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Excellent read, but not his best	&quot;Burial&quot; is the third, and currently final, book in the Manitou series by Graham Masterton.  Masterton's horror fiction began with the publication of &quot;The Manitou&quot; in the mid 70's.  Although it had its faults, that one was a good read as well.  The story continued in &quot;The Revenge of the Manitou&quot; a few years later, but that one was not up to par with the first book.<br />Twenty years after the first book, Masterton wrote &quot;Burial&quot; as a conclusion to the series.  The characters are also older as well to reflect the actual passage of time.  The main character, Harry Erskine, is a practicing card reader/fortune teller who has tried to distance himself from the past.  However, Karen, the woman who &quot;gave birth&quot; to Misquamacus (the Manitou) in the first book, returns and soon they both discover that the Manitou, an Indian witch doctor, has returned and has vowed to return the lands of North America to the way they were when Native Americans were the primary inhabitants.<br />Old friends return (Singing Rock) and new ones are made (Martin, EC Dude, Papago Joe) in the fight against the Manitou.  Karen is overtaken by the Manitou again and it's up to Harry and friends to not only free her, but to stop the destruction of North American cities (Phoenix, Chicago, Las Vegas, small towns in Colorado experience some &quot;changes&quot;).  The buildup to the finale is fast paced and the ending is well executed.  The battle at Little Big Horn played a big role in the past and does so again.<br />While the book does have its faults (characters left hanging with no resolution, more detail could have been given on the pact between the Manitou, the Indian god and the other involved party, etc.), overall it's a very entertaining read.  The first two books should be read before this one to better understand the history of the Manitou and the characters.  The book is very gory in places (the jail scene, for example), but this is what fans ofMasterton have come to expect.  While not his best work (the Night Warriors series is slightly better), it is still better than most of the horror fiction out there.	2002-06-25

As another reviewer stated, Land is like Ludlum without the fluff.  However, Ludlum's better novels also have a much more in-depth plot/storyline.  Land's novels tend to be non-stop action.    \\"Labyrinth\\" is like his other thrillers in that a hero fights against unbelievable odds to save the world.  In this novel, a college professor is enlisted to get to the bottom of the plans of an organization known as The Committee.  A friend of the professor's is killed observing actions on the part of The Committee and due to a past debt, he agrees to avenge his friend's murder.    A town is Columbia is burned to the ground to hide the plans of The Committee.  The hero, Christopher Locke, visits various exotic locales including Lichtenstein, Geneva, and London in his trek to determine the scheme of The Committee.  Friends are killed or turn on him, and enemies try to kill him or become his friends.  Before he knows it, Locke is in too deep to get out and must stop The Committee to not only save his family, but also to prevent the downfall of the world's economies.	2002-06-11

It's long out-of-print, but a definite &quot;must read&quot; if you can locate a copy.  Land's novels are always entertaining, but this one is the best of his that I have read.<br />The story centers around a plot by a thought-to-be-deceased madman to eliminate half the population of the United States.  However, this would not be done by obvious means -- nuclear or biochemical warfare.  Three agents are sought by the U.S. to prevent the madman from implementing his plan.  Friends come and go via various means, all which make the battle that much more difficult.<br />Like all great espionage thrillers, this one grabs the reader from the start and never stops until the book ends.  There are betrayals, multiple gunfights, deaths of key and/or well-liked characters.  The story's rapid pace will keep a reader enthralled long into the night.  Like Land's other works, he presents a well thought and prepared story with all the elements that make a great espionage/technothriller.	2002-06-06

I'd never heard of the author, Perry Lafferty, but decided to give it a chance.  Luckily, my chance paid off as it was a worthwhile read.  It wasn't too deep or technical, but a quick, fun read.<br />The premise of the novel is a commercial airline pilot being asked by the CIA to fly a plane holding a top secret military device in its cargo hold.  However, to disguise these intentions from the Russians, the pilot is asked to hijack his own plane.  The plan doesn't work completed as expected and soon the pilot and his crew are fighting for their lives.  Not everyone is as they initially seem and the ending has a nice twist to it.<br />If you enjoy technothrillers, this one would be worth your time.  It's not up there with the best (Jon Land or Tom Clancy), but it is still entertaining.  It is still available through Amazon, even though it was printed ten years ago.	2002-06-03

Salvatore, the author of many works of fantasy, is best known for his dark elf Drizzt in the Forgotten Realms world.  In those works, he's somewhat constrained to elements of the role-playing gaming world.  The Demon Wars saga, of which \\"The Demon Awakens\\" is the first novel, is a chance for Salvatore to create his own world with no restrictions.<br />The saga begins with a creature known as a dactyl being freed from its longtime prison.  The creature slowly grows in strength and amasses armies of goblins, giants, and a dwarf-like race.  On the flip side, the adventures of three children are explored from around age 10 until they reach young adulthood.  The paths the three take are all different, but they all have the ultimate goal -- to put a stop to the growing evil.  They meet a number of companions along the way including a centaur and a nearly untameable stallion.<br />The days of the heroes as children (first third of the book) are filled with thrilling adventures.  However, as they grow into young adults, the pace tends to bog down.  Some of this is character development, but the author seemed to go a bit overboard in places and some of it seemed unnecessary.  However, the final third of the book is a non-stop hack n' slash battle between the forces of good and evil.  The ending is somewhat surprising, but obviously ended in an ambiguous way to leave the door open for a sequel (of which there are now four).<br />If you enjoy Salvatore's other fantasy works, definitely delve into the world of the Demon Wars saga.  If you're new to fantasy, it would also be a good starting point to introduce oneself to modern fantasy.  Have patience with the middle third of the book and you'll be well-rewarded with action-filled finale.	2002-05-31

It's better than most \\"first\\" novels I've read in the horror genre.  It's entertaining, but does have its faults.<br />The book centers around an old church that until recently had been used as a barn.  A relative of the church's original preacher offers a large sum of money and re-opens the church.  However, this church worships the Second Son of God.  The church is haunted by a bell tower creature and ghosts of those who died on church grounds are seen.  Eventually, the ultimate battle of good versus evil occurs in the great climax of the book.<br />The main problem, although not a major one, with the book is the author's over-description of past events, inhabitants of the area, etc.  While a little description is necessary, at times the author seemed to delve too deep in the history and it did little to enhance the story.  However, overall the book is entertaining, complete with a few eerie moments (the communion scene being one of them) -- a good novel, especially for an author's first foray into the world of fictional horror.	2002-05-31

However, like many from that line, this one was simply awful.<br />The front cover has a quote from Harry Harrison: &quot;Noel Scanlon is Ireland's answer to Stephen King.&quot;  I'm not a big King fan (his early stuff is great, but I don't care for his current works), but Scanlon is nowhere close to being in King's league.  If he were, he'd probably have more than two published novels (&quot;Black Ashes&quot; being the other one).<br />I reserve one star ratings for books I didn't finish.  I gave up on this one about 1/4 of the way through the book.  The writing was painful and the story slow to develop.  The big &quot;gotcha&quot; (burning of a body) at the beginning was weak and then the characters seemed to aimlessly wander.  I doubt I'll ever decide to finish this one.	2002-05-24

The book begins in an intriguing manner, mainly the abduction of a prominent character and the beginnings of a civil war.  The long running civil war is the central theme in this novel.<br />A select few in the war torn empire all try to achieve the title of emperor upon the death of the current, aging emperor.  The one direct descendent is missing and another takes over the role as emperor.  Once the descendent is found alive, another round of the civil war begins.  The result has a lasting effect on the empire.  The background of the nation is overly detailed and not absolutely essential to the central story.  Once the civil war begins, the book accelerates at a rapid pace.<br />After the civil war, a former human named Raesene but now transformed monster named the Gorgon, has his own plans for the empire.  Once the Gorgon starts employing members of the empire to achieve his desires, another war soon ensues.  The Gorgon also causes some internal strife among major players within the empire.<br />The ending, while a bit surprising, is presented well and does leave the door open for a sequel.  The sequel, \\"War\\", was the last of the Birthright books published by TSR.  All of the Birthright books are out of print.  If you are a fan of historical, civil war fantasy and are a patient reader, \\"The Iron Throne\\" would be a worthwhile read.	2002-05-23

If you like daring, unbelievable escapes, both of these novels would be your cup of tea.<br />This one involves a secret station located in Antarctica.  A military unit let by Shane &quot;Scarecrow&quot; Schofield (the reason behind the nickname is explained in the novel), investigates the station and discovers some French scientists and everyday citizens.  Soon after, they learn of a secret beneath the station and the French want it for themselves.  A long, thrilling battle ensues for the remainder of the book.<br />Reilly ties in nature in this novel as he did in &quot;Temple&quot;.  Killer whales and another mysterious species are present in the lower levels and below the station.  Both come into play multiple times throughout the novel and fit perfectly into the overall picture.  This one is similar to &quot;Temple&quot; in other ways, including a similar plot of various organizations in search of an elusive object, but overall is still worth the time to sit back, relax, and enjoy.	2002-05-23
US	49372292	R2KWAK9ZIGIUCF	0843928670	97187748	From Below	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Entertaining horror, but not without its faults	\\"From Below\\", one of three published works by John Tigges under his pseudonym of William Essex, is an entertaining and quick horror read.  This was one of the multitude of horror novels published during the horror boom of the mid 80s to mid 90s.<br />The story involves leeches that have grown to enormous sizes -- over a foot and a half in length each.  Since they can reproduce on their own, they reproduce at a rapid rate.  However, this requires them to find constant sources of food.  They emerge from the sewers through pipes and into houses to find their prey.  A large number of people are killed before anyone has a clue as to what caused the deaths.<br />While an entertaining and quick read, the book does have its share of faults.  These faults are common amongst the novels mass produced/published at the time.  The plot is thin, the characters run around totally clueless and don't seem to want to discover the cause of the deaths, and the ending is short and a big letdown.  More ingenious ways could have been utilized to destroy the leeches, but an obvious way to kill them was used, but not used in a believable manner.  Overall, fans of generic horror (like myself) will enjoy this novel.  If you prefer deeper horror with better story development, you might want to steer clear of this one.	2002-05-16

Karl Largent published by Leisure, is not worth a reader's time.  I reserve one star ratings to books that I cannot finish.  This is one of those as I stopped after 135 pages, about one third of the book.<br />The premise, the sudden death of Iraqi tribes and their livestock due to a mysterious new germ warfare agent, seemed interesting.  The novel began well by setting up and explaining the premise.  However, once the hero is drafted to get to the bottom of the situation, things quickly went downhill.  His ex-wife is trying to rekindle the \\"good old days\\" and when he is whisked away to investigate the deaths, she flips.  Why is this character even present?  Maybe she served a purpose later in the book, but I doubt it.<br />There is not \\"non-stop action\\" as another reviewer mentioned.  There are occasional moments, but not enough to keep the reader entertained.  There were a number of sections (imposter conversing with country leader, for example) which were simply boring.  Maybe I'll finish this novel one day and adjust my rating accordingly, but I doubt it.  Stick with Largent's horror novels as they are better works.	2002-05-16
US	49372292	R36V2LXCVK2IE8	0451204123	161070434	The Association	Books	4	1	1	N	N	More over-the-top, entertaining horror	Bentley Little, an author of several works of horror, has written yet another entertaining read. \\"The Association\\" contains several features that are found in another of his works -- \\"The Store\\". Basically, a large organization grows in power, topples the \\"little man\\", and eventually grows so large that everyone must go with the flow or get trampled.<br />The story involves a couple that purchases a home in a gated community which is monitored and maintained by a homeowners association. Things appear somewhat normal at first, until they start receiving ticky-tack notices about violations that are contained in the Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (handbook of rules). People who oppose the Association start to disappear, the fines increase, pets are poisoned, etc. <br />Like all of Little's novels, there is a big, fast-moving buildup that leads to a quick resolution.  This is the main knock I have on several, but not all, Little novels.  Even with that prevalent feature, Little's novels are still highly entertaining. While this one does go over-the-top a bit with the rules enforced/adopted by the Association, the premise of the large, evil organization is effective. The author supposedly decided to write this novel based on some bad experiences he had with his local homeowners association.	2002-05-14

Before Tom Clancy, there was Jon Land. Although he has not achieved Clancy's popularity, his novels are very entertaining. \\"Vortex\\" is an absolutely engrossing novel that is hard to put down.<br />The story begins with the disappearance of a 727 from radar. A friend of the main character observes this, but no one believes him and he is eventually silenced to cover up the larger plan. After the flight returns, some of the passengers have enhanced capabilities. One of those survivors, a 15 year old boy, becomes a wanted target by those behind the infamous Vortex project. The hero, like all heroes in technothriller, avoids a number of traps to eventually unravel the mystery behind Vortex.<br />The Philadelphia Experiment plays a role in this as well as Albert Einstein. A bit of science fiction is added to the story in this area and, while only proven in theory, it does fit with the overall storyline. A race to prevent World War III begins and ends with the mystery of Vortex. Since this was published in 1984, there's even a mention of Reagan's \\"Star Wars\\"/SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative), although it isn't mentioned by name.<br />The book is long out of print, but definitely a \\"must-read\\" if you can locate a copy and are fans of technothrillers.	2002-05-13

Other reviewers have deemed this a &quot;fun&quot; read and I whole-heartedly agree.  The novel is not deep on character development, but that doesn't seem out of place here.<br />The novel hits the ground running with the massacre of monks at a monastery.  The novel continues at a quick pace for the next 500 pages and never lets up.  There are many twists and turns, surprises, double agents, etc.  By then end, the reader wonders who is the more prominent villain in the grand scheme of things.  Many mysteries abound ranging from creatures inside the temple, the history of the sought idol, why everyone wants the idol, etc.<br />Unfortunately, it's difficult to go into much detail as there are a number of surprises the reader must discover for himself/herself.  If you're a fan of Clive Cussler, James Rollins, or Tom Clancy, this is a &quot;must-read&quot;.  While there is little to no character development, the non-stop (and sometimes very far-fetched) action will keep the reader enthralled for many hours.	2002-05-13

Saberhagen starts off the collection with a \\"What If?\\" story.  Basically, the story of the Swords is rewritten and sets the stage for new stories regarding the Swords if the first story had actually happened.<br />The first five stories are excellent, especially the one by Robert Vardeman that dealt with a man's desire to prove the town \\"hero\\" a fraud.  The story is an emotional one with an ending that is powerful.  It makes the reader wonder whether they should be pleased with the story's resolution or hurt due to characters' actions which are simply innate ones.<br />While the first five stories are excellent, the last three tend to drag.  It seems like the authors were all told they had to create a short story using one or more specific Swords as the anthology encompasses all but one of the Swords.  The one Sword does receive a mention in the first story, but does not serve an integral part like the other eleven do throughout the anthology.  Had the last three stories been as enthralling as the first five, this would be a five star book.  However, due to their letdown, it is a four star book.  Overall, it's definitely a worthwhile read to all fans of the Swords books.	2002-05-06
US	49372292	R5WIZFCKT3BZG	0786915617	958867794	The Magehound (Forgotten Realms: Counselors & Kings, Book 1)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	A good start to a trilogy	&quot;The Magehound&quot; is the first book in the Counselors and Kings trilogy by Elaine Cunningham, the popular author of many books in the Forgotten Realms series.  As evidenced by this book and her others in the Forgetten Realms world, Ms. Cunningham is definitely a fan of elves as a few to several of her characters are of elvish descent.<br />The story revolves around a young jordaini that has his best friend taken from him.  The primary villain, Kiva, the Magehound, is the one responsible and Matteo, the jordaini, seeks justice.  While Matteo himself does not have magical abilities (it is forbidden for jordaini to have them), he does meet others with magical abilities to help him on his quest.  The Magehound convinces those who follow her that her plans for conquering a swamp filled with undead are honorable.  However, they soon learn that she is simply one who intends to better herself.  <br />The storyline drags a bit in places, but that is to set up events later in the book.  The ending is satisfying, but abrupt.  The buildup is too long for the quick resolution.  There are a number of subplots left hanging which will be resolved in the next two books.  The fight scenes are also not discussed in detail like they are in Salvatore's books (his strongpoint).  Cunningham seems to spend more time describing the characters and their world.  This is not necessarily bad, but when a book is this short (312 pages) and too much time is spent in this manner, the overall flow of the book is affected -- hence my rating of three stars.  It's still an enjoyable read, but be prepared to read the other two books in the trilogy soon afterward to have all questions answered.	2002-05-06
US	49372292	R3LUE6MZD433HE	0812564375	666062148	Mount Dragon	Books	3	26	26	N	N	An average novel	Of all the works published by the Preston and Child team, \\"Mount Dragon\\" is my least favorite.  The premise of the novel is very similar to The Andromeda Strain, as mentioned by another reviewer.  The novel would pick up steam at points, then drag for a while, get exciting again, drag again, etc.<br />The story revolves around a top secret facility which is believed to be devloping a secret weapon.  Two scientists discover the truth behind what is being developed and tested at the facility and soon are on the run.  All along, they are aided by persons outside the facility, one of which knows the mastermind personally.  <br />The book starts like most Preston and Child books -- at a rapid pace.  However, until the mystery starts to unravel, the pace becomes too slow.  The book then picks up again when the truth behind Mount Dragon is discovered.  Then, the last third of the book involves the heroes on the run which is too long and drawn out.  The confrontation between the mastermind and his adversary in a virtual world is highly entertaining, even though it does seem to be a bit out of place.<br />Overall, if you like the other works by Preston and Child, you will probably enjoy this one.  If you're a fan of science thrillers and haven't read any of their works, read \\"Riptide\\" or \\"The Ice Limit\\" as they are better works with little to no slow points in the storyline.	2002-04-25

All but two of them have been entertaining reads that have held the reader from the beginning until the end of the book.  \\"The Walking\\" is one of those two.<br />Like all his novels, Little does an excellent job of setting up the story and develops it at a rapid pace.  However, some of his works, including this one, tend to have only a so-so or rushed ending.  This one definitely had a rushed ending.<br />The story revolves around a number of people on a list that have died, but their bodies started and continued to walk after their death.  A small group of relatives to the dead band together to determine why and to where these people are walking.  The story flips from the present to the past a number of times.  The present part of the story is excellent and the past is sometimes lacking.  Eventually, Little merges the two at the ending.  However, this ending did seem to be rushed and not as satifying as it should have been.<br />If you're a Little fan, definitely read this one as it's still a good read.  It's not up to par with his better works (\\"The Store\\", \\"The Summoning\\", \\"The Revelation\\"), but it is better than at least one of his other works (\\"The Town\\").	2002-04-24

However, unlike his other works, &quot;The Ignored&quot; is not a horror novel.  It's more of a sci-fi story that reads like an extended version of a Twilight Zone episode.<br />The story centers around an average guy, Bob Jones, who lives an average life.  After accepting a new job, he begins to realize that his life is average and that no one seems to notice him, regardless of his actions, choice of clothing, etc.  He eventually reaches a breaking point and snaps.<br />At this point, he encounters a stranger who is just like him -- simply average.  Bob is asked if he would like to co-exist with average people like himself.  Bob's decision has him to continue on an emotional rollercoaster.  Bob realizes his life will have to reach the bottom of the mountain before he can start working his way to the top, and to a new start on life.  His inner struggle with what life throws at him is described in great detail and gives the reader a genuine feel for what Bob experiences.	2002-04-15

While his other works (\\"NeverLand\\", \\"Dark of the Eye\\", etc.) are quality novels, \\"The Children's Hour\\" stands hand and shoulders above them.  Unfortunately, it seems to have had the lowest print run of all his titles as the publisher, Dell, was slowly phasing out its horror line when this one was published.<br />The story revolves around the return of a former resident to the town of colony.  When he left fifteen or so years prior, he had fought and conquered an ancient evil.  However, he feels the need to return at his mother's request due to her failing health.  He returns with his family in tow.<br />Soon after he returns to Colony, the evil returns.  Friendships are restored just in time to combat the evil.  Children are affected and soon turn on the adults of the community.  The main character knows that once again he must confront and defeat the evil which resides below a barn in the community if he, his family and friends are to survive.  A thrilling race against time ensues and when completed, the reader is left wanting more.  If you can locate a copy, grab this one and enjoy it.	2002-04-12

The Egyptian characters mentioned in the novel actually existed, with only minor differences in the spelling of some names.  The lineage described was also pretty much true to form.<br />The novel revolves around a middle-aged woman who has been haunted by visions all her life.  The visions are of an Egyptian queen who died over 3,000 year ago.  The spectre asks her to help her to uncover the mystery of the deaths of her family and reveal the truth to the world.  Then, the spirits of the dead that are caught in pergatory can finally achieve peace.<br />The novel is well-written and rarely drags for more than a few pages.  The beginning is a bit slow, but once things get started (the appearance of the evil ghosts), it continues non-stop through the entirety of the novel.  The ending is a bit of a letdown... however, the book does imply that it was completed.  Overall, it's a good horror novel that will keep readers of horror fiction entertained.	2002-04-06

Normally known for editing collections of horror stories from other authors, this book is a collection of short stories written by Mr. Etchison between 1980 and 2000.<br />Overall, the book is average horror with most of it being psychological horror. While psychological horror is not particularly a favorite of mine, there were a few excellent stories. \\"When They Gave Us Memory\\" is very reminiscent of and in the same vein as a Twilight Zone episode. \\"Call Home\\" and \\"The Dead Cop\\" are also entertaining stories.<br />However, there are a few stories which have little substance and does more to confuse the reader than make them think. \\"Deadtime Story\\" tended to linger for too long and the conclusion was not satisfying. \\"The Scar\\" didn't drag as it was short, but the ending was confusing. Overall, the book is worth a read, but be prepared to take the good with the bad.<br />Regarding thekid9's comments:<br />I don't know what facts I need to check.  I never said that Etchison wasn't an established author or that he hasn't been writing for a number of years (I mentioned that Death Artist was a collection of some of his works from the past 20 years).  I agree that he got his start by writing short stories.  However, several of his recent (last 15 years) published works were ones where he served as the editor.  He has written a few novels, most of which seemed to be short stories that were stretched into a book-length story.  No matter how big a fan of Etchison you are, the Death Artist was not an excellent (five star) short story collection as evidenced my other reviews in addition to mine.  Maybe the other collections mentioned by thekid9 were five star books (I haven't read them), but this one definitely was not.	2002-04-03

This is not really a sequel, but a continuation of the overall story.  The author has begun to deviate somewhat from the central storyline, but he makes it work.<br />This one involves the supposition that the Ark of the Covenant lies beneath the Sphinx.  Lisa Duncan's quest is to determine whether or not it really resides there.  The usual &quot;aliens tracking humans trying to keep them from learning the truth&quot; occurs here and the storyline builds to a big conclusion.<br />The book is not a 5-star book due to its dragging in parts and the author trying to tie too many things together.  Some of them work and some don't.  Things become more unrealistic in the following book -- &quot;The Grail&quot;.  Read this one if you found the earlier books readable, but don't start with this one.  Otherwise, some of the subplots will make little to no sense.	2002-03-26

While better than the other earlier books, the author seems to be trying to incorporate too many elements and artifacts into the overall storyline.<br />This one, like all the others, picks up where the previous novel ended.  Lisa Duncan has discovered the Ark of the Covenant, but the aliens have found her.  She also finds something else within the Ark that the aliens want.  Other sub-storylines exist, but none which really do much to advance the overall story, hence the 3-star rating.  Mike Turcotte is on the run as usual, the Easter Island saga doesn't advance, etc.<br />If you want to read some truly &quot;out there&quot; fiction, the Area 51 series will fill that desire.  However, the author has now tried to incorporate too much into the series.  If you ever wondered about the connections between Easter Island, the Ark of the Covenant, Atlantis, Jesus Christ, the Grail, the pyramids and Sphinx, vampires, Noah's Ark, Mount Sinai, Excalibur, etc., you'll get a kick out of how the author tries to tie everything together.  Some of the connections worked early in the series, but now some of the connections seem too disjointed.  The series is supposed to be finished by book 7 (after Exclalibur).  Hopefully the author will tie everything together by then in a semi-logical, quasi-fictional way.  Then again, he may not as there's the rumored sequel series to Area 51 next year...	2002-03-26

Diane Carey, the author of several Star Trek novels (both novelizations and originals), offers her opinion on what characters are thinking and feeling, whereas the episode offers no hint of this. Maybe her opinion is right, maybe not, but it works.<br />The story opens with Sisko bringing a new warship to DS9 in hopes that it will help the Federation in their eventual battle with the Dominion. When they take it for a trial run after exiting the other side of the wormhole, they get a chance to test its firepower. Eventually the crew is split into three groups.<br />Odo's portion is the most intriguing as he learns a little about his past/origin. The ultimate resolution to this revelation is a bit weak, but the build-up is entertaining. There are a few minor surprises with the ending, but nothing earth-shattering. Overall the novelization warrants a four star rating, whereas the episode itself is only average and would warrant a three star rating.	2002-03-13

Margaret Weis, one of the authors of the original DragonLance Chronicles and Legends trilogies is at her best when she writes about her favorite character -- the mage Raistlin.  All the elements that made the original trilogies is recaptured here and definitely brings back memories of those two excellent trilogies published fifteen years ago.<br />The Soulforge begins with Raistlin at age six and progresses until his taking of The Test at age twenty-one.  A number of the Heroes of the Lance also make appearances and meet each other for the first time.  This is the only problem with the novel.  The purpose of the Meetings Sextet written about ten years ago was to introduce readers to the Heroes of the Lance before their adventures in Chronicles.  However, the utilization of the characters and their meetings with/introduction to one another in this novel differs at times from the stories originally presented in the Meetings Sextet.  Other than that, this is an outstanding work which warrants a five star rating.<br />We get to see Raistlin progress from a child who was always picked on by others to his being the youngest mage to take The Test.  We also learn the origin of Raistlin's magic at an early age, his golden skin tone, the reasoning behind his harsh/untrusting attitude toward others, the cause of his frailty, etc.  Overall, if you're a Raistlin and/or DragonLance fan, The Soulforge is a must-read.	2002-03-13

The story is top notch, well-crafted, and well-delivered.  When TOR was publishing horror novels on a monthly basis, you could always look forward to a new Masterton title at least once a year.<br />The story centers around an fan obsessed with a child star who was murdered fifty years in the past, at the age of eight.  The fan was so devoted to keeping the memory of the child star alive that he writes a musical based on the child's life.  However, Hollywood has no takers for filming it.<br />The fan later discovers that some of items belonging to the child are available for sale.  He purchases a mirror, later discovering that the child is still \\"alive\\" in the mirror.  Later, when things take a turn for the worse, the fan discovers the truth behind the child's presence in the mirror.  Then the real terror begins...<br />If you can find a copy of this one, it would be well worth your time to read.  If you can't, pick up one of Masterton's recent novels published by Dorchester Publications under the Leisure horror line.	2002-03-10

This book begins with the heroes from the first book in peril and the pace continues throughout the book.  Unlike the first two, there are no lull periods.<br />While the first two were mainly action-oriented, there was little heart-to-heart involvement between the characters.  In this one, the main hero, Sunbright, searches for his lost tribe.  Even though he was forced from his tribe in the past, he feels it's his destiny to find his tribe and return them to their prior glory.  Not only does he find resistance within the tribe, but he and his companion encounter a number of obstacles outside the tribe.<br />A character from the first book returns, but in a new, more powerful form.  After resolving the issues with his tribe, Sunbright has the ultimate showdown with the enemy.  While the ending is rather abrupt, it is satisfying.  The revelation about his companion is a little &quot;out there&quot;, but most readers will probably see it coming.  Overall the trilogy is better than average with an excellent conclusion.	2002-03-04

Two of the main charcters from the first book return and the story begins soon after the concluding events of the first book.

His newfound ally from the first book, the sorceror Candlemas, also returns and aids Sunbright.  After the initial discovery of a shooting star, the heroes are transferred to a different time.  The book begins to drag when the heroes are separated.<br />New allies are found, there are plenty of sword fights, and the story starts to pick up again at the beginning of the final third of the book.  There's a big buildup to the finale which is well-written (involves a character trying to achieve god status), but it is a bit short.  The book is still recommended as long as you read the first book beforehand.	2002-03-02

The book immediately jumps into the action and continues almost non-stop throughout the book.  There is an extended lull about a third of the way through the book which lasted a bit too long -- hence my rating of four stars instead of five.<br />After the lull ends, the action starts again with the meeting with the One King and his task to Sunbright, the barbarian main character.  The basis for the story is two wizards placing a bet on the barbarian's survival.  Eventually, the bet comes back to haunt them and they, in addition to Sunbright and his newfound companion Greenwillow, must try to right the wrongs caused by the bet.<br />Creatures abound in this one -- dragons, pit fiends, hordes of Nine Hells creatures, etc.  It's a fun read, but don't look for much character development.  Although the trilogy is now out-of-print, copies can still be found ...	2002-02-27
US	49372292	R3VV9Y5LVSQF95	0786012595	970499077	Nightlife	Books	5	3	3	N	N	One of the best vampire novels	Nightlife is by far one of the best vampire novels written in recent years.  Jack Ellis, a pseudonym for Stephen R. George, chose to save his best work for last.  This was the last title he had published under the Zebra/Pinnacle horror line.<br />The vampire, while holding true to many of the features of vampires from previous works and movies, does have a few new wrinkles.  For one, this isn't a vampire that sucks its victims dry of blood.  I won't spoil the means by which it captures and kills its prey because it's something you'd never expect from a traditional vampire.<br />The vampire, Richard Carnitch, is more than 200 years old and preys on the types of people who wouldn't normally be missed by society in general -- transients, prostitutes, etc.  This keeps him flying \\"under the radar\\" and helps him to sustain his life by feeding at will with no repercussions since no one would notice the victims missing.  That is, until the main character, Simon, sees a friend of his killed by the vampire.  From there, Simon forms a party to hunt and destroy the vampire.<br />The book is a fun and easy read and a good way to spend an afternoon.  Of the books by George/Ellis I've read, this is his best.  It's been reprinted a few times and is still available.  If you can find it, grab it, read it, and enjoy sinking your teeth into it.	2002-02-23
US	49372292	R23LWMI772HNYH	0440220726	525022420	The Rock	Books	5	56	58	N	N	An exciting science thriller	The back of the book labels &quot;The Rock&quot; as a science thriller.  This is an accurate description as it's a combination of science fiction and techno-thriller.  While similar to his other books (Area 51, Atlantis, etc. -- published under a pseudonym), this one grabs you at the beginning and doesn't let go.<br />Five people from across the planet are summoned to a secretive meeting with no idea of what is to happen.  They soon learn that a transmission has been received with their names included.  Other scientists, the military, the Russians and the President eventually get involved.  What results is a race against time to preserve the future of the human race.  The resolution is well presented and has a definite sci-fi feel to it.<br />If you enjoy the other novels by this author, you will definitely enjoy this one as well.  It's a quick and easy read that can be completed in one sitting.  If you find this work entertaining, check out the novels by James Rollins for other &quot;science thriller&quot; works.	2002-02-21
US	49372292	R2L33PRPRXUSOG	0380818809	87950657	Deep Fathom	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Another excellent novel by Mr. Rollins	While similar in nature to his two previous novels (Subterranean and Excavation), Deep Fathom is still an easy and entertaining read. While all his novels require the reader to suspend some belief, he does provide ample reasoning to support the events occurring. I won't go into details to avoid spoiling any of the plot for future readers.<br />All his books have a little Cussler (adventure), Ludlum (espionage) and James Bond (hero avoids being killed). Of his three books published in paperback, this one is the best of the three. All grip the reader from the start (eclipse, earthquakes, etc. in this one) and don't let go until the end. The major knock on this one, and a reason I gave it four stars instead of five, was the somewhat \\"hokey\\" resolution at the end/prologue. Aside from that, this is a excellent novel to fill some hours of reading time.	2002-02-19
US	49372292	RMHUNW26I2FVJ	0441667627	423356785	Plague	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Excellent thriller from a master of horror	Graham Masterton, while most known for his horror novels (The Manitou, The Djinn, The Sphinx, etc.), wrote a number of thrillers early in his career.  Plague is one of those and it is also one of his best works.  While the overall premise *may* be a bit farfetched, it is still a highly entertaining read.<br />The novel centers around a plague started from contaminated waste located off beaches in Miami.  The plague starts slowly, only infecting a few, but eventually explodes throughout the city, eventually across state lines and further.  The novel has two parts -- the infection followed by the survivors trying to stay alive while trying to find a cure.  The ending is somewhat unique and leaves something to the imagination of the reader.<br />The book is currently out-of-print, but can probably be found in used book stores or from various websites that sell used books.  If you can locate a copy, grab it, read it, and enjoy.	2002-02-19
US	49372292	R3AZX8AVUV0QG2	0821718444	864537963	Moondeath	Books	3	3	3	N	N	An above average werewolf novel	Moondeath, Rick Hautala's first published horror novel, centers around a small town that is slowing seeing its population decreasing.  The main character guesses the origin of the creature, but is unable to convince the longtime citizens.  The town always reports the deaths to the media in a way that makes no mention of animal attacks.  The conclusion is a little weak, especially after the long buildup.<br />Although predictable, the novel is still entertaining.  Hautala's style is very smooth and the novel is an easy read.  This is not his best work, nor the one for which he is best known.  If you can locate a copy, read &quot;Little Brothers&quot;.  Others which I highly recommend are &quot;Night Stone&quot; and &quot;Moon Walker&quot;.  While long out-of-print, it's worth the effort to try to locate a copy of each.	2002-02-15
US	49372292	RWXMYVVR7BDM5	084393204X	38828767	The School	Books	3	7	7	N	N	An average horror novel	The School is a novel published during the &quot;heyday&quot; of horror novels from the mid 80s - mid 90s.  At the time, many publishers were publishing one or two horror novels a month.  Some were excellent, some were simply awful, and many were just average.  This one is one of those average titles.<br />The story centers around an all-girl boarding school which has a mysterious past.  Fifty years earlier, a student disturbingly killed the headmaster and two students in a gruesome fashion.  This event set the stage for the school in its modern day.  A girl is sent to the school after her parents divorce.  Not long after arriving, she sees visions of things that happened fifty years ago.  Eventually she ties the past events with the present.<br />While slow in parts, there are some eerie scenes which will please horror fans.  The authors, Ed Kelleher and Harriette Vidal, penned a number of horror novels published under the Leisure line.  This one is indicative of their works -- nothing outstanding, but still an average story.	2002-02-15
US	49372292	R11A3M54HSAJ21	0786013796	307454234	Dark Magic	Books	2	1	2	N	N	The magic isn't there	Throughout the past fifteen years, Stephen Gresham has written a number of entertaining horror novels with above average plots.  This, however, isn't one of them.  Every author seems to have a novel which doesn't live up to the expectations set by their previous works.  Hopefully, this is the case with only this novel and future Gresham horror novels will be more along the lines of his previous novels.<br />As evidenced by the title, this one involves witches and the magic which accompanies their lives.  Some have the magic, others have lost the magic, and an evil force uses dark magic against them.  However, the plot was fairly weak -- a girl is lost in the swamp, her mother and aunts try to find her, they encounter an evil force, etc.  The atmosphere is not eerie and the resolution occurs too quickly after a long, and sometimes tedious, build-up.<br />It was a welcome relief to finally see a non-vampire novel published under the \\"resurrected\\" line of horror novels from Pinnacle/Kensington books.  It would be great if some of the more well-known, and often published, Zebra/Pinnacle horror authors from the mid-80s through mid-90s heyday were to have new works published.  Most of William W. Johnstone's and Ruby Jean Jensen's novels were above average to excellent, but alas, neither seems to be writing horror novels currently.	2002-02-01
US	49372292	RM54SU3XTMESY	0786013788	133361536	In The Blood (Pinnacle horror)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Vampiric horror -- Southern style	Stephen Gresham, author of several horror titles under the Zebra print line of the mid 80's to mid 90's, has written his first novel published under the Pinnacle horror line (although both Zebra and Pinnacle are lines published by Kensington Books).<br />Much like his earlier works, &quot;In the Blood&quot; is a quick read and contains many elements to keep the reader enthralled.  This vampire story has a distinctive Southern flavor to it, but this is due to it taking place in Alabama, where all of Gresham's novels occur.  <br />The premise of the novel surrounds a family that is bound together &quot;by blood&quot; and their family is always their main priority.  An evil is unleashed when an old plantation house is to be demolished.  One member of the family becomes a member of the living dead and before long, several other family members become vampires as the family is again bound &quot;by blood&quot;.<br />While the author tries to convey the way in which people in small Southern towns tend to speak, it's sometimes difficult to express this dialect in words.  However, the effort does tend to give the reader an idea of what small town life in the South is like.  For the most part, the characters are believable and the story, while it does have a few slow moments, is entertaining.  The ending was a bit unexpected and unusual for a horror novel, but after reading most of Gresham's novels, you learn to expect the unexpected.<br />Whle not Gresham's best work, it is still a good read.  If you can locate a copy, read some of his earlier novels including &quot;Moon Lake&quot; and &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, both published under the Zebra horror line.	2001-06-12
US	49372292	RGFOTXPGKE46W	0446607177	11618814	Riptide	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An excellent thriller	Once again, Preston and Child have written a novel which will keep the reader enthralled for several hours.  The authors keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat from the beginning of the book until the end.<br />The  authors evidently do quite a bit of research for their novels.  Their  description of the Water Pit and its various pitfalls is incredible.  The  only downside to the novel is its big buildup to the discovery of what lies  in the Pit and what happens when the discovery is made.  Due to the immense  buildup, the eventual discovery is a slight disappointment.  Some readers  will probably decipher the mystery before it's revealed.<br />Other than that,  this novel is a very entertaining and fun read.  The authors of &quot;The  Relic&quot; have written another outstanding novel.	2000-06-13
US	49372292	R2TMQATKIHSREG	0786904771	423072858	Escape From Undermountain: Forgotten Realms (The Nobles, No. 3)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	An excellent addition to the Forgotten Realms saga	Mark Anthony has written an exciting chapter in the Forgotten Realms saga.  The story of a thief who agrees to find a lost noble in the multi-level dungeon/labyrinth is one full of magic, monsters and mayhem.  Once the  character thinks he's found a way out of Undermountain, he's faced with a  new set of obstacles.<br />This one will keep diehard readers of fantasy  novels and new readers of fantasy novels entertained for hours.  Of all the  novels in the The Nobels series, this one is the best.<br />Also recommended  is &quot;Crypt of the Shadowking&quot;, a novel in The Harpers series, by  the same author.	2000-06-13
US	49372292	RZXY5A333O6K9	0843936762	596910644	Prank Night (Leisure Horror)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Another entertaining horror novel by Mr. Robbins	If you've read and enjoyed any of David Robbins' other horror novels, you will enjoy this one as well.  While not quite as entertaining as his novel &quot;The Wereling&quot;, this one is still worth a few hours of reading  time.<br />The story takes place in your typical small, backwoods town.  An  unknown creature, initially believed to be a bear, goes on a killing spree.   As the townspeople are picked off one by one, the true nature and origin  of the creature are slowly learned by the survivors.<br />A few subplots  occur, one of which is the typical &quot;long lost high school sweethearts  find each other and start their lives anew&quot;.  Most of them, including  this one, do nothing to advance the story.  It would have been better if  the author would have excluded it from the story.<br />Overall, if you like  B-grade type horror stories which are reminiscent of Saturday afternoon  Creature Theatre, you will enjoy this novel.	2000-06-13
