Shields.)<br /><br />\\"The Aubobiography is mainly Mill's account of his unusual intellectual training and achievements, and of his career as a writer and thinker.  In this brief introduction there would be no point in relating what Mill tells in his own words.  But some features of his life and character which are not fully treated in the Autobiography are of sufficient import to deserver our special attention.<br /><br />On Mill's own testimony, as well as that of his friends and chroniclers, the  most imprtant fact about Mill's life was his strong and lasting - and unconventional - attachment to Harriet Taylor.  Thus Mill's life falls into three periods: before, during , and after his intimate association with Mrs. Taylor.<br /><br />Before he met Harriet, John Stuart Mill was a brillant leader of a talented circle of younger Benthamites known as the \\"Philosopical Radicals\\". The group, intentionally patterned after the eighteeneth-century French school of Philosophes, was devoted to promoting Utilitarianism.  Almost from the day of John's birth - May 20, 1806 - both his gifted father and his famous patron, Jeremy Bentham, had groome the young Mill to inherit the mantle fo the Benthamite movement....\\"	2005-08-28

They make a very convincing case, citing an array of fanatic agendas, known and undiscovered, and an established black market in weapons grade material originating from the former Soviet Union.<br /><br />Indeed, since the horrific events of 9-11, potential victims everywhere have been given little assurance that existing counterterrorist strategies will work against a global threat upon civilian targets.  Fortunately, however, in a free society, the people are not obligated to surrender to such an uncertain fate.  Privileged by the supremem law of their land, they can fashion creative tactics of thier own in the War on Terrorism.<br /><br />The founding fathers who enacted this law could not have envisioned the kind of guerrilla assaults confronting our several states today.  But in their ageless wisdom, they may have conveyed a message across time which could reverse the inevitable through patriotic reinvigoration.  The Constitution they drafted so long ago makes provision for the very kind of threat facing America today.  And like the elusive enemy, it is found where one would least expect it, in the seemingly archaic references to the United States militia.<br /><br />This is a story about the powers reserved to the people.  The War on Terrorism has long been declared, and the domestic battle fields can be found in neighborhoods all across America.  In a two part novel, Constitutional Rights Attorney Leon Kozol addresses two principal fronts.  Book One takes the reader on an outdoor adventure across lakes, rivers and cities of the Northeast and lower Canada where a domestic terrorist consipacy is unfolding.  Building on these events, Book Two diverts to the indoor battles in courtrooms, workplaces and homes of an upstate New York community.<br /><br />Along the way, timely subplots emerge surrounding the ecology and political ramifications of Indian land claims and casinos. A unique blend of entertainment and education, it is a novel sure to captivate a growing segment of an impacted population.r />Along the way, timely subplots emerge surrounding the ecology and political ramifications of Indian land claims and casinos.

I feel a rush go through my body.  I feel the stillness.  My left foot touches earth.  I start to take a running stride.

His account of hope and survival carries a special message for those who fought there or were wounded there, and for those who stayed home, especially the women who love their men and have tried to understand what they endured and how it changed them.<br /><br />For the author, Vietnam meant five months of combat and a year in Ward Three South at Great Lakes Naval Hospital.  When he left the hospital, he was twenty - the oldest man on the ward.  Vietnam was, more than any other conflict, a teenager's war, and Rick's account is one of teenage love and despair, as are those of his buddies.  How these young men were joined together in a special fraternity for which the only initiation dues were pain, and how they managed to cope, makes M*A*S*H take a back seat to real life.\\"<br /><br />Especially relevant today as thousands of vets wounded in Iraq and  Afghanistan make their way home.	2005-07-02

One of the discoveries he made in the course of this convinced him that the language of the common man - often called dialect - with its preference for the concrete expression, is a worthy model even for his better-read compatriots.  Another is his feeling that the historian, at the end of the twentieth century, needs to widen his catchment area to include the material revealed by anthroplogists all over the world, in order to make a closer bond between the disciplines.

Night after night audiences all across America are treated to the spectacle of young Christian kids putting their faith and religious experiences on the line in front of that glaring \\"Naked Spotlight\\".  Admit it or not, that's a daring venture.  After all, this isn't like sitting in Sunday School class surrounded by friends talking about how wonderful it is to be a Christian...and how everyone in the world should share this experience.<br /><br />Standing on that stage in front of hundreds, maybe thousands, of nameless faces while being blinded by the spotlight is not a place for the weak in spirit.  Taking a stand in that environment means \\"Telling It Like It Is,\\" and baring oneself to all those who question or even express disdain for that philsophy.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many times I've been a member of those audiences and have been thrilled, chilled, and even moved to tears by these young people who sing their hearts out time after time in an effort  to share their Christ.  That youthful zest and energy is invigorating, while the open conviction is convincing and infectious.<br /><br />Having those thoughts in the back of my mind as I read through \\"What Do You Say To A Naked Spotlight\\", I was impressed with the idea that this book is not just the book of the year but the book of an era.  It's exciting to see all these various music groups and young choirs popping up everywhere we turn.  These recent years have been just the beginning of an era that is seeing young Christian musicians bringing a spark of life to their churches, communities, and in some areas, entire counties.  People have sat up and taken note of the message as lives have been changed.<br /><br />Because these groups have had such obvious and tremendous effect on their audiences and have potential for so much more I believe it's essential that all of them have an opportunity to read this book.  I really dig this book!  Steve Hilson is a guy I've known for several years and I honestly believe he's done us all a big favor by compiling this mountain of information.<br /><br />I wish I could have gotten my hands on a book like this a long time ago.\\"really dig this book!

But we gradually discover that it is in the struggle itself, in the following of this star, that the implicit goal is attained.<br /><br />Told in the framework of classic Greek mythology clothed in the dream world of a modern mind, redolent of a love of Nature personified and of all natural things, iconoclastic in its destruction of present-day hypocrisies and shibboleths, this allegorical adventure still points beyond the obvious to a Dawn Country, ever distant yet ever within us, awaiting the spirit bold enough to set out on the arduous journey.<br /><br />The four Books of which the allegory is composed, The Hunter, The Rites of Autumn,  The Dark Tower Fell, and The Rites of Winter, trace the evolutionary struggles and aspirations of our protagonist, man, and of the gods he has created, from his most ancient beginnings as the maker, in his own crude image, of his first god, through a journey in time of discovery and insight; of pain and ecstasy; of triumph and defeat, leading to that highest of mountains, the final revelation of Zeus - outwardly his own creation, inwardly the embodiment of his essential self and the epitome of all that man is or ever wished to be.  But in the end Zeus still eludes him - pointing to farther journeys and higher stars-to man's eternal pathway into the limitless universe of his own mind and being....	2004-12-27

They'd have to watch themselves in a mirror, take extensive notes, and then spend months organizing and refining it all.<br /><br />Thats why it took Jerry's team of more than 30 slow motion video technicians, photographers, artists and illustrators to help Jerry turn those unconcscious techniques into clear diagrams and easy to understand explanations.  Because of this sort of painstaking detail it cost over $100,000 just to produce the manuscript for this one of a kind book.<br /><br />(This is an oversized paperback with 187 pages.

Their special magic lay in a self-styled mystique that came to be called \\"preciosite\\" - a blend  of other-worldliness and pampered fragility, artfulness and literary pretension.<br /><br />Dorothy Backer provides the first and only portrait of this regal elite - who reigned supreme until imitators turned their unique style into a popular fad.  She also portrays the men in their lives: the husbands who brutalized and indulged them, the royal lovers who pursued them, and the poets who sang their praises (usually in lamentable verse).  In telling their remarkable story, Professor Backer reveals why these very ladies who sighed over shallow literature, spoke in contrived metaphors, and ultimately became the target of Moliere's satire, were nevertheless the first women anywhere to band together in consciousness of their womanly plight.<br /><br />Here are such illustrious precieuses as Catherine d'Angennes (also reknown as \\"La Divine Arthenice\\"), Mme. des Loges (to whom Balzac wrote adminring letters), \\"Sapho,\\" the ultimate prude, and Ninon Lenclose, whose boudoir was a delightful refuge for the loftiest men of the age.  Professor Backer paints them all against the backdrop of their own world - a world in which a woman might be thrust into marriage before her thirteenth birthday, die of smallpox or agonizing childbirth, or see her husband slain in a duel.  Frivolous as they were, says the author, the Precieuses represented mothing less than a unified feminine attack against the madness and vulgaritly of that world.<br /><br />Precious Women tells their great, forgotten story.  It also rescues the small, but real, successes of this very early women's movement - buried, until now, under centuries of ridicule.	2004-12-13

Enticed by a member of the Israeli government, Scott and his parents moved to the \\"Holy Land\\" with promises of assistance in opening a health clinic.  Unbeknownst to the Rostons, however, the government official luring them to Israel was involved in high-level international crimes.<br /><br />Once in Israel, the friendly voice and attitude changed drastically.  Scott and his family were to find out how America's \\"friend\\" teats its guests.  Thrust into unsuitable accommodations with no choice of their own, the Rostons find themselves swept away by the flow of bureaucracy.  No complaints can be aired with any success; no action can turn the tide.  Finally, a chain of bizarre, darkly fascinating events leads Scott into the true nightmare: He is framed for a crime he didn't commit, falsely arrested, and unjustly imprisoned.  With the thought of escape driving him on, Scott discovers what really goes on in the name of justice in Israel and exposes the brutality of countless Americans, Arabs, and others - revealing the criminal violations of human rights which Amnesty International has been trying to prove for years!	2004-12-10

With the country's attention fixed on problems at home and the Korean War, the author's platoon is alone, searching for an enemy with no mercy and no rules in the midst of leeches, disease and frightened locals - only now have they had their story told.<br /><br />This is the story of 10 Platoon D Company The 1st Battalion The Worcestershires Regiment in Malaya.  No better and no worse than any other platoon and comprising Regulars and a motley group of National Servicemen butchers, bakers and the usual troublemakers. Set in the aftermath of the Second World War, those countries which had once been occupied by the now-defeated Japanese were left with only one thought in mind independence. Soon, countries such as Indo-China, Korea and Malaya were in open combat with communist guerrillas.<br /><br />Malaya was a British protectorate and any defeat for Britain could prove disastrous for the recovery of the British economy. It was into this scenario that 10 Platoon was thrust to fight a vicious enemy who asked for no quarter and to whom none was given. This fascinating book recounts the views and experiences of a Private Soldier of that Platoon in a very moving, forthright and straightforward way.	2004-10-11

And what are the methods of containment used in order to regulate the `vulgar mob'? These are just two of the questions elicited by Christian Nold in Mobile Vulgus.
