The main character, Daryn Alwyn, is a member of the genetic and economic elite called \\"pre-selects\\", as well as a member of one of the richest and most powerful families in the world - the Alwyns control the largest news network in the world. Daryn chooses not to use his family's wealth and sets out to make it on his own, first as an interstellar pilot and later as an independent artist/analyst. The first part of the novel consists of alternating chapters, switching back and forth from Daryn's youth to the present. I usually dislike this type of structure but Modesitt handles it perfectly, balancing the development of character, plot and setting perfectly. Towards the end of this section, the main conflict has been set up, and the last 200 pages are a page-turner leading to a very satisfying conclusion. The novel has a large number of similarities with \\"Archform: Beauty\\", another excellent stand-alone by Modesitt Jr.	2005-03-05

Main character Leo Graf is an engineer who is assigned to the quaddie project - quaddies being bioengineered humanoid workers who are specialized in freefall work because they have 4 arms rather than 2 arms and 2 legs. I've become a Bujold fan after reading a handful of Miles Vorkosigan novels, but this is by far the weakest novel I've read by the author. The plot is very thin and extremely predictable, the characters are flat, and if not for Bujold's talent in keeping the story moving and the dialogue lively, I would have ditched this book after 100 pages.	2004-11-30
US	52915545	RLPAFEAJARUT3	0932096263	673426799	Forty Thousand in Gehenna	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Fantastic colonization story - Classic Cherryh	\\"Forty Thousand In Gehenna\\" is the story of a newly colonized Union planet.  There is a twist on the standard colonization theme: the initial population of the colony is a small group of about 450 Union officers who will get the colony set up, using about 40000 'azi'.  Azi are cloned humans routinely used as workers or soldiers by Union, indoctrinated to obey authority unquestioningly (see also the brilliant novel \\"Cyteen\\").  The novel quickly changes from a colonization story to a chilling study of psychology when authority on the planet breaks down and the azi, for the first time in their lives, find themselves without any guidance.  This is Cherryh at her best - gritty, down-to-earth SF, told in a very matter-of-fact, no-frills prose style, uncompromising but very rewarding.  This is not the best entry point for the Union/Alliance series but one of the finest and most unique parts of it.	2004-11-05

The novel is set in Ankh-Morpork and deals with a con man who is forced to take over the management of the city's defunct postal system. I was pleased to see that my favorite DW character, Havelock Vetinari, plays a significant role in the story. Just like in \\"Monstrous Regiment\\", most of the cast of the novel is new, except for a short appearance by Captain Carrot, the undead lawyer Slant, and a few other returning characters who are only mentioned by name (Nobbs, Vimes). A fun treat: artwork of 'authentic' Ankh-Morpork postage stamps decorates every chapter. There are also a number of mentions of \\"Thud\\", the DW-themed strategy board game. The plot of the novel is adequate but maybe a bit predictable if you are familiar with Pratchett's style. This one is recommended for fans of the series, but probably not the best place to start for newcomers, despite the fact that this as much of a stand-alone novel as you'll find in the series.	2004-10-28

The gap between rich and poor has become (even) more pronounced, dividing society in different strata: filch ('filthy rich') and 'sariman' (salarymen, I think) have most of the wealth, 'permies' who have had their personality modified because of past crimes, and so on.  The story is told from the first-person perspective of 5 different characters: a music professor, an investigative journalist, a police detective, a senator and a businessman.  Modesitt demonstrates his experience by skillfully weaving these 5 very different and initially unconnected stories together towards a very satisfying climax.   <br />One of my favorite aspects of Modesitt's writing is his willingness to show, in great detail, the everyday, almost mundane aspects of life in a science fiction (or fantasy) society.  This slows the story down, probably to the point of annoyance for some readers, but at the same time it creates a more fully realized setting, which I really enjoyed.	2004-10-28

If you enjoyed \\"Perdido Street Station\\" and \\"The Scar\\", you will most probably enjoy this novel as well, even though it makes a while to get going. The first 100 pages or so had me thinking Mieville lost his touch, but the story picks up quickly after that. Even when the plot meanders, Mieville's prose is so gorgeous that it's hard to stop reading. Politics play a large part in the story: fascism, socialism, imperialism, racism (or speciesism) motivate the entire plot. However, like Guy Gavriel Kay at his best, Mieville never lets you forget that the people behind the politics are human. Judah, Cutter and (to a lesser degree) Ori are some of the most touching characters he has created so far. This is one of those rare novels that made me want to turn back to page 1 and start re-reading immediately. <br />	2004-10-21

Zettel won the Locus Award for Best New Novel for \\"Reclamation\\" and also wrote the New York Times Notable Book of the Year \\"Fool's War\\". <br />\\"Kingdom of Cages\\" is set in the far future. Humanity has colonized and spread out over countless planets. Recently, dozens of the colony planets are suffering environmental collapse and strange new diseases, threatening to wipe out the human race. One planet, Pandora, is untouched by this crisis. Pandora is the most Earth-like of all the planets and is kept in pristine shape by its inhabitants, ecologists and geneticists, who live in dome cities to study and preserve the natural riches of their planet. <br />As the story begins, representatives from the dying colony planets deliver an ultimatum: Pandora's brilliant scientists must find a cure for the impending crisis, or their untouched paradise will be destroyed. The main characters of the novel, the young girls Teal and Chena Trust, are chosen to participate in the \\"Eden Project\\" which will presumably save humanity. They quickly find out that Pandora's scientists may need more from them than they are willing to give. <br />\\"Kingdom of Cages\\" is an interesting novel which works on many levels: an environmental story, a science fiction novel and a coming of age tale. However, I found some plot elements unlikely or far-fetched, and some things are extremely over-simplified. This, combined with the young age of the two protagonists, make this novel sometimes resemble Young Adult or adolescent fiction. It's also disappointing that the resolution seems rushed and unsatisfactory after almost 600 pages. Despite all of this, \\"Kingdom of Cages\\" is not a bad read for young SF readers, fans of Sarah Zettel and maybe those who are particularly interested in ecology. <br />Note: The cover art, a piece by renowned fantasy artist Michael Whelan, is beautiful ... it doesn't seem to have much to do with the story.	2003-06-13

The novel is not a standard fantasy, but rather an alternate history novel with fantasy elements. It won a number of awards, including the 1997 Nebula Award for Best Novel (beating the favorite &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; by George R. R. Martin). <br />The story is set in 17th century France, during the reign of the Sun King Louis XIV, at his court in Versailles. The novel is filled with a large cast of courtiers, many of them historical figures, who are all competing for the favor of the King. The main character, Marie-Josephe de la Croix, assists her brother, Father Yves de la Croix, in the scientific study of a recently captured sea monster. The King hopes to gain immortality by consuming part of the creature, but as the study continues, Marie-Josephe discovers the sea monster may be more than a dumb beast. This discovery tests Marie-Josephe's loyalty to her brother, her king and her religion. <br />Vonda McIntyre thoroughly researched the historical setting for &quot;The Moon and the Sun&quot; and created a very convincing setting, filling it with believable and well-rounded characters. Because of the level of detail, the novel can be enjoyed as a historical novel and a fantasy. Very highly recommended. <br />Note: the novel originated as a short story, written in the form of a fictional encyclopedia article, &quot;The Natural History and Extinction of the People of the Sea&quot;, which was illustrated by (fellow author) Ursula K. Le Guin and indirectly inspired by research done by the late Avram Davidson, another brilliant SF writer. The novel also exists as a screenplay.	2003-06-08

A large part of this novel gives a semi-realistic portrayal of the life of a grunt in a medieval army - including weapon drills, digging jacks, and the thrill of the first battle. Meanwhile, the fantasy world starts to flesh out with its own geography, history and mythology. The novel finishes with a satisfying conflict that will want you to get part 2 of &quot;The Deed of Paksenarrion&quot; as soon as you can. <br />If you enjoy good fantasy, you will probably enjoy this novel. If you enjoyed &quot;Ash: A Secret History&quot; by Mary Gentle and &quot;The Black Company&quot; by Glen Cook, you absolutely have to buy this book.	2001-07-24

He's well known for his Vlad Taltos series, which are set in the Dragaeran empire, an extremely well constructed fantasy world featuring 17 races of Dragaerans and 1 race of Easterners (or humans). &quot;The Phoenix Guards&quot; is set in the same empire but about 1000 years before the birth of Vlad Taltos.  In my opinion, this novel is interesting for fans of the Taltos series for two main reasons: <br />1. It shows some of the earlier history of the Dragaeran empire, but from the point of view of a Dragaeran, not from the human point of view of Vlad Taltos. Not only is the main character, Khaavren, a Dragaeran (a Tiassa to be more precise), but the fictional narrator of the story, Paarfi, is a also a Dragaeran. <br />2. The writing style, which echoes the style of Alexandre Dumas. Imagine long, very intricately constructed sentences, and a focus on very formal, over-polite conversation. (The title of the sequel to this novel, &quot;Five Hundred Years After&quot;, is a very obvious reference to &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; by Dumas.) The style is about as far removed from the laconical, witty tone of the Taltos novels. <br />I enjoyed reading this one more for the curiosity factor than for the actual quality of the novel. The plot is full of intrigue and action, and the characters are likeable enough, but the prose style simply becomes grating after a while. Recommended for Brust fans only.	2001-07-22

Mendoza is rescued from the Spanish Inquisition and sent to Elizabethan England to collect botanical samples from the garden of Sir Walter Iden. <br />&quot;In The Garden Of Iden&quot; combines some of Kage Barker's strongest passions: she is an authority on Tudor-era England, has a strong interest in botany, and a preoccupation with conspiracy theories.

Brust is still working on his fabulous Taltos series, and Lindholm is of course better known as Robin Hobb.  So here we have a collaboration between two of my favorite  authors ... and I didn't enjoy it at all.<br />&quot;The Gypsy&quot; seems an  odd mix of present-day cop drama and fantasy-like mystic gypsy stuff.  I  know that sounds vague, but that's about the most flattering description I  can come up with.  Apart from one or two exceptions, the characters are  cardboard and the dialogue is depressingly bad.<br />The main problem with the  novel, in my opinion, is the general vagueness of the gypsy sections.  It's  very hard to link these sections with the sections on Stepovich and Durand.   Moreover, the evil demoness who is trying to acquire more power is such a  tired cliche - just like the good cop/bad cop idea and the teenage girl  being subverted by the powers of evil.  <br />I really wanted to like this  novel, but ended up struggling through it.  If you're thinking of getting  this one, I'd recommend anything else written by Steven Brust (e.g.  &quot;The Book of Jhereg&quot;) or Robin Hobb/Megan Lindholm (e.g. the  &quot;Assassin&quot; series) instead.	2000-04-27

The first one, 'Consider Phlebas', is generally not considered the best of the series.  Even though I was very impressed by 'Consider Phlebas', I can now see, after having read 'The Player of Games', what  Banks is capable of. <br />Gurgeh, the protagonist of the novel, is a 'morat'  or 'player of games'.  He is one of the most talented players in the  Culture.  He is versed in the rules of all the known games and wins many  competitions.  He even publishes papers on game theory - in the luxurious  Culture, gaming has become an academic field, and Gurgeh is at the top of  it.  He is , basically, the ultimate 'grognard'. Gurgeh's fair-play becomes  intentionally compromised by a 'drone', one of the Culture's artificial  intelligences.  He is forced to leave the Culture on a mission to the  Empire of Azad.  The Azadian Empire is a newly discovered area of the  Galaxy, which hasn't been incorporated into the Culture yet.  What's so  special about this empire is that the game Azad, an incredibly complex  board game, determines people's careers and lives. From the moment Gurgeh  enters the Azadian Empire, the contrast with the Culture gets more and more  emphasized.  The Culture is the ideal society.  Technology has reached such  a high level that everybody has access to everything, money is no longer  necessary and crime is non-existent.  Azad, by contrast, seems remarkably  close to our Western civilization.  And into this Empire, the Player of  Games arrives with a mission he himself is not fully aware of.<br />This novel  shows an amount of flair worthy of, let's say, Jack Vance.  Banks creates a  believable character that will be loved by everyone who has ever played a  strategy game, and then sends that character through an amazing amount of  thrills and excitement.  I used the word 'sensawunda' in my review of  'Consider Phlebas' - but 'The Player of Games' trumps the earlier novelin  that respect easily.  This is some of the most exciting SF I've read in the  last years.  Very highly recommended.	2000-04-25

Donaldson, probably best known for his fantasy epic &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever&quot;, delivers his second collection of shorter work in &quot;Reave The Just And Other Tales&quot;.   Although uneven in quality, there are a lot of goodies here for Donaldson  fans.<br />Apart from the duology &quot;Mordant's Need&quot;, Donaldson's work  is often serious in tone, dealing with moral/ethical questions.  Likewise,  the stories in this collection seem to focus mostly on themes like justice,  sin and redemption.<br />Donaldson likes to draw his moral dramas with broad  strokes and wide settings.  When using the shorter form, the intensity of  the moral drama becomes so strong that the tales resemble parables rather  than short stories.  Specifically in &quot;The Djinn Who Watches Over The  Accursed&quot; and in the title story, the protagonists resemble  incarnations of ideas, not so much real people.  Combined with Donaldson's  formal, stately prose style, this often leads to a &quot;processional pace  and mood&quot;, to quote another reviewer.<br />Favorite stories are  &quot;Penance&quot;, one of the most moving and psychologically insightful  vampire stories I ever read, and &quot;The Djinn Who Watches Over The  Accursed&quot;, an interesting and fable-like meditation on being cursed.   Other very strong entries: &quot;The Kings of Tarshish Shall Bring  Gifts&quot; and &quot;The Woman Who Loved Pigs&quot;.   The only real  clunker in this collection is &quot;What Makes Us Human&quot;.  It's the  only science fiction story in this predominantly fantasy collection.  Apart  from that, the lighter style makes it seem a bit of a throw-away story.   Not surprisingly, this is the oldest story in the collection.<br />Over all,  this is a strong collection.  Donaldson, a master of the long form,  demonstrates that he can condense his style effectively in shorter works.	2000-04-22

Banks for ages, with almost unanymous praise, I finally decided to check out some of his works.  The author writes both regular fiction (under the name Iain Banks) and science  fiction (under the name Iain M. Banks).  His &quot;Culture&quot; novels  fall under the SF category, and &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; is generally  considered the best starting point.<br />The setting for this novel is the  galaxy-wide war between the technology-driven Culture and the religious  Idirans.  The Culture is a loose group of human planets, living in wealth  and freedom through their powerful technology.  The true masters of the  Culture are the Minds, incredibly powerful artificial intelligences, often  fitted in big ships like GCU (General Contact Units) or GSV (General System  Vehicles).<br />One of these Minds is lost at the beginning of the story.  The  Idirans want to capture it, because studying it will provide them with  useful techonological knowledge in the war.  The Culture wants to prevent  them from finding it, for obvious reasons.<br />Horza, a human shape-changer  employed on the Idiran side, is sent out to find the lost Mind.  In his  search, he teams up with a group of mercenaries and, after many adventures,  travels to the planet where the Mind is hiding out.<br />&quot;Consider  Phlebas&quot; is a very exciting novel, filled with aliens, immense  space-ships, Orbitals, ...  Everything you need for a good, old-fashioned,  sensawunda-filled space opera.  If that's what you enjoy reading, look no  further.  I'm definitely looking forward to the rest of the Culture series.	2000-04-16

Like Crispin,  he arrives in the city to exercise his craft, but he also becomes entangled  in the web of political and personal rivalries.  Rustem's son, Shaski,  provides one of the closest links to Kay's previous novels &quot;The Lions  of Al-Rassan&quot;.<br />I enjoyed this novel even more than its already  brilliant predecessor.  The characters continue to flesh out.  The plot  becomes more and more complex.  The conclusion of the novel is very  satisfying, although the epilogue, in my eyes, seems a bit rushed.<br />All in  all, this is another brilliant effort by one of the best fantasy writers on  the scene today.  If you're new to Guy Gavriel Kay and you enjoy fantasy,  buy Tigana, A Song for Arbonne, and the novels mentioned in this review  immediately!	2000-04-09

After a string of fabulous single-volume novels, he has now published the duology &quot;The Sarantine Mosaic&quot;. This story appears to be set in the same  world as &quot;The Lions of Al-Rassan&quot;, but in a different country and  time.  Still, there are references to Esperana, Trakesia and other  countries in both novels.  And once again this is a historical novel  disguised as a fantasy novel.  Magic doesn't play a very strong part, and  anyone with some basic notions of history can draw easy parallels between  this novel's characters and settings, and their real-world counterparts.   Still, the novel will be enjoyable even if you are not familiar with the  historical period. When someone says they are &quot;sailing to  Sarantium&quot; (an obvious reference to &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot;  by W. B. Yeats), it means they are going through a time of change, even  upheaval, in their lives.  Likewise, the major characters in this novel are  experiencing change.  The mosaicist Crispin, the guard Vargos and the  former slave Kasia arrive in the city of Sarantium.  This is the story of  how they arrive there, and how the city influences them, and vice versa. I  can't urge you enough to buy this novel, and any others by Guy Gavriel Kay  you can find.	2000-04-03

It's an interesting one, as it takes place between two of the earlier books in the series.  It's basically a parallel story line, showing  events that are briefly mentioned in the other books, but from a different  perspective.  Don't read this one before you read the first 4 novels in the  series - you won't understand what's going on.  But if you've read those 4,  by all means, get this book - it's simply an excellent novel.  Highly  recommended!	2000-03-22
US	52915545	RWJKLLYKGAVYK	0380791269	858619462	The Gilded Chain:: A Tale of the King's Blades (Tales of the King's Blades Series)	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Solid, traditional fantasy	This is a traditional fantasy novel, following the life of one of the King's Blades - a group of elite swordsmen, trained from an early age on to become the best and ultimately be &quot;bound&quot; to one person.  The  story contains many familiar fantasy themes, but it's told in a fast-paced  and always entertaining way.  The real themes of the novel are honor and,  most importantly, loyalty: Blades are magically bound to a person and  cannot help but protect and even die for their wards.  All in all, a good,  entertaining read.	2000-02-11

The story is set in Thailand.  If you've ever backpacked through Thailand, you will read about  many familiar feelings and sights in the country.  An enjoyable novel.	2000-02-04
US	52915545	R1B4THQO2V2G3G	0812524802	688034485	Moving Mars: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good, solid SF story.	I couldn't help but compare this novel to K.S. Robinson's &quot;Red/Green/Blue Mars&quot; series.  This novel has a less ambitious scope, but feels much more solid.  The main character's growth is great to  read, as she plays a pivotal role in the politics of the young Martian  colony. As in KSR's trilogy, politics play a large part in this novel, so  some people will probably find it too dry... but it's really a fascinating  read with interesting, believable characters.  Recommended.	2000-01-30
US	52915545	R3COGN6U8A5MTR	0441006159	45282071	The Book of Jhereg	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Excellent collection of the first 3 Taltos novels	This book contains the first 3 installments in the Vlad Taltos series (&quot;Jhereg&quot;, &quot;Yendi&quot; and &quot;Teckla&quot;).  The main character, Vlad, is a human assassin living in a society dominated by  Dragaerans (a magic-wielding race, divided into 17 noble houses that are  constantly scheming and plotting against each other).  The stories are told  from Vlad's point-of-view, so you will get to know this smart, witty and  deadly character and his jhereg familiar quite well.  These books are  simply a pleasure to read!  Since Yendi and Teckla are both out of print at  this moment, this is a great opportunity to get into this wonderful series.   Highly recommended!	2000-01-20

The story is fast-paced, with some of the most intense action scenes I've ever read.  As usual, the  characters are well drawn and the setting is realistic and detailed.  After  the disappointing &quot;A Quantum Murder&quot;, this is a wonderful way to  conclude the series.  Recommended if you enjoy fast-paced, near-future SF.	2000-01-14

The story is divided between more narrators than usual, which makes it lose some of its coherence.  I'm also not crazy about the sudden emphasis on religion and  gods.  The first 4 books gave a very human, soldierly face to fantasy, but  in &quot;Dreams of Steel&quot; we suddenly get superbeings influencing the  action.  Not my favorite example of the series, but still worth reading.	1999-12-20

It features the same set of characters, the same down-to-earth style, and the same fast-paced adventure.  As with  the other Black Company books, this one is highly recommended to all  fantasy fans!	1999-12-15

Read the first 2 novels first, then get this one.  The whole trilogy is excellent and  deserved much more commercial success than it got.	1999-12-13

This second installment in the Black Company series is even better than the first one.  The return of Croaker, One-Eye, Goblin and the others is wonderful, the story is fast-paced.  It's simply a pleasure to read.  Save  yourself some time and order &quot;The Black Company&quot;, &quot;Shadows  Linger&quot; and &quot;The White Rose&quot; at the same time.	1999-12-13
US	52915545	R1LBB27XXZM9YP	0553576380	694600051	Noir	Books	2	6	9	N	N	Lots of promise, but not reward ...	I really tried to like this book.  I think the concept of seeing the world through a filter of 'noir' is awesome.  I also think the setting of this novel is very interesting in a Gibsonesque way. But.  When I noticed the  protagonist is called McNihil, and an office early in the book is called  &quot;Foucault &amp; Derrida&quot;, I felt like throwing the book out of  the window.   IMO, this book has some very good ideas, but the execution is  awful  I gave up on reading it 20 pages from the end - too irritating. I  expected more from a personal friend of PKD.	1999-12-05

McKillip manages to avoid the usual fantasy cliches and creates some new (at least new to me) concepts, e.g. the land-rule idea.  She builds a believable world with believable characters.   The story moves along nicely to a strong climax.  Recommended.	1999-11-24

It's a great fantasy novel.  It's chilling in its realism.  Glen Cook deserves the commercial success of Robert Jordan.	1999-11-10
