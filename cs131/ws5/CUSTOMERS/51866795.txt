There are plenty of varied examples and exercises to work through and perfect your analytical skills.  This book was written for your typical youth who is just starting out in the arts of persuasion, and I, having been already well versed in these subjects didn't find the book all that useful. <br /> <br />I did do a spattering of exercises, and found the examples used were pertinent, and a few of them were quite challenging.  This book would probably be quite beneficial to teens and those about to enter college.   <br /> <br />The book has a Christian bent, which is not objectionable to me (I being a Christian myself). This book would even be useful to young people of any faith, and the Christian themes are not overpowering. <br /> <br />Among the most interesting of the examples and exercises are historical examples including the discovery of Pluto and the gunfight at the OK Corral.  If you are a young person about to enter college or know one, get them this book.  It will give them a head start in formulating arguments and defending against some of the academic idiocies that are like a plague in this country.   <br />	2005-07-10

In this book, long time traveler and heavy drinker turned fake family man P.J. O'Rourke writes about his visits to Terrorist hot spot Egypt, he discusses nation building in Kosovo, he walks in recently conquered Baghdad, and he takes on hippie protestors marching in Washington D.C. <br /> <br />P.J. O'Rourke has authored numerous works of this kind; they're basically the observations of a storied traveler pretending to be a serious journalist in some of the most dangerous places on the planet.  Some of his other work in the arena includes \\"Holidays in Hell\\" and \\"All the Trouble in the World.\\"  It almost makes the reader wonder what P.J. did to make his assignment editors so angry.  That's what also makes most of his works so much fun, O'Rourke approaches deadly situations with humor and pith. <br /> <br />In the funny department, this is O'Rourke's best work.  His opening essay discusses why American's hate foreign policy.  This essay has got to be the best work ever for P.J.  It is so dense, nearly every sentence brings either a thought or a laugh, and despite how funny the essay is, O'Rourke finds truth.  American's do hate foreign policy, and we should.  O'Rourke also dissects that the stances of other nations, and makes a humorous case for unilateralism. <br /> <br />However, O'Rourke doesn't live up to expectation.  The final essay of the book, the climax, his description of conquered Iraq, is a huge letdown.  I doubt it's for any fault of O'Rourke's. he just wasn't exposed to anything more exciting than aid truck queues.  This is still a must read, and it beats any of O'Rourke's other travel tails of mayhem.  <br />	2005-06-04

He was also well known for his cameos on Cheers, where he swindled Norm, Cliff and crew with relative ease.  Harry Anderson was also a successful magician, and has hosted several cable specials on the subject. <br /> <br />Before all of that, Harry Anderson was a con man, and a good one at that.  In this little volume, Anderson sets forth a number of entertaining cons, and strategies that can be used at the bar.  For the most part, these swindles are not going to make you rich.  In fact, these cons are immediately apparent for most people.  If they are not apparent from the start, they will be apparent at the conclusion.  It is because of this that Mr. Anderson declares that you must perform these tricks in an entertaining way, or else you might run into some well deserved violence. <br /> <br />This book is not supposed to be a definitive list of street crime.  What this book really represents is a system of thinking, a system that you can use to create more of your own games that can provide some fun at the bar. <br /> <br />Anderson also has a decent field guide to avoiding scams.  Casinos, carnivals, and street cons are all described.  For many people, this should be required reading. <br /> <br />This book is extremely entertaining.  Harry Anderson writes in a quick and witty style that gives the reader the sense that Anderson is a throwback to the speakeasies and mobster era.  <br /> <br />If you're looking to make money scamming John Q. Public, don't buy this book.  If you're looking for a quick and entertaining read that is fairly informative and will provide you some interesting time killers, get this book.  <br />	2005-05-11

He provides a good system of general categories of each, along with hilarious ability to describe the quirks that one can manipulate. <br /> <br />His advice for surviving in the office, warning signs that you're about to be fired, and shenanigans are all worthy of multiple readings.  Having friends that work in cubicle farms, I have seen firsthand how true Mr. Pollack's observations are.   <br /> <br />The best part is he wrote the entire book while at work, on someone else's dime.

His first section on human nature, where he makes the case against the argument that all people are basically good is worth the price of admission.

To be cliche, it reads like a novel.  Rasimus, a F-105 fighter pilot during his first tour in Vietnam, gives us a clear picture of the life of a fighter during the 1966 Rolling Thunder campaign.  Rasimus gives us some priceless scenes, from his completion of the 100 missions, to his interaction with the CIA, to the loss of his friends. <br /> <br />In the end, those losses, and the huge losses suffered by F-105 pilots, begged the question that Rasimus gingerly touched on.  Why were people dying in Vietnam in a war no one in the Johnson administration wanted to win?  As one reads this book, frustration builds.  It's a frustration shared by the author.  Why weren't they allowed to bomb targets of opportunity?  Why were they restricted from a giant chunk of North Vietnam?  Why were generals and colonels so detached?  Why were men dying pushing dirt around river fords?  The answers have been few and far between.  McNamara, the Secretary of Defense at the time, went to his grave not knowing what he did wrong, other than being in Vietnam in the first place. <br /> <br />But these frustrations don't interfere with the readability of this work.  Rasimus' descriptions of the cockpit, the aircraft, and the tactics are so clear that laymen have a perfect reference for what the war in Vietnam was like for f-105s.  At times, Mr. Rasimus gets technical, but it is always followed by explanation.  This book is for anyone interested in aviation, history, or the Vietnam War.	2005-01-07

This book was written well before the 2004 presidential election, in it a prominent and successful lifetime Democrat tells the world that his party is no longer one that can hold or hope to hold any national majority; in it he warns of the errors in thought and philosophy that his party is making; in it he predicts failure at the national level for his party.  All these things are true, and 2004 proved that at the national level, the Democrats are failures. This book helps explain why. For these reasons alone, this book should be read.	2005-01-04

Books	5	2	4	N	N	Dated but still valid, and very funny.	PJ is a very funny man.  His ideas about life on this planet are not based on any deep philosophy, but a sense of detachment and irreverence.  This detachment, irreverence, and his lack of concern for his own safety culminate nicely in this international brew. <br /> <br />There are two noteworthy chapters.  The first is his visit to Beirut, in Lebanon.  This is written in a classic traveler's guide style.  So much so, that it seems very weird at first.  Like when O'Rourke is describing bodies in ditches as being part of the tour, or when bribes and beatings, shootings and bombings, are mentioned as essential to the character of Beirut.  PJ has a very scary sense of humor.  The second noteworthy chapter is the treatise on Euro-Weenies.  This, like much of the book, is still applicable today. <br /> <br />Other than the stuff on communism, this book could have been written yesterday.  It should be on the essential reading list of everybody. <br />	2005-01-04

I found it an interesting read, there are a lot of statistics that one has to believe.  One knows that minorities are a growing segment of the population.  One has to believe that cities and their suburbs (So called \\"Ideolopolises\\") are growing at a substantial rate.  But that is where belief in me ends.  This book makes an error in philosophy, the authors buy the idea of identity politics.  This idea, this belief, is that a person is most likely to vote based on a few measurable elements of their race, socio-economic status, and location.  Unfortunately, as this recent election proves, this is fallacy.  And so is the book.  Democrats cannot hope for demographics to return to power, they must now turn and examine their ideology, and that always hurts. <br />	2004-12-29

It tends to be subtle, and much like the language, it tends to emphasis different elements of funny.  Aericans demand a punchline, whereas or brothers across the pond seem to only need an unusual situation.  British humor is one where the circumstances are funny, and the climax is unimportant.  Cecil writes with this delicate form of humor, this British sense of situation and circumstance.  His characters are the caricatures of believable personalities, and his tale of justice stems from his own great experience as a Judge for Her Majesty. <br /> <br />This book is a crime novel.  There's no mystery to it, we know from the start who the killers are, how and why they killed.  The protaganist, Alec Moreland, commits murder for only the most upright and moral reasons.  He performs nearly the perfect murder.  Eventually, the police knock on his door, and he and his fiance panic.  Enter Ambrose Low, an intelligent and slick stockbroker with a penchant for solving problems.  Low's goal is to get Moreland acquitted.  The road after is a series of homurous circumstances and situations that one cannot but love for their near believablitiy. <br /> <br />One of the interesting devices Cecil uses is to have long dialogues of testimony.  He does this a lot, many times it shows the near idiocy of standard lawyerly witness questioning, and sometimes it show the near incomprehensibility of witness testimony.  This book is a quick and delightful read. <br /> <br />	2004-12-27

Simply, college can be a new level of liberal.  Ben Shapiro, presently closing in on his twenty-first birthday, was sixteen when he first entered college at Berkeley.  He was a conservative young student from a devoutly religious Jewish family.  Four years later, he is the youngest syndicated columnist and the author of \\"Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America's Youth.\\" <br /> <br />You can tell by reading the book that Shapiro was shocked at every turn in his four years at Berkeley.  Personally, I can't blame him.  College is shockingly liberal.  Among the many stats that Shapiro quotes in his book, one is most telling.  Nine percent of Professors voted for Bush in 2000.  That's across the board.  University professors are liberal, and if they aren't liberal, they're communist.  Dealing with the incredible control the left has in universities both public and private is the purpose Ben Shapiro has given himself with this book. <br /> <br />For the first hundred pages, Shapiro uses lots of documented cases of professors' irrational hatred of the United States.  Professors' views are given lots of coverage, at times, the book is quite dull because he's just listing the names of professors that signed some stupid peace document or protested some Israeli self-defense measure.  It gets a little tedious, and he never actually challenges or refutes the professors' positions. He assumes that common sense people know these professors' assertions are wrong. <br /> <br />After all that, Shapiro then gives a short chapter on what can be done to weaken the leftist control of American institutions of higher learning.  Though his answer to the problems are most likely off, and Shapiro doesn't spend any time refuting arguments, this book is a good read for a few reasons. <br /> <br />First, it's strong documentation of just how liberal professors across the country truly are.  Second, there are some interesting anecdotes from Ben Shapiro's own college experience that makes some of the incidents one might encounter a little less shocking.  And thirdly, it's another book that is putting the spotlight on American colleges and is one of the first trying to answer the question, \\"what is a conservative to do in college?\\" <br /> <br />Sure, Mr. Shapiro is quite young, and his writing reflects that.  Some of his conclusions are nave.  However, this is a must read for conservative parents or students. <br />	2004-08-17

To be honest, what I read didn't surprise me at all. <br /> <br />Firstly, among the various recommended methods of convincing people to vote against Bush, was a simple bit of advice: pretend to be a disgruntled Republican.  Write letters, or call in to talk shows, and pretend to be a Republican disgusted with Bush's ultra-conservatism or warmongering.  Never minding the commandment that this suggestion breaks, this is an example of pure disgusting dirty tricks that I would expect of win at any cost leftys. <br /> <br />Also, a few ideas are pure garbage.  One was dressing up as a rabbit, and sitting around telling people you are `hopping mad' at the Bush administration.  If you don't mind being made a fool of, I say go for it. <br /> <br />There were other usefull suggestions, building email lists, online campaigning and registration guides, but the average angry radical will find this book wanting.  And unconvincing. <br /> <br />Pretense is the basis of this book.  Pretend to be homeless, pretend to be Republican, pretend you like the Democrat more than Nader.  It's a good example of what bare bones intellect the average liberal activist puts into winning the hearts and minds of USA voters.  This book at least gave me some optimism, if Bush makes people this mad than he's doing the right thing.  As for winning elections, try being honest with people and winning the war of ideas.  That war is difficult to win while wearing a bunny suit. <br />	2004-08-13

With exhausting notes and quotations, and daunting research, every possible detail that is important to the story of the raid and the men is given.

There's a fascinating short biography in the book of Jimmy Doolittle, one of our nation's greatest aviators.  There is the story of the POW camps after the fact and the conversion of Jacob DeShazer, who would later be a leading evangelist in Japan.  Much information is given to the planes themselves, the B-24s that carried the weapons of the raid.  This book combines all those great elements into one very readable volume.	2004-07-13

You get from Noonan the love she had for Reagan, and it's a love we all should have for Reagan.  I would not call this a perfect biography.  Noonan passes over many of Reagan's faults.  However, Reagan was an amazing man, the more I read about him, the more there is to admire.  Readable.  That's the best word, the book is incredibly readable, and you should read it.	2004-05-11

The fact that our society spends about four hundred billion dollars trying to influence two trillion dollars in government expenditures (about twenty percent of the total) shows what an inefficient mess our economy has become.  This fact of wasted wealth should shock the reader.  I couldn't believe it at first.  The amount of research used is impressive and definitive.

Though I lived in the Midwest, I had never heard of him until I was on a road trip and heard him on the radio completely by chance.  Since then I have started listening to his radio program on a pay site he has over the Internet.  However, Beck's radio talents do nothing for his writing talents.  When I first started reading this book, I couldn't believe how bad it was.  Most of Beck's thoughts are incoherent, he tries humor and fails, and he is just overall unable to put his thoughts to paper very well.  Later, towards the end of the book, Beck gives an explanation as to why the book is below par when he tells his readers that he wrote the book quickly while on a road trip.  He pumped out this book in the back of a car.  It was finished quickly, hastily, and it shows.<br />To say that this was a disappointing revelation is obvious.  You'd think Glenn Beck would have some respect for his readers.  He should've taken the time to write this book well.  He didn't.  I like Glenn Beck, I like his radio program, but the stuff he felt fit to print was unfortunate.  His story of his alcoholism was honest but lacked feeling.  His thoughts on big business, partisan politics, and Hollywood were unmemorable.  His ideals of what a real America should be weren't thought out.  Even the story of how he found religion was a bit freakish.  He became a Mormon because he was always surrounded by Mormons and they were always good people.  He completely avoids discussing the Book of Mormon or their habits about baptizing dead people.  I would think that picking a religion for yourself and your family would be a reasonable process.<br />To his credit, towards the end of the book his writing started to come together a little, and it was more enjoyable.  Overall, I'd give it two and half stars, but I'll raise it up to 3 stars for a conservative who will hopefully and has the ability to write a good book in the future.	2004-01-31

The tales of Satchel and Bucky are always funny, and the irreverent dialogue is at times brilliant.  Conley does a good job maintaining story lines in his daily cartoons, and often those storylines last far longer than most other cartoonists will venture them.  But this book is not without some problems.  In many of his earlier Get Fuzzy collections, Conley avoids using his comic to spread his political beliefs.  However, in Blueprint for Disaster, Conley eventually lets go and has some anti-war messages, negative references to Pat Buchanan, and at times Bucky becomes the embodiment of what Conley thinks of Republicans; to quote the middle comic on page 103 a personality test describes Bucky Katt as \\"...ignorant, arrogant, close-minded and hostile\\" and we find on page 111 that Bucky Katt is a Pat Buchanan fan.  While 98% of this book is the wonderful Get Fuzzy that I love, the negative references to conservatives are nearly enough to prevent me from buying another Get Fuzzy collection.	2004-01-06

The storyline feels thrown together, the ending is forced, and the ability of the text to hold an audience is poor.  Though there were a few bright spots, this book was a large disappointment.  However, the Hitchhikers Guide five book trilogy and the first Dirk Gently novels are wonderful.  Don't read this, it just disappoints.  At best, it's a B-.	2004-01-06

However, for those that are starting out on their Dilbert trek, I would recommend reading \\"Still Pumped from using the Mouse\\" or \\"I'm not Anti-business, I'm Anti-idiot\\" before purchasing this collection.  Scott Adams did most of his damage in the late 90's and has not been able to pick up any momentum.  Sometimes it feels like some of the newer Dilberts are just not as funny or even recycled.  However, this book still has some great laughs and storylines.  For the office slave worker, Dilbert will probably never cease to be funny.  If you love Dilbert, you're going to buy this book anyway, and if you're just sort of interested, you should by some of the earlier ones.	2004-01-05

As a reviewer, there is not much more to add than to say that this book is a classic, and that history deems it so, and you should read it.  I guess I should try to do better than that...read this book...or else risk being called a loser...okay, that failed.<br />The Art of War is important for anybody, after having read this book, I found numerous tidbits of advice and ways of thinking that I could use towards my hum drum college life.  This edition also gives the reader historical information that is invaluable to those who like history.  Translation notes are along with the text, and even some old never before published tomb texts are in this translation.  This is a complete volume for the home library, and at the very least I can say you need to read this book.	2003-12-24

What did More intend when he wrote it, is it a satire or a vision of the perfect society, all are questions people try to ask in their reviews of this volume.  Having read this book twice, both times for college courses, I can tell you that the Dover Thrift edition is wonderful, the book is wonderful, the price it right, and you need to read this book.  Afterwards, I encourage you to join the debate, something all books strive to do, and greats ones excel at.	2003-12-12

I bought it anyway, and started reading it when I got home.  I read the entire book that evening, and read it twice the following day.  It is that hilariously funny, and very well written.  I can't say enough good things about this book.  Mr. Perry's description of his home life, and characterizations of the umpires he would become intimate with over the years are wonderful.  This book rates as the best biography of a baseball player ever.  Nowhere is humor and readability combined with the history and making of great ballplayers.  Get this book and read it, and I should add, no baseball book I have read deserves another printing more than \\"Me and the Spitter\\".	2003-12-12

After the last decade of reading, I have seen some really terrible things purporting to be &#34;Novels&#34; which don't meet the broad definition of &#34;literature&#34;. I reread this book recently and wanted to give it an upgrade. It has all the elements a novel should have, it's a coherent story, with plots and themes and characters. With the deluge of self-published junk pouring out of Amazon, a book like this is actually a welcome respite.	2003-10-05

There are so few people up on the modern student services fees process that public universities have been able to manipulate the system to their own agendas. But if you are at a public university, and you are interested in learning how the fees money that is taken from you is allocated, then you need this book.<br />If you think what you need to do is focus on eliminating fees, you're wrong, and this book will tell you why. If you think that your fees process at your university is fair, you're wrong, and this book will tell you why. If you're a conservative activist on campus and think you and your cause shouldn't get involved in fees, you're wrong, and this book will tell you why.<br />Included in this book is a step by step process that will tell you the history of student services fees, how they moved on from legitimate student services to an intensely liberal institution. How court cases over the last 20 years have ended the present hope of many conservatives to end mandatory fees systems, court cases that are included in the book. A guide to legal terms, and a suggestion on where to go from today's system to a fair system that includes all viewpoints.

As the head writer and later the star of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 television series and movie, Mike Nelson created a fan base with his wit and utterly shameless clowning.  Following his successes in TV, he went on to write the wonderful book `Mike Nelson's Movie Megacheese'.  In this book he tries to get away from his movie roles and show everyone that the world around him is at times stupid, and at times weird.<br />This book was not written for fans of MST3K, this book was written for anyone that wanted a laugh.  At times, Nelson fails to stay away from movie and TV reviews, but in the whole he does a stand up job of offering essays on life today for the average six foot two Midwesterner who happens to be famous.<br />Among the better essays are his experiences in hotel rooms, a hilarious treatise on mud baths, and even a look at married life.  All the essays are short; Nelson is an experienced wordsmith that does not waste space.  One cannot but admire Mike's vocabulary and knowledge, however it seems at times he's using big words just for their own sake.  Any reader, fan of MST3K or not will love reading this book.  It's not a classic, in fact it has nowhere near the literary value of his `Megacheese,' but it still gets an A- from me.<br />Go ahead and read this book, it's worth the effort, and its cool blue cover color scheme helps relax the soul.	2003-08-05

Lately, having read some of Art Bell's columns in the After Dark Newsletter, his writing has greatly improved.  This is the first hurdle you have to jump if you are to enjoy this book. <br />Another hurdle, you have to be a fan of Art Bell. In this book he discusses some of his personal history, but doesn't go into a lot of detail.  He also does not give any tips to people interested in talk radio.<br />Personally, I loved it.<br />So, if you're willing to handle substandard writing, lack of depth, and aren't interested in getting into the profession of talk radio, then you will like this book.  If you fail to meet these criteria, don't buy this book.  If you are interested in conspiracy, UFO's, and weather, by all means buy some of Art's other books, this one does not go into any of that though.  This book targets a very small market of people; before you buy, make sure you're in it.	2003-05-06

As a long time conservative, one experienced with college debate, column writing, and politicking I didn't think that I would get a lot out of this book.  Nor is the book targeted to people like me; Rationally Right is for young people who are looking for a political philosophy, or people who have a hard time understanding the liberal versus conservative media blitz.  However, this book is more broad sweeping than that.<br />In Rationally Right we find both the conservative and liberal political paradigms presented in the simplest possible terms. Like any good engineer Meyer understands the beauty of parsimony. Though this book is trying to persuade people towards conservatism, everyone should read it. Nowhere else can you get a better description of conservatism.<br />In this book we learn why conservatives are against nationalized healthcare, against gun control, taxes, and state dependency.  Meyer uses lots of personal anecdotes as well as solid real world examples that support the conservative viewpoint. At times Meyer can be too simplistic, and some things are rushed over. However, this isn't a book of deep political philosophy like Robert Nozick's \\"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\\" or John Rawls' \\"Theory of Justice as Fairness\\", this book is for those just starting up, or for old warhorses that have lost sight of the big picture.<br />This book is for everyone interested in politics today. At times it's enlightening, and most definitely fresh, Meyer has written a beauty. And the guy's from Minnesota, so you know he's nice.	2003-05-04

Books	5	18	20	N	Y	Best presentation on the gold standard money can buy	This is book is beautiful in its simplicity. Rothbard first presents accurately what has historically happened when money is left up to the government. The important thing to remember is that Rothbard just doesn't make stuff up, he uses history to portray why the gold standard (and really, a privatized system of currency) is necessary for maximum freedom.<br />Even if you're not a Libertarian or an economist, you will appreciate Rothbard's perspective on the money you use everyday. Agree or disagree, this book is great.	2003-04-24

He talks about his many battles with editors and his long struggle before he made it in the writing field. However, he barely mentions the art of writing. Really, his only advice is to use simple language, and to keep to a minimum number of words. Those are just basics to writing.<br />His philosophy towards writing is you need to be a bad writer for a while before you become a decent one, which is true, but there are ways to make one's writing better.<br />However, Mr. Sowell's personal history, his humor, and his criteria for citing sources makes this worth the price of admission. But keep other expectations low, and remember that this book is only about 20 pages.	2003-04-23

I didn't read this book by choice; I got stuck with Paul Erdos as a school project for my High School algebra class. Needless to say, I wasn't all that enthused. However, this book presented so well and so entertainingly this math genius that I'd recommend it to anyone. We learn about the inner world of math geniuses, the lines of progress that have been made in the twentieth century, and the problem solving process itself.<br />Paul Erdos in presented in perfect form, this book is what biographies should be. His relationship with his family, women, peers, and young people are all apparent. His quirks and his genius for numbers. We also get to see the effects of the Cold War political climate in the world on intelligentsia. On top of all that, you even get a little math too.	2003-04-23

It's a convenient size for hiking trips, or just to carry around if you live in the region. But it's also small enough to lose in a pile of matches. It's slightly informative, you must remember that not a lot is actually known about the meaning of the rock symbols, and this volume is not the defining one when it comes to the intricacies of reading rock symbols. It is enough to get the basics down. There are better works out there for the serious enthusiast, but if you're just trying to enjoy a vacation more, then yeah, get this and throw it in your pocket.	2003-04-22

Savage writes with an almost minimalist attitude that makes for quick reading. It also makes him relatively easy to understand. In a world where there are lots of political writers who waver on the incomprehensible, Savage is unmistakably clear.  But there are a few areas a potential reader should note.<br />Firstly, Savage goes through this book with no cited sources, no references, etc. This is a little annoying, and this takes away from the validity of much of what Mr. Savage writes about. He has a PhD, he should no how to cite a source. Further, in this volume we get a lot of controversial \\"fact\\" that if true shoots very large holes in the philosophy of liberalism. But no sources. I guess you have to read other scholarly conservatives to get useful information.<br />Secondly, though the flow of the book is great, everything goes together well, there lacks a lot of depth. The reader is left wanting when it comes to the importance of language, culture and borders. It is in this light that the work can be looked at as a long rant.<br />However, Savage presents the essentials of his arguments, and we understand basically where he is coming from and what he means to say. After reading this you can listen to his talk show with a little more understanding. There is a debate brewing even among conservatives, the more libertarian conservatives opposing many of the strong armed views of Michael Savage. This book is on the cutting edge of the coming debate, and important for that fact alone.	2003-04-22

We get a bad rap, which is fine, but then again, we're not old, so we don't really care. However, in this book everyone can get and enjoy a dose of worldly wisdom from Steve Smith, the head honcho from the Public Television show \\"The Red Green Show.\\" <br />I admit, I almost didn't give this book five stars. At times the jokes are stale, and the various essays can sometimes be short. However, the total entertainment value is maintained. And really, aren't old people supposed to have stale jokes? ;-)<br />Sarcasm aside, Steve Smith has a sharp mind and makes great points about getting older. And in a way it helps show us young people that getting old is not something we can dodge, but that it can be done with optimism. Get it, read it, share it.	2003-04-22

The volume is too short to support more than a cursory amount of information on the many martial and combative arts that are Olympic events. Not to say it isn't a nice volume to carry around if you happen to attend one of these Olympic events and have no idea what's going on, but then again, why would you go to an event you know nothing about? Sure, it is a good little book to give to the kids while they are watching some Olympic event, but you can find better guides online. Save your money for something else.	2003-04-22

Paul Harvey has been doing radio a long time, so that should leave more stories available for use. Not that the ones included were bad, they were hilarious.<br />This book takes about an afternoon to read, and you will continually go back to it.  Many of Paul Harvey's stories are on the internet in the form of forwards, but Harvey is not mentioned in them. Here is where you can find most of them. <br />I would even rate this book as more readable than other news of the weird type columns. <br />A more extensive collection would be great, but alas, we are left with this. Fortunately, we can still listen to Paul Harvey on the radio.  His \\"For What it's Worth\\" section will never grow stale.	2003-04-21

In this book you get the story of Rich Beem [before he won a major] and his caddy Steve Duplantis.  This has to be the most entertaining story Ive seen in a long time, and its all true.  We see the Rich Beem, former cell phone salesman and well-traveled golfer, shoot for his dream.  In his quest he finds a companion in the form of Steve Duplantis, a love torn caddy that has problems in his personal life.<br />This is a great book first and foremost because it is superbly written.  Alan Shipnuck has a relaxed and well-organized structure to his writing.  Shipnuck, who writes for Sports Illustrated, took a gamble on writing this book, at the time Rich Beem hadnt won a major, and stories of colorful, yet still second rate professional golfers dont float amongst the bestseller lists all that often.<br />At a PG-13 level we see Rich and Steve live their lives in tour, under the microscope, and learn about events that neither would be proud of.  Theres an intimacy here you dont normally get in biographies. Rich wins a PGA tour event in his rookie year on the tour, Steve Duplantis has a good job with Rich, but do they hold it together for an entire season? The book will leave you interested in finding out more about Beem and Co. Maybe a sequel Mr. Shipnuck?<br />Its a need to read for those interested in golf, and its an quick and entertaining story for those who really dont care about golf.	2003-04-21
