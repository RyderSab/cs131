Then a friend started having a sleep disorder that was really ruining his life. He went to one sleep specialist who put him on a medication for which even the pharmacist thought she had prescribed an awfully large dosage, and it didn't help that much, so she sent him to another specialist, who recommended a light box in the morning. He bought the thing, but thought it was kind of nutty, and after I set it up for him I came home and looked in this book and found a whole section explaining various forms of sleep disorder, with three or four possible explanations for his, including why and how the light box might work. I also realized that he and his wife do not close the blinds in their bedroom, which is a factor I don't think they ever considered. So I am buying a second copy of the book for them.  What doctors fail to do, so often, is explain why they are doing something -- or explain it skimpily, or you can't take in what they do say because you are hearing new information that sounds weird...whatever, I know the explanations in this book are going to be useful to my friend, and now I will look through the other sections to see what else is there. Thank you, Smolensky and Lamberg.	2004-12-11

Books for Youth (Awards))	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Compelling narrative, good history	<br />If you've loved Warren's earlier books about children surviving in difficult new circumstances  (the two Orphan trains books, Surviving Hitler, and the one about the girl growing up on the prairie) you'll love this one, too. In this one, Long, the young hero, is half Vietnamese, half American. His survival depends on a pivotal airlift of Vietnamese orphans \\"tainted by the blood of the enemy\\" as the North Vietnamese are about to take over Saigon.  But even before that the reader is caught up in the story of Long's mother and grandmother struggling to survive in a wartorn country.  <br /> <br />The story works on one level for children and on another for adults -conveying how America's withdrawal from Vietnam affects the family of a boy whose young life is shaped by war. It has all the virtues of nonfiction wrapped up in a charming, moving, and compelling story. Adults and children may want to read this one together. It's a tribute to parenting, in whatever form it comes, and to the resilience of children.  <br />	2004-10-20

For example, Tessina suggests discussing adult topics with your adult child, not just family topics or questions about their personal life.  Or if your adult child says or does something annoying, treat it just as casually as you would if it were someone else's adult kid saying something annoying (ignore it and don't let yourself be drawn into a family squabble).<br />Here is a quotation starting a chapter that catches the flavor of the book: &quot;What we must keep remembering is that our bodies respond to the feminine principle, the goddess. They respond to rest, to nurturing, to a presence that says you are okay just the way you are.&quot; -- quoting Dr. Christiane Northrup	2001-05-02

Books	5	22	26	N	N	A wonderful story of how science is done	As a gardener, I love the story of a monk who loves gardening founding the  science of genetics -- and it's a good story. As a mother and sometimes  teacher, I love the fact that Mendel was a lousy test-taker and didn't do  well in school as a result -- and still became the founder of genetics.(He  became a monk to get an education, as I recall--or was it to do his plant  breeding work? I don't remember that detail.) At a time when  overachievement is a sickness, this tale of a man who loves his numbers  becoming obsessed about patterns in pea reproduction stumbling on the  secret to a whole modern industry is tonic. And the whole second half of  the book, which is the story about how his discoveries were lost and found  and became the center of a story of science politics, are simply  fascinating.     I am a little puzzled at the reader who complained there  was no original research. You don't even have to read the book to know the  author went to Brno. On C-Span Books the author explained about how when  she was at the monastery in Brno she learned about the &quot;secret&quot;  door in the monastery's formal library and went through to the room in back  where the monks actually studied and did their work -- and how it was from  that window that they probably shouted out to Mendel in his garden, thereby  explaining one piece of the puzzle about why people thought he fudged his  numbers and why he probably didn't.        Far more interesting to me, in  some ways, was realizing that this was a time when religion supported  science and science was something the average gardener could get involved  in and would then talk about in a local talk -- in the days before people  were glued to their tv sets -- when science and religion weren't seen as  adversaries, as they appear to be in Kansas.       A good read.	2000-08-07

In  the section about a 1950s LSD experiment in which the CIA secretly  administered LSD  to scientist Frank Olson (who didn't know what was  happening and subsequently &quot;jumped&quot; to his death from a New York  hotel),  this reads like a true-crime book -- with the world of military  science as the backdrop and people like  Sidney Gottlieb as the  bad guys.   As an overview of complex issues, this is easy to follow precisely because  it is presented as excellent  storytelling. Bottom line, according to  Regis: although the U.S., U.K., Canada,, and Japan have stockpiled   biological agents and toxins,  so far there has been no serious biological  warfare -- because  biological weapons lack &quot;the single most important  ingredient of any effective weapon, an immediate visual display of  overwhelming power and brute strength.&quot;	1999-12-08

It made me curious about parts of Georgetown that are certainly different now from the 1920s and  earlier but the novel doesn't flow as a novel: one chapter doesn't lead to  the next, there are no character transitions, etc.  In one chapter Pearl is  sticking her tongue out at Johnnie Mae and they're not getting along and in  the next chapter they're best friends and appear to have been so for years.   Plot lines appear but are never developed.  There is a little friction  between the mother and father which is never resolved (fictionally), and  Johnnie Mae's Indian heritage is mentioned enough that you expect something  to be made of it, but it's not.  The social studies aspects of it are  interesting and this might be good for classroom (social studies) reading  but it falls short in terms of the plot and character development working  together.  I finished it only because our book group decided to try it. And  now I'm sorry we are reading it as I don't even think it will good for a  discussion. What I don't understand is why this was an Oprah Pick. Oprah's  endorsement has now lost a lot of credibility with me.	1999-12-07

There, in several brilliantly clear paragraphs, Gene  and Katie Hamilton told me exactly how to fix my machine using a little  gadget that came with the machine that I would never have known had a  purpose -- without electrocuting myself or cutting off my fingers. There is  nothing more thrilling than fixing something you never thought you could  fix yourself. (Here's a situation where the word &quot;empowerment&quot;  really means something.) When I think of the times I have paid a plumber a  small fortune for a minor fix like this that I could, with the right  instructions, have fixed myself...I wish I'd had this book sooner!

I've been listening to the unabridged 10-tape version of the novel and am astonished at how  the movie's focus (all that I was familiar with before) comes from the tenth  tape -- up till then it's a comic novel about Aurora and her suitors! This  is the ideal novel to assign for a film-writing class. Maybe it's a  tear-jerker, and maybe the movie is about a tough mother-daughter  relationship, but that's not what I heard on the audiotape. The accents on  the audiotape also didn't match my memory of the movie. Lots of Dolly  Parton type voices (which was entertaining) and the General sounds more  like George C. Scott than like Jack Nicholson). Kind of like listening to a  different movie to listen to the audiotape, and a very enjoyable  experience.

Quite a few of the 18 or so people present hadn't  finished the book and many didn't plan to. The opening third of the book is tough, because the characters are not well  realized at first, their names sound alike, the author's stance is ironic  so it's hard to sympathize with anyone (this book sure isn't going to send  people touring in India).  I am still not sure why some of the exposition  about characters' earlier lives doesn't come earlier in the novel where it  would help you understand them.  Whether the novel is good enough to  deserve all the effort you have to put in to understand it -- whether most  readers will  have faith that the story will pick up in pace (which it does  somewhere around page 200)  -- I don't know. I wouldn't recommend it to  most of my friends.  And we had mixed but often negative reactions in our  book group.  The author creates some vivid images and scenes, and as one  member pointed out, it's interesting that the mother comes across as fairly  awful as viewed from the perspective of her children's unmet needs as small  children -- but as rather more  wonderful when viewed as a fellow adult (in  the final flashbacks) in an impossible love relationship that crosses the  color line. I am not  sorry I read the book, and after our discussion some members of our book  group said they may finish reading the book.  I thought some of the  language tricks were too cute and  I found many things about the novel  annoying, but in the end I am glad I read it.	1999-06-03

As I read passages  in this anthology, my mixed feelings began to come into focus....Read  straight through, DYING: A BOOK OF COMFORT was a spiritual experience for  me. Some chapters let me look at dying from my father's perspective. Other  chapters simply gave me the perspective of people who have been through  this before me and my family. Pat McNees's collection contains carefully  selected and ordered pieces--poems, prayers, prose, and fictin. The  anthology explores a range of experiences: living when you know you are  dying; caring for and about someone who is dying; saying goodbye; and  dealing with how it feels to be left behind.  Read straight through, the  book's structure allows the reader to move through the process of dying and  grieving in an arc, starting with &quot;Illness as Awakening.&quot;  Following chapters examine how people who are dying, as well as their loved  ones, experience the process of dying and saying goodbye. The apex of the  arc is death itself, with chapters including views on immortality and  prayer. The book then moves into &quot;The Journey Through Grief.&quot;   What follows are chapters devoted to mourning the loss of a child, parent,  or spouse, to grieving a sudden death or suicide. The closing chapters have  their focus on death's aftermath--the remembering, for example, or the  other ways we deal with the ongoingness of this greatest of all losses.      Beyond being a personal comfort to me, I found the book to be an excellent  resource. I'm often at a loss for words when talking with or writing to  someone who is grieving.  In its passages I have found just the right  passage to share with friends of mine who have lost a mother, a husband, a  son.      While McNees didn't set out to write a spiritual book, she has  created a volume that speaks to the heart. Written after her father's  death, this project was designed to help people get through the process of  death and grieving. Dame Cicely Saunders, found of Hospice, says of Pat's  book, &quot;This remarkable collection, coming from personal experience and  wide reading, will help many find the potential of growth through  loss.&quot;     DYING; A BOOK OF COMFORT would make a thoughtful gift for a  family or individual coping with terminal illness, someone who is grieving,  or people who work with the dying or bereaved. My copy has already become  dog-eared and annotated, as it travels with me to visit my father. Thanks,  Pat, for the words of comfort. (Eileen Hanning)	1999-01-27
