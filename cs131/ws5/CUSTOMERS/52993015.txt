US	52993015	R1GDI00SG1UZIL	1400030552	115531022	In a Free State: A Novel	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Very well written, somewhat slow.	This book is made up of a short Prologue and Epilogue, and three short stories, the last of which, called \\"In A Free State,\\" taking more than half of the pages. <br />This first story is the best. It is a fictionalization of a Uganda-like state whose Idi Amin-like despot president takes over the country, seen through the eyes of two white English folk who are driving across the country in an afternoon. This story builds suspense well and the \\"reward\\" of a little bit of action toward the end. <br />The first story is interesting as well, about an Indian man trying to make it in the US. However, the second, \\"Tell Me Who To Kill\\" is the weakest, despite the intriguing title. It seems to have very little point aside from what Naipaul has done in the past, and his great writing skills are ripped to shreds because the story is written in a simple dialect. I would recommend reading this book, skipping or quickly skimming the second story. If it had been taken out I would have probably given the book an extra star.	2003-09-05

The thing I like about this story is it forces the reader to examine what makes a man good vs. what makes a man evil. Schindler starts the novel as a brilliant but self-serving war profiteer, exploiting his jewish workers in some of the same ways as the Nazi Party starts out doing. However, Schindler sees a few things that start him on the course to becoming a modern-day saviour, the most impressive image being the brutal killing of a little jewish girl whose beautiful red dress he had admired from across the ghetto. <br />The book is filled with shocking imagery such as this, which make it all the more moving, but not recommended for the faint-of-heart. There were many passages I read, after which I could feel my stomach turning.<br />Oskar Schindler saw all this first-hand, and you feel as if you do as well when reading this book. Schindler risked his life throughout the entire war to save thousands of jews who were completely dependent on him. The whole time he was also competing with an SS Captain who probably killed, on any whim, ten Jews for every one life that Schindler saved.<br />I would highly recommend this book, despite the fact that there are thousands of holocaust books on the market. This one transcends the setting.	2003-09-05

This book tell the amazing story of the rise and fall of the incredibly successful cocaine kingpin and terrorist Pablo Escobar, who became one of the richest billionaires in the world and held the entire country of Colombia hostage for years, while continually a thorn in the side of the US. It raises many moral questions about whether the ends justifies the means in covert US military operations. It is amazing to see the exact toll the drug trade has taken on Colombia and the United States in ways that most people don't realize.	2003-03-03

It seems to characterize the spirit oif the Booker Prize, because it is a fine analysis of English culture in an age of transition from the traditional class-based, industry-fueled age of the British, to building the modern Britain after the jolt of World War II. It humanizes the character of the butler, who has in the past been used as a stereotype of tradional British culture, like Wodehouse's Jeeves, with his stiff-upper lip. The story is fascinating and the psychological conflict is subtle but powerful.	2002-08-14

The author challenges the reader to accept these highly flawed characters for what they are, while entertaining with creative, darkly funny analogies of the common man's condition. <BR>The reason this book is already a classic is it encapsulates the feelings of those left behind by the rise of a new age and century, using modern language and colorful humor.	2002-06-07

If I hadn't already read Girlfriend 44 by the same author while in Scotland, I might have been turned off by the title of the book (although it does get your attention). However, the sinister premise is a set-up for an avalanche of conflict and wild situations described by hilarious banter from the main character. He is not really a bad guy, he just does a bad thing and suffers throughout the book for it. The result is a wild, off-the-wall second novel, a more fast-paced and direct improvement over Girlfriend 44, which I also enjoyed. It was amazing to me that Barrowcliffe resolved the main character's messes so cleanly in the end! I am looking forward to his next.	2002-06-02

How?\\" It won for a reason: it is a fresh account of the much discussed World War II Holocaust, told from a single (real) person's point of view. The main character (Art Spiegelman's father) is Jewish, and so is represented by a mouse. Nazis are cats. The mouse (barely) survives a sentence in a concentration camp. The fact that the book is in comic format with personified animals allows you to absorb the story and it's gruesome details quickly and painlessly until you understand the magnitude and reality of it. Then you are overwhelmed, and the book explodes into powerful work of human experience.	2002-05-19

I can't really imagine this one being made into a movie, although it likely will be. Starts out funny, but becomes somewhat preachy and misses its mark. The characters aren't quite as believeable as Hornby's other ones, likely because he is trying to write from a woman's viewpoint and is out of his element. Read this one after you have loved all of Hornby's other novels and be mildly entertained but somewhat disappointed.	2002-05-15

It kept me entertained during the trip back. Not as dry as most British Humor, but filled with amusing anecdotes and interesting comedy about being a bachelor with a strong sex drive. The plot surprises at times and is an adequate vehicle for the in-your-face humor. Don't expect a masterpiece of modern literature, but read it if you laugh at the articles in Maxim and FHM. This is a fun one, and reads quickly despite its heft.	2002-05-15

Reilly is a lot like the Comic Book Shop Guy, and I think they are both hilarious. This is a book everyone should read. I know a several people who are a lot like Reilly, which makes the book both funny and depressing; realistic and absurd. A literary classic because it encapsulates our American Society into a story. Amazingly enough, it is more relavent now than it was then. Some people would say that it has been overrated which might be slightly true, but the bottom line is it is a damn fine novel and a classic. It deserves at least one read.	2002-05-15

You will laugh, but you will be reminded of a million other plot lines if you don't live in a cave. Which is precisely the point. If you are a Dave Barry fan, it is cool to see how he tackles writing a novel, which is almost exactly as you'd expect: a funny novel with a lot of insane characters and a chaotic and satirical plot. I'd give it a B-.	2002-05-15

Says a lot about the modern non-nuclear family, maturity, and machismo. Although Hornby's latest, _How To Be Good_ is not bad, this one is much better. I just hope the movie and Hugh Grant do justice to the book.	2002-05-15

After about the third chapter, this book completely disintegrates into a  whole lot of silly, &quot;what's the point?&quot; stories.  He does not  offer convincing proof that to be a Christian means to never date, and he  certainly does a poor job of backing up his beliefs with the Bible.  I am a  serious Christian and I know that dating is absolutely okay, especially  after reading this book.	1998-10-26
