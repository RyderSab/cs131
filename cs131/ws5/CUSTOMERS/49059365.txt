US	49059365	R2Z09L3NSZOF3Y	0553587382	704948528	Terminal	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Average book redeemed by an incredible ending	While reading Terminal, I couldn't help but wonder what Brian Keene was trying to do with this story. Terminal reads like a cheap cross between Stephen King's Rage and The Green Mile. But the book never comes close to reaching the thrills and chills these other novels offered to the reader. In fact, were it not for the ending, the book itself would have been somewhat of a bore, a recycled series of event we've seen many times before.  <br /> <br />And that's too bad, because Keene is a very good writer. His stories usually hit very hard, thrilling the reader until the very last page. But there is very little excitement to be found in this heist story. When Tommy learns that he has cancer and only has a month or so left in this world, he decides that he needs to do something to provide a good future for his wife and son. But it'll be hard giving them what they need since he's also just been layed off from his job. <br /> <br />That's when he has the brilliant idea to rob a bank. His friends John and Sherm decide to help, being the good buddies that they are. But of course, the robbery goes wrong. People are killed and Sherm becomes a killing machine thirsty for blood (Rage anyone?) <br /> <br />Its during the hostage situation that Tommy meets Benjy, a young boy who might or might not have the power to heal the dying by placing his hands on them (The Green Mile anyone?). But Tommy must have faith in his future and in this boy before being saved. <br /> <br />Keene's writing, as always, is tight and consice. It's too bad he  couldn't apply his style to a better story. The characters seem dated, quoting Slim Shady (Emminem has not called himself that in a long time) and other rap songs that were popular six or seven years ago. And the characters themselves and underdevelopped and barely likeable. Even the hostages are stereotypical cardboard cutouts that won't inspire any sympathy for their situation from the reader. <br /> <br />I was about to give up on the novel until the last 50 pages came along. That's when the story finally picks up and stops being redundant. Instead of long long long passages where our main character complains about his life and what is happening to him and blames everyone in the world for his situation (I mean really, if there is one person to blame for the people who died during the robbery, it's Tommy even if he didn't murder them himself), the book becomes a breathless ride filled with action, the thing Keene writes best.  <br /> <br />Keene is a good author capable of much better. I'm just waiting for his masterpiece to fall on my lap. Hopefully, his next one will be just that.	2005-10-08
US	49059365	RXIAHM3ERUP17	0517122707	161411385	A Confederacy of Dunces	Books	3	2	7	N	N	New Orleans Remembered	After my visit to the great city of New Orleans just a week before the devastation left by Katrina, I decided to read this award-winning novel that is set in New Orleans. And it's true that this novel has the city at heart. As a matter of fact, the city itself becomes somewhat of a character in Toole's novel. But in the end, I can't fully admit to having loved this book. <br /> <br />And this is mostly due to the story's main character. Ignatious is a large, very loud, very opinionated man that can never find the errors in his ways. His life is nothing but a sham, and his mind is a ludicrous fried mess. Being well in his thirties, he still lives with his mother, does not have a job and refuses to take ahold of his life. <br /> <br />No wonder he is giving his mother headaches. Ignatius is just a big bag of problems. So after his mother has a car accident due to his carelessness, she decides that he needs to find a job in order to help pay for the damages. Reluctantly, Ignatius agrees. As we follow him from job to job, the character becomes more and more ridiculous, more and more irresponsible. <br /> <br />Ignatius got on my nerves, plain and simple. Although some moments had me smiling, I rolled my eyes more often than anything else. These characters are clueless, desperate and very, very emotionally empty. I like a little more substance and three-dimentional characters when I read a book. And the ending itself is much too evasive; nothing is really resolved, nothing is explained, nothing is settled. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the novel for taking me back to New Orleans, albeit in the 1960s. In here, we find great pleasure in following these characters around the great city.  <br /> <br />In the end, this somewhat comic novel simply didn't do it for me. Although I could appreciate some of it, a greater part of it left me feeling a little bitter.	2005-09-15
US	49059365	R1OF8VCUE5ZRG7	0312312601	492178681	Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Memoirs of a B-movie Star	Bruce Campbell is no stranger to genre fans. After all, he was the star of the Evil Dead trilogy (some of the best, scariest movies ever made) and he has more than enough bad direct-to-video movies under his belt to shame any B-movie actor. Yet Bruce Campbell's fan base grows larger every year, just as his chins seems to get bigger and bigger. <br /> <br />This time around, Campbell decided to write a small piece of fan ficiton with himself at the heart of it all. What would happen if Campbell, a B-movie actor, was cast in a Hollywood romantic comedy starring Richard Gere, Renne Zellewegger, Elizabeth Taylor and directed by Mike Nichols? Well, let's just say that the result, according to Campbell, would not be pretty. <br /> <br />His first faux-pas is to ask everyone else on the production to call him solely by his character name, Foyle. His second mistake is trying to find and write a back story for his character (giving him the worse one possible). And his very worst mistake? Well, he actually starts giving advice. To everyone. Soon enough, the curse of the B-movie actor hits and the production is cursed to be doomed and a major failure. And of course, Campbell is blamed for it all. <br /> <br />Campbell knows a lot about Hollywood and so, as over the top as this material is, a great deal of it is surprisingly believeable.  Some sections of this book, as when Campbell goes to Gere's to give him acting lessons, or when Campbell shows up for Renee's costume fitting, are flat out funny. It takes a lot for a book to make me laugh out loud, and this one did it. <br /> <br />On the other end, the joke runs for a bit too long. In the end, it gets a bit repetitive and tedious. The over-the-top ending takes it one bit too far, but the book's final moments makes up for it.  <br /> <br />Although not as great as If Chins Could Kill, Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way is recommended material for fans of the actor and for anyone who needs a good healthy laugh. Another winner by the great almighty Bruce Campbell.	2005-08-08
US	49059365	R13HJTEUQMFU6X	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Vampire Lit To Sink Your Teeth Into	Many things have already been said about The Historian. But the biggest wrong of all is to compare this novel to The Da Vinci Code. While Code is a poorly written and barely exciting novel that never seems to end (and poorly researched), The Historian is brilliantly researched and spans many centuries to offer the first true vampire literary novel since Interview With The Vampire. <br /> <br />The fact that this novel comes from a first time author feels like a small miracle in itself. From its very first pages, with a letter that begins with the words ' My dear and unfortunate successor', we are propelled into an intelligent narrative full of wonder and excitement. <br /> <br />When a 16 year old girl finds this letter in her father's study, she never fathoms that this letter would forever change her world - past, present and future. In fact, this letter is directly linked to Vlad the Impaler, also known in modern literature as Dracula thanks to Bram Stoker's brilliant 19th Century novel. As a matter of fact, it seems that Dracula - son of the Dragon - is still alive and well. Her father, Paul, has been on his tail for decades and now that he has disappeared, she is obliged to try and find a way to join her father in his search. <br /> <br />This is the kind of novel that has a story within a story within a story. As she hears then reads her father's account of how he discovered Dracula's existence, she also puts her hands on old letters and different pieces of literature that explains the dark one's existence. Through her search, she will find out about her mother's true identity and about the dark one's past and history. <br /> <br />This is a novel that brings you a lot of history without ever being a bore. It's brilliantly written, yet never pretentious. Although it is over 600 pages long, it never feels like a long, tedious book you have to work overtime to understand or enjoy.  <br /> <br />Some people have complained that Bram Stoker's Dracula is never usedas fully as it should during the course of the narrative, but that's exactly why I found this book so wonderfully fascinating. Stoker's Dracula was an entity of its own. This new Dracula is both fascinating and terrifying, the source of nightmares and awe.  <br /> <br />The Historian might very well be this year's most entertaining and enjoyable literary novel. It has a great blend of horror, romance and suspense you won't soon forget.	2005-08-02

Finally, here's an author who's not afraid to write it like it is. There are many different brands of horror, and Keene tends to be more visceral without every turning the reader off. His stories are brutal but never unbearable for the reader.  <br /> <br />City of the Dead picks up exactly where Keene's previous zombie effort, The Rising, left off. And from the very first page, you embark on a thrill ride that never comes to a full stops. Twists after twists, chills after chills, no one's safe in this story. <br /> <br />Jim finds his son and, with Martin his Preacher friend and Frankie, an ex-junkie, they decide to make a run for it, hoping to find a place where they'll be safe from the zombies roaming the earth. Now that he is reunited with his son Danny, Jim has a purpose. He will do anything in his power to save Danny from the evils of Ob, the lead Zombie. <br /> <br />Soon enough, they end up at the Ramsey Towers, a community of humans living in a tower in the heart of New York City. The tower is owned by an eccentric and disturbed man who's sanity is quickly fading. It's only a matter of time before the zombies find a way in. And once they do, cahos ensues, which leads you to a very surprising, touching and incredible ending.  <br /> <br />Animals, humans, birds... Everything can turn into a zombie in Keene's Universe. The suspense mounts, the action is nonstop and the thrills never cease. It's like being on a roller coaster ride that never stops. Keene's characters are vivid and, if you have read the previous installment, you come to see them as friends. <br /> <br />The fact that the plot resembles slightly George Romero's recent movie Land of the Dead is a simple coincidence. But this book has characters you can root for and more action than should be legal in a book this size. I can't wait to read Keene's next book and I'm sure you'll feel the same after reading City of the Dead, one of the best zombie stories you will find on the shelves of your local bookstore.	2005-07-24
US	49059365	R2KR8K30QUT4UI	0743270193	350468202	Nocturnes	Books	3	18	20	N	N	The Shorts of Horror	Some authors are made to write short stories, a tighter, shorter format that needs to be told with little expense. Others are made to write longer narratives. John Connolly is one of these authors. His novels (starring PI Charlie Parker) are always a great mix of suspense and the paranormal. The books take you places you've never been before and are written with wit, humour and great style. Unfortunately, the same cannot be applied to Connolly's first collection of short stories. <br /> <br />It comes as no surprise then that the two best pieces in this collection are also the longest one. The Cancer Cowboy Rides is an AMAZING tale of suspense and terror that will leave you biting your nails (One of the best pieces of terror I've read in a while). And The Reflecting Eye : A Charlie Parker Story showcases the author's talent when it comes to blending horror and suspense. The tale is fast-paced, gritty and highly entertaining. <br /> <br />The rest of this collection has its ups and downs. The problem with Connolly's stories is that they are all very predictable and typical. There are no real surprises in these short tales of suspense and terror. The reader isn't left with much to play with.  <br /> <br />Yet, there are a few stories worth mentioning. The Erlking takes childhood fears to the very next level. The Underbury Witches (another longer piece) is fun yet a bit too predictable for its own good. And The Shifting in the Sands has a good premise but it is downplayed by a so-so ending. <br /> <br />I am a big fan of Connolly's work, but some author's just aren't made for the short story format. And yet, this collection had me going. I can't wait to read Connolly's newest thriller. I know that I'll be in for a good ride. As it is, Nocturnes is a decent collection with a couple of great pieces and many forgettable ones.	2005-06-28
US	49059365	R3U4LKHHHX2LE	0843954108	162100113	The Abandoned	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Nightmare on Clegg Street	Dreams have often been an obssession for horror authors. After all, in dreams we find nightmares. Clegg, in his new and probably last Harrow story, deals with dreams and nightmare, and with unbeliveable terrors. This is not the typical Clegg book. It is more violent, more action-oriented and less complicated plot-wise. And I have to admit that I had troubles with the book at first, but as I read along, I suddenly realised that the story had been able to steal me away and terrify me. <br /> <br />Welcome to Watch Point, the small town that has already appeared in previous Clegg novels. It is in Watch Point that we find Harrow, the haunted mansion that starred in The Infinite, Mischief and Nightmare House. Only this time, Harrow wants revenge. It wants to be alive and it will take every life it needs in order to do so. <br /> <br />Soon enough, Watch Point becomes a source of terror. Everyone, it seems, is either turning insane or caught in a very deep sleep. Only a few unlucky souls are spared to witness the terrors all around them. Young children kill adults, animals become wild and violent beasts, and neighbours that had once been friendly are now feeling a thirst for death and murder. Everyone seems to be in a daze as the house controls their every action, and the few survivors are left to witness the horrors created by the people they once knew. Can you imagine killing your brother or sister? This is the kind of plot twist this novel offers. <br /> <br />When you pick up a Clegg novel, you just know that it will be well written and that the suspense will build towards an amazing finale. And on those points, The Abandoned does not disappoint. But the book's biggest flaw is that in never really gives us characters to care for. The book is close to 400 pages long, and it's first half is used to describe the mayhem and violence taking place in Watch Point. By the time you know who the story's heroes are, it's a bit late to really care for them. Although you still want to know what happens next, this isn't a book about characters. It's all about suspense and terror. And there was this one character that had hero potential, but he is discarded much too quickly.  <br /> <br />Like Stephen King's Needful Things, this is one book that dares to take a city and completely destroy it within the span of its narrative. Some moments are shocking and nearly unpredictable. But during those moments, I would have liked someone to root for. You have to hand it to Clegg though, cause he knows how to deliver the chills. <br /> <br />The last 150 pages is a real roller coaster ride that you won't want to get off of. Although this isn't one of Clegg's best, it's still a very decent entry in his body of work.	2005-06-06

Connelly's Bosch stories are always entertaining and full of mysteries, twists and turns and great plota. But The Closers serves as a great reminder of Bosch's greatness to any fan. Because The Closers is probably one of the author's best books.  <br /> <br />Continuing where The Narrows left off, Bosch is now back with the LAPD, working old cases that have been left unresolved. He teams up with Kiz Rider, his old partner, and their first assingment is the seventeen year old murder of a young high school girl who's body was found dead in the Hollywood hills.  <br /> <br />Soon enough, Bosch sees that the original investigators left too many doors open for them. In fact, through the murder book, Bosch quickly uncovers the many mistakes that were made when the case was first investigated. Only this time, they have one thing going for them; DNA on the weapon.  <br /> <br />This trace brings them to a man name Mackey, who, seventeen years ago, was involved in racist hate crimes. Is the black girl's murder related to Mackey, or is all of it just a strange coincidence? Bosch will go through great lengths to solve this case. It almost becomes personal to him, as he has to prove himself once again to anyone who doubt his reinstatement in the precinct.  <br /> <br />Bosch is back in top form. Some might even say that he's a little too good in this one. Within the span of a single day, Bosch uncovers more than the original investigators did during their whole search. But that's Bosch for you. This is the only thing I have to reproach the book. That aside, The Closer is full of suspense, has great dialogue, witty writing and you never know where Connelly will take you next. For once, I wasn't able to predict the ending. And for that, I need to thank Connelly. <br /> <br />I can't wait for the next Bosch book. Usually, after a while, I grow tired of an author's style. Their books startto feel repetitive after the fifth or seventh one. But that hasn't happened yet with Connelly, and The Closers only reinforced the idea that Connelly is today's best mystery writer.	2005-05-30
US	49059365	R2VJIP79MRBCD2	0843952164	746862069	Peaceable Kingdom	Books	4	2	3	N	N	An author in top form	Short stories aren't as popular as they used to be. In fact, the short story has become an endangered species. People aren't interested in the shorter form anymore. Just look at the books lining the shelves at your local bookstore; it seems that people want bricks instead of more compact stories. <br /> <br />The horror genre has always found a place for the shorter format. Some writers have excelled at it; Stephen King, Douglas Clegg, Lucy Taylor... And Jack Ketchum. Ketchum should be a name familiar to any hardcore horror fan. After all, he's the man who brought us the vicious, disturbing Girl Next Door and Off Season and the wonderfully quiet horror tale Red. Peaceable Kingdom brings most of his short stories together for the reader's own pleasure. <br /> <br />And what a pleasure it is. This collection proves that Ketchum is an amazing talent. The tome collects hardcore horror tales, suspense stories, more dramatic fare, sci-fi based sotries... There's something for everyone in here. <br /> <br />Trying to point out one story over another is almost impossible. There isn't one dud in this collection. But some stories are more memorable than others; The Box and The Rifle are two of Ketchum's most known shorts, but they are also his best. Both stories are able to find horror in the ordinary and disturb reader with their realism. But more titles should be added to that list; The Haunt, Father and Son, Twins, Closing Time, Snakes, The Visitor, Exit at Toledo Blade Boulevard and especially Forever. That last story is so emotionally powerful and the ending is so shocking that it will leave you longing for more. <br /> <br />Ketchum is without a doubt the best horror writer out there after King himself. No one has been able to deliver the goods like Ketchum does. Everything he writes is worth reading, every story of his is a little masterpiece of horror. If you haven't yet discovered Ketchum, this is the best place to start. And if you have already discovered him, thisis the must-own collection that will leave you craving for more.	2005-05-22

Peter Moore Smith left his mark on suspense fiction when he published the intricate and amazing Raveling which is, to this day, one of my favorite mystery novel. Smith is finally back with Los Angeles, another suspense novel about the workings of the human mind and of the human condition. Smith isn't a writer who can be solely satisfied with great plots; he needs great, complicated characters to boot. And that's why the author is quickly becoming one of the freshest new voices in mystery fiction. <br /> <br />Angel's life isn't what you could call ordinary. His father is a big Hollywood producer, his mother is a strange, transparent woman and Angel himself... well, there's nothing normal about Angel. First off, Angel's an albino with a social disorder. Oh, and he's addicted to the film Blade Runner. He lives his life in solitude with his nose burried in books, going out only at night and only when completely necessary. <br /> <br />But Angel is still human, and when he meets his new neighbour Angela, a stripper with striking eyes that change color, he's immediately attracted to her. Unfortunately, their romance isn't given much time to grow because one night, Angel receives a phone call where Angela whispers his name. The connection is cut, and Angel knows that something has happened to her.  <br /> <br />Forgetting all about his medication, Angel goes on a hunt to find the love of his life. But what he uncovers will forever shatter his existence. Life, as he knows it, is nothing but a mere illusion that will soon shatter in a million little pieces. <br /> <br />Los Angeles is full of twists and turns, many of them completely unpredictable. Written in the first person, the author finds a brilliant voice to tell his story in. Not only is Angel a flawed and vivid character, he's also full of mysteries that are being kept from the readers.  <br /> <br />Once you start this one, you will not want to put it down. Los Angeles is a great mystery thriller that succeeds at being different from the lot of generic mysteries out there. The author's purpose never falters. The many twists are not simple ploys to shock the reader; they help sustain that sense of paranoia that courses through the narrative. Los Angeles is a great thriller that deserves all the recognition it will receive.	2005-05-09

During the late 90s, early 00s, his books were, quite frankly, boring. They repeated old stories he'd written much better earlier in his career, or he'd blatantly copy other, better writers (such as Stephen King). But I just couldn't resist The Taking. I'm a big fan of end-of-the-world stories, and this one sounded promising enough.  <br /> <br />Does Koontz succeed this time around? Well, yes and no. The first half of this book is incredibly long-winded and repetitive. But once the story picks up, around page 200, the book becomes somewhat entertaining. <br /> <br />Molly and Neil wake up in the middle of the night to discover that the entire world is being destroyed by an unseen force. Soon enough, they leave their house and head towards the main part of town because they don't feel safe where they are. <br /> <br />And weird things ARE happening all around them. A weird, sweet-tasting rain is falling on the world, weird crafts hover above their heads, strange creatures inhabit homes and trees, the dead come back to life, dolls come to life.... Nowhere is safe. There is nowhere to hide. They soon realise that aliens are overtaking the world. And as everyone around them slowly disappear, Molly and Neil will discover that they have a very important purpose in all of this. <br /> <br />Koontz isn't a brilliant writer. His writing is simple, and often laughable (some of his similes are so ludicrous they made me want to throw the book across the room). His characters are flat and barely distinguishable from one another. But he does know how to create suspense. The moment our main characters arrive in town, the suspense is elevated and the book becomes quite entertaining.  <br /> <br />But how do you end such a story? Well, even Koontz can't answer this. The book ends too abruptly and easily for it to be satisfying. Throughout the story, Koontz compares his story to War of the Worlds and other classic alien stories. Well, The Taking is nowhere close to being as good as those movies and books were. But for what it is, The Taking is quite readable and even fun at times. But still, it'll be quite a while until I pick another one of Koontz's book.	2005-04-30

Snow Angels, The Speed Queen, The Night Country... His books are always incredibly well written, amazingly powerful and gripping. <br /> <br />Now, after publishing The Night Country (his best book to date), he's back with The Good Wife, a soft, touching drama about the things a woman sacrifices for love. When Patty's husband is arrested for murder, arson and unlawful entry, she can't believe that the man she loves could ever be guilty of the crimes he's accused of committing. But after an unfair trial, he's sent to prison for life. And Patty, pregnant and broke, is left alone to deal with her life. <br /> <br />Within the next three hundred pages, O'Nan moves through 30 years of pain and shame, as Patty tries to remain faithful and good to her husband, all the while caring for their quiet, sad son, Casey. Indeed, Patty is a good wife. Although temptation is always around the corner, the love she feels for Tommy and for their son is greater than anything else she might feel inside.  <br /> <br />It isn't easy being left alone to deal with their growing son and the world around them. But somehow, she manages. She goes from job to job, never able to find something she can call her own. Even her son is like a stranger to her. She doesn't understand him, she doesn't understand life. By the time Tommy is released from prison, they have grown old and their son is an adult. But the pain and the hardship remains. What you think will be a happy ending for this family is only a new beginning.  <br /> <br />It's amazing to see that O'Nan is able to move so seamlessly through nearly thirty years of a woman's life. His writing is poetic and powerful. Every word is important, every paragraph necessary to understand the characters and plot. This is a novel that is all about characters. <br /> <br />But in the end, this one is not nearly as amazing as some of O'Nan's previous efforts. In the end, this isn't a story that will stay with you for a long time.  <br /> <br />I could easily see this novel becoming a serial television show. Every week, we'd see what Patty has to live through. We'd see her grow old as the world around her is never truly ready to accept her. The Good Wife is a nice story, don't get me wrong, just not a very important one.	2005-04-24

After all, without all of his work to bring back the pulp noir of the 40s and 50s, The Invoker probably wouldn't exist. This is a raw book filled with raw and unsympathetic characters. These vampires aren't searching for redemption, they're only trying to make it trough another day. They are full of irony, witty comebacks and they lust for action and blood.  <br /> <br />Lawson is yet again our main character. A vampire who has seen it all (in Merz's novels, vampires do drink blood, but the supersitions about garlic and holy water and the sun is only a myth; they walk in daylight and the only way to kill them is by piercing their skin with wood), Lawson is a gritty narrator who hides nothing from the readers. <br /> <br />This time, he is hired to killed a man. Only, upon killing him, the man asks Lawson to protect his son. His son, a vampire with the ability to invoke spirits from the other side, is being hunted. Lawson quickly decides to do anything in his power to protect the child from harm.  <br /> <br />The first half of the book is incredibly fast paced and a great joy for the reader. But when the kid is kidnapped and Lawson finds himself hiking through Tibet, the book becomes slow and repetitive, as if Merz just stretched everything out for as long as he could to give his book an acceptable length. Still, it all brings us to a satisfying if predictable finale. <br /> <br />The Vampire Lawson series isn't groundbreaking, but it's great fun to read. This is a little quickie that you can read for the sole purpose of entertainment and amusement. Merz's writing is tight and Lawson always has a witty comeback just waiting to erupt from his lips. Here's hoping that the series keeps being so much fun!	2005-04-18

He can deliver the shocks (Nature of Balance) or great psychological thrills (Face). Desolation stands somewhere between those two and the result is disappointing. It's not that Desolation is a bad book. In fact, there's a lot to be found in this short tale of psychological horror. It's just that the story offers very little to like, or dislike. <br /> <br />Cain has been released from the only place he knew as home. His father has kept him prisoner for years, doing psychological experiment on his young self. But now that the old man is dead, Cain is freed from the prison he was trapped in. He moves into an apartment complex in the hopes of starting his life anew. <br /> <br />Only problem is that everyone in his new home is just a little off. As soon as he moves in, Cain has horrible nightmares. And some of his childhood fears come back to haunt him. And soon enough, he discovers that everyone out there is out to get him. This house hides many horrible secrets, all of them tied directly to his father and his past. Now Cain has no choice but to face his fear and to accept the monster that resides within him. <br /> <br />Desolation offers very little to enjoy. The pacing is slow and often tedious and none of these characters are likeable. In order to make a horror tale successful, you need a hero to root for. But Cain is way too boring and quiet for you to actually like him. Often, you just want to slap him, wake him up and make him smell the coffee.  <br /> <br />And, although the pacing is slow, the whole thing also feels rushed. It's almost as if Lebbon just beefed up a novel outline he had lying around without giving any real effort to the process. Scenes appear out of nowhere, discoveries are made out of the blue and thigns are revealed that never truly explain anything or make any sense. Although some vintage Lebbon appears in the tale (like shapeshifting humans), it's nothing you can call genuine Lebbon.  <br /> <br />I'm a big Lebbon fan. And every author is entitled to his or her mistake. This is the first book of story of Lebbon's I have disliked. Here's hoping that his creative juices are still flowing and that his next one will outtop Desolation.	2005-04-04

His follow-up, The Snow Garden, left a sour taste in my mouth. It was a very predictable and soap opera-ish murder story. Well, I wanted to give Rice another chance, so I bought his newest Light Before Day. I'm saddened to say that this book did very little change my mind about Rice as a writer. <br /> <br />Light Before Day is another soap opera, this time centered around the L.A. gay scene. Adam is beautiful, popular and an alcoholic. When his ex-boyfriend disappears, Adam decides to take on the case and try to uncover the mystery behind his disappearence. Soon enough, an entire plot in uncovered, one that concerns closeted soldiers, a child pornography ring, murder and all the mayhem you can get and more out of 300-pages long book. <br /> <br />Maybe this story would have been more tolerable if the book wasn't filled with so many horrible characters. There isn't one guy who feels real in this story. Through the storyline, the author wanted to break some of the beliefs about the gay scene. Only problem is that the book only seems to reinforce some of the ideas some people have about the gay world; that everyone's pretty, overly concerned about their looks, drug addicts, sex addicts and pedophiles. And the fact that none of these characters are very likeable doesn't help matters much. <br /> <br />This is supposed to be a mystery novel. But everything is always too easy for Adam. First, there are too many twists and turns in this story. By the end, you aren't entertained anymore, you're just feeling annoyed. And Adam never makes any real discoveries. Instead, the action stops, Adam thinks things over and just like that, out of nowhere, the answers come to him. The protagonist in a mystery should work for the answershe's looking for. <br /> <br />Adam starts the book as an alcoholic and drug addict. But by page 50, he's put all of that behind him. Right, like a junkie wouldn't have any withdrawal symptoms. But of course not. Adam's strong. Adam's our hero. Adam can't be flawed. <br /> <br />I took this one hoping to like it. Instead, the more I think of it, the more I'm annoyed by Light Before Day. Rice should stop trying to write genre stories and should concentrate on more dramatic novels. With this one, he tried too hard to be Bret Easton Ellis crossed with Raymond Chandler. Well, Rice isn't strong enough of a writer to be anything like those two writers.	2005-03-15

It also give its readers a very generous lesson on the history of the box office take, going from the very early days up until today. What the authors have done is to give the readers an inside-look into the Hollywood machine so that we can all understand better what constitutes a hit. <br /> <br />The authors have decided to study the three films that opened on the 4th of July weekend in 2003; Terminator 3, Legally Blonde 2 and Sinbad. From their moment of conception up to their release, the authors study the various stages the films went through before finally arriving to the Silver Screen. Through this, they also give us history lesson on firms like EDI Nelson, Technicolor, some studio anecdotes and a great, detailed history of the movie theatre itself. <br /> <br />The book never sides with one studio or one person. The authors remain impartial throughout, something that seems fresh, especially since this book is discussing Hollywood. Although the authors give a bit more attention to Terminator 3 (the biggest film of the three) and very little to Sinbad, what they do give us is very detailed and informative. <br /> <br />This is a great book about the Hollywood machine. Ever wondered why some movies flop, while others are a success? Ever wondered how a film is created, how various test screenings can help change a film and the marketing behind it, how word of mouth can make or kill a film? Then this one will probably answer most of your questions.	2005-02-23

Nor his victims. As a matter of fact, the killer in the story is just like the remnants of a bad dream that just won't go away. A ghost that is never made whole. Instead, the book is about tragedy, and how it can change a life forever. <br /> <br />Mattie still can't forget the events of his childhood. As the new school year unravels, the entire city will soon be terrorized by the Snowman killer, who abducts young children and then leave them for dead in the snow.  <br /> <br />Mattie is trying to trudge along, but when sad turns of events prevents him from seeing his best friend Theresa, he concots a plan with his best friend Spencer to try and get her back. These three friends have a very special bond that is always threaten by Theresa's strange actions and changing personality. These are fully realized characters that are both odd and intriguing in their realism.  <br /> <br />The books isn't about those murdered children or the murderer. Instead, it's about childhood, friendship, loyalty and the loss of everything we hold dear. This is a coming of age tale that is often sad, poignant and touching.  <br /> <br />Hirshberg writes like someone who has been doing this for all of his life. His prose is beautiful. He often describes things in a way that is visually striking. He writes emotionally, though not in a cheap I-want-your-tears way. Instead, his words are drenched in nostalgia. The plot moves back and forth through time, leaving it to the reader to piece everything back together. Just like the mystery at the heart of this book, the reader has to put it all back together in the end. <br /> <br />Many questions are left unanswered in this literary thriller, and that's fine. Because what Hirshberg has achieved isn't your average thriller. Beautifully written and always profoundly affecting, The Snowman's Children is a very rewarding read that you won't soon forget.	2005-02-15

The book had the potential to become a good noir thriller, but instead, it fizzles into a mess of nonsense. <br /> <br />Charles is a middle-aged man who's life borers normality. There isn't any spark left in his marriage and his daughter is afflicted with a severe case of diabetes. He's not that happy with his job anymore, and he's just looking for something to bring back the excitement in his life. <br /> <br />He finds it in Lucinda, a woman he sees on the train. He automatically falls in love with her. He begins an affair with her, something that culminates in their going to a cheap, dirty, sleazy motel together. But their session is quickly brought to a stop when a man bursts into their motel room and assaults them. <br /> <br />The man isn't about to disappear from Charles's life. Of course, he comes back. Asking for money. Then asking for more. And then more? And Charles? Like the sad puppy that he is, he lowers his eyes to the ground and does everything he's told to do. Add problems at work and with the police to this scenario, and Charles's life is quickly spiralling down into a cahotic mess. <br /> <br />There are three major flaws to be found in Derailed. For one, Siegel chose to write the story in the first person. The first quarter of the book is actually written in the third person, and it had me going, keeping my interest sustained. But then the novel veers in a new direction, the narrative voice changes, and the novel takes a turn for the worse. Spiegel isn't able to find a true voice for his character, which makes the narration sound so much more vague and distant.  <br /> <br />Another major flaw can be found in the main character himself. There is nothing to like about Charles. He keeps putting himself in horrible situations, keeps digging his own grave, and we're supposed to care for him. Is it so hard to go to the policeand tell them you're being blackmailed? Especially when your life and your family are at stake? Charles deserves everything that's coming to him. After a while, I was even wishing for him to fail! <br /> <br />The last major flaw can be found in two major plot twists during the course of this story. Siegel must think his readers are complete idiots. First, you can see where this story is going from a mile away. And two, the last plot twist, the one that saves our main character from his inevitable fate, is so ludicrous and out of context that it made me want to stop reading the book right there and then. <br /> <br />What could have been a good noir thriller in the tradition of Cain or Double Indemnity is nothing more than a cheesy and ludicrous story filled with stock characters and unbelieveable plots. Skip this one, you'll be doing yourself a favor.	2005-02-03

Sometimes, you find that one truly amazing book that you know you'll want to read time and time again, that you want to tell all your friends about, that just won't leave your mind. The Curious Incident is such a book. <br /> <br />The story is narrated and told from the point of view of Christopher John Francis Boone, a fifteen year old autistic boy. What seems like a given to us is often a challenge for Christopher. He can't stomach the colours yellow and brown, he has a pet for a rat and he doesn't understand jokes or emotions very well. If there is one thing he's good at, it's mathematics. <br /> <br />Christopher decides to become an investigator when he finds the murdered body of Wellington, his neighbour's dog. Having read some Sherlock Holmes stories, Christopher knows what it takes to become a good detective. And, although he always tells the truth, he will go against his father's wishes and investigate to find the dog's murderer.  <br /> <br />But his investigation turns sour when Christopher ends up discovering secrets concerning his own life and his deceased mother. Christopher has no choice but to go on a journey that will change his life forever. <br /> <br />This book is simply magical. Having worked with autistic children, I can truly say that Haddon really go into Christopher's mind, writing down everything a boy with such a condition would think or feel. Fear is a common thing for Christopher. Touching him often triggers a violent reaction in him. And he is unable to finish his plate if different foods are touching each other. Haddon was really able to go into the mind of an autistic child. <br /> <br />I can't wait to read this one again, and to give it to as many people as I can. It's a rare thing to find such a magically, well-written and completely entertaining novel. Dare to goon this journey, you won't forget it.	2005-01-24

The first half of the book had me in tears because of the author's satirical and witty sense of humor. This is a book that pretends to be serious about a possible zombie upheaval and it is surprisingly well researched, as if the author had spent many many hours looking at zombie movies in order to decide which escape plan would be best, which kind of gun should be use, and what to do in case of total annihilation. <br /> <br />Still, near the half mark, the book loses steam. And fast. I found myself skipping the last part of the book, which describes the different \\"reported\\" zombie attacks throughout history. That whole section (nearly 100 pages) is redundant and very repetitive. None of it was actually funny, or very interesting.  <br /> <br />The book is recommended for its actual field guide section. What to do if zombies attack? Well, this book will answer this question and then some. Everything from food, to the types of guns and weapons best suited to fight these monsters, to the different types of possible attacks (according to the author, there are three), all of it is covered in depth and in a very funny manner. <br /> <br />I had a love-hate relationship with this book. Although it did make me laugh on numerous occasions, I was still slightly disappointed in the end. Read the first half, then skip the rest...	2005-01-17
US	49059365	R2OO5IC33IJMAL	0843954744	477906523	Newbies	Books	1	3	5	N	N	What A Disappointment	I have to admit that I bought this James A. Moore novel thinking that it was his new horror novel. Moore has written many great tales of horror that have astonished me in many ways. But Newbies, his first Young Adult novel, is a mess. Repetitive, hastily plotted and filled with unbelievable characters, this one feels like the outline of a bigger, maybe better novel that was never given the light of day.  <br /> <br />Brittany is attending the Dunhaven Academy, a very expensive private school lost in the heart of a dying small town. It's not easy being the new girl in school. She has trouble making friends, and she has trouble making amends with her past. <br /> <br />Kids at school are disappearing without a trace. And when Reggie, the town's bully, kidnaps Brittany's only friend, Casey, events take a strange turn into the mystical and the paranormal. <br /> <br />I like YA novels. But writing a YA story doesn't mean that you have to dumb things down for your audience. Here, it's as if Moore is writing this story for seven year olds. He explains things over and over and over again. He always presents the characters even though we already knows them (instead of just referring to Kelly, it's always her new friend Kelly, instead of just naming Casey, it's always her brother Casey). In one instance, the words 'of sorts' appear seven time on the very same page.  <br /> <br />The whole thing seems that have been written in haste. The story could have been trimmed down by fourty pages without losing anything whatsoever. This one is a major disappointment, because Moore is a very talented and effective writer. But with this one, he completely missed the boat.	2005-01-12

Set in the high-class 80s London world, the novel offers characters you will love to hate. These are very complicated people, filling an even more complicated narrative. <br /> <br />Nick Guest has just moved in with the Tippers, the parents of Toby, one of his best college friends. The head of the household, Gerald, holds a job in the Parliament, while his wife, Rachel, seems to be just another unhappy blue-blood wife. Their daughter, Cat, is highly excitable and very tourmented. She doesn't want to be part of the life she's leading, while also loving the chances and opportunities she's been given. <br /> <br />Nick is the narrator of the Tipper's life, as well as his own. Never impartial, Nick is the ever-present boy who loves to watch the defeat of others. The fact that nick is always on the prowl, finding romance in different places (like Leonard, his first love, or Wani, the son of a very, very successful and rich businessman) only adds and edge to his character. As the 80s pass him by, he will be faced with one drama after another, whether it be about his own personal life or about the AIDS epidemic that is slowly ravaging London's gay community.  <br /> <br />Nick is the character you will love to hate and hate to love. You never truly understand him, yet his story always makes you hungry for more. It's very hard to put this one down. <br /> <br />Hollinghurst has written a novel that is at times bitingly funny, at times incredibly sad. This dichotomy helps make A Line of Beauty the very exciting read that it is. Never too complicated for the reader's own good, but never too simple to make you want to put this one down. A Line of Beauty is a very rare literary novel that you can truly enjoy.	2005-01-04

The Crimson Petal and the White is an amazing book, and Under the Skin is a great original tale. Faber writes original plots that take you to a place and time you've never been before. But with the Courage Consort, Faber offers us three short tales that, while usually entertaining, are not as fascinating as his novels. <br /> <br />The title story, The Courage Consort, is also the collection's weakest. A group of opera singers go to a mansion in the middle of the woods to practice their latest show in solitude. The story's heroine, Catherine, is a troubled and depressed woman who doesn't know what she wants out of life anymore. Or, for that matter, if she even has the will to live another day. Although the tale offers many touching moments, in the end, it ends up nowhere. This allegory of life and death isn't all that it's cracked up to be. <br /> <br />The Hundred and Ninety-nine Steps is a very good mystery about an archeologist's obssession with an old document that has just been recovered. She also uses this document as a pretense to let herself fall in love with a mysterious young doctor. Although the story is very entertaining, it is rather long-winded and, at times, repetitive. I wanted to know more about that mysterious document than about the characters.  <br /> <br />The real reason to read this collection is for the last, and shortest story of the lot : The Farenheit Twins. When Tainto and Marko lose their mother, they leave on a trek into the wild winter woods to bury her body. But their father has really sent them on a suicide mission from which they are not supposed to return. This modern Hansel and Gretel tale is touching, moving and very effective. This is what a Faber story is all about. <br /> <br />I have to admit that I was disappointed by The Courage Consort. Yes, thewriting is beautiful, as always, and yes his characters are usually very interesting. But these qualities were not enough tosave the collection. Although none of the stories are bad or not enjoyable, I've come to expect more and better from Faber. Please oh please give us another Crimson Petal or Under the Skin!	2004-12-24

Not only is Afterlife a great horror story, it also stands as one of Clegg's most suspenseful tale yet. This one has all the elements of a classic in the making.    Julie's life is turned upside down when she learns that her husband was brutally murdered. She is left alone to grieve with her young daughter and her strange teenage stepson. Everyone around her wants to help; her sister Melanie, her mother, her friends, her therapist... Yet no one is able to help her forget the pane of her husband's death.    But as she tries her best to return to her normal life, strange things happen to Julie. She dreams of strange, erotic thoughts. Her husband's body disappears from the morgue. She she learns about her husband's past, a past he had kept hidden from her all these years. A stranger enters her home at night and disappears. As Julie searches for the truth, she feels the constant threat of being watched, and the nightmares become more and more real. The only person she can trust is a strange television psychic who will try to help her through this ordeal.    Or is he? Clegg creates a great webb of paranoia that prevents you from trusting any of the characters except Julie. And even Julie is a flawed character. Sometimes, you root for her, and sometimes you just want to slap her in the face to make her open her eyes and accept the truth for what it truly is. Such a character only turns a very good story into an even greater one.    This story is similar to some of the genre's best. Rosemary's Baby comes to mind. Like Levin's amazing tale of suspense, Clegg creates a suspenseful tale that never lets go of the grip it has on you. You can't help yourself; you just want to keep on turning the pages way past your bedtime. And what Clegg does best is write about the grief Julie is going through. Some of the scenes early on in the story are just heart wrenching.     Douglas Clegg is fast becoming one of the greatest new voice in horror fiction, and Afterlife is the perfect example of his amazing talent. Suspenseful, full of horror, and vastly entertaining, Afterlife might very well be the best horror novel of the year!	2004-12-15

Serial killers just aren't as interesting or as terrifying as they used to be. We haven't seen a Hannibal Lector or a Norman Bates in years. So when you find a decent, engrossing and entertaining suspense novel, you jump on it and hold on tight to it. Night Cage is such a book. The third Harper book takes you down a road of madness and psychological mayhem that quickly turns into a very vivid nightmare. <br /> <br />Although his life has been filled with dangerous situations, Trey Campbell still works at Darden State Hospital, home to the criminally insane. When a young man who calls himself Doc is brought into his care, accused of murder, Trey quickly finds himself in the middle of a  revenge story twenty years in the making. <br /> <br />Doc just happens to be the son of Bloody Mary, aka Mary Chilmark, an ex-patient of Darden's who's son was conceived in that very hospital. No one truly knows who Doc's father truly is, although it had to be someone who worked at the hospital. And now Mary Chilmark wants to set things straight and, with her son's help, get revenge for the wrong that was done to her.  <br /> <br />With the help of Jane Laymon, The Red Angel's fearless young cop, Trey will have to uncover the dark secrets that Doc and his mother have been hiding for such a long time before Bloody Mary acts out her rage once again. <br /> <br />The book's beginning slowly sets up the story, but once it begins unravelling, the suspense amounts to a whole new level of greatness. The last hundred pages are a breeze to the reader. You just won't be able to put this one down. <br /> <br />Harper has shown once again that he can weave a great, entertaining tale of suspense. This time, instead of going for action and violence, he goes for psychological scares and tension, and the genre agrees quite nicely with his style. Breezy and fast-paced, Night Cage comes highly recommended.	2004-12-08

Now, he is back with Color Blind, which, although not as entertaining and striking as his debut effort, proves that the author has a great deal of talent when it comes to creating an intricate tale of suspense. <br /> <br />Kate McKinnon, The Death Artist's heroine, is back in this new tale of the art world gone wrong. This time, a serial killer leaves small paintings at the murder scene as his calling card. Only, the paintings seem odd since the colors are all wrong in these paintings. The NYPD is quick to call Kate since she so successfully resolved the Death Artist case.  <br /> <br />But this case becomes personal when Kate's husband, Richard, is found brutally murdered in a fashion similar to the other murders. Is Richard's murder connected to the other case? And where will the Artist strike next? Although Kate is a retired NYPD agent, she quickly gets back into mode in order to solve the case before more innocent people fall victim to the brutal killer. <br /> <br />What I liked about the Death Artist was that Kate was an imperfect character in an imperfect world. She had her celebrity (coming from her television art show) and she traveled across the world, mingling with major artists. She came off as a bit pretentious at times, which was a change of pace from the all-too-perfect characters that people today's crime fiction. But in Color Blind, all of that is forgotten. Kate becomes a great, simple lady who seems just too perfect at times which was greatly disappointing at times.  <br /> <br />Santlofer is great at mixing art with fiction. Throughout the novel, he often gives his readers quick little lessons in art history. None of it is too expository or overly done. He gives us just enough to be able to comprehend the world we're in and the people we're facing. And he brings us right into the killer's shoes, a technique I more than welcomed. It gave the story that extra little something thatmade the whole read greatly entertaining. <br /> <br />I can't say that I enjoyed Color Blind as much as I had The Death Artist. Nonetheless, Santlofer's freshman effort is still very intense at times and it offers a finally that will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat. This one is still better than most mysteries you'll find out there these days.	2004-11-23

He has devoted a great deal of his career to the master of terror, writig columns in Cemetery Dance magazine that is everything King and writing essays on the author. I don't think there is a greater King expert out there. And now, his labor of love, The Road To The Dark Tower, is in print and it's been worth the wait. <br /> <br />The Dark Tower is King's epic masterpiece that has been more than twenty years in the making. King wrote the very first installment of the novel when he was in College and throughout his career, he has kept readers guessing by sporadically delivering new tomes in the series. But this year marked the publication of the very last Dark Tower book, a very sad event for any King lover. <br /> <br />Vincent takes us through that very journey, summarizing every single book in the series, finding links between each tomes and with other King books. He gives us the history behind the story (King was inspired by a poem named The Dark Tower) and the story behind the publication of the first tome. He also devotes an entire section to linking most of King's novels to the Dark Tower. The book is full of helpful annecdotes and pictures that will only broaden your grasp of King's story.  <br /> <br />Written expertly but not in a way that ever feels pretentious, Road takes you through the journey that is the Dark Tower all over again and makes you realize many things you might have missed upon your first reading of the books. This is a must for every King fan and required reading for any Dark Tower lover.	2004-11-23

His horror never attacks you at the jugular. It never goes for cheap thrills of cheap scares. Instead, his novels brings you through journeys of despair and oddity, through madness and back. You never quite know what to expect when beginnin a Straub book, and In The Night Room is genuine Straub. <br /> <br />In The Night Room isn't a sequel to last year's amazing lost boy, lost girl. Instead, it somehow works as a continuation of that story. Here, Tim Underhill, a famous writer, is working on his latest invention. He's still haunted by his nephew's disappearence and he still has trouble dealing with the events surrounding his disappearence. He's also receiving strange e-mails from what seems to be an angel, weird cryptic messages that are telling him that his last book angered the other world, something he must now remedy. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Willy is still haunted by the death of her husband and daughter. But when she realizes that the man she is now supposed to marry might have murdered her ex-husband, her whole world tumbles down into oblivion. <br /> <br />How these two stories mix, I cannot tell because it would ruin quite a great surprise. But the shock of the twist Straub offers halfway through the story quite delivers the punch. Unfortunately, after that point, the book loses some of its steam and mysteriousness and the ending just seems to evaporate. Because the story never really ends, it just slowly goes one way and then suddenly stops. <br /> <br />Too many questions are left unanswered in In The Night Room, as if Straub was deliberately trying to confuse his readers at times.  Then again, reading a Straub book is always a treat. His writing is very poetic, his sentences always hiding many surprises for the reader. Straub is an amazing writer. Even when his stories faulter, his writing style is enough to keep you turning the pages. <br /> <br />In The Night Room is just weird enough to be calledentertaining. This is the story of a writer and of the writer's world, of the blurry line between reality and fiction. Following lost boy, lost girl, In The Night Room seems to fall short in the end. But as it is, the novel is quite an entertaining ride you'll want to take right up until the end.	2004-11-09
US	49059365	R9OK7JPAGC634	0786015802	514785227	The Manor	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Atmospheric and Eerie	The Manor is Scott Nicholson's third book and it also stands as his best. Although his first two efforts were quite entertaining, The Manor proves that Nicholson is a leading voice in the horror field. With this book, he takes his place amongst some of the genre's modern masters, proving that there is still originality and talent to be found out there. <br /> <br />The Manor itself is quite a simple story. A group of artists are invited to an old manor for a six week retreat where they will be working their crafts. The manor's owner, Ephram Korban, was a strange, powerful man who always found a way to get what he wanted. Even after his death, his presence seems to run through the halls of the old house. His framed painted face is mounted on the wall of every room in the house, and every servant seems to talk about the man as though he was still alive. <br /> <br />Mason, a young sculptor looking for fame in all the wrong places, is one of the guests at the manor. As soon as he starts to work, he almost becomes possessed by his new creation; a life-sized wood statue of the Manor's owner. We have a photographer, who seems to be obssessed with the house. A filmmaker who decides the manor would be the greatest subject for a documentary. A writer who desperately wants to find his talent and skills again... In fact, the only guest who isn't an artist is Anna, a young clairvoyant who seems to have a link with spirits, and the house itself. Needless to say, Anna will play a huge role in the events that will soon follow the guests' arrival.  <br /> <br />The scares slowly creep up on you. Paintings change by themselves. Strange figures appear in the woods at night... It takes a while for the book to really pick up the scares, but once it does, it does delievers the goods. The finale is particularly well written, a 60 pages tour de force that is so relentless it will leave you breathless.  <br /> <br />The Manor never goes overboard on frights of gore. As a matter of fact, there is very little gore to be found in the story. What we have instead is quiet horror, the kind that relies on suspense more than anything else. The book reminded me of The Picture of Dorian Gray mixed with something Daphne Dumorier would have written. <br /> <br />The Manor is Scott Nicholson's best book yet. After finishing it, I can honestly say that I can't wait to get my hands on the next one!	2004-11-04
US	49059365	R1S59AM10U6OWB	0312315945	993897127	Magical Thinking: True Stories	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Another great one!	After reading Sellevision, Running with Scissors and Dry, I didn't think Burroughs would have much left in him. After all, there is only so much a single person can comment on. But Magical Thinking proved me wrong. This collection of essays, if not as substantial as his other works, is funny, witty and highly entertaining. I can't remember the last time a book made me smile and laugh so much (well, sure I do, that last book was probably Dry...) <br /> <br />In Magical Thinking, Burroughs offers a series of unrelated essays that deal with different moments of his life. My favorite of the lot is entitled Debby's Requirements, where Augusten describes his peculiar relationship with his housekeeper. Burroughs is strong headed, but he surely meets his match here. The story had me rolling on the floor laughing. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed Roof Work, about a strange hole inside the author's mouth and The Rat/Thing, where the author describes his attempts at killing a little mouse. Telemarketing Revenge tells us what to do when we get an unwanted call from a pesky telemarketer, and I Dated an Undertaker is a very comical take on strange relationships.  <br /> <br />Burroughs covers entire chapters of his life in this collection, from his childhood to his present relationship with his life partner Dennis. Unfortunately, the essays that cover the latter sections of his life, his \\"happy period\\", are not always as funny or bitterly saritical, as if the author had somewhat been softened by this new relationship. <br /> <br />Still, Magical Thinking is a great collection of comical stories that is comparable to anything David Sedaris (and Sedaris is mentioned in the essay Blurb Whore, in which Burroughs describe his attempts at getting blurbs from various authors for his first memoir) has written. Magical Thinking will surely make you laugh. Burroughs has a very peculiar kind of humour that is just what I like; slightly dark, slightly saritical, and always, always ready to take abig bite out of any given subject.	2004-10-29

And now, after so many years, King has completed the Dark Tower saga. And let me tell you that he does not go away with a small pow, but with a large bang. And the weirdness factor is blown up to the highest levels, and yet, the story still works. <br /> <br />In this installment, Roland and his ka-tet are that much closer to the tower. But before he reaches it, he will be faced with the kind of hardships he has been faced with ever since his quest began. And unfortunately, that means not everyone will see the end of the journey. Unfortunately, this installment hides many dark, unpleasant surprises for the reader.  <br /> <br />King himself also returns as a very important character. King has often been able to mix elements of his own life to his fiction. But things get real heavy with DT7, because Kings mixes his own accident that nearly cost him his life to Roland's quest. What could have easily been quite pretentious from King's part is actually a great pleasure for the reader.  <br /> <br />As Roland travels through the different worlds, and as he encounters new characters, a new boy will cross his way. It's unfortunate that Patrick wasn't introduced earlier in the series. The boy who can draw anything with a frightening life-like result  was very intriguing and totally underused by the author. And, being a child (children, in King's fiction, tend to always hide some kind of power or secret), you can be certain that his skills hides some kind of power that Roland will use to its full advantage when the time comes.  <br /> <br />Does Roland reach the tower? Does the book feature a happy ending? Well, it would be, after so many years and so many pages, quite wrong to reveal this. But let me just say that, for me, the book ended on just the right note. <br /> <br />It's a sad thing to realise that I will never again be faced with Roland's new adventures. Every good thing must come to an end. In this case, King has gone out with a bang instead of a whimper, a loud explosion of creativity that will stay with you for quite some time.	2004-10-21
US	49059365	R1IHJ7JC34M1NV	0743222954	337618584	At Swim, Two Boys: A Novel	Books	3	6	10	N	N	Beautiful If Often Without Aim	At Swim, Two Boys is a beautiful love story centered around the friendship of two sixteen year old boys. Author Jamie O'Neill spent 10 years working on this story, and his labour of love is defenitely worth a read. The story offers many tender moments that will stay with you for a long time. But the book is overpopulated by too many characters who just walk in and out of the boys's life without any real purpose, and in the end, the story meanders so much that it alienates some of the story's power. <br /> <br />Jim is an Irish boy who seems to live a pretty ordinary life. While his brother is fighting the war overseas, he lives with his father and aunt, helping out with the family's general stores. But when he rekindles his friendship with Doyler, a childhood friend, this becomes complicated. Their friendship builds as they meet every day to swim together.  <br /> <br />Jim and Doyle are falling in love with one another. While Jim isn't sure how to deal with these strange new feelings, Doyler wants more out of their friendship. He seeks the help of a friend, MacMurrough, who was deported from Englend back to Ireland after having found guilty of loving another man. And although I didn't mind following these characters around, I didn't particularly enjoyed reading about Mr Mack, Jim's father, or about MacMurrough's twisted aunt or about a subplot concerning a pregnant woman Jim's brother left behind. All these side stories took away from the main story at the heart of this book.   <br /> <br />I loved the book's first half. The characters slowly build toward their goals and you can almost feel the confusion and anxiety between the boys. But the moment the war explodes in Ireland, the moment Doyler decides to join the civilian army to fight the invading Brits, the books becomes too complicated for its own good. It's almost as if the story looses its heart and soul. The characters grow cold and confused and whatever feelings were present between them slowly evaporates.<br /> <br />That is somewhat lessened when the two boys leave at Easter for a swim to a small remote island (keeping a childhood promise they had made to one another). But that moment is too quickly torn away from the reader by a dark and unnecessary turn of events. <br /> <br />I enjoyed At Swim, Two Boys. The book is worth reading and is often very touching. But a part of me just wasn't fully satisfied with it all. As a whole, the book isn't as emotionnally striking as it should have been. But when taken it parts, its reading can be quite magical.	2004-09-26

Forget vampires, forget werewolves; it's zombies people are obssessed with. So now we are bound to see a penury of cheaply and hastily written books centered around this already tired horror theme. <br /> <br />Xombies tries to rejuvenate the genre and give it a twist, but because of idiotic plot twists and badly written dialogue, the book fails to become something slightly above-average and better than the rest of the crop out there. <br /> <br />Lulu wakes up on the verge of a world-wide breakdown. There is an epidemic out there caused by Agent X, a virus that infects women, men and children alike. No one is safe from the virus. No one save Lulu, our seventeen year old heroine. <br /> <br />After seeing her mother turn into a blue-faced living dead, she joins her long-lost father aboard a submarine that will take her across the USA all the way to greenland. But it's not easy being the only girl aboard the ship, especially not when she's the obvious benefactor of favoritism. She quickly befriends some of the men, but her hardships will be greater than what she can deal with.  <br /> <br />As they are safely traveling beneath the sea, far away from the destroyed world and on their way toward a secret mission, Lulu will be faced with her share of problems and will find herself in many dangerous situations.  <br /> <br />Worth reading? No. Scary? No. Interesting? Maybe.... There are some good ideas behind this story, ideas that could have been fleshed out just a little bit more to make this one a truly entertaining read. But because none of the characters are particularly interesting (characters come in and out of the story and you are never given the time to care for any of them), you slowly find your interst into the story dwindling.  <br /> <br />And the author does not help his cause by writing ridiculously laughable dialogue that made me cringe. Lulu is annoying, childish and not very engaging. I wantmore from a heroine. I want someone I can identify with, someone I want to guide me through those 350 pages. Can you imagine being trapped on a long voyage with a tour guide you just can't stand?  <br /> <br />And that's too bad, because in the end, the book does offer a few very surprising twists and chills. Yet another perfect example of a failed attempt at expressing a very interesting concept.	2004-09-02

Over the years, he has used his family to discuss everything that seems to disturb him about the world he lives him. He's able to see the small peculiarities of life and transfer them to the page into laugh-out-loud marathons. <br /> <br />True, Dress Your Family in Curduroy isn't as funny as Sedaris's previous essay collections. In fact, this collection has more heart and is much more poignant. But once again, he holds no barrel when it comes down to discussing his family; Sedaris talks about his brother's wedding, his niece's birth, their family vacations to various places and his relationship with his partner without hiding much from the reader. One essay even discuss his siblings's dislike in being discusses in Sedaris's writing.  <br /> <br />I love when Sedaris discusses his childhood. If you thought your family was strange or dysfunctional, one quick look at Sedaris's memories is enough to comfort you into believing that your own family might not be as odd as you believe them to be.  <br /> <br />I had read many of these essays before in various magazines. But reading them all over again only makes you discover even more laughs and smiles. Sedaris is a master at hiding small jokes that will only be found with repeated readings. The expression 'reading between the lines' always applies when it comes to Sedaris. <br /> <br />Sweet, touching, funny, sometimes even a bit shocking (as one essay concerning his fear of touching a young boy in a hotel room and another about murdering a mouse) are elements that are all very present in this collection. Sedaris never disappoints. I'm sure you'll want to read this gem of a collection more than once.	2004-08-23

It took me to a place that felt quite new and thrilling. It offered great romance, great suspense and some very dark scenes that seemed right out of a classic horror movie. This is literature at its very best!<br /><br />Daniel has grown up around books. His father owns a bookshop and transferred his love of fiction to his son. On his tenth birthday, he is brought to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, the place where old books that no one remembers are kept safely hidden away. That's where he finds a book called The Shadow of the Wind by a man name Julian Carax. Little does Daniel know that this find will forever change the course of his life.<br /><br />As he grows up, Daniel realises that his book might very well be a curse to him. First, a dark man with burnt skin corners him in a street, demanding to be given the book, the very same man who has been scavanging the four corners of Europe for Carax's books in order to burn them and erase the author's work forever. Daniel quickly becomes enthralled with the mystery behind the man and slowly begans to uncover years upon years of dark, hidden secrets.<br /><br />Daniel also has to cope with his newfound love, Beatriz, his best friend's sister. Their forbidden love will only bring them closer. Helped by his father's employee, Fermin, and Beatriz, Daniel will go on a quest to uncover the life of the great, forgotten author, a quest that will threaten his very life and the ones of the people he loves.<br /><br />This is a novel for anyone who love books. It is a rich story that is often funny, often filled with sorrow. I loved every single character in this story. Every new chapter brought forth a new and unexepected twist to the story. This is truly an original coming-of-age tales that deserves numerous readings.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is that rare kind of book that sticks with you long after you've finished reading it. I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this one. It truly does have something for everyone.cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this one.

I'm so happy to finally see his work released in the mass market format. This is one author who deserves a wider audience. Comparable to Stewart O'Nan, Piccirilli's writing is always beautiful, always lyrical and very deep. Unfortunately, A Choir of Ill Children, the sad and poetic tale of a young tormented soul, just isn't Piccirilli's best effort yet.<br />The story centers around a young man who has had more than his share of troubles in his life. His father killed himself, his mother disappeared and is still missing, and he is still haunted by horrible dreams and some horrible events of his past. His brothers, conjoined triplets, have powerful minds and thoughts. And everyone in the small town of Kingdom Come is hiding something under the surface. There are just too many dark secrets for this little town.<br />As the dark forces try to avenge the past, Thomas has to deal with his own ghosts, the ones inhabiting his mind. The fact that everyone arounds him seems to be on his case doesn't help matters either. The novel is at its best when Piccirilli brings us into Thomas's past or when he describes some of Thomas's dreams. Those scenes just feel surreal and disturbing, leaving the reader to feel completely uneasy.<br />The story meanders without aim for too long. Although you get to know these characters very well, you never actually feel close to any of them. All of this brings us to the heavy finale, where too many things seem to happen all at once. Everything just explodes and, once again, moves aimlessly towards the finish.<br />That said, A Choir of Ill Children's prose is so powerful, so gripping that you forget about its flaws. Piccirilli has a way of reeling you in and making you want to keep on reading. There is a lot of sadness in these words, the pages are drenched in regret. Superstitions abound, and dark gothic magic comes to play a role in the narrative.<br />I admired the book for thequality of its prose and for the way in which Piccirilli weaves his narrative so seamlessly. But I think, in the end, I just wanted more out of these characters.	2004-07-18

But in the hands of Augusten Burroughs, who followed this book by writing two brilliant memoirs that found laughter in the saddest and most extraordinary situations, satire becomes a child's trick.<br />The book follows the ups and downs of the people working at Sellevision, the nation's newest television phenomena. Sellevision is a home shopping network with class. Or so they'd want you to believe. But judging from the people who work there, you have to ask yourself serious questions.<br />First off, Max is fired from his job after accidentally exposing his manly assetts on live television. Max doesn't know what he wants to do with his life now that he's jobless. And numerous job interviews lead him to believe that there is nothing else for him out there, until he finds the one avenue that will leave him satisfied in many ways.<br />Then there is Peggy, the host with a stalker. Her stalker problem and her unhappy life leads her towards the bottle and turns her into a Proza addict. Soon enough, her neurotic personality lands her into a detox centre.<br />Or what about Leigh, who places a personal ad and meets her perfect match (who just happens to be a millionaire)? Or the young host who is having a relation with her married boss? Or what about the other five or six characters that so well colors the pages of this novel.<br />The story itself would not have been much without Burroughs's wit and sadistic humour. He's able to take small banal portions of every day life and turn them into complete laugh riots. He's able to make you laugh even under the most strangest or saddest situations. <br />Sellevision is a one-of-a-kind read. Not only is Burroughs talented when it comes to writing memoirs, but he's a great writer of fiction as well. Sellevision will leave you laughing and smiling until you can't smile anymore. There aren't too many books with that quality on the shelves right now.	2004-07-09

Scott Heim's Mysterious Skin is a coming of age tale that holds nothing back. It's a fearless and unpretentious effort that will leave you breathless.<br />The book's complex narrative takes us through the minds of various characters (the novel is told in first person, using different characters to tell different parts of the story). The story starts when Brian and Neil are young boys. Although they are on the same baseball team, they do not know each other. Something happens to them that will mark them forever. <br />They both find different ways to deal with the event that left them mentally scarred. Many years later, Brian is certain that his blackouts and frequent nose bleeds can only be attributed to the fact that he was abducted by aliens. But as he grows older, the horrible truth slowly reveals itself to him and he quickly realizes that he needs to find Neil in order to put it all behind him. <br />Neil, on his part, deals with his past in a very different way. Working as an escort, Neil doesn't always know what he wants. He is a very reluctant character in that he thinks he knows who he is what he wants when, in fact, he's a complete stranger to himself. The only way he can find to deal with everything life hands him is through his body and his sexuality.<br />Offering very complex characters with even more complicated lives, Mysterious Skin is a powerful read that you won't be able to put down. The pain these characters feel just oozes off the page, affecting the reader in various ways. Just wait until Neil and Brian finally meet. Their confrontation is completely heartbreaking. It's almost impossible not to feel for these characters, almost impossible not to sympathize and empathize with them.<br />Mysterious Skin was Scott Heim's first novel. I can't wait to discover more from this writer. Mysterious Skin really leftan impression on me. Highly recommended.	2004-07-05

After The Beach and The Tesseract, Garland worked on the amazing horror flick 28 Days Later. The Coma, a short novella that is, like everything else Garland has written, not easily classifiable. This ends up being the novel's forte and also its biggest flaw.<br />While trying to help a woman who is being attacked on a subway, Carl is beaten to a bloody pulp and left for dead. A long while later, he wakes up from the coma the attack left him in and returns home. But he soon realizes that nothing is as it used to be. Things have changed, things are wrong, things are just unexplainable. Time seems to be moving faster, Carl finds himself moving from one place to another without remembering having done so. And how about those invisible bleeding wounds on his body?<br />Garland weaves his narrative just like a dream. One second we're standing in one place, the next we're in a total different setting. Things are disjointed and they don't always make sense for the reader. Until, that is, something crucial is revealed to us that changes the way we see or understand the events taking place in the narrative.<br />Told in the first person over very short chapters, with interesting visual images to guide us through the story, The Coma is a story that is both imaginary and frighteningly real. As always, Garland lets his imagination run wild to create a one-of-a-kind trip to the human psyche.<br />Then again, the book left me craving for more. I wanted more out of Carl, wanted to learn more from the characters and the situations they were in. Over the course of two very short chapters, Garland tells us a bit about Carl's childhood, but not enough to eradicate my curiosity. Some sections could have been fleshed out a bit more. It's rare that you'll want more out of a story. These days, most book should listen to the 'less is more' rule. But The Coma is an exception to the rule. <br />As it stands, The Coma is a very fastread that you'll probably want to read again. An original read that will leave you craving for more.	2004-06-27

This is high octane suspense at its very possible best. Who cares if the book is far-fetched and the characters not very likeable. There is enough suspense and intrigue trapped within these four hundred pages to keep you reading way past your bedtime.<br />Adam is in a tight bind. His present employer has just found out that he's embezzled a small amount of money for his own personal use. But instead of sending Adam to jail, Wyatt, the leader of a high-tech company, asks him to become a company spy. Adam will have to get a job at Trion Corporation in order to find all that he can about their new projects.<br />Adam is a smooth talker, a great liar and a great actor. In no time, he finds himself working at Trion and, within just a few weeks, he's working for the CEO himself as a personal assistant. Adam quickly realizes how grueling spy work can be. Although he wants to make amends with Wyatt and clear his name with his old company, his newfound love for his new boss and his love for his new company soon affect the way he sees things. He even feels guilt after a while. <br />Finder is a master at building suspense. The book's title is all too appropriate for this story because Adam quickly becomes paranoid himself, always looking over his shoulder and wondering who is after him, who is trying to put a stop to his plan, who knows his true identity. There are many obstacles in his way, notably a woman he falls in love with when he's supposed to be spying on her, and his friendship with his new boss. And the fact that some start seeing right through his plans make Adam even more nervous.<br />Written in short chapters, the book is a frantic high-tech intrigue written for the average reader. You don't need to know a lot about computers or big corporations to understand this one; Finder simplifies everything for the reader and never eternalizes himself on unimportant details. In other words, he's not taking the Michael Crichton route, opting to give his readers just what they need instead of assaulting them with too much information about the tech world.<br />Although Adam was a great character to follow, I have to admit that there aren't many likeable characters in Paranoia. But since the reader also becomes paranoid as the story progresses, wondering who's being truthful and who isn't, who's an ally and who isn't, I guess this tactique is quite fitting for the story.<br />This is a great beach novel that should please fans of the suspense and mystery genres. There is enough intrigue here to fully flesh out three novels. Finder somehow finds a way to cram it all into one book, thus creating an enthralling and very entertaining read.	2004-06-26

I can't believe there is one book left in the Dark Tower series. This is King's epic (actually, I think there is no word to decribe the scope of what he's accomplished with this book). But this might very well be the most challenging and daring book in the series yet. Because this time, all bets are off. King does something with the Dark Tower that could very well confuse some readers, but which should awe almost everyone. Hate it or love it, you'll still be highly interested in what King is doing here.<br />The book picks up where The Wolves of the Calla left off. Susannah has returned to 1999. She is still pregnant and her mind is still being held hostage by the phantom Mia. Roland and his ka-tet have to reopen the door and leave The Calla in order to return to Susannah and save her from a pregnancy that could very well kill her.<br />When they cross, Roland and Eddie are taken back to the 70s where they meet Tower to try and convince him to sell that lot where the rose is growing. But the most interesting thing here is that Roland and Eddie also confront a man named Stephen King, the very writer who is writing the book of their lives. Yes, King has written himself in the novel in a gutso twist that only intensifies and mystifies the book's power.<br />Meanwhile, Susannah is trying to face Mia and control the pregnancy. Over the years, King has become interested with the human psyche. Once again, we find scenes where Susannah is trapped within the walls and rooms of her own mind. My only real complaint with the book is that King keeps Jake and Pere Callahan away from the story for much too long. They only appear near the end of the book and they aren't given much to do at all.<br />The book ends on a jawbreaker finale that will leave you begging for more. This installment is lean and brilliantly written. King once again plays with space and time to create a world (or worlds) that are unique and distinct. The pacing is so frantic that you'll finish the book in no time.<br />The Dark Tower series has become something of a self-reflection for King. The book finishes with journals of the author himself. The fact that he has made himself a prominant character in the story still amazes me. I can't read what the last book has in store for us. But I also can't help feeling a bit sad because the series will be ending very soon. Too soon.	2004-06-15

He moves back to his hometown of Dry Wells and takes a job as a radio host in the hopes of finding redemption and maybe even solace. But on his very first night on the air, Callahan receives a call from a distressed young woman who just wants to talk. He quickly becomes uneasy with the conversation and stops it just as his show ends. Then, on his way home, Callahan finds the body of a dead man lying in the street.<br />Days later, the daughter of the richest man in town is murdered. Was she the young girl who called his show? And who in the small town of Dry Wells can be trusted? Well, no one it seems, save for one young man who befriends Callahan and helps him in his investigation. Of course, Callahan quickly becomes a suspect himself and must uncover the town's darks secrets before it is too late. This is the kind of scenario where everyone is a suspect. The impeding feel of paranoia grabs you by the gut and doesn't let go of you until the very last page.<br />I will not say any more about the book because I do not want to ruin a completely, all-around enjoyable read. What I will say is that Callahan was one of my favorite characters in years; he can be compared to Chandler's Marlowe or Connelly's Harry Bosch. And Shannon's style never tires. His book always have this frantic quality to them that makes you keep on turning the pages way past your bedtime. His characters are vivid, realistic and always flawed, something I wish more authors could make use of. <br />I've already read Memorial Day twice. I can't wait to read the next Callahan  novel, or Shannon's next for that matter. Do yourself a favor and discover one of the most entertaining new voice in genre fiction. It's been a while since we've had the chance to encounter such an original voice. Shannon's future seems very bright indeed.	2004-06-02

I remember reading the very first Harry Potter book many years ago and being completely taken in by the story's imaginative and completely original premise. The series has not disappointed me since. Now that the third film is just around the corner, I thought it would do me good to go back to the series' third book to rediscover its magic all over again.<br />Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favorites from the series. This time, Harry returns to Hogwarts for his third year only to learn a terrible piece of news. A man named Sirius Black, who just happens to be Harry's Godfather, has escaped the prison of Azkaban. Believed to be a very dangerous murderer, many think that Black is going to try Harry the moment he gets the chance. The readers get to learn a great deal about Harry's past and about his parents. And, as in all the Potter books, the truth isn't always what it first appears to be...<br />But Harry, as the series has thought us, isn't easily frazzled. Although his third year is disturbed by Black's escape (creatures called the Dementors, the dark and violent creatures that guard the Azkaban prison roam the school grounds, the constant threat of not knowing where Black truly is...), there is a lot more Harry needs to worry about. First of all, he wants to win the Quiddich cup. He wants to visit Hogsmeade, the only wizard town in England. And he also wants to help Hagrid save one of his mystical creature that is supposed to be executed by the end of the school year. And he still needs to study and attend all of his classes in order to graduate, even when the amount of work becomes unbearable. And, scariest of all, he still has to deal with Professor Snape's hatred. <br />A series of new characters are introduced. We have the new wacky teacher of Diviniation, as well as Lupin, the new Dark Arts teacher (and one of my favorite characters in the book). And all the regulars we have come to love and cherish are back for one more round. <br />This is a darker and scarier effort from Rowling's part. There are a many very intense scenes that lead to the incredible finale. It still amazes me to see how much imagination and wit Rowling has. Her books are so vividly written and so brilliantly executed that there isn't a great deal to dislike about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (or the series in its entirety for that matter). I can't to see the movie and can't wait to read the next installment in this incredible series.	2004-05-31
US	49059365	R2WE2YLOIYT0ZE	0765307057	380470964	Midnight Mass	Books	2	7	10	N	N	And then?	In his introduction to Midnight Mass, F. Paul Wilson explains that this story came to him in order to bring the vampire genre back to its horror roots (ie, away from the Anne Rice type and closer to King's Salems' Lot). But is the novel worth reading? I really had to trudge through this one. The story is filled with unsympathetic characters, predictable plot lines and pages after pages of boring exposition. In the end, Midnight Mass doesn't rejuvenate the vampire genre, it just makes it feel even more tired.<br />Father Joe Cahill is one of the few survivors of the Apocalypse. Vampires have taken over the earth and very few humans are left alive. And the ones who are are too terrified to try and stand against the new terror. When Joe returns to his parish after a long absence, he joins Sister Carol and his niece Lacey in trying to build a rebellion against the figures of the night.<br />It doesn't help at all that these characters feel like cardboard cutouts of better, more fleshed out people. If only Wilson could have given these characters a real history and purpose, this story would have been much stronger. We need to care for at least one character in order to make a story successful and engrossing for the reader. <br />Halfway through the novel, a plot twist occurs that is supposed to shock the reader and drive the story in a completely new direction. But none of it really surprised me. In fact, this plot twist was so obvious that I was disappointed to see Wilson make use of it.<br />And the vampires are also unoriginal and uninteresting. They are protected during the daytime by groups of men dressed in cowboy outfits. These men are supposed to be terrifying, but they drop quicker than flies. The vampires, on their part, aren't a big threat either; they all seem tame even if Wilson tries hard to make them terrifying. <br />In the end, Midnight Mass was a big disappointment. Wilson is capable of much better. I am a fast reader, but it took me a great deal to finish this one. I really hope that, one of these days, an author WILL write a vampire novel that WILL bring us back to the greatness of Salem's Lot, where the horrors seem to jump right off the page. As it stands, Midnight Mass isn't even close to that kind of greatness. Very little scare and very little originality makes a dud in my book. I guess I'll just have to go back to the Repairman Jack novels to remind myself of what Wilson is really capable.	2004-05-20
US	49059365	R16SGE1LQ6SOQG	0316155977	561654368	The Narrows (Book & Special Free DVD)	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Welcome back Backus	In The Narrows, Michael Connelly brings back his most vicious and original killer to date, an ex-FBI agent named Backus aka The Poet.  And in the process, Connelly invites his favourite character, Harry Bosch, to investigate the killer. Some old faces, like Terry McCaleb and Rachel from The Poet are also brought back to put an end to the Poet's vicious crimes. <br />Although The Narrows is far from achieving the levels of suspense found in The Poet, the book is still a very tense and very entertaining read. And I think Connelly is getting softer with time (a quality that might do his novels a lot of good); while The Poet was drowning in gruesome murders, the deaths in The Narrows happen off the page. Actually, there are very few deaths that happen during the course of The Narrows and yet, Connelly creates great suspense and a lot of mystery for the reader. The finaly 50 pages are a breathless thrill ride that will make you bite your nails down to the flesh. <br />I loved the fact that Connelly chose to tell the story both in the first person (for Bosch, a technique he began using with last year's Lost Light) and in the third person (for Rachel and Backus). The novel begins as Bosch is asked by the wife of the recently-deceased McCaleb to investigate his death. Little does he know that his investigation will bring him to The Poet. He eventually teams up with Rachel even though the FBI doesn't want Bosch on the investigation. <br />His search brings him to Las Vegas where The Poet has left his latest string of victims buried in the middle of the desert. But eventually, Bosch returns to his home turf of LA to try and put an end to the Poet's reing. <br />Filled with great suspense, compelling and interesting characters and a very orignal premise, The Narrows is everything a Michael Connelly novel should be. This isn't and doesn't feel like a tired sequel. Instead, its a completely new adventure that has enough twists and turns to keep you reading well past the wee hours of the morning. Even after all these books, Bosch is still a fresh and very distinct characters. Connelly really is this generation's great suspense writer.	2004-05-10

It's not even a question&quot; and ends with &quot;Just remember, everything I've told you is true. I'm completely innocent. Try to be nice to me, okay? Just tell a good story.&quot; Those words are spoken by Marjorie, the troubled heroine (if you can call her that...) of O'Nan's novel. <br />Marjorie is on death row, telling her story to a recorder for a Stephen King-like writer while awaiting her execution. Marjorie was found guilty of murdering eight people, including a cop, while on a murder spree with her husband Lamont and her friend Natalie. But do not call her a serial killer because, although she was present when the murders occurred, the circumstances  revolving around them might or might not make an innocent out of her.<br />During the course of the novel, Marjorie tells us her whole story, from her childhood until the day she meets Lamont. She tells us how she met Natalie and how their strange relationship led to the grisly murders. She even tells us about her innocent baby boy and how he had to witness some of the murders they committed.<br />You could call The Speed Queen a cross-breed between Natural Born Killers and Badlands. But it is Marjorie's truthfulness that makes this one fresh and different. She is such a well-drawn character that you can't help but like her, no matter what she has done. You even feel sorry for her at times. This novel is so well written that its realistic tone and feel will send shivers crawling down your whole body. <br />Stewart O'Nan has written a tour de force that will stay with you long after you've turned the last page. O'Nan's writing is sharp, witty and full of dark humour. This is an hypnotic read you won't be able to put down.	2004-05-05

Well, you won't after reading this amazing and surprising debut novel that knocked me off my feet. This is that rare gut-wrenching novel that will leave your yearning for more. I cannot believe that this is Mary Relindes Ellis's first novel because The Turtle Warrior displays the maturity and skill that only a veteran could hold. <br />The story begins when Bill is an eight year old boy who wants only one thing; to please his big brother Jimmy (the novel opens with a beautiful passage that tells us right off the bat what these two characters really are about). But when Jimmy leaves for Nam to fight in the war, Bill is left alone with his abusive father and his sadness-torn mother. He has very little recourse to escape all the abuse and the tears. The only thing he has are his brother's letters.<br />But when his brother goes MIA, Bill is no longer able to escape the harsh reality of his life. He can't even find solace in his next-door neighbours, a couple who could never have children and who have adopted the two boys as their own. These two are more like parents to Bill and Jimmy than their real parents ever were.<br />The novel then jumps forward in time to present Jimmy as a teenager. And then as an adult. But the novel never loses its focus, nor does it deviates from its main purpose; to describe, in details, the power of human emotions.<br />Told from various point of views, the novel meanders through the lives of these numerous characters, until we get to know them all too well. When Bill starts drinking heavily - the only way he knows to escape his life - and threatens to become his father's spit image, the reader never hates the boy. We can only care for him because of all the tragedy he has been able to survive. And I have to say that I loved the fact that the only character who does not speak in the first person in this novel is Bill. He is presented through the eyes of others, a sad boy who is misunderstood by most. <br />The Turtle Warrior was such a great read that, right after finishing the novel, I went back and re-read some passages. Its lyrical and powerful prose and its realistic and flawed characters only add another layer of greatness to the narrative. I bought this book because of its beautiful cover, and now I hope everyone will run out and give this one a chance.	2004-05-01

On one side, you have the more visceral and violent kind. On the other, you have the more quiet and emotional one. The Night Country, an amazingly affective novel, falls into this second category. Written with much soul and emotion, it's a nearly poetic treatise about the sadness of death and the sadness of life.<br />The story takes place a year after a horrible car crash that left four teenagers dead, one badly injured and one unharmed. Now, a year later, the ghosts of the departed ones look at the world and the people who used to matter in their lives. It is now the eve of Halloween, the day when, one year ago, the accident happened. We follow these characters for twenty-four hours, until the very tragic end of the story. <br />The story follows many different subplots that all merge into one. You have Brookes, the cop who was the first to arrive at the scene of the accident and who has been badly scarred by it ever since. You have Tim, the only one who survived unharmed and who hasn't been able to deal with the event. And you have Kyle, who survived the crash but who was left damaged in more ways than one, and his parents.<br />As our narrator, the late Marco, tells us what happens to these characters, the other ghosts often argue with him or come in to tell us their brief version of things. O'Nan weaves his narrative in such a way that you never quite know where the book is taking you. Well, you know where it is trying to go although you wish it will never get there.<br />The Night Country is a book that is all about death. There is very little joy to be found in this story. Instead, what you find is sadness. These characters are too badly scarred to ever be able to mend their lives back into what they used to be. <br />Powerful, touching and incredibly affective, The Night Country is that rare horror novels that achieves greatness on many levels. You will not soon forget these characters, nore will you forget this powerful tale of mourning without hope. O'Nan has just found himself a new fan. I can't wait to read his other books!	2004-04-22

Others are written for the sole purpose of entertainment. The Codex falls in this second category. While the story does offer a lot of thrills - moving very fast through time and offering a lot of action and adventure, everything suited for a no-brainer Hollywood flick - I can't admit that it will ever become a classic adventure tale. Still, I had a great time reading The Codex despite of all its flaws, and I'm sure you will as well.<br />The Broadbent brothers reunite at their father's home only to be learn a horrible news. It seems that their father, a rich art and artifact collector, has taken his whole fortune and buried it deep within the jungles somewhere in the world. Buried with him  is an old Mayan codex that will bring riches to anyone that lays their hands on it. The brothers will have to travel halfway across the world and face unimaginable hardships in order to retrieve their father's treasures and the codex.<br />The problem is, their father's ex-partner, an evil man named Hauser, learns about the codex and decides to partake in the search of Broadbent's grave in order to sell the document to some big medical corporation. Hauser will let nothing and no one stand in his way. <br />Written in short chapters and direct, unpretentious prose, The Codex is a perfect beach novel; it's often impossible to put it down. It doesn't matter that all the chracters are cardboard cutouts, beause this story knows how to deliver the goods. Hauser is the kind of evil man we've seen in a million Hollywood flicks. The brothers are differentiated not through dialogue or personality, but by the use of very generic characteristics (the religous one, the rich one who only wants to get richer, and the &quot;perfect&quot; one who usually thinks of others before thinking of himself). I usually hate novels where the characters are this prototypical, but somehow, in Preston's hands, it all works out in the end. The book is filled with so much action and suspense that you tend to forget this major flaw.<br />The Codex is a far cry from the books Preston has written with his partner Lincoln Child. But I have to admit that I preferred this solo effort than the one Child offered last summer (Utopia). I don't think I'll remember what The Codex was about a year from now. At least I'll remember that I had a great time reading it.	2004-04-17

After having read this thin novel, I have to admit that I found very little freshness in it, and was far from enthralled with the story. <br />Erast is a young Russian police officer who, as he's still in the early parts of his career, comes face to face with a cross-nation intrigue that could very well result in his death. From Russia, he travels to London and other European countries to stop a beautiful woman from sending total havoc across the nations. <br />Erast has more lives than a cat. Every time he ends up in a situation he can't possibly get himself out of, someone (or some divine intervention) comes and saves his life. By the end, you never really do feel as if the character's in danger because you know that, the moment danger shows its dirty nose, he'll find some way to get out of the mess he placed himself in.<br />I have to admit that I was truly disappointed by The Winter Queen. I had heard great things about this book and, sadly, I have to admit that it did not live up to my expectations. The prose is flowery and often laughable, and the story often stalls when characters go through long moments of unnecessary exposition (do we really need another character to tell us everything that happened when we were ablet to connect the dots by ourselves?)<br />Maybe I'll have to give this one another try one of these days. As it stands now, The Winter Queen is a very plain and uneventful read that just didn't grab my attention.	2004-04-11

You will see, in details, what it takes to make an already tortured soul cross the line to completely immerse himself into madness. The book is dark and very violent. I don't think I can say that I really enjoy reading all of it. But like Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door, this is one book that uses words and realism to create power and terror.<br />Ben is 23 years old and never had a girlfriend. Everything about life seems to make him tick; girls, his friends and especially his parents. He can't seem to find happiness, no matter how hard he tries. Girls never approach him and, when he does find the courage to approach them, they discard him like a piece of trash.<br />When Ben finally meets Christine, a young librarian, he thinks that their love will be forever. But only too soon, Christine realizes how deeply troubled Ben is. Fear takes the better of her, and that rage that's always boiling within Ben finally rises to the surface.<br />Ben buys a gun and... Well, I'll leave the rest for you to read. I'll just say that the final climax is highly disturbing and not for everyone. This isn't an Agatha Christie thriller folks. This is realistic horror at its more visceral.  <br />Althgough the writing can be a bit tedious at times (some section needed to be elaborated a bit more, while others ran on for a bit too long), Ben's descent into madness is one of the more realistic things I've read in a long while. This is the kind of real-life scenario that has the power to send violent shudders down your spine. This is what horror is all about.<br />Did I like Rage? Yes and no. Some scenes were a bit too extreme for my taste. Did I admire it? Yes. This is the kind of book that is bound to shock and make people talk. Still, reading it is somewhat enlightening for the reader. In the end, you'll be even more aware of the real-life horrors that surround us. But is that a good thing? Well, the jury is still out on that one...	2004-04-02

I picked up James Frey's biography expecting it to be just like every other; preachy and feel good, trying too hard to get its moral across. But A Million Little Pieces is much, much more than that. <br />A Million Little Pieces tells the story of James Frey, who became addicted to alcohol when he was ten years old and to drugs just a few years later. After a drunken frenzy, he wakes up in a plane with no recollection of what happened to him. When the plane lands, his parents pick him up at the airport to bring him to a detox centre.<br />James spends the next month of his life trying to deal with his addiction and trying to make amends with his past. James goes through a week of hell as his system tries to get used to this new life of sobriety. The things he describe in the book sent shivers down my back and made me cringe with horror. An accident before going to the detox centre left him with his teeth broken and his cheek torn open; the ordeal of getting his teeth fixed (without any anaesthetics) is one of the most horrific things I've ever read.<br />In detox, James meets a man named Leonard, a mob boss who takes James under his wing and makes sure that he sobers up properly. He also befriends an ex boxer and a couple of hard-edged guys, as well as an alcoholic judge. He also meets Lilly, another patient with a similar history (...).  <br />The thing that makes this story stand out is Frey himself. His character is strong but stubborn. His writing is swift, sometimes funny, sometimes horrifying. I can't imagine any human being soundly surviving everything he goes through during the span of this book. But he does. And Frey always gives his readers a little bit of sunshine. Although (...). <br />I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of biographies. But this one was totally inspiring. It brought me to a place I never thought I'd visit and, for a time, it almost felt as if I was right there with James, going through what he was going through. The section of the book where he tries to reconnect with his parents was particularly affecting. <br />A Million Little Pieces is the kind of book that will bring some changes in you. Although the writing isn't always incredible, the story itself will grab you by the gut, disturbing and comforting you all at the same time. It is a great biography that I will surely come back to in a near future.	2004-03-28

If you ever wondered what happens to a body when it dies, if you ever wondered what kind of research is being done on corpses, if you ever wondered what happens if you &quot;donate&quot; your body to science, then this is the book for you. If any of these topics sent a shiver down your spine (or did much worst), then I advise you to stay far away from this one.<br />The real charm of the book is that, while being very informative and straight to the point, Roach's writing is often humorous in a morbid way that often brought a smile to my lips. She remarks some things that I would never had even thought of and makes some jokes that, done by any other author, could have seem tasteless (in fact, her humour is what makes this book such a fascinating read). <br />There wasn't a single chapter in this little tome that I didn't find fascinating, but some stood out more than others. In How To Know If You're Dead, Roach examines the different theories about the human soul to try and locate its presence (is it in the heart? the brain? the liver?). In Beyond the Black Box, she explains what happens to someone who is victim of a plane crash and how experts determine the cause of the crash. In Lifer After Death, Roach explains the different stages of decomposition. And in Just A Head, Roach examines the very strange subject of decapitation. <br />If this all sounds morbid, well, it is. But Roach's book is so well researched and informative that it all goes down easy for the reader. Roach never shies away from the truth, no matter how gruesome it may get. <br />Is this one for everyone? Not nearly. The topic will put off some, while the vivid imagery with turn off many others. But if you have the heart (and stomach) to take this one in, the ride will make you discover things you never knew about death, and will confirm or finally put to rest other assumptions you could have.	2004-03-21

He did the impossible when he translated the very poetic and cahotic The English Patient to the screen, and he did worders with a little gem called The Talented Mr Ripley (in my opinion, one of the best thrillers made during this last decade). Now Minghella tries his hands at translating the epic journey that is Cold Mountain to the screen and succeeds... somewhat.<br />To really appreciate a film like Cold Mountain, you need it all; the script, the actors, the set, the costumes, the locations, the score... Everything has to be balanced just right in order to achieve greatness. Some have complained that the movie is shallow because you never truly feel the love between our star-crossed lovers. But I think that's the whole point of the story. Inman is really in love with the idea of a woman he has known for a very brief time, and Ida loves the idea of that man. Is it true love? I don't think so. What these characters need is to cling on to each other in order to survive the ordeals they are facing.<br />Cold Mountain was a very big and busy book. Minghella needed to do choices when he adapted the story, cutting down what he deemed not as important. And I think the choices he made were the right ones. The story flows quite nicely and never stalls. <br />But the real thing that drives this movie are the performances.  The script might seem a bit stiff on the page, but an epic story is about the whole of it all. Minghella did wonders with a book that must have been very hard to adapt for modern audiences, and succeeded quite nicely.	2004-03-21

These four novellas - one new and three previously published - demonstrate the skills and talent of an author who is bound for greatness.<br />Lebbon loves to write post-apocalyptic tale, and this collection features one of his most popular end-of-the-world stories, Naming of the Parts. Here, a young boy and his parents try to escape a civilisation that has gone mad. The dead are walking and there is nowhere to hide. <br />In The Unfortunate, Lebbon gives us the very, very original tale of a man who, after being the sole survivor of a plane crash, is forever changed. But his survival isn't a mere coincidence or a stroke of good luck. Soon enough, he finds himself in the middle of a very dark game that will leave him scarred for the rest of his life. The ending will haunt your for a very long time.<br />Since the stories in this collection were written in the earlier parts of Lebbon's career, it's somewhat of a disappointment to realize that the newest and previously unpublished tale in this collection is also the lesser of the four. In Remnant, a man meets his archologist friend in a deserted land to uncover a forgotten civilisation that has been laying dormant for thousands of years. The story is a bit slow, and the finale anticlimactic.<br />But the real reason to read this collection is for the magnificent, terrifying and brilliantly written White. In this tale, the world is dying and becoming a sea of white snow. A group of people trapped inside a mansion soon realize that this new whiteness also hides something dark and violent, something that his destroying them one by one. This is one story you won't be able to put down. I read White quite a while back when it was first published and, upon numerous readings, it now stands as one of my all-time horror faves.<br />This is a great collection that should not be missed. Lebbon is bound to become a very important voice in genre fiction. Fears Unnamed is sure to give your lots of thrills, chills and a load of good times.	2004-03-17

I was eagerly awaiting Laimo's next novel, and now that I've read Deep in the Darkness, I'm happy to report that Atmosphere was no fluke. With this novel, Laimo will leave his mark on the horror genre as a great new voice in the horror field.<br />When Doctor Michael Cayle moves into the small town of Ashborough with his wife Christine and daughter Jessica, he thinks that this move is for the best. Bringing his young family away from the big city seems to be just the right thing to do. So he moves into town, taking the practice of the recently departed doctor and hopes for the best.<br />Unfortunately, everything that goes wrong does and, soon enough, Michael seems to be standing knee-deep in a nightmare come true. Nothing is at it seems in Ashborough. Secrets is the only rule of the game. Something dwells in the woods, something old, something that rules the town with its darkness. What seems to be nothing more than a legend at first turns out to be the horrible reality. Soon enough, Michael and his family are trapped in a nightmare so horrible, so terrifying that their very lives are being threatened.<br />Giving too much of the plot away would be ruining a great and completely satisfying read. I loved every single minute of Deep in the Darkness. The suspense seems to peak on every page, and the characters never feel false to the reader. But the greatest thing about this one is Laimo's writing. The author has a way of reeling his reader in, until he's cornerned with no means of escape. The writing feels natural and effortless.<br />Laimo is able to involve his readers in the very story. Note a certain scene where the main character commits his first deed to the things living in the woods. That section had my skin crawling with shivers. And the ending? I had to read the last two hundred pages in onesitting. The suspense never ends. <br />I can easily see this one becoming a great horror flick in the near future. If you haven't tried Laimo already, this is the perfect time for you to do so. Laimo is sure to quickly climb to the top of his game, where great genre writers like Stephen King and Douglas Clegg reside. Not to be missed!	2004-03-13
US	49059365	R3BMXBFSTFGIM6	0671741039	907356964	Swan Song	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Apocalyptic Fears	There are many post-apocalyptic tales out there, most of them too familiar, most of them feeling like they are one and the same. It seems that the topic has been touched upon so many times that it lost its ability to terrify or shock the reader. Upon re-reading McCammon's Swan Song, I was comforted to realize that the book has stood the test of time and that this story is still very much terrifying and effective.<br />An evil force has turned the earth into a deadland after a series of nuclear attacks. Very few have survived, and many of the ones who have lost their good sense during the ordeal. <br />The novel follows the story of three groups of survivors, which will eventually meet in the end for the novel's bloody finale. First, we find Josh, an ex-wrestler, and Swan, a young girl with the power of life. Then, we have Sister, a bag lady who finds a second life after the big bang, and the men who follow her in her trek to find the young girl. And finally, we have Roland, a young boy who's soul is dark and thirsty for blood. McCammon has found an amazing way to differentiate his &quot;good&quot; characters from the &quot;evil&quot; one, a technique I will let you discover by yourself. <br />Swan tries to put the life back into the earth, but many people try to stop her from creating life. Roland forms and army that seeks destruction, while that evil force wants to see both Sister and Swan dead.<br />The ordeals these characters go through will instill enough nightmares in you to last you a lifetime. Although the novel is lengthy (nearly 1000 pages), it remains a very fast read that you won't want to put down. This story is very original and very effective. Whenever you think the story will bring you in one direction, it veers and takes a completely different one. There are many surprises in Swan Song, some pleasant, but many of them dark. <br />I'm surprised that this one never find the same level of success as King's The Stand. Although the topic and tone are similar, the stories are as different as night and day. In McCammon's story, the lead characters are few, and you get to know them fairly well by the end of the novel. <br />And the book's final moment? Well, let's just say that the nail-biting suspense will keep you reading until the wee hours of the morning. This is a horror classic that needs to be discovered and rediscovered by all.	2004-03-10

The physical and intellectual harm that is inflicted on the young recruits shouldn't be allowed (and tradition shouldn't be an excuse).<br />Reading Brad Land's Goat is like being one of those pledges, suffering through days and days of anguish and harm. And for what? To be part of a fraternity for a year or two? <br />Land wrote his fictionalized memoir in the first person and present tense, which often creates unease in the reader. Because you are right there with Land as he tries to please his brothers in order to gain a place in the fraternity. But the fact that Land was also brutally beaten only a couple of years before the hazing begun only makes this tale scarier; the amount of fear and torment this man is making himself suffer through never ceased to amaze me. The past is always there haunting him, and now the present also become a living nightmare. <br />In a way, Land is trying to amend for the past by pledging to this fraternity. His younger brother, who is now part of the fraternity he's pledging to , does little to ease Land's initiation. As a matter of fact, his brother often appears cold and and maybe even a bit lifeless. <br />We never really know what drives Land to go through the whole process. Often terrifying and full of anguish, this small memoir won't leave anyone feeling indifferent in the end. A very powerful read.	2004-02-18

The book's narrative is quite simple and yet completely gripping. Although it does have a few problems, in the end, this one was a completely original ride that I would take again. <br />Set in Ottawa (Canada) in 1997 and early 1998, the novel is centred around Harriet, a woman who's love for old movies is now dictating her life. There is nothing she loves more than to discuss movies (who was the best actor? Peter O'Toole or Cary Grant? Sean Connery or Marlon Brando? Was Katherine Hepburn really a great actress?) Her love for the old Hollywood is so intense that it now rules her life and even threatens her marriage.<br />As Harriet trudges through the days of the ice storm and the teacher's strike, socializing with her best (and only) friend Dinah, and struggling with her marriage and children, as well as suffering from insomnia and cronic fatigue, the only thing that keeps her going is her love for movies. And when she has no one to talk to, she writes letters that she never mails to the late critic Pauline Kael, whom she never met (though she talks about her as if she was a close friend).<br />You can't help but feel sorry for Harriet, even when she acts completely insane. She is a lonely woman who has no one to talk to. No one really understands her, which forces her to withdraw to the world of magic and fantasy that is Hollywood, the only place that really makes her happy. But the only problem is that she is sometimes undermined by Hay's cold writing style. Hay never really lets you get close to her characters. The moment things get emotionally heavy, she seems to withdraw herself from the narrative. Just like the characters in this book, Hay seems afraid to face any real emotional situations.<br />Garbo Laughs isn't a great book. But Hay's sarcastic sense of humour and her very vivid characters make this one a very entertaining read. This novel seems to have been written for anyone whostill loves the old Hollywood, when movies always ended on a perfect note, where romance seemed to be the only rule in the book. Too bad Hay followed those old rules a bit too closely. This story feels just a bit too simple for these complicated times.	2004-02-16

Although the book is centered around a premise that would only appear in that genre, Train is a mystery thriller without any mystery. Instead, it is about the way characters are affected by situations that are way beyond their means and understanding.<br />Train is a seventeen year old black boy who knows nothing but hardship. Growing up in a time of racial inequity, Train faces the very same prejudice every day. He works as a caddy at a golf course, getting nothing but a few bucks a week. When two of the caddies working at the same golf course brutally attack a woman, killing her husband in the process, Train is fired from his job and left on the street.<br />As the story progresses, the novel follows Train as he finds a new job on another golf course. The novel also follows the woman who was brutally attacked and who falls in love with the cop who saved her, and the cop who only lives one way: on the edge.<br />Great characters entertwine in this complex narrative that never ceases to impress. Dexter's writing is often funny (some of his every-day observations made me laugh out loud quite a few times, especially one concerning eggs and chicken), and often dark. Dexter uses elegant prose while telling the story of the rich woman, and slang and bad grammar when telling Train's story, which only adds to the characters's complexity.<br />Dexter uses characters that are broken beyond repair to tell an otherwise simple story. Train is the kind of innocent, naive character who is just awaiting his awakening. He goes through life accepting what he sees without really questioning anything. He encounters these various characters (also including a blind man and slew of rich golf players) with indifference. When he finally finds a way to escape the life he leads - golf - Train realizes that there is much more for him out in the world. Only, he can't reach the greatness awaiting him because of racial issues.<br />Train is the kind of novel Elmore Leonard would have written in the early part of his career, only with better characters and better writing. I enjoyed reading every single word printed in this novel, and can't wait to give it another shot.'t reach the greatness awaiting him because of racial issues. <br />Train is the kind of novel Elmore Leonard would have written in the early part of his career, only with better characters and better writing.

Although he writes in the horror genre, his writing is done with so much emotion and skill that you can easily lose yourself in the narrative. The Ferryman and Straight on Til Morning are two of the best horror novels published in the past decade.<br />That said, it comes with great disappointemnt to say that The Boys Are Back in Town is a step back for Golden. Although the very things that have made his previous books such successes (great characters, a very imaginative plot, beautiful writing) are present, the book nonetheless feels like something Golden would have written in the early parts of his career.<br />Will is getting ready to go to his high school reunion. Once there, he rekindles his friendship with all of his high school friends. But just as things start to fall into place, Will's memories of the past start to change. Mike, one of Will's friend, now seems to be dead while Will remembers e-mailing him just a few days before the reunion. More of his memories disappear, replaced by darker, more violent ones. <br />Why? Well, everything is related to the past. Seems like Will and his best friend Brian were deep into magic as teens. Now someone seems to be putting a spell on Will, one that changes his memories to make his present life a living hell. Will feels he has no choice but to cast a spell on himself to bring him back in time - to his senior year of high school - in order to stop whoever is murdering or torturing his friends. <br />The plot does sound like some bad 80s b-movie. And at times, the plot points feel just a bit too ludicrous and over-the-top to be truly enjoyable. And that's too bad, because Golden was able to create some very emotional moments in this book. Who wouldn't like to go back in time to change the way things were? Who wouldn't want to go back in time to meet his younger self and try to stop him from making the mistakes you've done? If Golden had played with this aspect more, the book would have been much stronger.<br />And the narrative isn't helped by the Carrie rip-off ending that never suits the book. That said, there is still a lot to love about this book. The nostalgic plot will often leave you feeling quite sad, while the characters feel so real and are so well written that it feels as though they were your own friends back in high school. Golden was always able to write vivid and realistic characters, and this one is no exception. <br />If this book did one thing for me, it made me wonder what Golden could do with a straight-on, non-genre narrative. The Boys are Back in Town is a novel full of emotions and plot twists that never ad up to what they should. And although this one is still better than half the horror books out there, I still couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed in the end.	2004-02-07

Not only is it scary and gruesome, it is also skillfully written and emotionally striking. This is the very stuff horror is made of. Brian Keene might very well be our answer to all those long years of bad horror.<br />Jim is trapped in his bomb shelter, the whole world around him dying. Even his pregnant wife has died to rise again to become part of the undead. When Jim receives a call on his cell from his son in New Jersey, he knows he has no choice but to get to him before the undead claim his life.<br />During his travels, he encounters an old preacher, an old survivor and his son and a military group that seems to be causing more harm than good. Many more characters are mixed to the lot, counting a prostitute with a cocaine addiction and a man who might just be the reason the dead have come to invade the earth. All of them are working for the same goal; survival.<br />Brutal, terrifying and honest, The Rising is that rare horror book that completely delivers the goods. You never really know where Keene's twisted imagination will lead you next, and it is this very unpredictability that makes The Rising stand high and tall above all others. The book offers many moment that will stay with you for a long time; a scene concerning a pregnant woman, and another one about a mute boy I will not soon forget. <br />The book is peopled with dozens of characters and yet, you never confuse any of them. Keene has found a very distinct voice for each of his characters. All of them feel very real. And the fact that Keene never falters, not even in the book's final moments, only enhances this truly terrifying experience.<br />Take note of Brian Keene's name. The Rising announces a bright new voice in horror fiction. He reminds us what real horror is all about.	2004-01-29

You would think that a talented writer like Robert Harris (Fatherland, Enigma) would know better than to fall into this trap. Alas, he does not. Although well researched and historically acurate, the book has too much information and not enough plot or characterisation to make the reader care about anything that is going on.<br />And that's too bad, because Pompeii had the potential of becoming a great historical epic. When the Roman aqueduc fails, it's up to Attilus to find the source of the problem and fix it before the greater part of Italian coast goes thirsty. He follows the problem back to Pompeii, an Italian city that is often plagued with earthquakes and where strange rumblings can often be heard. As he begins the repairs on the water system, he soon uncovers the truth of it all; that mount Vesuvius, the mountain overlooking the town, is actually very, very much alive. <br />Told during the last three days of Pompeii, the novel is a fast read full of events and characters that always leaves you craving for more. The characters are paper thin and the plot so derisive that you never care about any of the subplots Harris throws your way. As a matter of fact, now that I'm sitting here, trying to remember who the supporting characters were, they all seem to meddle into one big mess in my head.<br />But Harris should get credit in the research department, because the book is so well detailed that it often feels like a history lesson. Not only is he giving us a lesson on ancient Italian life, there is also a very good lesson on geology and volcanoes. Harris brings you right into the explosion and, with descriptive and very colorful writing, makes you see what this erruption must have been like for the people of Pompeii. <br />Maybe I was expecting too much from this one. In thend end, Pompeii is a good pulp novel, though not much morethan that. With more attention to characters and plot and maybe a bit less attention to details, the book would have been bound for greatness. As it stands, it is an entertaining read that probably won't stand the test of time.	2004-01-26

It's fun, thrilling and very, very entertaining. This book marks the debut of a bright new voice in horror fiction, one you will without a doubt hear from again in the near future.<br />Jason is a haunted by a horrible recurring nightmare. Then, he sees a message someone has left for him on the bathroom mirror: &quot;Remember&quot;. And as if that wasn't enough, strange things began happening all around him and someone is stalking him. Who is doing these things, and why?<br />With his friends Shorty and Brains, Jason will have to try and piece the puzzle back together in order to get the answers he seeks, all the while trying ot deal with his parents' failing marriage and relationship. <br />This is the bare-bone version of the book. I've tried to keep the description simple and brief because giving too much of the plot would be ruining and very surprising and truly enjoyable read. Let's just say that the book also includes a paranormal man, an otherworldly dimension and a lot of mayhem.<br />This is truly a horror novel. Massey throws plot twist after plot twist our way, all the while maintaining a near perfect pacing and tone. Some iffy dialog aside, and a there is very little to dislike about Thunderland. The ending is solid, the characters dinstinct and realistic and most of the scares are nail-biting good. <br />This is the kind of book I love. It centers around kids faced with a greater-than-life situation, it has a great villain and enough imagination to fill three or four more books. Give this one a try. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. And mark Brandon Massey's name somewhere in full view, because he'll surely become a major voice in horror fiction.	2004-01-21

The Kill Clause revolves around a premise so ridiculous and badly thought-out that you can never truly enjoy the narrative, or any single part of the book for that matter. And that's a shame, because Greg Hurwitz really has a great way with words. His writing is premise and very enticing; he's got a way with words that always makes you feel like reading on. It's too bad his talents were completely waisted on this book.<br />When Tim Rackley's young daughter is raped and murdered, the man thinks his life is over. At the trial, the murderer is released on a technicality. And then, he quits his job after being accused of having commited an offence while apprehending a murder suspect. That's when he is contatcted by The Commission, an organization composed of five men and one women who have all been mistreated by the judicial system at one point or another in theirl lives. <br />They have decided to take justice in their own hands. They will seek men who found a way to escape the system and kill them themselves. And they want Tim to be their prime hitman.<br />This is the kind of stuff you only read in books (or see in films). You cannot believe a single moment of this book. The fact alone that Tim accepts the Commission's proposition is ridiculous enough; in the beginning, when given the chance to excute his daughter's killer, he refuses because he knows better. It's hard to think that a man who is able to do such a thing would then turn around and become the very kind of monster he's been fighting all his life. As a matter of fact, all the characters are so badly sketched out that they all blend into one big incoherent mess. These characters have no real conviction, no real purpose. <br />As the plot progresses, Hurwitz throws ridiculous subplot after ridiculous subplot our way, to the point where I just couldn't wait to finish this book. The high morality lesson the author obviously wants to transmit with this book is so badly transposed that it falls on you like a five ton anvil. And the fact that you can see the little &quot;surprise&quot; near the end coming from a mile away doesn't help things.<br />That said, I'm sure the book will be turned into a Hollywood film. This is the kind of preposterous thing Hollywood craves; the kind of really bad b-movie you see coming out year after year and tanking miserably. I'm sure - I hope - Hurwitz is capable of much better. A true disappointment.	2004-01-16

This futuristic tale is all about the power of mankind over its own fate and the way in which the human race is a self-destructive one. Sagan takes us into a bleak and uncertain future that has more questions than it has answers, that has more darkness than it has light. <br />Welcome to Idlewild, the school of the future, where young men and women are shaped to become the very best they can be. The book opens with Halloween, a young man suffering from amnesia. He awakens in a strange, video game-like world where everything seems to be just a little bit off. He believes he has murdered Lazarus, a friend of his, though he doesn't know how or why. <br />As Halloween stumbles through this world, trying to uncover his personality in order to deal with the strangeness that surrounds him, he slowly unearths a plot that will change not only his existence but also the life of everyone concerned with Idlewild.<br />Saying any more about Idlewild would be ruining and perfectly entertaining and often thought-provoking read. Like his father, the great Carl Sagan, Nick Sagan seems to understand technology and uses it with great ease. Through his book, he poses many questions about humanity and our place in the world, questions that will stay with you for quite some time. This isn't lite reading. It's the kind of book that will make you think and debate with yourself.<br />Unfortunately, the book does falter in its last third, where the story seams to stall for a while until it offers us a somewhat disappointing finale. But the book is worth reading for its first half alone, which gave me something completely different and new. Sagan's writing feels cold and removed, true, but that's only because Halloween distant and removed. And the story contains enough twists and turns to please any type of reader. <br />Idlewild isn't a masterpiece, but it does presents its readerswith a bight new voice in speculative fiction. Sagan's vision of the future is both terrifying and enticing, intriguing and completely disturbing. A very good read.	2004-01-10
US	49059365	R2DBEJX57XEL0I	0525947140	229482873	A Visible Darkness (Max Freeman Novels)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	A Strong Follow-Up	Jonathon King's novice effort, A Visible Darkness, is another sharp, effective and, unfortunately, short police thriller that should thrill any fans of the genre. King brings back his retired cop, Max Freeman, for another dose of darkness and mayhem. And, although this one is very entertaining, it left me wanting more in the end. Like in the case of King's previous novel, the book is so short and straight to the point that you never really get the chance to fully enjoy it all because you keep on craving for more.<br />This time, Freeman faces a killer who pries on elderly women, killing them in a way to make their death look natural. As Freeman investigates, he uncovers a plot concerning an insurance company and an insurance investigator who might have one secret too many hidden in his closet. Add to this a very original and disturbing character, a feeble-minded street man, and you should have the formula for one heck of a book. Freeman once again teams up with his good friend and lawyer Billy, and the female cop, Richards, he began seeing after the events of King's first novel. <br />The plot of A Visible Darkness might be just a bit too simple for its own good. There were not enough subplots to let us really get  to know the characters. This is a pretty basic plot that takes you from point A to point B without any added troubles. It's a very, very rare case of 'more is better'. <br />And yet, I really enjoyed A Visible Darkness. Freeman is a great character, always broody, often cynical. And Richards will hopefully pop up in King's next novel; she is a very mysterious character I can't wait to get to know better. <br />I get the feeling that Jonathon King is just on the verge of writing one heck of a thriller. If he can let himself explore his characters a bit more and throw more a few more problems their way, all the while capturing the very same levels of suspense and thrills this one presented, his next novel could very well end up being a great one.	2004-01-07

But on closer examination, The Clearing isn't much more than surface gloss. The book never really achieves what it strives to get at, and is nothing like the books it has been compared too (like the more richer, better layered and better peopled Cold Mountain and All The Pretty Horses).<br />Maybe that's because the book is much longer than is should be. I had to drudge my way through the first two hundred pages. And just as I was about to give up, I finally found myself entertained by a plot twist that transformed the entire narrative and somewhat redeemed the novel.<br />Randolph is sent to a Louisiana clearing by his father not only to manage the wood mill, but also to look after his brother Byron who came back from the war a changed man. Randolph tries to change things the moment he arrives at the mill, until he realizes that he can't change the deep-rooted way of life the countryside folks have adopted.<br />Things change for him when his wife comes to Nimbus to help him manage things. When Randolph does the grave mistake of killing a man with ties to the Italian mob, things start going awry for him, his family and the mill workers. <br />This isn't a book about plot, it is a book of happenings, giving the whole thing an episodic feel that is strangely out of place in narrative ficiton. Each chapter seems to introduce a new plot point which is resolved by the end of this very chapter. Although this changes somewhat in the last third of the book, there doesn't seem to be an underlying current that links the different plot points.<br />But the thing that really disappointed me was the way in which the author decided to give us too little about the characters. Because Gautreaux never really tells us what these men (and women) are all about, they end up feeling one and the same. There are no real character traits that differentiate one man from the next, rendering every single character into paper-thin men. <br />The Clearing received a lot of hype when it was first released, and it's unfortunate to realize that it was just that. Hype. I really had to force myself to finish this one, which is a rare thing for me. This one isn't all that it's cracked up to be.	2004-01-03

His stories are usually brilliantly written and full of originality. His dark fiction - Mieville is part of the New Fabulists movement - is often horrific, often fantastical, and always epic in size.<br />The Tain is a short novellette that, although it does feel like vintange Mieville at times, lacks the power and strength of his longer works. London has been ravaged by vampire creatures that have walked straight out of mirrors. That's right, our reflections are really trapped entities that are tired of mimicking our every action. And so, when they find a way to escape their glass prisons, they seek revenge on humans. <br />Sholl, a regular man (only a few of them are remaining, most men are actually enlisted in the army) is intrigued by these vampire creatures. He finds a way to break into their world to try and restore the peace that these creatures have stolen from mankind.<br />Overwrought and long-winded, The Tain is predictable and not very original. It feels like just another revisionist tale (and, maybe that's just what it is). This feels more like the outline for a longer, better novel. Or maybe it's a short story trapped in too many words and unecessary subplots.<br />I am a big fan of Mieville's work. But The Tain disappointed me greatly. It pains me to see Mieville fall into the trap so many novice authors tumbled into. Hopefully, his next work will be more original and as powerful as ever.	2003-12-27

His films are lyrical and very emotional. They are beautiful, always thoughtful and very touching. That's why I counted my lucky stars when I learned that Minghella would next adapt one of the best and most beautiful books I've ever read, Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain.<br />Could Mountain: The Journey from Book to Film takes you on the road that everyone involved with this film walked down. First, we meet Minghella and Frazier, as they both discuss the writing of the book and of the script. Then, we meet the producers, the set desingers, the cinematographer, the costume desingers, the actors, the editor... Everyone who played a major role in the making of this film is presented in this book.<br />I haven't yet see the film and cannot say if the greatness of the book translated well when it was taken to the silver screen. But judging from the interviews and the pictures in this film, I have to say that I don't think I'll be disappointed. The pictures in this book are beautiful and very attractive; you can already tell that this will be one heck of a film to look at (the pictures alone are the kind of visual candy you can't pry yourself away from). And then, the book also reprinted parts of Minghella's screenplay. And like we saw in his other films, The English Patient and The Talented Mr Ripley, Minghella really has a knack for writing engaging and touching dialogue. <br />Reading this book only made me want to see the film even more. It's rare that you are allowed to partake in this kind of journey, following a film's progress from point A to point Z. But this book brings you right into the heart of the film's production, discussing all the problems the crew faced, and telling us little annecdotes about the making of this film. Cold Mountain might not end up being the greatest film ever made (although I do wish it is), but I can tell, judging by this book, that it will be a great and very important film.	2003-12-26
US	49059365	R27AVAN8PPABJM	1587670712	438942422	The Necromancer	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Harrow Revisited	I am in awe of Douglas Clegg. Each new story he produces seems to top the last in every possible way. Cemetery Dance now brings us this short novella, The Necromancer, which continues Clegg's Harrow mythology (which also includes the novels Nightmare House, The Infinite and Mischief). This new story gives us the back story on the early years of Justin Gravesend's life, the man who later build the Harrow House.<br />Clegg is a writer without fear. He can write amazing quiet horror (like The Hour Before Dark, one of the best horror novels published in the last decade), but he can also write stories that are more visceral and gruesome (such as in the stories White Chapel and The Rendering Man) . The Necromancer stands somewhere in the middle.<br />When Gravesend leaves his hometown and moves in with his uncle in the 1920s, he decides to make a new life for himself. He enters college (even though he is a poor country boy) and starts befriending the richer, upper class. During a travel to the big city of London, Justin is greeted with a life he didn't know existed. It is here that he will meet his master, his Necromancer, the man that will open his eyes to the dark world that has been his gift since birth.<br />Short, disturbing and very entertaining, The Necromancer is vintage Clegg. It is the kind of book you simply cannot put down, the kind of story that leaves you craving for more. After finishing The Necromancer, I just felt like running to my bookcase to find all the Harrow book and read them all over again. Clegg is really a master of the game; no one writes horror like he does.	2003-12-24

Not only is his prose beautiful and very imaginative, his plotting is also tight and intricate. His books are usually about characters placed in dawry situations, and not about situations affecting characters. This is psychological horror at its very best. <br />Bailey is no stranger to the ghost story. He began his career with a non-fiction examination of the haunted house in literature, so it is only fitting that his latest effort touches the very same thing he's been examining for so long. In House of Bones, Bailey throws five strangers into an eery setting that might or might not be haunted. Dreamland was once part of an apartment complex. It is now the only remaining tower, standing alone, forgotten and decrepit. Dreamland has a very strange and violent history, one that was never fully put to rest, one that should never be brought to the surface. <br />When our five strangers enter the building to try and investigate the strange happenings, they will soon realize that the house itself seems to be very much alive. Paranoia, claustrophobia and fear will start coursing in their veins as the house will slowly close up on them. Their arrival awakens the house and brings back its thirst.  <br />Nothing is as it seems to be. One by one, the five of them will be faced with the horrors and monsters of their past. They will soon discover that the past is always waiting to come back to them. All of them have horrible secrets to hide, and all of them have horrible dreams about the things they've done wrong. When the house awakens, so will their past, and their fear will become a very, very real thing. Everything spirals, leading us to the great climax that will make you keep on turning the pages until the early hours of the morning. <br />In House of Bones, Bailey fully displays his talents. With only two books and one collection under his belt, he has already become one of the brightest voices in genre fiction.The fact that he never sacrifices character development for plot is a thing most new authors take years to learn. The fact that he carefully construct his stories, where each word has a purpose, only makes this book greater. This is quiet horror at its very best.	2003-12-23

The last few years has a offered a softer version of Lansdale who, although still writing mysteries, has decided to deal more with the pains and fears of growing up. A Fine Dark Line is another addition to this lot and, although it is genuine Lansdale, the whole still left me a bit disappointed. This one felt more like the outline for a greater novel than anything else.<br />Stanley is a thirteen year old boy who, during the summer of 1958, moves with his family to a new town. His father has bought the town's drive-in as a family business and that's where Stan will see himself live with his parents and sister. Soon enough, he uncovers a box full of old letters, which will lead him to discover a mystery that has just been waiting to be unearthed.<br />The mystery deals with a couple of young girls who were killed nearly thirty years ago. Their deaths are still unresolved and Stanley, with the help of his sister and the old projectionist, decides to figure things out by himself.<br />Since the book is set in the 50s it will, of course, deal with sexuality, with the black revolution and with movies of the era. Lansdale tries to deal with too much in too little time. There are great echoes of To Kill a Mockingbird in this one (even a Boo Radley-like character appears in A Fine Dark Line), which just shows the kind of thing Lansdale was striving to achieve. The book is barely 300 pages long and yet, it has more to deal with than most books twice its size. It really saddens me to say that this one feels more like an outline Lansdale didn't feel he had to courage to see through.<br />I still enjoyed reading A Fine Dark Line. The book has great characters and some very chilling situation. But the whole thing left me thirsting for more. This is the rare case where the story could have used a little more flesh on its skeleton. As it stands, A Fine Dark Line is an average book by an author capable of much better (like his great book The Bottoms, one of the best mystery to ever see print).	2003-12-15

The book is brutal, realistic and very enthralling to read. Before you know it, you'll find yourself completely hooked to this amazing story of revenge and greed. Author Tom Franklin has created a small masterpiece that should not go unoticed.<br />When a local man living with the poor farmers on the outskirts of Coffeeville is murdered, the common folks gather to form a group they will call Hell-at-the-Breech, a group that will have as a mission to take revenge on the greedy and rich townfolks. These cotton pickers and labourers have very little left to hang on to. As the days passes by, more and more of them are loosing whatever little they do have left to the banks and loaners, many of them even facing eviction. <br />In the middle of this story are Mack, a poor sixteen year old boy who will have a great role in the upheaval, and Billy Waite, the town's old Sheriff who doesn't know how to handle this sour situation. As the poor prepare to get revenge on the rich, Mack will serve as the eyes and soul of this novel, the boy who sees all but who doesn't say much. Waite, on the other hand, is trying to calm the townsfolk, especially after the gang hits the town and kills a very reputable man.<br />Hell breaks loose and all best are off as both sides eventually go to battle in order to get revenge and in order to preserve what they think is the right set of laws. This story could have easily gone out of hand, but Tom Franklin weaves a flawless narrative that is very balanced and very intriguing. His characters are never perfect; these are flawed men with dreams and fears who are all awaiting to get something better out of life. His characters are very realistic, a thing that is greatly helped by Franklin's incredible talent at writing dialogue. <br />A great book with great characters and with a great plot is a winner in my book. Read this one and I'm sure you won't be sorry. This is one book that is bound for greatness.	2003-12-10
US	49059365	RRVGFQR8MN6VW	1879505673	608198299	John Carpenter: The Prince of Darkness	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Great Primer	John Carpenter: Prince of Darkness is a great primer for all of Carpenter's fans. You will not learn much about the man's life, or the man himself for that matter. Even though this is an interview book, Carpenter reveals suprisingly little about himself. Some of his ideas and convictions are touched upon, but briefly.<br />This book is really like a short making-of for each of Carpenter's films, starting with his early childhood efforts to his latest Hollywood venture, Ghosts of Mars. In here, you will learn all about the troubles he had getting into the business and the way in which he persevered, until he made the one film that made him famous.<br />That film, Halloween, is discusses in great lengths in this book. And why not? This is probably Carpenter's most famous (and arguably best) film. But the fun doesn't stop there. You'll get great interviews about the Escape films, about The Thing, about Big Trouble in Little China, about Vampires, about They Live, Prince of Darkness, Christine, The Fog... Each and every film Carpenter has touched is discussed here.<br />I have to admit that I had a great deal of fun reading the chapter on my favourite film of his, In The Mouth of Madness. I loved reading all the little anecdotes and about all the problems he faced while doing these films. As a matter of fact, Carpenter opens up and tells all about the making of these films and keeps very little secret (except in the case of Ghost of Mars, where he turns suddenly very cold and evasive).  <br />My only problem with this book is that it is too short. You never feel like you're getting the whole story. These short chapters (most of them barely 10 pages long, half of these pages comprised of pictures) never really get into the films themselves. The interviews sometime feel a bit shallow. Maybe I feel this way because I'm such a big fan of Carpenter's and I'd love reading more about his thoughts and ideas. I guess that proves I'm a true fan. And after reading this book, I'm sure you will become one as well.	2003-12-07

I've read some people call this one the best American thriller of the last decade. Although I'm not quite sure if it is the best, it sure has its place somewhere at the top. <br />Kate loses her family home (the one her father built) when she is accused of tax evasion. Only, the tax office has made a mistake and evicts her for no reason. Her house is then sold on the auction market for less than half its value to a foreign family. When the mistake is made known to this new family, the father, a proud ex-colonel who is now hiding in America, refuses to sell the house back even though it rightfully belongs to Kate.<br />Colonel Behrani is a proud man who is all about appearances. He prefers looking good to others and lives beyond his means. He is proud of this bargain he's had on the house and now plans to sell it for triple the price he paid for the small bungalow. When Kate enters their lives, he automatically shuts down and ignores the poor woman's pleas.<br />Kathy meets a young officer and starts seeing him. Leslie is quickly drawn into Kate's world and finds himself right in the middle of a brewing emotional storm. This character, who appears to be a quiet, reserved and simple man on the surface is a time bomb waiting to explode.<br />Needles to say that the payoff of these events will be left engraved in your mind for quite some time. I have to tip my hat to Andre Dubus for having created characters you both hate and like. In the beginning, you find yourself rooting for Kate, but as the story progresses and as the characters sink deeper into their pile of problems, this emotional attachment changes and you end up sympathizing with the Colonel and his family.<br />This is a literary thriller that would have made Hitchcock proud. Told mostly in the first person, the book tangles very touching and emotional subjects that will affect the characters and readers both. These characters are so pathetic you can't help but feel sorry for them, but they are also very egocentric, to the point where you start hating them for what they do. These are flawed characters that feel so real they almost bleed off the page.<br />I couldn't put this one down. Once the reader lets go and enters the narrative, he will partake in a trip he won't soon forget, one full of darkness, full of blood, full of betrayal, and full of tears and rage.	2003-12-01

And the good news is, the book is great. Amazing even. The sad news is, this book only means that the end of the series is coming soon. Too soon.<br />In Wolves of the Calla, we find Roland, Jake, Susan and Eddie continuing their trek following the events at the end of Wizard and Glass. Their journey brings them to the town of Calla. The citizens of the Calla are looking for help; every twenty years or so, wolf-like creatures come into the town and steal many of the children. When they are returned, the children come back brain dead and completely empty. Now that they've learn the wolves will soon be coming, they ask Roland and his ka-tet for help and protection. <br />It is in Calla that they encounter Father Callahan, a character that was first featured in King's Salem's Lot. The Father joins them in their misison and gives them a very useful but dangerous tool that will help them travel through the different worlds. This tool comes in handy when they realize they will have to go back to New York circa 1976 to protect the rose that stands on that empty lot, a rose that could in fact be the tower itself.<br />Full of imagination and great wit, Wolves of the Calla shows that King hasn't lost his touch. The book is rich in ideas, and borrows freely from pop culture; Harry Potter, Star Wars, DC Comics, The Wizard of Oz and Stephen King himself are all featured prominently in the novel. All of it only makes this book greater than it already is. The pacing is quick, the writing tight, and the story very suspenseful. There is never a dull moment in Wolves (the parts where Father Callahan recalls his story might very well be some of King's finest writing). <br />This installment in the Dark Tower series will not disappoint. It can easily be read as a sole effort, but will be better understood as a part of this amazing ongoing series. I can't wait to read the next installment, but dread the day when I will turn the last page of the last Dark Tower book. That might very well be the saddest moment of my life.	2003-11-26

Last year saw the publication of his first novel, the greatly atmospheric and horrific Fallen. Now, Golden Gryphon Press has published Bailey's first collection, which reunites most of the work he has published in the Fiction &amp; Science Fiction magazine. <br />And what a collection it is! You probably won't read a better amalgation of sci-fi/horror stories this year (or in the next couple of years for that matter). The collection opens with the title story, a very touching and imaginative tale about a boy who's dead father is resurrected into a robot-like man. I dare anyone to read this story and not feel completely emotionally torn in the end.<br />Death and Sufferage is another great zombie story (a theme that Bailey often touches upon) that will remain in your mind for quite some time. Touched and Quinn's Way are stories about childhood, the kind of coming-of-age tales only an expert writer is able to write. These are stories that are effective in all the right places, pushing all the right buttons. And The Census Taker is a story that feels like vintage Stephen King but that is even more emotionally gripping. <br />It's impossible to pick a favourite out of this collection. Bailey's writing is reminiscent of the early Ray Bradbury, only with more feeling, more nuance. Bradbury's writing could often feel cold; Bailey's is very warm, rich and demanding. The author has a way with words that is worthy of poetry. Beautiful prose graces every story, a thing that isn't easy to find in genre fiction. If there is such a thing as literary sci-fi/horror, I guess this is it! <br />I urge anyone who hasn't tried Dale Bailey to do so, and fast. That is one name that will, soon enough, become a major player in genre fiction. The fact that his stories are accessible to all and not just a small core audience only broadens his horizon. A major and important collection by a man who hasn't finished impressing us.	2003-11-16

In the first pages of Blood Canticle, Anne Rice's beloved Vampire Lestat tells us not to fret, that this story will pick up where Blackwood Farm left off and that the story will have a beginning, a middle and an end (in other words, a plot). Well, Rice has just made a liar out of Lestat, because there is very little plot to be found in Blood Canticle. As a matter of fact, there is very little to appreciate in this self-loathing, overrought novel.<br />The novel more or less does pick up the loose ends of Blackwood Farm. This time, it is the young, sickly Mona who is made into one of the undead, upon Quinn's demand. But Mona proves to be Lestat's female counterpart; mean, always complaining, unrespectful and with very little love left in her. The one thing she does wants most, however, is to find the daughter who was stolen from her so many years ago.<br />Her daughter was one of the Taltos, a strange kind of creature that grows tall in just a few days and who nearly kills the mother that gives birth to them. She asks Lestat to help her find this people so that she can be with her daughter once again. <br />And that's it. Lestat will moan about a ghost that will not leave him alone and Quinn, the great, carismatic protagonist of Blackwood Farm, is nearly forogtten and completely underused. And the melding of Rice's vampire and witches series doesn't go as smoothly this time around. <br />Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles had taken a hard blow in the last few years, only to be given life again with Blackwood Farm. But now, it almost seems as though Blackwood Farm was a fluke, because Blood Canticle has very, very little to offer fans of the series. Even Letat has changed, and for the worst. Maybe it's time for Anne Rice to put the Chronicles to rest for a while to concentrate on something new and fresh.	2003-11-06
US	49059365	R1A2CXSKQJZQUB	0446531391	465248288	The Breathtaker	Books	3	5	7	N	N	A Fun Read	Alice Blanchard's Darkness Peering was a masterful work of suspense that left a deep impression on me. Now, she's finally back with her sophomore effort, The Breathtaker. Although the book never achieves the level of suspense her first novel did, and although the characters are not as intriguing and interesting as the ones in Darkness Peering, the novel itself is still a very fun and entertaining read.<br />Charlie is the Sheriff of a small Kansas town, where three bodies are discovered after a tornado ravages the town. Their deaths seems to be a result of the tornado at first, but on closer examination, Charlie realizes that the whole family was murdered. A little bit more digging into the past reveals that many have been murdered during tornados in the past, the killer leaving only one sign behind; a milk tooth which he usually places in the victim's mouth. <br />Charlie has to take care of his investigation, but he also has to take care of his young daughter who is still very much inflicted by sadness after her mother's death. The investigation quickly mixes with Charlie's personal life as everyone around him becomes a suspect.<br />Is the murderer his father, the very man who used to abuse him as a child? Is it the town rebel, Boone, who's also in love with Charlie's daughter? Or is it one of the town officers who mysteriously disappears? The list of suspects is a mile long. <br />And that might be the book's biggest problem; it's much too busy and tries too hard to offer too many suspects to the reader. On the other end, the very emotional scenes between Charlie and his father and daughter are very powerful and moving. They almost bleed off the page with realism. Furthermore, there are some great moments of suspense bordering terror in this book that will send shivers crawling down your spine. <br />The Breathtaker is just different enough to be fully entertaining for the reader, even if the book lacks the spark and life we found in Darkness Peering. Then again, it probably wasn't easy following that nearly perfect mystery novel. In the end, The Breathtaker will thrill you while it lasts, if only that.	2003-10-29

The book is pretty simple in itself and yet, it hits you as hard as a hammer on a nail. It's sweet and dark, affecting and touching, invigorating and a real page-turner. <br />Known for his oversized novels (his Rose trilogy and Floating Dragon, as well as The Talisman and Black House with Stephen King), Straub comes back in full force with this very small effort that is full of soul and emotion. When Mark finds his mother's dead body in their bathtub - an obvious suicide - he knows that his life will never be the same again. He also knows that the old delapidated house behind their own had something to do with his mother's death. But what? When he begins investigating the house, he uncovers deep-buried secrets that are just waiting to resurface.<br />Told through flashbacks, diary entries and e-mail conversations, the book meanders throught time in amazing ways. Not many authors  can weave such an intricate plot together. The sections that are set in the present are told from Mark's uncle's point of view, an author of mystery novels who's never been close to his brother. But now that his nephew has disappeared, he has to tried and patch things up with his brother in order to be able to face the harsh reality of the situation.<br />Is it a ghost story? Not really. A murder mystery? Not really. A romance? Not really. The book is more like a mix of all these things and more. You never really know where the book is headed or where it will take you. And saying that the book ends on just the right note would be an understatement. <br />I've just finished the book and I'm tempted to start it again. Straub has a way with words that will take your breathe away. This is the kind of horror novel that will stand the test of time. I'm sure that, ten years from now, lost boy lost girl will be remembered as one of Straub's best, if not his best.	2003-10-23

He usually tells complicated, intricate stories full of strange and original characters. His lead character, Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker, is your perfect private investigator; dark, broody, with a closet full of skeletons and secrets. But this time, with The White Road, Connolly has tried to go all the way, to differing results. This time around, the story might be just a little too complicated and convulted for its own good.<br />This time around, Parker leaves Maine to go help a lawyer friend in need. Elliott is representing Atys, a young black man accused of having killed his white lover, who just happens to be the daughter of the richest and most powerful man in the state. Soon enough, Parker faces hitman after hitman, and strange character after strange character with the help of his long-time friend (and hitman) Louis. Meanwhile, Louis's lover, Angel, is trying to get revenge on the man who nearly caused his death in Connolly's previous book. Both stories quickly entangle with one another as secret after secret is slowly revealed.<br />I enjoyed the plot and pacing of The White Road. Connolly is a sparse writer who is great at creating emotionally tense narratives. But this time around, his story has too many characters for its own good. With his previous novels, Connolly had created vivid and eery supporting characters. There are too many of those in The White Road, and soon enough, they all blend in together. True, the menace is always there, but you never get to really care about the situations Parker finds himself in because a new character is introduced with each new chapter.  <br />Still, The White Road is vintage Connolly; a mystery with a twist of the paranormal. You never know what will happen in a Connolly novel, keeping you on the constant edge of your seat. <br />The White Road is not a bad bood. As a matter of fact, it is a very entertaining one. But compared to the other great, masterful thriller Connolly has written in the past, this one doesn't quite  reach the level of success of its predecessors.	2003-10-18

It's that rare touching, crowd-pleasing effort that leaves you breathless and craving for more. It is a rich, complex, yet short, story that will amaze you with its power and audacity.<br />Michele is a nine year old Italian boy who, like every other boy on the block, likes playing sports and playing dare with his friends and little sister. One day, he enters a delapidated house on a dare. And in there, he finds a covered-up hole. At its bottom is a small boy, dirty and sickly, scrawny and afraid.<br />Michele has just stumbled upon a plot that involves almost every single male in town. Saying any more would ruin a completely surprising story. Let me just say that Michele befriends the little boy, Fillipo, and will try and help him out as best he can.<br />Like Stephen King's The Body (which was made into the movie Stand By Me) or McCammon's Boy's Life, I'm Not Scared is a novel that belongs to one of the most beloved and yet most complicated genre there is; the coming of age tale. Told through the eyes of a child, the novel has that dream-like quality that almost seems magical on the page. You will live what Michele lives, and you will experience his loss of innoncence and move into manhood. The whole novel has a sad, nostalgic quality that drenches every page with emotions. <br />I'm Not Scared is short (barely 200 pages long) and yet, it will probably be better than most book you've read in the last year. It is that rare rich book that will probably become a classic down the line. A great little gem that deserves to be discovered.	2003-10-08

In the span of a year, he's been released from prison, beaten to a bloody pulp dozens of times, waltzed with death on more than one occasion, has outsmarted different hitmen and killers, has been able to unite with the mob, and now, in his new outing, he survives a gunshot wound to the head. But this might very well be Kurtz's most challenging outing yet. Because in Hard As Nails, Kurtz is beaten up so many times that you're left wondering how this guy can possibly still be standing.<br />The book opens with the event that leaves Kurtz in a coma for a few days. After surviving that gunshot wound to the head, and after having saved his parole officer from death, Kurtz is determined to find the man who nearly killed him. To do so, he'll need to unite with the two leading mob families and his regular troupe (like his secretary Arlene and a hitman called The Dane) of hired hands.<br />Kurtz stumbles on a story that is worthy of Hollywood, one that involves a family of ex-CIA operatives, a dead boy who might not be dead and, to top it all off, a crazy old man in a wheelchair and his Asian help. Let me assure you that Kurtz has more than enough to keep himself busy.<br />Hard As Nails is the third Joe Kurtz novel Dan Simmons has written. And this might very well be the weakest. It seems that Kurtz has lost his bite and sarcastic edge. His witty comments are sparse and his erratic personality is almost nonexistant this time around. Often, Kurtz takes a backseat to let other characters come to the forefront. <br />And yet, in the end, Hard as Nails still works. Simmons is a very talented author who knows how to write a plot that will keep readers entertained. Written in short chapters, Hard as Nails is a fast read that offers much fun. You won't believe any of it (in this one, Kurtz is presented as a superman-like figure who has more lives than a cat) but you'll still have fun turning the page just to see what Kurtz will do next.	2003-10-05

After running away from home at a very young age, she now lives in a tent on a campground, picking mushrooms for a living. She has few friends, passing the time the only way she knows how; by taking drugs to relieve herself from the everyday pain she constantly feels.<br />One day, during her daily trek into the woods, she sees something floating above the trees. She falls to her knees and goes into a trance-like phase. When she awakens from it, she tells the people around her that she has just seen the Virgin Mary. When this event reoccurs the next day, and the one after that, Ann grows a small gathering of followers that seems to grow by the day.<br />Soon enough, the small town of North Fork quickly fills up with the visionary's followers. But as thousands gather around the young girl, others cannot let themselves believe in her vision. Primary among these are the town's priest, who, although infatuated with the girl, cannot let himself believe she is seeing the Virgin Mary. And then there is the town's troublemaker whose mind is so boggled and confused that he does not know what to believe anymore.<br />Are the visions real? Is the Virgin Mary really coming to the young girl with words or wisdom and warnings? Unfortunately, Guterson does the grave error of answering this question. But this flaw aside, Our Lady of the Forest is a great book that keeps  attacking one of today's most touchy subject; the place faith and religion holds in today's modern world.<br />As with his previous novels, the prose in this book is flawless. Guterson is a master storyteller who has an incredible way with words. He often leaves you breathless with his gracefully long descriptions of people, places and events. The dialog is sparse, and the emotional content raised to its limit. <br />Our Lady of the Forest is the rare kind of book that, while being highly philosophical and intellectiual, still remains entertaining for the reader, a thing that can only be attributed to Guterson's realistic and touching characters and his storytelling skills. You will love to hate these people, and hate to love them as well. Mixed emotions is just the thing Our Lady of the Forest wants you to feel. Another great effort by a skilled, masterful author.	2003-09-30
US	49059365	R1H9KYJHESQON9	0786015799	26280904	The Harvest	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Good horror fun	The Harvest is a good old-fashioned alien invasion horror story, but this time, with great characters and some very intense moment. There isn't a dull moment in this book that moves along at the speed of a freight train. Everything is quick, and the ending result is quite entertaining.<br />An alien life form lands on earth and begins to possess every single person in a North Carolinian town. The alien takes over the body and turns them into mush, using these host to infect the others in town. You have the requisite mean and clueless town mayor, the stupid town sheriff, the woman with paranormal powers and the old crazy man who might not be all that crazy after all.<br />Predictable? Yes. Fun? Heck yeah. Nicholson knows how to write fiction and great characters that are both colorful and completely realistic. He knows how to draw a story, bringing his readers right into the plot of the story with the characters.<br />The only major problem with the book is that it might be a bit too busy at times. There are many characters to follow, and many plot points to go along with. After a while, the whole scenario becomes just a bit too overwhelming.<br />The Harvest is a fun horror, old-fashioned horror novel that will work as a quick, entertaining read. Give the book a try, and you won't be sorry.	2003-09-26

He does so with the skill of a pro. Reading a Harper novel is like watching a great, intense movie. You can't help the nail-biting, the sweaty palms and the palpitating heart. <br />Red Angel picks up a year or so after the events of Harper's first novel, Bad Karma. This time, psychologist Trey, who works at Darden State Prison, is going back to work even though he is still haunted  by the events of his past. But that will be the least of his worries the moment he steps foot inside the prison.<br />There just happens to be a murderer on the loose, who abducts young children, murders them and then leaves their body disguised as angels. When the killer, who somehow seems connected to one of Darden's inmates, takes the son of Elise, another woman who works for the prison, Trey will be thrown into of yet another nightmare.<br />The book moves along with the speed of a bullet. The action is more intense as anything you will read this year. There isn't a dull moment in Red Angel, let alone a few pauses to let the reader breathe a little. Do not pick up this book if you do not want to finish it in one sitting. It is that good.<br />I had a blast reading Red Angel. This book is actually as good as what Thomas Harris has written. This is a great thrill ride you won't soon forget, guaranteed!	2003-09-17
US	49059365	R3A402A1F0MPIC	1931081808	403538968	The Five of Cups	Books	3	9	21	N	N	Even the Great Ones Fail	The Five of Cups is the previously unpublished first novel by author Caitlin Kiernan. It is a vampire story from an author who believes that the whole vampire genre should be put to rest for a while. Caitlin Kiernan is a very talented author whose imagination simply outbeats everyone else's in the genre. Unfortunately, she didn't put her talents to full use when writing this novel. Instead of reinventing the genre, or at least offering something fresh and new, she falls victims to the very same cliches she abdicates.<br />Gin is a troublesome vampire who has very little will to live. Made into a vampire against her will, she always needs to go against the rules and laws of the dark world she lives in. She kills remorselessly and answers to no one but herself. Even her creator, a two hundred year old vampire (who is also a very rich, very cold-blooded killer), has no control over her. Because of the many mistakes Gin has made, he now wants to stop her before she uncovers the vampire world to humans. But to stop her, he much first catch her, something that is easier said than done.<br />There are a few very powerful scenes in this book that you will not soon forget. At one point, Gin enters a church to confess her sins. Her visit ends in a bloodbath. The whole scene plays with a very powerful mix of sorrow and rage that seems to jump right off the page. But these moments aren't enough to save the otherwise tepid narrative.<br />There is very little to like in these characters. It's almost as if the author is trying to turn you off. Instead of telling us what these vampires are all about, she tells us nothing about them until the very end, when it's too late for us to care for any of them (the flashback sequences, however, are some of the most amazing moments in this book). We all know that reading a Cailtin Kiernan novel isn't usually a happy experience. Her stories are dark, emotional and very depressing. But this time, she crosses the fine line between being impactful and too depressing. <br />The Five of Cups feels too episodic and sligthly unfinished. It's almost as if the author gave up halfway through writing the book and finished it in a hurry. Caitlin Kiernan has written some great fiction, but this is far from presenting what she's really capable of. The Five of Cups isn't a bad book, it's just not a very good one.	2003-09-15

But when his books didn't sell well in the States, he took his publisher's advice and reinvented himself by changing his name and by chosing to write fiction in a whole different genre. But as they say, some things are better left untouched. There is very little enjoyment to be found in this story that's just too complicated and too full of incompatible ideas for its own good.<br />The novel follows two different stories. The first is of a man who's parents died in a car accident. A conspiracy is soon unveiled, one that puts doubt over their death and over the man's own past. Then, you have the sad, broody cop who's hunting a killer who also kidnapped the cop's daughter (how original!). <br />Eventually, these two stories meet. But the reader is left in the dark for so too long that he soon loses interest. The connections between the two plots aren't strong enough to be believable. The moment the two stories meet, the book collapses, falling into a mess of subplot after subplot that never leads anywhere. The author just seems to be digging his own grave. <br />And the fact that the author never really explains anything doesn't help matters. I hate a book where everything is given to you. The reader should be left to discover SOME things by himself. But not everything. Marshall is so vague when it comes to explaining the plot that the reader is left wondering if the author every really knew himself what was going on.<br />The Straw Men is a mess of idea that never seem to mesh well with one another. And that's a shame, because Marshall can write very complicated and fully fleshed out stories. He can write great characters that are intriguing. But none of that is to be found in Straw Men. Maybe Michael Marshall should leave the Dean Koontz territory to Dean Koontz and stick with what he knows best: Sci-fi.	2003-09-11

The main plot which, in any other hands, could have turned into your average thrill-a-minute police investigation is only the basis for character developement in Samaritan. Price isn't really concerened about plot. What he does care for are his characters and their interraction with one another.<br />Ray is a man who doesn't really know what he wants. He needs to be loved, needs to be told that he is needed or wanted and, because of this very flaw, Ray is a very unhappy man. He can't connnect with his daughter, can't keep a job, can't seem to find a way to feel truly happy even when everything seems to be going okay in his life. When he is found beaten to a bloody pulp in his apartment, people believe that Ray has stepped into some sort of sour deal he can't find a way out of. But as we're about to learn, Ray doesn't want to tell who hurt him. He doesn't even seem to care about it. <br />Enters Nerese, a cop who's on the brink of retirement and a woman who used to know Ray when they were growing up in a harsh and brutal part of New York. She's decided that she will figure out who hurt Ray before retirering, something that is easier said than done.<br />Told in flashbacks and through dialog, the book is the kind that grabs you by the gut by its shear intelligence and brilliance. It is a rare thing to find a book where every single character feels real, as if he or she is about to jump right out of the page. Price brings his characters to life in a way no other author can. And as if that wasn't enough, Price proves himself a master at writing dialog. The characters often go on long rants, recalling the past, or more precisely, recalling their own interpretation of the past. These moments are like listening to a master storyteller telling a story. You won't want to skip a single word. <br />Nostalgia drenches every page of this book, and so does pain and misery. Through each other, these characters learn to accept themselves in a way they've never been able to before. And although the book never reaches the high happy note each character is triving for, its quiet ending is simply perfect.<br />Samaritan is a slice-of-life that completely blew my mind away. I can't recall the last time a book got to me so much. This was my first time trying Price, and now that I'm hooked, I'm sure it won't be the last.	2003-09-01
US	49059365	RVJTXAGYWXKO4	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Good, Entertaining Fun	When you start a Michael Crichton novel, you go in knowing that you won't be getting something that's too literary. Crichton's writing is very simplistic and, yes, very cinematic, which is why his books tend to adapt to the screen so well. Timeline is no exception to the rule. While the book is never anything more than a mere escapist fare, it's a step above some of his other recent misfires (Airframe, The Lost World and Congo come to mind).<br />This time around, Crichton brings us back to the middle ages. Scientists have found a way to bend time to do a sort of time travel that brings people back in time by using parallel universes (as one character explains, it's kind of like faxing a person from one universe to the other - what you get on the other end is a copy of the message, not the original). When a professor and archeologist goes missing in the Middle Ages (during the 100 years war between France and England), it will be up to three graduate students to go back in time and get the professor before he is trapped in the past forever.<br />Sounds simplistic? That's because it is. Timeline is nothing more than one very long, very intricate and very entertaining action sequence. The characters are very typical of the Crichton novel; you have Chris, the young, shy guy who soon becomes the hero, Andre, the action hero-like historian and Kate, the underdeveloped and underused female protagonist. Heck, you even have a young computer wiz who comes in to save the day. But there's nothing wrong with familiarity when the book is so much fun.<br />You can always count on Crichton to do his research. This book is very detailed, although his description of medieval times can be questionable at times. Still, he gives a more accurate version of the period than most other novels of this kind do. I had a great time reading this book. Once you are able to get past the flimsy premise and avert your eyes from all the plot holes, you'll realize that this book isn't bad one bit.<br/>Timeline is the one book that comes close to equaling Crichton's Jurassic Park. It's a great beach read that will make a very good, entertaining and action-packed popcorn movie. Good time guaranteed.	2003-08-26

After all, this isn't a travelogue memoir like the author's previous two books. No, this book is nothing like what the author has done before. What Krakauer gives us here is a very interesting treatise about religion and the effect it can have on the world.<br />Krakauer uses the 1980s murders done by two of the Lafferty brothers (Ron and Dan murdered the wife and daughter of their brother Allen because they believed they had been instructed to do so by God) to explore the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Not only does he concentrates on the murders - which were a turning point for this movement - but he also explores the birth of the movement as well as the important historical events that shaped Mormonism. <br />Krakauer tries hard to differentiate the modern Mormons from the Fundamentalists (Mormons who are trying to return to the old ways and scriptures to reinstate things like polygamy). Mormons believe that faith is the answer to all problems in life and that one can get the answers needed through prophecies, or messages from God. The author shows how blinding religious beliefs can be, especially in an ever-increasing movement like this one (there are over 10 million Mormons today, making it one of the biggest modern religious movement).<br />Krakauer doesn't go for the visceral. Instead, he takes his time to prove his point, supporting himself with historical facts and quotes from important books and treatises. Through the book, we see the birth, the rise and the possible downfall of a religious movement. <br />In the end, when Krakauer comes back to the original murders, one can better understand the Lafferty brothers, especially after having read the overview of the Mormon movement. In the end, Under The Banner of Heaven becomes a scary and very affecting read that leaves you feeling a bit uneasy about the things it discusses. Faith can be blinding, and ina movement that is based on prophecies like this one, faith can be deadly.	2003-08-20

Well, the first half of it sure reads like it. Is it a horror novel? The second half reads like one. Mix in a lot of drama, great suspense and very interesting and odd characters and you end up with a book that has a little something for everyone. <br />Michael Gruber's first novel is full of originality. In it, we find Jane Doe (yes, that is her real name), an anthropologist who is now living a life in hiding and constant fear. She is living with a little girl she has abducted and now treats as her own daughter. She is running away from her husband, who might now be back looking for her to finish something that he started a long, long time ago.<br />Paz is a cop who is thrown into a murder investigation that seems just too extraordinary to be real. Pregnant women and their unborn child are being murdered in a rutualistic manner. And all the murders seem to be pointing to the same man; Jane's husband, a poet name De Witt, a sorcerer who is seeking revenge for his kind.<br />Spells, dark magic, vodoo and some very intense moments fills the last half of this book. But the real magic here is Gruber's writing. Written in the first person (for Jane), third person (for Paz) and through diary entries that take through the African jungle and back, Gruber takes us through a very original world that is full of magic and originality. You never know what's real and what's not. You never know what to believe and what not to believe.<br />And the fact that Paz and Jane are very original characters that you don't always like just adds to the story's mystic charms. You don't always agree with these two, but you nonetheless want to follow them until the very end.<br />Tropic of Night is a very promising debut by a bright new voice. I can't wait to read Gruber's next. This is one man with a very promising career facing him.	2003-08-16

The story in itself is very simple but so well executed and complemented with such a great protagonist that you will soon find yourself completely lost into Hamilton's brilliant narrative.<br />Told in the first person, the book has us follow Alex McKnight, an ex-cop who retired when he was nearly killed while on the job. Now, many years later, he's a private investigator for a small-town lawyer. When the lawyer and Alex's best friend, Edwin, find themselves stuck in the middle of a murder investigation, Alex has no other choice but to help his friend and boss. But he soon realizes that the killer might have something else in mind: revenge.<br />The muderer seems to be a man named Rose, the very same man who nearly killed Alex so many years ago. When Rose begins terrorizing Alex's friends, Alex will have to try to find the murderer before he kills again, and before Alex becomes the only suspect in the investigation.<br />Suspenseful and brilliantly written, A Cold Day In Paradise in one small novel that never disappoints. In facts, it leaves you craving for more. There are no big shoot-out scenes in this novel, no car chase or chase through the woods. What you do have is a reserved thriller that is all about intelligence. Hamilton isn't going for the visceral. Instead, he takes his time to weave a tale that is all about its characters. It's hard to find a PI novel that isn't just about plot. And the fact that you sympathise and care for Alex, one of the best PI character to come along since Connelly's Harry Bosch, is only icing on the cake. <br />Although the book does fall victim to the first-novel jitters (too many internal questions and dialog, and at times trying too hard with the similes), all of it is quickly forgotten when you realize how brilliantly crafted this little novel is. At one point, the novel seems to be over, but then it picks up again and veers in a new direction (once more because of its characters). The book is full of small surprises like that.<br />A Cold Day In Paradise is a very solid first effort by an author that shows a lot of promise. A great, fast read.	2003-08-11

With his sophomore effort, Night of the Werewolf (following the highly original and very scary Night of the Beast), Shannon proves that he is one of the most innovative new voices in horror fiction. Night of the Werewolf is a fun ride that delivers everything a good pulp horror novel should, and more!<br />Case and Kate meet under strange circumstances. Both of them are looking for missing people and their paths cross in Vegas. When they decide to investigate together, their invstigation brings them to the smalle desert town of Salt Lick, where they will uncover one dark secret that will bring death their way. <br />Salt Lick is your typical small-horror-story-town, where everyone seems strange, where everyone seems to be hiding secrets. And what a secret it is. Case and Kate soon find themselves trapped in this town that just happens to be infested with a tribe of werewolves. Bringing you back to the very best of the old horror pulp novels, Shannon takes you on a ride that is all ups and no downs. The frantic pacing never stops, and the characters are always intriguing. The dialog is witty and often ironically funny, while the situations, if often over the top, leave you craving for more action. Shannon's werewolves are usually remorseless and vicious, always hungry and ready to kill. <br />There is never a dull moment in this novel. Shannon goes all out to make sure he delivers the goods. Although the first half of the book reads more like a mystery novel than an actual horror tale, the second half is everything a horror novel should be and more. The finale is so tense and action-packed, you won't be able to put this one down. <br />I had a great time reading Night of the Werewolf, and I'll bet an arm and a leg that you will too. Shannon weaves his tale with the skill that only masters of the genre are able to generate. He isn't trying to reinvent the werewolf genre. What he wants is to give his readers a great time. By the time you've turn the last page, you'll realize how greatly entertaining Night of the Werewolf truly is. Read this one and be ready for the thrill ride of the year.	2003-08-10

The Da Vinci Code is nothing special; it's a religious mystery that feels a little too familiar at times. This is one case where the book doesn't live up to all the hype surrounding it.<br />And maybe that's why I was so disappointed by it. We've seen this before, and better. How many time have we followed historians or archeologists who are seeking the Holy Grail? This time around, we're following historian and art expert Langdon and Sophie, a young French police officer who's grandfather has just been assassinated. Before dying, the old man wrote a strange message in his own blood. Once decrypted, the message will put Landon and Sophie on a road they do not necessarily want to be on.<br />And that's pretty much all there is to it. I love mysteries that make you work for your money. This one didn't. When the characters are faced with a problem, the answer will usually come to them as if falling right from the sky. They never work really hard to achieve their goals. Everything is pure coincidence. The book - and author - believe themselves to be much more clever than they actually are.<br />Their search leads them across France and England, as our two heroes try to find what they seek all the while trying to dodge the police (and their many enemies). I have to admit that the pacing of the books was pretty quick. Written in short chapters, this was one quick read. But maybe a little too quick. I wanted more out of this story. I wanted more complicated characters, situations that were not so easily solved, and a plot that didn't feel so deja vu.<br />In the end, The Da Vinci Code is nothing special, more the product of a great publicity campain than a real innovative thriller. This book almost reads as if it was written with one sole purpose in mind; to become a Hollywood movie. As it now stands, The Da Vinci Code is just another religious conspiracy thriller that is all talk and no action.	2003-08-07

What I am a fan of, actually, is Dan Simmons. He is the only author who can constantly hop genres all the while remaining fresh and appealing to all of his fans.<br />Following his great epic Hyperion/Endymon, Simmons comes back with another mind blowing science-fiction saga. Ilium is as good if not better than its predecessor, and it is bound to become a classic of the genre, because Ilium is like nothing you've read before. Simmons has done the impossible by creaing something completely fresh, new and highly interesting. <br />The book is separated in three major stories that are all loosely linked to one another. The first story is set on earth, where the post-humans are about to discover that there is much more to life than their uncomplicated, empty existence. When three of these post-humans go on a trek to investigate their originators, they will uncover a dark sercret that will threaten everything they thought they knew.<br />The second story concentrates on a group of robot-like Shakespeare-quoting things who are going on a mission to Mars to try and understand why the planet has terraformed itself. But when their mission goes wrong, they will soon be left stranded on this strange planet.<br />And finally, the final story (and most interesting one) is about a scholi (a professor who goes back in history to observe) who is serving as a witness to the greatest battle of all time, the one depicted in Homer's The Iliad. But the scholi will soon realize that one little shift in events can render the whole future uncertain.<br />And this is probably the heart of Simmons's incredible novel. Beautifully written, this book is all about the power of transformation in time, in space and on a personal level. Simmons recreates history and invents a future in a way that no other author has dared to do before. He goes back to the literary classics to create a futuristic world that is highly influenced by the literaryworld of the past. <br />The whole novel finishes on a climactic level that will hopefully be concluded in the next installment, Olympus. But as it now stands, Ilium is a great read. Although the book is big, I gobbled it up in just a few days. I just couldn't put it down. <br />I can't begin to express how original this book is. It's refreshing to see that imgination isn't fully lost in today's world of mediocre publishing. Truly original literature is hard to come by, so grab this one up and be ready to partake in an experience you won't soon forget.	2003-07-31
US	49059365	R3QXAYI8W8D07J	0062771337	35409936	The Waking	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Solid First Effort	Mike Nichols's The Waking is a mystery novel with a soul and a lot of heart. It is not so much concerned with the hows and whos as much as it is concerned with the whys. This is a mystery about characters and about their lives, not so much about the things they have done.<br />After a bad car accident that many believe to be a suicide attempt, Will's wife is in a coma she simply won't live through. This is where the mystery begins. Because Sandy was working for a woman named Billi who is now in prison for drug trafficking and who might also have been involved in the muder of a man with whom Sandy had an affair. <br />The trial soon begins, but the things that are unveiled are about to destroy Will's life and his image of Sandy forever. So many secrets are unearthed that everyone involved will be left bared and wounded. <br />Nichols has a knack for writing human emotions on the page. He knows how to create situations that are involving and intriguing. He also knows how to be sentimental without going overboard, which is exactly why this novel was so successful. This is the kind of plot that could be the basis for an award winning film; the suspense and the characters are that good. But the thing that pulled me away from completely enjoying this book was the writer himself. The book is in dire need of editing. Told in the first person, Nichols's narrator is ingaging and very eloquent. Maybe too eloquent. Nichols often breaks the pacing to bring his readers into long self-analyses that bring very little to the plot and that just seem to make the book drag a little in its down times. <br />And somehow, the writing also came off as a bit repetitive. I had trouble ignoring these flaws in the beginning but, somewhere halfway through the book, I realized that I had completely forgotten about it all since the story was so involving. This is the kind of book that keeps you guessing until the very last page. <br />It is rare to find a mystery that has so much grace and skill.This is a solid first effort from an author who shows a lot of promise.	2003-07-24

Scott Nicholson, author of the very successful The Red Church, first began his career writing short stories. This short story collection assembles some of his quieter, more affecting pieces. And what a collection it is! You will not find a single story that rings false in this book.<br />Two of the best pieces, The Boy Who Saw Fire and Thirst, are two stories set in a strange mythology Nicholson has created. These stories explain the reasons behind rain and wind and the sunset/sunrise. They fully display Scott's great imagination and his skill with words. <br />There are also many ghost stories in this book. Haunted is a traditional haunted house story (every author needs to have one!) and The Three-Dollar Corpse is a strange ghost tale set in a concentration camp. Then, there is also In The Heart of November a very poignant and sad love story set around a ghost.<br />These are only some of the good pieces. The great ones are the ones we should talk about. First, there is Kill Your Darlings, a great little story that borders satire about writers and where they get their ideas. There is also The Vampire Shortstop, a great vampire tale about a little boy who just wants to play baseball. The ending will leave you all choked up.<br />The one story I enjoyed most was Dead Air, about a radio dj who receives calls from a murderer. The story is simple but the characters so likeable and the dialog so witty that I found myself grinning through the whole thing.<br />This is a great collection to have in your personal library. Every story has its own voice and style. Scott will surely become a great name in horror fiction, so you should grab his debut before they're all gone.	2003-07-18
US	49059365	RQT0RJI2I6FT5	0451410866	674038187	Red Rain	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Pushing The Limits of Crime	With his novel Red Rain, author Michael Crow has created a nifty, gritty little thriller that pushes the boundaries of crime to its bleakest state. Although there is a lot of dark humour to be found in his novel, the storyline is so dark and the characters so conflicted that the read itself ends up being very, very dark. Not since Michael Connelly has an author tackled the grittiest side of today's world in such a realistic and affecting way.<br />The novel gives us Luther Ewing, a half-vietnamese, half-black Baltimore detective who also used to be in the army. His nickname? Shooter, a name Luther does live up to; his army training has left him so indifferent to death and violence that he has no problem pulling the trigger whenever he feels the need. <br />This time, Ewing is faced with a drug cartel that is slowly gaining ground in Baltimore. And the cartel's leader just happens to be a Russian man by the name of Vassily, with whom Ewing spent some time during the war. He now has to go undercover and head-to-head against a man that he once considered to be a friend.<br />Filled with colorful but realistic characters, and a very truthful storyline, Red Rain is the kind of novel that makes no apologies for its violence of subject matter. As a matter of fact, the book's title might not be apporpriate enough; it is not a rain a blood that keeps falling through these pages, but a real downpoor. As the body counts keeps getting higher and higher, Luther finds himself sinking deeper and deeper into a remorseless, dark world.<br />Michael Crow is the pen name for an award-winning novelist. I would love to know who that is, because Red Rain is one of the best crime novel to have been published in quite some time. You will admire Ewing, a character you will both love and hate (never try to understand his actions, he's impossible to figure out!), and you will admire the extremely witty dialogue and sharp, quick writing style.<br />There isn't much to hate in this brilliant little novel. I can't wait to see what Crow will bring us next!	2003-07-11
US	49059365	R2E81ELOKSXVCI	0743453344	607521541	The Killing Kind	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Master Of Thrills	John Connolly is the rare kind of author that just seems to get better and better with each new book he writes. His thrillers, masterfully crafted stories full of intriguing subplots that usually end up leaving you breathless, never cease to amaze. Don't start a Connolly novel before going to bed, because you'll never get the chance to get some sleep.<br />We once more find Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker reluctantly trapped in the middle of a murder investigation that is everything except what it appears to be. This time, the victim is a woman Parker used to know. Although her death appears to be a suicide, her family isn't too certain about it. They hire Parker to investigate.<br />What Charlie finds is more terrifying than any nightmare you could imagine. The murder seems to be linked with an old religious sect that ceased to exists decades ago when all its members mysteriously dissapeared. But when a grave filled with bodies is uncovered, the past once more comes to haunt Charlie and everyon involved in the investigation.<br />This is one of the best thriller you will find on your bookstore's shelves. There isn't a dull moment in this book, not a false moment to be found. The characters feel real, talk real, act real, and the plot is always very entertaining and relentless. Connolly is a master at mixing genres, and he does so again with this one. And the fact that Connolly gives us one of the best finale you will ever find in a thriller only makes him better in my book. <br />I can't think of one bad thing to say about this novel. Connolly and his Charlie Parker are already making their quick ascend to the top of the mystery charts. It's great to see that people are finally turning to the very best there is. The Killing Kind is a rare mystery that you won't soon forget. Summer reading at its very best, and very finest.	2003-07-10

Trying to compete with the new, very popular Europeen flavour (especially with France and their newly-built Eifel Tower), the United States decided that they would host a world fair to amaze the world. After much debate, a vote was taken and Chicago was chosen to host the event.<br />Eric Larson is obviously fascinated with the subject matter at hand. His book gives us the whole history of the fair, from its early stages where the planning was done, to the commitioning of the architects, to the building of the many great structures that would grace the fair grounds, to the opening of the fair, to the building of the first Ferris Wheel, all the way until the closing of the fair. He leaves nothing behind, giving us a complete, hands-on history of the fair that changed the world and giving us, in detail, an account of all the problems the fair had to live through before its grand opening (which almost didn't happen).  <br />Larson gives us a complete background on everyone that was involved in the fair, starting with a man named Burnham, who was the head responsible for everything that took place, as well as other characters such as Bloom and Mr. Ferris himself.<br />But the book also tangles another subject. It was also in this period and in Chicago that one of the most notorious serial killer to ever grace the face of the earth began his mudering spree. A Mr. Holmes (one of his many aliases) murdered at least nine women and children during the fair, although the number is suspected to be much higher. Forget Hannibal Lecter, this is the real-life monster that should be haunting your dreams. <br />Mixing suspense with real life drama, Devil In The White City doesn't read like a nonfiction book. It reads like a great tale of suspense that never ceases to thrill and amaze the reader. This can only be attributed to Larson's talents as a writer and researcher. His writing is so affecting that it's often hard to put the book down.<br />Devil In The White City is a rare kind of book that you will not soon forget. Summer reading at its very best.	2003-07-07

It is a great piece of post-apocalyptic drama that is reminescent of some of the best end-of-the-world stories every published.<br />Alex Garland (author of the amazing novel The Beach) and director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) have teamed up to offer us a one of a kind experience in fear and terror. Here, a man wakes up in a deserted hospital in the middle of an empty London. Everyone has vanished. Everyone, that is, save for a group of people who look like monsters that feed on human flesh. These are the infected, the last survivors of a plague that has wipe off most of England's population. Coming in contact with a single drop of infected blood can be enough to turn you into a monster, which only takes 10 to 20 seconds to happen. The threat is there and very real. <br />The few unlucky souls that managed to survive have now become the prey, the hunted. Jim teams up with a young woman and a father/daughter duo as they try to figure a way out of this whole mess.<br />Garland is a born storyteller. Here, he uses the zombie narratives to address more pressing issues. Often, it is not the zombies that are the biggest threat to our few survivors, but other normal humans. This is one horror story that is all about human nature, a story that places characters before plot.<br />In the end, this story will affect you in amazing ways. This is not a story to take lightly. Nor is it a story that you will soon forget. 28 Days Later is a rare masterpiece in terror.	2003-07-07

This group consists of writers who are writing fiction of the imagination; not fantasy, not sci-fi, not horror. Just imagination. Caroll has been a leader of this group, with novel after novel that are both touching, profound and, yes, very imaginative. <br />Unfortunately, every great author meets a speed bump at one point in his carreer. White Apple isn't a bad book; it is full of philosophical ideas and lessons in morality that are all very interesting to read. But in the end, the book falls a little bit short, never achieving the levels of greatness that his other novels have in the past.<br />Vincent Ettrich has died. But somehow, he is brought back to life. Why? For the sole purpose of love. In his new life, he must come face to face with a lover, Coco, and with the love of his life, Isabella, who is now also pregnant with his child. Unfortunately, some people aren't happy to see Ettrich alive. One of them, Chaos, will do anything to ruin his chance at happiness. Another one is one of Vincent's old co-worker who also died and who is now set on putting a stop to the happy reunions. They will follow Vincent through purgatory and through the maze of memory to try and stop him.<br />There are long sections about the power of love and its meaning, long sections about the power of life and its meaning. And yet, in the end, you never really end up learning anything except that Carroll has a great vivid imagination. <br />One thing Carroll knows how to do is to write great vivid characters. And he knows how to decribe scenery with beautiful prose. But overall, there was something lacking in this book, the very punch that made his other novels so memorable. A good effort, just not a great one.	2003-06-14
US	49059365	R2PNBR5YP7RG83	0312272057	433455404	Dry: A Memoir	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Another Inspiring Chapter	When Augusten Burroughs published his childhood memoir, Running With Scissors, he took the world by storm with his wit, cynicsm and dry humour. Now, Burroughs takes us into yet another dark chapter of his life, his twenties, the greater part of which he spent drunk and high on cocaine. <br />Burroughs bares his heart and soul on the page; he keeps nothing hidden from his reader. And that's exactly what makes this autobiography stand above the rest. Burroughs is so brutally honest that you don't always end up liking him. As a matter of fact, he often seems very shallow and arrogant on the page. <br />And yet, even with all his flaws, you also end up caring for Burroughs a lot. The novel starts when Burroughs is told by his employer (he's a an advertising editor) that he needs to go to rehab or he loses his job. There, he befriends a group of strange characters that will help him through his hard time.  When he is finally released from rehab, he isn't fully ready for what is waiting for him on the other side: the real world.<br />For starters, his best friend is HIV positive and slowly dying. Secondly, he falls in love with a man who is still an addict and who's life is just one big mess. And then, there's the temptation, which is always present, always threatening.<br />But don't be fooled. The book isn't as dark as it appears to be on the surface because you know, after having read his previous biography, that Burroughs has a strong character and that he'll somehow find a way through this all. And the fact that he uses humour to alleviate the dark moments helps make this one very fascinating and involving read.  <br />This is what a biography should be like; funny, touching, inspiring. It is beautifully written and lives up to the standards of the amazing Running With Scissors, something that isn't easy to do(it was one of the best memoirs I have ever read). Dry is a one of a kind memoir that will stay with you for a long time. Not to be missed! It will surely be one of the best book of the year.	2003-06-08

Books	4	16	25	N	N	Freedom Of Speech	Something wonderful happens when a person who has strong beliefs about something decides to speak his or her mind. True, Michael Moore is far from being unopionated. As a matter of fact, his opinions can be so strong at times that he often goes against what he believes in by refusing others their own beliefs and ideas (my worst nightmare would probably consists of me being trapped in some kind of debate with Moore... There would be not way for me to win!). And yet, Moore pulls off yet another masterpiece with Stupid White Men... a book that is both funny and disturbing in the way it awakens us to the reality of the world.<br />Moore isn't afraid to say what he thinks to be \\"right\\". There is very little room for the \\"wrong\\" here. Of course, Moore has a thing to say against the government. And against the world as a whole. And yet, even when you don't really agree with him, you can't argue against his points either because everything is so well researched that there seems to be very little room for error.<br />Stupid White Men is the kind of book that makes you open your eyes to the stupdity that can be found in this world gone bad. After reading this one, you just want to go out and do something to make a difference. And that is the sign of a real socialist; someone who isn't afraid to speak his mind and who will stop at nothing to make himself heard. <br />My hat goes off to Moore.	2003-06-03

A killer is killing young women and stealing their body parts. When the killer is finally caught and killed, police detective Joshua Brolin thought that the nightmare was over.<br />Flashforward a year later, where a new killer is on the loose. Only, this new killer is murdering young women just like the other one did, and all the evidence seems to point to the fact that the killer would infact be the dceased Leeland Beauman, whom Joshua killed a year ago. Even worst, this new killer seems to be going after the young Juliette, the young woman who would have been Leeland's last victim had Joshua not intervened. <br />Chattam has studied criminology, and he knows profiling and the way of a killer's mind like the back of his own hand. This book is very complex, at times feeling like a criminology lecture more than a fiction novel. Then agian, it is this very attention to details and facts that makes this read so incredible.<br />The only thing I have to reproach the story is that the killer's presence is not manifested as much as it should be. I would have liked a more potent killer, a killer who's presence was felt on every page. <br />But as it stands, L'Ame du Mal is a very complex and well crafted thriller that is filled with twists and turns. You'll never guess the ending, and you can't help but like the very vivid characters. A great read!	2003-05-27

Not that there's anything fundamentally wrong with the story itself. As a matter of fact, the whole thing moves quite smoothly, and the plot has some very good twists at times. But in the end, you just can't help but feel that you've seen it all before. You can't help but feel that King could have pushed his story just one step higher to see it reach the potential that was - and is - there. <br />I have to admit that I very much liked the novel's main character, Max Freeman, a retired cop who left everything behind after a near-fatal accident that left him mentally exhausted. Now, he's retired to a small shack in the woods where he tries to live the peaceful, reclusive life. Max is a simple man, the kind of character you instantly like. He's the every day guy trapped in extraordianry circumstances (the all-American every day hero). <br />While on one of his morning boat rides, he finds the body of a dead child wrapped tightly in a blanket. And from there on, Max tumbles down into a nightmarish world where he will soon become the prime suspespect in an on-going murder investigation. <br />This isn't a book that is all about the murders. No, there isn't much that is gruesome of repulsive in this one. Instead, the book concentrates on its main character and the way this whole mess affects him. Because, as he joins in the investigation and befriends a group of men that might very well know a lot about the investigation, Max is also plagued by the many nightmares of his past life as a cop. The most beautiful and touching moments come in the long flash back sequences that feel both nostalgic and like a complete nightmare for Max and the reader both. <br />The book is written in first person prose that is very sparse and effectively simple. King knows that he is writing a thriller and doesn't try to go for pretenses. And he also knows how to describe action; this book had some of the most vivid descriptions I've read in a long time, making the reading of The Blue Edge Of Midnight all that more pleasurable. <br />But in the end, I can't honestly say that I feel like I've read something great. Which kinda makes me sad. Maybe the book needed to offer more challenges in the murder investigation. Or maybe the whole thing needed just a few more twists to make this one stand above the rest. Or maybe the ending could have been just a little better. But as it stands, The Blue Edge Of Midnight is a nice beach book that you'll enjoy while it lasts.	2003-05-20

You should not expect to find a mere escapist tale in Mattew Pearl's The Dante Club. Because this is one mystery suspense masked by a high literary quotient that makes the reading of the book very challenging and yet completely satisfying.<br />This book takes you back to the 1800s, just as the first translation of Dante's famous Italian Poem The Divine Comedy is being done. The poem was truly translated in this period by a group of men belonging to what was then known as the Dante Club and later became the Dante Association. <br />But with his novel, Pearl has concoted an intricate murder mystery that is centered around the poem itself. Someone is killing men in Boston in a way very similar to that which is described in Dante's poem. Now this group of professors and literary men must discover the killer before the truth is unearthed and the poem becomes banned forever, as many have tried to do.<br />Pearl knows his way with words, and he knows how to craft a plot so restless and intriguing that it grabs its readers by the gut and keeps squeezing with each new page. And he is even able to give his reader somewhat of a small lecture on Dante throughout the novel, giving us long anlysis of the amazing poem (as told through the characters themselves).<br />I do not recommend this book to someone looking for a breezy read. The Dante Club is the kind of novel that you have to take your time reading. It is drenched in historical data, and factual annecdotes that aren't always obvious on the surface. The author's prose is both complicated and beautiful, almost poetic. He is able to give us a lot on Dante without ever denying us the thrills that should be delivered by a mystery tale.   <br />The Dante Club is a great read that will leave you feeling both rewarded and exhilarated in the end.	2003-05-16

It seems that they always have to have some sort of theme to link the stories together. That's why I was so pleased with William P. Simmons's Vivisections; this is one anthology that isn't about theme. It isn't about trying to link the stories together in a coherent way. It's about presenting great horror stories that touch the entire spectrum. <br />Here, you will find horror's top new voices (and some old ones) doing what they do best: scare us. The best stories in this one come from Scott Nicholson (Doomsday's Diary), Gary A. Braunbeck (Duty), Tim Lebbon (Unto Us) and Michael Laimo (The Rash). These are four of the best authors in the field right now, and their stories are not to be missed. See the pros at their very best.<br />But an anthology is also a great way to discover new talents, a thing Vivisections did quite well. Simon Wood's Warning Signs is a fun, holds-no-barrels story that delivers the goods. Ron J. Horsley's The Theater At The End Of The World is a nostalgic piece that is both dream and haunting. And Dean H. Wild's The Kid is a very affecting little story that is powerful on a psychological level.<br />It's rare to find an anthology where you can call all the stories good or great. There isn't a single bad story in this one; just a few stories that are a little less good compared to the amazing ones to be found in these pages. <br />Vivisection is the first of what will probably become one of horror's most celebrated anthologies. Don't let the first installment pass you by. There is a piece for every taste in this great anthology.	2003-05-03

It was written for the sole purpose of entertaining its audience, something it does quite well in fact. This over-the-top thrill-a-minute ride is so entertaining that it makes you keep on turning the pages. <br />The book concerns the little voices you often hear in your head. In this case, they are real entities that are residing inside the head of their host. The hosts are called gatherers. Alex is one of them. But you also have hunters, people that can only hold one other resident inside their heads. The hunters are violent and hungry for mayhem. <br />Add to this mix a security guard who's on the trail of the serial killer that has entered the mind of a hunter, and you get a bloodythrill ride that never has a dull moment.<br />I really liked the characters and they way they acted and spoke. The dialogue is amazingly witty and real. This book has it all; suspense, horror, mystery... It seems that the whole of it could easily have come crashing down. The book is very busy at time, so busy in fact that you sometimes have trouble following what everyone is doing. But amazingly enough, every time the story blurs a little, Lukac brings everything back into focus.<br />Oogie Boogie Central is like one of those great B-movies that you want to keep watching over and over again, but with a little more heart and style. I really enjoyed the ride it gave me, and probably won't soon forget it either.	2003-04-28

It needs more. It needs a solid beginning. It needs solid characters. And it needs adequate pacing and plotting to keep your interest through the whole thing. Dennis Lehane never had a problem with this before. As a matter of fact, his Mystic River was one of the best myseteries of the last decade (if not THE best). But with Shutter Island, he tried something different, moving out of the dark mystery field to create a hybrid story. Maybe he should have stuck with what he's best known for...<br />Here, we have a detective who goes to the state prison/asylum on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearence of a female patient. Only, he and his partner stumble on something greater, something darker, and something that very might spell their demise.<br />Saying too much about the plot would be to ruin a quick and slightly entertaining story, because everything seems to serve the ending. Yes, this is a book that reads well and fast. Yes, it does provide many very entertaining moments, and moments of intense suspense. But in the end, all of that just wasn't enough to save this book.<br />Lehane is trying to up his position on the crime fiction list with this one. But this book does very little to prove to readers that he's the best at what he does. And yes, the book does have a great twist ending that you might or might not see coming, but that either isn't enough to save the book.<br />In the end, Shutter Island is a slightly entertaining effort from an author capable of much better. I wanted more out of these characters and the situations they find themselves in. There is a lot of potential behind this story, but because the characters are so thin, it is never achieved. I wanted more out of the plot (the book is barely 300 pages long!). And I wanted more overall from Lehane.	2003-04-22

It also feels like sci-fi yarn. And, most of all, it's also a horror book. That's why I enjoyed reading this one so much; it gives you the best of all worlds! <br />Here, we find Frank, a detective who, during his weekend off, stumbles upon one heck of a conspiracy. It all starts when he follows a trail of blood that leads him to a mangled corpse. And then, right in front of his very eyes, a bald man wearing sunglasses comes to steal the body away. <br />Frank starts investigating with the detective given the case, Hector, who also happens to be his old boss. Together, they stumble on an age-old mystery involving aliens and a great deal of murders. Saying any more than that about the plot would be giving away  too much. To enjoy Atmosphere, you have to go in without knowing much about the plot and about the characters. <br />Laimo knows how to grab his readers from the start. After reading the very first page, I just couldn't put the book down. The story is fast-paced and so entertaining that you'll find yourself reading long past your bed time. <br />I love books that take a familiar story and makes it new again. People have been writing about aliens for years; but this one puts a neat twist on it that involves young males and techno music. And Laimo does not shy away from the gore; although the book is never too graphic, it does have many moments of high tension that usually result in a lot of blood being shed. <br />Atmosphere is a very entertaining read that will keep you guessing until the end. It has vivid characters and a very intricate plot. It has comic scenes, scenes of tense horror, and very touching moments. What more could you want fom an escapist fare?	2003-04-15

He's up there with the likes of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. His Harry Bosch is one of the best, most engaging cop/PI/investigator since the noir years in the 50s and 60s. You know that when you start a Harry Bosch novel, you won't want to let go of it until you turn the very last page.<br />That's why Lost Light is a little bit disappointing. Not that it's a bad book. It's classic Connelly; it reads quickly, the writing is sharp, the dialogue even sharper and the plot moves quickly. Only thing is, Connelly has done this before, and better. <br />In Lost Light, we find Bosch investigating the murder of a young woman who worked as a production assisstant on a movie. That very movie is also under scrutiny, as it was the setting for a 2 million dollar heist that is still unresolved. Mix to this a missing FBI agent and you've got more than enough to keep your mind busy for 360 pages. But the plot itself is quite predictable. You can easily predict Bosch's next step. There are very few surprises for the reader in Lost Light  <br />The one intersting thing is that, for the very first time, Connelly chose to write the book in the first person. And I have to admit that it suits the book and the character well. It was great to finally get into Bosch's mind, see how he thinks, what he does. I just love the way this character thinks and acts. He feels so real on the page that he just seems to creep right out of the book.<br />You can see that Connelly is trying to bring his character in a new direction now that he is retired. And retirement works well for Bosch. I liked him a lot as a cop, but I like him even more as a retired PI. And the very last pages of the book offers a surprise that will probably change Bosch quite dramatically in the future.  <br />Lost Light isn't a bad book. Far from it, it can be quite entertaining at times. But Connelly has done this before with his earlier books. Maybe I would haveliked more surprises, or maybe a bigger payoff in the end. It would only have been fitting that, because Connelly uses the first person for the first time, Lost Light would have been a breaking point in the series. Unfortunately, it isn't. As it is, Lost Light does provide a few hours of entertainment, if only that.	2003-04-08

And yet, reading this was the most fun I've had in a while. This is a noir story that goes back to the earlier times of crime fiction, where the likes of Raymond Chandler ruled the genre. <br />This gritty tale of crime is full of twists and turns and surprises. The book has everything you'd dream of finding in a crime novel; sex, drugs, alcohol, violence and, of course, lots and lots of money. Here, we have an attorney, Charlie, who's spending his last night in the city. Christmas eve, during one heck of a freezing rain/snowstorm (and you can imagine the many great gags that emerge out of this situation).<br />Charlie works for people with lots of money, who own lots of bars and strip joints all across town. But Charlie has a secret. He's stolen a great deal of money from his bosses, and now he wants to leave his life behind and take the money with him. Of course, many people do not want to see him succeed and will try to stop him at all cost.<br />The Ice Harvest has a very simple plot. And yet, you can't help yourself, you just want to keep on turning the pages. I loved the characters in this book, especially Charlie, who's your anti-hero par excellence. There is as much to hate as there is to love in him. His choices are often amoral and yet, you also feel sympathy for him in the strangests of times. <br />The book is full of very colorful characters who all end up serving purpose to the plot. Phillips is a born storyteller; from the very first page, he takes you by the hand to bring you along a very wild and very fun ride. He knows when to end a storyline and starts a new one, when to end a joke before it gets old, or when to make a character disappear because he or she simply isn't needed anymore. This, you would only find in a master storyteller, so it is quite surprising to find these qualities in a first novel. <br />If there is one complaint I have about the book, it would be its length. Maybe I would have liked to see more. Then again, I'm not sure that anymore subplot would have helped the narrative. In any case, as it is, The Ice Harvest is a nifty little book that does exactly what it sets out to do; to bring you a few hours of much deserved, much sought-after entertaiment. What more could you want from a crime novel?	2003-04-03

Author of the great collection Bad Seed and of numerous short stories (ALL OF THEM GREAT, I have to add), Shannon's first novel does everything except disappoint. It is a horror tour de force that brings you back to what horror is all about; being scared and having one heck of a great time!<br />An evil force settles over a small American town, taking every citizen in its thrall. This evil thrives on bad dreams and nightmares, on fears and sadness. It plays with your mind in the worst of ways, making you see and experience your most darkest, inner fears.<br />It is up to Rourke and a few other citizens (like Maggie, the young woman who steals Rourke's heart and her brother Michael, Timmy, a little boy who's family is about to be touched by the evil, and the Sheriff himself, a man who's demons are too powerful to withhold) to try and put a stop to the strange things happening all around them. But how do you fight an evil that can't be seen? An evil that gets you when you least suspect it?<br />Night of The Beast is classic horror at its best. But the most surprising thing about the book is how Harry Shannon is able to take you right into these characters' minds, to make you feel and experience everything they feel. It's a rare thing to find a horror book where the writing seems to be singing to you.<br />Night of the Beast does for this small town what Stephen King did to his Castle Rock. It is a story with dozens of characters, all of them believable, all of them completely real. Their lives become entangled in this nightmare, up to the final, amazing finale that will leave you breathless. Don't read Night of the Beast in the Dark. Or better yet, do! This is one frigthening story I won't soon forget!  <br />And mark this name in your mind: Harry Shannon. You will see much more of him in the future, you can be sure of that. With this kind of talent, the guy is bound to break through at any time.	2003-03-31

Not that the book is highly original. It's a very basic cop-after-killer story. What makes it stand out so much is the world Santlofer brings us into, and his heroine, who you will both love and hate.<br />Kate is an ex-cop turned art critic who is suddenly thrown in the middle of a murder case when her protege is savagely murdered. And the killer is far from done; he will kill many more victims, all of them members of the art world, all of them murdered in a way depicting a classical painting.Kate is quickly given a temporary PD license so that she can assist the police force in the investigation. <br />The book is filled with dozens of characters, all of them eccentric and original. You'll never have any problem differentiating them. Each and everyone becomes a suspect, even Kate's big-shot attorney husband. There are many characters you'll just love to hate. Even Kate, with her strong head but penchant for fashion and looks, isn't all that likeable at times.  <br />It's evident that Santlofer knows the world he is writing about. The locations, the dialogue and the situations are all very vivid. And what the plot lacks in originality, it regains in characterization and pacing. The novel moves along at the speed of a bullet; there is never a dull moment in The Death Artist. <br />The Death Artist also gives us a very original killer. Short scenes from his point of view are scattered across the book, turning the narrative into a very chilling and engaging piece of suspense.<br />The Death Artist is a great debut by a talented painter and writer. I can't wait to read Santlofer's next book!	2003-03-26

After all, it did take him fourty years to write it. This very short book (it can barely be called a novel) contains stories Bradbury wrote in the 40s and 50s, linked with more modern pieces from this great author's imagination. And yet, I have to admit that the book didn't much for me. <br />The story itself concerns a family of monsters and ghosts who assemble from time to time in the great family mansion. The subtitle says it all; this IS a family remembrance. We come to learn about each member of the family; their stories, the sadness, their pain. And some of these stories were quite entertainin. Cecy and uncle Einar have great histories, but many of the other characters don't.<br />As I read each of these short, short stories (some barely a page long), I couldn't help but feel that the book was getting a little repetitive after a while. But just when I was about to give up, Bradbury comes and delivers a very touching and affecting finale that will bring a smile to your lips.<br />What saves this book from being just another horror novel is Bradbury's beautiful poetic style. His words flow so smoothly that you'll often find yourself lost in his narrative. But besides that, there isn't much that is greatly memorable about From the Dust Returned. I enjoyed it while it lasted, but that's pretty much it. Is this Bradbury's masterpiece? Not by a long shot. It's midly entertaining, while it lasts.	2003-03-19
US	49059365	R3OV72TP7PRC1W	0812522095	401940783	Walkers	Books	3	8	8	N	N	Horror at its fastest!	When it comes to horror, Graham Masterton has done it all, and quite successfully. Walkers is considered by many to be one of Masterton's most entertaining and most horrific efforts. And entertaining it is. Written at the end of the 1980s, when the big horror boost of that decade was waning, Walkers is a hold-no-barrels horror story that is all about pace. And blood.<br />The story gives us Jack, the All-American father who stumbles upon an old building on a dark, rainy night. He falls in love with the building and decides he wants to buy it to turn it into a resort hotel. Only, the building is still inhabited, and the people living there aren't quite ready to give away their home.<br />Ghosts? Not really. They are walkers, people who are trapped between two worlds. They come to the surface by merging into walls. But when they are accidentally set loose, the world itself will be faced with the most dangerous kind of monsters. And even worst, they kidnap Jack's son in the hopes of sacrificing him. A high body count ensues, and a race against time begins. <br />Is the book fun? Yes, brainless fun. Is the book entertaining? Yes. The suspense is great, the horror is original and the premise is quite fun. But don't expect a masterpiece out of Walkers. The characters are one-dimensional. And every time a secondary character comes into the story, it's not hard to guess what will happen to them. They all end up the same. <br />But what the book lacks in plot and plausibility, it gains in pacing. The whole thing can easily be read in one sitting. It's the kind of book where you just have to let go of all your notions of realism and just go with the flow. If you're capable of doing that, then you'll probably end up having a good time reading Walkers. It's not Masterton at his best, but it's still very entertaining.	2003-03-16

I have to admit that, after reading Nicholson's great short fiction collection Thank You For The Flowers, I was expecting a lot from his debut novel The Red Church. After all, the premise had everything required to churn a good, old-fashioned horror tale: a haunted church, a demonic priest, children in distress and a whole town thrown in the middle of the utlimate battle between good and evil.<br />Where did things go wrong?<br />One thing is for sure: Nicholson knows how to write good suspense. In The Red Church, we find Archer McFall, a preacher who returns to his sleepy home town to reopen the red church, a place that has been standing since the 1860s and who's pass is less than glorious. As Archer rides back into town, everyone seems to be affected by his return. And people start dying. And people start seeing things. And the ghosts dwelling inside the church come alive.<br />Not bad huh? But somehow, the novel isn't all that it's cracked up to be. Maybe that's because Nicholson never gives us any real characters to care for. I just didn't believe these people. Their actions were typical of the B-movie horror film (it seemed to me that they always picked the wrong decision, even when they knew better), and their dialogue often sounded false. Nicholson tries to arouse sympathy in his readers through Ronnie, a young boy who seems to be at the heart of everything, and his dad Dave. But the characters are so bland that you never really care for them. And Nicholson goes a little too heavy on the religious undertones at times. In the end, everyone (even the kids!) seem to be religious fanatics. <br />That said, I have to admit that Nicholson did create some very suspensful scenes in this book. On that takes place under water in a car is particularly affecting. Another that takes place inside a barn will chill you to the bones. But it's still not enough to completely save the book, although it does redeem it to some level.<br />It's unfortunate that The Red Church fellvictim to the first-novel syndrome, because it did show a lot of potential. Maybe Nicholson's next effort will be the great horror novel he is more than capable of writing.	2003-03-10

He's like our own version of Charles Dickens. People say that every writer has his own magus opus, the one thing he is working at achieving during his career. His own, great work. For King, this is without a doubt his Dark Tower series, a series that links every book he has ever written together in one sweeping, epic narrative.<br />Going into the specifics of the series would take too much time and, quite frankly, would be much too arduous. But in this book, we find Roland and his ka-tet (Eddie, Susannah, Jake and Oy) still making their way down to the Dark Tower. Only, this book doesn't really advance the plot. Because this is the part of the story where Roland empties his heart and tells us about his past.<br />And what a dark past that is!<br />Roland takes us back to his first mission, where he left Gilead at the young age of fourteen to go to Mejis to escape the dangers that are growing in the big city. Only, Roland will find greater, more dangerous dangers in Mejis.<br />Upon his arrival, he meets Susan, a beautiful young woman he falls in love with. But like with all great romances, Roland tells us from the very beginning that this is a doomed romance. Over the course of nearly six hundred pages (!!!), Roland recalls his romance with Susan and how his life was nearly destroyed by it. In his story, we encouter a witch, a mild-mannered mayor, coffin hunters (mean, savage cowboy-like individuals), and a whole town filled with strange, interesting and often funny characters (I'm always amazed to see how King can find humor in the darkests of times, just to cheer his readers a little bit when things get too heavy for them).<br />King is a master storyteller. No one else could weave a story like this one, where every word counts, where the slow pace of the narrative is crucial in creating the high levels of drama and suspense the story achieves.<br />Some people might be put off by the fact that this is a going-back-in-time story. But it is a necessary one if you want to really understand who - and what - Roland is all about and the real stakes of his prime goal: reaching the dark tower to stop the world from shifting. And to stop the man in black (the devil himself?).<br />This is classic King, where everything comes to life on the page. Reading one of his book is like having someone by your side telling you a story. The great master of suspense once more outdoes himself. Only problem is, now I just CAN'T wait for the next installment!	2003-03-05

This is exactly what happens to Beau in Douglas Clegg's brilliantly imaginative Neverland, a book that will leave you breathless and in complete awe. <br />Beau, his parents, his infant brother and his twin sisters leave for their annual summer trip down to the family island, where they will stay with Beau's aunt and her family and his grandmother for the following month. When he arrives, his cousin Sumter is already waiting for him. Sumter is a strange boy who has discovered something magical and yet terrifying in the old shack behind the house. A crate with something - or someone - trapped inside. Something that calls itself Lucy.  <br /> Soon enough, Beau finds himself trapped in a nightmare he can't get himself out of. They nickname the shack Neverland, the place where imagination runs free, a place where pain and sadness does not exist. But Neverland grows to be an entity of its own, and it wants something more than mere company. It wants blood.<br />Douglas Clegg's imgination is amazing, and he puts it to full use in this book. The things we used to dream as children - both good dreams and nightmares - come alive in this book. You soon find yourself trapped in playground from hell, where there are very few rules. <br />Beau will have to face his own personal demons as he will be pushed to the very limits of sanity by Sumter and Neverland. The last 150 pages of the book are a real roller coster ride, where everything goes to hell, and where Clegg really shows how great and brilliant his imagination truly is.<br />Not only is Neverland a great horror novel, it is one you won't soon forget. Douglas Clegg is the master of suspense, no dout about it. So do yourself a favor and pick on of his book up. I promise, you won't be disappointed.	2003-02-25

Although the book might have been victim of too much praise and fame - just looking at some of the other reviews proves my point - if given the chance, it slowly creeps up on you emotionally, to leave you completely surprised and breathless by the beauty and realism of the tale.<br />It took me about 100 pages to really get into it. But once I did, I was completely caught by the story. Miles has always lived in Empire Falls, Maine, a small town that is on its way to being yet another forgotten place ever since the town's factory - the place that employed more than half of the town's residents - folded. Miles is the cook and manager at the Empire Grill, the town's only diner, owned by Francine, the old woman who also owns three quarters of the  town. Francine is the kind of woman who thinks that owning the town also means that she owns its citizens, something that isn't far from the truth. <br />Only, Miles isn't happy in Empire Falls. His wife has recently divorced him, his daughter is getting more secretive, his brother is attracting problems as usual, and the past is slowly coming back to haunt him, especially the memories of his deceased mother, a presence that is very much haunting throughout the whole novel. Plus, problems with Francine arise as plans to change the town are revealed.<br />The characters are all very vivid, though I can't confess to understanding them all completely. Especially the relationships between parents and kids. I wasn't keen on the way in which the kids treated their parents in this book. Old people are usually very annoying and ridiculous (this is most obvious in the relationship Miles has with his father Max). Then again, the oparents often are the source of comedy in an otherwise very somber novel.<br />That aside, Empire Falls is a very touching novel from one of America's most poetic and entertaining novelist. This is a literary novel that actually pleases. It has very little pretention, as if Russo was writing this story for anyone who would be willing to spare him a few hours of their time. Never will you forget these characters, nor the very touching and affecting finale. Empire Falls is an all-American novel that shows just how great your life can be, if you just make yourself look a little under the surface of thigns.	2003-02-13

John Grisham began his writing career with a bang, publishing one great legal thriller after the next, a feat that brought him to the top of the publishing world very quickly. But in the last few years, his legal thrillers have been less than steller. Aside from his sweet, heartwarming A Painted House (which, ironically enough, was not a legal thriller), Grisham's novels have been on the boring side. Now, he returns with his yearly offering, a fun little novel called The King of Torts, a novel that brings him once step closer to regaining his title of King of the legal thriller.<br />In the book, we find a young public defendent named Clay, who is given the opportunity to earn 15 million dollars with just a few months's work. Soon enough, he is thrown into the world of mass litigation, where lawyers sue big corportations with thousands of claims. The millions start pouring in and Clay soon finds himself at the top of his game.<br />But what goes up must come down, a thing Clay does not seem to know. Halfway through the story, Clay realizes that he's in way over his head.<br />In Clay, Grisham creates a character you will both love and hate. His rise to success his fun to watch, but his downfall is much more interesting. It's the part in between that's problematic. Because, while Clay is on top, he becomes so obssessed with money and fame that he becomes a character you will despise. It's hard to like someone who's complaining about life when they own a yacht, a million dollar house, a penthouse in the south, and their own 45$ million jet. So when his downfall arrives, it's hard to feel sympathy for Clay.<br />The story is predictable, yet fun to read. Maybe the book would have been better had Clay been faced with harder, more problematic challenges and situations. As it is now, The King of Torts is a fund read that doesn't require much involvement from its readers. A good beach novel, but not much more than that.	2003-02-05

After all, the book is very thin and it comes from a first time author. There are no reviews or quotes on the book imploring its greatness. But from the very first page, I was gripped by the story and by the author's beautiful style. Not only is The Fallen a great horror story, it is also a very literary one at that.<br />Henry Sleep returns to his hometown of Sauls Run when he gets the news that his father has just passed away. It is in that town that Henry's old flame, Emily, still resides and where his once-friend Perry is now holding the reins of the family business.<br />Only, Henry doesn't believe that his father did commit suicide. And his suspicions are confirmed when strange things begins happening in Sauls Run. Saying anymore about the plot would be ruining a very original and very enthralling story. I will only say that you will be hooked from the very first page and that you will not want to see the book end.<br />It's hard to believe that this is Bailey's first book. The writing resembles that of someone who has been doing it for decades. His prose is beautifully descriptive and even poetic at times, which is something that you rarely find in a horror novel. And yet, The Fallen offers fully fleshed characters that you will care about and love. Even the so-called 'bad guys' will evoke some sympathy from you.<br />My only reproach is that the book was too short. I wanted more. I would have taken a lot more. Then again, the pacing is just perfect in The Fallen. There is never a dull moment, but you will get everything you need to know about the characters and their past, everything you'll need to enjoy this perfectly crafted story.  <br />The Fallen is one of those rare gems that takes you my complete surprise. I can't wait to read another book by Dale Bailey. If his next one is half as good as The Fallen was, then we'll be in for yet another great treat!	2003-02-03

Then you'd get the very Neil Gaiman-ish book that is King Rat. China Mieville's freshman effort, a trim, effective little novel is drenched in originality, but maybe a little too much style.<br />Saul returns home after a night of partying to find that his father has been murdered. He becomes the prime suspect. But while in jail, someone comes to bust him out; a strange looking man who can crawl on walls, squeeze through tight spaces and who acts like, well, a rat.<br />This is King Rat, Saul's uncle. And he is about to tell his nephew a very strange tale indeed. Soon enough, Saul becomes a rat man himself, hiding in sewers and living in the darkness of the London underground (much of this seems familiar; British authors seem to have a fascination with the London underground, as Neil Gaiman has proven with his amazing Neverwhere.). <br />But of course, all isn't well in the underground kingdom. Because Saul soon learns that the kingdom's enemy, the Pied Piper, is in town. And it is only when the Piper starts going after Saul's friends that things really get ugly, and bloody. <br />Very original, beautifully described and told, King Rat is a one-of-a-kind novel that practically reads itself. It is an Urban fantasy where violence and darkness seems to reside in every corner you look. It is an engaging read that always keeps you guessing. <br />So it is very unfortunate that the book falls victim to the first-time author disease. The prose is often self-indulgent; too many words are used when just a few would have sufficed. And some of the supportive characters seem to blend together because they are all so similar. But that problem is quickly resolved with the main characters, who are very colorfu, memorable and original.<br />I had a lot of fun reading King Rat. Fans of Neil Gaiman or Charles de Lint should like this one. And the rest of you should find enough originality in here to last you for a long time.	2003-01-31

Mount Dragon and The Relic are amazing tour-de-force novels. But when on his own, Licoln Child can't achieve the same level of greatness that he finds with his partner.<br />The plot of Utopia is much too simple. This is Die Hard meets Jurassic Park, without the suspense and without the thrilling characters. The plot is so simple that you'll guess every twist and turn dozens of pages before they actually occur. There are very few surprises in Utopia, which completely destroys the type of suspense the book is striving to achieve.<br />Even the characters are paper-thin and stereotypical. You have the average-joe computer wiz who will become the Rambo-like savior, and his young daughter, who will become the target. You have the parc's director, a woman who's so ambitious that she can't see a problem when it slaps her right in the face. And finally, you have the inside man, the traitor who initiated the whole thing (and you'll easily guess who that is within the first fifty pages or so!).<br />Imagine yourself on a roller coaster ride. You're all hyped up because it's about to start. When it does, you get all excited. Then the ride stops. Then starts again. Then stops. Then starts again. That's how I felt while reading Utopia. <BR> <BR>As a matter of fact, the books reads more like the outline for the next big special effects summer film than an actual novel. And that's too bad, because the core idea behind the book is somewhat interesting. Child goes through great lengths to create this amazing theme parc and he easily puts us right in there with the characters (although he can babble a bit too much about computers and modern technology). But that's pretty much the only thing to find thrilling about this book.	2003-01-26

When someone edits an anthology, he should be aware of the different tastes in the audience. Unless it is a themed anthology, the stories should reflect a wide spectrum to provide the readers with the best possible entertaiment. A \\"best-of\\" anthology like this one should cover this, as well as present us with both new and established writers. Unfortunately, this edition doesn't come close to answering to these criterias.<br />It's obvious that guest editor James Ellroy has a preference for sports stories. Nearly half of the stories in here are about sports (mostly boxing, which is one of Ellroy's favourites). Not that there's anything wrong with sports stories. It's just that the ones featured here are far from remarkable. Save for Michael Connelly's murder at the baseball game story, and for Thomas Cook's The Fix, none of the sports-themed stories deliver the goods.<br />Fortunately, there are a few stories here that are quite memorable. Joe R. Lansdale always delivers the goods, and his story The Mule Rustlers does not disappoint. Other great stories are Joyce Carol Oates's The High School Sweetheart, Daniel Waterman's A Lepidopterist's Tale, Stuart M. Kaminisky Sometimes Something Goes Wrong, Sean Doolittle's Summa Mathematica and John Biguenet's It Is Raining in Bejucal. <br />That's only seven good stories out of the twenty that are found in this anthology. If these stories really represent the best stories of 2002, then it was a pretty bad year for mystery fiction!<br />And it would have been nice if Ellroy could have added more new writers. All the featured writers here save for one have published more than one book. I love an anthology that makes you discover new writers. This one didn't do that either. I can't say that I recommend this new edition of The Best Mystery Stories. Otto Penzler is a great editor, maybe he should think about taking the reins of the next one himself.	2003-01-24

Then he moved into the Jurassic Park field, where he terrorized us with a nature-runs-amock plot. But ever since he tangled with corporate law in Disclosure, Crichton's efforts have been less than stellar. Airframe was lame and boring, and Timeline was long-winded and not very exciting. But I'm happy to say that the real Crichton, the Jurrasic Park and Andromeda Strain Crichton is back. And boy is this a great welcome party!<br />Of course, he does not let go of his favorite theme; nature vs. mankind. In Prey, a family man named Jack (can you have a more average-joe name?) is thrown into a virtual nightmare when he is brought to the Nevada desert to help a research group with a problematic new technology.<br />This group, led by Jack's wife (who is now in the hospital after a serious car accident), has developped small camera-like atom particles that can run in minuscule places (like the human body for example) to take pictures. Only, they have come to realize that their strain has begun evolving on its own and that one of them has escape. And soon enough, they find themselves faced with something much more dangerous: a computerized plague that kills remorselessly everything that comes on its path.<br />Crichton is great at writing high-adrenalyn suspense scenes. Prey does not disappoints. The moment Jack steps foot in the desert, the tension starts building. And building. And building. The levels of suspense are so great at times that it's just impossible to put the book down. This is a littke like John Carpenter's The Thing, set in the desert with a lot of technological mumbo-jumbo talk. But fortunately, Crichton's technological writing is done in a way that almost everyone will be able to follow without getting lost in all the high-tech talk. <br />If you can get passed Crichton's simplistic writing (sometimes, much too simplisitc) and corny dialogue, what you'll find is a thrill ride that'll make you bite your nails to the bone. Prey isn't a great novel. It's fun, action-packed and highly entertaining. Everything you've come to expect from a good Crichton yarn, and more.	2003-01-19

Running with Scissors is one of those rare biographies that grabs you both intellectually and emotionally. The characters are so far-off the normal scale, so exotic and erratic, that you just want to keep on turning the pages just to see what they'll do next. Augusten Burroughs shares with us his difficult and odd childhood, and does so in a way that you can't help sympathize with him.<br />Burrough's life could never be described as normal. His mother, a failed poet, is often depressed, which often leads to long bouts of erratic behaviour. Because of that, she divorces her husband and then decides that she can no longer take care of her son. She 'gives' him to her psychologist, Dr. Finch, a strange, santa claus-looking fellow who eventually becomes Burrough's legal guardian.<br />Augusten moves in with the Finch family. Here, he encounters Hope, a woman nearing thirty who has a heart of gold but who's character is very, very strange. There is Agnes, on of the doctor's many wives, who cleans the house at midnight and eats kibbles and bits as a snack. He meets Neil, who enventually becomes his lover. And finally, he meets Natalie, a girl only a year older than him who will soon become his one and only true friend.<br />While Augusten tries to cope with the strange behavior in the Finch household, and while he tries to cope with his own sexual identity crisis, Agusten has to deal with his mother's psychological problems.<br />By the time he's fifteen, Augusten has seen more, done more and experienced more than most fourty year olds. But Burroughs never seems sorry for what he's been through. There is a humorous tone that runs through the book that makes the reading of these heavy stories more touching and likeable. <br />Running with Scissors is a book that you won't be able to stop reading, but that will stay in your mind for a long time. These are memorable, if extremely strange and peculiar characters you won't soon forget. A sweet coming-of-age tale, and a very strange tale of abuse is what you will find in Running with Scissors.	2003-01-15

This Symbiotic Fascination was nominated for a Stoker award as well as a few more horror fiction awards. The book has been praised for its darkness, grossness, violence, beautiful prose... It seems that everyone in the horror field loves this book. So I ask you, what's all the fuss about?<br />This Symbiotic Fascination offers nothing new. The book is overwrought and its long-winded prose is often distracting. I have to admit that I didn't enjoy reading this book. Not because it's too violent (it's not- I've see much worse), not because it's too original (it's not - It's yet another vampire story), not because it's too dark (it's not - some authors have done the dark thing way better), but because it really has nothing to say.<br />The story is about two very strange characters. Tawne is an overweight woman who's shy, reserved and who never knew the full meaning of popularity. She is fascinated by beauty and wishes herself beautiful. Her wish is about to be answered when she is tortured and then made into a creature of the night by a strange shape-shifting man.<br />Tawne's infatuation revolves around a man named Arcan. He's dark, brooding, violent. He enshrouds more than one personality (its seems that he's part man, part animal. He has raped and brutalized many women, and the guilt of it all is slowly ravaging him whole. <BR>These two characters are brought together, both becoming part of the undead world. But the thing is, you never care or feel for these two. In any book (even a horror novel), you need a character you can sympathize with. That doesn't meed that you need to love the character. You just needs someone who's experiences you can share and maybe even identify with. But Tawne is just a winy woman who needs to be pulled out of the misery state she's inducing on herself (her self-pity is just annoying at times). And Arcan... Well, there isn't much to love there either.<br />Jacob tries too hard to stuff as much as she can in her vampire novel. She even introduces a plot about a video tape that makes people go insane. As interesting as this plot is, it goes nowhere and just ends up feeling superfluous. <br />I understand that Jacob is primarily a poet. It shows in her writing. Her prose is often beautiful in its descriptions. Only, she has a tendency to over-describe everything. She has pages after pages of rambling that just slows down the pace of the book.<br />I love horror fiction. I love a good story that is original and interesting. I love a story that can frighten you, a story that can make you care about the characters even if they really are to be despised for the things they do. That said, it took me everything I had to finish this book. Nothing about this book really intrigued me. The story feels tired. It's been done before by better authors (Ed Lee, Jemiah Jefferson, Poppy Brite) much better. Reading This Symbiotic Fascination was a great disappointment. I just hope that Jacob's next effort will live up to the fuss.	2003-01-13
US	49059365	R5ZKXAYYD23OM	0399149244	81364874	Tricky Business	Books	3	2	2	N	N	It's all too familiar.	When Big Trouble was published a few years ago, it felt like a mix of the best of Carl Hiaasen and Elmore Leonard. Big Trouble was entertaining, had quirky characters and, most importantly, was gut-wrenching funny. Now, Dave Barry is back with Tricky business. And although the novel has an interesting premise and a somewhat more serious storyline (and by that, I mean a higher body count), it all feels way too familiar for it to be fully satisfying in the end.<br />This time around, we found ourselves on a casino ship called the Extravaganza of the Sea. And of course, bad things are about to happen to the people on board the ship. And just as in Big Trouble, we follow nearly half a dozen characters who are unrelated at first but who will all come together in the end.<br />I have to hand my hat to Barry because the man knows how to link half a dozen story lines together and still make sense in the end. And the man knows funny. There are many jokes within the books that made me laugh out loud, the funniest being a gag that concerns a tv news station and its unfortunate crew.<br />The Extravaganza goes to sea during a tropical storm, and all hell breaks loose. Problems keep on piling up as our characters try to struggle with crazy situation after crazy situation. And I have to admit that many of it is quite funny and entertaining at times.<br />So why wasn't I fully satisfied with the book? Well, it followed the outline set by Big Trouble much too closely. Unrelated chracters finally brought together in the end, the stupid yet likeable good guys, the even stupider bad guys, the double entendres... Tricky Business seems to be Big Trouble set on a boat. I kept waiting for something great to happen, I kept waiting for Barry to surpise me, but it never came.<br />Is the book funny? At times, yes. Is the book entertaining? More or less so. I could think of many worst ways to spend my time. The only problem is that I know Barry is capable of much better and much funnier.	2003-01-07

Then our true colors come to the surface, exposed to all like open wounds. The worst of us comes out, the best of us is buried deep within us, and the whole world surrenders to cahos. These are the things Tim Lebbon explores in the two novellas that constitute Faith in the Flesh. <br />The first novella is called The First Law. Here, we have five men who are stranded on a strange island after their ship has sunk. These military men will be faced with the worst this planet has to offer. The island is like nothing they've ever seen before, forcing them to feel and experience things that they never thought they had in them. Suspenseful and lyrical, this story is a one-of-a-kind effort that is great entertainment.<br />The second novella, From Bad Flesh, is one of Lebbon's best efforts. It's also one of the best apocalyptic novellas out there. After the world as we know it has fallen into a new Dark Age, diseases and war are slowly taking away most of the earth's population. One man, Gabe, is afflicted by one of these diseases and decides to leave on a mission to find a man who might have the power to cure him. His travels will make his see horrible things, and they will help him discover the dark truth about his world. Thought-provoking and written with skills that could challenge any classical author, From Bad Flesh is a tour de force that brings you into an introspection, that always affects you in just the right ways. You'll feel uneasy, sad, mad... Every single emotion will pass through you while reading this story. And the final climax is simply mindblowing.<br />Lebbon is one of the most important and freshest voice in dark fiction. Reading Lebbon is like nothing you've experienced before. So fasten your seat belt, hold  on tight and be ready to be amazed.	2003-01-03

Which, of course, it isn't.<br />Because the very next day, Brand is back to promise Dan that he will make his life a living hell. First, he makes Dan's wife go insane. Then, he turns on Dan's daughter, wanting a lot more out of her than a mere scare. But who - or what - is Brand? And what will it take to put a stop to the nightmare he is inflicting on them?<br />Tim Lebbon knows how to create great thrilling suspense. This supernatural Cape Fear never has a dull moment. Filled with twists and turns and compelling characters, Lebbon has created a suspenseful tour de force that will leave you breathless and on the edge of your seat.<br />Lebbon writes with the skill of Dickens, but his style of suspense and brand of supernatural horror is completely his own. Face is a great novel with many scares that proves once and for all that Lebbon is the new voice to watch in dark fiction.	2002-12-31

In the 16th Century, a young man returned to his native home town after his long disappearence. Although his looks were slightly different, people accepted this man with open arms. He took the place of the old Martin Guerre, returning to his family and to his wife. But it is only later, when the real Martin Guerre returned and after some of the men in Guerre's family had become suspicious about the new Martin Guerre, that the other man was showned to be an impostor. <br />Written with intelligence and prose that is compelling yet never too simplistic, The Return of Martin Guerre is a fantastic historical account that should please historians and history lovers alike. <br />In the first pages, Davis tells us that some of her research is more heresay than anything else, since she tried to fill in the gaps where an answer could not be found. Maybe that's why the book reads more like a story than an actual factual account.<br />Davis recreates the whole town and the ways of life of 15th century France with care and skill. Every single character that peoples the book is fully dimensional and interesting. Her presentation of these people and of the facts is always impartial, which is surprising coming from someone who states that she's also using some of her own opinions and thoughts to fill in the gaps.<br />The Return of Martin Guerre is a great read that is full of facts, but where the information is never overwhelming. This is how every historical treatise should be like.	2002-12-31

The history of genocide and murder dates back to the early days of Europe. Here, in Trent, three Jewish families were accused of murdering a young Christian boy through ritual practices. The now-infamous trial lasted more than three years, during which many Jewish men and women were tortured during brutal interrogations and forced to confess to a crime they had not committed.<br />The book is a good read that never boggles down in too much details. Hsia gives all the necessary information for the reader to understand the time and place as well as the events surrounding the death of little Simon. His study of 15th century Italy is visually appealing to the reader, as the facts are written down to be easily understood by anyone.<br />Thought-provoking, precise and well written, Trent 1475 brings you back to a time and place where torture was the popular recourse during judicial interrogations, where  the Jewish population was misunderstood and badly treated, where torture was so brutal that people would lie and condem themselves just to avoid being brutalized.<br />This book will appeal to historians, but also to the curious and inquisitive minds. Trent 1475: Stories of a Ritual Murder Trial is an important book that teaches us about our past and about our violent history.	2002-12-30

The biggest problem with Katherine Ramsland's treatise The Science of Vampires is that the author takes herself - and her subject matter - way too seriously. With this book, she tries to provide a modern explanation for vampires, all the while trying to discover whether or not vampires could really exist in today's world. That in itself isn't all that bad. It's when it comes to the validation of her arguments that the book falters into ludicracy.<br />She argues that Dracula must have been a real person because there is a lot of \\"proof\\" in the book that supports this argument? What kind of proof? Well, it is never really explained, as Ramsland loses focus and starts rambling on about all the different components of vampires. This is the question that opens the book, and that question is never answered.<br />She also tries to pin every societal ill on the vampire culture. Sadomasochism, murder, sadism, violence, skin and blood diseases... all of them end up linked to vampires. She also calls many infamous serial killers vampires. Who knew that Dahmer was a vampire! Who knew that Jack The Ripper was a vampire! Who knew that Ed Gein was a vampire! <br />Ramsland'S scope is much too wide, and she tries to incoroporate way too much here. Instead of keeping her research narrow and basing herself on literature and the so-called real-life historical vampires like Elizabeth Bathory and Vlad Tsepesh (who were both the inspiration for Stoker's Dracula, no matter what Ramsland tries to make you believe!), she keeps it so broad that she too often loses herself in the process.<br />As a pop-cultre analysis, the book does shed some light on some of the questions one could ask himself about the vampire legend. The book's best moments comes when she discusses Anne Rice's novels, or Bram Stoker and his Dracula, or the different books/movies/television shows that were either part of or influenced by the vampire culture. As a pop-culture analysis, the book does have some legitimacy. <br />If you are looking for solid facts and answers, you won't find them in this book. I can't say that I enjoyed reading The Science of Vampires, and I don't think you will either.	2002-12-26

There isn't a single thing Simmons isn't capable of writing. His novels have touched nearly every single genre - horror, dark humour, sci-fi, fantasy, action, hard-boiled crime... Simmons is able to dip his pen in every type of story that fancies him, and always excels at it. His new collection, Worlds Enough and Time, contains five science-fiction stories. But Simmons isn't able to simply write the typical sci-fi yarn. What he does is go deeper than most authors do to get a meaningful, powerful and always affecting final product.<br />The collection's best story is also its opener. Looking For Kelly Dahl is a ghost story in which a man is confronted by one of his old students. After a suicide attempt, the narrator awakens in an empty world where the only two inhabitants are himself and Kelly Dahl, a disturbed young woman who wants something out of him. What that is, however, isn't clear until the last pages of the story. Affecting, touching and often terrifying, Looking For Kelly Dahl is an amazing story that fully displays Simmons at his very best.<br />I also really enjoyed the stories The Ninth Av and On K2 with Kanakaredes. In the first story, history repeats itslef with the earth's distant Jewish descendents are faced with yet a new period of assimilation and darkness. In the second story, three men who are set on climbing to the top of K2 are forced by the government to bring an alien ambassador along for the ride. Both stories are widly original and thought-provoking.<br />Fans of Simmon's amazingly popular Hyperion series will be happy with the story Orphans of the Helix, which takes place in the Hyperion universe. Although a little slow moving, the story pushes just the right buttons. And the final climax is just perfect.<br />The only story that truly disappointed me is the closing piece, called The End Of Gravity. Well, it's not really a story, but really a film scriptment. And that's exactly how it reads: like an outline. I'm not a big fan of present-tense narratives, like this story makes the use of. And I can't say that the story itself provoked the same feelings the other four stories in this collections unearthed in me. <br />All in all, Worlds Enough and Time displays Dan Simmons at his very best. These stories, although all falling in the sci-fi  genre, should please fans of the genre but also the people who do not particularly like science fiction. Because these stories are very litteray. If you read between the lines, you'll always find more than is displayed on the page. And that is what makes an author stand above all others.	2002-12-22

What writer Thomas Cook failed to realize is that you cannot cram ten hours of material in 350 pages. The book feels over crowded and distant. The characters come and go so quickly that they all become paper-thin cutouts. What must have looked good on television looks horrible on the page.<br />It's no secret now that Taken is about alien invasions. The story starts at the very beginning, with Roswell, and ends in the present, with the last final invasion. Through this period, we meet two families. Two of these families are abductees, and the last family is the obligatory evil-military guys that are so typical and predictable that they are no fun as villains. <br />As we move through six decades, we see these families battling with the different invasions and with the fear of being 'taken'.<BR>But in a television drama, you can move fast in time like that. TV is based on dialogue, not prose. But you can't do this with a novel. If you keep moving quickly from one place to another, then the story begins feeling all over the place and quite disjointed. And Cook does nothing to try and link up these scenes with prose. Brief sentences are all that can be found between the overly abundant dialogue. <br />I did like the plot, but maybe it would have been better had each episode become a book in itself, instead of trying to cram all ten episodes in one book and use only the dialogue, linking them with brief sentences like 'and then they were in the kitchen' or 'and then he was in the houspital'. As a matter of fact, the words 'and then' or 'and so' appear so often that, by the end, you just can't stand it anymore.<br />Thomas H. Cook is a well-liked mystery author. He should probably stick with his own original material. Taken is a very incompetant attempt at adapting a very good series, one that leaves you completely dissatisfied and boring.	2002-12-18

Well, the results is Four Dark Nights, an anthology that takes four of the best names in today's horror field to display their widly twisted imaginations.<br />The first fourth is a nasty little story called The Circle by Bentley Little. The story plays with time, and with your mind, in amazing ways. You will find a whole neighbourhood blasted into a complete nightmare when a spell is cast of them all. You can't ever predict what's going to happen. The story is also darkly funny. This is the best thing Little has written in a while.<br />The next two stories, unfortunately, do not display the best of their authors. Christopher Golden's Pyre has its heart in the right place, but its slow-pace and its very predictable payoff take too much away from the story. Here,you find a young woman who wants to resurrect her father to make things right with him again. Tom Piccirilli's Jonah Arose might be too dark original for its own good. The story is a little too depressing and a little to anti-climactic. A pack of dead (or are they?) freak-show attractions are trying to find the narrator's son and rescue him from his demented kidnapper in a world that is eerily similar to ours, but also fundamentally different. Piccirilli's style takes too long to get accustomed to, and the story takes too much time to unfold for you to really fully enjoy yourself.<br />The heart of this book is written by today's most powerful, most imaginative and most entertaining horror writer. Douglas Clegg has a unique voice that is both strong and magical. And his story The Words does not disappoint. You can always count on Clegg to deliver the goods and he does so again this time around, and then some. In this story, a group of teenage highschoolers find themselves stranded in an abandoned church where an evil force has been resurrected. Clegg has an amazing ability tocreate characters you care for and want to know more about. The story is scary, fast-paced and very affecting. Douglas Clegg is bound to become one of the most important voice in today's horror field.<br />These four novellas will provide a great deal of entertainment. Maybe it wasn't fair to pit Golden and Piccirilli against masters like Little and Clegg. But in any case, the book is more than worth its price for its opening and closing stories. The two tales in between are just icing on an already very colorful cake.	2002-12-14

I'm more than glad to say that his first novel wasn't a one-time hit. Because with Dark Hollow, Connolly raises the stakes even higher, brings even more suspense to the page and establishes himself as one of the strongest voice in modern suspense ficiton.<br />It's hard to be &quot;Bird&quot; Parker. First, nearly one year ago, he lost his wife and daughter to the sadistic Traveling Man. Now, after a move to Northern Maine, Parker finds himself thrown in the middle of yet another investigation, one that will leave a sky-high number of dead bodies and that will induce a lot of pain for all involved.<br />The case starts when a young woman and her infant child are murdered. The prime suspect is her ex-husband. But Parker thinks different. He knows that the mob is somehow invloved in this. And he can't understand how a sadistic killer called Caleb Kyle - one Bird's grandfather tried to catch five or six decades ago and who's name has now become a legend in Dark Hollow - fits into all of this. But it's only when the daughter of an old friend of Parker's disappears in the Maine countryside that Bird can start putting the pieces of the puzzle back together. Only, time is more than an issue and Parker has very little of it.<br />Connolly is a master at mending two/three storylines together into a coherent whole. What seems to be two separate cases in the beginning become entagled in surprising ways, and the outcome is never predictable. His characters never take the easy way out, nor are they blown out of proportion. Most of them are anti-heroes, people who fall into the role reluctantly, unwillingly. Parker's just a regular guy who keeps finding himself put in awkward situations.<br />Reading DArk Hollow is like being on a roller-coaster ride. Every time you think the suspense can't go any higher, every time you think the stakes can't possiblygo higher, every time you think the suspense will finally let up, you're thrown in another loop. This book would make an amazing film!<br /> And with this book, Connolly creates an amazing villain, one of mythical proportions. And the way all the different people involved in the story (the mob, cops, assassins) and the way Bird's personal life is portrayed on the page makes this book one of the best suspense novel I've read in a long time.<br />Simply put, Dark Hollow is a masterwork of suspense that you won't soon forget. One of the best novels of the year!	2002-12-09

Well, the results is quite depressing and unsatisfactory. Baldacci, who is usually able to create great deals of suspense in his stories, fumbles around with fake characters that you can never care for and a story that is, to say the truth, overstuffed.<br />Tom is a man who's life feels quite empty. His job as a journalist isn't as fulfilling as it once was and his romantic life is nearly nonexistant. Because you see, Tom was once in love. But because of stupid mistakes, the love of his life, Eleanor, walked out on him, and he was never able to forget himself for you.<br />But wattaya know! When Tom takes a train a few days before Christmas, he finds that Eleanor is on the very same train. Will he be able to patch things up with her in time for Christmas? I don't think the answer to this question would surprise anyone.<br />The main story in itself isn't bad, but Baldacci stuffed this small book with nearly a dozen other bland characters and many different plot lines that never amount to anything. Do we really need a subplot about a petty thief? Do we really need a subplot about a hollywood director? Do we really need a subplot about a young couple who will do anything to get married? As subplot after subplot clutters the story, the book ends up feeling as stuffed as an overflowing Christmas stocking. And did Baldacci need to make his Tom the saviour figure that he becomes? He enters the lives of these minor characters and changes them, always for the best. After a while, you can't help but wish that Tom would open his eyes and work some of that magic on his own self. Baldacci does not spend much time on any of these smaller characters, which makes each and every one of them feel flat and very, very, very unreal.<br />What should have been an intimate Christmas romance ends up being a mess of characters and plot. Baldacci, who'sa very competent author, stumbles left and right in this one. Although you can see that his heart is in the right place, you can't help but wish that he would have spent a little more time on the main plot and less time on the many unnecessary details.	2002-12-01

Like the very best of Dickens, this is a novel of exquisite richness plot-wize, character-wize and emotion-wize. Every word and every sentence resonates with fervent power and force in such a way that, by the end, you realize that the whole story has been embedded in your mind with a stunning power.<br />When William Rackhman meets a young prostitute named Sugar, he never thought that she would forever change his life, for better and for worse. William is a lonely and desperate man. His wife is growing madder with each passing day, his father does not trust him enough to give him the reins of the family business, his brother is a priest with whom he has become estranged, and he barely knows his young daughter.<br />So when Sugar enters his life, William embraces with wide-open arms. But is she really the angelic figure he thinks her to be, or is Sugar also plagued with mystery and terrible secrets? At first, he is so infatuated with her that he buys her a house to keep her safe from other men. But then, his infatuation grows into something deeper, to the point where he will enventually invite Sugar in his own home and keep her as his daughter's governess.<br />Plague with a great deal of emotions, sadness and realism, The Crimson Petal and the White is a novel that is both realistic and partly fantastic. Do not let the novel's length fool you; there is never a dull moment in this story.<br />And I like the fact that every single character is more human than fictional. I particularly liked Sugar, who is both the image of goodness and the tortured soul that craves recognition. Her influence on William will be both good and bad. With every new page, you can easily sense how sad and lonely Sugar is. She craves for the life her own mother, who turned her into a prostitute, could never offer her. A character like this one rarely appears in today's fiction. It would have been easy for Faber to turn her into this greater-than-life charcter drenched in pure goodness. Instead, he offers us a flawed character who's is more a dreamer than an achiever.<br />Faber's voice is powerful and effective. With this book, he created a masterpiece that digs much deeper than the average work of fiction. The Crimson Petal and the White is the type of novel that will live for a long time, an instant classic that you won't soon forget.	2002-11-29

In her book Portrait of a Killer, crime fiction novelist Patricia Cornwell claims that she has uncovered the true identity of Jack The Ripper, the madman who haunted the lives of everyone in London in the late 1800. But who was the real Ripper? His identity was never found. Only conspiracies and theories exist. Cornwell, through years of research, scientific analysis and very intelligent deductions, might have stumble upon something that is very close to the so-called truth.<br />Walter Sickert, a somewhat renown painter of the time who died in the 1940s, is the man Cornwell accuses of being Jack the Ripper. Sickert has been one of the many men named during the course of history, and now Cornwell has tried to prove his guilt. <br />Many of Sickert's painting bear frightening resemblances to the crime scenes and the victims themselves. The letter sent to the police and newspapers echo the things Sickert was living at the time. And Cornwell, through unduly research, can even place him at the scenes of the crime most of the time. Sickert's background is the kind that would undoubtedly help at creating a killer. <br />What I liked about the book is that Cornwell's argument isn't one-sided. When some of her research failed, she is not afraid to say so. For example, DNA testing on a letter Sickert sent compared to that of a letter the Ripper sent were inconclusive. But many other tests Cornwell did offer some new light on the subject at hand. <br />Was Walter Sickert Jack the Ripper? I'm not sure the book fully proves that. But it makes a very strong argument for it. The Ripper story is filled with falsities and fiction. Cornwell does erase all of it to give us the bare truth and the real facts. She goes back to each and every murder scene and analyzes them. She tries to go into Sickert's mind and show us his many mood swings, his dark personality and his abnormal behaviour.<br />All in all, Cornwell does make her point, and quite strongly. The book is very informative and written in a very entertaining way. After a series of fiction duds, Cornwell is back full-force with this non-fiction effort.	2002-11-19

Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles have been less than stellar as of late. It seems that her novels lacked the most crucial thing of all: plot. Merrick aside, most of her books have been long-winded and very repetitive. So it's great to finally see her back on top again. With Blackwood Farm, not only does Anne introduces a new character, but she also brings forth one of her most entertaining and fast-paced efforts ever. <br />Blackwood Farm is much more than a vampire novel. As a matter of fact, the vampire component seems to be secondary. Instead, what we do have is a great ghost story and a great haunted house story. Tarquin is a young man in his late teens who has seen ghosts all of his life. His best friend is a ghost he calls Goblin. Goblin looks exactly like Tarquin and also acts like him. But many around Tarquin thinks he is crazy for seeing all these ghosts.<br />Tarquin is made into a vampire, something that does not sit well with Goblin. Goblin also wants the same eternal power, and so he begins attacking Tarquin every time he makes a kill so that he, too, can have some of the eternal blood and become stronger. Tarquin wants to rid himself of Goblin. He goes to none other than Lestat for help. And it is to Lestat that Tarquin will tell his amazing story.<br />This time around, Anne Rice found a way to instate a new life in her series. This story isn't repetitive at all. The biggest problem with books like Blood and Gold were that we already knew so much about these vampires that their stories no longer felt fresh. But here, we have something that is completely new and different.<br />I have to admit that I loved the book's central character. Tarquin is a one-of-a-kind that stays embedded in your mind for quite some time. And I have to admit that I preferred the ghost story parts over the vampire parts (maybe Anne could write a full-fledge ghost story next time around). <br />The book's strongest point is the way in which Anne brings the whole Blackwood clan tolife. They live in an old New Orleans mansion that holds too many secrets, and too many residents. The way in which all of these characters are fleshed out was just perfect. The place where Rice falters is in the romance department. Her idea of romance is a little too flowery and blissful for my taste, and Tarquin falls way too easily in and out of love (like most of Anne Rice's characters). <br />Blackwood Farm is Rice's best work since Memnoch The Devil. It is a fast-paced, exhilarating read that very rare falters. Anne Rice fans will be glad to see that the queen of vamps is finally back on top!	2002-11-17
US	49059365	R1VKU77DWI7RDV	0316153915	77432495	Chasing the Dime	Books	5	0	3	N	N	Thrill Ride of the Year	Michael Connelly has without a doubt become the prime writer of suspense. He is the master of white-knuckle and nail-biting ficiton. Here, with Chasing The Dime, Connelly tries something completely new and different. He presents us with a new type of character that is not a ex-cop or a detective or an investigator. As a matter of fact, this guy has nothing to do with the law. What we have here is a regular guy who soons finds himself trapped in a nightmare of his own doing, a nightmare where time itself will become his worst enemy.<br />Pierce is a biochemist who is on track of making one of the greatest discoveries of all time. After a hard breakup, he moves into a new appartment. The moment his new telephone number is connected, Pierce starts receiving messages for a woman called Lily. Lily isn't your average woman. She seems to be working for an escort service. And she also seems to have disappeared without a trace.<br />Because of something from his past that is still haunting him, Pierce starts investigating the missing woman. And soon enough, he becomes part of something greater than him, the average guy faced with the worst possible evil. In no time, it seems that everyone is after him. Friends, co-workers, strangers and even the police are trying to get Pierce. Pierce isn't safe anywhere since everyone is a suspect.  <br />Connelly wrote a great suspense novel with an average Joe at its center. And the suspense levels displayed here are amazing. It's like a great roller-coster ride. Every time you think the suspense will let up, the plot enters a new loop and gains momentum, never letting up until the very last page.<br />Connelly already was a great writer of supsense. But with Chasing the Dime, he proves that he can write something slightly different, slightly off-center. He proves that he does not need a cop or a detective to create a great noir thriller. And Connelly also proves once and for all that he is THE master of great endings. You can never guesswho the guitly party is until Connelly actually divulges the answers, and Chasing the Dime is no exception to the rule.<br />Michael Connelly fans will be greatly pleased with this effort. And people who have never read anything by the author will discover what the best supspense novelist of our time is really capable of.	2002-11-07
US	49059365	R3403ZS8DKCFAP	0345433319	541544893	Midnight Voices	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A Good Yarn but...	Midnight Voices is a slightly above average Saul novel. It's Rosemary's Baby meets Jackson's Hauting of Hill House. There's a lot that's good in here, and yet, I still wasn't fully satisfied with it as a whole. Maybe it was the paper-thin characters, or Saul's tendency to over describe emotions, but something prevented me from fully giving way to the story.<br />And that's a shame, because the plot itself was quite good. After her husband was brutally murdered, Caroline thinks that it's the end for her. She's swamped with bills, with work problems, with personal problems and, to top it off, with two children who do not understand what she is going through. But all of that is about to change when she meets Tony, a rich man who lives in one of the town's most enigmatic, most exclusive apartment building: The Rockwell.<br />Things, however, soon become stranger than ficiton. It seems that something's wrong with The Rockwell and its inhabitants. The too-good-to-be-true way of life is exactly that. Ryan and Laurie, Caroline's children, quickly realize that someone - or something - might be after them. But when Caroline finally begins to believe her children's accusations, it's already too late.<br />I did enjoy most of the Rockwell's residents. They were colorful characters that actually felt unique and distinct from one another. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the main characters. It almost felt as if Caroline and her children were the ones dragging the story. I wanted to know more about the Rockwell, I wanted to know more about the horrible things those people have committed. Instead, Saul went the conventional way, using the damsel-and-children and distress storyline that is prominant in so many of his novels. Ryan aside, the main characters (Tony, Caroline and Laurie) felt like nothing more than stock characters, the kind of people that too often populate Saul's novels. <br />At least the levels of suspense are sustained through most of the book. Although the story has a few brief moments where the plots does lag a little, I liked the way in which Saul kept building the suspense, always pushing things to the next level. And the storyline itself was quite intriguing. It reminded me of those old horror films that relied more on suspense and thrills than blood and  gore. And this is exactly what Saul does with Midnight Voices.<br />Although not a great book, Midnight Voices did offer some good entertaining moments. It's nice to see that Saul is trying to break away from the stories that made him so predicatble in the past. Maybe next time, he'll actually get to write the great suspense novel that is trapped somehwere in him.	2002-11-02
US	49059365	R371SRJGNI8TX0	0786015004	31468867	The Fixer	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Vamp Noir	Take the underworld of the 40s film noir and mix it with the comic book Blade, and the result will be something that closely resembles Jon F. Merz's The Fixer. This books marks the promising start of a new series which will appeal to anyone who is tired of the goth-chique vampires of Anne Rice.<br />The novel is fast-paced and very atmospheric. You are thrown into the noir world which you saw so often in the 40s crime films. Lawson reminded me a little of the Bogarts of that era, only with more muscles and with a badder, more sarcastic attitude.<br />Although the books lags a little in its central part (Merz gives us too much background info on Lawson; he could have stretched it out over the next few books), the rest of a the book is great fun. The wry, sarcastic humour and the often funny situations elevates this book over the B-style novel it could easily have become.<br />The Fixer isn't mind blowing, but it is a great read that will keep you entertained until its very last page.	2002-10-27
US	49059365	RZJTGUZCLFT1Z	0316154059	817062475	City of Bones	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The Great One Returns	It didn't take all that long for Michael Connelly to become one of today's top mystery authors. And it's not hard to see why. His books are always suspenseful, filled with great dialogue and believable characters. His stories are intriguing and always intricate. And, most of the time, his plots are unpredictable.<br />Although City Of Bones isn't Connelly's best, it still shows how amazing the author truly is. Here, we find Bosch, one of the characters Connelly established in his earlier works. He is now working as a detective in Hollywood. On New Year's eve, he is told to investigate bones that have been uncovered by a dog. On closer examination, the bones are shown to be human and belonging to a twelve year old boy who would have died over twenty years ago. <br />The quest to find the boy's identity and his killer follows. And what a chase it is! The story is full of subplots that will keep you guessing until the very last page.<br />I love Connelly's style. His books are gritty and straight to the point. He is the noir author par excellence. As Bosch investigates the crime and uncovers many of the answers that have been laying dormant for over twenty years, he will meet many great characters, such as a young female officer in whom he will find romance, or the victim's sister and father, who's past is filled with dark secrets that are just waiting to resurface. All of Connelly's characters have ghosts in their closets, which only adds to the dark tones of his stories. <br />All in all, City Of Bones is yet another great work of fiction by today's best mysetery author. When you start one of Connelly's books, you won't want to let go of it until the it's done. City of Bones is no exception.	2002-10-22

Michael Faber takes the greatest ills of today's society and places them on a new species which has been living hidden from humans for many years. This species is as evolved as humans are, with one main difference: instead of breeding animals like cows and pigs, they breed human beings for consumption.<br />One of these creture is Isserly, who's exterior appearence has been altered to resemble that of a human. She now walks amongst us, picking up male hitch-hickers with well-formed bodies. And, if they have no family, she drugs them and brings them back to headquarters where they are harvested. <br />But Isserly's life isn't as peachy as she pretends it to be. As a matter of fact, she is alone, an outcast in both our world and her own. It is only when a rich young man named Amliss comes to the headquarters that Isserly will come to realize how empty and unfulfilled her life truly is.<br />Under The Skin tangles many issues from today's society in a fantasy and horror setting that never ceases to impress. I loved the way the story is constructed; instead of giving you everything you need to know upfront, Faber gives you only bits and pieces about Isserly's world throughout the novel, so that you never get a full picture of her world until the very end. And in the end, the parallels between Isserly's world and our own becomes terrifyingly blurred. <br />Rich in ideas and brilliant in its execution, Under The Skin will do what A Brave New World did so many years ago. IT is a novel that refuse to belong to one single genre, a novel that blends ideas and fiction with suprising ease and power. This is a visionistic story that will leave you completely breathless, and disoriented all at once.	2002-10-18

Brite, the two masters of short horror fiction, join forces to bring us this one-of-a-kind collection that surpasses all levels of expectations. Short stories aren't as loved as they once used to be. These two authors (who have also written great novels of gothic horror) make us open our eyes and wonder why the short stories have become a lost art form. They are able, in a very few words, to make their readers care for the characters and for the things they feel and do, something that many authors aren't even able to do in a full-length novel. <br />The collection opens with Brite's The Crystal Empire, about a man who falls in love with a musician and who's only way out is to murder the signer. The story is dark and atmospheric, everything you'd expect to find in a Poppy Brite story.<br />Kiernan's Onion is the best short story I've read in a long time. Here, we have a couple who saw things in their young age, other worlds, places that were never meant to be seen by the naked eye. Salvation time has come for this troubled couple. Verging the lines of dark fantasy, Onion is a very unique story that masterfully blends emotions, terror and drama. It makes you stand on the very edge of sanity. <br />And then we have the collaborative work, a story called The Rest Of The Wrong Things. This story takes the best of both authors and puts it to full use. Three people are brought to an old factory where (what else) dark things abide. And one of them holds the key to their awakening. <br />I loved every moment I spent reading Wrong Things. This anthology proves once and for all that Kiernan and Brite have perfectly mastered the art of short fiction. If you are a fan of either authors, or if you enjoy dark fiction, then do not let this one pass you by!	2002-10-07

The concept is highly original and intelligent and yet, in the end, you never really care for any of it. This is one of those books that has a great concept but, because of its poor execution, you can't ever fully enjoy the ride.<br />Carl wakes up one morning to find his wife and six-month old daughter dead in their beds. They died in their sleep for no apparent reason. Now, twenty years later, Carl is a journalist. He comes upon a case where babies all over the country are dying of 'crib deaths', which means that their deaths cannot be explained. He traces these deaths back to a lullaby of African origin that has the power to kill people. Now that Carl has this power in his hands, he soons becomes a killing machine, whether he wants it or not.<br />And of course, like in all of Palahniuk's novels, Carl meets a woman who looks normal and sane on the outside but who is everything but. Helen has also lost her family because of the culling song. They embark on a journey to destroy all of the existing copies of the song so that innocent people will stop dying. But they also want to destory the song so that they'll be the only ones to hold the power over life and death.<br />There is a very unnecessary withcraft subplot, but that aside, Lullaby is a great story that should have fully entertained me. Instead, I often found myself bored with it. Palahniuk needs to stop trying to be so self-analytical and sarcastic all the time. His style is getting a little old. I like the way he can look at the real world and ridicule it, but sometimes, less is more. And in this case, I would have taken less of that world analysis and more of the plot.<br />Palahnuik is supposedly the voice of today's generation. And I can see why. His writing is witty and post-modern and often darkly funny. But without any characters you can ever really care for, and without enough plot to sustain a whole novel, Lullaby is a failed attempt at greatness.	2002-10-05

Douglas Clegg has established himself as one of the strongest and most original voice of modern horror fiction. His books aren't about how much blood can be shed on each page, or how many characters can be killed in the story. His stories are about real people faced with greater-than-life situations, situations that often tangle with the paranormal. <br />The Hour Before Dark is undoubtedly one of Clegg's best. The book quietly written (it isn't about shock value) and brilliantly executed. He slowly but constantly builds up the suspense until, in the end, you realize that it has reached sky-high levels.<br />The story concentrates on Nemo, a man who returns to his family house (situated on an island) where his father has been murdered. There, he finds his sister Brooke, a strange and sligthly disturbed young woman, and his brother Bruno, a no-nonsense kind of guy. As they are brought together to face their past (and also the present), their family house becomes alive with energy. And the only way for them to face this evil will be to play what they call 'the dark game', a game their father thought them, a game that must be played in the hours before dark, a game that can be dangerous and deadly. The very game that made all of this begin in the first place.<br />This novel has many great and creepy moments that you will not soon forget. It is a tour-de-force of horror suspense that will leave your breathless. The pacing is amazing, as the suspense builds constantly, never stopping, until the very end (and even in its final pages, the suspense rises again). And the ending itself is simply perfect. <br />The Hour Before Dark will be this year's best horror novel. Read it before everyone else does!	2002-10-01

He actually tangled the possessed-car storyline with Christine and so people think he has begun repeating himself. Those people have not read From A Buick 8, because it is a truly original work that displays some of King's best writing, and more!<br />Ned Wilcox has grown up without a father. You see, his father was a trooper who got killed while on the job. Ned is now 18 and kind of lost in his life. So he gets a job at the very same station his father worked at before his death. It is here that Ned will discover what Troop D has kept hidden in Shed B since the late seventies; an old buick that is everything but. <br />As Ned listens to Sandy (the chief) tell the story of the old Buick (with the help of a few other troopers), he will soon learn that appearences are, more often than not, highly misleading. But most importantly, he will finally be able to learn about his father and about the things he did before his death. Ned will finally be able to start the grieving process now that he knows who his father really was. <br />The car itself isn't haunted or possessed. It is just... weird. It looks real but isn't. It keeps silent most of the time, but then sometimes wakes up to cause havoc. It makes things disappear and makes monstrous things appear. <br />The book is so well written that it practically reads itself. Written in the first person, reading this book is like listening to someone tell a great tale while sitting around a campfire on warm summer night. From the very first page, you get lost into the story. First thing you'll know, you'll be reading the very last page, something you'll do with regret because this is one story you won't want to see end. <br />The book is often funny, touching, very scary and extremely suspenseful. This is Stephen King at his best. Take Bag of Bones, mix it with a little bit of IT and a little of The Dark Tower books and what you'll get is something resembling From a Buick 8. It's a shame that King is thinking of retiring when he is writing the best stuff of his career!	2002-09-27

His books aren't about monsters with claws and fangs, or ghosts or aliens. No, his books touch upon the most terrifying kind of horror; realistic violence and the darkness that often lives deep within us.  <br />Red is no exception. When Ludlow goes fishing with his old mutt Red, the last thing he imagined was that this would soon become the most horrible day of his life. While he is fishing, Ludlow encounters three teenage boys. Their only intent is to cause havoc on everyone and everything that comes in their way. The boys murder Ludlow's dog when they find out that Ludlow does not have any money to give them.<br />Ludlow goes to the boys's families in their hopes that their parents will punish the boys, but they won't do anything about it. He tries going to the law, but they tell him that there's nothing they can do about it either since there were no witnesses. All Ludlow wants is an apology, to see that these boys are sorry about what they've done. Unfortunately for him, his quest turns into a complete nightmare, one that will end with blood, violence and a death.<br />This quiet horror novel is one of the most powerful read I've had the pleasure of setting my eyes upon in a very long time. This novel digs deep into the old man's soul as we, too, join him in his quest. Ludlow doesn't really want revenge, though he will be thrown right into this bloody mess that will get completely out of hands. <br />This is one of Ketchum's best effort and I am more than happy to finally see it in print in America. This book also includes a short novella, The Passenger, which is a little more graphic and fast-paced than Red, but that is nonetheless very entertaining. This is Ketchum at his very best. Don't let this one pass you by!	2002-09-23

Three of these stories are worth being praised, while the fourth might have been better had it been in a different collection.<br />The title story is probably the best of the whole book (and, also comes last, save the best for last right?). Here, we have a teacher who is faced with his greatest challenge, one that will span over many decades, one that will leave him changed forever. This story is touching and very affecting, about one man's struggle with morality. A real gem. My second favorite story was Batorsag & Szerelem, a moving story about one boy and his struggles brought upon being the youngest of the family. He is ceaselessly compared to his older brother, who is more intelligent and popular than he is. Living up to his big brother's reputation is one thing he will learn to try and passby in order to be happy with himself.<br />The story City of Broken Hearts is a very moving story about one man's realization of his life's emptiness. William is divorced and misses his son, who lives in another city. When his son comes back for a visit, he tries to come to peace with the past. But it is only when his son sets him up on a blind date that William will realize that he needs to fill the emptiness that is slowly eating him up. <br />After these great stories, it's kind of a downer to think back on the book's first story, entitled Accountant. Although the story is quite original and entertaining, it lacked the power and writing skills the author displayed so perfectly with the following three stories. Another story about a family man who has never been really happy with himself, this story is also one that deals with self realization and self depreciation. An enjoyable read, if only that.<br />Canin displays a great range of human emotions in this short collection. His writing is very affecting and powerful. His choice of words is always delibarate and purposeful. Every sentence has a meaning and leads somewhere, unlike other stories in collections by lesser authors, where half of it is composed of emptiness and the other half of a very weak plot and paper-thin characters. You will find none of that in this book. The Palace Thief is a highly engaging collection by one of the best new voice in dramatic fiction.	2002-09-20

But you can be sure that each new book will be suspenseful and thrilling. After all, Harris IS the guy who invented Hannibal Lecter, the most notorious killer ever printed on the page. Unfortunately, for those who want another Lecter-filled novel (like Silence of the Lambs and its slightly inferior sequel, Hannibal) will be greatly disappointed. In fact, although this book marks Lecter's first appearence ever, he is a very minor character in this book, seen only in maybe twenty or so pages. <br />Instead, this story is about the title character, the Red Dragon, aka the Tooth Fairy, a killer who preys on whole families and kills them in their sleep. Even more frightening, he films their murders and keeps the tapes as mementos. It is now up to FBI agent Will Graham to catch this killer before he strikes next.<br />Graham, like all great suspense novel protagonist, is haunted by his past. He was the man who captured Lecter, but he is still haunted by the traumatic events of that day. Now, he will have to turn to Lecter himself to get help in sovling the crimes, as the Tooth Fairy will turn to the infamous murderer and become a pen pal of sorts with him.<br />The most amazing thing about this novel is that it is the antogonist himself, the Tooth Fairy, who takes center stage. Harris created a killer who is both repulsive and intriguing, a killer whom you hate even if you can't stop yourself from caring about him. Harris brings us right into the madman's past to show us how the mind of the serial killer is given birth to. And this little bit of time traveling is one of the most disturbing and emotionally frightening things I have ever read. <br />Harris is without a doubt the master of nail-biting suspense. His tales move fast, his dialogue is witty and his characters are highly believable. Although this book doesn't achieve the greatness that Harris found with Silence of the Lambs,it is still a great entry in the Lecter legacy, and a great stand-alone suspense novel.	2002-09-14

Novels, horror, sci-fi, fantasy, plays, scripts, comics... He has done it all. Well, almost all. The only thing missing in his repertoire is a children's novel. But here comes Coraline, a very touching and very entertaining story that will touch young and old alike.<br />Coraline is a very lonely girl. She has moved in this big house and has nothing to do. On one rainy day, she goes exploring and finds a door in a closet. This door leads to another world, where people looking almost exactly like the ones from the real world, where the places look almost like the ones she used to seein the real world. Only these new 'other' people and places are slightly different, darker.<br />When Coraline's parents are kidnapped by her 'other' mother, it will be up to her to save them and to defeat this evil woman who is pretending to be her mother. She goes on a wild goose chase in order to find the things that will help her defeat this evil woman.<br />Gaiman is a master at creating different and weird places that still feel real for the reader. And he does it perfectly in Coraline. This magical little tale can be dark at times, but Coraline is such an amazing character placed in such an odd and interesting setting that you'll never find a dull moment in this book. <br />I don't think there is a single thing Gaiman does not excell in. His writing is just magical. It grips you by the guts and makes you smile, makes you frown, makes you feel a slew of emotions all at once. With Coraline, he has created a story - and, most importantly, a heroine - that everyone will love and remember for a very long time.	2002-09-09

He doesn't like selling drugs, he just does it because he's good at it. What he wants out of life is recognition and praise. He wants to be good at something - anything - just to feel better about himself. <br />White Mike enters and walks out of the life of many teens, all of them rich, all of them clueless about what it means to live. These kids have everything they desire, so much so that they are actually bored with their own little existence. <br />The title refers to a drug. Twelve is a new drug that gives its user a new kind of thrill. But these kids don't need drugs to live on another planet. They already do live in their own little world. They lack guidance, they lack parenting, they lack good influences. They lack everything except money. And this emptiness they felt throughout the whole book. <br />Nick McDonell has written a great novel about our times. It is not trying to make us feel bad about these rich kids. It is actually trying to show us how troubled and empty these kids really are. Written in short chapters and very brief and uneloquent prose (many whats, ifs, and likes are used to add colour to the prose), the novel captures today's youth to perfection, which is not an easy feat to achieve. McDonell is the new voice for today's generation.	2002-09-09

Critics praised it for its intense suspense and great characters. They must have read a different book than the one I did, because I found very little of either in this book. In the end, the novel is a very disappointing read that I will easily forgot. <br />New York, late 1800s. A serial killer is murdering your male prostitutes. And since the crimes aren't affecting the upper class, they have been ignored for a long time. Theodore Roosevelt, then the President of the New York Police, hands the case to a New York Times reporter and an alienist, both of whom he has know since his early college years. The men, with the help of a young woman who dreams of becoming a police officer and a few more men working underneath them, go about trying to solve the case that no one else has been able to solve by using new techniques in  psychology and science.<br />The book moves very slowly. Instead of giving intense scenes of suspense, what Carr gives us is scene after scene of our main characters analyzing and reanalyzing the madman's murders, trying to recreated the ways in which this man's mind works. True, there are a few chilling scenes. The murders themselves are quite gruesome. But I think that the horror level is downplayed because the murderer himself takes a secondary place in the novel. Carr isn't really interested in this man. He is more interested in giving his readers a historical account of the birth of forensic science, which could have been quite interesting had the author rememebered that he was in fact writing fiction.<br />The book is well-researched and it does bring you right into the New York of the late 1800s. But that alone isn't enough to sustain the reader's attention for 600 pages. By the end, with its by-the-book and quite bland finale, the story didn't do anything for me. Maybe I didn't like the author's style (way too many scenes of psychological analysis, not enough actual detectivework), or maybe the book was so hyped that I was expecting too much from it. Either way, The Alienist is far from being the great achievement in mystery writing some have made it to be.	2002-09-05

And suspenseful it is! This is the kind of book that grabs you from the very first page to take you on a roller coaster ride that never seems to end. This is like reading a good B-movie; it's completely unbelievable, full of twists and turns and surprises and very very fast-paced. <br />When Jane receives a note coming from a man who calls himself MOG (short for Master Of Games), she decides to follow the stranger's instructions just to see where it'll take her. And when it brings her to an envelope full of cash, she doesn't shy from obeing his next command. And with each new command, comes a new envelope filled with even more cash.<br />But with each new envelope, the stakes get higher and higher. How far will Jane go for money? And who exactly is that young professor who keeps popping up at the strangest of times?<br />Laymon's writing isn't brilliant. His style is simple; short sentences, lots of dialogue and internal dialogue. And yet, this style helps to elevate the novel to a whole new level of suspense. It's also very interesting to see how Jane changes through the book; she starts out as a fragile, shy woman and ends up confident and even full of herself. <br />I loved this book. It was so much fun! It takes you on a wild ride that you will not soon forget. Laymon does live up to his reputation once again. This is the master of suspense at his thrilling best.	2002-08-22

They all started feeling the same after a while. Too many authors have tried to imitate the classics, like King's The Stand, McCammon's Swan Song or the undervalued Earth Abides. But here comes Nature of Balance, an original, terrifying and brilliantly written novel that delivers everything a good horror novel should, and more.<br />When the greater part of the earth's population dies in one single night (dying through their dreams), the small group of survivors have to try and find a way to live in this changing new world. Not only has everyone died, but the nature and the animals themsevles are evolving into something more terrifying. And who exactly is that mysterious woman that keeps showing her face whenever trouble occurs?<br />You have a group of very distinct and very original characters, something that is quite rare in this genre. You have Blane, an elderly man who has always loved nature, the father figure of sorts. You have Peer, a young woman who might just have a greater part to play in all of this than she first thought possible. You have Holly and Paul, two strangers who will find something comfort in each other's presence. And you have Mary, a wild girl who has finally found her purpose in a world that has always turned its back on her. <br />When all these characters meet and mingle, bad things abound. The novel itself is a wild ride that never seems to stop. There is a slight part in the middle of the book that feels a little long, but besides this, the rest is a greatly written novel that never disappoints. And the finale is imaginative and completely unpredictable. Many things a revealed in the end and every piece of the puzzle falls in place. <br />The Nature of Balance is a novel by Tim Lebbon, who's writing is skilled and very confident. This is one author to watch for. There are great things awaiting him in the future!	2002-08-17

True, the story is about murder and death, but the novel itself is so uplifting that you end up feeling rejuvenated once you finish reading it. It is the kind of novel that you want to take your time reading because you just do not want it to end. Quite simply put, The Lovely Bones is a pure gem, a rare literary work that will appeal to all readers. <br />Susie is a young teenage girl who thinks she has a bright future in front of her. Unfortunately, her life is cut short when she is brutally murdered by one of her neighbours. Death comes to take her away and she finds herself in heaven. From there, she looks down on her family and loved ones and witnesses how much her death affects their lives.<br />She looks down on her parents, who's relationship deteriorates after her murder. She looks down on her younger sister and brother, who both misses her in their own ways, but who both also have to compete with her death for attention. She looks down on her grandmother, a woman who wasn't all that much loved but who will find a new life for herself after the tragic incident. And she looks down on two friends from school, who will be forever changed by her death. And she also looks down on Harvey, the very man who murdered her and who may very well do it again. <br />As she sees these people grow and age, Susie narrates the story with a nostalgic grace that is always touching, never annoying. The story she narrates spans for over twenty years, a period during which many things will happen to these peoples' lives. <br />Alice Sebold created a story that is always touching, always emotionally striking and very entertaining. It is not a murder mystery. Nor is it a highly literary exploration on death. The story feels real, the characters feel real and Susie is one of the most interesting and memorable narrator ever put on the page. <br />The characters in this novel are in constant flux, always changing and evolving. So is the reader. This is the kind of book that changes you, that makes you feel better about yourself. It is the kind of book that will stay with you for a very long time. It is an unforgettable read, one of those rare novels that comes only once in a lifetime.	2002-08-10

First, in Hard Case, he was released from prison to find his life not only forever changed but in danger. Looks like things haven't changed much since we last saw him. Only this time around, the stakes are much higher and the finale much more satisfying.<br />Everyone wants a piece of Joe Kurtz. First, there is the Italian mob family that served such an important purpose in the first novel. Then, there is also a man pretending to be a cop who will do everything in his power to protect his false identity. When Kurtz is hired by a man to investigate a crime that has been commited a long time ago, he will have to ally himself with some of his enemies in order to get rid of his other foes. The stakes go higher and higher, to end up in one big great finale that you will not soon forget. <br />Always tense, always action-packed and incredibly witty, Hard Freeze is a great read that takes you back to the very best years of Raymond Chandler and Elmore Leonard. This is crime noir at its best. What's even more surprising is that this installment in Simmons's new noir series is actually better than its predecessor.<br />I had a blast reading this book. It is often funny, very dark and brilliantly plotted. Hard Freeze is exactly what all crime fiction should be; fun, entertaining and gripping.	2002-08-03

Her stories are always very affecting and touching, emotionally powerful and gothic in style. Her writing is always beautiful and shocking, poetic and dark. And even though her latest effort, In The Garden of Poisonous Flowers, isn't her best work, it is still a very enjoyable read.<br />The story (more a novella, really) introduces us to a slew of strange and very original characters that will all come together in one grand finaly. You have the albino teen, Dancy, who is kidnapped by a trio of vampires, led by The Bailif and also compromised of a boy and of Dead Girl. Then you have a group of strange women who's favorite pass time, it seems, is taxidermy. They steal dead bodies to porform autopsies on them, just for the fun of it. Add to this a beautiful teen who guards a strange antique bottle (that might or might not have mystical powers) and a talking dead bear, and you end up with a very strange, very interesting cast of characters. Kind of like the house of horrors gone wrong. <br />Revealing too much of the story would be giving it away. Instead, I will just say that In The Garden Of Poisonous Flowers veers in many different directions and never takes you down the most likely path. There are some very memorable moments, and some very touching ones, that will remain with your for a long time. <br />This is classic Kiernan. You can always count on her to deliver the goods and she does not disappoints this around. Full of imagination and wit, this is like a fairy tale gone gothic. Once you're done reading it, you will be tempted to start this magical little story all over again. Yes, it's that good!	2002-08-02

Spider is such a book. It is so overrought and self-referential that there is very little pleasure to be found in reading this book. Even when reading a so-called literary novel, one should still find some pleasure in it and be entertained a little.<br />Spider is haunted by images of his past; his mother's murder. Spider thinks that his father murdered his mother to replace her with a half-witted and foul woman. Spider has to live with the guilt and the hatred for the rest of his life. Now, twenty years later, he comes back to his home town to find the very same woman still haunting him. Did his father really murder his mother, or is Spider the victim of his very diseased mind?<br />This could make for some great psychological suspense and terror. Unfortunately, you will find very little of either in Spider. True, there are many good chilling moments in this is-he-sane-or-is-he-insane story. Sometimes, I found myself completely gripped by the story. But then, just a few sentences later, the author would come and ruin the effect with long winded and unimportant descriptions or self-referential comments. After a while, you just stop caring for the characters and the story. <br />Spider isn't a bad book. It is just a very poorly realized attempt at psychologial supsense. This book had a lot of potential and it is a real shame to see it all go to waste in such a horrible way. Spider never delivers the goods, unless what you're looking for is dissapointement and very little substance.	2002-08-02

It would have been easy for this book to get lost somehwere in the writing process. So many things happen and so many things are discussed. And yet, the reader never feels overwhelmed while reading this book. Instead, I found myself wanting more and more, totally captivated by the beauty, originality and magic of the story. <br />Cory is twelve years old and he is about to live through a year that he will forever remember. It all begins when, while helping his father out on his milk run, they find a dead body in a car that plunges into the bottom of a lake. Soon after that, strange things begin happening in the small town of Zephyr, and most of them are centered around Cory and his family and group of friends.<br />The novel is written in short episodes. Each new chapter is a new episode. It reminded me of those old cliffhanger movies. A chapter would end, marking the end of one adventure, just before a new one would begin. But of course, all these different storyline are linked by the major plotline; the one centered around that man who is sleeping dead at the bottom of the lake. Amazingly enough, by the end, everything ties up together and you realize that McCammon was thinking of the whole all the while, that everything you went through during those 600 pages was necessary and very much needed.<br />McCammon has created a wonderful coming-of-age tale that is not really horror, not really fantasy and not really pure drama. It crosses many genres, and that's exactly why this book is so magical. Like Stephen King's It or The Body, or like Dan Simmons's Sumemer Of Night, Boy's Life is a coming-of-age tale about a young boy who is standing on the threshhold of manhood. And during the year of his twelfth year, Cory will see and experience many things that will leave him changed forever. <br />And like Cory, thereader comes out of this book changed. It's one book you just don't want to see end. I felt sad when I turned the last page, and the temptation to just start the book anew was very much present in me. Do yourself a favor and read Boy's Life. I promise that you will not be disappointed!	2002-07-23

He choses roles that pleases him, no matter how small the film. He doesn't seem to care about the twenty million dollar paycheck other actors get, as he seems content just acting in films he'll be proud of. Hawke is also a novelist. His first book, the underrated and underappreciated The Hottest State, was a very brave recollection of angst and anxieties of being in your twenties in the 1990s.<br />Now, Hawke goes one step further and explores relationship in the seventies in his follow up, Ash Wednesday. Jimmy, an army brat who has gone AWOL, is madly in love with Christy, even though he can't always show it properly. But Christy is now pregnant and, terrified of the consequences and of what Jimmy will do, she decides to break the relationship and run away from Jimmy, going AWOL at her turn. <br />Jimmy does catch up with her and they do get married, though their problems are far from over. Are they really in love, or are they only afraid of being alone? Do they really want the relationship that marriage will force them into? These are just a few questions that are at the heart of Hawke's novel. <br />There are many nice and touching little moments in this book, as when Jimmy as a very sad encounter with his father, of even the mariage scene itself. Many moments touch you with their warmth and realism. But then, Hawke tends to be a little too philosophical, especially in the pages following these softer moments. His characters speak as though they are always analyzing everything that surrounds them and Hawke himself often does the same thing in his writing. In the end, all those great little moments are often ruined by these overwrought moments of philosophical analyses, something that just doesn't seem needed in this book.<br />The novel is written from both Christy's and Jimmy's point of view, and Hawke proves that he can write skillfully and thoughtfully. This book is not a failed attempt,it is just in need of a little more editing, or a little more work. I can't wait to read Hawke's next book. If he can find his true voice, then he'll be able to write something great and powerful. Until then, we'll just have to content ourselves with Ash Wednesday.	2002-07-23

In this anthology, she mixes classical pieces with modern ones, popular authors with lesser-knowns, and eventually ends up with a collection of short stories that offers many frights, many chills, and a whole lot of fun.<br />The anthology opens with Stephen King's pieces The Revelation of Becka Paulson and closes with a piece by Clive Barker. It's no coincidence that the two biggest names featured in this anthology open and closes the book. Both stories concentrate on women suffering from dementia. They are both unnerving in their own strange little ways. The two masters of horror are at their very best with these stories. <br />Other stories that are worthy of reading in this anthology are Patrick McGrath's Cleave The Vampire, a strange little tale of dementia, Christopher Fowler's The Master Builder, Jonathan Carroll's A Quarter Past You, Robert Hichens's How Love Came to Professor Guildea and Eric McCormack's The Festival.<br />Unfortunately, like all anothologies, this one has its share of stinkers, though this anthology has less than usual. Valerie Martin's Sea Lovers is a story that has no real point of view and it never really ends up anywhere. And Ruth Rendell's A Glowing Future shows promise, but it never really reaches its full potential. And you can see that ending coming from miles away! There are also a few more stories that are slightly unmemorable.<br />I also have to mention that Robert Aickman's story The Swords is very shocking, disturbing and a great tale of horror. They just don't right 'em like that anymore!<br />All in all, I Shudder At Your Touch is a good anthology that offers many stories that crosses genres and that are often very distubring and terrifying in their own little ways. This anthology made me discover many new authors that I cannot wait to read again, and I'm sure it'll do the same to you.	2002-07-22

Starting as a producer, then working as a journalist for Variety, he now writes books that try to analyze the many ways in which the Hollywood machine functions. His latest effort, The Shoot Out (written with producer Peter Guber), is a Hollywood tell-all that lacks the fervor and the wit that the other Bart books contained. <br />Overall, this book was done to analyze the ways in which today's Hollywood functions. Both authors have been around for a long time and they have seen the entertainment business change and shift during their years in Hollywood. If you take The Shoot Out to be a Hollywood a textbook, then I can't help but feel a little disappointed, as the information given in here is very generic and already widely known. The authors offer very little insight into the working ways of Hollywood and they tell us very little that is new or that I didn't already know.<br />But the book does get a little more interesting when you take it as a Hollywood tell-all. The authors offer a lot of dirt on Hollywood and they offer many stories taken from the inside, stories that were unknown to me until this day (ie, how The Godfather almost didn't happen because no studio wanted to touch it). And it is when the authors talk about their own experiences in the field that the book picks up a little steam and becomes more entertaining and intriguing. <br />It's obvious that these two men have many stories they want to share, so I wonder why they didn't include more of them. And they know what they are talking about as they are talking from hands-on experience. And yet, I can't help feeling a little disappointed with this effort. Maybe the authors tried to be a little too general to attract a bigger audience, or maybe they simply didn't have enough material to fill in an entire book. Not a great effort, even if it still has its moments.	2002-07-09

Let it be said that this is one book you will not soon forget!<br />Jonathan Safran Foer (yes, the book's main character bears the author's name) is going back to his homeland to find and woman and thank her for having protected his grandfather during the war. Were it not for this woman, his grandfather would have died because he was a jew. Jonathan goes to this country, where he will meet his tour guides, a young man and his grandfather who are about to embark on a journey that they, too, will not soon forget.<br />This book can be split in two equal parts. The first is written  by Jonathan as he recalls his family's history, starting from the late 1700s up unto the 1950s and the end of the war. This section of the book offers some very touching moments and some of the most graphic descrptions of the horrors of war. The second part of the book is narrated by the young tour guide, a man who can barely speak English. And so, all of his writing is done in broken English, as written by someone who knows English only as a second language.<br />Both sections are about discoveries. All of these characters are about to discover things about their lives that will leave them changed forever. But more importantly, all of these characters are about, through the dozens of revelations they will suffer through, to discover themselves. <br />I have to admit that it took about 50 pages to get into the book. But soon enough, I found myself completely engaged and unable to put it down. This is one intelligent read that never tries too hard. Nor is it so literary that you can't fully feel entertained. This is one great book that will stay engraved in my mind for quite some time. It is a wild and strange experience that left me feeling breathless and completely awed.	2002-07-01

His style was edgy and entertaining. His short two-or-three-pages chapters helped at building suspenseful plots. There was very little in his novels that was superfluous and his characters were usually very belivable. All of that seems like the very distant past.<br />Patterson's latest in the Alex Cross series, Violets Are Blue, is a book with a very intriguing concept that is very badly actualized. Cross is faced with the most ferocious killers of all; a pack of vampires who are killing all across America. There is nothing that links the murders together save the bite marks at the victims's necks. And Cross also has to deal with The Mastermind, an unknown mystery-man who has been tormenting Cross for quite some time now. It is in this book that Cross will finally come face to face with The Mastermind and try to put an end to his murderous spree.<br />I liked the vampire story part of the novel. It was different from what Patterson usually does and it felt a little fresh. I thought it would actually jolt a little life in his tired series. But then, the book had to drag on with The Mastermind plot. The book is also ruined with idiotic characters, pointless twists (Alex Cross seems to be running all over the place with no aim in mind) and way, way, way too many pop-culture references (as if the country's best psychologist/cop/investigator/father has the time to see all those movies and reading all those books he keeps mentioning).<br />This book reads more like an outline for a movie than an actual novel. I don't know if Patterson has lost his touch (maybe that's why he is writing more and more collaborative efforts these days), but this book goes to show how a once prominent author can easily lose his touch. The Alex Cross novels used to be intellige and full of great twists and turns. Alex Cross used to solve cases with his mind and his wit. That is no more.<br/>There is very little fun to have reading Violets Are Blue. Hopefully, Patterson is only in a slum. I can't wait to finally read another good Alex Cross novel.	2002-06-25

Though a non-ficition book, it does not fall victim to an overought style like most books in the genre can. Bell's writing is very easy to read and very informative. He does not shy away from the truth and always gives his opinions (and justifies them!).<br />Bell investigated (for nearly 20 years) the vampire legend which began in New England (and still exists there) starting in the late 1600s. It seemed that people believed that the consumption, a deadly desease at the time, was caused by vampires. Bell takes many scenarios and cases he has found throughout New England and investigates them, trying to explain the origin of the legend as well as its outcome.<br />The book lags a little when Bell tries to link the whole phenomenon with popular myth. This vampire legend differs greatly from the Dracula legend we are used to these days. These vampires are not night-walkers and blood sucking fiends, they kill from their grave! His short lesson in pop culture history is a little too long and a little too obvious for my taste. <br />I really enjoyed this book. It is a great lesson in history and in American folklore. This is one book that I will want to come back to again and again. This is one of the rare non-fiction book about vampires which does make sense and which does take the reader somewhere we haven't been before.

And for that, Bell's Food For The Dead deserve to stand on a high pedestal on top of all the other paranormal/non-fiction books out there.	2002-06-20

Once more, he comes at us full force to have us face the most terrifying and most disturbing nightmare of all: Death.<br />A woman considering having an abortion is kidnapped by a couple who desires a child. They will keep her prisoner for the full term of her pregnancy in the hopes of keeping the child for themselves once it comes. They will torture her and torment her for their own pleasure as they await the child's arrival. <br />Dark, disturbing and terrifyingly realistic, Right To Life is a novella only the twisted mind of Jack Ketchum could conceive. Ketchum's strength lies in presenting his readers with realistic horror. His stories rarely rely on the paranormal, opting instead to investigate the demons that can plague one's mind. And this book isn't an exception to the rule.  <br />Right To Life is a psychological tour the force that will leave you breathless. It's the kind of book which you will forever remember, which will haunt you long after you have finished reading it. This is Ketchum at his best and darkest.	2002-06-13

And, besides for the few inevitable misses, the stories collected in this book are great. Some of the best names in horror and suspense fiction are collected in here; Jack Ketchum, Patricia Highsmith, Muriel Gray, Ray Bradbury, Lovecraft... The book collects both old and new and the result works surprisingly well.<br />The real reason to get this book is for Jack Ketchum's brilliant story The Box, about a man who sees his family deteriorate after they encounter a strange individual who has something to share. But there is also a brilliant story by Christopher Fowler here, where a man's worst nightmare becoems reality. Patricia Highsmith's tale mixes fantasy and horror quite masterfully. And Tabitha King's story, although a little too long, is a frantic portrayal of a woman in panic. <br />Thomas Tessier, Alex Hamilton, Lisa Tuttle, Edith Wharton, Muriel Gray and Jay Russell and John Wyndham all present stories that are very entertaining, imaginative and, at times, brilliant.<br />Unfortunately, the book does also present a few misses. Bradbury's tale of a man lost in an unknown town is very predictable and boring. Mark Helprin's Letters From The Samantha goes round and round in circles and never stops anywhere. And Victoria Rothschild gets in way over her head with her strange little tale.<br />But overall, this book is a keeper. Michele Slung has collected a slew of memorable story that are often suspenseful, often scary and mostly entertaining.	2002-06-09

Here, you have a group of kids with big dreams and high hopes who, during one very strange summer, will be faced with the oddest and most terrifying things.<br />Kevin has been in love with the very same girl forever. But just as he's about to confess his love to her, she meets a guy named Peter. Pete is five years older than she is and, from the get-go, Kevin doesn't like the guy. Strange things happen everytime Pete and his friends are around. Things none of them can explain. Things so strange and fantastic that they cannot be real.<br />But real they are. And soon enough, Pete and his friends kidnap Nikky. It is up to Kevin, his brother Jesse and two of their friends to go save her in a world very far from this one.<br />The novel starts as a very straight forward coming-of-age tale. But halfway through the book, the story becomes horror/fantasy, when Kevin and his group have to enter a Neverland-like world in order to save Nikky. <br />Golden takes the Peter Pan story and toys with it to fit his needs. And the result is quite impressive. This is one of the most imaginative novel I've read in years. Unfortunately, the book does get a little out of hand in its last fifty pages, where the climax becomes a little too cahotic to really makes sense. But that aside, STRAIGHT ON TIL MORNING is a wonderful mix of fantasy and horror and should please fans of both genres. Golden is one of the most original voice in horror fiction, and this book should not be missed.	2002-06-09

He is able to take normal looking and normal sounding characters and place them in situations of complete and utter horror. And he does it once again - and rather masterfully - with his short but extremely complex novel Trauma (aka Bonnie Winter).<br />Bonnie is a tired mother and wife who works two jobs to support her family. By day, she sells cosmetics and by night, she works with her crime scene clean up crew. You see, when someone dies a horrible death, the police will not clean the mess that is left behind. It's up to people like Bonnie to clean up whatever is left at the crime scene once the body has been removed.<br />But as the days crawl by, as Bonnie gets more and more confused by her failing marriage, her abusive husband and her strange and slightly distrubed son, and as the things she sees at the crime scenes she is supposed to clean up get weirder and weirder, Bonnie will slowly began her tumble down into dementia.<br />Masterton found the perfect form to tell his story. The chapters are short and often straight to the point. The descriptions are sparse though he gives the reader just enough to sends shivers down their spines. By the time the climax comes by, you can't be sure if Bonnie is really insane or if what is sees and feels is actually real.<br />I really enjoyed this novel. It can be quite gruesome at time, but the gore never takes over the psychological suspense. The only problem I have with this book is that I wanted more. It's very short, though I don't think that having any more would have made the book any better. It's quite thrilling and intriguing as it is. Masterton proves once and for all that he is one of the most underrated voice in horror ficiton.	2002-05-31

As a matter of fact, it is the best novel of its kind I have read since Rice's The Vampire Chronicles. This book is erotic, frightening, bloody and extremely compelling. Jemiah Jefferson is a bright new voice in horror fiction that should not be missed.<br />When Ariane encounters a strange man in her office, little does she know that this very man will change her life for ever. For you see, this elegant, pale and enigmatic man is a vampire, one that has lived through centuries and who is tired of his dark gift. And it is because of him that Arian will meet Daniel, another vampire, one who is not afraid of anything had who has a very dark side. Daniel is actually very reminiscent of Rice's Lestat because of his erratic and often violent behaviour.<br />Jefferson's mythology is actually different from the one you'd expect to find in such a book. Her vampires can still travel through the day, as long as they protect their skin and eyes, and they can eat and drink like humans. All of this only makes their actions more terrifying. <br />I have to admit that I was not expecting much from this book. I thought I was picking up a quick read that would suffice my vampire-fiction craving until the next new Rice book. But once I was done reading Voice Of The Blood, I quickly realized that I had just read a wonderfully amazing book which is very fun and very entertaining. Jefferson's voice is very poetic and definite. A truly wonderful book from a greatly talented author that will please all Anne Rice fans.	2002-05-28

She isn't there to give us a grammar lesson. She wants to tell us how she does it and, hopefully, teach us a thing or two in the process. <br />It's great fun to read this legendary author's thoughts. After all, Highsmith has written some of the best novels of suspense; The Two Faces Of January, The Blunderer and, of course, The Talented Mr Ripley series. In this book, she collects her thoughts on the genre and on the process of writing. And she tells us quite bluntly that what worked for her as an author might not work for us. But I think that any author (or fan) could and will learn a thing or two from this author's lessons.  <br />The best parts are when Highsmith takes her own books apart to show her readers that not even the established writer is safe from the typical mistakes most writers will make at one time or another. And if there is one thing that you'll come away with from reading this book is that writers (pros and beginners alike) have to learn to practice and practice and practice some more. Practice, according to Highsmith, does make better. And that is one lesson I will not forget.	2002-05-26

And judging from those two stories (although both are slightly entertaining) you get very little chills or frights. Just a lot of gross-out writing, and a lot of shocking-just-for-the-fun-of-shocking writing.<br />Harding is obviously the least practiced author of the two. His story is very short and it could have benefitted from a little more work. We have two men with a dead female body who have less than honorable intentions in mind for it. The story is a fun read though it is far from being memorable.<br />Eward Lee is a miss-or-hit writer. He can write amazing stories (some of his short stuff is the best stuff I've read in the fields of horror and sci-fi) but he can also often be pretentious and overought. But this time, surprisingly enough, Lee falls right in the middle. His story is entertaining, original but it often relies too much on the cheap gross-outs instead of the more frightening and darkly disturbing stuff Lee is capable of. <br />So all in all, we have two unmemorable stories brought together. The book is nicely bound and is a nice addition to your Lee or Harding collection. But overall, it won't make the ground under your feet shake with frights or cheap thrills. Both authors are capable of better.	2002-05-23

Only, something goes wrong during the operation and Todd finds himself disfigured. While he recoups from the surgery, he moves to a mansion in what is known as Coldheart Canyon, a house which his agent, Maxine, found for him. The house was once owned by a famous and beautiful silent-era film star. It is big, beautiful and completely hidden from the rest of the world. So well hidden, in fact, that it is impossible to find without a map.<br />The moment Todd moves into the house, he realizes that something isn't quite right with the place. First off, he encounters Katya Lupi, that famous silent film star herself, although she is still young and beautiful. And then, he encounters many strange looking creatures and sees hundreds of ghosts. Stranger still, those ghosts are the spirits of old, deceased Hollywood stars, souls that want something out of the Canyons, souls that won't rest until they get what they desire. <br />Todd also has to deal with his number one fan, a woman who will come to play a major role in this opus that can be read both as a horror novel, a fantasy and, most importantly, a bittersweet Hollwyood satire. <br />I enjoyed this book a great deal. It is brilliantly written (as always, Barker's prose is very poetic and elegant) and the plot is so fantastic that it is hard to resist it. And all the characters in this book are very realistic; the fan is completely three-dimensional, Katia is the longing ghost who is afraid to let go of the fame and beauty she once knew (she's a monster, yes, but she is so well conceived that you still find yourself caring for her), and the Maxine character goes much beyond your average bitchy-woman-in-power character.<br />The only character who you can't really love is Todd himself, though in a way, that never becomes a problem. In fact, it elevates the book even higher because Barker has created a hero you can't really identify with, a hero who's actions are often herratic but with whom you can't help sympathize with.<br />Yes, the book is long. Yes, it has many plot twists and three different climaxes. But it's a great deal of fun. And it's great to read Barker's take on Hollywood. It's obvious that he has mixed feelings about the factory that doesn't always treat him all that well. This is a major epic that, once given the chance, will make you laugh, will scare you and will make you care dearly for most of its characters.	2002-05-22

It is fast-paced, well written, very suspenseful and completely engrossing. It has belivable characters and a plot that, although far-fetched at times, is so filled of twists and turns that you can't help but like its cahotic storytelling.<br />A young couple think they had it all; Will is a brillian doctor who has just invented a new drug which will make him rich. But they'll soon learn how quickly your life can take a turn for the worse. Little does Will know that Joe, his dumb-witted cousin Huey and his wife Cheryl plan on kidnapping his daughter for a ransom.<br />Joe believes he has the perfect plan. He's done it five times already and plans on doing it again. But Joe has an ulterior motive in mind this time around. He wants revenge, he wants to see blood, not just the ransom money. And as he kidnaps Will's daughter and takes Will's wife for ostage, he will change the rules of his own game to bring the stakes on step higher.<br />Of course, the plot is so all over the place that it's not fully belivable. But Ile's style of writing makes this fact bearable. His writing is striaght-to-the-point and trim; there is very little writing that is superfluous of unnecessary. Every word is there for a purpose. And his short sentences and sharp dialogue only add to his already edgy style.<br />I had a blast reading this book. It's a very quick read that will keep you turning the pages all through the night. This novel can be so intense that you won't be able to put it down.	2002-05-08

Everything is touched upon; from the provenance of ideas, to the actual writing (grammar, techniques, and dos and don'ts), selling, publishing, revising, finding an agent...

Editors, comic book writers, short story writers, novelists... Everyone is given a say in this book. And for any writer who wants to get a start in the genre, this book does offer a lot of very good and constructive advice.<br />The real great piece in this book is Jack Ketchum's essay on Splatter Lit and its hero, telling us how to create a realistic hero and how to make him sound/seem real. As a matter of fact, many of the essays in this book talk about realism; how to make your story sound real, how to make the tone and mood real, how to create realistic settings... Plot, techniques, the horror market, the independent press and agents are also discussed in great lengths. <br />Unfortunately, this book is downplayed a little as it includes too many retrospection on works by artists that didn't really work in the writing relm of horror. I'm thinking here of Owl Goingback's piece on classical horror films, which, although good, doesn't really offer any advice to the writer wannabe.<br />But those few essays aside, this book is a must for anyone who is interested or who wants to break into the horror relm. It's a great collection by the masters, including Ketchum, Joyce Carol Oates, Stephen King, Harlan Ellison, Elizabeth Massie and many many more.	2002-05-01

It is filled with half a dozen characters who are all very self-indulged, who all speak the same and who all act the same. The plot crawls by at the speed of a turtle and then turns to pure cahos in the end, as Desomnd tries to write a shocking and thought-provoking ending while instead writing a very confusing and completely cahotic ending.<br />The novel's narrator is a very confused senior who is trapped between the love of two women and who still feels guilt from his ex-roommate's suicide. But now, things are about to get even more crazy when he begins seeing the ghost of an ex-student everywhere. His craziness grows to the point where he'll no longer be able to see clearly between what is real and what isn't.<br />The plot itself has its moments, but there isn't enough material here to sustain an entire book (and the novel itself barely has 250 pages). It takes nearly 100 pages for the plot to really begin and when it does, Desmond's style becomes very messy. It's almost as if he doesn't know if he wants his novel to be a dramatic exploration of the hectic campus life or if he wants it to be a ghost story. Both stories are okay, but the mix does not mesh well once it is all blended together.<br />I have to admit that I was very disappointed by this book, especially after hearing so many great things about it. Hopefully, Desmond will find his voice (and a good editor) with his futures tries.	2002-05-01

Before trying his Bosch series, I decided to go with a stand alone so that I'd get a good feel of this writer's style and tone. And now that I'm done reading Blood Work, all I can say is that if his other books are half as good as this one, I'm in for a great ride!<br />Blood Work is that rare suspense thriller that is completely unpredictable. After receving a heart transplant, McCaley meets the donor's sister only to learn that his heart came from a murdered woman. Out of guilt and out of need, he decides to go on a mission to find the the donor's murderer. But the more he investigates, the more secrets he uncovers, secrets that will shock him and leave him completely baffled. <br />I couldn't put this book down. And I could not predict where it was heading. Every time I thought it was going in one direction, the story would completely surprise me and take me in another. And the story is very belivable and the characters very realistic. Blood Work is that rare thriller that works on every level.<br />I'm in awe of Connelly's writing style and of his talent at writing believable and highly suspenseful prose. I've discovered a new writer that I can't wait to return to.	2002-04-26

Part of what is now being called splatter lit, the books was supposed to offer new kinds of thrills as it takes the supposed-to-be-good story of Santa Claus and turn it into a violence mess of violence and sex. <br />But in the end, the book was a big disappointment. Sure, the story does have a nice dose of originality; here you have Santa who's tired of his borish job and who finds solace when he starts an affair with the Tooth Fairy. But then, of course, Mother Claus (called Anya) discovers her husband's unfaithfulness and seeks vengence. Add to this a jealous Easter Bunny and you have a basis that could have formed a very twisted, very original story. <br />Unfortunately, Devereaux doesn't seem to know exactly where his story is heading and because of that, the plot is very thin and the book itself feels long, even though it is only 350 pages. There is A LOT of repetition and a few very long passages that should have been edited out since they do very little for the plot except to stall it. <br />It's too bad, because this book could have been a great re-telling of the whole Santa and Tooth Fairy mythos. But instead, it stalls into the same place for too long and never reaches its full potential. This is far from being the revisionist tale I was expecting.	2002-04-18

Her follow-up, The Treatment, reteams the reader with Jack Caffery, a London DI who once again finds himself on the trail of a sadistic killer. Only this time, the murders hit a little too close to home.<br />A man kidnaps an entire family and then performs horrible acts on them. Jack needs to find the killer before he takes over another family. But at the same time, Jack has to face his past. When he was younger, his older brother disappeared and was presumably kidnapped by one of Jack's neighbours. When this man dies, Jack is thrown back into his past and forced to come face to face with the demons that have been haunting him ever since his brother disappeared.<br />This is a very realistic thriller that will shock, excite and trouble you all at once. It is amazingly well written and it is very powerful in its realistic portrayal of human emotions and of violence. Though the book is often gory, the violence is written with tact and skill; the book has enough darkness to shock the reader but never repulses him. The plot is very intricate and full of believable twists and turns. You'll never be able to guess what's coming next. <br />Mo Hayder is the brightest new voice in the mystery/thriller field. I cannot wait to read her next book. There is no doubt in my mind that The Treatment will be the best mysetery of the year.	2002-04-12

From the first sentence on, you are immediately thrown into the book's plot, embarking a rollercoaster ride that will leave you feeling both dizzy, disturbed and highly satisfied. <br />Jack Caffery is the a new DI in London and in his first weeks on the job, he's immediately face with a strange case that involves a sadistic killer who preys on young prostitutes and proceeds at killing them in a horrible ways. When the corpses of five missing women are discovered, the case is immediately thrown open and Jack unwittingly finds himself standing at its very center. <br />The killer is inevitably called Birdman due to the gruesome ways in which he kills his victims. But the similarities to Jack The Riper aren't left unnoticed and the London press is having a field trip with this breaking story. And as Jack tries to deal both with his past and his present-day personal life, he will also have to try and find The Birdman before he can kill again.<br />Dark, disturbing and shocking are only three of the many words I can think of to describe this book. This one is not for the faints of heart; the novel is often very graphic in its portrayal of violence. But Hayder is a very skilled writer who knows when and where to draw the line. She gives the reader just enough to disturb him but not so much that the reader will be left appaled and disgusted with the book.<br />I simply couldn't put this one down. Birdman is an amazing thrill ride that you won't want to see end. If all thrillers could be like this one, then we'd surely be in heaven.	2002-04-03

Beasts cannot be called a novel, nor can it really be called a story for that matter as nothing really happens in those 140 pages. The lines between protagonist and antogonist are constantly being blurred in this failed effort, something which, under different circumstances, could have been greatly challenging. Unfortunately, the story's short length does not permit any such challenge upon the reader.<br />Gillian is a student at a small College in 1975. She wants to become a poet though she feels that her poetry always fails her. She joins a highly respected poetry class which is thought by a man who is able to attract the love of any student he desires, even if he isn't a model-type and even though he isn't thin or really handsome.<br />Gillian's obssession with this professor and his sculptress wife grows into a strange kind of obssession. And she is not the only student experiencing these kinds of feelings; it seems that every female student on the campus is in love and is tormented by this professor. These obssessions run so deep that the female students are invitably forced into strange acts as their minds become blurred by their infatuation.<br />Oates's prose is at its best when she writes in the first person and this novella shows how skilled and talented she can be. I would just have preferred getting a stronger, more involving plot. Instead, we get pages after pages of Gillian rambling about how she loves this man and how he loves her back and how she wants to be the only woman of his life. After a while, these ramblings become a little distracting and repetitive.<br />Overall, Beasts is a quick little forgettable read that brings little to the reader save for mild enjoyment. Oates is capable of much better; it's not a bad effort, though her talents are much more defined than Beasts would let you think.	2002-03-25

His newest collection, Everything's Eventual, might very well be his best and most mature effort in the relm of short fiction. This collection shows perfectly why King is at the top of his game and why he's so beloved by millions of fans around the world.<br />The 14 stories included in this collections are all worth reading. There are only two which I found disappointing; 1408, a haunted hotel room story that seems kind of cliched for someone of King's talent, and Lunch At Gotham Cafe, a strange horror tale about a crazy maitre d'. Those two stories aside, the collection is quite spectacular.<br />First off, any fans of the Dark Tower series will want to read The Little Sisters of Eluria, a prequel to King's opus which is masterfully written and quite chilling. Then there's Autopsy Room Four and That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is In French and Riding The Bullet, three top-of-the-notch horror tales that will chill you to the bone. And his story Lt's Theory Of Pets, a strange blend of comedy and horror, is not to be missed.<br />Then, there are the non-horror stories, some of King's best works in years, including The Death Of Jack Hamilton, In The Death Room and the truly wonderful, truly amazing The Man In The Black Suit. These stories should once and for all prove that King is a lot more than just a popular genre writer. <br />But the real reason to read this anthology is for the title story, Everything's Eventual, a great little story that is mysterious, quite original and very satisfying. It's as good, if not better, than anything Kafka has written. That story alone is worth the price of the book.<br />King has never ceased to amaze me. He has written hundreds of wonderful stories and dozens of truly amazing books. He is very much American's most prolific - and most talented - writer.	2002-03-23

Jack Ketchum's \\"Luck\\" is a great little campfire tale, Rick Hautala's \\"The Screaming Head\\" is about a horrifying folklore legend that comes to life and Yvonne Navarro's \\"Divine Justice\\" plays with the idea of heaven and hell in a Western setting.<br />But there are three great masterpieces of the bizarre in this book. Richard Laymon's \\"The Hangman\\" is a classic ghost story mixed with the elements of the Western tale and ends up being a great, satisfying read. Lawrence Walsh's \\"The Devil's Crapper\\" is a funny and twisted story that will make you laugh with every word and every sentence. And Adam-Troy Castro's \\"The Magic Bullet Theory\\" (the longest story in the book) is an epic tale that is brilliantly written and highly satisfying.<br />And if that's not enough for you, there are also stories by Edward Lee, M. Christian, Nancy A. Collins and a very twisted, very disturbing story by Robert Devereaux. Skull Full Of Spurs has it all; horror, action, fantasy, humour... It has something to please every reader of the genre. This is one collection you'll want to come back to time and time again. So saddle up part'ner and get ready to be entertained!	2002-03-21

The novel is highly entertaining and will keep you guessing until the very last page.<br />Patrick and Angie are two private investigators who are hired to find a cleaning lady who has gone missing. The woman is believed to have stolen some important documents from the senator for whom she worked. But the more they investigate, the more they realize that the case is much more complicated than that.<br />After several ingenious plot twists, the novel turns into a battle of the races as the streets of Boston become the site for a boiling racial war. And Patrick and Angie will be caught smack in the middle of it. Not only is the novel a great mysetery, it is also a very powerful introspection on the race issues that are still being debated today.<br />The book never ceases to surprise you. You can't never predict what will come next. And Lehane's style, an author I admire more and more with each book of his that I read, is witty and often cynically funny.<br />With A Drink Before The War, Lehane has created a highly belivable potboiler that will keep you intrigued until the very last page. But one word of advice: Do not start this book unless you intend on finishing it in one sitting.	2002-03-17

Kelley Armstrong proves that you can still take an old, tired and overused storyline and make it great and entertaining. Her book is sexy, intelligently written and highly entertaining.<br />Elena is a young woman who was once bitten by a werewolf, which inevitably turned her into one as well. Only problem is that in Armstrong's world, only males are allowed to be werwolves as the curse is passed down through the male line. But she survives the change and The Pack, an organized group of werwolves, decide to keep her alive.<br />She does not like her life as much as she ought to and so she escapes to Toronto, only to be brought back to her New York dwellings (the home of The Pack) when strange murders start occuring. She is quickly thrown into a plot involving a group of Mutts (werewolves who are not part of The Pack and who only want to cause trouble for the organization) who only wants to see The Pack disappear.  <br />Violent, dark and often wittingly funny, Bitten is a very original novel that takes the werewolf legend and plays with it amazingly well. The book reminded me of the early efforts from Anne Rice; Armstrong, just like Rice did with vampires, rejuvinates the legend on her own, putting a much-needed life back into the genre. <br />Any fans of the genre should be pleased with this book. And non-horror fans will also find something to like here; Armstrong's prose is very beautiful, straight to the point and extremely colorful. This one is not to be missed!	2002-03-12
US	49059365	R24YX9NH2TO4SP	0060008725	906069744	Tishomingo Blues	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Classic Leonard	Tishomingo Blues is a classic Leonard novel, filled with colorful characters, witty dialogue and short, brief, straightforward prose. And although some would find Leonard's style to be tiring after a while, since his writing is highly dialogue-based instead of relying on prose, this one is so much fun that you'll forget about all of that.<br />Dennis is a diver who tours the country in order to perform for money. When he gets a job at the Tishomingo Casino and Hotel, he has no idea what awaits him there. It is here that he will meet Robert, a gangster who has a thousand different plans in his head and who is a master at scamming others. It's there that he will meet Charlie, an old baseball star who's more obssessed with the game than anything else. It's here that he will meet a slew of amusing, sexy women. And it's here that he will meet Walter and Jarvis, two bad guys who want Dennis's neck as he as witnessed them murder a man.<br />As all these characters entertwine, we are led into a civil war reenactment that ends into a bloody battle filled with backstabbing and evil-doings. Tishomingo Blues is always taking you in various directions, as Leonard plays with his characters as much as he plays with his readers. As a matter of fact, Leonard seems to be having a blast writing this book; the whole novel has a very light-hearted, fun-filled tone to it.<br />This is classic Leonard. I have to admit that I would love it if Leonard would rely a little more on prose. His books rely mostly on dialogue, feeling like scripts more than actual prose. But then again, Leonard is a master at writting witty, belivable and intelligent dialogue, so it's not hard to forget about the lack of narrative. Just end up just going with the flow.<br />Toshimingo Blues is a very fun book that will keep you entertained until the very last page. It's a fast read that never disappoints. It's not Leonard at his best, but it's Leonard at his most fun.	2002-03-06

His writing is powerful and touching, though often too poetic. Beautiful Losers is, in fact, a poem disguised as a novel. It is a postmodernistic work of Canadian fiction that, although beautiful, refuses to make sense.<br />The story's nameless narrator is scarred by the death of his wife, Edith, and of his best friend, F. As the three were part of a very strange romantic triangle, the posthumous revelations the narrator comes to during the course of the story are highly revealing and often shocking. As he mourns his wife, he cannot hide the fact that he was also in love with F. and his strange view on life.<br />A historian in disguise, the narrator is also doing research on an Native saint named Catherine, who's story is an echo of the things the narrator has went through and is going through. As these four chracters entertwine, and as more and more painful secrets are revealed, we are forced into a chaotic world where sense does not exist, where order and sanity are always at stake.<br />A highly poetic effort, Beautiful Losers ins't a book that should be read quickly. Just like the prose, the reader should take his time while reading it. It's too easy to miss the great irony and humour behind all the darkness and sadness of the prose. Cohen created a world where surrealism, sexuality and violence are part of the ordinary, where order seems to fail with a shocking consistancy and where disorder seems to rule.	2002-03-04

She hears a man whisper the words: &quot;I'm coming to get you!&quot; Seconds later, a man enters her work palce, holding on to a gun. <br />This is how the three stories of Triage begin. But what follows this  differs greatly from one story to the next. The three masters of independent horror - Lee, Ketchum and the late Richard Laymon - each tell their own take based on this scenario.<br />Laymon's tale is dark and disturbing; the story becomes a race for survival as the killer chases after the heroine as she tries to find a place to hide in the building where she works. Lee's take, although fun and different, is a bit over the top and a little too long. He decided to bring his story to the year 2220 and sets in a a spaceship that just happens to be on a Godly misison.<br />The real reason to get this book is for Ketchum's take, which is called 'Sheep Meadow Story'. It takes the reader through a very realistic nightmare, where a down-on-his-luck man tries to make sense out of his disturbed existence. This story alone is well worth the price of the book. Another great story from an amazing, underrated writer.<br />This book is a great one for any horror fans. It has it all! I was greatly pleased by it and I know this is one book which I'll want to read again and again.	2002-03-01

But one day, everything came tumbling down when his family is killed by a sadistic killer. After that, Charlie's life falls apart and he quits his job only to find himself becoming a private investigator.<br />He keeps on searching for his wife's killer, but he also takes on a new case. A murderer is abducting small children and killing them. Does this case tie in to the murders of his wife and daughter? Are the ghosts he is seeing in his mind real, or is he going insane? And what about those strange phone calls he is receiving, from a man who calls himself the 'Traveling Man' and who claims that he is the one who killed his family? A very complicated plot insues, once that will take Bird across America as he searches for two very notorious killers.<br />If I could, I would actually give this book three and a half stars. Although the plot is always intriguing and very intricate, filled with thousands of plot and turns, the book maybe has a few too many supporting characters. So many different people enter and leave Charlie's life that after a while, you lose track of them all. And Connolly, although a very talented writer, tends to give too many details that are unnecessary. <br />This book was marketed as the next Silence Of The Lambs, though it isn't as good or as striking as Harris's classic. And yet, I found myself totally absorbed by the book. This is a very promising debut by a terrific new talent. I cannot wait to read Connolly's sequel to find out what happens next with Charlie Bird. A good, if somewhat slightly flawed, debut.	2002-02-26

Forensic examiner Michael M. Baden doesn't shy away from the facts; he tells his readers EVERTHYING about what his job consists of. <br />The book has various chapters, all of them written with  great care and professionalism. But the book is always fun to read. The best chapters are the ones on maggots, on heads and on the autopsies themselves. Baden recalls his experience while on the OJ Simpson case and during the autopsy of a corpse that could have been Princess Anastasia. He tells us about the strangest and dumbest things he has seen during his very long career, all the while sharing every single gruesome detail with his readers.<br />This is a great nonfiction book that tells us a lot about this strange and fascinating profession. It's also a great true-crime collection of anecdotes and stories. A must for any fans of the true crime genre.	2002-02-17
US	49059365	R85TLW56I09W3	0385503822	782272714	The Summons	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Failed Goodness	The Summons had all the elements of a great page turner. But somehow, somewhere, something went wrong. This time around, Grisham sacrifices content and plot in order to make his yearly contribution to the best seller list.<br />A forty-something man is summoned back to his family home by his dying father. When he gets there, he finds his father dead. As he is waiting for his drug-addicted brother to arrive, he finds over three million dollars hidden inside a dozen boxes. What should he do with the money? Keep it for himself? Do nothing? Tell his brother, who is a drug addict and who will spend the money on drugs and booze?<br />He hides the money while he can take care of his father's estate and decides what to do with it. But of course, somebody else knows about it and wants it. Now, he must find out who that person is before something bad happens.<br />The novel has the potential to be a good page-turner, like Grisham's The Firm or The Partner. But all the characters are so forgettable (the main character, a law professer who makes 150 000 dollars a year keeps reminding us how he doesn't need this money) that the book becomes tedious after a while. And, somehow, Grisham's very distinctive style seems to be missing in this outing. The sentences are always short and the vocabulary is too simple for Grisham. The prose doesn't really have any style. This felt more like a movie outline than a real novel. <br />I had trouble keeping interest while reading The Summons, something that has never happened with Grisham before. Hopefully, this is will be a one-time thing and his next one will be as good as his earlier novels. If not, Grisham will lose one huge fan.	2002-02-17

But the more I read on, the more I got into the story. This one is pure horror; a book that relies on plot and mood more than anything else. And surprsingly enough, it works superbly!<br />Mark and Phil are hiking across the mountains somewhere in Maine when a horrible accident leaves Phil badly injured. As Mark is about to rescue his friend, he sees a large hairy beast steal Phil's body away. From then on, the book follows Mark's trek as he tries to rescue his friend from this unknown creature.<br />There is also a subplot about Mark's daughter and wife that I truly enjoyed. The good thing about this book is that you cannot really predict what will come next. The events are truly original and often terrifying. The book is somewaht of a cross between Jack Ketchum's Off Season and John Darton's Neanderthal. If you liked either of these books, or if you're a fan of the horror genre, then you should really enjoy this one.<br />My only problem with the book was its length. It's very short, not even 300 pages long. At least the writer was good enough to provide us with three additional short stories in order to have the book clock in at a more reasonable 380 pages. These short stories are fun and enjoyable, if only that. So overall, not a bad one at all. It surprised me and I cannot wait to read another book by this author!	2002-02-07

Although the book does offer some very terrifying moments, and although the plot is very tense and suspenseful, I still found myself feeling somewhat indifferent toward this book.<br />Molok, a Nightshade (a winged beast who hunts living flesh at night) is awakened after a few hundred years in dormancy. And he's hungrier than ever. He starts praying on the habitants of a small town in order to regain the strength he lost during his dormant state. <br />Now, it is up to three friends and a disbelieving police officer to put an end to things before they are too late.<br />The story offers many great moments. There is a scene that takes place at night in a lake that is just amazing. But I still found that the story dragged too much in moments. It could have been a lot trimmer. There is somewhat of a double-ending to this novel that wasn't necessary and there is a subplot about a rich man named Blake that is never fully finished or explained which leaves the viewer in the dark for way too long.<br />But overall, the book, for what it is, does offer many good moments. It's a good read, if only that.	2002-02-07

The real reason to get this book is to be able to analyze each list by yourself. Some books on those lists I've never heard of, others are still very well present today (Rebecca, Old Man And The Sea...). And some of the tendencies are quite strange; during the 60s, the biggest best selling novel was in fact The Bible. And it's quite frightening to see how unorignal the lists for the 90s were; only the names like King, Clancy, Steele, Clark, Cussler and Grisham seem to appear on those lists.<br />I really enjoyed going through this book. It's brief, straight to the point and very concise. A great piece of literary history!	2002-02-01

I first tried the author with Mischief (the second book in the series that culminates with The Infinite) and felt somewhat disappointed, especially after having heard so many great things about him. But all the notions I had were changed after reading The Infinite, a powerful and very haunting book set in a 'haunted' mansion of sorts. The story is more about its characters than it is about the situations they are placed in. It's great to see a horror book that tries to rely more on its characters and their problems and then draw the horror out of these problems.<br />A group of six meet in an old mansion which has been revamped by Ivy, a millionaire woman who wants to unravel the house from its many secrets. Most of the guest, save for the millionaire and Jack, a paranormal investigator, possess powers of the paranormal. One boy is a telekenesis, a woman can draw from a person's mind by touching an object they own, and a man is able to make events happen with his mind. All the characters are haunted by their powers and by their past.<br />Of course, strange things happen as they enter the house, but these things aren't necessarily hauntings. They are different, more powerful. This house is alive, but not with ghost. It is hiding something much more powerful, much darker. And one by one, the characters will have to come fact to face with the horrors of the house as well as their very own demons. <br />The story is great and very emotionally intense, the characters are vivid and highly believable, and the finale is just amazing and terrifying. I was very sad when I got to the last page, as I just didn't want this story to end. This is a masterpiece of horror. I cannot think of one thing I disliked about the book, nor can I think of one thing I'd want to complain about, save for the fact that I wanted more!<br />I can't wait to read the next Douglas Clegg novel. I was impressed enough by The Infinite to go out and buy all of his other books. If they're half as good as this one was, I'm in for a great ride!	2002-01-31

Now, a year later, he comes back with The Snow Garden, a novel centered around College life. Unfortunately, this time around, Rice falls flat on his face as this book is highly cliched, derivative and not very interesting.<br />This overlong novel (well, it does feel like it anyhow!) centers on a young freshman who, in his first year of College, befriends a professor and eventually begins a relationship with him. Of course, both men have many secrets which will be unveiled in the course of the story. Their relationship is far from being wholesome. Add to the mix a ten year old murder that still needs to be solved, a student who isn't what he really appears to be, and a slew of characters who are emotionally deficient and you end up with a story that reads like a bad soap opera.  <br />The book never interested me in the slightest. I actually found myself eager to get to the end. The book is also badly written; Rice's prose in Density Of Souls was very slow, lyric and beautiful. This time around, the words seem to have been put together with haste, as though Rice couldn't wait to get his second novel finished to get it out on the market. This one needed more care and editing in order to work. Instead, the novel ends up being a like a bad episode of Dawson's Creek, where you just want to grab the characters by the neck and slap them around a few times in order to make them stop complaining about their miserable lives.<br />I hope Rice's next book will be better. What started out as a promising career now seems much less enticing.	2002-01-25

A man - failed writer, husband and father- goes back to the old farm of his deceased friend in his hometown (a place he hasn't see in over forty years) in order to write a book about his childhood. But the farmhouse he moves into is less than invinting at times; strange things seem to occur on a regular basis. His laptop turns on by itself and leaves him cryptic messages, an old radio plays by itself, strange dogs that seem to grow with furious rapidity roam around the house and voices are heard during the night.<br />Simmons brings back many of the characters from his novel Summer Of Night, one of the best horror novels ever written. But this time, we can never be certain on who's real and who's not, who's good and who's not. This is not a sequel per se, more of a follow-up. <br />The pace of this book - which is short, clocking at a very trim 325 pages - is very rapid and very suspenseful. This is mostly a one man show as there is basically only one main character, but the novel never offers a dull moment. And there are some very creepy moments that will make the hair at the back of your neck stand and that will cover your entire body with shivers. And let me tell you right now that the finale is a killer! An amazing end to an amazing story. <br />I am pleased that Simmons finally wrote a sequel to Summer Of Night. This is one book that will not displease fans of the author and new readers alike. The book is scary, extremely well written and, as most Simmons book, often funny. Simmons proves once again that he is a master storyteller worthy of the best seller charts. He is the literary world's best kept secret. Do not let this one pass you by!	2002-01-22

Being a fan of Stephen King's work, and having awaited the Rose Red miniseries with impatience for some time now, I bought this book to wet my lips a little before tasting the main course. And surprise, surprise! The book is actually very entertaining and, at times, very suspenseful.<br />We are brought to Ellen Rimbauer's world who, at the age of 19, marries John, a man much older than herself. He builds her a house as a wedding present. The house will be the largest, most luxurious, most impressive house in Seattle. But little do they knwo that they have built this house on an Indian burial ground, which gives the house a soul. As the years go buy, the house grows hungry and more powerful. And so does Ellen. <br />The book is actually very well written and polished. You do get the feel and mood of the time (early 1920s to late 1940s) and you do get to know the real Ellen Rimbauer very well. She hides nothing from us. She tells us her every secret, her every desire. I felt a little bit like a voyeur reading this book. <br />The book itself is very beautifully done, though I didn't really like those childish drawings that appear randomly throughout the book. They serve no real purpose. I would have preferred more of the photographs which are displayed in the first part of the novel instead.<br />This book should be read before watching the miniseries, as it gives crucial information that will only help to your understanding of the film's plot. This is a very original, very suspenseful and very well written novel. I have to admit that I was surprised. Very pleasantly surprised!	2002-01-18

This book opens with the death of Adam, a man who seems to be loved by all, especially by the women of the small town of Salthill. His death touches many lives and brings upon many changes in this little town.<br />One couple seperates, because Adam's death brings upon fears of growing old in a Salthill man and forces him to have an affair with a young woman. Another woman, who was desperately in love with Adam, moves away for a year to pratice her art and cope with Adam's death. A lonely divorcee who yearns to see her son one last time searches for romance, and for herself, through Adam's death. And a woman goes on a one year trip, leaving her husband and family behind, in order to try and discover who Adam - a man of many secrets - really was.<br />The stories are not about Adam and yet, Adam is the focal point of the novel. This strange mix of mystery, romance and mid-age anxieties is often interesting, but also often unnerving. The book is very long (470 pages) and Oates often takes too much time to get to the point she wants to make. <br />Still, as always, Oates delivers great, three-dimentional characters who's fears, yearnings and pains seem very real on the page. You come to care for these characters because they act like real human beings, let it be through their bad decisions or mean-spirited action. No one in this book is perfect. But I cannot help but think that this book would have been much stronger and more powerful had it been a little trimmer. And the sugar-coated ending left somewhat of a sour taste in my mouth. <br />This is not great Oates. But The Middle Age: A Romance is still a somewhat entertaining read nonetheless.	2002-01-14

After having read her brilliant novel Lost Souls and her amazing collection Wormwood, I decided to read Exquisite Corpse. This dark novel is simply amazing; it is sombre, touching, disturbing and highly affecting. I will not soon forget this book.<br />This twisted tale displayss many tortured souls. The two major ones being two serial killers, one British and one American, who yearn to kill for reasons other than to simply satisfy a deep craving or thirst for blood. Killing is part of them, it is what and who they are. And it is only when they both join forces, and when they set their eyes on the beautiful and young boy Tram, that their thrist will develop into something greater, something they simply cannot ignore. There will be only one way for them to satisfy their craving: death. <br />Brite's prose is simply amazing. Reading her books is like getting trapped into a beautiful nightmare where every word has a powerful impact on the reader. And her characters are so well-developed that they feel very real, very present, even though they are trapped by the boundaries of the page. Brite has an amazing talent at bringing imaginary charcters to life.<br />Although this book is rather short (240 pages), it is never disappointing and it never offers a single dull moment. True, some scenes are rather disturbing, others shocking. And yet, the book has an effect on its reader in that it will remain embedded in your mind long after you have finished reading it. That is what I call great literature. Exquisite Corpse is Brite's finest book to date, a modern classic of terror and yearning, of loss and sadness.	2002-01-05

They are Ketchum at his very best. <br />The book also contains a very good and funny story by Stephen King, Chattery Teeth. But the real reason to get this book is to read Gary Raisor's The Right Thing, which is one of the most amazing stories I have ever read. That is one story I will not soon forget.<br />With other contributions from great writers like Bently Little, Lucy Taylor, Ed Gorman, Douglas Clegg and many others, this book is one that any horror fan should have on their shelf.	2002-01-05

They put out great books by famed horror authors, but also a great magazine of short stories and articles from the leaders of the horror field. This collection of short stories reunites some of the best stories to have been featured in the Cemetery Dance magazine. And although the second tome is a little less interesting than the first one (which held 2 AMAZING Jack Ketchum stories, a good Stephen King yarn and one of the most amazing stories I've read in years by author Gary Raiser), The Best Of Cemetery Dance Volume 2 still offers some great, chilling and, at times, disturbing stories.<br />This tome is more concerned with detective stories/ serial killer stories. Plainclothes and The Pattern are two of the best. One of the most interesting stories in this volume is Barry Hoffman's Trial By Fire, a twisted tale of revenge. Matthew Costello's Vacation is one of the most terrifying and twisted tale I've read in a long time. And Dick Laymon's Desert Pickup is a good little story with a neat twist. <br />But I was disappointed that the story by Poppy Z. Brite is only the prologue to her novel Lost Souls. And Melanie Tem's contribution is very disappointing - she is able to do much better than this. <br />Overall, this is a great book that any horror fan should get. I am a devoted fan of Cemetery Dance and this book only reminds me of why.	2002-01-05

It has an original story at its center, but so many subplots and unecessary character arcs that it becomes easy to lose interest in the narrative. This is a book which, unfortunately, should have been a hundred pages trimmer.<br />Gaiman brings us another one of his wonderfully imaginative plots; here, we have a tribe of old gods, all of them forgotten by American citizens, many of them dying or fading away. And then you have the new gods, the Wall-Street gods, the dot-com gods, the city gods, the ones that are powerful and presently active. But these gods also fear; today's people forget quickly and changes their taste often. A god can disappear in not time. And thus, a war is forming between the old gods and the new gods. And at the center of this war is Shadow, an ex-con human who is brought into all this madness against his own will and who will become a key character in the threatening war.<br />The plot per se is interesting. But Gaiman often forgets what the main tale is. Instead, he often gets lost in subplots and unnecessary story arcs that leads us nowhere. Often, you have sections of great suspense and thrills followed by twenty or thirty pages of nothing. Nothing at all. Reading this book can often get quite tiresome.<br />And I was disppointed that this book doesn't hold as much cynicism, wit and irony as other, better Gaiman books do. I am a huge fan of Neverwhere and Stardust; both books were highly imaginative and both books had this strange sense of dark humour that just amazed me. Those books were purely magical. There isn't much of that to be found in American Gods. The story is a bit dry and empty at its center.<br />Gaiman tried to write an American novel, when what he should have done is keep on doing with what he does best; British fantasy (if such a genre does exist). This is an epic book which has too many words and too many pages. And it's too bad, because within those 470 pages, you have a very good story which is dying to come out. It's just never really given the chance to do so properly.d, because within those 470 pages, you have a very good story which is dying to come out.

It is a very precise, very up-to-the-minute book that tells the reader everything he needs to know about this profession. The book is comprehensive in its comparision between the old traditional hands-on approach to film editing and the new wave of digital film editing that we are presently living through. Murch doesn't shy away from telling us his real opinions about both processes. He is very honest and truthful.<br />This book is very interesting. Murch, who edited films for Coppola as well as won an Academy Award for editing The English Patient, knows what he is talking about. He knows all the ins and outs of this profession and has no trouble telling his readers all about it. <br />I particularly enjoyed the second half of the book, where Murch goes into great details to describe this new wave of digital editing. He really gives us all the pros and cons of this new revolution.<br />My only problem with this book is that it was too short. Ending up being a little less than 150 pages, the book left me wanting more. Murch could have gone into more details of his own career and his own experiences as an editor. There is a section where he talks about the dilemmas he had editing The English Patient, where he had to mix his work life with his personal life, that is very affecting. I wanted more of that.<br />But overall, this book is a great one for anyone who is curious about film editing, for anyone who wants an introduction to this great art.	2001-12-22

The Golden Ring plays like a very rough draft of what could have been a touching Christmas story. Instead, the book ends up being annoyingly shallow and too hastily written.<br />We have a family who seems to know nothing but happiness. Every member of this family is too good, always trying to please others, always trying to do the good thing. One day, Anna, the youngest daughter, meets a young girl who is poor and who will not be celebrating Christmas because her parents have no money. Anna gives the girl her most prized possession: a gold ring that her parents gave to her on her ninth birthday. <br />Fine. It's all very sweet. But then, we get into a huge religious inner struggle as Anna searches her soul, trying to decide whether she did the right thing by parting herself from that ring. Believe me, no 10 year old is mature enough to take on such soul-searching!<br />The books is written without style. The sentences are short and much too easy. The book is even too simple for young children. More revision and a little more style would have been needed to make this book the special Christmas gift it wants to be. Instead, it ends up being a pale immitation of the much better, much more touching The Christmas Box.	2001-12-19

I usually read classics (A Christmas Carol, The Christmas Box) but each year, I also buy a few new Christmas books. This year, I read The Christmas Wish, a very nice, very touching and very entertaining story of love, forgiving and self-discovery.<br />Will comes home after his grandfather's death to take control of the family business. While there, he discovers something awful; his grandfather was probably having an affair with a woman named Lillian. For Christmas, his grandmother asks Will to find this Lillian so that they can make things straight and discover the truth. Will goes on a quest to find the mystery woman, but the quest also turns into a discovery of himself as he will learn how to enjoy life and how to really love again. <br />The book has some very touching moments and the story is quite engaging; it still was able to surprise me in the end. This is the perfect book to read around Christmas time; it will lift your spirits and put you in the mood for the most wonderful time of the year... Guaranteed!	2001-12-16

Quoyle, a man in his thirties, has just lost his wife and moves with his aunt and two daughters to Newfoundland, his family soil. It is here that Quoyle will have to learn and cope with the death of his wife and learn how to care for and live with his two young daughters. <br />The book is very post-modern. Short chapters, expressionistic prose and very litterate wording complement the story. Proulx has written a very engaging novel that forces you to pose yourself many questions about your own life. In a way, this book is an introspection on our own lives and miseries. In Quoyle, we find a character who's sadness and pain is very real and very present. Every page seeps with sadness.<br />But every page also weeps with the beauty and mysticism of the great Canadian White North. Proulx, who spends half of the year living in Newfoundland, obviously love the North and her love is apparent in every page of the novel.<br />It will be strange to see how Hollywood will adapt this wonderful novel. It is not an easy read nor is it a novel that has a plot per se. It is a slice-of-life story which is often sad, often ironic and often touching. There is also a lot of humour in the book, sweet and touching moments that brought smiles to my lips. This is a very rewarding read that will stay with me for quite a while.	2001-12-10

All of her stories are enthralling and intriguing. Even in her short fiction, her characters are three-dimensional and fully formed. And her poetic prose is always affecting.<br />This collection of 12 stories is just wonderful to sift through. And of course, some of the stories are better than the rest. My two favourites, Angels and How To Get Ahead In New York, brings back the charcters Steve and Ghost, the two protagonist of Brite's first novel, Lost Souls. Ghost is Brite's most interesting character; I would gladly live through many more adventures with him. It was a real pleasure to meet him again, even under the form of short ficiton (though I have to admit that I do crave another novel with Ghost as the main protagonist). <br />The story Optional Music for Voice and Piano is probably the best story in the book. It tells the story of a singer who's voice has the power to affect others in the most nefarious ways. And the stories The Ash Of Memeory, The Dust of Desire and The Elder are also worth more than one reading.<br />It is obvious that Brite is highly inspired by music in all of its forms and shapes. All of her stories are about the power and the beauty of music. But her prose also reads like music; it is always poetic, always beautiful, always telling and very musical. <BR>Miss Brite deserves to become a major voice in horror fiction. This collection of short stories just serves to prove that she is one of horror's best kept secret, a secret which is more than ready to erupt into something greater.	2001-11-30

It is heart-warming, intelligent and very touching. It is the perfect book to read during the holidays, or if you need to find something to cheer your soul up a little. It is the perfect book to put you into the Christmas mood.<br />The book contains two stories. The first is of Nathan, a young boy who's mother is dying of cancer. This will be her last Christmas as death is just around the corner. Nathan wants to make this Christmas the &quot;best ever&quot; for his mother. The second story is about Robert, a man who has just realized that he has put his business life in front of his family for way too long. When his wife tells him that she wants to leave him, Robert realizes that he has been a bad father and husband all these years and sets out to make things right again.<br />Both stories are wonderfully written and very entertaining. They also both offer great 'visuals' of Christmas as both famlies try to make this Christmas the best of their lives. Both stories are filled with hope, desire and love.<br />This is the perfect holiday book, the best of its kind since The Chirstmas Box. Its everything that you'd look for in a Christmas story.

After reading a bunch of them in a row in the early 90s, I finally realized that they were all really repetitive and too similar. So I quit. But now that Christmas is just around the bend, I decided to give this dual effort a try. And I can't say that I was please with the result.<br />The book is about the kidnapping of a rich mystery writer's husband and his female limo driver. Of course, every character, from the wife to the nosy neighbour to their daughter, becomes a private eye and try to solve the case. The problem is that you can't care for any of these characters; either they are really really bad or really really (almost saintly!) good. They have no flaws, they have no personality. You easily confuse the characters with one another because they are all so similar.<br />And the book is written, it seems, to appeal to young children, not the intended adult audience. The sentences are short and brief; there is no narrative style to this book. Reading it feels really tiring after a while since you get nothing worthy out of the experience.<br />It will probably be while until I pick up another Clark book. This one really disappointed me. I had to struggle to finish it, and the book is barely 300 pages long! Too predictable, too childish, too simple for my taste!	2001-11-25

Sure, the book is at time a bit repetitive and it feels a little recycled, but it's good harmless fun nonetheless.<br />Luther Krank has decided to skip Christmas this year. There will be no celebrating, no tree, no presents, no fruit cakes, no decorations. Instead, he will save the money he usually spends of such things and go on a cruise with his wife. And why? Because he feels a little depressed since his only daughter is gone to Peru on a Corps mission and will not be back for Christmas.<br />Of course, the people around the Krank house feel a little irritated that Krank would refuse to participate in the celebrations. But of course, they will all come together in the end because this is Christmas, a time of giving and a time of loving.<br />The book is very short and often funny. I found myself smiling more than once. This will not become a Christmas classic like A Christmas Carol or The Christmas Box, but it is still a fun read that I will want to come back to every year as Christmas comes closer and closer. Had the book been longer, than I might not have felt the same way. But coming in at a trim 177 pages, the story is a very quick and very entertaining read. A book that will surely put you in the Christmas spirit!	2001-11-23

The story is captivating, suspenseful and very entertaining. And it keeps you guessing until the very end. This is an amazing debut by a very talented author.<br />The book centers around a family torned by a tragic event. Twenty years ago, the young Fiona Airie disappeared during a neighbourhood party and was never found. Now, Pilot, the younger of the Airie boys, starts remembering things from his past. He has a psychological breakdown which will make his mind unravel. Dark family secrets will be uncovered and the lives of the Arie clan (which inclues the troubled mother who is loosing her vision and seeing ghosts, the father who moved moved away from his family after the tragic event, and the older brother Eric, a brilliant neurosurgeon) will change forever.<br />Things are even more affected when a young female psychologist sees Pilot and starts investigating the young man's past and his family.<br />The book is told from Pilot's point of view, but Pilot sees and hears everything. As he tells us, he is omniscient, which permits him to know everything that is going on even when he isn't present. This techinique of storytelling is very original and very affecting. It's as if Pilot himself becomes a ghost, always there, knowing everything.<br />The books is very suspenseful and affecting. You are drawn into the characters' lives and touched by their confusion and sandness. All these characters are so well drawn out that they feel real. Pilot is one of the most interesting and enigmatic characters I've encountered. This is a top-notch psychological thriller that always has you guessing. The story is intelligent and one-of-a-kind.<br />This books is just totally engrossing. Don't start it unless you intend on finishing it in one sitting.

These companions are ghosts and they will remain with her throughout her life to help her during times of hardship. They are always there to guide her into the right direction.<br />Whether it is love, family problems or just personal problems, the companions are always there to comfort her and to reassure her.<br />The tale is very sweet and touching. The only problem is that I wanted more. The books is short - barely 230 pages - and in it, you get a woman's entire life explained to you. But some of the moment's of Eva's life, moments which were very intersting, are too briefly explained. Maybe way too briefly. You find yourself wanting more, wanting to know more about her relationship with the companions and with her husband and daughter. I would have taken another 100 pages without problems!<br />I have to admit that this book took me by surprise. I wasn't planning on enjoying it this much. But once I finished reading the last page, I got this warm feeling withing me, a feeling of love for this story. Give this one a chance. It's the perfect holiday read!	2001-11-05

It is lyrical and has a very powerful poetic quality. As a matter of fact, the book reads like one long sad poem about loss and despair. This is the type of book that takes it time to tell its story. It is quiet and serene. <br />The books concentrates on two major characters. You have Anton, a German scientist who escaped his native land in the 40s and moved to America where he helped build the atomic bomb that would later destroy Hiroshima. Then you have Ekimo, a Japanese woman who's face was burnt by the bomb and who has lived in misery ever since. Both their lives are entwined in more ways than one as the book tries to show how much the war affected their existence. They are both still haunted by the horrors of that day. <br />The characters are highly believable and very well drawn out. The only problem is that the book sometimes tries to dig too deep into their lives. A lot of unnecessary back story is given in order to make these character seem more real. There is one long section where Anton looks at young kids playing in the snow which is very beautiful but which seems totally out of place in this book. It's as though Bock is trying too hard to give his characters a realistic back story.<br />The story is very similar to the styles of Michael Ondaatje or Alice Munro. But Bock still has to find the amazing power these two authors are able to convey through their prose. The Ash Garden is a good first novel, just not a perfect one.	2001-10-30

The story is original, different and one-of-kind. Brite created a new breed of vampires, creatures that can walk in the sun, creatures without real fangs, creatures who are exquisitely beautiful and strange all at once. These aren't the lyrical vampires one would find in an Anne Rice book; these are tormented souls who often act out of pure hatred and lust.<br />Brite has constructed a horror novel that is at once sexy, scary, graphic and disturbing. There are many great memorable moments in this novel, such as when one of the book's main character - a young boy named Nohting who has just learned that he is in fact a vampire - kills a friend of his because he is thirsting blood. And the book's finale is all at once engaging, thrilling and very sad.<br />Brite has also created two very amazing characters; Ghost is a young man who can read thoughts and who has mystical powers. And Nothing, the young boy with a tortured soul who longs for something better, who longs to be loved, is highly remarkable. <br />This gothic horror novel is sexy and scary, beautiful and ugly. It blends horror, mysticism, magic and lust in a very balanced way. You will find yourself unable to put the book down, and unwilling to let the characters go once you are done reading.	2001-10-25

Blood And Gold is the story of Marius, one of the oldest vampires in the Anne Rice mythology. He's been around since the early days of Rome and he was the creator of the vampires Pandora, Armand and Bianca. He was also the keeper of Enkil and Akasha, the King and Queen of Vampires.<br />Now, his very interesting story - which spands hundred of centuries - finds it's way to the page. I was very excited to get this book. After all, I wanted to read Marius's story in its entirety for so long! But the problem with the book is that we've seen most of this before. Marius has been a prominent character in many of Rice's books; from The Vampire Lestat to The Queen Of The Damned to Pandora to The Vampire Armand... Rice has already told us a lot about Marius in those novels. We already knew half of his story.<br />So we end up with Blood And Gold, a book which is half new and half repetition. Everything that happened in The Vampire Armand is retold through these pages. The book isn't very original. <br />And yet, Rice finds a way to enthrall the readers. Her poetic style of writing is as griping as ever and her tormented Marius is her most complex and interesting vampire after the beloved Lestat. The book does offer the reader many new exciting moments (such as Marius's encounter with Mael and the making of a young female vampire, as well as the destruction of an all-powerful female vampire). So overall, the book is very interesting and very entertaining. It's just too bad that it leaves you with this sense of deja vu.	2001-10-19

I only picked up Spiegelman's Maus because it was recommended to me by a friend. Never have I been so happy to follow someone's advice.<br />Maus is one of the most powerful and engaging war tale I've read thus far. It's very touching and emotional. A young men is interviewing his father in order to make a comic book out of his experience of being a Jew during the 2nd World War. We hear the father's story as he recalls how he hid with his wife during the war, how his wife's family was murdered, how his son was taken from him and then killed, how he was brought to a concentration camp and seperated from his wife to live in fear and misery.<br />The drawings are crude and simple. The jews are portrayed as being mice and the Germans are pigs. But the power behind the tale is the story itself. It is so touching that you cannot help but care for the story's characters. I never thought a comic book could be so engaging and so emotionally striking. This is one book that I'll come back to time and time again.	2001-10-18

On the one hand, the author's style is amazingly litterate and thoughtful; every word in the book feels carefully chosen in order to liberate the desired emotions/feelings upon the reader. On the other hand, this also creates a problem since Franzen seems to place more importance on the stylistics than on the plot and narrative.<br />What you end up with is a book with greatly defined characters but with very little substance. Here, the reader enouncters a family that is more disfunction than anything else. The parents are suffering; the mother is trapped between trying to keep her life the way it is why living with her Parkinson-and-dementia-afflicted husband. The children have all moved to different cities where they live empty, unhappy lives. As a matter of fact, no one seems to be happy in this book. Every time an event comes along which should make a character happy, this very character finds a way to complain his or her way through it. You never really identify with any of these characters because they seem to complain all the time. A little bit of happiness in their lives would not have killed them. But they all seem so closed up and distant that they refuse to let anything remotely happy enter their lives.<br />And yet, one has to admire the books for its style. Franzen's writing is beautiful and fulfilling. It's just too bad that this style isn't part of a more complete book, a book where plot and style do mesh together in complete harmony. This could have been a great American novel but it ends up feeling like a barely satisfying attempt.	2001-10-12

David Talbot, now a prominant vampire figure of the Vampire Chronicles, is brought back to Merrick, a Mayfair witch, because Louis wants Merrick to contact Claudia's ghost. Louis has been haunted by Claudia and he wants to make sure that she is happy, wherever she is.<br />This, of course, sets forth for some great historical horror like only Rice could write. The reason to read this book is that it tells us a lot about Talbot's past. Talbot has always been a mysterious character of which we didn't knew much. But this book sheds light on a lot of questions I had about this character. Plus, the book also introduces Merrick who will undoubtedly become a major figure in the series from now on. Merrick is a great character, one that Rice will have a lot of fun with in future novels. Finally, the book also holds some great romantic scenes between Merrick and Talbot, which only thickens the plot even more.<br />And finally, any fan of the Vampire Chronicles should read Merrick to know what happened to our beloved Claudia, the beautiful vampire child who was murdered in Interview With The Vampire. The end of the book is shocking, sad and very touching. <br />Merrick is some of Rice's best writing. It is her best book since Servants of The Bones, a great ride which any fan of Rice's work will not soon forget.	2001-10-04

If Chins Could Kill is not only a really funny and entertaining biography; it is also a very touching, well-thought read. You get a lot from this book, more than one would imagine to get from a so-called b movie actor.<br />Campbell goes through his entire career in this book, from the 8mm shorts he directed and acted in with pal Sam Raimi to the Evil Dead films to his hollywood bs right up to his role as actor/director in the tv series Xena and Hercules.<br />Of course, the best parts of the books are the ones where Campbell talks about his experience at shooting the Evil Dead flicks. Those parts area great as we really get to see how hard it is to make an independant film. If there is one person out there who is full of determination and guts, it's Campbell! The hell he went through to make those film is nearly unbelievable. But Bruce isn't shy to say what's really on his mind; and so this book is filled with good annecdotes and interesting tidbits about the ways of Hollywood (and he loves to tell us how much he hates Tom Arnold, which is always a plus!!!).<br />This is more than a tell-all book. Campbell has written that rare biography that is a lot more than a simple recollection of one's craft. And have I mentioned how hillarious the book is? Campbell is a great guy indeed. Anyone who enjoys films - especially b films for that matter - will love this book.	2001-10-02

It presents its reader with great, solid writing. Massie has a great style of her own and uses it fully to her advantage in this book. Unfortunately, the plot lacks credibility. It's hard to believe anything that happens in this book.<br />Here, we have a teacher who kidnaps one of her students because she wants to take her out of her home, where she is being abused by her father and mother. But they are both kidnapped by a troubled teen and they embark on a raod trip that will bring them from cold Virginia to warm Texas. The trip will be a real nightmare for all three women; darkness abounds and real dark twists of fate awaits them at every fork in the road. <br />The story in itself is marginally entertaining. But every time you think the story will drive away from the cliches of the road movie-type genre, the story takes a swerve and embraces those cliches with open arms. And these three women are so unrealistically unlucky and their lives are so full of demons that after a while, you just stop believing in their problems and troubled lives. I mean, how much problems can a person suffer through? <br />A story like this needs to leave the reader enthralled and needs to veer away from the cliches. Wire Mesh Mothers does nothing like that. If there is anything that it does do is show that Massie is a very good, solid writer. But that's pretty much it.	2001-09-29

I'll come out and say it right away: The Black House was a better book than its predecessor, The Talisman. Although I am a huge fan of The Talisman, I have to admit that Black House will probably go down in history, and it will be remembered as a masterpiece of horror. Because the book IS horrific, it IS amazingly well written and it IS totally engaging.<br />Black House takes us thirty years into the future. Jack does not remember what happened to him when he was twelve. He is a retired cop and is brought back to work when a killer who passes himself as The Fisherman starts acting up. The killer abducts and kills little children, just like some other notirious killer did in the 1920s. Coincidence? Of course not. And it's not a coincidence either that the killings are connected to the Territories.<br />The book takes the best of both authors. It is some of the best writing I've seen in a long time. Straub is amazing at creating serial killers that are believable and very scary. And he knows how to write compelling characters that are either detectives or cops. King is best when he writes wide-scope novels that cover large areas (ie, a whole town, like this book does) and many characters. He is a master at plotting suspense and delivering amazingly well drawn characters. So take the best of both authors, put them together and you have The Black House.<br />Plus, the book answers many, many questions about King's Dark Tower epic. Everything is connected in the King World, this book included. <br />Black House is an amazing read. And there are some nail-biting sequences (two scenes gave me the creeps like no other horror book has in the last ten years). This one is a keeper! It is a great read and a very intelligent book.	2001-09-24

It takes the entire process of making a film and analyzes it step by step. Lumet is a wonderful filmmaker who is a master of the craft; reading this book is like assisting to a lecture given by one of Hollywood's finest.<br />Lumet takes every single film he has ever done and talks about them from every point of view possible; lighting, directing, acting, editing, sound, score... Every aspect of filmmaking is touched upon and explained in explicit details for the reader. Lumet leaves nothing out. Although he can at times seem a little pretentious, his writing is top-notch and his intelligence always welcomed. This book really gives you an idea of all the work that goes behind the making of a film and it is a book that any young filmmaker - or anyone who loves movies for that matter - should read.	2001-09-24

Here, you have an ex-soldier who is now a government worker, who is hired to find two traitous soldiers who disappeared during the Viet-Nam War. After finding some bones which are quickly linked to these two missing solidiers, a manhunt begins, a hunt will which take the main characters all across the world from Asia to Hawaii to Russia to Australia. <br />The book is very powerful and great at invoking the ways of life of the Japanese. It is also heart-wrenching in its representation of the post Viet-Nam War life in Asia. <br />I'm not usually big on war novels, but Lost Soldiers really got to me. It is beautiful, lyric and very poetic. The characters are highly realistic and likeable. The author brings you into their lives and mixes their battle with their own personal demons with the manuhunt which is at the heart of the plot.<br />Asian life is beautifully invoked and representated in this novel. The story is suspenseful and very entertaining. This is a very intersting read and a book that you will not soon forget.	2001-09-13

He knows every book, novella, short story and essay the man has written in and out. There isn't one work he isn't totally familiar with. I actually wonder if he knows more about King's writing than King does himself.<br />In The Essential Stephen King, Spignesi tries to rank the 101 best things king has ever written. And although every major King work is featured (all of the novels are there, so are the novellas), many of King's best short stories didn't make the cut (where are The Night Flyer and Lawnmower Man?). And I was disappointed when I saw some of my favorite King novels ranked so high up the list (Dolores Claiborne, The Dark Half, Needful Things and Storm Of the Century aren't even near the top 10!). Of course, this is a fan ranking his favourite works. No two fans will think alike.<br />The reason the book is so powerful is because of the author's writing skills. Spignesi writes with passion and dedication. Every sentence is like a love confession for the King of horror. And I also enjoyed the articles written by King fans/experts at the end of the book. This books makes you want to revisit King's best writings. It's a book every King fan will enjoy and will use time and time again as a reference manual.	2001-09-03

Some of these stories are classic Gaiman (see list below); they are dark, funny and very ironic all at once. Unfortunately, too mamny of the stories in this collection lack the wit and cynicism that makes Gaiman such a unique writer. <br />As a matter of fact, some of the stories feel a little dry, as if Gaiman wrote them without really wanting too. And I found myself skipping through some of the poems; Gaiman is great at writing prose and he should stick to what he's good at.<br />Still, this collection offers many great stories. Don't miss Troll Bridge, Looking for The Girl, We Can Get Them For You Wholesale, Tastings, Murder Mysteries, One Life Furnished in Early Moorcock and especially Snow, Glass, Apples, a fun, twisted vampire story.	2001-08-22

It is so off-the-wall and unique that it does not fit into one single category/genre.<br />The book is about a group of junketeers who go to a small town for the unveiling of a stamp featuring local hero John Henry, a railroad man who was able to beat a steal-planting machine on a one-on-one competition. The book mixes legendary facts with Whitehead's present-day fictional story. But the book also includes many long, unecessary chapters about how the legend and John Henry himself have influenced people over the years. These chapters feel totally out of place; they feel more like space fillers than anything else. <br />The book is a bit overlong and Whitehead often gets lost in his own narratives (his sentences can run on for paragraphs!), although his style of writing is very unique and always poetic. All in all, the John Henry Days is a very intersting, very unique, very intelligent read. It's just not something you'll want to read over and over again.	2001-08-20

He is a so-called horror novelist who blends natural, every-day horror (the darkness of a person's mind is always prominent in his books) with great stories. Now comes The Lost, his most mature and most affecting since Girl Next Door.<br />A melee of characters in 1969 are trying to cope with something horrible that happened five years ago; the cold-blooded murder of two young female campers. You have the murderer, Ray, his two accomplices, Jen and Tim, some of their friends, the cop on the case, Charlie, and a retired cop who helped Charlie with the case five years ago, Ed. All their lives are about to crumble together as the horrors of the past event resurface to haunt them once more. Ketchum has no remorse for any of these characters; he shows to us that no one, no matter how good, is safe from a twisted mind. <br />Ketchum is at his affecting best with this book. His prose grabs you by the guts and never intends to let go of you until the final page. The regular Ketchum reader will recognize all the trademarks that made this author such a cult phenomenon. But new readers beware; this tale is more slow moving and nostalgic than his other books (a lot of the book was obviously inspired by old 60s music, rock icons and films). Still, with its bloody finally and believable characters, The Lost is Ketchum's best in years, and that's saying a lot!	2001-08-11

The Manhattan Hunt Club is a very good summer read; it's the kind of book that reads itself quickly and which you can't help but find entertaining. <br />The plot is simple in itself; a society of rich, high-class socialites have developed the ulitmate game. They send prisoners down the subway tunnel systems where they hunt them to death. Our main hero, Jeff, becomes a huntee but, of course, he isn't guilty of the crimes he is accused of. He needs to run away from the hunters and survive their attacks. Mix to this about half a dozen more characters, including a female politician, Jeff's father and mother, Jeff's girlfriend and Jinx, a young girl who lives in the tunnels and you get a book that is very full. Maybe even a little too full.<br />Sure, the tale moves along quickly and it is very suspenseful, but stopping at just a little over 300 pages, the book never gives you the satisfaction of truly knowing any of the characters. Saul spends too much time on suspense and not enough time developing the characters. Hence, you end up not really caring for any of them.<br />Still, the book offers some great moment and the 75-pages finale is pretty great. This is a good summer read. It's classic Saul, but it's not Saul at his best.	2001-08-05

You get a great coming-of-age epic novel about one boy's discovery of adulthood. <br />Jack is on a mission; he must find a hotel that holds a power source which will enable him to save his dying mother. But things aren't that simple; there are parallel worlds in the universe and Jack has to jump from one world to the next in order to reach the black hotel. In these worlds, he encounters friends as well as dangerous enemies. He will be face with horrible situations and he will be put on the verge of death many times. Furthermore, he must be careful to stay out of his uncle's way, the very man who is trying to catch him and kill him.<br />The book is incredibly well thought, full of beautiful imagery and always compelling. This is a great fantasy/drama that is always surprising and never predictable. Straub and King have written one of the best novel of the 1900s. Let's just hope that the sequel will live up to our expectations!	2001-08-03

I await her books with impatience and I love to revel in her older stories (I cannot count how many times I have read Interview). I love to go back to Lestat's stories, how he came to be, what has happened to him. The Queen Of The Damned picks up where The Vampire Lestat left us and the book is a joyride into vampire and Egyptian mythology, as well as in eroticsm and darkness.<br />The Queen of The Damned as awakend and she is killing off all of the earth's vampires, save for Lestat's covent. She has a purpose; to get rid of the men of the earth in order to find peace in the world. She wants to destroy violence and create a pure world which she will rule. She kidnaps Lestat in the hopes that he will join her in her quest.<br />The tale spirals from every corners of the world, going from mythic Egypt to today's modern rock-scene world. Anne Rice brings the stake to a whole new level with this book; although I just can't imagine how they will turn this story into a movie. There are so many wonderful characters (old ones like Louis, Arman and Marius as well as new ones like Jesse, David and Khayman) and Rice's narritive style is so poingnant that this is one book you will not want to see end.<br />Anne Rice has reinvented the mythology behind the idea of vampires with this book. She gives them a new origin and a new form, and I quite enjoyed her vision. No one writes vampire literature like Anne Rice does. This is one book that you will keep coming back to time and time again.	2001-08-01

It's so full of ideas and radical thoughts that you can't help but feel amazed. This is one book that dares to look at what is wrong with our society (of course, all of it done under the form of a satire) and it tries to show us how these 'wrong' things affect our every day life to the utter most degree.<br />Here, you have a young man who becomes a sensational celebrity. He is the only survivor of a cult where all its members killed themselves. Now, after a lot of work from publicists and agents (makeovers, a new history, endorsements and so on...), he becomes a national religious leader. But it all comes crumbling down quickly enough because, like everything in this world, he too quickly becomes something of the past, something outdated.<br />After writing the so-so Fight Club, Palahniuk has outdone himself with this social satire. The books show us perfectly how we tend to like on thing one day and something else the next. It shows us how we love to idolize criminals and how we need to let others give our life meaning. We are all a manufactured product of society; everything we say, think, see has been manufactured by groups of people who are paid to invent the society we live in. As shocking and thought-provoking as this is, this is exactly what Survivor shows us. This book is intelligent, funny and very inventive. In one word, this book is an eye opener!	2001-07-24

I usually love his books, as they are very dark and atmospheric. But The Long Walk wins it! This one is King's darkest novel. It's about a group of boys who, in a near future, participate in a race where the losers are killed. These 100 boys walk together for 4 days, discussing their non-existant future and death. This, of course, makes for a very bleak read.<br />The book is short but it still felt a little repetitive to me. Sure, this is about a group of boys doing the walk (not much to do except, well, than to walk!), but it seems that King doesn't have enough to sustain the reader's attention for 350 fifty pages. As a matter of fact, the beginning of the book feels more like a short story than a novel. Did King start this one as a short story? It sure does feel like it.<br />Still, this book is exciting in that King demonstrates how wonderful he is at writing dialogue. Everything these boys say feel true and real. You can't help but care about all these characters, even the so-called mean ones. This isn't the great King at work, but it's still a very good read nonetheless!	2001-07-20

I picked up this book because friends recommended it to me. And, now that I've just finished reading the book, I am amazed at how powerful it really was. It is an epic story about the human heart and the human condition.<br />The Poisonwood Bible tells the story of family of missionaries that leaves America to go change the world of the Congo in 1959. The father, a religious fanatic, puts his beliefs before his family, something that will become highly fatal both for him and his family (his wife and four daughters). As their lives becomes entwined with the political situation of the Congo as well as with the lives and beliefs of the natives, their souls become drenched with despair and desire to return to their homeland.<br />So it comes as a surprise to see the decisions these women make when they grow up and try to deal with the teachings of the Congo. The book spans over four decades, starting in 1959 and ending today, told from the point of view of the daughters of the mission priest. These girls are as different as night and day; the author gives each of them a very specific voice and tone. <br />I have to admit that it takes time to get into the narrative (it took me about a 100 pages to really get into the book) and that the book does run on for a little too long near the end. But overall, The Poinsonwood Bible is an amazing book about the power of life. It tries to tell us that what we learn in life is invaluable and that we are each our very own individual that is defined by what we learn through our life experiences.	2001-07-15

Now, in the book The Stephen King Universe, three talented authors have collected all of King's work and have tried to show the link that ties them to one another.<br />The book is great as a reference manual on King's novel and stories. Every book receives a brief synopsis with a description of the major characters as well as a film synopsis/analysis if it applies. <br />Unfortunately, the book does have a few errors (like saying the the Black house - the next Talisman book - is actually the next Dark Tower Novel) but the book is mostly complete in describing the ties and links between the novels and films.  Anyone who wants to learn more about the amazing world King has created should get this book. I enjoyed reading it and I'll keep it close whenever I'm reading a King novel.	2001-07-07

It ranks up there with the story The Body by Stephen King (which was turned into the great movie Stand By Me). I bought October Sky after seeing the film, which I just loved. Now that I've read the book, I've grown to appreciate this coming of age tale even more (although, surprisingly enough, the movie did remain faithful to the book).<br />This is the story of Homer Hickam, a high school boys who dreams of a life outside of the small mining town of Coalwood, where things have always been the same and where only the school's football players get any recognition. But all that is about to change. When Homer becomes enthralled with Sputnik, he wonders what it would take for him to build a rocket. From that moment on, Homer embarks on a self-searching mission where he will learn to attain his true potential.<br />This is a book which I'll come back too often. After reading the last page, you just feel sorry and sad because you now have to leave all those great people behind. Hickam was able to recreate his past which an incredible realism and sense of truth. You believe every word mentioned in this book. You start to feel like you've known these characters all your life. Hickam is a greatly talented author. I can't wait to read his other books!	2001-07-06

He works in every genre and everything he writes is amazing and brilliant. Summer Of Night is one of the best horror novels ever written and the Hyperion series is just breathtaking. Now, Simmons is trying his hands at the criminal, pot-boiler ficiton, and he succeeds at it amazingly well.<br />Hardcase is a quick, fast read about mistaken identities and coincidences. It reminded me of the early works of Elmore Leonard. The book is as brilliant as Leonard's best. It is fast paced, violent and extremely funny. I never thought Simmons could be so sarcastically comic!<br />All in all, Hardcase is a welcomed departure from a writer who is underrated and who deserves much more praise and fame than he is getting. Don't let this one pass you by! It's a guaranteed fun read, especially now that the beaches are open and reading out in the sun seems to be on everyone's mind.

I have to admit that I picked up this book because the author is the sister of one of my fave authors, Anne Rice. And, although their stories can feel similar at times (both work with historical ficiton mixed in with dark fantasy and/or horror), it often feels like Borchardt tries too hard to imitate her sister's unique, poetic style of writing.<br />The Silver Wolf is a very frustrating read. Every time I felt the book was getting somewhere, every time the story started getting interesting, then the rug would be pulled from under my feet as the story would stall into place for twenty or thirty pages. The book is more than 450 pages long, but this story could have easily been told in less than 300 pages.<br />Regeane is a woman/wolf who is promised for marriage to a warrior she does not know. She has a fear of men and her marriage, she is told, is the one thing which has the potential power of saving a crumbling Rome. Sure, that sounds like great stuff, but when Borchardt goes into historical detailing, she fails to remember that she is writing a story here. Too often, she forgets about the plot to tell us unnecessary stuff about Rome, stuff that she could have hinted at instead of blantantly displaying in her prose (on the other hand, Anne Rice is able to tell us a lot about a historical time through her prose and characters instead of through long, harduous and unnecessary paragraphs).<br />Overall, I cannot recommend Silver Wolf. I found the book hihghly disappointing and not very interesting. Too bad, because I had a lot of hopes for this book. This just wasn't my cup of tea!	2001-06-28

It's not enough that this family lives through everyday coldness and separation. A very disturbing act of violence is about to fall upon them and shatter their lives forever.<br />I bought The Trap because Tabitha King is Stephen King's wife. I knew her style and genre opposed her husband's, but never did I thought that she would be such a beautifully skilled author. King takes her time to write her prose; her beautiful and usually long sentences create a narrative yearning that one can't help but admire. The story is slow moving, but that's the brilliance behind the book. Once that horrible act happens more than halfway through the book, it takes you by total surprise.<br />Her characters are strong and very distinct; unlike most ficiton, her characters feel real and believable. So once the shocking event occurs more than halfway through the book, you can't help but feel sorry for the characters that are involved. You just want to leap into the page and give them a hand.<br />King takes her time writing her prose, something that the typical thrill-a-minute seeker will not be able to appreciate. But The Trap is a very important work that affects its readers on many, many levels. It's a hard and complicated story to read, but it's compelling in that it is able to evoke emotions in the reader that most authors can only dream of touching. I can't wait to read more from this terrific author.	2001-06-16

It is a novel that mixes witchcraft and zombies, horror and romance without shame. The first half of the book is amazing and intriguing. Two stories are being told; the first takes place in the modern period, where an investigator is given a case that includes strange deaths and disappearence and dead bodies that keep on walking. The second story takes place in the 1800s as a witch community is founded and, of course, things start going wrong. Slowly, the two stories interconnect and become one.<br />I loved the first part of the book. I just couldn't put it down. The only problem is that there might have been too many characters, but that was just a minor problem. You start caring for Miles, the main character, early on in the story. His character is very well define, much more than your average horror book. <br />Unfortunately, the book lost me in its last 50 pages, as it becomes way over-the-top and too unbelievable. But then again, that's a problem with most Bentley Little books. He puts way too much at the end. So instead of being a good, thrilling finale, you get all the blood and guts that can fit within 50 pages. After a while, too much is too much.<br />But overall, The Walking is a great beach book that is easy to read. There are many very frightening moments in the book and the story is always intriguing. So overall, a good effort which is somewhat undermined by its ending.	2001-05-27

In 1916, a sole white shark terrorized the coast of New Jersy and New York as it made its way down, attacking humans as it went. The novel is very well written, although author Capuzzo gives us too much information that is irrelevant. For example, he gives us the background and history of a hotel and of people that have nothing to do with the actual events. They just serve as space fillers.<br />But Cappuzzo's straightforward style is impressive. He is able to create suspense by reenacting the events of that Summer. I loved the parts that are more or less from the shark's point of view. Every time the shark is close to attacking someone, the book's suspense level becomes incredible. <br />Overall, Close To Shore is a fun read that has a lot of pertinent information about sharks. It's unfortunate that the author felt the need to distract us with too much details or too much character background. This book could have been perfect, but it ends up simply being a fun beach book (just be careful which beach you read it on!).	2001-05-21

After writing the amazing series, The Diaries Of the Family Dracul, Kalogridis presents to us (after a very, very long absence) with this wonderful tale of witchcraft set in 14th Century France.<br />It is the period of the Inquisition, when cardinals would burn so-called witches at the stake (hence, the title of the book). In the first few pages, a witch named Sybill is arrested by the Cardinal's army under the charges of witchcraft. She is brought to prison and then will be tortured until a young priest, who will eventually take her confession, comes and puts a stop to the torture.<br />The priest is Michel, a young man who is only undergoing his second Inquisition. But this time, the stakes are higher. The Cardinal wants this woman to be found guilty, and Michel's honor is in peril since he believes that this woman might actually be a saint, not a witch.<br />Most of the book is written under the form of a confession, reminiscent of Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire and The Witching Hour. The form serves the story well; Michel and Sybill are intertwined through a very powerful, very touching narrative that never ceased to amaze me. <br />The Burning Times is a very intelligent novel, coming from a very gifted author. I hope that Kalogridis's next book will come quicker, because this book only made me yearn for more. This is a great fictionous tale of 14th Century France, but one that rings true nonetheless. This book reads like Anne Rice at her best, maybe even better. <br />The Burning Times is one of the year's most compelling reads. Don't miss out on it!	2001-05-18
US	49059365	R1ORYKPKJHFVIF	0843947667	187446020	Mischief	Books	2	5	8	N	N	Been there, done that	For the first time, I picked up a Douglas Clegg novel. I've heard great things about this guy so I was curious. But based on this novel, I have to admit that I was really disappointed.<br />The story revolves around an old school that has a dark past. We have a young boy going to this school (the boy also has a dark past) and slowly, strange things start happening to him. <br />That's pretty much it. The story has been told a million times, and much better (if you want a great book about a haunted school, read Dan Simmon's Summer Of Night, one of the best horror books ever written). It doesn't help that Clegg doesn't really have a style. His writing in primitive and boring. This reads more like a young-adult novel than a full, fleshed out horror novel.<br />I will not give up on Clegg just yet, but this story just didn't cut it for me. In a horror book, I look for something different, something that will be able to grab me by the throat from the very first page on. I want something that will bring me on a wild and strange ride. Mischief did none of that. The story is predictable and not very original. <br />Fortunately, this one's a quick read. If you're looking for something as a quick fix in between books, than this could be a good one. But if you're looking to be blown away or if you're looking for something more than a very unoriginal tale of ghosts and spirits, than skip this one. It didn't do it for me and it won't do it for you either.	2001-05-06

Golman goes into great lengths to describe how Hollywood works and how writing a script for Hollywood works.<br />As examples, Goldman uses his own scripts (The Princess Bride, Misery), analyzing them, telling us the problems he had while writing them and giving us his honest opinion about the final script and the final film product. Goldman also analyzes what he believes to be some of the best film sequences of all time, telling us why they work so well and why they are so brilliant (he uses scenes from There's Something About Mary, Chinatown, Fargo and his very own Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Film).<br />Unfortunately, the book loses momentum in its last part. Here, Goldman has written a short script and tries to show us how he develops his ideas while writing a screenplay. He also asked some of his friends from the business to peer-analyze the script. This section doesn't bring us much insight and is, quite frankly, a bore.<br />The book's better moments come when Goldman tells us where he finds his ideas and how these ideas become stories. I love the section in which he describes the process he goes through when adapting a book for the screen (using his scripts for Misery and Absolute Power).<br />Overall, this is a very interesting, often funny, usually informative look on the screen trade and the art of screenwriting. Anyone who wants to learn a bit more about the subject should start with this book. Just be warned that you won't find a great deal of elightenment here.	2001-05-05
US	49059365	R260H65GG6CWUZ	0688163165	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Soulful Mystery	I had never read a Dennis Lehane book. I picked up this one after reading a review in EW that praised the book as one of the best of the year. I didn't know what to expect, I didn't have any preconseptions about the author.<br />I started the book a few days ago and I just couldn't put it down! I understand that Lehane is a crime/mystery novelist, but Mysitic River is much more than that. This is a mystery novel that has a soul. It has an emotional denisity that we rarely find in novels of this genre. It grabs you by the gut from the very first page and only lets go of you on the final page.<br />In Mystic River, you have three childhood friends who are reunited by the gruesome murder of a young woman. Something horrible happened to one of them when they were younger, and the shadows of that event still haunt them.<br />As the murder investigation, progresses, the three friends become entertwined, but not always in the ways you'd expect. One of them becomes the prime suspect, the other is the father of the deceased and the last is the cop who is doing the investigation.<br />Rarely have I seen characters so fully fleshed out and realistic. It's like you've known these people all your life. They breathe, think and act like we would. Their dialogue is sharp and realistic and - and this is probably the book's best asset - simplistic. Rarely do I read a book where EVERY single character feels real and three-dimensional.<br />This is one book you won't be able to put down. You'll want to read it from cover to cover in one sitting. Lehane created a wonderful work of fiction which is dramatic, suspenseful and mysterious all at once. Mystic River will end up on many best of year-end list for 2001, so don't miss out on this wonderful, amazing book!	2001-05-02
US	49059365	R3PT75VGZGZ7HZ	0671040596	666522577	Deviant Ways	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Passable fun ride	Chri Mooney's Deviant Ways isn't a masterpiece of suspense. It is an awkwardly written book which is able to grab you by the gut once in a while and take you on a very wild ride. But the book is so far-fetched at times, and the dozens of characters that graze the pages of this book are so badly desinged they all end up looking and sounding alike.<br />I have to admit that the more I read, the more I got into the story. But at one point in the book (about halfway through), you just have to let all your disbeliefs go in order to enjoy the ride. Jack, our main character, is trying to save a woman which is trapped in a car filled with explosives. Oh yeah, and the madman killer is controlling the car. Jack rides on top of cars, doing the super hero things, and ends up surviving AND without a single scratch. Plus, the madman is following them in his car, so how can he drive AND control the other woman's car all at once?<br />There are many things in this book that you just can't believe. And the dialogue is often horrendous. But if you're able to let go of your sense of logic, then the book becomes enjoyable. I particularly liked the climactic - if overwritten -  ending and there is one scene involving a bomb, a young boy and a pool which is just amazing. But the rest of the book is average at most.<br />This book was written to be turned into a film, there is no doubt about it. The paper-thin characters and short chapters are crying to be adpted into a film. And this whole book, with a little retooling and rewritting, could become a great action flick. But on the page, the whole drama doesn't play as well as it could. First time author Mooney should try to develop a style instead of trying to figure out how to bring upon the next blow-up.<br />One last thing... Mooney seems to love silly similes. So many chapters begin with very childish and unnecessary descriptions of the sky. After a while, you just feel like screaming, &quot;No more!&quot;	2001-04-25
US	49059365	RNKS9AV03S996	1887368353	292687471	Ladies Night	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Great, Fun, Read	Ladies' Night is quite a departure for Jack Ketchum. The book's intro tells us that he wrote this book in the early 80s and worked on it ever since. And now, the final results has been published. And it looks a lot like an Urban-city version of Night Of the Living Dead. In this book, a strange chemical is realeased in New York city and every single woman becomes a zombie-like creature who is thirsty for blood. And so they go after the men.<br />The book is fun, gory and fast-paced. It is a quick read. It made me grin quite a lot. I love Ketchum's ironic style. He loves to play with words, giving many words or sentences double meanings. And he is not afraid to shock his readers. This book isn't for the faint of heart.<br />Ketchum fans should find this to be a fun read. It's not Ketchum's best, but it's still a Ketchum book.	2001-03-23
