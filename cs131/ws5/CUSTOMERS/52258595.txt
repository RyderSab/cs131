I was hooked from the first, intrigued by the characters, human, reptile and the swamp itself, as much as by the mystery.  I'm embarrassed to say that I was almost two thirds through the first chapter before I realized that it was written in first person, something I tend to avoid as few writers can pull it off well.  Alam has jumped to my must-buy list and I'm on my way to get the second in the series right now.  If you love well rounded characterization as well as a engrossing story, buy this book.  You won't be disappointed!	2005-09-27

Plus, I admit to a weakness for Victor Cachat, so this book was a wonderful surprise.  New characters that I have come to love plus others that have grown over the years.

However, I'm not certain that I would recommend it to something just starting to read in the Honorverse.  This is much deeper and political than action orientated, yet just as engrossing.  Catching up with the various people in the Mantie and Peep worlds was wonderful, but with the addition of the Sollies, Andies, and Sillies, I keep going &quot;now, who are they with again?&quot;  What was really creepy was that I was reading this while listening to the news and hearing almost exactly the same type of situation on both, just narrowed down to one planet.  Politicians pontificating, wars on the verge, boats pulled over when too near the wrong country...decent people trying to win despite the efforts of the crooked.  Weber may be getting too realistic for his own good.  I must commend Baen for the CD-Rom included with the book.  The art alone was worth the look, but to have the entire series of books at my computer fingertips?  Exquisite!	2002-11-10

I definitely recommend reading in these books in order, to understand the backgrounds of the characters and see their continuing development.<br />I haven't been so hooked on a series since the Honor Harrington series in Science Fiction and the 87th Precinct in Mysteries.

This is a hard book to find, no longer in print, but is worth the search.  Try your local library, that's where I found it.

No sexual hijinks, but a satisfying read, filled with Neels' exquisite use of language and vibrant descriptions.  One of the best writers in the old, but still popular subgenre of sweet romance.  She never fails to elicite a deep sigh of content from me and is a nice change from the intensity of my other favorites, such as Diana Palmer.	2000-10-01

After 48 hours alone in an alien cave, Lydia Smith has found her life and career ruined.  She is struggling to make a comeback while working in a low-rate museum.  Just as she gets a client for private investigation, she finds a ruin rat friend dead at the museum.  Soon she and her client, former Guild head Emmett London, are knee deep in danger as they search for Emmett's nephew and the murderer.  In between, Lydia must deal with her resentment of ghost hunters and Guild members, past and present.<br />This is not a stand alone book.  You must read ORCHID, AMARYLLIS, and ZINNIA first.  If you don't, you may be lost in the details of Harmony.  However, I am surprised at the viciousness of some of the reviews.  Most successful romance authors have a common theme in their books.  It makes the reader comfortable.  The way the author makes each book new and somehow different is what keeps us coming back.  Diana Palmer, Jayne Ann Krentz, Betty Neels, they all have common themes/storylines in their books.  I found AFTER DARK to be a lovely tale of life in Harmony.  Okay, it is like &quot;Seattle in 2000&quot;.  So what?  That makes it familiar.  As the experts say, fashions come in cycles.  Would I recommend this book to a new reader of Castle?  No, they must start at the beginning.  Would I say to a fan to buy it?  Yes, I would.  It might not have been as good as the previous three, but it was still a lovely tale of a bullheaded hero and a stubborn heroine.	2000-10-01

Cordelia Courtenay's mother had died after years of going from country to  country, lover to lover, dragging her daughter with her.  When her mother's  Turkish pasha lover wants Cordelia as a replacement, Cordelia knows she  must flee.  She sells her mother's jewelry to Aaron ben Joseph who helps  her with the escape plans.  He also sends his cousin, James Preston, to  accompany Cordelia.  Preston needs to leave Turkey immediately.<br />This is  not your typical Regency romance, nor is it a &quot;sheikh&quot; story as  noted in an auction listing.  It is a tale of adventure, not manners, no  &quot;wham-bam&quot; romance, just a gradual &quot;getting to know  you&quot;.  If you like multilayered storytelling, adventure and travel,  wonderful characterization, this is the book for you.  The characterization  of the various cultures is fair and complete.  There are good guys and bad  guys amongst all types of people.  If you want a bit of fluff, filled with  fashion, dances and witty repartee, SCANDAL'S DAUGHTER isn't for you.   Instead, read some of Dunn's earlier works.  This is fine writing at its  best.  Enjoy!	2000-09-17

The kitten belongs to Felix's aunt, a woman who is convinced  Felix is a warlock, she is a witch, and the cat is the reincarnation of  Felix's late father.  Too short a story, there is barely time for Gilly and  Felix to fall in love.  The cat's role was too small, a complaint I had  about the remaining two stories.<br />&quot;The Black Kitten&quot; by  Catherine Blair.  Lord Jonathan Griffith was so eager to get his hands on  the Harrington Egyptian collection that he was willing to woo Lorna  Harrington, the daughter.  She was testy, thought of as a witch, and had  turned down 14 previous suitors.  Griffith had even bet a friend one  hundred pounds that Lorna would be engaged by All Hallows' Eve.  He never  expected to be attracted to her or to learn how lonely Lorna was, living  with only her cats for companions when her selfish father travelled the  world.  Lorna and Jonathan are two lonely people who need each other.  The  cats' roles are small, but essential.<br />&quot;A Cat by Any Other Name&quot;  by Joy Reed.  Miranda Strong knew she was destined to be a spinster, but to  be given the spinster's usual companion, a kitten, was mortifying.

Then Brian appears on her doorstep, alive and  ready to continue with his life and his marriage.  Kim is a different  person, can she choose between her new life and her first love, father of  her children?<br />Engrossing, an emotional storm that tears into your heart.   Extremely deep for a series romance.  However, Brian was at times a very  unlikeable hero.  He came back and spent months with his parents, writing a  book, without calling his wife.  He spent time before that in military  hospitals being checked physically and mentally, again refusing to contact  his wife or allowing the military to call her.  He slept with other women,  while knowing he was still married, yet condemns Kim for moving into a new  relationship while believing she was a widow.  He talks and writes about  his experiences with strangers, but refuses to talk to his wife.  Brian is  a bit immature, but this does not detract from the story.

After the marriage, Pru works on reuniting Case with his family and  clearing up the mystery surrounding the death of Case's fiance.<br />I've  always liked when the heroine defends the hero without knowing the whole  story.  This is one of those books.  Pru is wonderful and Case is truly  appreciative.  While his family should've known Case better than to believe  the story told, it was a deathbed statement, taken far too seriously in  most cultures.  I, for one, believe that marriage should be for each adult  involved, not for the sake of the child.  The child suffers when the  parents are together only for them, believe me.	2000-08-27

The couple must learn to accept each  other while trying to clear Augusta's dead brother's honor and searching  for a dangerous enemy spy.<br />Lovely tale, but a bit weaker than most Quick  novels.  Augusta kept going on and on about her family traits for  recklessness and stubborness.  It got a bit old before long.  The ladies  club, Pompeia, was a wonderful touch.

An injury during her childhood stripped Lady Lillian Walford's vocal cords until the only sounds she could make were harsh and painful.  Her  reclusive, loving brother blackmails Anthony Harbreas, Earl of Graydon,  into escorting Lily about London during her Season.  Although nearly  engaged to another woman, Graydon falls in love with Lily and uses a  kidnapping setup organized by her brother to convince her to marry him.  In  an effort to shield Lily from malicious gossip, Graydon doesn't bring her  back with him to London after the Christmas holiday, convincing Lily that  he is ashamed of her.  Secondary romances between Lily's brother and her  aunt, forbidden by British law, and a fiery courtship between Lily's cousin  and Graydon's best friend are threaded throughout the book.<br />Magnificent  story with well-developed characters and views on how mutes and deaf-mutes  were treated by Society.  Highly recommended to historical and regency  romance fans, particularly those who like a little depth to their romances.	2000-08-06

When Prince Stephan Reynard of Castile arrived in Willoughby, Texas, to  retrieve his nephew, heir to the throne, he never expected to meet a Texas  wildcat.  Mandy Crawford was the adopted mother of the child in question,  determined to save young Josh from the cold upbringing his father had  endured.  As Stephen and Mandy struggle to work out a solution, they fight  a strong personal attraction.<br />If you can ignore the fact that the ruling  family would have sent lawyers to handle this situation, not the current  heir, you may like this story.

Imogen Waterstone needed help to destroy the man she believed murdered her best friend, the man who participated in her social ruin.  Who better than Matthias Marshall, Earl of Colchester, the man who discovered the lost  island of Zamar?  Imogen decides that Matthias is not the man of action she  assumed he would be, that in fact, he is subject to nerves.  No matter what  his reputation or what others say about him, Imogen will not believe  anything bad about Matthias.  Bemused, Colchester finds his match in the  strong-willed, unpredictable Imogen.<br />The thing that most attracts me to  Amanda Quick books are the strange and wonderful heroines.  They discount  anything bad about the hero and, ultimately, lead him like a dangerous  panther on a leash.  Then there is the witty repartee.  Exquisite and  delightfully humorous.	2000-07-30

Sonnie Keith Giacano didn't remember much of the accident that killed her unborn daughter and put her in the hospital, only what people told her.  And what she dreamed or imagined.  According to her overbearing  half-sister, Billy, she needs help.  Her brother-in-law, Romano Giacano has  also hinted that Sonnie would be better off with him.   All Sonnie knows is  that her husband was supposedly kidnapped eight months earlier, causing  Sonnie to drive her car at high speeds, hitting a wall on the beach road.  No ransom was ever received.  Desperate to find out the truth, Sonnie  returns to Key West and demands the assistance of burned-out ex-cop Christ  Talon.  As danger mounts, so does the sexual tension between Chris and  Sonnie.<br />Cameron has crafted an enthralling read that keeps you guessing  to the very last chapters.  Not about the enemies Sonnie has, but about her  mental state, about the cause of her near fatal accident, and about her  missing husband.  And, despite the reviewers who would prefer to miss the  mushy stuff, the romantic suspense is an important part of the story.	2000-07-30

When obnoxious male members of her class are murdered, Harry must delve into old memories and scandalous rumors to  discover the murderer.  On a personal front, Fair declares his intent to  aggressively win Harry back; Harry learns to get past Fair and BoomBoom's  betrayal; Miranda feels young again when an old flame, Tracy Raz, comes to  town for their 50th reunion, rooming with Harry and helping around the  farm; and Market is looking for love among the single women in town.<br />The  people in Crozet attract me to these books even more then the mysteries do.   I would wish that Brown wouldn't make killers out of some of the most  likeable people, but some real-life killers were very charming.  Just look  at Ted Bundy.  I felt sorry for the killer.  Although murder wasn't a  proper revenge, it was all too understandable considering the  circumstances.  The animals' actions were much more realistic than in CAT  ON THE SCENT, the last Mrs. Murphy mystery, thank heavens.  Okay, a cat  coauthor isn't &quot;realistic&quot; either, but cats driving cars was  beyond my capacity to accept.	2000-07-23

This book is suspense.  While there is some romance, it is not  romantic suspense (the emphasis is on the mystery, not the romance).  It is  better than THE EDGE, but it is obvious that Coulter is going mainstream,  with more bulk and less romance.  The characterization is up to Coulter's  usual high standards, and we see old friends Sherlock and Savich again.  I  see a new readership for Catherine Coulter in the mystery/suspense genre,  but I will miss her romantic fiction.	2000-07-16

A visit with the Montgomerys and their extended  family is always a pleasure, but to have a plus-size heroine who is admired  by the hero is wonderful.  Having her lose weight seemed silly and wrong.<br /><br />UPDATED FROM REREAD Aug 2011.<br /><br />Based on the recent news of Jude Deveraux being scammed out of twenty million dollars, I felt like I should revisit one of her older books.  I chose Wishes as I remember being pleased with the idea of a plus-sized heroine who got her man while heavy, not after losing her excess weight.

Jace Montgomery, finally recovering from his wife's death in childbirth, has come to town to visit cousin Kane Taggert and his wife, Houston.  Jace is immediately taken by Nellie, seeing a beautiful woman, not a fat frumphy old maid.  He must fight Nellie's loyalty to her family and their machinations to keep Nellie at their beck and call.  Complicating the matter is a deceased woman's gift of three wishes to Nellie in an attempt to earn her way into Heaven.  Unfortunately those wishes only make Nellie's life worse.<br /><br />I liked the story originally and still do, but my view of it has changed somewhat over the years.  I found the whole \\"fairy godmother\\" bit to be unnecessary.  Much of what happened could have happened even without the three wishes complicating the situation.  Where I once loved Nellie, upon rereading it, I find her to be without a speck of backbone and not only has blinders on where it concerns her family, but goes out of her way to not see anyone as they really are.  That said, I might still recommend the book to someone who has never read any of Jude's books before.  Especially since there is only one real sex scene, one that isn't too graphic compared to some of her later books.	2000-07-16

Her best friend's brother seemed perfect.  Spencer Smith was handsome,  intelligent, and rarely in town.  He agreed to be the donor, with one  change.  Spencer would give his sperm the old-fashioned way, through sex.   Suddenly, a business deal to have a baby becomes very personal.<br />The  coldbloodedness of the premise made it hard to get into the story.  Spencer  is immature and Jenna is a bit self-absorbed.

Caleb Turner was known for his inventions and his &quot;bimbo of the month&quot; relationships.  When Sabrina Saunders causes him to badly sprain his ankle, Caleb blackmails her into protecting him from his hordes  of women.  Close quarters cause new feelings in Caleb: possessiveness,  jealousy, and love.<br />Second book in a trilogy about the owner-operators of  Rent-a-Wife, an agency designed to help busy career people with mundane  chores.  Not as good as HUSBAND ON DEMAND, the changes in Caleb's views of  women and relationships are not shown in a convincing manner.  More could  have been done with Sabrina's family relationship.	2000-05-29

Benedick announces Noel will be returned to her home  after Epiphany, to await a husband chosen by Benedick.

After graduating from college, she broke free of the ivory tower, living life to the fullest.  Working toward her dream of a designer boutique, Sophia has  settled in Texas.  She wants cowboys and excitement, not intellectual  wizards.  Wizards like Dr. Max Travers, professor of mathematics and friend  of Sophia's parents, another genius whose life is staid and refined.  Max  sees Sophia as the box of crayons he was never allowed as a child.  He  wants all her color and life and excitement.  All he has to do is convince  her that he can be passionate about more than mathematics.<br />An early Jayne  Ann Krentz, it is a delightful read.  Max is not one of her typical Alpha  males, but is still all man.  He rescues Sophia from an abusive cowboy,  manuevers himself into her life, and is supportive of Sophia's dreams and  schemes.	2000-05-18

He works hard and long hours, taking frequent business trips.  She is a stay-at-home mom, busying with the girls and the house.  When a friendship with a  coworker goes too far (just short of sex), Kirk believes he has fallen in  love with another woman.  His timing is exquisite.  Unknown to Kirk, Claire  is pregnant with their fourth child.  Claire throws him out, but now Kirk  thinks they should get help to try and put their marriage back  together.<br />The reactions of Claire and Kirk are dead on.  It is a story of  putting their marriage back together again, but it is still a love story.   You learn how both think and regret past errors.  Kirk's family history  explains why he is struggling with his betrayal of their marriage vows.   You can feel his and Claire's pain.  Subplots about the eldest daughter's  problems and a dear friend's shaky romance lend texture and depth to the  story without detracting from the primary focus.<br />If you like stories with  depth and feeling, buy this book.  You'll soon be feeling the pain and  betrayal and the need for renewal with Claire and Kirk.	2000-05-18

Just returned from a disaster in Africa, mercenary soldier Ebenezer Scott went too far in discouraging teenager Sally Johnson's crush.  Now, six years later, Eb has left his active service and wants to woo Sally, but  first he must protect her, her blind aunt and young cousin from returning  enemies.<br />Sally and Eb's love story is joined by a separate story about  her aunt and a former lover, distracting the reader.  In addition, other  mercenaries are introduced for future books, grabbing your attention.  That  said, this is still a terrific book, mixing the action and romance nicely.   Sally is now enough woman to accept Eb's work, rough visitors, and Eb's  macho quirks.  You will even feel pity for drug lord and killer, Manuel  Lopez, a man with his own peculiar honor.<br />I look forward to stories about  Cy and Lisa, Maggie and Cole, Callie and Micah.  And please give Rodrigo  his own woman.	2000-05-18

If you are looking for gentle humor and pathos, this is the story for you.  Although the setup implies a violent trend to the book, we don't really see  much of that (thank heavens).  What we do see is a heroine who is learning  to live and love for herself, not for others.  A pregnant woman in jeopardy  who is willing to do whatever it takes to save her unborn child, and a man  who is torn between his ancient culture and a new life in America, a  runaway in need of love, this book has it all.  A gentle love story that  will delight you, Tender Heart is worth a look.	2000-05-07

I found the hero's attitude (I am a prince, you should be honored) very realistic.  The poor heroine is clueless, but delightful.  I enjoyed how she made her hero sweat it out and the scenes between them were delightful.   However...the only thing that dropped my personal rating of this book from  a 5 to a 4 1/2 was the ending.  It seemed too abrupt and as if the heroine  gave in.  I did feel that the hero grew throughout the book, and that is  rare in this type of stories.  Good job!	2000-04-23

Another great episode in the Honor Harrington series.  I have never been disappointed, despite the fact that I rarely read SF anymore and never really cared for &quot;hard SF&quot;.  My one complaint?  The coverart makes Honor look like Michael and/or LaToya Jackson!  Please, use another  model in the future!	2000-04-23

The characterization between the veteran cowboy and the young wannabe was well done.  You can see the beginnings of Flanagan's new rodeo series in this  book.  I would recommend it, but be aware that it is set in a much earlier  time.  It is not a contemporary.  If you love westerns that focus on  relationships, buy this book.	2000-04-23
US	52258595	ROCOB5OI076HI	0553100874	270984394	Wicked Widow	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A little too expensive!	Vanza was interesting when I first read about it.  It was a bit overdone in this book.  It seems that anyone can go and learn Vanza (or even stay at home to study) and there is no screening of the applicants.  I truly hate to agree with the others, but I would definitely recommend waiting until  this book is out in paperback or at the library before buying it.  The  chemistry was weak and the magic missing.	2000-04-19

And I also admit that I don't read much &quot;hard science fiction&quot; nowadays.  With that out of the way, please let me disagree  with the others listed here by stating that I was engulfed in the  Harrington universe immediately.  I care for more than just Honor, although  she first drew me in.  I enjoyed the looks at everyone else's lives.  Weber  is strongest in his characterization and makes you care for the people he  writes about.  All of them, not just one or two!  I look forward to the  next episode about the Peeps and the Manties!	2000-03-12

The author &quot;tries&quot; to be &quot;fair and understanding&quot; to romance books and readers.  However, the underlying  theme I got from this study was &quot;I only read these books for my  thesis, I would NEVER personally enjoy them!&quot; which is a great pity.   This is a book that is interesting to read for the background and analysis  contained within.  But, if you are a romance reader, as I am, you will be  tempted to contact the author and educate her.  Don't try, it never works.	2000-03-12

(Rodeo Riders, 1)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Instruction and adventure in the same book	I am a big fan of the rodeo (every Sunday night is spent with Donny Gay on TNN), so this book's setting intrigued me.  To be honest, most contemporary westerns bore me and I was afraid that this book would be horrible, but how  wrong I was.  I am a sucker for relationships and the growning affection  and respect between Jake and Clay was perfect.  I am eagerly looking  forward to RIGGED TO RIDE, the second in this series.  If you like rodeo,  good characterizations, or pure adventure, buy this book!  You won't be  disappointed.  In addition, I learned more about the details of various  rodeo events without slowing the story down.	2000-01-10

Weber's Honor Harrington series is a delight even to those of us who don't particularly like military series.  The difference is that Weber draws detailed characters on all sides of an issue.  His two short stories in  this collection continue that tradition, as do his fellow authors.  If I  had a problem with any of these stories, it was with Green's tale of the  Peeps and Manties.  The details were overdone and the characterization, the  thing I most love about Honor, is found in bits and pieces throughout the  book.  Still, I would recommend it to anyone wanting more background on  Honor's universe.  In fact, I would like to see more stories about  Stephanie Harrington and Queen Adrienne.	1999-01-03

This time she ventures into the medical field, giving an edge to the type of book that Betty Neels is famous for.  And, as usual, she scores a bulls-eye!  Although a failure to communicate is behind the misunderstanding between the heroine and hero, it is well-thought out.  If I were accused of being responsible for another's death for two long years, I wouldn't be inclined to try once again to tell the truth.  Palmer's heroine is broken, both in spirit and body.  Her hero must heal himself before he can heal her.  Lovely and engrossing, I stayed up all night to finish this book!	1997-10-28
