I'll start by saying the book is a good book for anyone playing in the Forgotten Realms setting. This book is perfect for DMs and not as important for players, although players who wish to play in an evil group will find this book very useful. Any DM that wishes to tackle the pcs with an evil group will find a lot of support and ideas in this book including stats, items, influence, npcs, allies, locations, maps etc. It also adds a handful of prestige classes specific to some of the evil groups including Church of Cyric (Spur Lords), Worshipers of Entropy(Entropist), Zhentarim's Sky mages, Thayan Knights of the Red Wizards and even the Darkmask for surface drow that follow Vhaeraun. The end of the book contains favored magical items and favored spells to some of the groups. Some of the groups have character leaders stats and items. I had to hold back from rating this book as a single reason which I thought is important as someone who plays with psionics. The books contains no psionical support, or even a psionical option, for cults like the Mindflayers which are obviously psionically oriented. Other than that, I highly recommend the book, especially for playing in or against evil groups.	2001-11-07

The book is interesting and adds many prestiege classes, many require some degree of arcane casting.  Just like the Defenders of Faith, the guide adds feats, magickal items and new spells.  Still I must express my disappointment that the book has no spells what so ever that affect psionics despite the fact that the book has a presteige class 'Mind Bender', which  irritated me because a presteige class like that should have been put in Psionicis Handbook.  One thing of note in my opinion is that this book does not provide major powers to the wizards/sorcerers as much as the Defenders of Faith did to Clerics/Paladins.  A big plus in the book is the fact that there are a lot more support for 'evil' pcs in this book due to the presence of prestiege classes that require a none good alignment, such as Pale Masters and True Necromancers.	2001-06-29

This book is actually 3 side adventures and not just one.  The first designed for level 9+ party, second is 11+ and third is 13+.  Book is very detailed and and uses a combination of the Scar-lands and regular D&amp;D deities and monsters.  Creature Collection and Monster Manual are not necessary but recommended if you have a party of 5 or more players and you wish to add difficulty.  All three side adventures are designed as a quest after a magical artifact.  The first of those is for a Sphere of Anihilation, second is the Globe of Arden and last is the holy sword of Kraith.  Of course all those artifacts can be substituted by your own artifacts or items.  The three adventures are tricky and not easy to finish, as it does require a full team of players and the four basic classes at least at level 5 (wizards, rogues, warriors, clerics).  Disable Device and level 5+ arcane caster is a must to survive and get through the tricky parts of the adventures.  So far I have bought the three adventures put out by Sword &amp; Sorcery of Necromancer Games and White-Wolf; none of them have disappointed me.  I hope they keep up the good work.  The other two modules produced by Sword and Sorcery are Rappan Athuk I and The Cruicible of Freya.	2001-04-06

I do agree with many of the other reviewers, Eric Griffin has a hot topic but lacks a decent story.  I have to admit it is slightly better than the Clan Novel: Tremere mainly because you actually see some Tremere magic this time, very little of it.  The author keeps describing the areas, emotions and objects but leaves the reader lost because of the lack of a plot.  Personally, I must admit I also hate the style the book was written in which a chapter focuses on one scene and then the next on another and the one after returns to the previous scene.  That style added irritation more than mystry to the already plot lacking book.	2001-03-29

Normal Necromancer Games products value roll-playing as much as role-playing. The dungeon is a tomb that becomes later a temple and later leading to gates of hell or the fabled mithril city. This is part 1 and it's only from ground level to level 4. These first parts of the dungeon take level 4 characters to level 8. If I was to rate how difficult the dungeon is, I would say 9 out of 10. What's nice about the Rappan Athuk series is that they can be added to any campaign. The tombs can simply be anywhere in your world. I attached them to the module Crucible of Freya since it took characters from level 1 to 3 and is supposed to be in the same world as the Rappan Athuks. Perhaps the best feature of the dungeon is it's freedom of a controlling theme. The characters have a goal and a lot of clues but there are no timed events waiting to happen after a certain amount of time or themes have passed. The middle levels are accessible at all times as long as you solve the puzzles or get through the nasty battles. I have tried the other D&D modules and they are pretty good but I believe this one is the best one out there so far when it comes to challenge and roll-playing.	2001-03-07

The Hunteres are introduced smoothly in the book and it does a great job of showing their human side.  It is starts slow and catches up with excitment as the main character realizes something is wrong with him.  Definately recommended, but unfortunately the book has no previous ties what so ever to Predator and Prey: Vampire.  I hope the author plans to eventually make a bigger theme from this six book series.	2001-01-29

Honestly, I would equivilance this book to the Clan Novel Toreodor.      The bad side of it includes that the story is too vague to be truly  enjoyed.  Everything is in a dream state description.  And most of all, I  did not find any section of it pulling me to read it like some of the other  Clan Novels.  An example I would give is the beginning of it where  Sturbridge is involved in a big ritual.  How she got up there, the powers  she used, the little component details were all lacking.  The whole thing  had little background and a lot of dream description.   On the good side of  the story, it did explain the Giovanni death. The author was really good  about showing damn disciplined is the Tremere clan. <br />Not the best of the  clan novels, that's for sure.	2000-08-18

I have read his previous books  (Legend, Waylander, In the Realm of the Wolf and even The King Beyond the  Gate). When I looked over this book, I didn't there could be more added to  the story. between Druss, his legend and what happens after.  The book  starts slow at first but it picks up fast.  If you read any books from the  series this book will fill in some background on those books that you  didn't think were there.  If you're thinking about reading this book first  and using it to judge how the rest of the series are, this would be a good  idea.  The book can be independant and in all cases exciting.  I suggest  reading Against the Horde or Legend before reading this one though, you'll  be more impressed that way.	2000-08-13

Very similar in nature to the Ventrue style except there is a lot more violance.  In this novel the main story-line starts moving rapidly.  Things are happening with the Camirella and Sabbat.  I saw  one bloodline I didn't think they were gonna put too, that made me happy.   The biggest surprise ever is for people who played Vampire, the Redemption,  the computer game from white-wolf.  If you did, you will see someone in the  novel you are very familiar to.  I highly recommend this book,  unfortunately at this point, you have to read the previous books in series.  At least Toreador, Gangrel, Setite and Ventrue.	2000-07-02

I will have to say that the book is different.  Unbelievable amount of cussing in it and vulgar descriptions which is not a surprise.  Justin went out of his way on this one.  Storywise, it definately beats the malkavian  and toreador novel.  Backgroundwise, nice references to the maelstorms and  a hint of what is up with cappidocian (don't want to spoil it but read  carefully the scenes of Isabella and her grandmother).  Plotwise, barely  tied to the main plot.  Only thing I didn't like was the lack of  necromancy.  Giovanni were slick mafia people but the majority hardly acted  like necromancers.  That's very sad and I predict is not gonna be repeated  in the Tremere Novel, at least I hope not,  I don't want to see Tremeres  that barely use Thaumaturgy. One last word, no kid should read this book,  well all world of darkness is not for kids but this one is out of question,  yes it's that level.  Just my opinion.	2000-06-08

The book shows the different events and systems for the Dark Ages for Kindred of the East and it does a  very nice job.  Among my favorite is the list of the old weapons used in  the far east like the naginata and the sai.  Overall the book was good, but  of course good only for those interested in Kindred of the East.	2000-06-01

First the back of the book has more distinct characters (with stats and all) for you to use in  stories.  Second, the antitribute are given some examples in the sample  concepts of characters.  Third the old powers in the old clanbook are  modified and made better, plus a couple added more.  There is a lot more  literature and background for people to read.  And I even think it's done  better than the revised Nosferatu Clanbook.	2000-05-30

The stories include the death of Baba Yaga, return of the succubus club and even a Kuei-jin interaction story  between them and the kindred.  I definately recommend the book. You  seriously can't go wrong if you are a story teller or a wanna be.  Best of  all they also provide sweet sections on extra sub-stories to be added and  how it can be handled.  Sub-stories include the way the assamites broke the  curse, the way Salout and Tremere interact for clan control and even the  way camirella took back New York plus more.   <br />Simply put....I really  liked the book.	2000-05-18

First impression I had for the first part of the book....'disorienting'.  No one denies that the writer sure mad malkavians mad.  However, I am sad to say that the writer lost me in it.  Things never mad sense...okay they  are malkavian they are not supposed to make sense.  I think the  disorienting part of it is that you have no clue when his hallucinations  are occuring compared to the rest.  You gotta pay close attention to the  dates of the chapters and the dates on previous events in the previous clan  novels.   The best part by far of the book is the end....the author  seriously excels during that part and finally you start to make _some_  (some not fully) sense of the story.	2000-05-18

I found it really helpful in making elder vampires and dealing with the new changes produced ever since the 3rd  edition came out.  They had little detail ruling, e.g. does a vampire have  fingerprints?  Plus some inside information on the changes happening.  It  describe _a lot_ of the bloodlines and what happened to them, including  Baali, True Brujah and Nagaraja.  I recommend this book to storytellers,  not players.	2000-03-17

I guess there are two ways to look at this book.  First one would be background and resource for VTM games.  I believe it sheds some light on a fact a lot of DMs hate to reveal, which is, it's okay to let other players  use some thaumaturgical disciplines specialized for their clans if their  background is correct.  The second way is how many new things are  introduced in the book.  There are so many disciplines in there for mages  from different clans.  I really believe this is great, I love to see  diversity in the game.  The rituals there have been creatively put  together.  I think the book supplies excellent background for more stories  and resources plus introduction of new disciplines and rituals.  I highly  recommend the book.	2000-02-21

I don't know how to describe this novel, but I never thought Ravnos were too much to handle till I read this.  But seriously, this novel produces a player that was hidden in the game although was involved in the previous  novels. And I have to admit I really liked the Ravnos main character  Khalid.  It's funny considering the arabic translation of his name means  &quot;Eternal&quot; or someone who is living forever.  The book is highly  recommended.	2000-02-13

Sometimes the series is hopeless and doesn't really captivate you; that's not the case here.  The book goes back and forth between the  minds of both competitors (although I freaking swear the author is baised  to Strahd). What's even great about it s that the book leaves you craving  for more.

Well, first a small word to first time role-players in Vampire the Masquerade.  If you have never tried the game, you don't know what you are missing in your life.  Now here are the things I found to be sooo much  better and distinctively different in the third edition than the second.  Note how much the rules are so much better as well when you read them. a)  Assimite Disciplines fixed to be useful b) Presence has a kick to it when  used against some much lower generation. c) Fortitude is so much better  explained now (some used to claim it as automatic soaking all the time). d)  Combat has some good changes. e) Obfuscate limits are actually explained!  f) Serpentis III is different and so much better. g) Celerity uses one  blood per round to activate, was worded before as if it used one blood for  each celerity point. There are so much more I can go on with but I figured  if you went this far down I probably got your interest enough to go get it.	2000-01-13

First I'd like to point out to those who haven't started the series, don't let the slow start of Toreador put you down the stories are really good. This novel of the clan Assimite does a very unique job of actually  capturing the mind set of the clan.  It does a great job showing the elders  as true followers of their religion and path.  What is even more awesome is  the way the background is portrayed for the story. Some mysteries are  solved yet even more are evolved.  Are the Assimites a tool or are they the  users?  A very capturing book by Fleming, then again anything less should  not be expected from such a good author.	2000-01-05

Clan Ventrue was nicely done, not as awesome as the Setites but great none the less.  I do agree with one of the other readers, the clan need to display some awe and dominance of their will.

Well, I am a bit disappointed on how the Clan  Toreador just comes out as completely weak.  I  could have sworn that white wolf clan book claimed the clan to be potentially the most dangerous clan of them all.  However and on  the bright side, the series does start with a very interesting plot, the  book does not completely focus on the clan Toreador.  Probably because the  author wishes to introduce the series.  I have read till Setite before I  wrote the reviews, I think the book is good over all.	1999-11-29

I must admit a book like this has been needed long ago.  I myself prefer to play Vampire, the Dark Ages over Vampire, the Masquerade.  The book  shows Jerusalem as the center of faith in the dark ages, which is somewhat  true since to all of the three main religons in the world, Jerusalem is a  city of holy importance.  How can a vampire survive with all this faith  around?  How much of the vampire's faith is twisted for the character to  survive? The book gives a decent picture of the past situation of the  religons involved with some twists.  Highly recommended.	1999-10-29
