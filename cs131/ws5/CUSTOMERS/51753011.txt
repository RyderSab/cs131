Now there is no problem in writing about Husserl or anybody else in the history of philosophy from whatever vantage point one wants to; it can prove fruitful exercise.  But when one claims to illuminate key historical figures for the student, one is responsible to illuminate the point of view from which its really justified at all to compile such a companion on the relevant philosopher.  Using this book as a guide to Husserl would leave you wondering &quot;well so what did this guy do all in all.&quot;  Husserl as presented here is a philosophical logician of  Russell variety, but seriously perplexed in his engagement with the problems, but with occassional insights in this or that subject.  Well if this is what we should understand from Husserl, then he doesn't deserve a place in no companion to landmark philosophers. If he does he should be taken from the point of view of the tradition in which he has achieved his historical stature as the founder of the phenomenological school (which doesnt mean we should be uncritical and dogmatic)<BR>The essays here deserve much better than two stars, some of them are very good quality.

First of all this book is over-simplified to the point of uselessness for any meaningful understanding beyond even maybe high-school levels at times.  The historical orientation here seems to mean chronological- that you start with Aristotle and come down to Mill or Kuhn both without getting anything beyond magazine level information nor some (relevant and important) sense of historical connectedness, which would require a more extensive treatment of each philosopher at any rate.. So the historical thrust fails for the reason that the level of the book is too low to seriously carry it out, and maybe the author's knowledge on past philosophers is not deep enough - as is common in English language philosophy.  I want to believe the first reason is truer, but in any case i think this book's level of treatment will be boringly low for most interested adult (over twenty let's say) readers, and its wiser to try a non-historical introduction to the topic.	2002-04-04

Students of some intelligence need books that are really engaging and developing, and not just encyclopedic knowledge. Of course by reading this sort of a book we may learn definitions of concepts like noema and noemata, but I believe we would better have no idea of a subject than having a junk of poor and lifeless concepts. I would recommend the reader, especially the more sophisticated and good-willed one, to turn to Husserl's own numerous introductions like Cartesian Meditations or the Crisis even if he does not know much phenomenology, and put some sweat into them. Still this book might be helpful with some undergraduate exams- to'fill in' papers.	2001-06-02

I have been through other works of Arda Denkel not available in English- he published in Turkish as well, and more important than that, I have been a student of this wonderful person and exquisite teacher, and I know that he was the sort of person one can meet only a few times in one's life.  What I want to emphasize is the absolute capacity this man had to bring you upto date in the most complex domains of analytic philosophy,  even when your background was limited.  So with a degree of extra effort Arda Denkel's works on various specific topics can be used as guides to the respective domains they are dealing with.  He was a great expositor and teacher, and he had a gift to make the most complex ideas understandable even to the beginner. So while he surely will be dealing with specific and technical issues in this book, he will make sure to have carried you to the same platform as he is.  If I have the opportunity to read the book, I still have other books by Denkel on my reading list even though I plunged into continental philosophy since then, I will update my review. This book should specifically be very relevant to problems like those of particularism and ontological status of universals, and similar central issues of analytic ontology. Arda Denkel had a very sound background in the history of philosophy, he wrote quite extensively on Aristotle and British empricism along other historical epochs, even though he was oblivious to what was going on on the continent, as is the case with most analytic philosophers.  If today I wanted to go deeply into analytic stuff I would start with Denkel's writings, few of which are available in English.	2001-05-23

Beside presenting in a lucid and not oversimplified way the ideas of Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, Cottingham situates them both in historical context and in the context of contemporary debates like those of philosophy of mind (certainly so far as we can expect from an introductory work).  Oversimplification often harms books like those of the Opus series, so that it often ends up in a book without much content.  Cottingham's might be the best in the series.

Edwin Curley is a typical anglo-saxon philosopher and his book is an  elaborated text book introduction to Spinoza.  He shows you the main  arguments for Spinoza's claims without giving you much insight into what  Spinoza intends by his ('God or Nature') thesis and the importance of his  point.  It will be an easy but quite futile and unrewarding reading.  It is  a good help to the newcoming student but is not what would be expected from  some thirty years of study on the topic.  I recommend that people take time  to read the original ethics some number of times, go and study classical  philosophers' texts like Aristotle and Aquinas, and then wait for life to  distill in them the wisdom to understand Spinoza in truth.  Do not go to  second hand resources like these (you can read people like Deleuze on the  topic(expressionism in philosophy) who is a philosopher in his own right)  since it is questionable how  these professors are superior to you.  Philosophy begins by taking epistemic responsibility and I don't know how  anyone teach that.  You should trust your gut feelings as Spinoza did.  You  don't need Edwin Curley to teach that to you.  You will need this book only  to get good grades in an undergraduate course.	2000-08-05
