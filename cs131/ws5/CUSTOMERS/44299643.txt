Cadillac Beach is Tim Dorsey's sixth Florida novel about Serge and Lenny, Florida's own Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, as they tilt, no, shoot at windmills and other Florida sources of irritability. All six novels are filled with Dorsey's frenetic energy and a dozen laughs a page. Three of Tim's previous novels are, in THIS Florida writer's opinion, masterpieces: Hammerhead Ranch, Triggerfish, and Orange Crush. With Cadillac, Tim takes a stab at the multi-plotted, multi-chronologized architectonic novel, sort of a John Dos Passos USA except it's FLA. Tim doesn't make any mistakes here and the novel is a welcome fix for Dorsey addicts. However, there's not even ONE mention of the old TV series \\"Everglades,\\" I believe it was on CBS, I do not remember the actor's name but he played a park ranger in the Glades, riding on an airboat, chasing poachers or commies or something. NOT ONE MENTION. I'm not going to remove any of my five stars, however. Except for this one flaw, Cadillac Beach is seamless, perfect, hilarious, and even has a TUNE, that's Totally Unexpected Noir Ending. Read Cadillac Beach or I'll send Serge and Lenny to your house. (Love that Lenny!)	2004-03-27

The cops, Bloom and Rawles, are wonderful, full dimensional characters.

MacDonald essentially indicts our entire society. This novel's more relevant today than ever, MacDonald was truly visionary.

I usually read crime novels -- and came upon this after reading &quot;Touch&quot; by Elmore Leonard -- and I was really awesomely surprised by this. I think this kind of novel is so much more important, and worthy of our time, than something like &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; or these other 2-million page Pynchonian encyclopedias that no one actually reads. Read &quot;Mariette in Ecstasy&quot; and you will be pleased,impressed and maybe even awed.	2003-05-03

Okay, it's easy to say &quot;this is Tim's best novel so far&quot; but that doesn't tell you anything. First of all, it's a great wild comic romp, reminiscent of Catch-22, The World According to Garp, and A Confederacy of Dunces. A lot of characters and plot threads are seamlessly woven together for a Mad Mad Mad Mad World/Magic Christian type of effect. Tim's getting really good at this type of thing, the climax is as good or better than the Great Dale Mabry Slow-Speed Chase in Triggerfish Twist. As best as I can tell, what we're doing here is returning to pick up the &quot;Serge&quot; story from the end of Hammerhead Ranch Motel. In the interim Tim's written two great fables, the classic Middle American Family Moves To Florida And Meets Neighbors fable, and the Great Florida Governor's Race fable. Now, back to the mayhem. I have to admit Tim's first two novels were tough going for me, keeping the characters and plot lines straight. Stingray Shuffle didn't pose that problem, and I can't say it's because this is a &quot;better&quot; novel -- although it certainly &quot;felt&quot; better to me -- or if it's just that I'm reading Tim more carefully now, I'm more tuned in to what he's doing. I've learned, anyway, that trying to keep a scorecard is part of the fun of reading Tim Dorsey. An awesome character, Eugene Tibbs aka Blind Jelly Doughnut, is introduced, Tim's agent Nat Sobel makes a cameo appearance as the backwardly-monickered &quot;Tanner Lebos,&quot; and five most excellent babes, the BBB, add sauciness to the mix, doing the things divorced ladies in their forties do when they visit Florida. (HEY, I want to meet the one who's hot for Meyer!) As I read the other reviewers I'm a little concerned about this ranking thing, whether Tim's &quot;surpassed&quot; Carl or is better than Carl now. That's silly talk. These guys are doing ENTIRELY different kinds of books, although there's plenty of surface similarity. They each offer a particular world-view and artistic vision. Both are righteous, honest, and truthful. And different. Write on, guys!vision. Both are righteous, honest, and truthful. And different. Write on, guys!	2003-03-31

The story of Tampa's newest residents, the Davenports from Indiana, is a classic modern American fable. Dorsey exhibited comic genius in his first two novels although I found the plots slightly meandering. The third, Orange Crush, was well-plotted but perhaps not quite as hilarious. In Triggerfish, Dorsey has perfectly balanced all the elements. Perfectly plotted, pithy satire, easy to read but hard to put down. I'm a writer in the Tampa Bay area myself, and I guess I'll have to stick to the gritty hard-crime stuff, because Dorsey is the king of Tampa Bay comedy-satire. I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO HAVE WRITTEN THIS. Read Dorsey now, the guy's still young and he's got a lot of comedy left in him. Excellent work, Tim, esp. the &quot;jaws of the apocalypse&quot; thing.	2002-05-17

Carl's the physicist who can also do small things, balance the checkbook and write the basic crime novel. Perhaps the critics of Sick Puppy got to the man...but please, Carl, you are capable of so much more, of the complex novel spilling out from its covers. Hiaasen heroes Skink and Jim Tile are missed here. Can't give it less than five stars, but this is the simplest and easiest Hiaasen novel to date.

The love of baseball, especially the Red Sox. The sneakers. The thug jacket, shades and black glove. Notice that Parker and the dog are at the bottom of an ascending staircase. Where they are, it's dark, but Parker/Spenser is LOOKING INTO THE LIGHT, or conversely, the lights shines ON him. He neither flinches into the light near resists it, he seems to be  COMMUNING with it.

He's stuck-up and judgmental. I much prefer Tomlinson, but then I liked Meyer better than I liked Travis McGee. Doc Ford -- White -- is certainly a brain, and you can learn a heck of a lot reading these books. This is my second Doc Ford novel, I read Mangrove Coast and I think I liked it better. Don't get me wrong. I'd love to write books as good as White's, but he just doesn't rsonate with me the way Jim Hall's books about Thorn do, or even Ed McBain's Matthew Hope series. The story was OK, in fact it was very Travis McGee in the way Doc Ford sets up his bad guys and takes them out. I thought the subplot about the two spatting lovers that Doc Ford re-unites was almost superfluous, added in to make the book longer. So all in all, not great but not too bad either. I think White could have made one point a little more forcefully...we're ALL swimming in a river of sharks, the world.	2001-08-15

The details can be found in the reviews below, but in a more general sense, this is Dorsey's first true masterpiece. His previous works, while right-on outrageous, were difficult to follow, a bit plotless and sketchy on the characterizations. Dorsey has finally put it all together, and for the first time he truly deserves a ranking next to Carl Hiaasen. This is the work of a great comic writer at the height of his artistic abilities, and I believe his best work is still yet to come. Drink deeply the Orange Crush, and read it slow -- the next Hiaasen novel won't be out until January 2002!	2001-07-26

It's not the best version. I have the greatest respect for Parker. Looking for Rachel Wallace is a masterpiece of the modern mystery, the first mystery I ever read, and fifteen years later I'm writing them myself. I do whatever it takes to get a new Spenser novel, even though in the last ten years they've been longer on humor and shorter on action (with the exception of Thin Air). No matter. I could read a book with Spenser, Hawk and Susan doing nothing but sitting around a table, I'd be immensely entertained. But Rhapsody has none of the humor, none of the cleverness, none of the insight Parker is famous for. It's limp, boring, and dies on the page. It's a struggle to make it to the end. I love Parker, but there's no wit or humor here, no real plot twists, no life. Even the great ones put out the occasional dud. Sorry, Bob.	2001-06-08

In The Art of Fiction, John Gardner says that a novelist who doesn't care about his characters suffers from &quot;frigidity.&quot; Date suffers from ice.<br />The characters are 2-dimensional cartoons, used by Date to reach his predictable conclusion. The JR and stepmother plotline is trite, predictable, as well as the Nolan and Barbie plotline. Date always telegraphs what's going to happen next, leaving no suspense. The only mildly interesting character is Romer, but Date make him act out of character and illogically.<br />This was also the problem with Date's later novel, Smokeout, although I didn't quite see it then. Date doesn't let his characters free to be themselves. He doesn't respect them. He puts them in straitjackets. Frankly, if this guy weren't a journalist with personal contacts, no one would publish him, and I don't care what nice things Hiaasen says on the book jackets. You want to read REAL comedy in the tradition of Hiaasen, read TIM DORSEY! His stuff is REALLY funny!	2001-06-04

Hiaasen's novels make it clear that BOTH sides, all sides of politics are immoral. Date's attempt to hijack the Hiaasen style for a narrow political purpose make this novel not art, but propaganda. Moreover, I didn't even laugh once. If you or I had written this, instead of a well-connected reporter, it would never have been printed--and shouldn't have been.	2001-05-23
US	44299643	R11HWMP99RAUUP	0446604666	198501177	Sick Puppy	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A masterpiece by a master	I really do not understand all the reviewers below complaining about Carl writing \\"the same old thing\\" again. I guess they expect he should write a Gothic romance or an episode of Star Trek. Eco-comedies about Florida ARE what the man writes, but Sick Puppy finally transcends the genre and becomes great literature. Great American literature. For those who haven't figured it out, Skink and Jim Tile are Hiassen's Huck Finn and runaway slave Jim, the Everglades is their Mississippi, the cons they encounter their Duke and Dauphin. Skink is a Christ-figure (in an earlier novel where Skink steals the electronic tracking collar from an endangered Florida panther, Jim says Skink wears the collar \\"like a sacred obligation\\"). Yes, there are elements from Hiaasen's previous work here. The same bogus complaint could be charged against Hemingway, Shakespeare or the Beatles. Carl has taken those elements and recombined them here into the greatest American novel since The World According to Garp. (Hey, complainers, did you catch the allusions to Eugene Ionesco's \\"Rhinoceros\\"? I didn't think so! How about the references to Faulkner's \\"The Bear\\"? I didn't think so.) Carl's critics need to learn a little bit more about literature and about how to read.  No living American writer -- well, maybe John Irving -- is creating greater art, being more honest with us, or saying anything more important.	2001-04-19
