Sebald gave a now famous series of lectures at the University of Zurich in which he argued that German writers had almost universaliy neglected to document the horrors of the Allied bombing campaign against Germany. The air war, Sebald said, resulted in a national crisis of extreme proportion. Yet it was all but invisible in the national literature. He concluded that this absence was the result of an unspoken agreement among German  writers to respect the taboo that had arisen in postwar Germany against speaking of the bombing, essentially a cultural conspiracy, the effects of which have lasted to the present.<br />He published them as a book Luftkrieg und Literatur, or Air War and Literature, two years later, in which he discussed some of the letters he received in response to provide more context to the lectures.<br />This is the English translation of that book. In which Sebald has called for a &quot; natural history of the destruction,&quot; one that would comprehensively document the sheer number of the dead, the floods of refugees, the fires that caused the water in Hamburg's canals to boil, the sudden flourishing of rats and flies and other parasites that feed off corpses. The possiblity that the air war transformes a society of perpetrators into a society of victims.<br />Wonderful clear writing, the world will miss him	2003-08-07

His writings make me explore my own inter feelings and thoughts. In Austerlitz I things he has done so more than any other of his wonderful masterpieces.To me the importance of our individualty seemed to be so much of what makes this book and our lifes valid.At one point Sebald writes,I had for a good while been watching the toilers in the city gold mines as they came to meet at their wartering hole early in the evening all of them identical in their dark blue suits, striped shirts, and gaudy ties, and as I tried to grasp the mysterious habits of the members of this species, which is not to be found in any beastiary-their preferance for crowding close together, their semi-gregarious, semi-aggressive demeanor, the way they put their throats back in emptying their glasses, the increasingly excitable babble of their voices the sudden hasty departure of one or another of them. At another point Sebald says;I already felt in my head the dreadful torpor that heralds disintergration of the personality,I sensed that in truth I had neither memory nor the power of thought, nor even any existence, that all my life had been a constant process of obliteration, a turning away from myself and the world.If someone had come then to lead me away to place of execution I would have gone meekly, without a word, without so much as opening my eyes,...As you read Sebald's wonderful proust like prose and he finds inspiration in the most unexpected places,you wonder did the German Reich take Austerlitz parents away like they took away peoples individuality ? Just as all the people involved in this terrible deed did so by depersonlizing a people.	2001-12-16

That we are an Empire(the last) with military bases on every continent, as well as ten aboard the aircraft carrier called the United Kingdom. And best of all to me that Clare boothe Luce was at the Ritze hotel in Paris when the Germans swept through France. She wanted to stay to the very end, but the concierge told her that she must leave the now diserted hotel, because &quot;the Germans are coming&quot;. When Clare asked him how he knew , he said because they have reservations. Its little jewels like this that make a great book one you must own.	2001-11-17
