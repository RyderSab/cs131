Good Intro for Dick Neophyte	It's tempting to say that these stories from 1954, 1955, 1958, and 1963 represent great periods of prolific creativity for Dick and the working out of themes and ideas that later found their way into his more famous novels.  But Dick was more often than not prolific and frequently recycled motifs and themes and even character names from stories into novels.  What the Dick scholar will find here is a growing emphasis, at least in the short story format, on illusion and fakery, the seeds of some of Dick's novels, and, for the first time, stories which convey the frequent despair and desperation of those novels.    But the Dick fan and scholar is going to read this collection as a matter of course.  What does it offer for those just discovering Dick or his casual readers?    Of course, there is the famous title story.  However, with it, Dick seems more interested in posing a logic puzzle based on the implications of precognition than making a serious political statement even though the story features much more political intrigue than the movie based on it.  Indeed, with it and several Dick stories here, one gets the sense that the political struggles between various government agencies owe a lot to a study of the Soviet Union or, more probably, the Third Reich. There are other minor stories:  \\"Stand-By\\" and a rare sequel, \\"What'll We Do With Ragland Park?\\".  Their main attraction is Dick's weird speculation on future media -- prophecies which don't seem far from the mark 40 years later.  The \\"news clown\\" of these stories doesn't seem, apart from his makeup, that different from our late night comedy hosts in America.  But then the listings in _TV Guide_ often remind me of Dick. They also show Dick's fondness for theorizing odd mutations of American government.  Here the President has been replaced by computer.    In \\"Novelty Act\\", the nation is ruled by a permanent First Lady who inflicts her cultural tastes on America via public tv.  She's mistress, wife, and mother tothe nation, many of whom long to audition their talents at the White House.  Later incorporated into the novel _The Simulacra_, it is the first story of Dick's that doesn't just mention the despair and desperation of its hero but induces them in the reader as effectively as many of his novels do.    There's also some political fakery afoot in the story and that theme is echoed in \\"The Mold of Yancy\\" (reworked for _The Penultimate Truth_), which features a culture built around a doggedly anodyne Eisenhowerish everyman, and \\"If There Were No Benny Cemoli\\".  The latter is one of the book's highlights and, against a background of searching for war criminals on a devastated Earth, built around the proposition that reality is what the _New York Times_ says it is.  The spirit of a dead businessman haunts the mediasphere and a political convention in \\"What the Dead Man Say\\".  It reminded me of some of the loas in early William Gibson.     Fakery of a forensic sort is the idea of \\"The Unreconstructed M\\".  The idea of a robot built to leave clues designed to frame someone for murder was intriguing.  However, because the story goes on too long and into unnecessary tangents, this is also minor Dick.    At this point in the short story part of his career, Dick seems to be less interested in mutants and berserk machines than before.  Still, we get an automated command and control economy that needs reprogramming in \\"Autofac\\", and \\"Recall Mechanism\\" explores the link between precognitive mutants and certain psychological tics.      The science fiction story device used most often here is time travel.  \\"Service Call\\" has some engineers getting a disturbing glimpse at the future of conformity machinery.  Or, as the ad says, \\"Why be half loyal?\\".  \\"Captive Market\\" has a miserly shopkeeper who only sees a profit where others see a horrifying future.      Time travel gets mixed with meta-science fiction in a couple of uncharacteristic Dick stories.  In \\"Waterspider\\", time travelers come back to snatch Dick's friend Poul Anderson because, you see, all science fiction writers are unconscious precognitives, and they need his help on an experimental space project.  This story drops plenty of famous names and even mentions Dick's inspiration, A. E. van Vogt.  \\"Orpheus with Clay Feet\\" works a witty variation on the idea of time travelers meeting famous artists of the past.  Here uncreative people like our protagonist can take solace in inspiring great works of art if not creating them.  At least, that's how it's supposed to work.  Here the artist is the greatest science fiction writer of all time, Jack Dowland.      \\"Explorers We\\", somewhere in the middle range of quality, strikes one as a _Twilight Zone_ episode about aliens' failure to communicate.  \\"Oh, To Be a Blobel!\\" is a story probably more famous then it deserves to be.  Judging from Dick's notes as to his intentions, it's mostly a failure to illustrate the Nietzsche maxim about becoming a dragon when battling dragons.  However, it works on other levels.    Along with \\"If There Were No Benny Cemoli\\", the gem of the collection is \\"The Days of Perky Pat\\".  While children roam a landscape blighted by nuclear war and engage in useful pursuits like hunting and making knives, their parents are underground and expending their energy on making elaborate layouts for their Barbie-like Perky Pat dolls.  Their infantile obsession with recreating the minutia of a vanished world is enabled by handy care packages dropped by benovelent Martians.  Dick has some weirdly plausible things to say about play and the role of toys in our lives and mental health.  This story also inspired Dick's [[ASIN:0679736662 The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]].    In some ways, the variety of themes here dilutes the power of Dick's typical obsessions, especially the metaphor of machine as an anti-life force.  There are also fewer really exceptional stories here than in the earlier volumes of this series.  However, it is stillas good an introduction to Dick as some of the collections he edited himself.	2004-01-30
US	52939892	R14GWGXRHKJZ3A	0262080400	37445985	Carl Friedrich Gauss	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good Intro to Gauss, But Math Types Will Want More Bio Info	There are two audiences for this book.  The first would be those steeped in math, who know the math of Gauss but not the man.  The second would be those, like me, who have heard of the man but know little of his work or life.  <br />This book may be thin fodder for the first.  Like many intellectual giants, there was little externally interesting in Gauss' life.  His most vigorous physical activities were geodesic surveys in the summer and astronomical observations.  But the mind, the thoughts ...  <br />Gauss, in the eyes of Hall, was the third greatest mathematician of all time, behind only Archimedes and Isaac Newton.  The range of his scientific and mathematical accomplishments is great:  plotting Ceres' orbit -- the first time that was ever done for an asteroid; pinning the Earth's magnetic field as originating in its interior; introducing the statistical concepts of Gaussian (nomal) distribution, error curves, and the least square fitting of data; establishing non-Euclidean geometry; conducting geodesic surveys; pioneering work on elliptic functions and hypergeometric series.  Hall briefly puts these accomplishments in the greater context of scientific and mathematical history<br />But his protean intellect didn't stop with math.  He originally was interested in becoming a philologist and read Russian, Danish, classical Greek and Latin, and English (and was a fan of Sir Walter Scott).  He also put his stastical and actuarial knowledge to practical use in investing.  Besides student fees, he only earned 1,000 thalers a year as a professor but died with an estate worth 153,000 thaler.  <br />As for the life of Gauss, we meet a child prodigy from a very humble background, estranged from a father whose coldness he would emulate towards his own sons.  Duke Ferdinand of Braunschweig, was the royal patron who lifted him out of his common existence and encouraged him.  The Duke's death, from wounds sustained fighting Napoleon at the Battle of Auerstadt, made Gauss a lifetime political conservative.  A blissful first marriage too soon ended with his wife's death.  Two of his six children emmigrated to Missouri and did well for themselves.  One son, Eugene, always had strained relations with his father but was closest to possessing his gifts in languages and math.  He could do elaborate calculations in his head and remember long figures well enough to catch them incorrectly dictated to him.  He also helped compose a dictionary of a Sioux language for use by missionaries.  <br />The words Hall uses most often to describe Gauss' personality are \\"Olympian\\" and \\"cold\\".  His personal motto seems to have been \\"Few But Ripe.\\" when publishing his mathematical discoveries.  He only considered a mathematical proposition finished when he could present in full form without the \\"scaffolding\\" showing of how he arrived at it.  He also wanted his work to be of general significance, and he also didn't want to argue his ideas with intellectual inferiors.  A consequence of this was that several mathematicians were credited with first proposing ideas that were later shown, in his notebooks, to have been discovered earlier by Gauss.  It was disconcerting for other mathematicians who wrote him of some new theorem or proof they had developed to have him write back that their ideas followed some he had already had, sometimes followed by a comment that they had saved him the work of polishing his ideas.  This was not idle boasting.  Gauss didn't lie.  However, in the case of Johann Bolyai, son of a mathematician friend of Gauss and developer of hyperbolic geometry, this lead to a strained relationship.  When Gauss became aware of Bolyai's invention of a non-Euclidean geometry, he didn't praise the work because it followed his own discoveries of 30 years before.  Gauss could not resolve the conflict of wanting to preserve the priority of his own work and yet also wanting to praise important work done independently.  <br />The legacy of his mathematical work -- as well as his physical studies -- is secure.  No less than Albert Einstein said that, without Gauss, there would have been no theory of relativity.<br />A good introduction to the signficance of Gauss and his work, but those who already know his work will no doubt want more about the man.	2004-01-27
US	52939892	R1V27KOWRKIA6R	0806512261	817637683	Second Variety and Other Classic Stories	Books	5	17	18	N	N	A Must for the Dick Fan and a Good Introduction to PKD	There would be little point in giving a synopsis of each of the 24 stories in this book.  That would give a false sense of repetition since many feature images of ash and overturned bathtubs -- the aftermath of nuclear war -- or struggles between mutants and normal humans, each fearing their extinction.  But they don't seem any more repetitious than a skilled musician working variations on a theme for that is what many are.  These stories, written in 1953 and 1954 -- with one exception, are arranged chronologically, so the student of Dick can see him play with an idea for two or three stories in a row.  Along the way we get the humor, intricate plotting, and sudden reversals in our moral sympathies characteristic of Dick.  And there are the machines that so often are a force of death in Dick though they behave more and more like life.  Such is the case with the title story, one of Dick's most paranoid and basis for the movie [[ASIN:0767810880 Screamers]].  When sophisticated weapons take on human guise and began to stalk man, what Dick calls his grand theme, knowing who is human and who only pretends to be, is starkly exhibited.  Other famous stories are \\"The Golden Man\\" with its purging of mutants before they infect the human gene pool, \\"The Father-Thing\\" which is what a boy realizes has replaced his real father, and \\"Sales Pitch\\", a story which anticipates, with its all purpose android advertising its virtues through rather thuggish means, the work of Ron Goulart.    There are some memorable stories not so well known.  \\"Foster, You're Dead\\" was originally conceived as a protest against a remark by President Eisenhower that citizens should be responsible for their own bomb shelters.  Its young hero lives terrified in a world where making knives from scratch and digging underground shelters are parts of the school curriculum and each new year brings the newest model of bomb shelter, terrified because his father can't afford to buy one for the family.  \\"War Veteran\\"reads like a futuristic _Mission Impossible_ episode.  The spirit of Charles Fort may be at work in \\"Null-O\\", a satire on the absurd philosophy that no distinctions between things are valid, a philosophy practiced by \\"perfect paranoids\\".  (Fort may have inspired the weakest and first story in the collection, \\"Fair Game\\", with its van Vogtian plotting giving way at the end to a silly twist.)  Dick fans will see \\"Shell Game\\", with its colony of paranoids, as sort of a test run for Dick's [[ASIN:0375719288 Clans of the Alphane Moon]], and the time jumping child of \\"A World of Talent\\" is reminiscent of Manfred Steiner in Dick's [[ASIN:0679761675 Martian Time-Slip]].  This collection also features one of Dick's occasional fantasies, \\"Upon the Dull Earth\\".  Any admirer of Dick will want to read this collection, and those needing an introduction to his work will find no bad stories in this exhibit of 14 months in Dick's career.	2004-01-14
US	52939892	R21TNK689J0X9I	1931081891	388853076	The Devils in the Details	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A Must for Fans of Powers and Blaylock	Blaylock and Powers have been collaborating for thirty years, often implicitly influencing each other and sometimes, like here, collaborating on stories with both their names on them.  Fans of either should appreciate the brief account of that collaboration in this book's afterward and introduction and, specifically, the comments on the volume's three stories.<br />As is typical for his shorter work, Powers abandons his characteristic secret histories.  In &quot;Through and Through&quot;, a weary, lukewarm priest confronts a ghost in the confessional and rethinks the power and significance of Catholic ritual.  But, if we don't get an epic combining of magic and history, Powers still works in some interesting thoughts on the Garden of Eden.    <br />The modern obsession with inclusivity on college campuses is satirized in Blaylock's &quot;The Devil in the Details&quot;.  A college president's attempt to build a Christian chapel is thwarted by forces both silly and sinister.  <br />I must admit that I appreciated and understood Powers' and Blaylock's collaboration &quot;Fifty Cents&quot; more after reading Blaylock's afterward.  But, even on the first reading, the protagonist's quest -- searching in used bookstores for a book once given to him by his dead wife -- and the odd characters he meets in his drive through the desert Southwest, kept me interested.<br />Each story gets its own introductory illustration, and Blaylock's afterword is in the form of an inserted pamphlet.<br />Collectors or fans of either of these authors will want this book not only for the stories but the accounts of a longstanding literary friendship.	2004-01-11
US	52939892	R2PZNE9LIP7YWW	0345430212	269666887	Aftershocks (Colonization, Book 3)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Seven Books, No Conclusion	For a 488 page book that seems to be the last of a seven novel series, there is little sense of closure here.  In the mid-1960s, the struggle between the alien Lizards and humans that started in 1942 still goes on in space and on Earth.  Nazi Germany is weakened, but not extinguished, in a nuclear exchange with the Lizards.  A nuclear armed Soviet Union covertly aids human insurgents in Lizard occuppied China, and America edges closer to all out nuclear war with the Lizards.  As humans begin to adopt alien technology for everything from weaponry to toys and try to establish a permanent, armed presence in space, the hidebound, traditionalist Lizards find themselves changed as well.  The addiction to ginger continues to corrode Lizard mores.  A pair of them even goes so far as to enter the perversion of marriage.  As human and Lizard warily watch each other and the aliens begin to adopt Earth-style balance of power politics, the ecosystems of each begin to clash, with flora and fauna of the Race's Homeworld outcompeting the native Earth species in desert regions.  The intermingling of two worlds is best symbolized by Kassquit, a human woman raised from birth by the Lizard, and Straha, a defector from the Lizards who finds that the ways of humans -- and especially \\"snout counting\\" Americans -- have rubbed off on him.  (The identity of Straha's human minder turns out to be one of those delightful unnamed historical cameos Turtledove loves to put in his alternate histories.)  The trouble is Turtledove doesn't settle the central conflict of this series -- how, if possible, human and Lizards can co-exist.  He just prolongs it.  At novel's end, it is hinted that the Lizards might be able to adapt legal concepts of citizenship from the Roman Empire.  However, the Lizards don't seem much closer to conquering Man.  To be sure, humans have gotten strong enough that the Lizards are reluctant to start a war.  But neither side has decisively won.  Turtledove does wrap up some of the subplots involving ginger smuggling -- and they were getting somewhat tedious at this point in the series.  But even there, while the fate of some characters is finally resolved, that of others is left sort of hanging.    The middle of the book is an amalgam of domestic concerns of romance and marriage with Cold War style nuclear brinkmanship between man and alien.  The end of the novel is a disappointing repeat of _Worldwar:  Striking the Balance_ not only in its ultimate irresolution, but it even involves an incident with the very same nuclear weapon of that novel.  In short, this book seems to be a disappointing conclusion to a promising series.	2004-01-02
US	52939892	RB61QLIWRMLCE	034544423X	851987429	American Empire: The Victorious Opposition	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Still a Worthwhile Series After Seven Books	This book, Turtledove's seventh in this particular universe, is hardly the place to jump into this series.  But, if you've read the whole series up to now, you'll want to stick with it.<br />Yes, some of Turtledove's characteristic flaws are here, notably replaying events from our history in a different geopolitical context rather than inventing a whole new sequence of events.  Thus, we get European history between the World Wars reset in a variant North America of the same time rather than postulating, say, no wars or of more limited extent.  I suspect Turtledove wanted WWI and WWII taking place in North America and built his alternate timeline to justify that.  Another flaw is frequent repetition, as if they were Homeric epithets, of characters' descriptions.  And, in this book, he's taken to parenthetically highlighting the moral blindness of some of his characters as if we wouldn't notice otherwise.<br />Yet, this series continues to hold my interest as the Confederate States of America stand-in for an aggreived Germany and Jake Featherston for Adolf Hitler.  Watching several characters being co-opted into supporting the evil, \\"victorious opposition\\" of Featherston's regime is the main interest here.<br />The moral corruption of several of the viewpoint characters as they are co-opted by Jake Featherston is disturbingly plausible.  Others, far from the South, clash violently.  Some die to be replaced in their viewpoint duties by family members.  There are a couple of unnamed historical cameos, and a suicidal Ernie aka Ernest Hemingway shows up again.<br />One story line seems a bit contrived just to get its character into trouble, and Lucien Galtier and his familial bantering still seem to have little function beyond showing us a man who has largely benefited from the Great War.<br />But the plight of Scipio, a black man trapped in Featherston's CSA, doesn't seem at all contrived, and his story is the most frightening as his past, his race, and his country threaten his life and his family's<br />As you would expect, the novel ends with the beginning of war and, no doubt, some unpleasant times ahead for all ... in the next book.	2003-12-19
US	52939892	R2U5MZ461R76R3	0803298188	12472868	The Sleeper Awakes (Bison Frontiers of Imagination)	Books	4	19	22	N	N	Good Edition for Students of Wells and SF History	Science fiction fans simply looking for an entertaining story will want to skip this book.  Its speculations, with a couple of exceptions, are dated -- Wells admitted such only ten years after it was written.  The socialist values it expounds make one wonder whether Fabian Wells would have ever been satisfied with capitalism no matter what it did.  The characters, again as Wells admitted, are Everyman and an implausible businessman villain.  And yet Wells kept playing with this story over 21 years.  It also was probably quite influential on a young Robert Heinlein, a Wells admirer.  (It has moving roadways amongst other things.)  The story?  A man wakes up from a two hundred year coma to find out he's the richest man in the world.  The capitalists who run this world hope he'll play along with them, continue to let them run the world using his money.  But Sleeper Graham has other ideas and becomes a Socialist messiah to the oppressed.  Students of science fiction's history will recognize a plot with a starting point similar to Edward Bellamy's [[ASIN:0451522249 Looking Backward: 2000-1887]] -- to which Wells gives a nod.  They'll also be interested in the understandably wrong predictions about aerial warfare.  Students of Wells will definately want to read this, one of his second-tier works.    This book is a particularly good edition because it features a useful afterword noting the many changes Wells made in this story.  It was first published as _When the Sleeper Wakes_, an 1899 magazine serial.  It was changed for the book publication of the same year and further changed for the 1910 and 1921 editions.	2003-12-17
US	52939892	R2IXRZZK8SUGIY	0929480058	924098819	Them bones	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Better Than Most Waldrop	My usual reaction to reading a Waldrop story is yes, it's obvious he did a lot of research, but what was the point, why should I care?<br />This novel has something usually lacking in Waldrop -- emotion.  It's a fast-paced, poignant read of time travelers stranded in two versions of the American Moundbuilder culture:  one from our history and one in a world where Rome lost the Second Punic War.  Waldrop does his usual thorough research, and here he actually gives us, rather than his usual bizarre juxtapositions of characters, some likeable people whose struggles and joys seem very real -- to us, the reader, but almost invisible to the archeaologists from 1929 who study some odd mounds in Louisiania.  This is a look at lives buried by time and ultimately, like all lives, capable of being seen and felt only in the imagination.<br />Waldrop fans will like this.<br />More importantly, even if you're sometimes annoyed by Waldrop, you'll like this.	2003-11-26
US	52939892	R1SFRFG431NI3V	0140114068	181024941	The Mask of Command	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Biography, History, and Something of a How To	Its title comes from a theatrical metaphor, Keegan examining what a commander chooses to reveal of himself to his troops, what he conceals, and what he sometimes invents.    But the book is much more than that.  Through an examination of the armies, times, and personalties of four commanders -- Alexander the Great, Wellington, Grant, and Hitler (with a brief look at the command style of John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missle Crisis) -- he shows us how command tactics and theatrics have evolved from Alexander's leading by example in the thick of battle, an heroic example, to the decidely unheroic and distant Hitler and Kennedy.    You'd expect, in a book like this, some look at the politics, military structure, and arms surrounding each leader.  And that's present as well as a look at the mechanics of battlefield communication.  We're also shown how each of the above leaders personifies some leadership style.     As with his [[ASIN:B000S9IMDU The Face Of Battle]], Keegan makes some of his most memorable points through telling details.  We hear of how Alexander's leadership was constricted by the dust of battle, the impossibility of directing combat while heroically hacking at the foe himself; we see how Wellington was distanced from the battlefield by cannons, his vision even more clouded by the gray smoke of guns than Alexander's was by dust, and his intuitive estimation of how fast troops could move against enemies who had just discharged a volley; Keegan talks about the importance of clear and concise dispatches in 19th century battles and how Grant and Wellington's command of English served them well off the battleground; we read transcripts of a micromanaging Hitler who had far better recall of various weapons' characteristics than his commanders but a notable deficeit in strategic thinking.      I found it interesting that all the commanders Keegan chose were political leaders, half unifying military and political commands at once, the other half pursuing political careers after their generalships were over.  He doesn't explicity say why this is so, but a concluding chapter on \\"post-heroic\\" leadership over nuclear forces implicitly argues for a new style of command by our current military-political leaders.    Whether you want a biography of any or all of the commanders studied in this book, a history of how warfare and the process of command changed through millennia, or a look at how a war leader must manipulate his followers with the right mix -- for his society and time -- of love, alienation, fear, and respect, this book is worth reading.	2003-11-26

Space exploration and colonization just isn't paying for itself.  Colonies take centuries to repay investors.  To make matters worse, some declare themselves independent of their corporate founders on Earth.  The solution?  The &quot;asset-recovery mission&quot;, legalized piracy where corporate armies swoop down on colonies to plunder them.<br />Lawrence Newton is a sergeant in such an army, and, when he gets word of an impending mission to the planet Thallspring, he starts to plan a little private asset realization of his own.  On Thallspring, we get the story of a mission frustrated by local resistance headed up by Denise Ebourn who is much more than the simple storyteller and schoolteacher she appears to be.<br />Alternating with this plot is the story of how Newton, son of corporate elite on the colony Amethi, fled his home after a bitter betrayal.  Spurred on by a beloved science fiction &quot;i-drama&quot;, he dreams of becoming a starship explorer.  Twenty years later, this exiled corporate prince is a corporate mercenary and still dreaming.  Counterpointed to Newton's adventures are Ebourn's tales, for her students, of Prince Mozark of the long dead Ring Empire and the civilizations he finds in his quest for life's purpose and what course his people should adopt.  <br />Thus the novel not only turns out to be filled with Hamilton's typically clear and exciting combat sequences and technological skullduggery but is also a look at the economic constraints on space travel and colonization, the spreading of corporate uniculture on Earth and on man's colonies, the purpose humans should find in their lives as technology advances, and the influence of science fiction's romances on our future.<br />This novel doesn't immerse you in a world as thoroughly as Hamilton's Night's Dawn series did simply because it has fewer pages, but Hamilton pays careful attention to his technology and economics.<br />And the last hundred pages of this novel will change your whole perception of what has gone before.	2003-11-23
US	52939892	R21UPC226EQMJ4	0806115386	347440563	They Called Him Wild Bill: The Life and Adventures of James Butler Hickok	Books	4	41	42	N	N	Good Introduction to a Legend	There are many figures from the American West whose lives are encrusted with legend and myth, but, with Wild Bill Hickok, the process started even before he was dead.    It was a short life, done at 39 when he was shot in the back by one Jack McCall in Deadwood, South Dakota.    In those 39 years, Hickok helped his father run a station in the Underground Railway, fought as a guerilla in Missouri, went behind enemy lines as a scout and spy in the Civil War, drove coaches and wagons, guided hunting parties, served as a detective for the U. S. government, prospected for gold, acted in a traveling stage show with Buffalo Bill Cody, gambled, and, most famously, served as a lawman in Hays and Abilene, Kansas.  During that time, he killed men and exhibited a shooting skill with revolvers unmatched at the time.      I grew up not far from Deadwood, a town that has enshrined Hickok's grave and memory, but this is the first full-length, adult biography of him I've read, and I found it a good, credible introduction to his life.    Rosa, the world's leading authority on Hickok, clearly admires Hickok, but, if he refutes the debunkers of Hickok's life, he's also generally skeptical of all the legends around Hickok.  He looks at official records, newspaper articles, memoirs, and even, when Hickok's shooting abilities are discussed, modern attempts to recreate them, to get to the truth of Wild Bill.  Rosa covers the questions of how many people Hickok killed, his weapons, his (lack of) relationship with Calamity Jane, his odd marriage to the remarkable Agnes Lake who was eleven years his senior, the extent and origin of his failing eyesight, and devotes a whole chapter to the unexplained motives of Wild Bill's murderer.  He even discusses the stories of Wild Bill's famous horse, Black Nell.  And, of course, Rosa discusses the famous gunfights in Hickok's life including the one that started the Western legend of the showdown in the middle of the street:  the killing of Dave Tutt.	2003-11-14

Like others who have actually done honest fieldwork amongst these political exotica, Ronson meets a lot of kind, polite, and charming people -- as long as you happen to be the right race or creed.  Many are reasonable and tolerant too -- at least when they don't have any power to realize their visions.    From the vast zoo of modern conspiracy theory, Ronson mostly concentrates on the ZOG/Bilderberg/Trilateralist/Satanist clade which is usually associated with the right wing.  But his years of research turn up some surprises.    In pre-September 11th London, Ronson hangs out with Omar Bakri, self-described as Osama bin Laden's man in London.  In America, we meet Thom Robb, Grand Wizard of some Klan sect in a world rife with internecine sniping, egomaniacs, and FBI informers.  His claim to fame?  He wants his disciples to follow his self-help program -- oh, and stop using the \\"N-word\\".  With Jim Tucker, reporter for the notorious and defunct _Spotlight_ newspaper, he attempts to infiltrate the annual meeting of the legendary Bilderberg Group.  Then there's ex-British sportscaster David Icke who insists that, when he talks about a conspiracy of world ruling reptilian space alien Illuminati, he really means space aliens and not Jews.    And Ronson doesn't find extremism just among the conspiracy mongerers.  The infamous actions of the U.S. government at Ruby Ridge are recounted as well as the press' general inability to see a distinction important to the Weavers and their supporters -- racial separatism as opposed to racial supremacy.  The Anti-Defamation League comes across as far too ready to see anti-Semitism and pass its faulty judgements to a gullible media.  Canadian activists try to stop Icke from public speaking -- all in the name of racial tolerance.  And when Ronson actually interviews a founding member, Denis Healey, of the Bilderbergs on their history and activities, suspicions are not entirely allayed.    Ronson makes few outright comments and judgements on his subjects, provides no grand summing up of his findings and that may be the book's biggest flaw.  The closest he gets is the concluding statement that nobody really controls anything.  The book is more reportage than analysis.  But that reporting is done with a sharp eye for the humorous and sinister.  Bakri tells of what a future Islamic London will be like -- and is chided at a meeting of fellow jihadists about his inept fishing.  Who is the man following Tucker and Ronson in Portugal during the Bilderberg meeting?  Hollywood, a claimed nexus of the Grand Jewish Conspiracy, comes off as petty, apolitical, and a place of insincere boutique faith as Ronson follows Tony Kaye, director of [[ASIN:6305313687 American History X]], around.  Klansmen argue the merits of silk or cotton robes.  Ronson infiltrates the Bohemian Grove -- attended by U. S. presidents and vice-presidents -- and finds a rather silly, decades old frat boy ritual that just doesn't have the same drawing power it used to among the up-and-coming junior world ruler set.  And more than once, Ronson, a Jew, finds himself guiltily associating with anti-Semites.     To be sure, some of the books chapters seem extraneous.  An auction of Nicolae Ceausescu's relics adds nothing.  Neither does a chapter on Ian Paisley taken from an early newspaper article.     Ronson's book reminded me of Phillip Finch's  [[ASIN:0399310126 God Guts And Guns]] which went among the American radical right and the works of Laird Wilcox about American political extremists.  Its humor and willingness to consider outre theories like David Icke's reminded me of Alex Heard's [[ASIN:0385498527 Apocalypse Pretty Soon: Travels In End-Time America]], the work of Ronson's fellow Englishman Louis Theroux, and the pages of _The Fortean Times_.     Anybody interested in strange beliefs, conspiracy theories, or political extremism should read this book.	2003-10-23
US	52939892	R1OD2NMCOB9JNH	0671319531	131130866	Borderlands of Science: How to Think Like a Scientist and Write Science Fiction	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Good Introduction to the Major Areas of Modern Science	There are two primary audiences for this work.  The first is anybody interested in understanding a wide variety of scientific topics.  Though not as thorough and wide ranging as Isaac Asimov's science guides, Sheffield writes with the same clarity and and his own style of wit.  Even somebody who regularly reads popular science magazines may find some new insight here.<br />Sheffield delves into the origins of life, subnuclear and quantum physics, possible mechanisms for space travel, physical descriptions of the solar system, superconductivity, viruses and prions, and a lot more including a whole section on \\"scientific heresies\\".<br />The second audience are those interested in writing science fiction, specifically the sort of hard science fiction Sheffield wrote.  To suggest story ideas, Sheffield explores some of the borders of modern science where conventional theory gives way to speculation.  Along the way, he points out some common traps to avoid when handling topics like near lightspeed travel and suggests specific fiction titles as examples of how a concept has been dealt with.  He does not offer any advice on the literary aspects of science fiction or in marketing it.  His sole interest is in helping you get your real science right and make your imaginary science plausible.<br />While the book doesn't have a whole lot about the thought processes of scientists, Sheffield does cover the historical and contemporary objections to some scientific theories, the prejudices that sometimes blind good scientists, and some of the amazing minds that have roamed across several disciplines.<br />Admirers of Sheffield's fiction will also probably like the asides about its scientific inspiration.<br />My only objection to the book is that I wish some sections would have had more detail.<br />The book includes a useful bibliography of fact and fiction titles for further research and an index.	2003-10-06
US	52939892	RLCHVABME25SN	0812580311	370216473	Dark as Day (Cold As Ice)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A Fine End -- or Entrance -- to This Series	Those returning to the universe of Sheffield's _Cold As Ice_ and _The Ganymede Club_ will be pleased to find their old friend Bat here.  The reclusive, snoopy genius has exiled himself to a moon of  Saturn.  Unfortunately, his home on Pandora figures in the plans of the ruthless and pushy Ligon family who want to reverse their recent slide from third to tenth in the rankings of richest companies in the solar system.   <br />Reluctantly involved in their plot is Alex Ligon, sort of the black sheep of the family.  When not being bullied  by his family into running errands -- or auditioning for arranged marriages -- he works for the government rather than Ligon Industries.  He's proud of a vast, sophisticated computer model of the entirety of human civilization in the solar system -- until it shows mankind going extinct in less than a century.  Bad modelling or a ominous and valid warning?<br />Meanwhile, young Millie Wu has signed on to work for one half of the Beston brothers -- aka the Bastard and the Ogre, SETI researchers whose obsession about finding alien signals is matched only by their obsession with besting each other.  Wu can't quite believe her luck when she seems to have detected a genuine signal.<br />On Earth, Janeed Jannex and her childhood friend Sebastian Birch decide to emigrate to space, but their recruiters prove to surprisingly be interested in Birch's almost idiot savant fascination with, of all things, clouds.<br />Those familiar with Sheffield's previous work will expect these plotlines to converge, and, as with _Cold As Ice_, the surprises are less in the sometimes predictable plot twists than the why of events or their scientific explanation.  Those who found the ideas of that novel interesting will also appreciate this one.  Sheffield gives us a system wide internet, the Seine, that communicates instantaneously via quantum entanglement.  There is the mining of methane deposits on the floors of Earth's oceans, and a fairly detailed explanation of how an alien radio signal would be analysed and decoded.  Even if Sheffield engages in a bit of handwaving with his explanations of Alex Ligon's computer model, it is still interesting.  <br />Readers new to this series should have no trouble jumping right in with this book, and those who have read the other two novels will find little amplifications of previous plots points -- including Bat's growing collection of weapons from the Great War.	2003-10-02
US	52939892	R3SPHNCYW1R0XG	0812544609	761825448	The Ganymede Club	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Same Universe as Cold As Ice, Different Feel	It's five years after the Great War that killed nine billion people in the Solar System, but violence hasn't ceased.  It's just returned to the traditional forms of individual murder for profit and paranoia.<br />The targets in question are haldane Lola Belman, a therapist trained in the aracana of the mathematical underpinnings of the brain, psychotropic drugs, and medicine, and her patient who seems to be suffering a severe bout of false memories.  <br />Unlike its prequel _Cold As Ice_, there are not a lot of neat scientific concepts here.  The plot is not driven by scientific exploration and corporate and political intrigue but mostly by the suspense of the characters trying to figure out things the reader knows already, specifically who's trying to kill them and why.  And those characters are generally a more interesting lot than those in the earlier novel.  The only overlap in the cast is with the best character:  the Bat, an obese and extremely private genius who delights in solving all sorts of puzzles from scheduling conflicts in the spaceship transportation network to murder.  Here we see him twenty years earlier in his career.<br />Essentially, if you like a good, suspenseful science fiction tale with a bit of hard science, this novel is for you.  Sheffield has created, in these books, a universe of adventure, discovery, and intrigue about 90 years in the future.  Each stands alone, and the books can be read in any order.	2003-09-23
US	52939892	R39TWU5G470IEN	1565041577	841273071	The Road to Science Fiction 5	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The Classic Series Continues	Several novels are excerpted here.  And one prominent one isn't:  Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ which Gunn argues is a transition from the gothic but not yet fully in the camp of self-aware science fiction.  Lt. Col. Sir George Tomkyns Chesney's _The Battle of Dorking_ is the first of those future war novels written by politicians and military men determined to influence public policy.  Edwin A. Abbott's  _Flatland_, still in print, is a charming tale of life and culture in a two-dimensional world.  That incomparable giant of science fiction, Olaf Stapledon, is represented by a selection from _Star Maker_, narrated by a \\"cosmical mind\\" who views the life of the universe.  (Though oddly, in this volume, Gunn barely mentions his importance to the genre.  For that, you must consult volume two.)  The title for the section on Richard Jeffries _After London; Or, Wild England_ is \\"The Craving for Catastrophe\\".  It is a pastoral tale of a simpler life after an unexplained disaster has befallen the country.    That craving shows up in several more tales.  Killer smog hits the city in Robert Barr's 1892 story \\"The Doom of London.\\"  \\"The Great Fog\\" of H. F. Heard wipes out worldwide civilization.  Life gets extinguished on an alien planet in Arthur C. Clarke's much anthologized \\"The Star.\\"  \\"The Nature of the Catastrophe\\" in Michael Moorcock's story of that name is never really explained.  An amalgam of newspaper excerpts and fiction, this story unfortunately shares the oblique prose and loose setting of his Jerry Cornelius novels.  Not readable in its own right, it still gives you some idea of Moorcock's influence on the New Wave.  Tanith Lee's \\"Written in Water\\" is a last woman on Earth tale.  The world that may be destroyed by an artist in J. D. Beresford \\"A Negligible Experiment\\" is our own.  The disaster of  John Wyndham's \\"The Emptiness of Space\\" is a personal one.  Its hero has survived a spell in cryonic suspension and fears his soul has left his body.    As you wouldexpect, the anthology is full of several famous names.  Not only are J. G. Ballard and Brian W. Aldiss present in earlier installments of this series, but they also are the only authors to get two stories in this volume.  Ballard is represented by \\"The Voices of Time\\" (more disaster) and \\"The Drowned Giant\\".  They serve as a good introduction to his passive protagonists and landscape motifs.  If you don't like Ballard, these will do nothing to sway your opinion.  The more versatile Aldiss has the witty \\"Working in the Spaceship Yards\\" and the decidedly downbeat \\"Appearance of Life\\" -- both in their own way dealing with problems of communication in the human species.  Genre critic and defender Kingsley Amis shows up with the rather trite, but stylish, \\"Mason's Life\\", a short short story about the reality of some's dreams.  Anthony Burgess works a new twist on the old cliche of a hack writer ripping off a famous writer via a time machine in \\"The Muse.\\"    An interesting famous name is Rudyard Kipling who only wrote two science fiction stories though Gunn argues that his narrative techniques were so ahead of their time that, had he written more, he would be called the father of science fiction.  Indeed, Kipling's \\"As Easy as A. B. C.\\" is a bit too modern since his exposition is slick and glib and a bit obscure.  Written in 1912, it wouldn't have seemed out of date in the 1950s.  As for Wells, he is represented by his famous \\"In the Country of the Blind.\\"      The second tier of fame, names already fading from the public mind, is well represented.  Eric Frank Russell's \\"Hobbyist\\" puts a crashed scoutship on a planet with a frighteningly omnipotent and mysterious alien.  John Brunner's \\"The Totally Rich\\" postulate that the rich really aren't like you and me.  One hires a man to resurrect a lover from psychic traces he left on his environment.  \\"The Happiest Day of Your Life\\" by Bob Shaw shows the downside of a really efficient educational system.  James White puts his tailoring experience to good use in \\"Custom Fitting\\".  It shows the importance of being properly dressed no matter the occasion or species.  Christopher Priest's \\"An Infinite Summer\\" is about the havoc wrecked on one man's life by mysterious tourists who \\"freeze\\" people's lives for varying periods.  Ian Watson's \\"The Great Atlantic Swimming Race\\" is the newest story in the book, but its satire on those great fundraising events of the 1980s like Live Aid already seems a bit dated.    Gunn rescues other names from obscurity.  \\"A Corner in Lightning\\" by George Griffith outlines the dangers of trying to horde electricity.  S. Fowler Wright's \\"The Rat\\" is a rumination on the dangers of immortality being bestowed on humans.  \\"Mouth of Hell\\" by David I. Masson doesn't really go anywhere but most of it is an interesting exploration of alien geography.  \\"The Power of Time\\" by Josephine Saxton is a neglected classic about a really ambitious construction project:  relocating New York City to England.  The characters of M. John Harrison's \\"Settling the World\\" set out to assassinate God.  D. G. Compton's \\"It's Smart to Have an English Address\\" has a musician not at all comfortable with someone recording not only his performance but the sensations of performing.     There are several good stories in this anthology that are rarely anthologized.  Arthur Conan Doyle's 1913 story \\"The Horror of the Heights\\" anticipates some of the work of Charles Fort.  Peter Phillips' \\"Dreams Are Sacred\\" is at the head of a long line of stories where people enter the dreams of others to manipulate their symbols and restore the dreamer to sanity.  \\"Made in the U. S. A.\\" is a slick 1953 story from J. T. McIntosh about Freudian psychology, divorce, and androids.  Brian Stableford's \\"And He Busy Not Being Born\\" has a protagonist who is bothered enough about the prospect of his inevitable demise that he does something about it -- and becomes transformed.	2003-09-02
US	52939892	RVFX5S55N7LD8	0743435672	2067533	Resurgence	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Best of the Heritage Universe Series	In the fifth novel of the Heritage Universe, the Builders, those aliens who scattered around huge, occasionally useful, sometimes deadly, artifacts about our part of the galaxy, have competition.  Another force is destroying their work and sucking the heat and life out of entire solar systems.<br />Troubleshooter Hans Rebka, obsessed Builder scholar Darya Lang, the shady team of Louis Nenda and Atvar H'sial, their strangely loyal slaves, the exuberant and impatient E. C. Tally (an embodied computer), and Ethical Counselor Julian Graves again find themselves exploring the Builders' works and speculating as to what they mean.<br />This may be the most humorous book of the series, and the characters are at their most interesting.  The action set pieces in frozen solar systems are inventive and suspenseful.<br />This is not a good entry point for the series, though.  You'll want to follow the enigma of the Builders from the beginning starting with Sheffield's _Convergent Series_ and then _Transvergence_.  <br />And, unfortunately, with Sheffield's death last year, some Builder questions will remain unanswered.	2003-07-29
US	52939892	R3MEREQIN7FSGD	0061059013	988155661	Year's Best SF 3	Books	4	10	10	N	N	A Good Batch of Stories	The one piece of dross comes from an unexpected source: William Gibson and his story \\"Thirteen Views of a Cardboard City\\". It's a minute, camera-eye examination of a cardboard structure in a Tokyo subway and obviously inspired by J.G. Ballard's work. I detected no point to the series of descriptions, or, indeed, anything of a fantastical or science fictional nature.<br />Nancy Kress' \\"Always True to Thee, in My Fashion\\" gives us a witty satire with a world where the seasonal variations of fashion cover not only clothes but also your pharmaceutically modulated attitudes.. The caged dinosaur of Gene Wolfe's \\"Petting Zoo\\" represents not only the lost childhood of the story's protagonist but a vitality lost from the race of man. Tom Cool gives us \\"Universal Emulators\\" with its future of economic hypercompetition that has created a black market for those who impersonate, in every way, the few employed professionals. In effect, the emulators grant them an extra set of hands. Its plot and characters would have done Roger Zelazny proud.<br /><br />The voice of  past science fiction writers echos through many of the anthology's best stories. Jack London's  [[ASIN:0486411087 The Sea-Wolf (Dover Thrift Editions)]] provides the inspiration for Michael Swanwick's \\"The Wisdom of Old Earth\\". Its heroine realizes, despite whatever dangers she overcomes guiding posthumans through the Pennsylvania's jungles, she will never bootstrap herself into being their equal. H.G. Wells looms over Robert Silverberg's \\"Beauty in the Night\\".  Its child hero undertakes the first successful assassination of the brutal aliens that have occupied Earth, but his reasons have more to do with his oppressive father rather than the aliens' behavior. John C. Wright's \\"Guest Law\\" is a welcome return to the flashy decadence of Cordwainer Smith's fiction. Its hero, a slave-engineer, watches in disgust as his aristocratic overlords corrupt the customary requirements of hospitality to justify piracy in deep space. Gregory Benford's \\"The Voice\\" responds to Ray Bradbury's [[ASIN:B004SCQSFW Fahrenheit 451]]. Here the convenience of implanted intelligent agents, hooked up to a computer network, led to literacy fading, and not a repressive regime of firemen. Benford agrees with Bradbury about literacy's value but also undercuts him on the supremacy of writing as a means of communication.<br /><br />James Patrick Kelly and Brian Stableford tackle similar themes in two excellent tales about children, the needs they fufill for parents, and the possiblity of replacing them with surrogates. The heroine of Kelly's \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider\\", estranged from her actor father for 23 ages, is horrified to discover that her enfeebled father's legal guardian is also equipped to simulate her as a child. Stableford's \\"The Pipes of Pan\\" has a future recovering from ecological catastrophe where real children are not allowed. However, parents can have children genetically altered to never age and reproduce. But those  children suddenly start growing up.<br /><br />Jack Williamson's \\"The Firefly Tree\\" is a Bradbury-like tale of aliens who travel far but whose invitation to join an intergalactice republic goes no further than a farm boy. Though I usually hate stories narrated by smart-alecky teenagers, I didn't mind S.N. Dyer's \\"The Nostalginauts\\" with its problem of time travelers going back 25 years to reminisce about their younger selves. The technological speculations of Greg Egan's \\"Yeyuka\\" are interesting. However, I didn't find the political criticisms inherent in this story of First World companies exploiting the misery of a Third World cancer epidemic that convincing or plausible, and they seemed a bit of a repeat of those in his novel [[ASIN:B00E83OQVE Distress]]. While Terry Bisson's \\"An Office Romance\\" was fun and poked fun at, in passing, Microsoft and those who find the computer screen a satisfying substitute for the world outside, its romance, in the bowels of a computer system, reminded me of [[ASIN:B0060D35BC TRON The Original Classic (1982)]] in that both stories borrowed computer terminology to create a cyberverse that only superficially resembles the real thing.<br /><br />Inspiring two works in this book, Ray Bradbury also puts in a direct appearance with \\"Mr. Pale\\". As to be expected with Bradbury, its superficial science fiction trappings clothe a fantasy tale of a doctor encountering a desperate Death aboard a spaceship.<br /><br />The abrupt ending of Tom Purdom's \\"Canary Land\\" is at odds with what, at first, seems a tale of corporate espionage on the moon. However, Purdom's real story centers around the bitter experiences of an American immigrant to an Asian dominated lunar society and how his life replays the themes of past immigrants. R. Garcia y Robertson's \\"Fair Verona\\" features a virtual-reality obsessed hunting guide who discovers that the joys of his Renaissance Verona might not live up to rescuing a real damsel in danger of being murdered. Kim Newman's \\"Great Western\\" has some problems. Rather than just examine the real effects of an alteration to past events, it seeks to gain some signifcance by throwing together a mishmash of non-contemporenous events and cultural icons. Here we have mad cow disease, British political disputes about privatization, and the aftermath of a war fought to free England's serfs. Newman makes the whole thing readable by using the plot of the movie and novel [[ASIN:0553271105 Shane]], but it doesn't say anything interesting about culture or history.<br /><br />Paul Levinson's \\"The Mendelian Lamp Case\\" has a great premise: a forensic scientist encountering a centuries-old battle between groups that practice genetic engineering via old practices of selective breeding. However, while the biological speculations are detailed and interesting, Levinson should have provided more details about the Amish genetic engineers and their foes. It would have been nice to know their exact motives for spreading allergies,disease, and general social unrest. Michael Moorcock's \\"London Bone\\" has plenty of interesting details about London geography and history.  However, I think a little too much of the cantankerous Moorcock showed through in its complaints about British and American culture.<br />The anthology also has a couple of humorous stories. \\"Turnover\\", by Geoffrey A. Landis centers around a real scientific question about the seemingly uniform age of Venus' craters. Katherine MacLean's puzzling, but somewhat funny, \\"Kiss Me\\" involves several questions about frogs, including what happens when you kiss them.	2003-07-29
US	52939892	R23Z1WH86ECO1W	0309085497	220623865	Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	A Pleasing Trip Through a Small Part of Math Land	\\"This isn't magic. There's a reason this stuff works,\\" my high school math teacher used to say. Of course, there are some contentions, hypotheses, in math where we don't know if they work, if they are true.<br />For professional mathematicians, one of the most important of these is the Riemann Hypothesis. Everlasting fame amongst mathematicians, and, incidentally, a million dollars is waiting for the person who can nail the truth of the \\"RH\\" down.<br />Unlike some famous math problems, the gist of the RH is not readily apparent to most non-mathematicians. Derbyshire has to spend some time explaining what is meant by \\"All non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part one-half.\\" And, as someone whose formal math instruction ended with four years of high school math and who reads the very occasional popular math book by Gleick, Peterson, or Paulos, I'm pretty much the target audience Derbyshire pitches that explanation to.<br />The book's style reminded me of the science histories of James Burke. But where Burke's work is a pinball version of history, caroming from person to person, theory to theory, Derbyshire's is a train of mathematical explanation covering the work leading up to, and proceeding from, the RH. Occasionally, Derbyshire stops at some station, pulls up the blind, and looks at some area of tangential interest: famous mathematicians including Gauss, Hilbert, Russell, Dyson, and Turing (who thought RH untrue and attempted to build a computing device to disprove it); German educational reforms of the early 19th century; the Cambridge Five spies; and, most often, since this book is ostensibly a biography of him, the life of Bernhard Riemann. But it's not long before we're back on that math train again. This is not to shortchange the non-math interludes of the book. Derbyshire's quick asides gave me a lot of ideas for further reading. And, if less than half of the book's 422 pages cover Riemann's life, you still get some idea of his protean mind so important not only to mathematics but modern physics.<br />Derbyshire's claim that, if you don't understand the RH after he explains it you never will, seems credible. I won't claim I immediately followed his chain of explanations the first time around. But that had more to do with trying to read this book in 15 minute intervals over a week rather than Derbyshire's prose. Upon reviewing many sections again, things became clearer.<br />The book briefly notes some of the consequences of RH, practical and theoretical. A lot of math is based on the assumption it's true. And the RH may have some mysterious relation to the world of quantum physics. In the commercial and military worlds, where encryption methods based on prime numbers are important, the RH, which has to do with the distribution of primes, may have significant importance if proved true.<br />I think one of the best things about this book is that, briefly, in a simple way, a non-mathematician like me can get some small idea of the excitement mathematicians feel upon discovering some curious pattern in the world of numbers. <br />The only complaint I have with this book is its format. Is it too much to ask that, in the age of computerized typesetting and with an author whose footnotes are all worth reading, that we put those footnotes at the bottom of the relevant page and not at the end of the book?	2003-05-31
US	52939892	R1UTRQWHFSW05P	0886779081	416545254	Far Frontiers	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Mostly Old Plots Well Done	Built around a liberal definition of frontiers, this anthology of original stories not only has stories about space exploration and life on harsh colony worlds but also stories about death and dreams and transformation.  None of the stories break new ground, but most keep you entertained as they roam around old plots.<br />Two stories hold little interest.  &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; by Janet Pack handles the details of its technology plausibly and realistically, but, at this point in time, a story about using nanotechnology just to remove a brain tumor seems stale.  &quot;Home World&quot; by Marc Bilgrey features the old story of a frontier couple threatened with the encroachment of the civilization they originally fled.<br />The vast bulk of the stories are entertaining examples of old ideas well done.  It was nice to see geology, a little used science in science fiction, providing the clues to an alien artifact in Kathleen M. Massie-Ferch's &quot;Traces&quot;.  While conducting her researches, the heroine also has to avoid persecution by the theocratic government she lives under.  It has already imprisoned her ex-husband for insisting man is not the universe's sole intelligence.  Robert J. Sawyer's &quot;Star Light, Star Bright&quot; is one of those stories where the inhabitants of an artificial world, here a Dyson sphere, realize that man did not evolve there.  Its charm derives from the clues they use to deduce this.  The &quot;Chauna&quot; of Alan Dean Foster's similiarly titled story are mythic creatures inhabiting deep space, and a legendary inventor and mogul, enfeebled and dying, leads a resentful crew on a quest to find them.  Terry D. England's &quot;Out of the Cradle&quot; was a fun, sometimes humorous story, about a connoisseur of death, or, more accurately, the pain involved in his elaborate, repeated suicides.  His siblings wish he would put such adolescent activities behind and upload his mind to the TerraSphere, a virtual environment inhabited bymost of humanity's intellects.  He has other ideas, though.  The frontier of dream research is the subject of Kristine Kathryn Rusch's &quot;Dreamlike States&quot;. Its protagonist embarks on a disasterous project to synchronize his dream with those of his twin brother.  Lawrence Watt-Evans' &quot;The Last Bastion&quot; reminded me a bit of Vernor Vinge's work, specifically A FIRE UPON THE DEEP.  A coalition of human groups has to negotiate with the Link, a human-computer interface originally created by humanity and now at war with them.  But both sides now need a peace because research by the Link has spawned new enemies for both.  &quot;Forgotten&quot; by Peter Schweighofer doesn't try to rationalize its ending, but its main attraction is the study of those abandoned in nursing homes, here a futuristic one in orbit around a gas giant.  Julie E Czerneda's &quot;Down on the Farm&quot; offers the unusual proposition of an agricultural boot camp through which all of a colony world's immigrants must go.  They're annoyed by its stress on primitive, labor intensive methods, but, at story's end, hidden reasons for the camp are revealed.<br />Two adventure stories offer little novelty but still keep the pages turning:  Andre Norton's &quot;Set in Stone&quot; and Robin Wayne Bailey's &quot;Angel on the Outward Side&quot;.  The Norton tale features a slave and his masters confronting, on an exploratory mission, an alien and hostile intelligence.  Bailey's tale gives us a Shakespeare-quoting, android pacificst and his decidedly non-pacificistic partner, one of those mercenaries with a dead family and a whole lot of enemies who want his head.  Here he meets an old love who hires him to find her lost sister.  Nothing special in the plot pieces, but the team of North and Yoru were entertaining enough that I'd like to see them in other adventures.<br />The gem of the collection is Jane Lindskold's &quot;Ruins of the Past&quot;.  Full of plot surprises, good characterization, andhumor at just the right moments, it tells of a woman desperately fleeing creditors who want to force her into lifetime indentured servitude.  Hoping for quick cash, she climbs a mountain holding alien ruins at its summits, ruins which few return from.  There an android waits to kill her.  But the android has other needs, and a third presence lurks nearby.<br />With the exception of this Lindskold piece, this is collection of comfortably worn old plots well told.  You won't be sorry you read it.  But most of the stories won't stick in your mind either.	2001-05-19
US	52939892	R435S25T0LNNG	0886778948	493221730	Star Colonies	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Mostly Bland Stories with a Few Gems	Exploring and colonizing the stars is the theme, a classic science fiction idea.  But only a couple of stories here have any chance of becoming classics.  Many are bland and mediocre.<br />Two classic science fiction tales, A.E. van Vogt's &quot;Far Centaurus&quot; and Arthur C. Clarke's &quot;The Sentinel, provide the inspiration for a mediocre story and a bland story.  The mediocre one is Robert J. Sawyer's &quot;The Shoulders of Giants&quot; with a starship racing to a frontier already settled by humanity.  The bland story is Eric Kotani's &quot;Edgeworld&quot; with its discovery of an alien artifact.<br />Also on the bland side are Jack Williamson's &quot;Eden Star&quot;, with family conflicts played out on a planet with light-worshipping aliens, and Edo van Belkom's &quot;Coming of Age&quot; about colonists who discover that their children are doomed to permanent pre-pubescence.  The weakest story, in terms of originality, is the entirely predictable &quot;Full Circle&quot; by Mike Resnick and Kristine Kathryn Rusch.  Even humor can not save this old plot about futilely trying to get rid of one noxious pest by importing another.  <br />On the marginally interesting edge of the spectrum are Paul Levinson's &quot;The Suspended Fourth&quot;, about a planet where birdsong may hold the key to avoiding disasters, and Alan Dean Foster's &quot;The Muffin Migration&quot;, another of those stories where colonists rue ignoring the natives' advice about the local fauna.  Dana Stabenow's &quot;No Place Like Home&quot; has a few plot holes but its black humor and mean-spiritedness make up for it in a tale weighing the relative values of human life and that of alien bacteria.  <br />Both Allen Steele's &quot;The Boid Hunt&quot; and Tom Piccirilli's &quot;I Am a Graveyard Hated by the Moon&quot; are character centered stories.  The Steele tale is a deadly coming of age story and an examination of courage before and during a hunt for alien predators.  Piccirilli's mixture of virtual reality, nanotechnology, characters who think they're gods, and landscapes haunting characters doesn't quite work but is an enjoyable story reminiscent of Roger Zelazny.<br />Peter Ullian's &quot;The Vietnamization of Centauri V&quot; is not a strict retelling of the Vietnam War on an alien world but, rather, how three soldiers are differently affected by the carnage around them to which they sometimes contribute, sometimes balk at.  Its plot may not be that original, but it rings psychologically true.<br />The best stories of the anthology, both very much worth reading and both sharing settings from their authors' novels, are Robert Charles Wilson's &quot;The Dryad's Wedding&quot; and Pamela Sargent's &quot;Dream of Venus&quot;.  Set on the same planet as the setting for his BIOS, &quot;The Dryad's Wedding&quot; features a woman's whose memories and personality were re-set by a trauma that almost killed her when she was sixteen.  Nineteen years later she is set to again marry her old husband.  Wandering the planet Isis, with its ecosystem lethal to any one not genetically engineered to live there, she has began to notice some strange things . . . like a mound of talking spiders.  Set in the same universe as her trilogy about terraforming Venus, Sargent's &quot;Dream of Venus&quot; is about the conflict between artistic integrity and political realities.  Rich, aimless, and young Hassan hopes producing a propagandistic &quot;mind-tour&quot; on the Venus project will be a ladder to the kind of Earth-side job his father wants for him.  He's partnered with brilliant Miriam, a poor woman from the North America provinces.  She has something different in mind other than a simple celebration of the centuries-long terraforming project.  <br />This collection is worth reading despite the bland and predictable tales.  There are enough interesting, if flawed, stories here, and a couple of very good ones, to make it worthwhile.	2001-05-16
US	52939892	R1P9DELVTEPASP	0812580281	854473928	Genesis	Books	4	16	18	N	N	A True Tragedy of the Future	In the far future, humans only inhabit the stars as personality simulations, subroutines in vast, powerful artificial intelligencies that form a \\"galactic brain\\".  One such uploaded mind is Christian Brannock.  As an engineer, he helped build the first great works in space and was one of the first to work in intimate symbiosis with the AIs who, rather than man,  colonized the stars.  On Earth, the reigning intelligence is Gaia, a computer that rules human affairs and also posseses, in its libraries, presevered human minds it uses to ruin elaborate simulations of real and alternate histories.    Millions of years pass in this novel's almost Stapledonian sweep, and the galactic brain becomes concerned about the seeming obsession of Gaia with Earth history, her secretiveness, and her unresponsiveness to their proposal on whether the now geologically ancient Earth should be saved from a bloated sun, a test run for greater galactic engineering to come.  A version of the Brannock mind is copied and sent on his way to Earth.    There he, and a slightly different copy, attempt to figure out what Gaia's up to.  One version, inhabiting a robot's body, explores the dying Earth.  The other engages in talk and travel with Lucinda Ashcroft, a personality inhabiting Gaia.    This novel puts together, in a surprisingly successful way, just about all the strains of Anderson's previous works from the epic sweep of [[ASIN:0575070994 Tau Zero (SF Collector's Edition) (Gollancz SF collector's edition)]]to his heroic fantasy to the uploaded minds of some of his most recent science fiction to alternate histories and time travel.  The novel's sense of true tragedy is not new to Anderson, but, as the title hints, there is an unexpected theological flavor that is rare, but not unknown, in his work.      This novel should not only satisfy any fan of Anderson's but also serve as a good introduction to the rest of his work.	2001-04-08

The only other translation of [[ASIN:B000OCSJXO Beowulf]] I'm familiar with is the Burton Raffel one which I've read three times and still prefer to Heaney's.  However, not knowing Old English, I can't say which is more accurate.  Raffel does try to preserve the structure of Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse while Heaney, as he notes in his introduction, never feels compelled to strictly follow that form though he does quite a bit.    However, I suspect many readers may find that old verse form strange, awkward, and a bit offputting, and, for them, this version of the old epic is probably the best.  I always found the last third of the epic the most moving and melancholy, and, there, Heaney's translation is as powerful as Raffel's.	2001-03-17
US	52939892	R15EK3LJW94XQ8	0674076087	63813983	The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression	Books	5	36	42	N	N	You Say You Want a Revolution?	As the Beatles' song goes on to say, \\"If you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, those who blatantly profess their allegiance to communism still get seated at the polite tables of civilization.  This book provides plenty of evidence why the communist should be afforded even less sympathy in civil society than the professed fan of Adolf Hitler. Indeed, amongst other startling revelations in this book is that Nazi death camps were partially modelled on Soviet labor camps.<br /><br />To be sure the subtitle, \\"Crimes, Terror, Repression,\\" refers to a horrifying, sometimes mind-numblingly long list of tortures, familiar and unfamiliar, to the body and spirit, and the 700 plus pages of text are not a pleasant read.  Still, this book is a valuable.<br /><br />For starters, it refutes a propaganda point that communist governments, particularly the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, liked to use: that they were the bulwark against fascism.  Not only did the USSR, in a non-aggression pact, collude with Hitler, but it actively killed fellow anti-fascists in Spain and before and during its war with Hitler.  As the book documents, communist parties the world over habitually killed fellow communists who deviated from the necessary purity, and they also killed those who struggled with them against colonial powers in Southeast Asia and against Batista's dictatorship in Cuba.  The communists in Russia, after the 1917 revolution, killed more political opponents in two month's than the Czar did in 80 years.<br /><br />Though it's not the first to do so, the book documents that the Russian experiment in communism was not some relatively peaceful affair launched by Lenin and betrayed by a bloodthirsty Stalin.  To be sure, the paranoid Stalin launched immense purges, forced labor projects, and engineered famines, but terror was a principle embraced and practiced from the beginning by Lenin.<br /><br />The book also refutes the commonly recited falsehood that Mao bettered the average Chinese's lot.  His policies directly led to perhaps the greatest famine in history, and he was not above conducting his own purges.<br />Most of these crimes against their supposed beneficiaries are documented not only through secondary histories but also primary sources of survivor accounts and government documents.<br /><br />The book is divided into sections covering communism in five different manifestations:  Soviet, Eastern European, Asian, the Third World, and attempts to foster international revolution via the Comintern and terrorism.  China and Russia get several chapters each but most other countries that had communist regimes get at least one chapter.  The book draws two general distinctions between the communism of Asia and the Soviet Union and its satellites.  The Soviet model emphasized political murder of its opponents and citizens (though it was willing to simply exploit them as economic assets in labor camps).  While China also has labor camps and a history of bloody repressions against its citizens, it also developed a program of trying to change the mind of its citizens as well as compel obediance through terror.  The Khmer Rouge model, built by the secretive Pol Pot, combined the worst of both:  idealogical reprogramming and murder.<br /><br />To be sure, if you're not familiar with the history of some of the covered countries, the relevant chapters seem like a collection of strange names and obscure events.  This is particlarly true of the sections on Eastern Europe where the authors assume a certain knowledge of the background politics and figures.  On the other hand, the book is genuinely informative even to someone like me, a neophyte, in its chapters on communist politics in Afghanistan and Ethiopia.  Not only are communist crimes there covered but the background history is also explained well.<br /><br />The chapter on NKVD death squads in Spain is not the firstrevelation of their activities but does serve as a good summary.<br />This book was originally published in France, and the introduction, added for the American edition, talks about its fallout there where a politican's and intellectual's previous relationship to communism can have some real effects on his public reception.  The final chapter tries to answer the question on whether terror was a principle of communism from the beginning.  Communists at the beginning of the twentieth century did not generally preach using terror as a tool to utopia.  Indeed, communism was a formerly recognized political philosophy accorded legitimacy via officially recognized and tolerated parties in several countries before the Russian Revolution.  The book seems to blame Lenin and Russia's tradition of political violence for the brutal turn communism took.<br /><br />Several of the authors are interested in the question of whether ex-communists in Eastern Europe should be punished and, if so, how.<br /><br />What the book is starkly lacking is an attack on the practiciality of communism as an organizing economic principle.  I suspect this is not only because it is outside the book's intended scope but also because, as alluded to in the introduction, some of the editors may sympathize with the proclaimed ends of communism.<br /><br />The book also fails to mention the failed medieval experiments in communism, many of them violent, covered in Norman Cohn's classic [[ASIN:0195004566 The Pursuit of the Millennium: Revolutionary Millenarians and Mystical Anarchists of the Middle Ages, Revised and Expanded Edition]].revelation of their activities but does serve as a good summary.<br />This book was originally published in France, and the introduction, added for the American edition, talks about its fallout there where a politican's and intellectual's previous relationship to communism can have some real effects on his public reception.

US	52939892	R1WGDJE14CGTLF	0890963444	162894410	Disaster in Korea: The Chinese Confront Macarthur (Texas A&m University Military History Series)	Books	4	20	20	N	N	Book's Strength and Weakness Is in Its Details	Roy Appleman started working on this book when he was a combat historian in the US Army during the Korean War and continued into the 80s.  By examining military records and interviewing many of the participants at all levels, he brings a great deal of detail to bear on a narrow focus:  the experiences of the United States Eighth Army (with attached Turkish, British, and South Korean units) in the Korean War from November 24th, 1950 to December 26th,1950.<br />That detail can be mindnumbing at times, especially for a life-long civilian like me.  A large portion of this book is taken up with such details as when x platoon detached from Company Y to occupy Hill Z.  Appleman tries to be as clear as possible and substitutes organizing his history around units for a straight chronological telling of events.  On occasion, he stops to remind us what is happening elsewhere simultaneous to the events he is covering or backtracks to place things in context.  There are plenty of maps, many of them detailed, but the book could have used even more.<br />The book doesn't start to get really interesting until about half way through when Appleman takes up the harrowing retreat of the 2nd Infantry Division from Kunu-ri.  This account, even more than the rest of the book, is drawn from post-combat interviews since most of the official records were lost.  It tells of an approximately six mile retreat, done by some units at night in subzero temperatures, down a narrow road while under enemy fire from both sides.  It is an example of confused command, bad coordination between units, and courage and cowardice.<br />After the retreat from Kunu-ri, we get the details of Operation Bug-Out, its unofficial title in some quarters, when the UN forces fled approximately 300 miles south of their most northernly positions in Korea.<br />All this detail, while boring at times, is sometimes quite informative to those unacquainted with the details of military logistics.  I gleaned, in passing, some understanding of how advances and retreats are planned, the intricacies of the quartermaster's work, and the coordination of artillery support with the infantry.<br />As you would expect from the author of the US Army's offical history of the first five months of the Korean War, this book is also partially intended as a case study for professional military men.  Appleman criticizes the actions of everyone from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and MacArthur to the behavior of privates.  He restates the frequent criticism that MacArthur's notion of reunifying Korea was foolish.  Korea's border with China was unpatrollable by the forces MacArthur had to say nothing of his misreading of Chinese intention and capabilities.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff should have denied MacArthur permission to advance to the Chinese border.  Appleman also notes a general lack of ground reconnaisance to scout out the disposition of Chinese forces before and after their second offensive.  It was failure to maintain contact with the enemy which was partially responsible for the decision not to form a defensive line at the waist of Korea in December 1950 even though the Chinese did not, indeed could not, follow the retreating forces.<br />On the mid-levels of command, Appleman also notes problems.  In the withdrawal from Kunu-ri, Colonel Freeman's controversial decision not to perform a rearguard action for the retreating column is covered.  Appleman sees it as a breakdown in coordination and the chain of command.  Appleman also notes how General Walker had units in reserve but did not use them in a northward attack to clear the Chinese roadblock between Sunchon and Kunu-ri.  He mentions, but has no explanation for, the British Middlesex Battalion's failure to support the retreat as ordered.<br />On the lowest levels, Appleman notes a general lack of discipline, with some notable exceptions, about maintaining supplies and equipment and also armor units failing to support infantry in clearing Chinese from the sides of the Kunu-ri-Sunchon road.<br />Appleman also stresses that his account corrects two misconceptions in the history of the Korean War.  Chinese General Lin Piao, a legendary figure from the Long March, did not lead troops in the second Chinese offensive of the war, and the Chinese did not exploit a gap between the Eighth Army and the X Corps.  Rather, they punched a whole in the front and exploited it.<br />Military professionals and veterans of the events covered should find this book valueable.  Casual readers of military history will find parts slow going, but the book should ultimately reward their attention.	2001-02-03

They even have a rough idea of what they did.  But Lewis and Clark have, for most, long ago petrified into icons.  Ambrose resurrects the real people behind the legend.<br />The book is a biography of Meriwether Lewis.  But, reflected in the light of Ambrose's examination, we also come to know William Clark as a real man.  Of course, the book concentrates on their famous expedition, but it's over a hundred pages before that journey starts.  Ambrose doesn't waste the space though.  Not only does he show how Lewis' life prepared him for leading the Corps of Discovery, but we also get details of Lewis' friendship with Thomas Jefferson, Lewis' experiences in the Whiskey Rebellion and his training in scientific matters before leaving for the west.  We also get a brief, but fascinating, section on how Thomas Jefferson's slaveholding was not only a moral failing, as he knew it was, but also not justifiable on an economic level since German farmers in Virginia had profitable farms with fewer acres and no slaves.<br />Of course, the bulk of the book is taken up with Lewis and Clark's trip to the Pacific and back.  And it's a gripping tale of survival, exploration, first European contact with some Indian tribes, and, briefly, of combat.  Ambrose's style is emminently readable even if, as some have noted, he does repeat certain passages from time to time.  His biggest contribution may be to emphasize Lewis' scientific contributions.  Lewis faithfully gathered a great many samples of the plants and animals he found and made detailed descriptions in his journal.<br />Those journals are at the heart of a mystery covered in this book.  Lewis' raw notes are still extant and are extensive.  But, for great chunks of time on his trip, he made no entries.  Ambrose, following other scholars, offers an explanation for those gaps.<br />Lewis' journals are also central to the mystery of his psychological dissolution.  Though he made preparations to organize his notes and publish them in book form, he never completed the job though he had plenty of time.  He came back a hero in 1806; he died from a gunshot wound in 1809.  Ambrose blames early fame, alcoholism, and Lewis' tendancy towards depression.  And he makes a convincing case, conspiracy theories notwithstanding, that it was suickide and not murder, a conclusion bolstered by Lewis' history and the opinion of his friends.  The failure to publish his findings and pass his knowledge on to a wide audience hurt the historical reputation of the expedition.  It was only in the 20th Century that Lewis and Clark became popular figures of American history.<br />Ambrose's account will certainly keep Lewis and Clark from falling into obscurity again.ogical dissolution.

And the explorers and trappers called mountain men were instrumental in all those events.<br />Utley starts his account with George Drouillard and the legendary John Colter, both members of the Lewis and Clark expedition, and concludes his main story with Kit Carson's actions in the Mexican-American War.  However, this book is not a collection of biographies.  Utley does provide sketches for some mountain man, the events they are most famous for, and, sometimes, details of their deaths.  He does not provide any real details about their gear or trapping and fighting methods.  Utley concerns himself with a broader theme:  how the travels of mountain men filled in the maps of the west, expunged certain geographical fantasies from the public mind, and drew people west.<br />Some of the mountain men here are famous.  Besides Colter, we meet Jim Bridger, trapper, Army scout, guide, and establisher of the famous trading post named after him.  We also, briefly, meet Hugh Glass who once swore to kill Bridger after he and another trapper left Glass for dead after Glass was mauled by a grizzly.  Kit Carson's adventures with John Fremont are discussed.<br />But Utley also covers less well-known, but important, mountain men.  The greatest explorer of all, Jedediah Smith, trapped beaver mainly as a means to subsidize his extensive wanderings.  Atypically literate for a mountain man, he kept extensive journals and maps -- most of which vanished after his death.  Utley considers another trapper, Joe Walker, the most accomplished of all in the mountain man craft and, as an explorer, second only to Smith.  Others had less august reputations.  Edward Rose, a trapper who lived for many years with the Crow, was frequently sought as an interpreter but never really trusted.  Too often negotiations he was involved with broke down, and he was suspected of mischief for private ends.  Old Bill Williams was known as an eccentric mountain man.  Jessie Fremont, John's wife, even accused him of cannibalism.<br />In their quest for beaver pelts, before changing fashion, overtrapping, and substitution of nutria made trapping untenable, the mountain men not only added to geographical knowledge but served as agents, intentionally and unintentionally, for American expansion to the Pacific.  They traveled to Spanish California and helped bring it into the Union by their settlements there and their actions in the Mexican-American War.  But California was not the only Pacific territory whose national ownership was disputed.  American mountain men, and this book is concerned with American citizens or those mountaineers who served American interests, competed with the English Hudson Bay Company in the Columbia River basin.  Their knowledge inspired and guided missionaries and, later, settlers into what became the Oregon Territory.  British interests there were supplanted, and some mountain men, like Joe Meek and Doc Newell, became important political figures in Oregon's early history.<br />Besides the broad story of mountaineers as the vanguard of American expansion west, there are other things of interest here.  Taos, New Mexico and its importance to fur trading is covered.  Utley talks about the little known 1823 punitive expedition against the Arikara.  Writer Washington Irving shows up as an important source for this period of history.<br />Though it is not a main point of the book, Utley does talk some about relations between the mountain men and Indians.  The attitudes ranged from racism to toleration to admiration.  Some tribes, like the Blackfeet, were constant foes of the mountain men.  Others, like the Shoshone and the Nez Perce (at least during the time of this history), were almost always friendly.<br />Utley uses his last chapter to wrap up the loose ends of some of his subjects' lives and the ultimate nature of their contributions to American development.  Cartographer Peter Dana has the final say with an interesting chapter on how the book's extensive topographical maps, detailing the travels of various mountain men and the fur trade in general, were prepared from satellite photos.<br />Utley organizes the book along geographical lines and accounts of how particular routes of travel were developed.  This leads to some confusion since he jumps back and forth in time.  However, Utley's clear style and a well-done index help keep things straight.  The footnotes are not only extensive but full of useful information.	2001-01-12

I expected a collection of military fiction mixed with science fiction or, possibly, future war stories.  But not all these stories feature combat nor do they all have soldiers, and their settings range from the past to the present.<br />Set furthest in the past is Stephen Coonts' &quot;The 17th Day&quot;.  That's the day statistics say our WWI aviator hero will not survive.  &quot;Drag Race&quot; by James H. Cobb is set in the fifties, and the author claims its combination of airborne training accident and a hot rod is based on a real incident.  James Ferro, author of the HOGS series about A-10As in the Gulf War, gives us a surprisingly moody, psychological piece, &quot;In the Hunter's Shadow&quot;.  It's about a Warthog pilot looking for his first kill.<br />Several tales are set in near futures.  &quot;UNODIR&quot; by H. Jay Riker is a strong tale.  In it, a sub commander disobeys orders to abandon a SEAL team reconnoitering Chinese forces around oil platforms in the South China Sea.  The grim &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; by John Helfers has an American mercenary returning to Vietnam after serving there in the second Vietnam War.  He's a soldier in a covert war against drugs and gets involved in local intrigues after his comrades are killed.  James H. Cobb has a second story, &quot;Point of Decision&quot; (part of his Amanda Garrett series).  On a mission to evacuate a beseiged American embassy in Africa, Lieutenant Stone Quillain has to decide whether to also rescue a hated figure of the recently deposed government or let him and his family be killed.  The problem is Washington hasn't given him any orders either way.<br />&quot;The Man Who Got Khruschev&quot; by Jim DeFelice is set in the 60s and 90s but has a science fictional feel to it, particularly reminiscent of Philip K. Dick's fiction.  A retiring collegeprofessor begins to recover his identity as a CIA operative sent to kill Khruschev in retaliation for JFK's murder.<br />S.M. Stirling turns in a surprisingly bad story, &quot;Flyboy&quot;.  It's about industrial espionage aimed at stealing a technology that allows fighter planes to be controlled via thoughts relayed by an implanted chip.  Enjoyable but not really fitting in with the collection's military theme or settings is William C. Deitz's &quot;The Bodyguard and the Client Who Wouldn't Die&quot;.  It's hero, Max Maxon from Deitz's BODYGUARD, is charged with the strange task of making sure his client stays dead.<br />The Turtledove story originally seems to be the simple, harrowing tale of a German soldier fleeing Russian troops on the Eastern Front of WWII.  However, it slowly turns into something else, and Turtledove manages the transition without seeming gimmicky.  Whether it's a trip sideways in time or a trip into our future I'm not sure.<br />With the exception of the Stirling story, all the stories are enjoyable and worth reading.  A fair number are memorable.	2001-01-10

I wanted a lurid tale of Nazis in the Antarctica, up to no good with a super weapon or maybe establishing the beginnings of that secret base that, according to an old Police Gazette issue, Hitler fled to after the war.  When I found out that Dietrich grafted a fictional plot on to the actual 1938 Nazi expedition to the frozen continent, I was fine with that too.  I always wondered what they were up to down there.<br />Bush pilot Owen Hart takes up a Nazi offer to return to Antarctica, site of a former expedition whose failure some blame him for.  Ambitious Nazi Jurgen Drexler has talked the Nazi hierarchy into leading an expedition south to stake Third Reich claims in the Antarctic and research the feasibility of whaling there, whale oil being a strategic war material.  In December 1938, the expedition departs.  Besides the usual support types of sailors and pilots, the expedition includes Drexler, Hart, a sinister Nazi doctor, some SS alpine troops for muscle, and one Greta Heinz, &quot;polar biologist&quot;.  Heinz's possesses questionable qualifications.  She's Drexler's girlfriend, not a noted scientist.  <br />The book starts slow.  Things don't start to take off until over a hundred pages into the book with a violent encounter between the Nazis, bent on asserting their territorial claims in southern waters, and a Norwegian whaling vessel.  Crippled in the encounter, the ship limps into the bay of an island where the grisly effects of a new plague organism are on display.<br />The rest of the novel is taken up with Drexler scheming to use the plague as a weapon and Hart scheming to become Heinz's lover.  <br />I did like a couple of things in this book.  The structure, where Hart's visits to Atropos Island are separated by most of WWII, was pleasantly unexpected.  I also liked the portrayal of Drexler who was not the usual cliched Nazi constantly talking of the Master Race and wiping out Jews.  Mostly an amoral careerist whose advancement is tied to the Third Reich's, he looks upon Greta as a trophy.  His struggles against Hart are as much for Heinz's loyalty as ideological.<br />That said, I could have done without the whole romance between Hart and Heinz though it motivates much of the plot.  Characters thrown together and falling in love is such an annoying cliche in suspense thrillers that it's basically part of the formula.<br />I didn't find this novel very suspenseful.  Oddly enough, given Dietrich's background as a science journalist and visitor to Antarctica, I also didn't find this novel particularly interesting, scientifically, or evocative of the place.  There wasn't enough detail, for me, about the microecosystem of Atropos Island.  I also found Heinz's lab aboard ship, with her attendant feats of isolation, testing, and culturing Atropos' plague, somewhat unbelievable.	2001-01-08

The peace treaty imposed on the Confederacy is obviously modelled on the Treaty of Versailles -- and has an even greater potential for cheating.  Politically, of course, a victorious Germany on the Continent has profound implications for the future.  As in our history, armored breakthroughs end the stalemate of trench warfare.  Here the idea comes from an unlikely source:  George Armstrong Custer, whose single notable quality, for good or ill, is aggressiveness.  A noted variation from our timeline is an earlier linkage of air power with naval power.<br />But the real attraction of the book is to find out what happens to the characters we've followed in earlier books.  Some benefit in unexpected ways from war.  Some suffer.  And some don't survive the war.  Some carry on the fight after the armistice, and others begin to prepare for what they believe will be another war between the United States and the Confederacy.<br />The most interesting development is that one embittered Confederate veteran seems on his way to becoming a Hitlerian figure in the series' future.	2001-01-07

Heinlein's [[ASIN:0671318454 Orphans of the Sky]], a novel he felt lacking in emotion, Aldiss' novel is a classic generation starship tale.<br /><br />The idea that their universe is the inside of a giant spaceship is known but derided in the Greene tribe.  They're a barbarous lot.  They destroy books whenever they find them.  The Teaching, a Freudian inspired religion with its talk of id and ego, values full and immediate expression of fear and anger lest the repression of those emotions curdle into neurosis.  A nomadic lot, they seal off the hallway they live in, moving the barricades when they exhaust the \\"ponics\\", plants that abound in the ship's corridors.  Their power stems from a cache of weapons found two generations ago.<br /><br />And protagonist Roy Complain is not happy with his life in the tribe.  He gets flogged for losing his woman on a hunting expedition into the \\"deadways\\" beyond the tribes \\"Quarters\\".  Chaffing under the Teaching and floggings of his tribe, Complain decides to accompany priest Marapper and three others through the deadways and to the land of the advanced people of Forwards.  Marapper expects, somewhere, to find the ship's control room, seize control of the vessel, and end this painful journey through the stars.<br /><br />In his wanderings, Complain learns the truth behind the other groups -- the mutants, the Outsiders, and the Giants -- rumored to inhabit the ship.  Aldiss puts an ironic twist to the generation starship tale, particularly [[ASIN:B000OIS0PA Orphans of the Sky]], when he reveals the exact situation of the ship.  By novel's end, Aldiss gives a detailed and ingenious explanation for Complain's world.<br /><br />It's not necessary to read the Heinlein story, or any other generation starship tale, to appreciate this fine novel.  Aldiss gives us believable emotion and, in Complain, a fine portrait of a man growing into a true knowledge of himself and his world.	2001-01-06

After the mutiny, people forgot not only their mission to travel to Far Centaurus but that there was a universe outside the ship's hull.  Books are still around, but physics and astronomy are treated like elaborate allegories by the &quot;scientists&quot; and not realities.  Barbaric muties roam the upper decks, and cannibalism is not unknown, infantcide a common practice.  <br />Scientist novitiate Hugh Hoyland plays the Galileo role.  He is captured by two-headed mutant Joe-Jim and, when he's not playing checkers with either of the twins, has the run of their library and the benefit of their intellects.  It's from that unlikely source that Hoyland learns the truth about the ship and the world outside.  <br />And he begins to form a plan to complete the mission.<br />First published in 1941 as two short stories, &quot;Universe&quot; and &quot;Common Sense&quot;, this story still entertains with its heroism, intrigue, and action.  They are, chronologically, also the last short stories in Heinlein's Future History.	2000-12-20
US	52939892	R6ZS8D5UAX5E0	0671578022	246124411	The Menace From Earth	Books	4	23	28	N	N	A Mixed Bag From Heinlein	There are no truly bad stories in this collection though the title story features annoying teenagers in an annoying romantic plot.  The teenagers annoy with their brilliance, and the plot annoys with its story of the girl narrator discovering, after the introduction of a beautiful Earth woman, that her boy friend is really her boyfriend.  Still, you get a travelogue of Luna City, possibly the first example in science fiction of the sport of human-powered flight in low gravity, and another of Heinlein's Future History tales.<br /><br />Not at all annoying, in fact a downright classic, \\"By His Bootstraps\\" is the grandfather of all those time travel stories where the protagonist crosses his own lifepath at different points to make a plot so confusing you need a diagram to sum it up.  This one also features alien ruins and a changed humanity 30,000 years in the future.<br /><br />\\"The Year of the Jackpot\\" is a tale about the cyclical nature of all sorts of natural and social phenomena from earthquakes to public nudity to ufo sightings to religious fervor and a whole lot more.  Its mathematician hero notes that all the cycles will bottom out at the same time, and he decides to take his girlfriend and head for the hills to await the collapse of civilization.  It's a fun story and distinguished by a shortage of the can-do spirit of much of Heinlein's work.<br /><br />On the minor side are three stories.  \\"Columbus Was a Dope\\" is a short, ironic tale about the sorts who are driven to explore and those that mock that drive.  \\"Sky Lift\\" is about a space mission at very high gs to take emergency vaccine to an outpost on Pluto.  \\"Project Nightmare\\" follows the efforts of a team of American psychics to stop a Soviet blackmail attempt that has concealed nukes in US cities.<br /><br />The Gulf of California flooding the Imperial Valley after an earthquake is the engaging premise of \\"Water Is for Washing\\".<br /><br />Stylistically, \\"Goldfish Bowl\\", one of the strongest and oddest stories in the collection, is typical Heinlein, but the plot and ideas reminded me of H.P. Lovecraft.  Investigating the appearance of two permanent waterspouts, two scientists are captured by mysterious entities whose relation to us is not at all comforting.	2000-12-18
US	52939892	RCM6UUO29A2A3	0671578537	817159383	The Green Hills of Earth	Books	4	27	27	N	N	Workaday Tales of Life in Space	This collection is fifty years old and, yes, the tales, with their atomic rockets and homegrown aliens in our own solar system, have dated.  But most of the stories are still worth reading with one genuine classic and a couple of near-classics.<br />The stories are built around two general themes:  workaday life in a future where space travel is common and genuine heroism.<br />On the workaday side is &quot;Delilah and the Space Rigger&quot;, a tale about how the only woman on a space construction project affects her hundreds of male co-workers.  &quot;Space Jockey&quot; moves a common situation, the strains work can place on a marriage, into the future when a rocket pilot must decide whether to quit his job or possibly leave his wife.  In &quot;Gentlemen, Be Seated&quot;, a moonquake puts some lives at risks in the tunnels under Luna City.  It's work of an unusual sort in &quot;'-We Also Walk Dogs'&quot;.  It shows the inner workings of General Services, a company whose boast, that no job is too large or too small, is put to the test when the laws of physics have to be modified for an alien trade conference.<br />A couple of other stories are not built around work per se but still feature domestic matters.  &quot;The Black Pits of Luna&quot; concerns a tourist from Earth, a small boy, getting lost on the moon's surface.  Its juvenile narrator foreshadows the young adult science fiction novels Heinlein later wrote.  The ironically titled &quot;It's Great to Be Back&quot; features a family returning to Earth after three years stay on the moon.  The old planet doesn't live up to their cherished memories.<br />It's work of a grim sort in the near-classic &quot;Logic of Empire&quot; about slavery and colonial exploitation on Venus.  It doesn't end happily and, by this point in Heinlein's Future History, Prophet Nehemiah Scudder looms on the horizon.<br />Tales of heroism figure in the rest of the collection's stories.  The hero of &quot;Ordeal in Space&quot; has to retire after picking up a debilitating case of acrophobia when he saves a luxury space liner from destruction.  He finds a cure in an unlikely place.  &quot;The Long Watch&quot; is another almost classic.  In it, one man foils a military coup that threatens Earth.<br />The undisputed classic here is &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot;, a biography of the blind poet Rhysling.  Part Homer, part Robert Burns, and part Rudyard Kipling, he travels through space and to Venus and Mars and recites some pretty good poetry before meeting a tragic end.	2000-12-17

That relatively advanced age for a beginning science fiction writer may account for the power of his work, its feeling of authenticity.  Unlike most of his contemporaries, Heinlein wasn't just interested in science and technology.  He also had a knowledge and appreciation of how the worlds of business, law, and politics worked and how they intersected with the world of the lab.<br />The stories in this collection represent the beginnings of Heinlein's Future History series.  Events since their publication in the 30s and 40s have dated them, but most still entertain.  <br />&quot;Life-Line&quot; and '&quot;Let There Be Light&quot;' have dated the least, and both concern supression of new technologies.  The former concerns a scientist who earns the murderous ire of insurance companies because he can predict the date of a person's death.  The latter concerns development of a very efficient capture method for solar energy.<br />The extrapolation around the dated, but still enjoyable, &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot; probably seemed quite reasonable at the time of its writing.  America's increasing use of cars, resultant urban sprawl and expense, coupled with increased fuel cost and &quot;super-highways&quot;, would lead to giant, high-speed conveyor belts carrying people and products between cities.  Some of the engineers who tend the road decide to bring it to a stop unless their demands are met.  Their political philosophy of &quot;functionalism&quot; sounds modern and plausible though it's really an old idea found in the Bible and Roman history.<br />&quot;Blowups Happen&quot; is one of those atomic power stories from the forties.  Like &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot;, Heinlein is as interested in the men maintaining the machines as the machines themselves.  Here the technicians who tend a giant nuclear pile in Arizona frequently crack under the stress of knowing what disaster a mistake could bring.<br />Heinlein the social animal is on full display in &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;.  Less concerned with scientific and technical details than with political, legal, and business intrigues, it tells the story of how one Delos Harriman gets man to the moon.  He's the first in a new line of robber barons and, perhaps, the  founder of a new imperialism that will show up later in the Future History series.  Harriman's real goal, though, is denied him.  He isn't interested in putting just anyone on the moon.  He wants to go there.<br />Heinlein's famous &quot;Requiem&quot; is both prequel and sequel to &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;.  In it, we get the details of Harriman's lunar obsession and the realization of his dream.  Unusual for Heinlein, it's a very emotional story full of poignancy Anyone interested in classic science fiction, the beginnings of Heinlein's influential career, or just how the future looked in the forties should enjoy this collection.	2000-12-16
US	52939892	RVV4T4PTQJ4UU	0671577808	504852204	Revolt in 2100 & Methuselah's Children	Books	4	56	58	N	N	Some of the Stories that Made Heinlein's Reputation	There are two ways to appreciate this collection of two short stories, a novella, and a novel.<br />First is on its own merit.  The novella &quot;Revolt in 2100&quot; stands at the beginning of a long tradition of undergrounds battling  future tyrannys.  Here Heinlein gives us a Masonic cabal subverting a future American theocracy.  Its protagonist gradually finds himself, for the love of a woman, transformed from guard of the Prophet to a revolutionary and questioning his own most basic beliefs.  &quot;Coventry&quot; is one of those stories about what happens when convicts are allowed to build their own societies without supervision.  Its literary critic protagonist doesn't find the liberating anarchy he expects amongst society's outcasts.  In the novel METHUSELAH'S CHILDREN, a group of long-lived humans flee a resentful Earth and head out to the stars.  It's neatly divided between a first half featuring a chase thriller and the more philosophical second half with its multiple alien contacts and what they say about man's purpose in the universe.<br />One story, &quot;Misfit&quot;, is not that interesting in itself, but, like the entire collection, reveals a lot about Heinlein's appeal.  It's detail-filled tale of a mathematical genius working on a futuristic Cosmic Construction Corps project to turn an asteroid into a space station probably inspired many a future aerospace engineer.  Those familiar with the science fiction of the late thirties and forties, when Heinlein got his start, will be reminded, by these tales, why he was so appealing.  His tales are filled with minutae of political thought, engineering, military tactics, biology, and human psychology.  Almost as much a Renaissance man as his famous Lazarus Long, first introduced in METHUSELAH'S CHILDREN, Heinlein speculated on the future of many things.<br />However, as this collection shows, he was also a man of his time.  Think FDR's CCC for the Cosmic Construction Corps or note the references to Freud and Alfred Korzybski's General Semantics, remnants of the days when science fiction writers were convinced social sciences would soon produce the predictability of the physical sciences.<br />Heinlein fans unfamiliar with this edition will appreciate notes by Heinlein on the Future History stories he didn't write and why.<br />Those who have categorized Heinlein as a fascist or anarchist may want to rethink their opinions after reading this collection, especially &quot;Coventry&quot;.d Alfred Korzybski's General Semantics, remnants of the days when science fiction writers were convinced social sciences would soon produce the predictability of the physical sciences.<br />Heinlein fans unfamiliar with this edition will appreciate notes by Heinlein on the Future History stories he didn't write and why.<br />Those who have categorized Heinlein as a fascist or anarchist may want to rethink their opinions after reading this collection, especially &quot;Coventry&quot;.	2000-12-15
US	52939892	RNAN3NYBSGM03	1892884046	529520577	Dakota Dreamin'	Books	3	1	1	N	Y	He's No Simak, But He's Worth Reading	I'll admit I bought this collection because I expected Johnson to be sort of a Clifford Simak for South Dakota, but the state only shows up as a setting in Johnson's most famous story, the Hugo-winning &quot;We Will Drink a Fish Together.&quot;  Now, I'm from South Dakota too, but I'm not familiar with fish drinking or the idea of &quot;lines&quot;, sort of clans of not necessarily related people.  But, then, I'm from the Black Hills, the other end of the state from the town of Summit where the story takes place.  And, as Johnson notes in the collection's introduction, that's a different geography and a different culture.  The story is like Simak in its mixture of aliens and rural America and quirky characters though its plot, involving an alien ambassador fleeing assassins and the narrator attending the funeral of the head of his line, is a bit hard edged for Simak.  Johnson's perceptions match mine when he talks about Dakota weather and the easy acceptance of strangers there.  <br />Aliens show up frequently in these stories as they do in Simak's work.  The &quot;Motivational Engineers&quot; have a surprising reason for visiting Earth on a trade mission.  The old idea of aliens judging man's suitability for continued existence is reworked in &quot;Respect.&quot;  Its tale of aliens getting involved in a future border war between Mexico and the U.S. seems to owe something to George Orwell's famous essay, &quot;Shooting an Elephant.&quot; I suppose &quot;Every Choice Has a Price&quot; was intended as a thoughtful, controversial discussion of abortion ethics.  A woman has to decide between carrying a child to term and losing her telepathic abilities or aborting it and possibly wresting the secret of travel between the stars from an injured alien. The story's ending seemed contrived, though, and Johnson's ultimate point unclear.  Another story with a weak ending was &quot;Streetwise,&quot; a satire on lawyers and bureaucrats in which an ambulance chaser brings up theidea of implicit agreements to a bunch of mysterious aliens.  They've established several uncommunicative enclaves in various cities -- after clearly demonstrating their invincibility and invulnerability.  The motivation for the aliens putting up with the lawyer wasn't entirely clear, but the story was still fun.<br />The weakest story in the collection, &quot;A Matter of Thirst,&quot; doesn't involve aliens at all.  It's Johnson's entry in the &quot;end of the world sweepstakes&quot;.  The setup of Earth's civilization collapsing from a cancer plague and leaving orbital colonies to fend for themselves was good.  And Johnson does a nice job showing how heroic efforts at scavenging and recycling vital materials is not going to be enough to save the race.  But his solution to the problem is unbelievable.<br />In the middle ground of quality is Johnson's first sale, &quot;Stormfall.&quot;  It's a moody piece about a man who glides into hurricanes to tame their fury.  &quot;Send Random Romantic&quot; is a cross between a ghost story and one of those tales where denizens of an overregulated, compulsively tranquil future rediscover some of the joys and pains of their antique ancestors.  &quot;Meet Me at Apogee&quot; is an exciting treasure hunt tale set in orbit around a black hole.  A man is hired to help retrieve some religious artifacts off an abandoned spaceship but soon finds himself involved in lethal religious fanaticism and schism.<br />My favorite stories were &quot;Evelyn's Children,&quot; about a Presidential campaign manager investigating some pecularities in the census of Chicago, and &quot;One Quiet Night,&quot; an all too plausible tale about what some harried, very tired parents would do with a &quot;standstill box&quot;. <br />Even though I had problems with some of Johnson's endings, he's still a writer not content to limit himself to one type or style of story, and he knows how to evoke a place.	2000-11-02
US	52939892	R18X13LYSRCUOC	0345408578	248388677	Bloom	Books	4	15	15	N	N	Detailed Nanotechnology and Strong Characterization	Sometime in the mid-twenty-first century, a nanotechnology accident of unknown origin devours Earth and then the moon.  The end result, the Mycosystem, is a growing rot feeding on any organic and inorganic material it encounters.  Like its fungal namesake, it spreads by spores.<br />Riding on the solar wind, these spores cause &quot;blooms&quot; when they enter the human habitats inside Ganymede, Callisto and assorted asteroids.  For twenty years, man has survived by developing elaborate &quot;immune systems&quot; to fight the blooms.  However, recent blooms show an alarming sophistication and ability to skirt these countermeasures.  Armored against &quot;technogenic life&quot;, the spaceship Louis Pasteur departs for the depths of the Mycosystem, Earth and Mars.  Its mission is to determine whether the Mycosystem has developed the ability to inhabit new niches in the Solar System.<br />Documenting the mission is John Strasheim, a former cobbler given the chance to practice his talents as an amateur journalist.  But, shortly after the mission is underway, evidence comes forth that humans still exist in the Mycosystem -- and that someone wants the mission to fail.<br />This book has a lot to like.  McCarthy tells a taut, hard science story.  His nanotechnology is not magic.  Indeed, he shows various ways -- ph balances, chemicals, too much and too little energy -- the &quot;gray goo&quot; type of nanotechnology accident could be contained.  He also delves into ideas of complex systems, their emergent properties, and the implications of using evolutionary design to combat the Mycosystem and understand it.<br />McCarthy also does a very good job with the characterization of narrator Strasheim as he learns new truths about the Mycosystem and confronts the possibility of a violent death.  The captain of the Louis Pasteur is also a memorable character, a man so lacking in a sense of humor that he literally has one surgically implanted.  My only complaint with the novel isthat McCarthy doesn't bring to life the other crew members of the Pasteur except for Renata Baucum, a Mycosystem specialist antagonistic to Strasheim.<br />McCarthy keeps his scientific and political mystery brief and fast moving.  While the revelations of the Mycosystem's nature are not totally unexpected, McCarthy brings in enough interesting detail and ambiguity to make it interesting.	2000-10-02
US	52939892	R17EES7IHYS2V5	0451129768	402015635	Science Fictional Olympics (Isaac Asimov's Wonderful Worlds of Science Fiction #2)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	More Than Just Olympic Contests	Olympic contests between the Soviet bloc and America were often exploited for propaganda purposes, the outcome of an athletic event supposedly saying something significant about the victor's country.  This 1984 anthology, from the height of the Cold War, has several stories built around that notion.<br />Tom Sullivan's &quot;The Mickey Mouse Olympics&quot; and Nicholas V. Yermakov's &quot;A Glint of Gold&quot; both feature Soviet and American Olympic athletes genetically modified for their events.  Sullivan plays the notion for genuine laughs.  Yermakov's story is much more serious and shows the price the competitors pay as propaganda pawns.  He also works in a defection subplot.<br />Walter F. Moudy's &quot;The Survivor&quot; abandons all together the notion of mere symbolic combat in the Olympics.  In his future, the USSR and USA each put 100 man combat teams into the arena, and they don't come out till one side is annihilated.  It's all televised, of course.  Moudy is not content to just do a story of future gladiatorial matches.  He also delves into what the combat conditioning does to the soldier, what kind of person it produces.  It isn't idle speculation, either,  because all the survivors of an Olympic War Game get to do whatever they want with no legal sanctions.  It's one of the highpoints of the anthology.<br />Not all of the stories deal with future Olympics; the general theme is competition.<br />In the case of the dentist in Piers Anthony &quot;Getting Through University&quot;, basis for his novel PROSTHO PLUS, the competition is to get accepted to galactic University, School of Dentistry.  Anthony creates an entertaining story out of the complexities of dentistry on the galaxy's aliens.<br />Other highpoints are Norman Spinrad's &quot;The National Pastime&quot;, &quot;The Wind from the Sun&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke, and &quot;Prose Bowl&quot; from the team of Bill Pronzini and Barry N. Malzberg.  Spinrad's story tells of the invention of Combat Football and its fans very violent enthusiasm for it.  It's a 1973 story but hasn't dated that much, especially since wrestling promoters now talk of starting their own football league.  Clarke's story combines hard science and melancholy in a solar sail race.  Also titled &quot;Sunjammer&quot;, it was probably the first story to use the idea of solar sails.  &quot;Prose Bowl&quot; makes hack writing into an hilarious spectator sport, but it also says some serious things about writers and their audiences.<br />On the decidely low end of the anthology are Jack Vance's &quot;The Kokod Warriors&quot;, about aliens who fight elaborate combats and the humans who bet on them, and Charles Nuetzel's &quot;A Day for Dying&quot;, one of those stories with a decadent society of televised bloodsports and an unconvincing revolution to topple it.  George Alec Effinger's &quot;From Downtown at the Buzzer&quot;, about some aliens fascination with basketball, is marred by a vague ending.<br />In the entertaining-but-nothing-special category are the rest of the anthology's works.  George R.R. Martin's &quot;Run to Starlight&quot; has aliens playing football against humans.  The aliens turn out to have a more realistic view of the games' ultimate significance than the humans.  Bob Shaw's &quot;Dream Fighter&quot; is another one of those stories where combatants assault each other mentally with horrifying symbols.  Suzette Haden Elgin's &quot;For the Sake of Grace&quot; is a feminist story about a poetry contest on a world with an Arab-type culture and the young girl who dares to enter it despite the horrifying consequences of failing.  Robert Sheckley's &quot;The People Trap&quot; is a witty, grim tale of a race for land in an overpopulated world.  &quot;Why Johnny Can't Speed&quot; by Alan Dean Foster is another combat on the highways story.  It was possibly a response to Harlan Ellison's classic &quot;Along the Scenic Route&quot;.  &quot;Nothing in the Rules&quot; by L. Sprague de Camp isabout the chaos caused by a mermaid entering a swimming match.  &quot;The Olympians&quot; by Mike Resnick is not, despite the title, a future Olympics tale.  The Olympians are an elite group of humans who specialize in humiliating aliens in athletic competitions.<br />There are enough good stories here to justify taking a look at this anthology.	2000-09-24

William Mandella,  wife Marygay, and many of the other old veterans are getting tired of their  relatively primitive life on that planet.  And they find Man  disconcertingly alien and fear that the clones will someday decide to rid  themselves of their inferiors.  They hatch a plan to fly a starship fast  enough to take advantage of relativistic effects and return to Middle  Finger 40,000 years in its future.  A future where they hope Man will be  absent or have evolved to the point of leaving them alone.    Tauran  representatives and Man put obstacles in their way, but old human cunning  wins out, and they embark for the future.  But things are just getting  under way when very odd things began to happen.  Antimatter begins  inexplicably disappearing from their ship.  And even odder things have  happened to the people back on Middle Finger and Earth . . .    Haldeman  can't be faulted for not wanting to make this sequel to [[ASIN:0307279448 The Forever War (Vintage)]] a  war story.  Instead, he gives us a mystery story.  Unfortunately, the novel  is unbalanced by the payoff he gives us at the end.  It's too glib, too  metaphysical to justify the length of the story before it nor is the idea  that new.  On the other hand, Haldeman could have explored the consequences  of his solution more fully which would have lead to a better and longer  novel.    The novel opens with a poem about men assuming the powers of gods  to bring about peace.  Haldeman doesn't really develop that theme much or  make any coherent thematic statements about war and violence and freedom as  I hoped he would.	2000-09-20
US	52939892	R377E6WLB7YQX	0451452585	213423025	Dealing in Futures	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Worth Reading Even Though Some Stories Are Minor	Haldeman's second short story collection has not only science fiction but  also horror, poetry, and Haldeman's only sword-and-sorcery tale.<br />It  starts off strong with two stories set in Haldeman's Confederacion  universe, most notably used in his novel ALL MY SINS REMEMBERED.  A team of  anthropologists are unpleasantly surprised when their seemingly peaceful  alien subjects become murderous.  Haldeman constructs a grim, suspenseful  story from the first person narratives of people fleeing for their lives  across an alien world.  Much less serious is &quot;A !Tangled Web&quot;  about linguistic and cultural confusions during a trade negotiation with  aliens.  These aliens have an elaborate and hilarious repertoire of  self-deprecating phrases.<br />Haldeman's prose often has wit and irony in  even his most serious novels but that aspect of his work really livens up  &quot;Seven and the Stars&quot; despite its worn plot of a science fiction  writer meeting a real alien.<br />Horror of the traditional and supernatural  sort is featured in &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, an interesting tale  mostly set in Mexico during the Mexican-American War, and &quot;Lindsay and  the Red City Cross&quot;.  The latter is set in the unpleasant, sinister  bazaar of Djemaa El Fna in Marrakesh.  The story was inspired by an  unpleasant trip Haldeman took to Morocco though his luck there was  obviously better than his protagonist.<br />Though inspired by Poe and, in a  roundabout way Daniel Keyes' classic &quot;Flowers for Algernon, &quot;More  Than the Sum of His Parts&quot; is high-tech, rather than traditional,  horror.  The narrator's body is mostly replaced with cybernetic substitutes  which help him realize his egomaniac and increasingly lethal fantasies.   Haldeman's alternate title, &quot;Tom Swift and His Electric Penis&quot;  should give you some idea where this story goes.  It's one of the high  points of the collection.<br />Pastiches of other genres show up twice.   &quot;Blood Sisters&quot; is a Mickey Spillane type story with the Mafia  and clones and, of course, lots of sex and gunplay.  &quot;Blood  Brothers&quot; is Haldeman's sole entry into the sword-and-sorcery field.   Written for Robert Asprin's Thieve's World universe, it's a minor story  about a villainous tavern owner.<br />For Haldeman fans, the most interesting  story will probably be &quot;You Can Never Go Back&quot;.  It's Haldeman's  first draft of the story that eventually became the Sergeant Mandella  section of his most celebrated work, THE FOREVER WAR.  It's not only longer  than the novel version but features a violent, more depressing America and  different family details for Mandella and Potter.  Haldeman likes this  version better though he admits that it would have slowed the novel down  too much.<br />Unfortunately, the last two stories in the collection are  minor.  &quot;No Future in It&quot; is a gimmicky alternate history/time  travel story which leaves out the meat of an alternate history story:  why  things changed.  &quot;The Pilot&quot; is about a cyborg starship that gets  really annoyed with tv interviewers.<br />As with his most recent short story  collection, NONE SO BLIND, Haldeman finishes the book off with some of his  accomplished verse, here three science fiction story poems.  Each entry in  the collection features an introduction and afterword by Haldeman  explaining the origins and inspirations of the stories.	2000-09-18

A world in the past, a world where Adolf Hitler  and the Nazi party are more than just obscure players in German political  history.<br />They succeed, and the novel opens in 1974 with an America grimly  preparing to fight the final battle against the Nazi menace which spans the  globe.  The Proteus team -- commandos, physicists, and politicians from  that doomed world -- travels back to 1939.  There they will attempt to  reshape history with political manipulation and atomic weapons.<br />Hogan not  only does a nice job of building an alternate timeline which diverges from  ours in 1930's Germany, but he also details the history of Nazi aggression  in our world and constructs, through the Proteus team's efforts, a secret  history of our timeline.  Or is it?  Hogan, establishing the mutability of  history, keeps the reader guessing as to the outcome of what seems to be  our past.  <br />Along the way, he not only gives us the expected historical  figures of Churchill and Roosevelt, but also physicists Albert Einstein,  Enrico Fermi, and Edward Teller.  And there's an odd young writer named  Isaac Asimov hanging about too.<br />I have one minor complaint with this  novel.  Hogan belabors the explanation of the quantam mechanics  he uses to  move the plot.  However, his detailed explanation was probably necessary  for those for whom this is their first exposure to the idea, presumably a  fair number of the technothriller and alternate history crowd who should  like this book as well as Hogan's usual science fiction reader.	2000-09-13
US	52939892	R33JV9V5ODF1D6	0691001960	896395734	The Nazi War on Cancer	Books	4	27	34	N	N	A Whole New Way to Think About Nazis	There's a lot of interesting material in this book:  Nazi ideas of the  proper diet, indications that the Nazi Institute for Cancer Research may  have been a cover for developing bioweapons, and, of course, the chapter  that has garnered the most attention:  \\"The Campaign Against  Tobacco\\".  Throughout the book Proctor uses the Nazi concern with  cancer to show that Nazi science, while often motivated by bizarre or evil  notions, wasn't always shoddy.  He also shows that it's a mistake to think  of Nazi Germany as a totalitarian monolith that always reflected Hitler's  will.<br /><br />For instance, while Hitler wanted to eventually ban smoking, he was  ultimately defeated by cultural resistance to the notion and the desire to  keep tobacco taxes coming in and tobacco exports leaving.  Still, it was  Nazi science that first indicated that smoking was harmful though its  general emphasis on clinical studies with few patients caused it to be  ignored by epidemiologists in other countries.  However, the Anglo-American  scientists who made their reputations by proving that smoking was a major  cause of lung cancer were preceded more than 10 years by Franz H. Muller's  dissertation on that link, the first \\"case-control epidemiologic\\"  study to do so.  And he did it in 1939 Germany.<br /><br />Besides its material on  Nazi scientific efforts to diagnose, cure, and prevent cancer, the book  also has some very interesting illustrations of Nazi public health  propaganda.  My favorite illustration, though, is of various animals giving  the \\"Heil\\" salute to Goering who banned vivisection in 1933.<br />My  one quibble with the book is Proctor's insistence that his book provides no  aid and comfort to those, like libertarian Jacob Sullum -- whose book [[ASIN:0684827360 For Your Own Good: The Anti-Smoking Crusade and the Tyranny of Public Health]]  is specifically mentioned in the final chapter -- who wish to link  anti-smoking efforts with Nazis.  I've never heard any anti-smoking  activist propose euthanasia programs or putting people in concentration  camps.  However, the Nazi regime justified its coercive public health  measures with the philosophy that your body was state property and  \\"nutrition was not a private matter\\".  And, as in modern America,  economic rationales were given for the Nazi laws intended to make life  difficult for smokers.  Proctor also speculates, in the Prologue, that  public health measures like the Nazi war on tobacco could have been one of  the appealing tunes in the siren suite of Hitler's fascism.  Not everyone  became a Nazi to kill Jews.  And not all the doctors who signed up with the  Nazi Party were quacks.  This book does provide some evidence that coercive  public health measures that go beyond mere education can spring from a  totalitarian impulse.	2000-09-06

Asimov's famous human and robot  detective team of Lije Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw are here for their only  short story appearance, &quot;Mirror Image.&quot;  The murderous mobile law  enforcer of Ron Goulart's &quot;Into the Shop&quot; captures the same  criminal -- again and again.  A robotic Sherlock Holmes, his  Cockney-rhyming robot dog, and a Watson of mysterious origins investigate  the case of a possibly mad industrialist on a future greenhouse Earth in  Edward Wellen's &quot;Voiceover&quot;. <br />Wellen also gives us an  interesting, proto-cyberpunk story, &quot;Finger of Fate&quot;, with its  hard-boiled, if immobile, computer who prowls databases and public records  to solve his cases.  The machines of Harry Harrison's &quot;Arm of the  Law&quot; and Harlan Ellison's and Ben Bova's &quot;Brillo&quot; are not  exactly detectives but robot cops, and each must deal with police  corruption and the difference between theoretical law enforcement and  carrying a badge in the real world of humans.  &quot;Brillo&quot; also  deals with bluecollar fears of being replaced by machines.  The tin stars  of Larry Niven's famous &quot;Cloak of Anarchy&quot; supervise a Free Park  where anything except physical violence goes -- until an artist decides to  put his political ideas into effect and disable them.  Stephen R.  Donaldson's &quot;Animal Lover&quot; is a cyborg federal cop sent to  investigate a hunting preserve with an oddly high body count of  hunters.<br />Stories that don't feature robotic investigators and law  enforcers are Christopher Anvil's tedious &quot;The King's Legions&quot;, a  tale of political machinations and a nearly-magical, sentient spaceship.   Technological innovations since its original publication date of 1963 make  Larry Eisenberg's &quot;The Fastest Draw&quot; a fully realistic story.  In  it, a man obsessively tries to make his fast draw competitions with a  gunfighter simulcra more realistic.  Harry Harrison's &quot;The Powers of  Observation&quot; is a predictable but involving tale of espionage and  androids in a Cold War Yugoslavia.  &quot;Faithfully Yours&quot; by Lou  Tabakow, about a convict fleeing some implacable retribution, is flawed by  an irrelevant beginning and an ending that stops at the point where things  get interesting.  The strength of Donald Wismer's &quot;Safe Harbor&quot;  is undercut by the rather unbelievable motivation of a central character  who opts out of a world largely automated and administered with the help of  &quot;bugs&quot;, skull implants that monitor health and track their users  in case they need emergency aid.  Henry Slesar's &quot;Examination  Day&quot; is famous but doesn't really work.  Its surprise ending is  probably there to make a satirical point but about what, exactly, is  unclear.<br />Robert Sheckley's &quot;The Cruel Equations&quot;, though, is a  clever and funny story about an inflexible guard robot and the man who has  forgotten his password but must pass by it -- or die on a desert  world.<br />Not every story is perfect but, with the exception of Slesar's and  Anvil's, they're all worth reading, and readers should, especially with the  Wellen stories, find some overlooked gems here.	2000-08-27

A project to boost  photosynthesis has gone out of control and rendered Eurasia and Africa  uninhabitable due to a runaway jungle.  Largely primitive humans live on  the rest of the globe.  The souls of the dying are radioed to the City of  the Dead on Mercury where they participate in elaborate computer games  until someone chooses to reincarnate them in another body.  Added to this  mix are &quot;fictoids&quot;, software imitations of fictional and  historical personages.<br />The only thing really new Jennings throws in is  Earthstalk, a giant elevator into space.  When an almost forgotten probe  returns to Earth and announces it has seeded a colony world around Alpha  Centauri,  Senator Ramnis, a politician in the Hegemony, a culture of  mostly Edwardian-level technology, and a member of the preternaturally  lucky Souldancer tribe, decides that the Earthstalk would make a splendid  generation starship.  All he has to do is break it off its base and coerce  or persuade its native inhabitants, a wildly diverse lot, into going along  with the idea.<br />Unfortunately, while Jennings' elliptical, obscure prose  works at the length of a short story, a whole novel of confusing  manipulations and double dealings with the thinnest of explanations as to  motives is tedious and slow going and had me going back several times to  refresh my memory or to see if a plot development was adequately set up.   Even those who have readthe collection will probably find this one  confusing. There also isn't enough of the wild speculations that made THE  BUG LIFE CHRONICLES intriguing.  <br />Besides Senator Ramnis, Jennings brings  back many other characters from THE BUG LIFE CHRONICLES including Ramnis'  enemy, U Gyi, Olivia, Magda, Torfinn, Alice Spendlowe, and Cedric  Chittagong.  Only those who really, really want to continue the adventures  of these characters will want to read this novel.	2000-08-24

Uploaded human minds inhabiting the robots and computer networks of a civilization in the atmosphere of Jupiter.  Sneering at those  still living in the &quot;meat&quot;, they bombard the inner solar system  with computer and &quot;mind viruses.&quot;  They brought on the Collapse,  the destruction of man's computer-dependent civilization, and ushered in  the age of the Solar Union, a socialist anarchy.<br />But some in the Union  have had enough of the post-human threat, namely the Cassini Division,  self-appointed cold warriors manning their version of the Berlin Wall on  Jupiter's moon, Callisto.  They want to wipe out the Jovians once and for  all with a cometary bombardment.  And they aren't listening to any  arguments from &quot;appeasers&quot; or those who think the Jovians are  sentient and deserve to live or don't pose a threat.<br />Ambiguity, irony,  and philosophical debate make up a lot of this book, but it's not a dry  tome unlike the many utopian and dystopian novels that supply several of  Macleod's chapter headings.  Macleod keeps the arguments short, the action  coming, and shifts the scenery frequently from a pastoral London inhabited  by the few die-hard capitalists to Callisto and, eventually, New Mars,  man's sole outpost beyond our solar system.<br />The narrator, Ellen May  Ngewthu, is engaging, fun, witty, and hard-edged.  She's given herself the  job of wiping out the Jovian post-humans, and she's willing to go to a lot  of trouble to finish the job.  She gets into a lot of arguments in the  book:  about the virtue of socialist anarchy versus the capitalist anarchy  of New Mars, the sentience of those beings with uploaded minds, and whether  the universe has any moral rule other than doing whatever you can get away  with.<br />Macleod explores some of the implications in the ideas of Vernor  Vinge's Singularity and copied, uploaded, and indentured minds familiar to  readers of Phillip C. Jennings.  This is a short book.  The superscience  isn't as astonishing as Peter Hamilton's work, but Macleod keeps his tale  interesting and knows how to write a philosophical tale that  moves.<br />Readers of George Zebrowski and Charles Pellegrino's THE KILLING  STAR should especially like this, another novel where genocide is shown to  have an unplesantly rational aspect to it.  <br />This is the third book in a  series.  I haven't read the first two since this was the first published in  America.  But I had no trouble following the story or assimilating the  background.	2000-08-07
US	52939892	R35U89K28V5A6	0380708035	799987862	1968	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A compelling read with some autobiographical material.	Fans of Haldeman's science fiction might be expecting an autobiographical novel when they find out that this is the story of a nineteen year old draftee who serves as a combat engineer in the Vietnam of 1968.  That was  the year Haldeman was a combat engineer there, and, like protagonist  Spider, he was wounded then.  But much of the novel doesn't seem  specifically autobiographical though Haldeman's lean prose certainly uses  his own experiences to recreate everything from the details of Vietnam's  red soil, the contents of an engineer's demolition pack while on patrol,  boobytraps, and the workings and non-workings of various weapons.   Haldeman's dry, ironic prose has the right air of understatement for  horrors that need no exaggeration.  Science fiction fans will also be  interested to see how the horrors that drove Spider psychotic are worked  into the genre fiction he writes at his therapist's request.<br />Haldeman's  most famous work, THE FOREVER WAR, was a metaphoric look at Vietnam.  Here  he shuns obliqueness to recreate an America at war.  Using the novelistic  techniques of Dos Passos, we learn about the persons and events of the time  in documentary sections interspersed between accounts of Spider and his one  time girlfriend, Beverly, whose journey skims the oceans of political  dissent and counterculture existing on the homefront. Spider's troubles are  only beginning when he's evacuated back home after being wounded in an  ambush that wipes out most of his patrol.  The entropic workings of  bureaucracy and malfunctioning machinery coincide to strip him of home,  family, friends, and gainful employment.  Only rarely does coincidence --  and Haldeman's coincidences are always plausible -- work in his favor.  One  instance leads to the book's powerful ending.<br />Anyone seeking a compelling  account of the year or any fan of Haldeman will want to read this  novel.<br />My only complaint is that I would have liked to continue some of  the characters'lives past 1968, but Haldeman is faithful to the title and  ends his novel on Dec. 31, 1968.	2000-08-01

There is really only one chapter, &quot;Crossing the Fence&quot; with its details of SOG operations  in Laos, that fits that bill.  What Shultz details, using unprecedented  access to recently declassified Pentagon documents and interviews with many  of the participants in SOG operations, is the complete story of the origin,  operations, successes, failures, and lessons of the Studies and  Observations Group.  His prose may not be scintillating, he may repeat  himself frequently, and the beginning of the book may bog down occasionally  with flow charts of command, but Shultz isn't writing a popular history.   He's writing a policy review of SOG's operations for future civilian and  military leaders who may turn to covert operations and unconventional  warfare to get themselves out of diplomatic binds.  The final chapter of  the book summarizes these lessons.<br />Still, this book is worthwhile reading  even for ordinary civilians.<br />Those interested in espionage history will  find a fascinating account of SOG's attempts to foster rebellion in North  Vietnam and wage psychological warfare.  Not only do we learn why the CIA  could not start a resistance movement in the &quot;denied&quot; country of  North Vietnam, a &quot;counterintelligence state&quot; of extreme paranoia  and security, but why the inheritor of the project, SOG, was also doomed to  fail and fail spectacularly.  Of approximately 500 agents inserted into  North Vietnam, all were killed or captured and many turned into double  agents.  <br />But SOG officers experienced in espionage turned this disaster  into a brilliant operation that convinced North Vietnam a massive  underground was operating in their country and loyal North Vietnamese were  implicated as traitors.  For those wanting to know exactly what is  encompassed by the term &quot;psychological warfare&quot;, Shultz gives  someidea in the chapter &quot;Drive Them Crazy with Psywar&quot;.  SOG set  up a fake resistance movement with accompanying bogus radio traffic,  propaganda, and blocks of ice parachuted into the jungle to melt and leave  empty chutes and an uneasy feeling amongst the North Vietnamese.<br />Shultz  also tells of the few maritime operations SOG carried out against enemy  targets, its sabotage efforts which included tainting caches of the enemy's  rice and leaving behind tainted ammo for the VC and NVA soldiers, and its  operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail.<br />But the documentation on SOG  was initially classified for a reason.  Ultimately, the program was a  failure, and Shultz documents how there's plenty of blame to go around.   Civilian leadership in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations micromanaged  the program, had unrealistic expectations for its speed and efficacy, and  held the bizarre belief that covert means should be congruent with overt  public policy.  Military leadership at the highest levels set up SOG as a  sop to civilian leaders whom they thought naively enamored of special  warfare.  They expected little from it, provided little by way of support,  and had no plan to coordinate SOG's efforts into the grand Vietnam  strategy.  Shultz also points out that special ops was, far from being a  glamorous, honored posting, a career stopper for a professional military  man.<br />While Shultz, of course, concentrates on SOG, I also learned a fair  amount about the diplomatic, political, and military history of the Vietnam  war in general.  Prior to this, my only exposure to the war, in book form,  had been a biography of Carlos Hathcock, the Marine sniper in  Vietnam.<br />The book is a bit slow at times, but it rewards the reader who  completes it.	2000-07-31

There's that dead reporter in the bathtub.  He was working on something called the Octopus file involving stolen software and arms smuggling.  And what about those machines in the polling booth?  Are they really counting your vote?  There's the &quot;Fighting Quaker&quot; who stopped a cabal of American fascists from overthrowing FDR.  Who really did the killings at Jonestown?  Is fluoride not a plot to steal our precious bodily fluids but to sell us more candy?<br />  You get a briefing on 50 conspiracies and suggestions for further reading, so, the next time someone at a party begins to go on about their favorite conspiracy (and doesn't everyone have at least one?), you'll be able to look them square in the eye and say, &quot;Well, I have a theory	1997-10-18
US	52939892	R3U0OFWEGPLH67	0812538757	993033048	The Probability Broach	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Good alternate history marred by echoes of the seventies.	THE PROBABILITY BROACH is as close to a libertarian utopia as any realistic anarchist dares get.  It's also a very detailed alternate history.  Most writers of alternate history are content to detail when that history deviates from ours or set their stories in the resulting world with brief references to how things change.  Smith  gives us a detailed timeline of how things change when one extra word is added to the Declaration of  Independence and George Washington is shot in the Whiskey Rebellion.<br />  However, Smith unsuccessfully tries for a Heinlein style.  His slang is awkward.  The hero's romance reeks of bad Chandler imitations, and there is a little bit too much gun stuff even for me, a lifetime NRA member.<br />  This book was originally published in 1980, and there are jarring elements of the seventies here which don't quite work like a tyrannical America justified by an energy crisis or the talking chimps and dolphins much loved in seventies' sf.<br />	1997-10-15

A St. Louis trashed out from an earthquake on the New Madrid fault in 2012 and under the management of the sinister Emergency Relief Agency forms the backdrop to this well done thriller.<br />  When dead scientists start turning up, Gerry Rosen, reporter for an alternate weekly, realizes that a local defense contractor and the ERA have something to hide.  That something isn't a new idea to science fiction, but Steele still tells an exciting story greatly helped out by the setting of a devastated St. Louis occuppied by government thugs.<br />	1997-10-05

If you haven't read Kim Stanley Robinson's &quot;Red Mars&quot; and &quot;Green Mars&quot;, don't even think about reading the last book in the trilogy, &quot;Blue Mars&quot;.  Instead, get those books immediately.  There are very few books that can unequivocally be labelled, immediately upon their publication, as classics. These three can be.  There's a reason this series has been awarded two Hugos and one Nebula.<br />  For those who have read those other novels, you will not be disappointed by &quot;Green Mars&quot;.  It is the same rich mix of science, politics, loving descriptions of landscape, and human drama as the other books.  (These are the only novels I can think of where an index would be worthwhile.)  On the political front, Mars holds a constitutional government and has to deal with the problems of Earth wanting to dump their surplus population there.  Sax Russell, the archetypal man of science, puts his formidable talents to work on stopping &quot;the quick decline&quot;, a syndrome of memory blackouts, rapid physical de	1997-09-27

In &quot;Images&quot; what a battle-scarred 'Nam veteran sees while he secretly watches the actresses of his theater company undress makes up for the somewhat contrived plot of oh-so-compatible love.  &quot;The Monster&quot; is a Lovecraftian tale about an imprisoned man narrating how he discovered an unearthly presence in a remote area, Vietnam, and how it destroyed his life.  Of course, he comes to a bad end.  The story is also interesting for what Haldeman has to say about the reality of the much glamorized Long Range Recon Patrols of the Vietnam War.  &quot;Graves&quot; is the most vivid distillation of Haldeman's war experiences even though he says he made	1997-09-24
