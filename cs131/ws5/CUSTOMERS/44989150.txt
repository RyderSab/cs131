Piven and Cloward discuss the declining voter participation in the American democracy, attributing that decline to the parties demobilization of the American electorate and inability to remobilize.  The authors argue that the declining voter participation is related to the lack of adequate and effective legislation, declining union membership, declining worker benefits and bargaining ability with free trade, and the exploitation of one class against another. The authors assert that the Democratic and Republican parties have no intention in actually remobilizing the electorate as new voters will change the current political game and add uncertainty to the incumbents reelections.	2002-04-03

Philosophers ranging Aristotle to Rousseau understood the importance of music in arousing or pacifying emotions. Holloway offers a very convincing illustration of the effects of music upon the characters of individuals. Music is filled with explicit language, verbal images of gratuituous sexual conduct, and the pleasurable experiences of narcotic abuses. In being over-exposed to this kind of music, the current generation has become accustomed to expecting extreme methods of gratifying oneself. This over-gratification has lead to an experimentation with new methods of gratification, more extreme and effective than the preceding methods.  Holloway doesn't really discuss what should be done to remedy this trend nor does he suggest censorship.  Also, the book was lacking a global philosophical approach as asian philosophical teachings concerning music were omitted from the book.	2001-04-16
