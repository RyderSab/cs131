Unfortunately the book is marred by a nasty sarcastic tone that will turn off a lot of people who really need to read a book like this. The book is at its weakest when it goes off on tangent at the end and starts talking about UFO's, NDE's etc. The author really loses some serious credibility with his lack of objectivism about these topics. Bottom line: this book didn't live up to its potential.	2004-07-06

He is even upfront about his bias that he really wants to believe in the existence of God. I believe this bias is most evident when he tells us that he believes the gospel accounts are a credible account of Jesus' life. I have spent the last eighteen months reading and pondering this issue and have come to the opposite conclusion. It is interesting how the author delicately tiptoes around the issues of whether or not Jesus actually performed miracles. In fact in an interview given on the net (Beliefnet) he says he is &quot;agnostic&quot; about Jesus' miracles. Now how can he say that if he believes the gospels to be reasonably accurate accounts of Jesus' life? I agree that the central message of the gospels is not about Jesus' ability to perform miracles, but if there is doubt about whether he even performed them then how can anyone not reasonably doubt many of the other things in the gospels? <BR>The author likes to concentrate on many of Jesus' positive ethical teachings but somehow manages to omit Jesus' repeated threats of eternal hell in his teachings. <BR>In the end the author ends up with a kind of &quot;cafeteria theology&quot;. It's inoffensive but uncompelling.	2004-06-16

But to imply that the stories in the Bible were written as a kind of collection of &quot;myths&quot; which nevertheless contain wonderful lessons we can learn from is absurd. Why then all the admonishments in the New Testament like &quot;this is written so that you shall believe&quot;? You are very, very wrong Mr. Harpur. Most of the Bible was meant to be taken VERY literally. Problem is that a literal reading of the Bible is incompatible with a modern worldview, so Mr. Harpur like other liberal theologians has to envelope himself in a theology which is little more than conjecture and personal opinion.	2004-04-24

The authors make it sound like there is no objective scientific evidence for anything that psychology and psychiatry say and that it all rests upon  the subjective musings of mental health professionals. I guess they haven't heard of the amazing things we are starting to learn about the brain with techniques like P.E.T. scans. The analogy of expecting the same diagnostic process with an assessment of an ankle injury and a behavioural disorder is like trying to compare the techniques of making a paper airlane with assembling a 747.The book as well is littered with anecdotes and quotes favourable to the authors' position. It is not a balanced review.<BR>The author likes to harp on the over prescription of psychoactive medicine and YES they are at times inappropriately prescribed but to dismiss them totally out of hand is irresponsable. I have seen many people do fabulously well on medication and no they haven't suffered &quot;permanent brain damage&quot;. <BR>Ultimately this book is mostly fundamentalist religious propaganda. If you believe in a literal Adam and Eve,talking serpents and that Isaiah 7:14 foretells of Jesus then this book is for you. <BR>If you want a serious review of the pros and cons of mental health issues look elsewhere.<BR>And last but not least, I have seen many people pray for help  with their emotional problems but unfortunately it usually works no better than placebo.	2004-04-24

This book is an excellent overview of the results of modern scholarship as applied to the Bible. So why only 4 stars? Because like other liberal theologians, Laughlin somehow thinks you can remove most of the orthodox beliefs of Christianity and still have a viable version of Christianity. After his deconstruction you are left with: a)a God so ill defined as to be incomprehensible and essentially meaningless b) a Jesus (if you even believe he existed as a historical person) who is an inspirational teacher even though you're not sure how much of what is attributed to him is even factual c) a Bible which is a collection of fables which nevertheless has some kind of transcendental value.<BR>Liberal Christianity has no &quot;meat&quot; to it.

Goff doesn't believe that God directly intervenes in human affairs but in some mysterious way works through people. What proof does he offer for his theology? Precious little.  A lot of his suggestions on how to live your life are very good, but by the end of the book you feel that God is just an unnecessary appendage to a rather secular humanist philosophy.

The author like many of his ilk tries to fall back on a line of thinking which is kind of like &quot;because science doesn't know everything about everything you should therefore accord my worldview a certain legitimacy by default&quot;. <BR>Sometimes the author is just clearly misinformed such as when on p. 446 he says &quot;&quot;There has only ever been a single occasion when water was allegedly turned into wine......&quot; Sorry Dr. Alexander but a little reading of ancient and mystery religions would refute that point quite nicely. Dr. Alexander of course might respond that in Jesus' case this really happened whereas the other accounts are just &quot;myth and legends&quot;.<BR>As someone who works in the field of science, the only concept of God I can even begin to believe in is the Deist one.

It's a breath of fresh air to the platitudes such as &quot;just pray harder&quot; that are thrown out at people who struggle with their faith. Several reviewers have stated that Yancey offers no easy answers. I would go one step further and say he offers no answers at all. When you distill his thoughts down, it still seems to boil down to &quot;have faith and God will make it right in the end&quot;.<BR>It some how seems difficult to fathom a God who creates an intricate and complex universe, which can nevertheless be gradually studied and understood, yet the relationship this God has with humanity is as tortured,confused and unclear as it was 2,000 years ago. It seems that far better men and women than me have tried to get to know God and failed. Maybe we're chasing the unknowable or the non existent.	2003-07-12

I'ts obvious that his bible interpretation is a literalist,inerrant view most compatible with conservative evangelicism or fundamentalism. As such it repeatedly leaves itself open to attack of the historicity of certain events in the bible.<BR>The worst section of the book is clearly the one on science and religion. To imply that the age of the earth is a question still open because of uncertainties in geology is just intellectually <BR>dishonest. There was good evidence through geology about the old nature of the earth long before even the first edition of this book came out.<BR>As well there has been evidence found about transitional life forms in fossils (nowhere complete yet I will admit).<BR>When you see that he is quoting Michael Behe and Hugh Ross you know well, that just about does the chapter in.

That said however there are some significant shortcomings as well.<BR>Borg obviously doesn't believe in miracles. This is curious for at least two reasons. First if there is an omnipotent God miracles are certainly possible (doesn't mean however that God actually has to &quot;perform' them however). Secondly he professes his belief in the paranormal, which seems hard to fathom given his disbelief in miracles. There seems to be an intellectual dishonesty here somehow. Thirdly he likes to invoke the concept (per Crossan) of &quot;divine consistency&quot; which basically says if miracles were happening then they should be happening now and if they aren't........A good counterpoint to this argument can be found in Philip Yancey's Disappointment with God.<BR>As well Borg seems too quick to dispell the historical factness of events especially in the Gospels. Repeatedly he asserts that it doesn't matter if this or that actually happened and then goes on to provide his metaphorical analysis. I would argue that in some instances it DOES matter a lot. If the resurrection story is not factual then christianity is a con job of spectacular proportions and its basis as a legitimate religion is invalid despite ANY good that may have been done in its name.<BR>Borg also seems to see all religions as equally valid ignoring that there are major differences in their teachings. It would almost be more intellectually honest to call them all &quot;bunk&quot; than to say they are all the same.<BR>A good book for generating discussion but with some significant flaws.	2003-07-04

It does raise a lot of troubling questions as to how humans view God and you almost end up feeling we don't know &quot;him&quot; at all. Yancey tries to show that miracles in the old testament genre don't happen anymore because they didn't increase the faithfulness of Israel (which may tie in with Jesus' reluctance to perform them at times as well). Instead of knowing God through miracles we are supposed to know him by &quot;faith&quot;. Yet one could easily argue that Richard, the theology student in the beginning of the book, had, at least at certain times in his life, sufficient faith that he should have &quot;known&quot; God but somehow it seems like he really never did. Why?<BR>If as Yancey suggests, miracles (as interpreted as direct physical interventions from God) don't happen anymore, then why bother to pray for the &quot;miraculous&quot; healing of someone in your congregation? Or is the act of praying meaningful because it exemplifies &quot;faith&quot;? Or is it ultimately just a coping mechanism for physical and emotional pain?<BR>Some of the difficulty may stem from the fact that Yancey obviously reads the bible from a fairly literalist point of view. In my experience this inevitably leads to having to do an inordinate amount of mental gymnastics, which ultimately leaves you frustrated and confused.<BR>Maybe we really don't know &quot;God&quot; at all.	2003-07-03

Unfortunately most of these have watered down the definitions of miraculous and angelic to such a low common denominator, that they are applied to any positive life experience no matter how trivial. As mainstream religion continues to fade in support, a variety of New Age mysticisms rush in to fill the obvious spiritual void that many people feel. Problem is this usually leaves people with an ego centric \\"feel-good\\" spirituality and nothing more. <BR>Case in point, the story in this book from a lady in Florida who has both a \\"parking angel\\" who always helps her to find a parking spot and a \\"shopping angel\\" who helps her find difficult to find items and at a discount too! I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry at this point. I'm sure that whenever these epiphanies happen to this lady there is some poor child in the world being hit by a car, being assaulted etc. But I guess the \\"shopping angel\\" was too busy to help. <BR>Lady you're suffering from a narcisstic, materialistic delusional disorder.
