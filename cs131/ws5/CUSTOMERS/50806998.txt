It was a great read. If you have read \\"We Were the Mulvaney's\\" by Joyce Carol Oats and liked it, you'll like this book.<br />This book deals with the question \\"when bad things happen to good people what happens next?\\"  The oldest son from this family simply dissapears one day, never to be found.  The book is sad, but not in a depressing way, eventually the family \\"heals\\" and does what each needs to do to move on.<br />A great read!	2002-06-03

Not bad at all. I was wary because the movie looked overly sappy and retarded,  the book is none of those things.  This is a fantastic read, all at once funny and heartbreakingly sad.  The main character, Novalee Nation is a strong and proud heroine.  This is a terrific beach read (or a saturday afternoon find!)	2002-05-31

I hope that in the future she would write more about these characters since one of the main plot points is still unresolved.<br />This is an admirable 1st work.	2002-05-30

Its a great read and a terrific re-read that always energizes me to start reading books again.  A terrific look at a poor family in Brooklyn, NY at the turn of the century; a Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a classic novel of hope and imagination.  Betty Smith is a fab. writer.	2002-05-29

If you get this book looking for the action and adventure of Ender's Game, you will need to read some other book.<br />I look at this book as a needed step in the series but not the best work overall.	2002-05-24

Im sure many people bought or will buy this based on that fact.  The truth of it all is that Mr. Rice is a darn good scribe in his own right.

Hamilton when a friend passed me her 1st 3 Anita Blake novels in one HC edition.  I was hooked.  If you like the goth-vampire-Buffy/Angel scene then she is totally the writer for you.<br />I was impressed with her use of Faery lore (similar to another favorite author of mine, Patricia Morrison) in a modern day setting.  She has created another terrific world and an engaging new series!	2002-05-23
