US	52498371	RV8BX40SMKJDX	0385418868	26788304	The Power of Myth	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Mind Expanding	The Power of Myth was written to provide another paradigm that you could interpret your existence by. It succeeds. While this is not new, due to the  source material being from various era's, the freshness and relevance is  unmistakeable. Criticism has been directed at its supposed New Age content.  This is terribly unjustified. Christianity has a tendency to label and  condemn that which is different from itself, typically this is a reaction  to what is perceived as a threat. Subscribing to Campbell's  religion/theology/mythology should not be precursor for reading The Power  of Myth. Read and interpret your own life under its scope. Recommended for  everyone.	2000-08-02

Our only hope to understand all that is out there is through books. Vicariously we can at least partial understand the suffering  in our world. Black Like Me is one of the better inside looks at a  particular reality. Griffin sunned and dyed himself black and went into the  deep south to experience life as a black man. The book is a revelation of  human nature. Written as a diary it is hard not to symphathize with the  situation described. Everything should read.	2000-07-30

Devotees have responded by saying that that criticism misses the point precisely. My advice would be to look for the cumulative effect. Compared  with great literature On the Road is lacking, but it was not intended to  be. Rather, examine On the Road as a slice of life. Ideally, your  experience reading On the Road would be life-changing, but each of us is at  different stages of life and therefore, we cannot experience it uniformly.  Everyone should read Kerouac, to get a glimpse of history and maybe to  understand a generation, another time. Recommended for anyone high school  and up.	2000-07-29

Beside being an invaluable reference for cinema between 1929-1968, it also contains wonderful peices of film theory. Because of this The American  Cinema can be read a few pages at a time or you can completely dwelve into  the material. No matter the method, Sarris will engage you in a meaningful  dialogue of film. Film literature is rarely able to be this give and take.  Those with an above average inclination toward cinema should purchase.	2000-07-28

Society is destroying tradition and has yet to offer a suitable replacement. In The Razor's Edge Larry Darrell is a man seeking a  practical way of living. Unable to devote himself to a particular philosopy  or religion he continually seeks. The Razor's Edge is that tale.<br />After  reading I was amazed at the reflection I saw between Larry, myself, and my  friends. Larry is trying to accomplish what all of us are trying to  accomplish. Call it what you want, peace of mind, religion, personal  philosophy, we are all searching, trying to live life right. Recommended.	2000-07-28

I was wrong.<br />Though, this book is not  bad. Many reviews have made it seem to be laugh out loud funny. Once or  twice maybe, but not all the time. Boredom was not an issue, but neither  was laughter. An enjoyable piece, just not great.<br />The gist of the book is  this: guy grand buys people.

After I left to go to college I never forget about Wavy. Bored one day I surfed the internet and learned that Wavy had written  a book or two. Immediately I came here to purchase one, but was denied  because it is out of print. Due to perserverence I managed to find one at a  used book shop.<br />Oh my. I had no clue that the history of this man was so  compelling. The various events and activities that he has been involved in  are incredible, it seems as if Wavy has had a hand in every major counter  culture event of the past thirty years. <br />This book is not normal. Part  diary, part narrative, part fun. I recommend this book to all who show a  passing interest.	2000-07-26

That said, Lewis is at his best here. Truly the ability to write with any sort of lucidity and laconicity about Christ and  Christianity is a most admirable trait.

Sure Harris outlines a noble lifestyle, one that could help if more people implemented  it into their lifes. I have a few qualms with I kissed dating goodbye,  below is a list of them.<br />1) Harris presupposes that humans are depraved.  Yes, there are a few bad apples, but not all of us are corrupt. Implicit in  the pages of I kissed dating goodbye is a contempt for human nature. While  misguided, I cannot accept that Humanity is naturally bad.<br />2) Poor  theology. Often the evangelical speakers have a stock vocabulary that if  scrutinized borders between calvinism and devotional theology. &quot;I  don't get in the way of what God is doing.&quot; &quot;He's shaping and  molding her into something special.&quot; Both lines are from the book.  This seems to me to contradict the question in the foreword and echo the  tenets of calvinsim. Check his scripture usage and you'll find that it also  isn't too expertly done(though some slack can be cut because all  denominations have their own interpretations of scripture and thus can't  agree). <br />3) He quits on the reader. Page 205, &quot;The Bible doesn't  provide a one size fits all program for moving from friendship to  marriage.&quot; Relating to the above, I was surprised by this because  Harris had demonstrated remarkable creativity in justifiy his views with  biblical verses that I was dumbfounded that he could not find a verse  supporting his beliefs here. <br />Basically it amounts to this: Harris  diagrams a great philosophy. His execution is horid. Harris cannot be held  culpable for I kissed dating goodbye. Christians should read the BIBLE to  find their answers instead of having someone interpret it. So go on, pick  up the good book, turn to Matthew and start reading. It'll be the best  thing you ever did.	2000-07-26

A professor of New Testament at a Theological Seminary should certainly realize that the problem is not a literary one. Let me explain. The synoptic problem, as  defined by the book, is why luke, mark, and matthew look so much alike.  Many possible solutions exist but none have been proven. My concern is what  will be gained if this problem is solved? Maybe we could better ascertain  the theological preferences of the evangelists but then we will have a  bigger problem harmonizing those idiosyncracies then we do now. Beyond  that, there is no advantage. For what it is the book does introduce and  explain the theories and such, but don't devote your life too it. Too many  great minds do alrighty.	2000-07-26

Admittedly,  I was hooked.<br />I should have realized that this could not be fully  realized. Strobel does not &quot;prove&quot; Christ. In fact he does little  to establish anything beyond what we know from the Bible. The reality is  that the journey that morphed into The Case for Christ eventuated as an  explaination of doctrine. Once I relinquished my frustration from  unfulfilled expectations, The Case for Christ was provoking and readable.  Buy it, with the correct expectations.	2000-07-23

There is not a more accurate description of his writings contained in &quot;A Great and Glorious Game.&quot; <br />What  seperated Giamatti from others of like mind was his ability to act upon his  impulses. Most famously, banishing Pete Rose from ever being associated  with baseball again. An incredible unfortunate situation, but to all those  who cannot accept Giamatti's judgment please read this book. For myself it  clarified his motives and subsequent actions. <br />Beyond anything to do with  Rose, this book is thoroughly engaging.
