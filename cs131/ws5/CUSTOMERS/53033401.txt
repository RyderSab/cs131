But he seems to fall into an imitation of Wingfield's Frost books, with fairly similar  characters, including his protagonist Logan Macrae, and a very similar plot structure (multiple story lines, many with predictable outcomes). There was no real edge to this novel--as if Macbride couldn't decide if he was writing a satiric-comic story or a serious police procedural.	2005-09-04
US	53033401	R1QBDXWX7NNI8E	0393059227	545162178	The Sari Shop	Books	2	3	9	N	N	Disappointing debut	With a great title and subject, it's too bad Bajwa couldn't turn out a novel of greater interest and skill. Ramchand, the main character, is just not interesting enough to carry the weight of the story, and his central perspective limits the story's range. Her most believable characters were the middle-class ladies; they could have appeared more prominently. Her upper-class belles were soap-opera concoctions. A Fine Balance, The Namesake and Brick Lane all have far more merit.	2004-07-19

Having recently enjoyed the Hornblower books, and Sharpe and Hornblower video series, I decided to give my library-sale copy a try.  I read it on vacation this past week and truly enjoyed it.  The story of the seven comrades drew me into the story of the war from a French perspective (moderated, of course, by Delderfield's inherent Britishness).  While steering away from melodrama, I would not consider the book at all &quot;plodding,&quot; as another reviwer put it.  The scenes featuring Napoleon brought on the tingles created by the best of fiction or drama.  Recommended.	2003-07-14

This book shows real talent in creating a sense of place and mood, but I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters enough to finish the story.  With Perfect Love, her next book, Buchan found a more sympathetic voice--recommended.	2002-09-19

Buchan is a talented writer, and her descriptive powers are demonstarted in both books, but Consider the Lily is depressing, with no characters to capture the reader's sympathies.  This book reminded me of Joanna Trollope more than Rosamund Pilcher, but readers of either will enjoy this story.  I look forward now to reading Ms. Buchan's later books.	2002-09-19

Carter has loads of talent but could have used a stronger editor, as others have noted.  the story just went on too long on the same note.

The ultimate plot solution is little strained, but I'd much rather compromise on the crime's &quot;destination&quot; than on the journey there.  I vehemently disagree with the earlier reviewer who found Frost self-centered and disgusting.  Self-deprecating would be much closer to the truth--a very sympathetic character.	2002-02-13

I remember trying this book as a girl and disliking it; I gave it another try now on vacation, at the age of 47.  I still dislike it.  The characters are caricatures and speak in stilted dialogue unlike that of any real people--much less interesting people.  Don't misunderstand--I like good nineteenth century novels.  In fact, I love Dickens, Trollope, the Brontes, George Eliot, Mrs. Gaskell, etc.  This book is a pale imitation of those--a mere period piece.	2002-02-05

But the &quot;romance&quot; element in this book is pretty dreadful--&quot;Cat&quot; and &quot;Daig,&quot; as well as Robbie and Jean, are totally unbelievable characters in any historical period.

The writing was restrained and displayed an authentic voice.  But Falling Angels was a disappointment--I realised after about 60 pages that I had no real interest in the story or characters, all of whom came across like twentieth-century retreads of Edwardian stereotypes.  So I skipped to the end to see what narrative point all of the build-up had been heading to--pretty predictable stuff.	2001-11-22

And the war-time characters and period detail wore thin.  I was skimming by the end.	2001-07-01

Comparisons to Narnia or even The Golden Compass are incredible.	2001-02-04

There's a lot of promise here, and Cusk has occasionally brilliant observations (for instance, her description of the days of the workweek). But the prose overall is convoluted and difficult to read, and there is not enough to like in any of the characters to stick with it for  200+ pages. (Actually my copy had about 40 pages printed twice, missing another 40 or so--but I don't think those 40 were any different, and I was skimming by then.)	2001-01-29

That is, I spent about 40 minutes actually reading the first 60 pages, then skimmed the rest to see if it seemed to get any better. It didn't. Stone has a wooden hand with dialogue and a melodramatic approach to character and plot. She goes on my &quot;avoid&quot; list.	2000-11-13

I'm of two minds about this book and its sequel (I haven't read the third  yet). It's very well-written--Cornwell has a graceful style in both  description and dialogue. I love retellings of the Arthur legend. But  perhaps this is just one too many. While I admire the book, I put it down  easily and don't really look forward to resuming the story, as I do with my  favorites. I definitely recommend the series--it just doesn't make the hair  stand up on the back of my neck, I guess.	2000-08-24

One wrote the Williamsburg novels, The Tudor Wench and Queen's Folly. Someone else wrote Tryst, The Lost General, Remember the Day,Cloth of Gold  etc.The first set of books are characterized by believable characters, good  dialogue, a strong sense of place, and interesting plots. Their  &quot;romance&quot; builds from the ground up. The second set are basically  trite and silly, full of breathless melodrama. I just finished The Lost  General, hoping to find a book in her first &quot;set.&quot; It was OK but  at about the level of the romance stories I used to read in Good  Housekeeping magazine as a teenager. Cloth of Gold is truly one of the most  annoying books I've tried to read this year--I stopped after 100 pages or  so.	2000-01-27

I love Angela Thirkell's books--she is one of my favorite authors along with Trollope and Austen. But she wrote a few clinkers, and this is one of them. I would have guessed that Georgette Heyer wrote this book, in a blind  test. It has all the cloying archness of the (only) book by Heyer I read  and which I forever associate with Regency romances. Of course, this IS a  Regency romance--NOT one of her wonderful Barsetshire books, so maybe it  was a misguided experiment.	1999-12-23

I was disappointed. The book started well but became  formulaic fairly early. There was little fresh or engaging about the  characters; the whole thing felt &quot;forced cute.&quot; Nowhere did I  feel any chord of real emotional response--fear, awe, wonder--which  characterises the other books I mentioned. I skimmed the last 75 pages or  so just to reach closure on &quot;what happened.&quot; If I had a child of  the right age I would read this book to him/her, as it's better than  average, but my guess is that very few young readers will find it is a book  they come back to in later years.	1999-06-10

Katie Fforde has a pleasant writing style and the start of the book was it's strong suit--zippy opening, then cozy as Hetty settles into her uncle's house. I started to get somewhat bored when I realised neither incidents  (the mysterious loan, for instance) nor characters  (Peter, for instance)  were going to receive any sustained development. I'm not looking for War  and Peace here but she introduces elements and drops them for all intents  and purposes. Why was the loan taken out? What were the dire consequences  of non-payment? Why didn't she have a simple conversation with the lender  about it? Was the lender legit or a mobster? Etc. What was Peter all about.  There seemed to be something sinister about him at first and then he just  becomes the jolly neighbor. The romantic element of the book was a bit  silly--moved into heavy breathing territory. I bought a second book by  Fforde on the strength of the opening of this one--I hope I enjoy it  &quot;whole&quot; a bit more than Stately Designs.	1999-03-10
US	53033401	R3IAL2C6ON1GGL	0553572997	501395694	The Alienist	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Not worth the effort	This is the sort of book that offers two things--a plot solution (who, what, why) and lots of history about turn-of-the-century New York. I lost interest in both before I was halfway through (I turned to the end to see  if I'd missed anything and decided I hadn't). I can see where someone else  might find both interesting, but that someone has to put up with a lot of  wooden writing in the meantime. I don't like historical fiction in which  the main effort is to introduce historical figures or incidents in clever  ways. I'd rather read a biography or well-written history. I DO like  historical fiction that presents a single person or incident with a  freshness that makes them come alive again. This book failed to do that.  Edith Pargeter is an example of a writer who does this very successfully.	1999-01-26

But someone gave me a copy, and I resolved to at least give it a try. I was hooked after the first chapter.  Frazier writes beautifully, about people and the world they inhabit.

I read it shortly after reading &quot;Many Years From Now,&quot; which I thoroughly enjoyed. Don't bother with this one.  Obviously the only people who would talk to the author had an ax to grind  and a very inflated idea of themselves relative to Paul or the other  Beatles. The book would have been funny if it weren't so stupid. Paul and  Linda can't win for losing. For instance, their modest lifestyle is  criticized as being hypocritical, given their vast wealth. But in other  instances where they spend money in some noticeable way, they're criticized  for flaunting the wealth. To top it all off, Giuliano is a bad writer of  wooden prose--or does that cancel out to a &quot;good&quot; writer?	1999-01-04

I haven't read it since (yet), but I'll be surprised if my opinion will have changed when I do. Most of the books I loved then still hold up to a more mature  re-reading. So what is with everything else Mario Puzo has written? I tried  The Sicilian and thought it was laughable--something early he unearthed for  his publisher when fame struck. I tried The Fortunate Pilgrim, after  reading glowing reviews about his true &quot;masterpiece.&quot; I thought  it was pretentious and boring. Then this book--it reads like a novel  written after a teleplay to capture a miniseries audience of non-readers.  Don't bother--it's not even any fun.	1998-12-28
