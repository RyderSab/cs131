It is, however, as far from a legitimate martial art as it could be. The author is clearly not a ninjutsu practitioner.	1998-12-10

Hayes is a well respected martial arts teacher and lecturure.  Of course one cannot truly learn ninjutsu without a teacher, this book, and all of Hayes' books are very useful.	1998-12-10

The words within are cryptic, and should be studied very carfully.  This book will not teach you how to fight, you need a qualified teacher for that.  However, this book  provides priceless wisdom for serious students of Ninja arts.	1998-12-01

The idiot that said the techneques were &quot;watered down&quot; has no idea what real Taijutsu (the physical form of ninjutsu) looks like and further is obviously an apologist for  charletans like Ashida Kim, who have seen too much ninja turtles.	1998-12-01

Ashida Kim is very obviously not a REAL ninja. Period. He is a phoney, a fraud, a fake, a lier and a cheat.  So, if you bought his book you've been hoodwinked, bamboozled, hornswagled, and swindled.  He has no scrolls,  cannot trace his lineage and has no respected public following in Japan or  any other country.	1998-12-01
