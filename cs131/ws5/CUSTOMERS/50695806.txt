It's not by any means exhaustive or technical, but it reveals quite a bit about the nature of the game, and what it means to be stubbornly faithful to something that has never been faithful in return.<br /><br />There's a beautiful sense of heartbreak and ultimate redemption in this collection of daily jottings and musing from two Sox fans who also happen to be pretty good writers.<br /><br />King's entries tend toward the humorous (darkly so, when the Sox aren't performing), while O'Nan's reveal the traces of a born statistician.<br /><br />King once wrote a book about a group of losers who banded and as a team found the cobmined strength to beat the monster who lived in the sewer. Maybe he is repeating himself with FAITHFUL. But, what the hell, it's a good read.	2005-10-02

But it's one of those cases where the cumulative experience of the journey is worth more than the steep-grade labor exherted along the way.<br /><br />What's confounding is that the first hundred pages or so are very interesting and engaging, whetting your appetite for a quick and easy telling of the saga of the Buendia family.<br /><br />But then Garcia Marquez subtlely shifts gears, and the more you get to know the multi-generational Buendia clan, the less you seem to know them. The more you long to sink your teeth into juicy character specificity, the more you're left with desiccated symbolism and generational templates.<br /><br />Garcia Marquez achieves greatness in this book by managining to tell the story of a family (and by extension, all families) without ever getting very close to any of the members that make up the family. The book's power comes from its hypnotic, fuzzy insistence that its hero is the family itself, and that you can know everything about it, without really knowing anything about it.<br /><br />It's a both frustrating and inspiring reading experience, not unlike trying to find the rainbow above a lawn sprinkler.	2005-09-05

GHOST STORY was probably my favorite novel I'd read for quite a while as a teenager.<br /><br />I also loved the series of Tim Underhill-related novels Straub published in the late '80s and early '90s, including KOKO, MYSTERY, and THE THROAT. For a while, I felt Straub could do no wrong. He could be abstruse at times (as in his first short story collection, HOUSES WITHOUT DOORS), but the sheer quality of his prose always made me the journey was well worth it.<br /><br />I was less enthuiastic about THE HELLFIRE CLUB and the pursuent MR. X, and found the recent LOST BOY LOST GIRL to be downright disappointing.<br /><br />I was getting to the point where I wondered if Straub had Still had a great book in him.<br /><br />I don't think IN THE NIGHT ROOM is necessarily that great book I was starting to think might not come, but it's at least a movement in the right direction.<br /><br />The problem with some of LOST BOY LOST GIRL is that it lacked a sense of of groundedness. The prose is often beuatiful, but it just seemed to float beyond my ability to engage with it.<br /><br />IN THE NIGHT ROOM I feel is a sizeable improvement. It manages both a sense of the ghostly that Straub excels at and also the tangible that I feel has been lacking in his recent fiction.<br /><br />IN THE NIGHT ROOM is not Straub's best book ever, but it's probably his best book in a while, and it gives me hope for the future.	2005-08-21

If this book didn't carry the unfortunate weight around its neck of being the final in the Dark Tower series, I think I'd be much more enthuiastic about it. It's a fairly solid book--not one of King's best (I'd include It, parts of Hearts in Atlantis, Different Seasons, and The Shining in that list), but it's certainly nowhere near his worst.<br /><br />What's disappointing is that King had to know a few books back that there'd be no satisfying way to neatly end this massive story while still being true to the qualities that made it a worthwhile read. So he copped to that, and gave us a kind of non-ending. Which is cool, or not, depending on your ability to be cool with such a thing.<br /><br />I tend to think I'm cool with such philosophical handlings of events, but I have to admit, as a devoted listener of the storyteller, I found myself more than a little disppointed.<br /><br />It's a still a great story, and the way it ends shouldn't have a much of a bearing on that.<br /><br />I'm just happy that King is starting other stories. I'm really looking forward to reading THE COLORADO KID this fall, and THE CELL, or whatever he ends up calling it, next year, or whenever he ends up publishing it.<br /><br />Stephen King is a great writer...a truly great storyteller. He painted himself into a bit of a corner with this one, but damn, if you turn around, you can what a great painting it is.<br /><br />And there will be more stories to come. I'm definitely cool with that.	2005-08-18

I would often hear. Or, his essays are like chocolates that you just can't stop eating. He writes so truthfully about families. Everyone can relate.<br /><br />I respected the opinions of most of the people who were telling me these things, but I think I went so long without reading David Sedaris, with the knowledge that I SHOULD be reading him that I started to construct my own little defenses for why I hadn't gotten around to him.<br /><br />How could a large group of people all find the same thing funny without it necessarily being a watered-down least-common-denominator kind of funny, that despite people laughting at it, isn't actually funny at all?<br /><br />But I decided to finally confront my troubling preconceptions and put them in a brown paper bag with Sedaris's latest book itself, shake them up hard and see what came out.<br /><br />Well, see here's the thing...if you haven't read David Sedaris yet, you have to. He's so funny! His essays are like chocolates...<br /><br />I feel like a character in Invasion of the Body Snatchers after I've been taken out to the shed.<br /><br />But here it's David Sedaris, who may or may not be a space alien from a planet of born storytellers, who did the bewitching himself.<br /><br />Yes, he's funny. He's very funny. He manages it, by being truthful, incisive, witty, and by being himself.<br /><br />He does write well about the family, and it's something that everyone will relate to, and will find some different authentic way to laugh at.<br /><br />David Sedaris is a gifted writer, well worth your time and more than equal to any seemingly superlative hype heaped upon him.	2005-07-19

People won't nod their heads or shrug their shoulders, even if they don't agree. You're bound, instead, to get people either nodding their heads fervantly, or else just as fervantly wanting to bite your head off.<br /><br />But when I look back at what Clinton was able to accomplish for this country, what he at least tried to accomplish, and what he generally stood for,  I can't help but feel that he was one of the greatest public servants America had in the 20th century.<br /><br />Sure, he made mistakes, but I tend to think that the people who most vehemently loathe Clinton are the ones that maybe see more than a little of him in themselves. There's nothing like sublimated self-loathing to make people want to point fingers and blame.<br /><br />Bill Clinton is a flawed character, there is no question. In his personal life, in the way he ruled the country, in his foreign policy decisions,  he was never perfect. It's a valid complaint, I think, to say that Bill Clinton was too much of a politician at times, that he rode the fence too closely.<br /><br />But to me, his imperfections, coupled with his dogged determination to survive, to keep putting his clay feet one after the other in a direction that he never waivered in seeing as the right one, are what make him heroic.<br /><br />I do believe that Clinton always strove to do the best he could. I also believe that he messed up a lot along the way, but I think in the final analysis history will show that the good he did greatly outweighed the errors he commited along the way.<br /><br />This is a long read, but one well worth your time. I found MY LIFE at turns entertaining, inspiring, humbling, and informative..	2005-06-26

On a once-over at the music section, the text seemed clear and easy to follow and the book was filled with helpful illustrations and sidebars.<br /><br />I bought the book and took it home and at first was very happy with it, but the further I read, the more disenchanted I became.<br /><br />The main problem I had with this book is that it doesn't build on its own concepts at a sensible rate.  The authors frequently make frustrating leaps, introducing a concept in one chapter and then over-immersing the reader in it in the next.<br /><br />This book was almost helpful in many ways, but ultimately more frustrating than it was worth.  I think it could be improved, however, and made into a more useful guide, if the authors were to streamline the presentation of information and not using advanced concepts when the reader has not been adequately prepared for them.	2005-02-14

Almost there.<br /><br /> For those of us Constant Readers in Stephen King's ever-expanding ka-tet, the long, strange trip is almost over. This year, King will celebrate his 57th birthday (on September 21) by releasing the seventh and final DARK TOWER novel, titled simply THE DARK TOWER.<br /><br /> Rumor (fairly well founded, having been started by King himself) recently had it that once he reached the tower, the veteran wordslinger would hang up his nouns and verbs and ride quietly into the sunset.<br /><br /> Whether that proves true (even newer, equally well founded rumor has it he's working on a new post-Dark Tower novel) it's clear that King has come to a defining moment in his long, often entertaining, at times brilliant career.<br /><br /> What lies ahead is in someways the point of everything King's written up until now. There's been plenty of speculation over the years about what exactly the dark tower is and what the gunslinger Roland will find once he gets inside.<br /><br /> Until recently, King has been pretty vague about the specifics. After all, one might argue, any jounrey worth taking is not so much about the destination as it is about the journey itself.<br /><br /> But even the best journeys, both literal and artistic, yearn for some kind of resolution to lend them shape and meaning. For Roland and his gunslinger friends, Jake, Eddie, and Susannah, that ending is finally close at hand.<br /><br /> They, along with us Constant Readers, are finally standing in the full shadow of the dark tower.<br /><br /> At arm's-length, the tower as a metaphoric binding axle at the center of all possible worlds is all fine and good, but up close and personal, what exactly is this dark mystery standing at the heart of everything?<br /><br /> King started leaving some pretty big clues suggesting how it will all end in the brilliant fifth book of the series, WOLVES OF THE CALLA. Many readers were angered that he decided to include himself as a major character in the story.<br /><br /> It was certainly a bold narrative decision on King's part, about which it's difficult to remain neutral. I find myself in the other camp that regards the move as both a fascinating and necesarry part of the journey.<br /><br /> If a good story can be judged in part by how well it keeps its readers guessing along the path to an inevitable conclusion, then the last two Dark Tower books have been prime specimens of good storytelling. When you add to that King's ever-increasing ability to get at the subtlety at the heart of character and experience, WOLVES OF THE CALLA and SONG OF SUSANNAH find themselves near the top of King's body of work.<br /><br /> Although SUSANNAH is not as consistently entertaining as WOLVES, it does move the story considerably toward its conlusion, and does manage its own moments of brilliance. Also, by putting the &quot;Stephen King&quot; issue front and center toward the end, SUSANNAH promises a very interesting seventh book.<br /><br /> When the seventh and final veil of this long, seductive dance finally falls to the ground in September, when the dark tower has finally been revealed in all its glory, we'll doubtless be able to see the events that went before in a different, fuller light.<br /><br /> Until then, however, those of us Constant Readers who have fallen in love with the journey, will find ourselves wishing that there were still more steps ahead, more books to come.as a major character in the story. <br />  <br /> It was certainly a bold narrative decision on King's part, about which it's difficult to remain neutral.

He's a good writer, and has often used his facility with the English language for the powers of good, but I felt if I had to read just one more chapter that started with a sentence like &quot;Fric in a fracas.&quot; I was going to be ill.<br /><br /> Still, this is somewhat of an improvement, especially in the relatively strong set-up, and I look forward to reading Koontz's latest book THE TAKING...it's much shorter, so hopefully he's been able to iron out some of the problems in this one that mainly came from its unneeded length.	2004-07-28

This book is well worth your time for the bonus novella PURITY alone.  It's probably the best thing Clegg's ever written. An intense, extremely well written character study (almost reminiscent at times of the writing of John Irving) PURITY is a pure pleasure to read.  I'd instantly recommend it to any horror fan out there, and any fan of good writing and good storytelling.<br />The main attraction, NIGHTMARE HOUSE, is also a good tale, but it didn't leave me breathless the way PURITY did.  The second of three novels dealing with the haunted Harrow mansion (MISCHIEF and THE INFINITE fill out the trilogy) NIGHTMARE HOUSE is at times eerie and thrilling, but tends towards a softness of focus that keeps readers from being fully engaged in the characters the way they are in the laser-sharp PURITY.<br />Still NIGHTMARE HOUSE is a fine addition to Clegg's body of work, and I'm eager to read his new novel AFTERLIFE later this year.	2004-07-07

Mustard	I work at one of the big chain bookstores, and literally every other customer who comes to the register nowadays has a Dan Brown book in his or her hands.  It's almost rediculous.  I think we've sold more copies of THE DA VINCI CODE this last month than Taco Bell has sold tacos.<br />So I found myself wanting to see what all the fuss was about.<br />From all of the enthusiastic customers talking about the books at the register, I knew that ANGELS &amp; DEMONS is the Robert Langdon novel that comes before DA VINCI (and since it's already in paperback, I decided to start with it).<br />So, now that I've finally read a Dan Brown book, do I know what all the fuss is about?<br />Yes and no.  ANGELS &amp; DEMONS is a fun read.  It's fast-paced, and highly cinematic in terms of plot and structure.  It touches superficially on some compelling science vs. religion themes, but it ultimately doesn't demand much emotional or intellectual involvement from the reader.  It's kind like a roller-coaster where all you have to do is sit down and strap yourself in and the ride takes care of the rest.<br />The weakness of Brown's characters was probably the most disappointing part for me.  I'm willing to suspend my disbelief quite a ways as long as I feel real human eyes when I'm doing it.  ANGELS &amp; DEMONS is light on nuance and subtlety of character and heavy on stereotypes and broad exaggerations.<br />Brown made it just about impossible for me to like his protagonist somewhere near the beginning of the book when he described Robert Langdon point blank as a smart, handsome, athletic, well-liked guy.  Whenever a writer tells you should like his character, rather than drawing you into making that conclusion on your own, you know you're in trouble.<br />But, still, despite the fact that I found most of the characters highly annoying, there was so little character work in the book, that I was able to just think of them as game pieces and enjoy the ride.<br />It doesn't make Clue any less fun, for instance, because you're not emotionally attached to Col. Mustard.<br />But I guess with a book, you tend to expect more.  That's why I feel conflicted about ANGELS &amp; DEMONS.

US	50695806	RHPQFZNV3LWCF	193109571X	37309933	Dying Days	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Nineteen autopsies	DYING DAYS is an impressive collection of short stories by a young writer from North Carolina named Eric S. Brown.  A lifelong fan of horror novels and zombie movies, Brown first began publishing his short fiction in various online and print magazines in 2001. Since that time, Brown has managed to amass a sizable body of work. In the fall of 2003, Silver Lake Publishing released this collection (available in both print and electronic formats), which represents the best of Brown's work to date.<br /><br />A connective sinew of narrative and stylistic similarities runs through the stories of DYING DAYS, making the collection read more like a short meditative novel rather than a group of independent stories.<br /><br />In DYING DAYS, Brown reveals an almost morbid fascination with the ends of things. As a storyteller, he works with the post-mortem precision of a coroner, cutting through bone and laying bare gristle to reveal the grotesque mysteries hidden in inner cavities. Each story is like a mini-autopsy: you pretty much know from the get-go that all hope has long since been abandoned, but you're still morbidly curious to piece together the reasons why. Brown's stories allow the reader the perverse thrill of experiencing the life-affirming process of discovery within the contradictory medium of death.<br /><br />Although the nineteen stories making up DYING DAYS are certainly all cut from the same cloth, Brown makes each story unique enough to keep the collection interesting. Probably most satisfying is the variety of emphases in stories with a common theme. With end-of-the-world stories such as the titular &quot;Dying Days&quot; and &quot;The Return,&quot; Brown dissects the corpse of the large, and with stories such as &quot;Preservation of the Species,&quot; which focuses on the death of identity and perception, he also trains his scalpel on the corpse of the small.<br />Eric S. Brown is a talented young writer, with hopefully much great work ahead of him.  In the stories that make up DYING DAYS, Brown reveals a focused ability to tease out a single theme, and also shows himself surprisingly capable, for a new writer, of handling the heavy machineries of plot and suspense with something like old-hat panache.  DYING DAYS is by no means a perfect work.  Some of the stories could have benefitted from more detail to character, but this is something Brown can perfect in his future stories and novels.  He obviously has the drive and desire to keep creating better fiction, and DYING DAYS stands as a testiment to how far he's already come in such a short time.ies that make up DYING DAYS, Brown reveals a focused ability to tease out a single theme, and also shows himself surprisingly capable, for a new writer, of handling the heavy machineries of plot and suspense with something like old-hat panache.

He did what I thought was the impossible: he got me interested in science.  I've been a liberal arts-type since I can remember.  The exact rules and laws of science always left me kind of cold, and so I found myself drawn to literature, poetry and music as the more complete descriptors of human experience.<br /><br />But last Fall, I couldn't sleep one night and ended up staying up until dawn watching THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE.  It was amazing and captivating.  It got me excited in a way \\"science\\" hadn't since I was a kid, fascinated with the imaginative possibilities of space travel.<br /><br />I was hooked and had to get the book.  The tv program proved to be a great distillation of the book, but if you saw the program and your interest was piqued by the magical dance of superstrings and the mind-bending extra dimensional possibilities, you'll enjoy the full feast of Greene's book even more.<br />THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE is an enormous feat.  It marries the rigor of scientific enquiry with the elegant, at times poetic, presentation of literature. Greene is such an able and down-to-earth explainer of complicated mathematical concepts that he makes even the most dyed-in-the-wool math hater think about signing up for some evening classes at the local college.	2004-05-05

Lansdale has certainly worn a comfortable groove in his storytelling saddle.  SUNSET AND SAWDUST reads very much like other novels Lansdale has published in recent years (notably The Bottoms and A Fine Dark Line-two other recent non-Hap `n' Leonard novels). The humor, the atmosphere, the plotting, and the East Texas vernacular are all quintessentially Lansdale.  If you're a returning reader, you'll find yourself right at home for another stay (much too brief though it may be) with your favorite mojo storyteller.<br /><br />What gives SUNSET AND SAWDUST some extra kick, however, is a sense that even if Lansdale has covered similar territory in the past, he's still examining it with a hungry and restless eye.  His use of a female protagonist, the redhead constable Sunset Jones, might be just the ingredient that keeps SUNSET AND SAWDUST so fresh and unpredictable.  Lansdale has always written convincing female characters, but it's fun to see him examine the whole boy-girl thing from the other side of the fence.<br /><br />The enduring Lansdale theme of people with power behaving badly towards people without it is at play once again in SUNSET AND SAWDUST. But the main character, the recently self-widowed redheaded constable who is on the lookout for a killer and also a moral center, helps muddy up that notion quite considerably.<br /><br />There's also an arsenal of well written supporting characters in SUNSET AND SAWDUST that helps keep the novel well balanced and fun to read.  A noticeable progression in some of these characters' front porch philosophizing adds to the overall adventurousness of the novel.  SUNSET AND SAWDUST doesn't just sit there. . .it reaches out into the dark and does its damndest to grab hold of something.<br /><br />And it succeeds. I've been a fan of Joe R. Lansdale's writing for almost fifteen years now, and I'm happy to say that he's just getting better at what he does.  As a writer, it's always a challenge to remain true to one's evolving self, and with SUNSET AND SAWDUST Joe has risen to that task admirably. The saddle might be well worn and comfortable, but Lansdale certainly hasn't fallen asleep at the reigns.ue to one's evolving self, and with SUNSET AND SAWDUST Joe has risen to that task admirably.

Before I read it, I expected I might admire and respect it as an important comic, but I figured the subject matter was altogether too heavy and serious to permit it to be in the least bit enjoyable.<br />Boy, was I was wrong.  MAUS is not only a an amazing use of the comic idiom-an affecting chronicle of what is surely THE most uncomical event in the 20th Century-it is also a gripping and psychologically astute portrait of a family tottering on the sizable wake of that event.<br />Art Spiegelman has managed to create something equally important and entertaining with MAUS.  If you've been scared away by the heaviness of the subject matter, don't let yourself be.  It's heavy, for sure, but it's also a great bit of storytelling.	2004-05-05

I've been a devoted fan of Richard Ford's writing since I read his incredible Frank Bascombe novels, THE SPORTSWRITER and INDEPENDENCE DAY.  Those are easily two of the best books I've ever read.<br /><br />Ford is so skilled at creating damaged yet optimistic characters and making them interact in the world around them, that is just makes you want to cry with compassion and love for all of the ways that we as humans are screwed up, and yet able to mount another dream after the went before has turned into ashes.<br /><br />WILDLIFE is pure Richard Ford, though on a smaller scale than the Bascombe novels.  In this novel, Ford writes from the perspective of a young boy growing up in rural 1950's Montana with amid his parents' troubled marriage.<br /><br />Ford is often compared to Hemingway, and the similarities are certainly visible in this novel.  Ford's simple, understated, yet emotion-packed style is maybe at its most Hemingwayesque in this novel, but it's still uniquely Ford.  The young boy finding the means around him to be a man is also similar to Hemingway's Nick Adams, but again, but, again, it never feels that Ford is just imitating Hemingway here.<br /><br />Richard Ford is his own man, and his own writer, and there's something very appealing about Ford's writing, that shines through in this novel, and makes you want to celebrate the beauty of life in all its painful twists and turns.<br />If you've never read Richard Ford before, you're missing out on a great modern American writer.	2004-04-26

Book III, the WASTELANDS, for its wildly inventive storytelling gusto, is at the top of the heap, in my view.  But WOLVES OF THE CALLA, a pretty amazing tour-de-force in its own right, isn't far behind.<br /><br />The fifth book in King's DARK TOWER series actually works more as a literal continuation of the third book, with the fourth, WIZARD AND GLASS, serving as a long romantic interlude.<br /><br />WOLVES OF THE CALLA is the book that starts to give you glimpes of light at the end of tunnel.  King makes some strong hints in this book about where he'll finally take the series that he's been working on all of his publishing life.  It promised to be a mind-bending ride that, if executed just right, might be the most profound thing he's ever written.<br /><br />Either way, WOLVES OF THE CALLA is a wonderful stop along the way.  It finds King very near the top of his game.  King writes with an inventive assurance in this novel in a way that makes you glad to be a Stephen King reader.  If the last two books of the DARK TOWER series (both due later this year) are written on the same creative cloth as this book, I'm confident it'll be a terrific ending to a terrific series.<br /><br />Stephen King fans rest assured, this is one of the good ones.	2004-04-26

I've been reading graphic novels for a little over a year now, and in terms of subtlety, nuance, and overall storytelling, FROM HELL is head and shoulders above anything else I've read.  I'm currently reading Moore's WATCHMEN, which also seems to be of equal quality.<br /><br />I've never experienced anything close to what FROM HELL delivers in the admittedly short time that I've been reading comics.  Alan Moore writes with the ear of a novelist and the eye of a portraitist.  He packs this well-researched story of the Jack the Ripper murders with a wide and observant representation of life.<br /><br />This graphic novel isn't just a retelling of the facts of the Jack the Ripper case (though it does an extraordinary job of that).  It takes it all to the next level, and examines the reasons for examining such things.<br /><br />It's not so much a suspense story (you know who the killer is right from the beginning) but rather one of internal discovery.  A fascinating work of art and work of literature that should be read by anyone who wants to see just what comics are capable of.	2004-04-26

But I found myself thoroughly enjoying Mike Mignola's HELLBOY.<br /><br />This first HELLBOY book is a little on the short side, and at times, Mignola probably gives too much attention to the mythology rather than the characters, but all in all it's a fun read.<br /><br />It's not my favorite comic I've read (definitely not in the Alan Moore category) but it's fun and well worth your time.<br /><br />The artwork is definitely top notch.  Even if the story were no good (but it is good) it would be worth getting to look at.<br /><br />Now that the movie's out (which was also very entertaining and worthy of your time) I'm sure I'll keep reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2004-04-26

It's like they're not even human.<br />It just feels like there's nothing to connect to here.  Koontz has written believable characters with good intentions in the past, but it just feels like he lost all sense of what makes a character sympathetic and likable--it has much more to do with the flaws than the perfection.<br />I'll keep reading, though, in hope that Koontz will get it right again soon.	2004-04-26

Starting with an overview of Einstein's world-shaking advances in physics, Hawking brings us to the modern cutting edge of theoretical physics with explanation of string theory, and its overarching parent, M theory.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about this book is the occasional evidence in its pages of Hawking's incredibly corny sense of humor.

After reading just a few panels, it was clear that Moore is someone concerned about the texture of language, the subtext of character, and nuance of meaning.<br />I had heard this one wasn't Moore's best effort, but I wanted to read it before I saw the Sean Connery movie based on it.  I was still highly impressed, however, and thought it was one of the best written comic I'd ever read.  But after just recently finishing Moore's mesmerizing FROM HELL, I can see that by comparison, LEAGUE is a slightly inferior work.  But that's just because FROM HELL is hands-down the most amazingly complex and well written comic novel I've ever read.<br /><br />Still, LEAGUE, a high concept literary action hero romp is a lot of fun, and if it's not quite the toure-de-force that Moore achieved with FROM HELL, it's still a thrilling story.	2004-03-29

At college, I majored in English Lit, minored in Music and Philosophy and did my best to avoid anything slightly scientific.<br /><br />But then one night last October when I couldn't sleep, I stayed up flipping channels and came across Brian Greene's Nova program THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE.  I saw it was about Physics, and almost hit the clicker, but something about the presentation made me curious to watch a little more.<br /><br />Within an hour, I was a new Physics convert.  If you interested in language, art, and the disciplines of beauty, you can't help but be mesmerized by Quantum mechanics, string theory, and all of the cutting edge theories of physical world represented in Brian Greene's program.<br /><br />The next time I was at a bookstore, I tried to pick up a copy of the book the NOVA show was based on, but they were sold out, so I scoured the Physics section and found a copy of Gary Zukav's THE DANCING WU-LI MASTERS, instead.<br /><br />Written back in the late seventies, Zukav's book is one of the first popular mainstream explications of modern theoretical physics for the lay, non-science person, like myself.  I found it fascinating, and for the most part very easy to follow.<br /><br />Zukav writes in a clear and compelling manner about the wonderful mysteries of the universe.  He covers the history of how theoretical Physics got to where it is today (or at least was in the late seventies).  He explains Einstein's major contributions to science in a few easy to follow chapters, and then goes on to skillfully explain the inexplicable conundrums of quantum theory.<br /><br />As Zukav describes probability theory, he makes a convincing case that modern Physics isn't that different from Zen Buddhism.  He shows how the steel-and-concrete building blocks that make up our universe are actually a lot more fluid and suggetable than common sense would dictate.<br /><br />This books really helps you recover any amazement and wonder you might have lost in the everyday world around you.<br /><br />Check this book out if you think you're not a science person, and if you like it, also get Brian Greene's THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE.

And Kevin isn't just satisfied with going to the local cinemaplex down at the mall.  Sure, that's part of the experience, but so is finding and tracking down the world's smallest theater, the world's only theater made completely of ice and snow, the art house theaters, the foreign theaters, IMAX theaters, theaters at the Cannes Film Festival, etc.<br /><br />Every part of the movie-going experience is lived, breathed and sometimes humorously, sometimes poignantly dissected on these pages.

For the most part, it just doesn't rise to the occasion, and ultimately comes off too effervescent and vague for its own good.<br /><br />When the novel was released last fall amid a flurry of positive press (including a glowing review in Entertainment Weekly) I was only too eager to rejoin Tim Underhill and company among the grimy, troubled streets of Milhaven, scene of the previous \\"Blue Rose\\" novels KOKO, MYSTERY, and THE THROAT (three of my alltime favorite novels) for another go-round.<br /><br />This time out, unfortunately, not that much happens.  The story involves the writer Tim Underhill's teenage nephew, Mark, and details the youth's obsessive fascination with an abandoned Millhaven house.  As the young boy digs into the mystery of what went on in that house, the hard edges of reality get blurred and you find yourself wandering, along with Mark, along the dark twisting paths of the psyche that come seeping in from the edges.<br /><br />The writing is pure Straub elegance, and as always, is a pleasure to read.  Straub also revisits many of his usual themes here (exploration of the past, plumbing the inner well of guilt). The problem is that there aren't enough external goings-on in the story to hang the mantle of ephemeral spookiness on, and you end up with a feeling of much-ado-about-nothing.<br /><br />If you're a devoted Straub fan, it's certainly worth picking up a copy of LOST BOY LOST GIRL (though you might want to wait for the paperback). Otherwise, I suggest you check out KOKO, the excellent beginning to the \\"Blue Rose\\" series.	2004-02-27

He's got me wishing away my favorite season, spring, before it's even here-all for of a lousy book. This year, summer promises to deliver, along with its usual high energy bills and Olympic-sized pools of sweat, OLYMPOS, the concluding installment of Simmons' two part sci-fi epic that began last summer with ILIUM. And, of course, I wouldn't be willing to wish away all those beautiful spring evenings lying in wait unless the first book in question had been a good one. A damn good one.<br />Well, ILIUM is a damn good book. It's also by far the best sci-fi novel I've read since Simmons so eloquently and entertainingly finished his HYPERION series seven years ago with THE RISE OF ENDYMION. And just so you know that this review aspires to some level of credible objectivity, I have to admit I haven't loved everything Simmons has ever written. In his twenty-plus years of publishing, he's made a few missteps. But when he does manage to hit the bull's-eye, as he does with Ilium, he hits it dead-on, sending a loud, reverberant thwonk through the shadowy hills of genre fandom, all across the far-reaching plains of mainstream readership.<br />Ilium shows off the best of what sci-fi is capable of achieving. Simmons again creates, as he did with his HYPERION novels, a smart, scientifically- and poetically-informed vision of the future that manages to illuminate the here and now with a breathtaking crystal lense. ILIUM dizzies the mind while it stirs the heart, inviting Stephen Hawking and William Shakespeare to share a playground.<br />It's not surprising that Dan Simmons, a former school teacher, who has often written about other writers, from Hemingway to Mark Twain, should take as the inspiration for his latest sci-fi epic from the work of one of the world's most influential literary figures: namely, Homer.<br />ILIUM is the first of a two part sci-fi re-working of Homer's ILIAD. But it's more than just a futuristic dressing-up of one of the world's oldest war stories. Simmons has more in mind than just handing Achilles a light-saber and letting Hector slow down time in order to dodge spears &aacute; la THE MATRIX (a movie which took more than a few cues from Simmons' own HYPERION novels, incidentally). ILIUM brings together some of the most modern scientific musings on the nature of reality and stirs them up with a good dose of immortal wisdom from the western literary canon.<br />Simmons' protagonist, Thomas Hockenberry, is a modern-day Homeric scholar who finds himself somehow transplanted a thousand years into the future for the purpose of observing what is ostensibly a restaging of the Trojan War by mysterious post-human entities. The clouds of dust that Hockenberry chokes on are real, as are the spears whistling next to his head, and most incredibly, so are the Gods flying overhead in their whirring chariots. Hockenberry's job is supposed to be a simple one: keep his eyes open, stay out of harm's way, and make sure things go down like the old blind Greek intended.<br />But of course Simmons is too good of a storyteller to let that happen. Before long, Hockenberry finds himself perilously embedded in one of the goddess's jealous murder plots, and in order to save his own skin, he's soon forced to attempt something drastic that would be more at home in the pages of Nietzsche rather than Homer.<br />Simmons drops just enough clues as to what's actually going on in this bizarre future world where Greek gods fly the not-so-friendly skies and post-literate humans fax themselves halfway around the world to attend the latest cocktail party in order to promise that the conclusion will make for one interesting, mind-expanding piece of science fiction. If you've read Stephen King's latest DARK TOWER novel, WOLVES OF THE CALLA, you'll see that Simmons and King, not for the first time in their careers, seem to be going in the same direction, on parallel tracks. Of course, only the future will tell. Luckily, 2004 promises King's last two DARK TOWER novels, along with Simmons' OLYMPOS. So the future, at least, is not that far away.'s last two DARK TOWER novels, along with Simmons' OLYMPOS. So the future, at least, is not that far away.	2004-02-23

But it's extremely hard to make any mind sit still for long, and maybe especially an anxious one.<br />THE RELAXATION RESPONSE is written in such a clear and no-nonsense way, and it's so easy to follow, that it's got me to do what I had come to believe was the impossible: to sit quietly for ten minutes every morning with a relatively empty mind.<br /> Herbert Benson is a Harvard cardiologist who pioneered the research into stress-related causes for diseased such as hypertension.  Always weary of having his research seen as nothing more than new age fluffery, Dr. Benson made sure to prove his results by rigidly adhering to the scientific method.<br />Dr. Benson's results show that there is a capacity inherent in all human beings to invoke  a \\"relaxation response\\" that can counter the effects of the \\"flight or flight response\\" which is at the root of many modern stress-related illnesses.<br />By learning to invoke the \\"relaxation response\\" once or twice a day for just ten minutes at a sitting, one can effectively lower high blood pressure, and gain more tranquility in their emotional life.<br />This book is easy to read, and it really works.  I read it over the summer, and was able to start meditating successfully almost instantly.  My main problem I found out was that I tended to meditate while lying down and so I would just fall asleep.  I always found the idea of sitting stiffly so counter to relaxation, that I was never able to attempt to meditate that way.  But Dr. Benson's book helped me to see that one doesn't need to meditate for long periods of time, so I found it easy enough to sit cross-legged with my eyes closed and my hands on my knees for five minutes at a stretch. (I then slowly worked it up a minute at a time to ten minutes, which is the recommended length).<br />I simply count my breaths up to four and start over again.  That way if thoughts intrude on my stillness, I know it, because I lose track of my counting, so I just start counting again.<br />Meditation is still not the easiest practice, but this book has helped me make it part of my daily activities, and for that I'm extremely grateful.  I had a doctor's appointment about a month after starting my new mediatation habitat, and for the first time in almost a decade, my blood pressure was normal.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone suffering from any effects of anxiety, or anyone who would like to make meditation a part of their daily routine.

Towards the end, she transfers the common sense suggestions she's made for listening to attending to the needs of women to the realm of the bedroom.<br />Basically what it comes down to is that to be a decent lover, a man shouldn't be wanting to learn bedroom tricks, but rather should be willing to be a friend to the all of the woman that he loves.<br />It's not the most comprehensive or perfect book, but I think there's plenty of information and ideas about what women want that any man can benefit from.	2003-10-21
US	50695806	R27JK49WU7BX9Z	0786015039	680292351	The Red Church	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Place, atmosphere, and a concern for detailed portraiture...	THE RED CHURCH is an impressive first novel by a young horror writer who's sure to make a name for himself if he continues to produce work of this caliber. North Carolina native Scott Nicholson has clearly been influenced by some of the most accomplished veterans of the genre--Stephen King and Robert McCammon most notably--and has wisely borrowed and imitated the elements that work best in his own style, and, for the most part, left behind those that don't.<br />What impressed me about THE RED CHURCH right off is the easy self-assurance of Nicholson's voice. First novels frequently cop a tone that is either excessively overbearing or else downright noncommital. Nicholson manages to hit a sweet spot somewhere right in the middle.<br />It helps Nicholson greatly that he already knows much of what's important to him as a writer--place, atmosphere, and a concern for detailed portraiture head off the list. It's clear that he goes after those things with almost every word he puts on the page.<br />Equally important to Nicholson as his many literary influences are his rural Appalachian surroundings. With a simple but impressive use of language, Nicholson makes his world lilt and dance to its own dark breezes and shadows.<br />If there's one major flaw in the otherwise vivid and skillful Red Church, it's that it doesn't end nearly as well as it begins. After he manages to create such a rich, self-sustaining fictional world peopled with mostly interesting and complex characters, it's slightly disappointing when Nicholson allows himself to get bogged down with the mechanics of tying his plot together.<br />The first two thirds of the novel read like the real living, breathing thing, and the last third feels a little too much like a flow chart. This is an understandable misstep in a first outing, however, and is easible forgivable, especially when the reader considers the reason why the ending feels a little disappointing: because of how good the writing is in the first place.<br />Scott Nicholson is a writer to keep your eyes on. He's a man with considerable talents, not the least of which is an heightened sense for the subtleties and mysteries of good old-fashioned storytelling. I look forward to picking up his new novel, The Harvest, which will be published this fall by Pinnacle Horror. It'll be great fun to see where he goes from here.ace. <br />Scott Nicholson is a writer to keep your eyes on.

It was probably my favorite book in a year full of pretty good books, so I was eager to pick up another Keillor title before long.  When LAKE WOBEGON SUMMER 1956 came out in hardcover, I snatched it up and dove in with exuberance and relish (and a little picnic table mustard and ketchup).<br /><br />LAKE WOBEGON SUMMER 1956 starts off strongly enough, setting up an interesting family of characters, and putting them through a series of interesting and keenly observed episodes of mid-twentieth century interpersonal drama. The young male protagonist portrays himself, often humorously, as something of a tortured soul: a sensitive artistic type saddled with an incurably filthy mind who, as plain bad luck would have it, was born into the midst of a thick-witted, Bible-toting household.<br /><br />Young Gary is relentlessly persecuted by his goody-goody older sister, unjustly scolded and disciplined by his humorless father, and gossiped about by his aunts.  It's only his free spirit cousin, whom he has the hots for, and his somewhat free-thinking mother that give Gary some of the room he needs to grow into the adult who'll eventually write down all of these sometimes fond, sometimes painful memories.  There's also an uncle that gives him the best gift anyone could give a boy with too many thoughts in his head: a typewriter.<br />Gary spends most of the summer of 1956, when he's not fantasizing about his cousin, or writing dirty stories on his new typewriter, covering the local baseball games for the LakeWobegon paper.<br />It's not a bad way to spend the summer when you're fourteen and just starting out.  The problem is, the way it's written, it doesn't make for that great of a novel.  One problem is that nothing really happens.  Gary almost gets involved with his cousin, goes to baseball games, spanks the monkey, learns to write lead sentences, meets the lead singer of a local musical group, and that's really about it.  LAKE WOBEGON DAYS didn't have much in the way of conflict either, but it managed to propel itself with a quiet, dreamy worldview that always left you hungry for another lick, and kept you from putting the book down unless you absolutely had to.<br />In LAKE WOBEGON SUMMER 1956, you get the feeling that that wonderful ice-cream like narrative substance was left out of the freezer a little too long and got soupy on you.  There are nice moments LW SUMMER 1956, and it's worth a look if you're a frequent visitor, but all in all, it just doesn't have the hard to define stuff to keep you interested.<br />Still, it's clear from this book that Keillor has many talents as a writer, and his humor and sense of irony remain intact throughout.

It proved well worth the time and effort.<br />I've been a big fan of Peter Straub's since I was totally captivated and transported by his novel GHOST STORY the summer I was 14. Peter Straub has made a name for himself over the years writing dense, deeply textured, and psychologically compelling horror novels that often deal with the dark conflicts that flow between the broken rocks of the past into the deceptively quiet flatlands of the present.<br /><br />Although Straub's area of expertise is undoubtedly the novel, he's no stranger to short fiction.  He's published two collections of his own shorter work, and edited a previous anthology called PETER STRAUB'S GHOSTS.<br />CONJUNCTIONS is definitely superior to GHOSTS, which had its moments--both good and not so good.  In this latest anthology, which is consistently edgy, smart, and entertaining, Straub weaves together shorter works by some of the most talented writers working today into one impressive quilt.<br />CONJUNCTIONS is admittedly something of a mixed bag.  The poetic musings of \\"serious lit\\" authors share the page with more plot-concerned stories from popular genre writers.  I think it's all for the good, though.  What you get in CONJUNCTIONS is a trick or treat pillow case stuffed with fancy rich truffles and plenty of Snickers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  It's an interesting mixture, and you're never sure what you'll bring up next.<br />Of the twenty stories, only one or two are duds (the requisite black licorice-apologies to anyone who likes it.)<br />Stand out stories include John Crowley's wonderfully John Irving-esque \\"The Girlhood of Shakespeare's Heroines,\\" Jonathan Lethem's wickedly sharp \\"The Dystopianist, Thinking of His Rival, Is Interrupted by a Knock on the Door,\\" Straub's own jazz-tinged \\"Little Red's Tango,\\" and Elizabeth Hand's amazingly good \\"The Least Trumps.\\"<br />If you like reading horror stories, if you like reading \\"modern lit,\\" and you're looking for something to blur the borders nice and good, this is the book to do it.east Trumps.\\"<br />If you like reading horror stories, if you like reading \\"modern lit,\\" and you're looking for something to blur the borders nice and good, this is the book to do it.	2003-09-27

Moore tells of the inner life and times of three young friends-two female and one male-who must find ways to deal with the often frustrating realities of living and dealing with feelings in the real world.<br />Moore creates a realistically painful, yet often humorous world that you'll want to immerse yourself in over and over again.

Dickens' first novel, THE PICKWICK PAPERS, is as long and meandering as the Amazon River.  But as with a trip up the Amazon, THE PICKWICK PAPERS will most likely leave you simultaneously weary to the bone, unprecedentedly enthused, and certain in some indefinable way that you'll always be richer for the experience.<br /><br />The non-plot involves a strung together series of misadventures and humanistic serio-comic sketches of Mr. Pickwick, an aging but still vital retiree, and the young men who form the Pickwick Club, a sort of informal gentleman's club that wonders around England, getting its members in one improbable fix after another.  Everyone should be so lucky as to have a Mr. Pickwick in their lives: an uncomplicatedly giving, decent, larger than life father figure who radiates bands of human warmth like a sun in evening clothes.  It's an obvious pleasure for the Pickwickians to orbit around their benefactor and follow him wherever his undiminished sense of adventure leads.<br /><br />THE PICKWICK PAPERS is an extremely satisfying read--in many way despite itself.  It doesn't really go anywhere, and it doesn't presume to critique the human condition in a profound manner, but the sheer looseness and easy-goingness of it all proves itself in many places unexpectedly transcendent.  Probably the best parts of the PICKWICK PAPERS are those that detail the friendship between the aging Mr. Pickwick and the his protege, Sam Weller, a young world-weary up-start who spits out pithy, telling one-liners like a roomful of Woody Allen imposters trying to prove who's the real deal.<br />Sometimes the most satisfying art is the kind that takes you by the hand and walks you down this way a little ways and over that way some, and doesn't lead on that you're going anywhere or doing much of anything important, and leaves you sort of surprised by the depth of the experience you've just had.	2003-09-20

In this bittersweet coming of age novel set in rural 1950's Texas, Lansdale manages to do just about everything right.  All of the notes he hits novel are clear and in tune and a few manage to reach deep enough to stir up some seriously deep, dark and muddy emotions.<br />Lansdale was an impressively talented writer fifteen years ago when he wrote THE DRIVE-IN, a bizarre and wildly fun novel about teenagers trapped by aliens in an all-night triple-feature, and he's only gotten better over the years.  Fans of Lansdale's earlier work will recognize some perineal elements and themes in A FINE DARK LINE.<br />As the title suggests, racial concerns feature prominently in A FINE DARK LINE.  Lansdale is also concerned here with the choices we're forced to make as humans.  Friendship and love-both spoken and unspoken-are also major elements in this highly entertaining and affecting novel.<br />If you've read Lansdale before, you know what a talented storyteller the man is, and have shouldn't hesitate picking up this novel.  It's one of his best yet.<br />If you haven't read him, but are on the lookout for an author who knows how to mix laugh-out-loud humor with just the right amount of nostalgia, poetic observationl skills, and honest, sometimes soft, sometimes steely emotion, then Lansdale's your man and A FINE DARK LINE's your poison.

Dan Simmons' WORLDS ENOUGH AND TIME didn't receive quite the fanfare it deserved when it was published late last year.  WE&amp;T, which collects five of Simmons' best recent sci-fi (or speculative) novellas, was originally put out in hardcover by a small press, in a relatively small run.  It wasn't made readily available to the readers who would have eaten it up until its large-size paperback publication earlier this year, which means it unfortunately missed its window of window time at the front of the major chain bookstores, where bestsellers get stacked like Aztec pyramids.<br /><br />It's too bad, because WE&amp;T contains some of Simmons best work. Some of the best work from a guy who has been writing consistently for over twenty years now without hardly ever compromising the intelligence, emotion, and spontaneity of his output.<br /><br />If you like Dan Simmons' work, but haven't read this one (or haven't even heard of it until you clicked on this page) don't waste any time...click on the add to your cart button, or run out to your local bookstore or library and hope they have a copy.  It's a short, but consistently good collection that'll keep reminding you over and over again what a good writer Simmons is.<br /><br />The collection includes two pieces that tie into Simmons' larger Sci-Fi opi (let's pretend I didn't use that phrase): THE HYPERION CANTOS, and the recently begun ILIUM-OLYMPOS saga.  \\"Children of the Helix,\\" probably the tightest plotted and most thrilling story included in WE&amp;T is drawn from the HYPERION universe, though, as Simmons explains in his introduction for the tale, he originally wrote it as a STAR TREK episode.  \\"The Ninth of Av,\\" an obscure and yet strangely moving look into the far-future, serves as the seed for the new Homeric saga that Simmons has just begun this summer with the excellent ILIUM and will continue next year with OLYMPOS.<br /><br />Also included is \\"Looking for Kelly Dahl,\\" a great first narrative detailing a truly bizarre relationship that reads half non-fiction of Tracy Kidder and half like Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND. The writing is this tale is probably the best in the collection and nearly the best in Simmons' career.  He hits all of the right emotional notes so that they resound like echoing memories in an empty house.  It's just beautiful.<br />Rounding out the collection are a thrilling adventure story about a team of rogue mountaineers that must climb K2 with an alien.  Definitely a journey a discovery.  Also, Simmons includes an interesting treatment for a movie that he wrote, which if made, might star Dustin Hoffman.<br />At the end of the day, WE&amp;T is a great bite-size sampler of Simmons at his best.

I found Mike George's short-but-to-the-point book helpful in diffusing and alleviating many of the mental circumstances that contribute to anxiety.<br />With short, bite size chapters illustrated with soothing water-colors, LEARN TO RELAX touches on all of the important tools needed to unweave the warp of stress and anxiety that tends to bind us in knots.  Mike George covers the principles of deep breathing, meditation, visualization techniques, and also shows how to use the formidable powers of the imagination to heal the body and mind from within.<br />This book isn't a comprehensive manual on relaxation, but it wasn't meant to be.  Rather, it's a portable, user-friendly sampler that will help you take the first steps down the path of relaxation and healing.

DALLOWAY isn't a very easy book to read, but it's ultimately well worth the time and effort you'll spend wading through its almost primordial verbiage.<br /><br />Virginia Woolf was attempting something that hadn't really been done before when she wrote this vastly internal day-in-the-life study of a sickly, changeable woman whose preeminent skills are throwing parties and being `Mrs. Dalloway.'  Woolf wasn't overly fond of how James Joyce had executed his day-in-the-life tour de force, ULYSSES, so she decided to write her own, carving out in MRS. DALLOWAY a new paradigm for writing about the inner workings of mind and heart. For the most part, Woolf succeeds admirably in her journey through this literary terra nova.<br />MRS. DALLOWAY can be confounding and at times overtiring (it'll definitely make you want to read something \\"light\\" next) but it does cause you to have a genuine and unique human experience, which is really the reason we bother reading in the first place.<br />And if this one leaves you hungry for more, make sure to read Michael Cunningham's beautifully written but considerably-easier-to-read sequel/remake, THE HOURS (after spending some well earned-time poolside with your favorite summer page-turner).	2003-06-11

DALLOWAY, is a pretty stunning piece of work in its own right.<br /><br />Filled with razor-sharp observation and devastating emotional interconnectedness, THE HOURS is a stunning odyssey through a day in the lives of three women, and by extrapolation, every woman and every human being.  It would be impossible to read this book and not find little bits and pieces of yourself strewn across its pages.<br /><br />What's really amazing is that Cunningham is able to stick so close to the themes, structure, and characterization of Woolf's novel, while managing to build, out of seemingly the same pieces, a story all his own.<br />What THE HOURS does so well is reveal to us the binding emotional ties that unite us all. It makes you see the similarities in ostensibly different lives, different dreams, and different words. Cunningham manages to create a perfectly balanced fulcrum on which a large teeter totter of metaphors is able to swing up and down in powerful arcs.	2003-06-06

I felt the story was a little too reminiscent of Koontz's earlier book, THE BAD PLACE.<br />BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is about a young man and his autistic brother who run afoul of a deranged scientist versed in the cutting-edge field of nanotechnology.  After the two brothers are injected with a serum containing microscopic robots that give them unpredictably strange new powers, they soon team up with a young woman who has also been turned into a human guinea pig by the same madman.<br />Although BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON mainly sticks to the same \\"innocents on the run from powerful evil forces\\" formula that Koontz has used many times over, he should be credited with attempting to break some new ground here.  His last couple novels, although not wholly successful, have at least been showing that he's moving in some new directions.<br />My main problem with BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON, aside from its similarities to THE BAD PLACE, is that it tends to get a little preachy.  The characters wind up a little more goody-goody than is easily palatable.<br />There are some redeeming qualities to the novel as well, however.  Koontz's trademark individualistic humor is readily on display, and despite its shortcomings, the novel manages to be more or less entertaining.  When I read a new book by Dean Koontz, I always feel like I'm catching up with an old friend, and I guess that's why I'll always keep reading them.	2003-06-06

As an insatiable reader, I've developed a great appreciation for a well told story, but since I don't have much experience with comics, I can't say I have a full grasp on the aesthetics that go along with them .  I'd like to think that I can still recognize what's good and what's not so good, though.<br /><br />KINGDOM COME is certainly good.  Actually, it's one of the best comics I've read in the last year.  Mark Waid's story concerning a generational clash between the original DC superheroes and their latterday offspring packs a surprisingly emotional and spiritual left-right punch.  KAPOW  and WAZZAMM!!!<br />Alex Ross's watercolor illustrations are beautiful works of art in their own right, but coupled with the text, they contribute to a really stunning multi-media experience.  My only complaint with the artwork was that I felt Ross relied a little too much on a certain contemplative facial expression, especially when drawing his elderly protagonist.  At times I felt like I had seen the same panel many times before.  But that's really a small nitpick in the face of the obvious care for story and attention to detail that went into this pretty amazing comic.<br />Even if you're not really a fan of Superman, Wonder Woman, and all of the rest of the tights-wearing superheroes, you should check out KINGDOM COME.  You might be surprised by its maturity and emotional resonance.	2003-06-06

I got into the Beatles in a big way when I was 14, and just recently turned thirty.  In the early days, While My Guitar Gently Weeps was my favorite song of all time and George was easily my favorite Beatle. Over the years, my appreciation for all of the Beatles, as a group and as individuals, grew enormously.  Today, Id say Paul is my favorite Beatle, if I had to pick one, with George following close behind. I have all of the music the four of them made, as a group, and as solo performers, and its been a regular part of my life now for sixteen years.<br /><br />John, Paul, George, and Ringo have had a tremendous influence on my life, musically, and otherwise, so it was quite a privilege and a revelation to be able to read their own story in their own words.  I thought I knew just about everything there was to know about the Beatles.  Id read many biographies, watched the movies, the documentaries, and the Anthology series, made a pilgrimage to Liverpool and pretty much soaked up any and all Beatles trivia I could, but I was surprised by how much I learned reading the full document of their own words.<br /><br />As someone who really likes both Paul and George, I found some of the passages in the ANTHOLOGY difficult to read.  What I really saw more clearly in the book than in the videos was the schism between Paul and George & John that developed fairly early on and certainly contributed to their breakup.<br /><br />Repeatedly George mentions the dental incident in which he and John were slipped some LSD at a party by a mod London dentist in the mid sixties.  Paul wasnt there to share the experience, and refused to try LSD for several more years, despite John and Georges insistence that it would open up his mind.<br /><br />Whether or not this was a big deal at the time, its clear from Georges reminiscences that it became one later for him.  He often speaks in the ANTHOLOGY about how he felt much closer to John from that moment on, and you can really see how early the seeds for the Paul vs. the rest of the band dynamic that later intensified into the Allen Klein/GET BACK/Phil Spector snowball were planted.<br />THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY is a must read for anyone who cares to know a little more about the lives of the four men responsible for all that wonderful music.  Its not always an easy read, but along with the arguments and disagreements, the pages also reveal plenty of laughter, great memories and touching insight.  And, as Paul sang at the end of ABBEY ROAD, all of that stuff probably balances out in the end anyway.GY about how he felt much closer to John from that moment on, and you can really see how early the seeds for the Paul vs. the rest of the band dynamic that later intensified into the Allen Klein/GET BACK/Phil Spector snowball were planted.<br />THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY is a must read for anyone who cares to know a little more about the lives of the four men responsible for all that wonderful music.

It's one of those novels that compels you to turn the pages by making you wonder just how annoying its characters can possibly get.<br />Very well written, though.<br />It's a kind of Woody Allen-style high concept premise: the bitter, flippant husband in the piece goes for a back rub from a new age mystic, and magically gets all of the cynicism rubbed out of him--all of the humor, too. Overnight, he becomes so &quot;good&quot; you can't stand him.<br />Nice use of irony. I like the line in it when the liberal, socially conscious wife is shocked to find herself saying &quot;F--- the homeless!&quot;	2003-06-04
US	50695806	R3QEAW3ZZXMA91	0156027607	74781857	Solaris	Books	4	20	25	N	N	The ocean of you	SOLARIS is a fascinating if somewhat cold science fiction novel about the bizarre interaction between a semi-sentient ocean planet and the scientists sent to study it up close.  In the novel, volumes of scholarship have been penned and schools of theory advanced about the how and the why of the mysterious entity/planet, but until the current expedition no one has really been privy to the secrets that ebb and flow in the waters of Solaris.  The scientists soon discover that the planet has the ability to reach into the darkest recesses of their subconscious and make their most vulnerable thoughts and memories reality.<br /><br />It's an intriguing premise, but unfortunately Stanislaw Lem intellectualizes his story to the point that the majority of SOLARIS doesn't even read like fiction.  For a good chunk of the novel, you feel like you're reading a philosophical tract, or at times a psychology text.  It's not uninteresting stuff, but it's not necessarily an easy or fun read, either.  The characters are pretty thin, and in spite of the author's obvious passion for his themes, there isn't much emotion in the writing.<br /><br />SOLARIS is a good book, but maybe not a great novel.  It is, however, well worth reading if you like thought-provoking science fiction and know not to expect a pot-boiling page-turner.<br /><br />As a side note, Steven Soderbergh did a fine job last year with his film version starring George Clooney.  The movie, like the book, isn't for everyone, but if you can get into it, it does offer a certain detached poetic beauty.	2003-06-04

A while back, a friend of mine and I decided to pick a Shakespeare play every couple months, read it, then get together and discuss it.<br />It worked with pretty good results for ROMEO AND JULIET, but then we ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of our next selection, JULIUS CAESAR.<br />Now that I've finally finished reading the play long after our allotted \\"couple months,\\" I have to say that the fault (the mutual disinterest that effectively brought our little Shakespeare club to a halt) doesn't lie in the play itself, but rather in my preconceptions of what the play was about.<br />I can't speak for my friend, but since I took the Cliff Notes route in high school when we were supposed to be reading about Caesar and Brutus and the rest of the treacherous Roman senate (and didn't do a very thorough job at that) I always assumed the play's action revolved around the plot to kill Caesar and culminated with his death scene.  I wasn't prepared to find Caesar dead halfway through the play, with two-plus acts remaining.  I think I just lost interest once Caesar blurted, \\"Et tu, Brute?\\" and slouched over lifeless on the cold marble.<br />But thankfully I eventually kept going, and discovered what the play is really about: the manipulation of the public that goes on after Caesar's death. The speeches in JULIUS CAESAR, given by those who would take his place, are full of the damage-control, image-making spin that happens everday on our \\"all news\\" channels.  It's an interesting play, maybe not Shakespeare's best, but one that has certainly has some modern relevance and is worth examining.<br />Now if my friend and I can just get our club back on its feet.  Maybe a comedy next time...	2003-05-27

What's best about SHOPGIRL-better even than its crisp, literate prose and its witty, smart sensibility-is that it's a great story.  It's the kind of book you just can't put down.  Martin hooks you early on with his detailed, sympathetic rendering of complex yet simple characters.  Martin's skillful attention to the subtleties of his characters' emotional journeys practically obligates you to care how they make it to the end of the day.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed Steve Martin's performances, and this is one of his best.

As with Barker's previous children's book, THE THIEF OF ALWAYS (which he wrote long before the Harry Potter craze), there's a simple purity about ABARAT that makes for a truly riveting and satisfying reading experience.<br /><br />The first in a planned quartet of self-illustrated children's books, Clive Barker's ABARAT tells the story of Candy Quackenbush, a young girl from a conservative Midwestern town who finds herself drawn through an oceanic portal into an alternative world called the Abarat.  The Abarat is actually an archipelago of twenty five islands (one for each hour of the day, and another existing outside of time).  As she travels from island to island, the precociously independent Candy makes many strange humanoid and not-so-humanoid friends and not a few horrible enemies.  Chief among her foes is Christopher Carrion, the Lord of the isle of Midnight, whose powers include the ability to make nightmares real.<br />This lavishly illustrated volumes is beautiful to look at and is also a pleasure to read.  Barker's imagination is in top fertile form.  There are no missed steps or idle meanderings as there have been in some of Barker's recent efforts.  This is a great book for all ages, and for all kinds of readers. A great celebration of the imagination.	2003-05-15

This is the first voice book I've read, but I'll probably end up reading some others.  I have a musical background, have played guitar and piano for years, but just recently decided to make an effort to improve my singing.<br />I found this book helpful in some ways, but I felt it could have been easier to understand.  The book essentially details the speech level singing method, in which the chest voice and head voice are successfully bridged.<br />As a newcomer to singing, I found some of these concepts a little difficult to understand, and felt the book never really explained things very clearly.  It reminded me a little of a instruction manual that assumes you have certain parts that have not been included.<br />Also, I felt it was a little odd that there was so much ink spent on celebrity testimonials.  If the method is really that good, it should be able to speak (or sing) for itself.<br />It's been a couple of months since I read the book and listened to the CDs, and I can say that my singing has improved considerably (that's why I'm giving the book four stars).  Although I don't feel I came away with a full understanding of everything the book was trying to teach, I feel I must have osmotically picked up some concepts that have been helpful.	2003-02-10

The author of the Bram Stoker-winning collection \\"Nightmare Chronicles\\" and last year's impressive \\"The Inifinte\\" has recently published his finest work yet: \\"The Hour Before Dark.\\"<br />Clegg has always been an intuitive, visceral storyteller, but with his latest novel, it's clear that he's fast becoming a language craftsman to be reckoned with. \\"The Hour Before Dark\\" spills over with atmosphere, character nuance, and an infectious love of language that exhibits itself in sleek prose landscapes and psychologically astute turns of phrase.<br />The story involves the Raglans, a family that grew up on Burnley Island, just off the New England coast. After the mysterious and gruesome death of their father, the three Raglan children, Nemo, Bruno, and Brooke, have reunited at their family home, in hopes of finding some answers, and to try to set their tumultuous lives in order. Something traumatic happened in the Raglans' childhood days on Burnley Island, something so dark and secret that they can't remember what it is or why it's left their adult lives unhinged.<br />The three come to suspect that the incident in question might have something to do with The Dark Game, a bizarre, hypnotic pastime taught to them by their father. In order to get some of the answers they've been seeking all of their lives, they realize they'll need to play the Dark Game one more time, regardless of the consequences.<br />\\"The Hour Before Dark\\" is a quiet but forceful novel about families and the secrets they keep from the outside world, as well as the ones they keep from themselves. Clegg chose wisely in setting the novel on an island. There's probably a small degree of inbred claustrophobia lurking in the hearts of even the healthiest families. But in the not so healthy ones, like the Raglans...well, you get the feeling that you could scream your lungs out, and no one on the outside would ever hear.<br />\\"The Hour Before Dark\\" is a well written story full of dark secrets, peopled by complex, sympathetic characters. If you read it and enjoy it, why not pass it on to someone else in your family?, sympathetic characters. If you read it and enjoy it, why not pass it on to someone else in your family?	2003-02-10

As a longtime fan and Constant Reader, I hope \\"From a Buick 8\\" doesn't turn out to be King's last stand-alone novel. Not because it isn't one of his best (though, to be honest, it isn't) but rather because it does manage, at moments, to offer glimpses of just how good a storyteller Stephen King can be. There's a familiarity of voice and narrative ease at the beginning of the novel that promises an enjoyable and even transcendent reading experience. It's a promise, unfortunately, that \\"From a Buick 8\\" has a hard time keeping.<br />Stephen King publicly prophesied before it was published that \\"From a Buick 8\\" would be seen as a retread of his earlier haunted car novel, \\"Christine.\\" It isn't, though. Although both novels feature an old, menacing gas-guzzler at the center of the action, it can be argued that neither book is actually about the car.<br />\\"From a Buick 8\\" is set in a Pennsylvania State Police barracks and tells of a bizarre secret that has been kept by the men and women of Troop D for just over twenty years. It all begins in the summer of 1979 when a vintage Buick Roadmaster is found abandoned at a gas station and towed back to the barracks. The Buick has to be towed because the engine doesn't work and, as further examination will prove, it isn't really a car at all, but some unknown thing trying very hard to look like a car.<br />Most intrigued by this baffling find is Curtis Wilcox, a rookie trooper who has more than a little healthy curiosity about the unknown. Over the years, Curt's curiosity gets warped into a dangerous, eventually lethal obsession.<br />In the present day, after Curt's untimely death, his son Ned comes to volunteer at Troop D, hoping to learn something about his father from the men and women who knew him best. Sandy Dearborn, his father's closest friend, decides it's finally time to break the silence and spill the secret the troop has been keeping for so long.<br />King tells the story of the big bad Buick in a series of flashbacks, recounted, Faulkner-style, through multiple first-person narrators. The jumping back and forth in time and point of view unfortunately only serves to dilute the novel's momentum. The best parts of the book end up as isolated bits of fluid story that never get the chance to gel into a cohesive whole.<br />Problems of pacing and plot movement notwithstanding, King does manage to touch on some interesting notions. His characters are like lemmings, drawn hypnotically to the edge of the cliff, forced, against their better judgement, to stare into the void. King has always had a talent for giving everday ojbects an ominous frame of reference. In this case, the Buick, with its menacing chrome grin, stands in for the unknowable in life. It's death or it's fate or it's the heart of the person that shares your bed.<br />\\"From a Buick 8\\" has some great parts under its hood, but none of the wiring is connected and, like the title character, it never goes anywhere. Longtime King fans should give this one a test spin, but casual readers might want to look for a ride elsewhere.recounted, Faulkner-style, through multiple first-person narrators.

Robert McCammon is back, with one of his best novels ever. \\"Speaks the Nightbird\\" is the kind of book that really deserves a grass-roots, word-of-mouth campaign. If you read &quot;Boy's Life&quot; and it meant something to you, you owe it to yourself to pick up &quot;Speaks the Nightbird.&quot;<br />The story concerns an aging legal magistrate and his young clerk who come to the small Carolina village of Fount Royal at the close of the 17th century to decide the facts in a case of reputed witchcraft.<br />Matthew Corbett, the magistrate's sharp-minded young clerk, is not sure he believes in witches, despite the accepted wisdom of the day. Corbett is a young man determined to see the world with his own set of eyes. This is good news for Rachel Howarth, the alleged witch, but not such good news for the young clerk himself. Matthew's determination to make up his own mind about the case runs him afoul of many of Fount Royal's most prominent residents. The villagers, who have come to blame recent deaths and failing crops on the accused witch, would like nothing more than a speedy, fiery solution to their troubles.<br />What Matthew wants is the truth, no matter how slippery and elusive it proves to be. A boy on the cusp of adulthood, Matthew suspects that the decisions he makes in Fount Royal will ultimately be the proof of the man he is to become. What Matthew soon discovers, however, is that the road to truth and decency is bound to be a hard and lonely one. Even the magistrate, a normally fair and level-headed man who has often served as a father figure for the boy, is so mired in the \\"facts\\" of the case that he is unable to lend Matthew a helping hand.<br />On the surface, &quot;Speaks the Nightbird&quot; is a neatly contstructed, involved mystery that will draw you in with its many beguiling twists and turns of plot. But at its heart, &quot;Nightbird&quot; is--like &quot;Boy's Life&quot; before it--really a moving coming-of-age tale. McCammon concerns himself here with the thorny interior struggles waged for the prize of personal integrity; he imbues his characters and prose with a poignant decency that is sorely missing from much of today's popular fiction.<br />&quot;Speaks the Nightbird&quot; is an elegantly written, often riveting historical drama that also operates as a clever whodunit and an intriguing character study. It's also one of McCammon's best.<br />Robert McCammon is so clearly at the top of his form in &quot;Speaks the Nightbird&quot; that it would be a shame if he never fully came out of retirement. But the decision to write or not to write is always a personal one. All that McCammon's fans can do is savor the words he's already written, and of course hope for more.ith the thorny interior struggles waged for the prize of personal integrity; he imbues his characters and prose with a poignant decency that is sorely missing from much of today's popular fiction.<br />&quot;Speaks the Nightbird&quot; is an elegantly written, often riveting historical drama that also operates as a clever whodunit and an intriguing character study.

If you've read \\"Hard Case,\\" Simmons' first foray into the hard-boiled world of crime drama, you know a little of what to expect from Kurtz and company this time out-but only a little, because Simmons has truly outdone himself with \\"Hard Freeze.\\" If \\"Hard Case\\" was a cool little jazz combo swinging away for all it was worth, its sequel is a speaker-blowing blast of rock `n' roll that's guaranteed to hit you where it counts. And hit you hard.<br />\\"Freeze\\" begins shortly after \\"Case\\" left off, with the ex-con, ex-P.I. Kurtz on the run from the Farinos, an upstate New York crime family eager to get him back behind bars-or better yet, in the ground. Kurtz must also face an adversary even more threatening than the family's cut-rate wise guys (who admittedly aren't all that wise): winter in Buffalo. It's one of the coldest in history, and even the most stoic Buffalonians are admitting it's a little cool out. If that's not enough, the city has also decided to condemn the abandoned porno shop Kurtz and his secretary have been using as a base of operations. So, when all of the elements conspire against him, what's an ex-con to do?<br />Kurtz keeps himself busy. While avoiding the Farinos and a pair of crooked cops on his tail, he soon becomes entangled in the dealings of a white-collar child molester/serial killer who might very well be hiding behind a prominent false identity. In the process of bringing the killer to justice, Kurtz must avoid being squashed like a bug between the greasy wheels of city politics and organized crime. He must also make sure not to loose his footing in a deadly dance of power he's fallen into with the shrewd, estranged daughter of the Farino family, the beautiful Angelina Farino Ferrara. Both Kurtz and Ferrara are out to use the other for their own purposes, while trying not to get used up themselves. It's all very romantic, in a cold-blooded sort of way.<br />Simmons has managed to create something intriguing and vastly entertaining in the character of Joe Kurtz. Kurtz is like a great white shark, long acclimated to the icy depths of his own solitary world: he's compelled to move forward in order to survive, and is ready to devour anything or anyone that obstructs his path. And yet, from page one, he's got the reader's sympathy. There's something about his amoral lack of guile that's kind of endearing.<br />With his second Kurtz novel, Simmons has honed his ability to write in the hard-boiled genre to a dog-bothering pitch. \\"Hard Freeze\\" is lean and mean, with nary an ounce of excess fat. Even if you're not a fan of the genre, you can't help but be carried along by the sheer force of Simmons' vigorous storytelling. He creates tension and suspense and moves his characters about with the able, foresighted dexterity of a grandmaster sitting down for a game of chess.<br />Simmons has deservedly won high accolades and praise for his writing in many styles and genres (horror, science fiction, historical fiction, travel narrative, and mainstream). Wherever his restless muse next leads him, Dan Simmons is sure to take with him an ever-growing legion of readers. The jacket copy of \\"Hard Freeze\\" promises another Joe Kurtz novel in the near future, and Simmons is reportedly also working on a massive new science fiction epic to rival his Hyperion novels.

Jesse's epic struggle to bring God to justice finally comes to an end--well sort of.  Ennis' resolution is not exactly what you might have been expecting, but it all gets tied up in the end.<br />Everyone is happy who ought to be, and everyone who ought not to be is less than happy.  The story ends with a bang of vengeance and a whimper of mercy.<br />It's a fast-paced, engrossing book, and a worthy final chapter in the Preacher saga.<br />So now that I've finished it all, what do I think of the Preacher series? For the most part, it's been entertaining and good fun to read.  It's the first graphic novel I've read, and while I'm impressed with the scope and narrative quality that can be contained in a comic, I still think this one tends to be a little simple-minded.  Ennis obviously has some father-issues he's working out in this story (both literal and metaphoric) and I think those are worthy, valid themes for a novel in any medium.<br />But somewhere towards the middle of the dramatic arc, I found myself a little less than satisfied with the level of complexity in the characters.  They begin to repeat themselves and end up feeling more like cartoons of people rather than real people. Given the context, I guess that's a silly complaint. Still, it did take away from my overall enjoyment of the story.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this series to anyone who wants to investigate the world of comic story-telling.	2002-09-04

He's somehow managed to weather a lifetime's worth of storms while keeping the flame of wonder glowing brightly in his chest. For years, I've been an admirer of Bradbury's lucid, image-pregnant prose, and this new collection--hopefully, in spite of its title, not his last--is the latest reason why.<br /><br />Those who are returning to Bradbury Country will likely recognize some familiar concerns in this latest batch of stories.  Magic and illusion abound, of course, and there are plenty of characters grown wistful for the past.  Laurel and Hardy show up for the party, as do Hemingway, Melville, and Nathaniel Hawthorne.  There's plenty of time travel, a few dark rooms filled with flickering images, a handful of wild robotic inventions, pairs of heart-sick lovers, and another trip down to Mexico.<br />But there are some new twists here as well.  Bradbury, with his inimitable style and sensibility, takes on some of the gray areas that inhabit our present imperfect.  The guilty male moral quagmires of phone sex and Internet porn provide fuel for one of the stories.  There is also a pervading sadness and loneliness to these tales that feels uniquely modern.  There are plenty of unhappy couples, unfulfilled dreams, and broken connections.  This often-gray environment makes all the more poignant the bursts of golden joy and wonder.<br />Bradbury has always held in one hand the ghostly and in the other the exuberant and when he rubs his hands together and gets down to business, the resultant explosion is felt to  the metaphoric corners of Far Rockaway.<br />Bradbury-lovers rejoice: this is fine vintage. So drink up, and drink deep.	2002-09-01

American Gods deserves, for the most part, the Bram Stoker Award for best novel it won earlier this year from the Horror Writers Association. Neil Gaiman's twilight-of-the-gods epic/Great American Novel is a long, rollicking romp that reads like part Dickensian potboiler, part picaresque road novel, and part modern-day apocalyptic fable.  Commendably, it somehow manages to be both fun and ponderous.<br />Gaiman, creator of the Sandman comic series and author of the previous novel Neverwhere, has succeeded where not many dare to venture. Reminiscent of Stephen King's classic good-vs.-evil epic The Stand, American Gods asks what might happen if all of the dead and dying gods from the word's oldest religions were to take one final bloody stand against the modern gods of the Internet, technology and international commerce. The spoils of the war? Our belief, of course. Our hearts and minds.<br />The novel's protagonist is a large, deceptively oafish man named Shadow who has recently been released from prison. No sooner does he gain his freedom than he discovers that both his wife and best friend have just been killed in a gruesome automobile accident. On his plane ride home to attend the funerals, Shadow meets a mysterious older gentleman named Wednesday. The stranger, who might very well be a modern incarnation of an Old Norse God, makes a proposition to Shadow. It's an offer that, despite its dire consequences, Shadow can't refuse.<br />Shadow is a simple man whose unending passion for his dead wife and fascination for card tricks and sleight-of-hand make him a pitiable, almost childlike character. So why, if he has all the appearance of a pawn, is he being treated like a king? For reasons unknown to himself, it soon becomes clear that Shadow will play a major role in this upcoming war of the gods. As the storm of the millennium quickly approaches, he must search inside himself for the fortitude needed to play ball with the big boys.<br />American Gods is really two or three smaller novels sewn together with the sturdy thread of an ambitious premise and some weighty themes that touch on the roots of faith, myth, and the human identity.

This time around, Jesse finds himself in a small Texas town called Salvation, where he is reunited with his long lost mother, and where he also gets to play at being sheriff. Jesse puts his pursuit of the almighty on hold and goes after a local baddy, Odin Quincannon, a truly bizarre individual who looks and acts like a demented Ross Perot.<br />Jesse nearly falls in love with a black woman and finds himself dealing with the  clan, but before the grass has a chance to grow too high under his feet, he's back on the road, chasing after God.<br />This is one of the best &quot;Preacher&quot; books I've read, if not the best.  It's focused, tight storytelling that keeps propelling you to find out what happens next.  Now I've got to go down to the bookstore and cross my fingers that they have #8 in stock.	2002-07-28

It would be an exaggeration to call Jeffrey Meyers biography a hatchet job, but not much of one. You get the sense that the author wanted to take Poes reputation down a peg or two.  He portrays the troubled writer as not much more than a hypocritical, back-stabbing, often insincere hack who had the good fortune of stumbling upon a few brilliant turns of phrase.  I dont doubt any of the factual information that Meyers provides about Poes life.  I just question the authors intent in piling high so many unflattering details.  After a while, you get to wondering why Meyers even bothered writing a three hundred page book about the man.<br />I recommend this book to fans and scholars alike for the facts it provides about Poes life, but with a warning regarding the biographers unsympathetic and often harsh tone.	2002-07-28

There's Arty, a.k.a. the Amazing Aquaboy, born with flippers for arms and a terrible case of the Napoleon complex; Elly & Iphy, the beautiful Siamese twin piano players joined at the waist (two hearts and one sex); Chick, the outwardly normal, overly-exploited telepath; and Olympia, the albino dwarf who narrates the story for the benefit of her daughter, Miranda, a \\"norm\\" fortunate enough to have been born free of the insular Binewski madness.<br />The Binewskis are societal outcasts, always on the road, so the only constant they have to take root in is one another. Since their soil bed is so incestuously self-contained, it's not long before strange things start to grow. Arty, an angry, flippered ball of spite and jealousy, soon elbows his weak-minded parents out of the picture to become the new leader of the carnival family. Before long, he calls all the shots, and has everyone quivering in his tiny, mewling shadow. A little power isn't enough for the insatiable Arty, though, and he goes on to found his own quasi-religious cult, Arturism. The legions of Arturists willingly sacrifice their limbs to surgical amputation as a means of becoming more like their leader. Dunn cleverly implies that this insanity has as much to do with the cultists' burning need to follow as it does with Arty's fierce and oily charisma as a leader.<br />The albino dwarf Olympia's unconditional love for her brother Arty is one of the most disturbing elements of the novel-especially since, as narrator, she's the character in which the reader is most closely enmeshed. In the Binewski universe, the bitter and nasty Arty not only assumes the role of god, but also becomes the object of romantic love for his younger sister. Olympia's need to love proves stronger than her need to see things clearly. The worse Arty's behavior progressively becomes, the more eager she is to excuse it. It's terribly frustrating as a reader to find yourself slowly pulled deeper and deeper into the claustrophobic heart of codependency. Olympia's narration comes to feel like a hypnotic meditation on the cruelty of attachment.<br />But what makes \\"Geek Love\\" ultimately so compelling and terrifying is the familiarity of it all. There's something a little too universal about the vacuums and the emptiness that Dunn describes in this novel. I challenge any reader not to see some objectionable aspect of their own life reflected in this book. The ugly human behavior and emotion on display in \\"Geek Love\\" are the sort we'd rather publicly disown. So why is it we all end up lining up outside the tent with our money in hand, ready to take a good, long gawk?ympia's need to love proves stronger than her need to see things clearly.

Ford's incisive, intuitive skills of observation make you feel free as an invisible molecule of oxygen, permitted access to all of humanity's most private recesses.<br />Ford paints the interior lives of a series of mostly unhappy mid-Western professionals with the unflinching eye of a truly empathetic artist.  This is not an easy read, but it is more than worth your time.<br />As Ford chronicles the various hurts and pains accumulated by lives not lived fully and the subsequent emotional dead-ends and disappointments that await most would-be escapees, one gets the sense that these stories are not so much about a multitude of sins, as about a single one.  The sin of dissatisfaction might very well be an inherent human condition, a kind of original sin.  We've all felt dissatisfaction to some degree with love, unfulfilled promise, and the way things are.  If dissatisfaction is something we all have to contend with, maybe we can alleviate it by confessing our own versions of dissatisfaction.  As Richard Ford's latest collection of stories, &quot;A Multitude of Sins,&quot; makes clear, there is nothing like confession to satisfy the soul.	2002-07-10

It's good, don't get me wrong-I can't imagine ever giving anything by Shakespeare less than five stars in one of these reviews. It's just that, compared to some of his other plays such as &quot;Hamlet,&quot; &quot;Macbeth,&quot; or even comedies like &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; and &quot;As You Like It,&quot; &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; comes across as somewhat lightweight.<br />Why is that?  I guess my main complaint with &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is that the language isn't quite up to snuff; the metaphors aren't as rich and expressive as those that liberally litter the soil of other Shakespeare plays. Shakespeare's writing is almost always beautiful, but in &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; there seems to be more of an emphasis on telling a simple story in the very simplest manner. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but in the case of Shakespeare, what you miss are the transporting turns of phrase that, when they hit you just right, fling you thrillingly heavenward.<br />I've come to feel that Shakespeare has a leg up on 21st century entertainment.  His special effects are all on the page.  They're hard-wired into the story and appeal to the soul as well as the eye.  Unfortunately, in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; there's comparably little there to feed the soul.	2002-06-23

Ive been a diehard fan of horror novels and ghost stories since I was twelve, and Im always eager to read something by a new writer.<br />Last year, I became aware of Bentley Little from some buzz on the Internet and went out and bought \\"The Town\\".  It was okay, but it left me less than overwhelmed.  Still, I kept reading a lot of good things about Little, and wanted to give him another chance.<br />A majority of amazon.com reviewers cited \\"The Ignored\\" as their favorite Little novel, so I thought that would be the perfect selection for a second-chance read.<br />Unfortunately, I was even less impressed with \\"The Ignored\\" than with \\"The Town\\".  In fact, \\"The Ignored\\" really got under my skinin the worst kind of way.  I found it excessively whiny and juvenile.  The characters were shallow and the writing just felt lazy.<br />I dont mean to be overly harsh in this review, but this book just really annoyed me.  I dont think Ive ever read a book with less sympathetic main characters.<br />Spurred by a society that refuses to notice them in any way, the Milquetoast main characters become Terrorists for the Common Man, committing random acts of violence to draw attention to the plight of the Ignored.  Particularly offensive after 9/11, the small-minded and spiteful actions of the main characters grate on even the most under-developed sense of goodness and decency.  Its just hard to care about characters that are so broadly hurtful.<br />Little clearly has some things on his mind, however, and wields some weighty existentialist themes in \\"The Ignored\\"themes of identity and isolation.  Its too bad that the impact of these themes is so greatly diminished by the dullness and meanness of the storys presentation.	2002-06-21

The illicit relationship is not a pretty one (she's well-to-do, he's not, and is not always nice disparity), but it has the sense of immediacy about it, that like life, or creativity, strikes you as both necessary and real.<br />This is the first novel I've read by Margaret Atwood, so I can't compare it to any of her other work.  What I can do is compare it to the rest of books I've ever read, and to the criteria for discerning good writing that I've developed over that period of time, and say that The Blind Assassin is an excellent, well-written, captivating novel.<br />If you're looking for something rich and thick to sink your summer reading teeth into, I recommend this one highly.	2002-06-18

Bruce describes how he hit the \\"big time\\" in high-school-pal-turned-cult-horror-film-director Sam Raimi's low budget phenomenon \\"Evil Dead\\".<br />He tells about how he came to land roles in tv's \\"Hercules\\" and \\"Xena: Warrior Princess.\\"  Bruce has been in many a bad movie along the way, but he's come through it all with his humor and sense of priority refreshingly intact.<br />This is a great book for fans of Bruce, but I also recommend it to anyone who gets a kick out of Hollywood, or just anyone who enjoys a well-told story.

As the narrator of the title story, \\"Everything's Eventual,\\" points out, if you want to say something's awesome, but you don't want to sound like every other Joe, you say it's eventual.<br />Stephen King is a much different writer today than he was when he penned the direct, but effective horror stories in the late sixties and early seventies that comprised his first collection of short fiction, \\"Night Shift\\" (1977). In the mid-eighties, he broadened his creative palette considerably with \\"Skeleton Crew,\\" and then followed it in 1993 with the overflowing grab bag, \\"Nightmares and Dreamscapes.\\"<br />\\"Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales,\\" King's fourth collection, offers a generous sampling of everything he's been up to short-story-wise over the last decade or so. Although it's not all eventual, a reassuring majority of it is.<br />Fans of King's ongoing horror-fantasy epic \\"The Dark Tower\\" will be pleased to find included \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" (originally published in Robert Silverberg's \\"Legends\\"), a short novel detailing an early episode in Roland the gunslinger's quest for the Dark Tower. \\"Eluria\\" is one of the best stories in the new collection, and shows off many of King's natural talents as a storyteller (not the least of which is his ability to make it all seem so effortless).<br />The title story is so immensely readable it feels like it must have written itself. A dark sci-fi tale about a young man with a disturbing ability and a bourgeoning conscience, \\"Everything's Eventual\\" is one of the best short stories Stephen King has ever written.<br />King gives us a bit of everything in this book. He serves up several helpings of the classic gross-out/ghost story that made him famous. \\"Autopsy Room Four,\\" \\"1408,\\" and \\"Riding the Bullet\\" (a novella that attracted some attention a few years back for being published exclusively on-line) are some of the better examples.<br />The best stuff in this new collection, however, the most eventual stuff, is actually the least frightening. The subtlety of character and narrative nuance demonstrated in stories like \\"The Man in the Black Suit,\\" \\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away,\\" and \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\" (all of which originally appeared in The New Yorker) betray a shrewd understanding of the human condition that finds itself at the heart of any great piece of writing.<br />Stephen King isn't one of the most-read writers of all time just because he knows how to make you jump.

What is it about the ghost story that makes it such an enduring, perennially popular form of entertainment? From Shakespeare to Dickens, \\"A Turn of the Screw\\" to \\"The Shining,\\" for longer than stories have been written down, audiences have wanted to see dead people. The recent box office successes of \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"The Others\\" make it clear that the ghost story is alive and quite well in the 21st century. So what is it about these tales of haunted houses and haunted people that makes them so compelling to the human psyche?<br />One might begin to suspect that deeper psychological truths lurk under all those white sheets and rattling chains. In his latest novel, \\"A Winter Haunting,\\" Dan Simmons shines some light on the very real ghosts of childhood lost and life's choices not taken. A sequel to Simmons' coming-of-age horror epic \\"Summer of Night,\\" \\"A Winter Haunting\\" catches up with the young protagonist, Dale Stewart, 41 years later, in ghostly present day Elm Haven, Illinois.<br />Dale's nasty little secret is that his life at fifty is merely a shadow of the success story it seems to be.  A popular novelist and professor of English literature at the University of Montana, Dale is also recently divorced, suffering from clinical depression, and nauseously adrift on the choppy wake of a failed romance and attempted suicide.<br />Much in need of a calming influence in his life, Dale finds himself drawn by the Eden-like memories of his childhood to the once bucolic town of Elm Haven, Illinois. Dale is dismayed to find that Elm Haven, like the rest of the world around him, has become infected by the disfiguring disease of \\"progress.\\"  Part and parcel of the rootless strip-mall/boob-job world of the 21st century, Elm Haven is, like Dale himself, only a ghost of its once innocent self.<br />Still Dale is determined to mine some answers from his past. He decides to write a novel about his childhood, hoping to draw on the familiar surroundings to evoke the spirit of his past-unfortunately, the spirit in question is more than willing to oblige. Dale begins receiving cryptic messages on his laptop computer from his long dead best friend, Duane.  Some memories, it would seem, have a life and mind all their own.  Yet, is this dialogue with his dead friend proof of a ghostly afterlife, or just the latest manifestation of a mind unhinged?<br />Simmons succeeds in keeping you guessing to the very last. If you're in the mood for a creepy, atmospheric ghost story, you'll want to check out \\"A Winter Haunting\\".  It bears many surface similarities to Stephen King's \\"Bag of Bones\\" while managing to maintain a distinct spirit all its own (much in the same way \\"Summer of Night\\" shadowed King's \\"It\\").<br />The only problem I have with \\"A Winter Haunting\\" is that it feels too much like a ghost of a novel.  There's a gray kind of claustrophobia that arises from being cooped up for too long with a single character and his thoughts.  Simmons does his best to alleviate the monotony by interjecting scenes from Dale's recent failed love affair with a precocious grad student.  Unfortunately, the inevitable demise of the affair doesn't add much color to the proceedings.  It would have been nice to have witnessed firsthand some of the childhood memories from the novel Dale is writing.  As it is, \\"Winter\\" comes off as a spooky little melody that, given the proper counterpoint, might have made for a richer, more resonating harmony.<br />Still, the book ends well, suggesting an interesting connection with the previous novel, \\"Summer of Night\\".  If you're a fan of Simmons' writing, or if you're just looking for a compelling, well-written ghost story, you'll want to pick up \\"A Winter Haunting\\".

I suppose I could click the mouse a few times and get right back to you with the real answer, the right answer. But where's the fun in that? Isn't it better to imagine than it is to know? Back when I was a kid, when only dead flies were on the web, you didn't have any choice but to imagine. So here goes...<br />After reading Joe R. Lansdale's sixth Hap `n' Leonard novel, \\"Captains Outrageous,\\" I'd guess the R. might stand for refreshingly-readable (sounds like something made by the Keebler elves).  Then again, it could just as easily stand for rip-roarin'ly-raunchy or rhapsodically-R-rated.  What I'm getting at is that reading a Joe R. Lansdale novel is like going river-rafting through the rapids or roller-skating on the roof.  You're in for a wild ride whenever you pick up a Lansdale book, so you better make sure your seatbelt is good and fastened.<br />\\"Captains Outrageous\\" is maybe the wildest-plotted yet of the six novels comprising Lansdale's East Texas series starring Hap Collins and Leonard Pine.  Hap and Leonard are two well-meaning ne'er-do-wells living in the small East Texas town of LaBorde.  Hap is white and straight, Leonard black and gay, but they're the fastest of friends-brothers without the burden of family.  And yet, for some reason, whenever they get together, trouble is never far behind.<br />This time out, Hap seems to have some good luck shine on him for once.  While leaving his job as a security guard at a chicken plant one night, the martial-arts-savvy Hap successfully interrupts a rape/murder-in-progress.  The would-be victim's father is well-to-do and insists on Hap accepting a ... reward for his chivalry.<br />With some money in the bank, eager for some time away from the chickens, Hap decides to take a vacation.  And who better to ask along than his best friend Leonard?  Hap's good luck begins to sour somewhere around the time he and Leonard get on the bad side of their budget cruise ship's buffet bouncer.  They soon find themselves stranded somewhere in Mexico with no way to get home.  Things get considerably more complicated after they're nearly murdered and then rescued by a machete-wielding fisherman and his bad news femme-fatale daughter.  Hap `n' Leonard then get themselves embroiled in the dealings of a dangerous Mexican mobster who also happens to be a staunch nudist.<br />The wildness of plot and fierceness of humor that have become hallmarks of Lansdale's writing are out in full force in Captains Outrageous.  Equally prevalent are the attention to character and richness of voice that keep Lansdale's books a few notches up from being merely entertaining (not that that's the worst of crimes).<br />Lansdale has always reminded me something of Mark Twain.  Throw in bits and pieces of an old \\"Love Boat,\\" some Hemingway &agrave; la \\"Old Man and the Sea,\\" and you have an idea of what to expect from \\"Captains Outrageous.\\"  My only complaint is that the second half of the novel isn't nearly as inventive as the first. There's a restrictive symmetry to the book's revenge plot that makes the story arc more of a parabola than an ascending staircase.  Still, \\"Captains Outrageous\\" is an immensely entertaining read. It's wildly funny, consistently well written, and deserves to earn Joe R. Lansdale new legions of fans.<br />You don't have to have read any of Lansdale's earlier Hap `n' Leonard novels to enjoy this one, but you'll definitely want to get caught up afterward.  So if you happen to like your books entertaining and well written, you'd be remiss to miss out on this rare and rewarding writer.begins to sour somewhere around the time he and Leonard get on the bad side of their budget cruise ship's buffet bouncer.

Richard Ford is simply brilliant at capturing the uncapturable.<br />He is definitely the most skilled writer I've ever read when it comes to translating onto the page just what goes on in the human mind and heart as they struggle to cope with pain, loss, disappointment, and ultimately regeneration.<br />&quot;Independence Day&quot; is an interior monologue chronicling three days in the life of Frank Bascombe, former sportswriter turned realty agent, who is attempting to make some sort of real connection with his estranged teenage son.  At the same time, Frank is struggling to be reborn from a self-imposed but seemingly inevitable cocoon of mid-life, post-divorce complacency, which he has termed &quot;the existence period&quot;.<br />Ford's perception and empathy are his greatest tools as a writer.  There are brilliantly beautiful moments of emotional honesty in this book that resonate like the searing afterimage of sunlight glimpsed on a stretch of side-of-the-road evening rail.<br />I cannot say enough good things about Richard Ford.  I am in awe of him and would like to thank him for his wonderful contributions to my reading life.  I highly recommend him to anyone who cares deeply about character and getting at what it means to be human.  Ford once wrote, &quot;If loneliness is the disease, the story is the cure.&quot;  Nothing could be more true of this wonderful book.	2002-03-05

It wasn't a bad book, and I did come away from it with a better understanding of Hinduism, but I felt it was a little too dry. It lost me occasionally in its encyclopedic style presentation of facts and terminology.<br />I know it can't be easy to encapsulate a major world religion in just over 100 pages, but I felt a little more newcomer-friendliness would have made it an easier and more satisfying read.	2002-02-22

But after flipping through and reading several interesting, candid anecdotes, I felt compelled to buy it.<br />I'm glad I did.  The title of this book may be lurid and conceivably offensive, but it's a surprisingly well-written, down-to-earth guide spelling out how to be the best lover of a woman you can be--not for your sake, but for hers.<br />This book repeatedly dispels the notion that bigger is better, unless you're talking about your range of emotional intimacy.<br />A great book for anyone looking to become a better, more satisfying--and satisfie--lover.	2002-02-22

You may as well ask \\"What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?\\" if you're after a straightforward answer.  You can tell there's an interesting story somewhere under the surface-like a tattoo lurking up the starched sleeve of a parishioner's Sunday best-but you'll have to read between the lines to find it.<br />Dean Koontz has written upward of seventy novels in his uniquely successful genre-transcending career, and \\"One Door Away From Heaven\\" is one of the better ones.  It's not one of the best (those would include \\"Strangers,\\" \\"Watchers,\\" \\"Lightning,\\" and \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart\\") but it's a good one, firmly lodged up near the top ten percent.<br />\\"One Door Away From Heaven\\" concerns itself with the murky world of bioethics, the field of modern medicine made famous by Jack Kavorkian.  In his latest thriller, Koontz imagines what might happen if a sociopath who also happened to be a doctor became a little too zealous with this brand of cutthroat Darwinism.<br />Let me start with what I didn't like.  The worst parts of this long-though never slow-moving-novel are when Koontz hauls out the soapbox and rails against the philosophy of bioethics for what seems like pages on end. His argument makes the issue appear as black and white as the latest Coen brothers film.<br />The best parts of \\"One Door Away From Heaven\\" are the more subtle strokes of humanity and quiet decency Koontz uses to draw his main characters.  Leilani Klonk, a precocious nine-year old girl unlucky enough to be both disabled and the step-daughter of the aforementioned sociopath doctor, has reason to believe that she may not see her tenth birthday.  With the help of Micky Bellsong, a young woman searching for a spiritual center, Leilani is able to take the first decisive steps out of the darkness that surrounds her.<br />\\"The world is full of broken people,\\" Koontz writes in the novel's opening; he then makes it clear that the only way to repair one's self is by helping others. Koontz consistently writes his main characters with a sincere sympathy that can't help but affect his readers. It's hard not to care about the characters you're reading when the author so clearly does.<br />But if Koontz is such a nice guy, why is he also so good at creating those nasty sociopaths?  You're sure to find one in every Dean Koontz novel, just as you're sure to encounter an adorable Labrador, and plucky, likable characters struggling to overcome the lingering effects of a bad childhood. \\"One Door Away From Heaven\\" thankfully breaks away from some of the repetitive plotting techniques that have beleaguered many of Koontz's recent novels, yet it still finds itself within the well-defined borders of Dean Koontz country.  But maybe that's not such a bad place to be-a place where senseless evil is at least given the purpose of forging and defining by contrast the very forces of good that will battle and ultimately conquer it.el's opening; he then makes it clear that the only way to repair one's self is by helping others.

I tore through it in about half the time it took me to read any of the first three books. Once I picked it up, I just couldn't put it down.<br />\\"Ancient History\\" doesn't follow the main story of Jesse, Tulip, and Cassidy, but rather makes some entertaining detours to pick up the back stories of three of the side characters who up until this point have only reared their various ugly heads in perplexing cameoes.<br />This time out, we get treated to the inner workings of the Saint of Killers, the mysterious craggy-faced gunslinger who for reasons unknown has been persuing Jesse Custer.  We also learn just what makes Arseface tick, and how Jody and T.C., Jesse's down-home good-ole'-boy relations, set their ducks in a row.<br />The illustrations for these side-stories were done by a series of hired guns (Steve Pugh, Carlos Ezquerra, and Richard Case) while Steve Dillon was working on the main storyline, but the stories are all classic Garth Ennis.  In fact, I think the tales here include some of his best writing.<br />I especially enjoyed the prologue by Ennis himself in which he details some of the origins of the Preacher story, and what first interested him in the legends of the West.<br />This is a great comic.  Definitely don't skip this one!	2002-02-22

If you've never read Richard Matheson before, get this book--you'll be glad you did.  Stephen King has often cited Matheson as one of his main influences, and this book clearly shows why.<br />Matheson tells the story of Tom Wallace, a decent everyday blue collar guy (not unlike Richard Dreyfus's character in \\"Close Encounters\\") who, after being hypnotized, is able to read the darker thoughts lying under his neighbors' smiling exteriors.  This is a horror novel that truly works because it deals with very human horrors-the darkness hides inside us all.  It is also a very entertaining novel.  The characters and dialogue feel right.<br />You can see echoes of this novel in many of much of King's writing, particularly The Shining, and later books such as Needful Things and The Green Mile.  If you like Stephen King, you should definitely give Matheson a try.	2002-01-18

You can think of &quot;Proud Americans&quot; as a tasty comic hamburger, where the main story involving Jesse, Tulip, Cassidy and the Grail is the extra thick patty, coated with plenty of bright-colored oozing special sauce, all sandwiched between two toasty back stories buns.<br />This third helping of the Ennis and Dillon's &quot;Preacher&quot; begins with a flash-back to Vietnam where we learn more about Jesse's father and his influence on Jesse's current mission.  Then we come back to the present and retrieve our good friend Cassidy from the clutches of the Grail (sort of like getting Solo back from Jabba in \\"Jedi\\").  In the third act of this graphic novel, we get a longish back story from Cassidy, about how he became a fanged-one, and how he made it to this side of the Atlantic.<br />The main thrust of &quot;Proud Americans&quot; is that we are nothing if we don't stand up for our friends, and that we should never allow ourselves to be led blindly into doing \\"the right thing\\".  This is a great series, and I highly recommend it.  I gave this one only four stars because I felt some of the second and third sections moved a little too slowly.  Still, this is great stuff, and I'm eagerly looking forward to getting book 4.	2002-01-18

Everything that you think is going to happen to the characters pretty much does. Emma's fate and that of her lapdog husband Charles are written in quickly drying cement from the first few chapters. All you can really do is sit back and watch with the sick fascination of an ambulance chaser as their unrelenting boredom, sadness, and unfulfilled dreams suck them swirling to their predestined ends.<br />And yet, this book provides much more than a good wallowing session. Madame Bovary is one of the best written novels I've ever read. Flaubert is a brilliant writer. The characters are so alive in their death-in-life dance that you can't help but sharply feel their pain and see how they might have lived their lives differently.<br />Madame Bovary is a classic of French literature, but it also speaks to our modern condition in an uncanny way. Anyone searching for meaning in their life will relate to the pains and struggles of these characters. If you've been thinking about reading this (I had it waiting on my shelf for about a decade) wait no longer. Read this remarkable novel now.	2002-01-17

I liked it up until about 2/3 of the way through.  Tolkien has a keen imagination and a talent for making the reader want to believe in his creations.  But there's also an undramatic over-reliance on exposition in his writing that needlessly bogs down the story, ultimately putting a wedge between the characters and reader (at least this one).<br />I wasn't wild about &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but still wanted to give the world of Middle Earth another try.  I thought &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was a pretty good little adventure-quest story spoiled by a not so great ending.<br />I had a similar experience with &quot;Fellowship&quot;.  For the first couple hundred pages, Tolkien had me.  &quot;Fellowship&quot; wasn't the best book I'd ever read, but I was certainly immersed in the world, and was enjoying turning the pages.<br />You'll have to excuse me for going to the Titanic for a fitting metaphor, but that's the only thing I can think of at the moment.  I felt like the book hit its iceberg at the Meeting of Elron, about 2/3 of the way through.<br />The fun-if-slow-going story comes to a screeching halt as Tolkien goes into mind-numbing hyper-exposition mode for close to 30 pages.  The story continues on after that, but falteringly--the fatal damage has already been done.  The book just gets heavier and heavier after that, until it just can't stay afloat.<br />There are some great passages and concepts in &quot;Fellowship&quot; (I especially liked the psychological insitefulness Tolkien displays in having the ring possess its possessor).  But there is a distance in the way that Tolkien writes his characters that just kept me from becoming fully engaged.	2002-01-13

Okay, I know I'm setting myself up for a lot of flack by giving &quot;The Hobbit&quot; only three stars, but I don't think these reviews are worth much unless you're willing to be perfectly honest about your opinions...even if those opinions happen to be different than those of everyone else on the planet, or in the solar system. So here goes.<br />I'm twenty-eight, and I've been a huge fan of horror and sci-fi books and movies since I was about 12.  I haven't read much in the way of fantasy fiction, however, even though it's such a closely related sibling to the two genres I love so dearly.  As a kid, I loved the Narnia books, and I recently enjoyed the Harry Potter series quite a bit.  So with the new movies based on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy coming out, I decided it was time to dig into these pillars of the fantasy genre.<br />I decided to start with &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; since I'm the kind of person who always reads forewords and afterwards.  I had heard so many people talk about it over the years, that I felt like I had already inhaled most of the characters and plot points like second hand smoke.<br />Okay, let me start with some of what I liked: I think &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is an original, often charming and fun-to-read story with some great thematic floorboards holding it all up.  I like that Bilbo Baggins has some roguish family blood in his veins causing him to crave adventure in a most unhobbit-like manner.  It is inspiring that Bilbo is unafraid to follow his own path.  His actions and his unbending courage to be himself make him a role model for anyone.  In addition to Bilbo, most of the other hobbits, dwarves, and elves that inhabit this book are also quite likable.<br />It's generally a fun quest story that appeals to the imaginations of all ages.  There's a dragon guarding some stolen treasure, and a series of fortunes and misfortunes along the way that keep the reader vested in the group's concerns.<br />But there were also a couple of major shortcomings to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; that, in my view, kept it from being a great book.  Now here's the part where my opinion will probably veer off from most anyone else's.  But like Bilbo, I feel compelled to be my own self.<br />I felt that the style of the narration was overly intrusive; it made me feel less than involved in the story most of the time.  I've read the complaints that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; reads too much like a kids' book.  I didn't feel that exactly, but rather, that the point of view was just too off-putting.  There's an omniscient narrator who sweeps in on invisible wings from time to time, taking you away from characters and events you've invested large chunks of pages following.<br />Also, despite a pretty decent set up and first half, I felt that the book's ending just wasn't very well constructed.  The writing isn't actually bad, but the dramatic momentum is often lacking.  With less than a hundred pages left to go, a huge inter-race war breaks out, taking you away from the story you've spent most of the book following.  When you finally get back to the end of the original quest, the role of hero and dragonslayer is unceremoniously taken from Bilbo by a character that we hardly know.<br />I just felt that there was way too much narrative gear-shifting throughout this book.  It felt like I was taking a ride with someone who's just learning to drive a stick.<br />I don't mean to offend anyone with this review.  I just felt it was best to be honest. I know lots of people who love this book, people whose opinions I greatly respect.  I'll just have to live with a differing opinion on this.  In my view, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a pretty good story with some major structural flaws that detract from the pleasure of reading it.<br />If you grew up with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as I did with &quot;Star Wars&quot; or the stories of Ray Bradbury, you probably have the urge at this moment to poke my eye out with a key or to do something equallyterrible.  So I'd like to extend a peace offering of some kind.  I don't think &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a bad book, and I think if I had first read it as a young kid, I might have loved it. The same way that if I hadn't seen &quot;Star Wars&quot; until I was an adult, I might have only criticized its bad acting and been blind to the bottomless ocean of magic that swells hypnotically under its surface.terrible.

This is the first book I've read by Michael Chabon, but I can already say he's one of my favorite contemporary writers.<br />&quot;Kavalier and Clay&quot; is a long, fat, engrossing and enjoyable story.  If you like John Irving, or Charles Dickens, give this one a shot.  You'll be glad you did.<br />Chabon's writing is stylistically dazzling.  His sentences are like coiled, brightly-colored image-confetti that you can just keep pulling and pulling, without ever seeming to reach an end.  The style, as with much of everything else about this novel, verges on the excessive, without ever tipping the balance. Chabon uses the strong mortor of his sense of plotting and character to sandwich together his long, image-choked sentences, and the result is a structure of truly amazing proportions.<br />If you're looking for a really great book, one that will exercise your imagination, your heart, and your mind all at once, one that manages to be as heavy as lead and light as air, this is the one.	2001-12-07

But if that's the kind of warning that draws you forward like a moth to a flame, by all means, sink your teeth in.  I first heard about \\"Preacher\\" from a blurb written by Joe R. Lansdale, one of my favorite writers.  If you like Lansdale, then \\"Preacher\\"'s right up your alley.<br />This first compilation, \\"Gone to Texas,\\" which collects the first seven comic books in the series, is a blast to read.  I just couldn't stop once I picked it up.  The story is strange, hip, and compelling, and the beautiful artwork makes it all go down like Jim Jones Cool-Aid.<br />\\"Preacher\\" stands convential religion on its ear, and is bound to be offensive to many, but actually offers a positive message of personal responsibilty and moral decency buried under all the blood, guts, and apparent blasphemy.<br />The story involves Jesse Custer, a former man of the cloth with a dark past, who, after finding his faith all-but-completey eroded, is hit by one hell of a divine inspiration.  It's not your everyday burning bush, though, or voices coming from the sky.  While preaching to a parrish in a small town in Texas, Jesse is suddenly possessed by a divine entity called Genesis, which whaps into him like a holy fireball, leaving him with the ability to speak \\"The Word\\" (sort of like the Jedi Mind trick), and hell-bent on a crusade: to find the absent-landlord in the sky, God, and hold him acountable for his wayward creations.<br />Jesse is accompanied on his quest by his ex-girlfriend, Tulip, and an ultra-cool Irish vampire named Cassidy who only tears the throats out of those who deserve it.

I've always thought of Ray Bradbury as Mr. October. Hearing the name Bradbury conjures images for me of street gutters overflowing with piles of slick autumn leaves, the air saturated with the sharp scent of woodsmoke. Bradbury means brief, shadow-strewn, priceless afternoons seamlessly spilling over into long, sweet-smelling nights. It means being a child and falling in love with reading for the first time. It means being in love with life and being amazed by all of the possibilities of the imagination. Bradury also means combating the forces that would strip these feelings of freedom from your soul. Bradbury is a force for good, a medicine for melancholy, and as such, never goes out of style.<br />Ray Bradbury's new book, From the Dust Returned: A Family Remembrance, his first novel of the 21st century, began life over fifty years ago, in the first half of the 20th century, as a short story called \\"Homecoming.\\" Originally published in the 1946 Halloween issue of The New Yorker, along with an illustration by Charles Addams, creator of The Addams Family, \\"Homecoming\\" told the story of a family of strange nocturnal creatures-possibly vampires, possibly not-who lived in a grand old gabled house somewhere in the mythical October Country of Illinois. Drawn largely from his childhood experiences with his own large, eccentric family, Bradbury's Elliotts were overrun with strange aunts and uncles, weird nieces and nephews. Some could travel the world without ever leaving the attic. Some could fly, some were as old as the oldest grain sand in the Egyptian desert. At the time, Bradbury planned on fleshing the story out, and made plans with Charles Addams to collaborate on what would become an illustrated family history of the Elliotts. The plans never came to fruition, however, and although Bradbury would periodically check in with the family over the years in his short stories, the book never came to be. Not until now, anyway.<br />With his 80th birthday approaching, Bradbury's editor insisted that he finally finish the saga of the Elliotts. So Bradbury collected all of the Elliott story he had written over the years and shaped them, along with a lot of new material, into a novel of short stories, similar in structure to his own Dandelion Wine, or its prototype, Sherwood Anderson's Winesberg, Ohio. The resulting two hundred pages of virtual prose poetry, often Shakespearean in its lucid, agile metaphors, tells the complete history of the Elliott family and how they came to be and how they almost ceased to be. The history never elaborates on what exactly the Elliotts are, though.<br />This is just as well. It's not important whether they are vampires, ghosts, werewolves, or witches.  What's important is that you believe in them. The Elliotts' greatest enemy over the years has been the modern tendency towards skepticism and disbelief. When science, philosophy, and cynicism \\"disproved\\" God, all of God's darker shadows, the vampires, ghouls, ghosts, and witches that make up the Elliott clan had no choice but to crumble right along into non-existence.<br />In From the Dust Returned, Bradbury makes a strong case for believing in things you can't see in the harsh light of the day. Whether they're ghosts, ghouls, God (however you define him/her), magic, wonder, the important thing is that you believe. These are the things that make us well again, that re-inflate us and cure us of the crumpling sicknesses that breed so fertilely in our modern minds.birthday approaching, Bradbury's editor insisted that he finally finish the saga of the Elliotts.

Clegg's latest, The Infinite, is probably his best novel to date, and is a good place to start.<br />A kind of riff on Shirley Jackson's classic The Haunting of Hill House, The Infinite tells the story of three psychically-gifted individuals invited by the leader of a psychic research foundation to spend a few days in a haunted mansion in the Hudson River Valley of New York state. The haunted mansion in question, Harrow, has figured in two of Clegg's earlier works, Mischief and Nightmare House. Although The Infinite picks up on story elements and characters common to those two books, it's not necessary to have read them first.<br />What makes The Infinite such a great read is the richness of its characterization. Clegg takes his time setting up the three principles before bringing them together. Cali Nytbird, a young woman who uses her psychic abilities to help the police catch killers, Chet Dillinger, a young man who experiences his ability more as a curse than a blessing, and Frost Crane, a strange man with unhealthy compulsions who has used his ability to achieve some degree of fame all come together at Harrow like tasty ingredients in an exotic dish.<br />Also in the mix are Jack Fleetwood, the leader of the psychic research foundation, his tempestuous sixteen-year-old daughter Miranda, and Ivy Martin, the mysterious woman funding the whole endeavor for her own personal reasons.<br />All of the characters are well developed and fun to read. Clegg does a great job putting you inside the hearts and minds of each character, making you feel his or her pangs and desires. One of the greatest pleasures of reading is getting to experience the world from a new vantage point--if you're a man, knowing what it's like to be a woman in love, or vise versa. The Infinite really succeeds in this and also happens to be quite a scary haunted house book. If you're looking for an intelligent, character-driven horror novel, Douglas Clegg is your man, and The Infinite is the book.haunted house book.

Like the world-encompassing rug in Weaveworld, Coldheart Canyon gives us a perversely grotesque mural made of painted tiles that have the ability to move, breathe, and exude life.<br /><br />Katya Lupi, a Romanian-born American silent movie star, purchases the mural while on a trip to the Romanian village where she was born and has it transferred, tile by tile, to her home in the canyons of the newly-established dreamland of Hollywood. After showing off her latest acquisition to the many A-list  movie stars who frequent her decadent parties, Lupi discovers a not-unpleasant side effect of prolonged exposure to the mural: it has the ability to keep its admirers young and beautiful. Loathe to share these possibly finite benefits with just anyone, Lupi retreats into the selective seclusion of her home in Coldheart Canyon, nick-named for the chilly reputation of its mistress, where she slowly fades from the public's memory, but continues to possess her coveted youth and beauty far past her natural term.<br />Meanwhile, in the present day, not all that much has changed in Hollywood. Youth and beauty are still more valuable than oxygen, and movie stars addicted to the drug of fame will do just about anything to get another hit. Enter Todd Pickett, a Bruce Willis-style action hero who has his biggest successes firmly behind him. Pickett is starting to show his years, and as he begins to lose out on important roles, he decides he must do something to keep himself in the game. After a botched attempt at plastic surgery, Pickett finds himself horribly scarred and in need of a place to hide out until his most valuable asset, his face, has healed. Re-enter the secluded, all but forgotten house in Coldheart Canyon.<br />Pickett buys the apparently deserted mansion and secretly moves in, only to discover that he is not alone in his new hideout. As the half-phantom Katya Lupi, still young and beautiful after all these years, makes herself known to Pickett, the ghosts of Hollywood past and present mingle (more than mingle, really) and this long ghost story of a novel gets rolling.<br />Similar in tone to Barker's earlier Hollywood novel, The Great and Secret Show, Coldheart Canyon is more adept at bringing Tinseltown's fame-hungry personalities to life, or half-life, as it were. Which makes sense since Barker has had plenty of first hand exposure in the interim, living in Hollywood for a good part of the decade separating the two books. Half dark fantasy, half ghost story, Coldheart Canyon succeeds in laying bare the hungry, needy, dark side of Hollywood. Barker does an admirable job with most of the main characters, particularly with Tammy Lauper, a dowdy, starry-eyed Todd Pickett fan-club president-cum-heroic moral compass. Tammy is probably the most likable character in a long book filled to the seams with unsavory types.<br />But unfortunately, a shortage of sympathetic characters isn't the book's only flaw. At nearly 700 pages, Coldheart Canyon is just much longer than it needs to be. The book overly relies on uninspired action sequences, which tend to undermine the heavier religious themes and metaphysical premise. The story is also encumbered with a second climax that could have easily been deleted or else quickly summed up in an epilogue. I felt there were some great ideas in this book that never made it fully to the surface. Barker plays with the idea of Hollywood as a Garden of Eden and weaves interesting themes of innocence and corruption throughout the several story lines and characters, but the finer bits of the writing tend to get lost amid the plot's sound and fury.e half-phantom Katya Lupi, still young and beautiful after all these years, makes herself known to Pickett, the ghosts of Hollywood past and present mingle (more than mingle, really) and this long ghost story of a novel gets rolling.<br />Similar in tone to Barker's earlier Hollywood novel, The Great and Secret Show, Coldheart Canyon is more adept at bringing Tinseltown's fame-hungry personalities to life, or half-life, as it were.

US	50695806	R3KRN1841Q5KD4	0375504397	237509158	Black House: A Novel	Books	5	18	20	N	N	Come on in.  You'll be glad you did.	Black House is Stephen King's best book in the past ten years, granting the exceptions of Hearts in Atlantis, which I think might be his best book ever, and The Green Mile, which probably comes in a dead heat with this one.  Black House is also easily the best Peter Straub book since 1993's The Throat.  In fact this new collaboration, a sequel of sorts to King and Straub's 1984 fantasy epic The Talisman, is nothing short of a horror fiction tour de force, the dark literary equivalent of the Beatles getting back together.<br />You don't need to have read The Talisman to enjoy this new book, however.  In fact, the tone of this new one is sufficiently darker than the first book that it feels not so much like a sequel, but rather an updated re-imagining of the life of the main character, Jack Sawyer.  If you've read any of King's Dark Tower books, or the many books that tie in with the Dark Tower cosmology (practically anything King's written in the past ten years) you'll be right at home in Black House.<br />You could actually consider Black House book four-and-a-half in the Dark Tower series.  Anyone who's been waiting patiently (or not so patiently as the case may be) for the fifth installment owes it to themselves to read Black House.  This book offers you a glimpse of how King might actually finish the Dark Tower series for once and all.  In many ways, this book feels like the volleyball equivalent of a set-up for the final smash over the net that the last installment in the Dark Tower story promises to be.<br />Aside from its Dark Tower connections, Black House also happens to be a hell of a tale on its own merits.  The story concerns the grown up child Jack Sawyer, who once traveled across an alternate version of our country known as the Territories in order to save his ailing mother in The Talisman.  Twenty years have passed since that adventure unfolded (The Talisman was released in 1984, but set in 1981) and Jack now resides in the idyllic town of French Landing, Wisconsin, where he has no conscious memory of the fantastic events that befell him as a boy.  Jack's now a prematurely retired police detective in his early thirties who has moved east from Los Angeles to try to find some peace in his life.<br />Jack is soon enlisted by his friend, the Sheriff of French Landing, to help track down a particularly brutal child murderer known as the Fisherman.  Some odd things have been happening in Jack's personal life recently. Once he unofficially joins the investigation of the case he begins to see how these strange events might have some bearing on helping him find the identity of the Fisherman.  He also realizes that the roots of these strange events might lie in the long-forgotten events of his childhood.  He discovers that in order to solve this case, he's going to have to remember what it was like to be a child, and he's going to have to be able to believe again in places and things that he hasn't believed in for a long, long, long time.<br />What makes Black House particularly satisfying is the breadth and depth of rich thematic subtext that lies just below the story's surface.  It soon becomes clear that the role of the imagination in our lives is the book's controlling metaphor.  Everything feeds into the idea of imagination as a means of transport from where we find ourselves to where long and ache to be.  As Jack remembers the first time that he ever visited the Territories, while listening to old jazz records his father was playing when he was a young child (you can't get much more Straub than this), it becomes obvious what it really means to be transported to the Territories.  It doesn't happen often, surely, and most adults have willfully forgotten how to do it.  But as Jack's new adventures in Black House make it clear, it's only by having the faith to travel that you're going to end up where you need to be.<br />Another interesting angle to the imagination subtext lies in the ever-present symbolism of borders.Everywhere you look in this book you find borders of one type or another.  From naturally occurring borders, such as the great river that French Landing lies on, the Mississippi, to the Black House itself, an eerie, headache-inducing border between worlds. There's also a reference to the \\"night's Plutonian shore,\\" Edgar Allan Poe's term for the great border between life and death.  There are also the social borders that abound between many of the characters, as well as the borders of personality that exist in our own minds There's a great passage towards the beginning of the story that describes the \\"slippage\\" that often occurs along borders.  In places where two worlds meet, there's bound to be a powerful friction.<br />All of this makes perfect sense in light of the way Black House was written: two separate imaginations coming together to travel to a common place that neither could have gone to on its own.  And there's a great heat generated by this collision of imaginations that sets the story on fire and keeps it burning brightly to the very last word on the last page.  There's no problem of the wandering aimlessness here that has plagued some of both King and Straub's recent longer works.  Black House is a long book, but it doesn't read like one.  Straub and King seem to be good for each other, strengthening one another's occasional weaknesses and compounding one another's strengths. When I first heard about this book, I was a little worried that it might not live up to having both authors' names on the front cover, but believe me, it does.  Black House manages to be truly creepy, compelling, and at times moving and profound while never outstaying its welcome.  Imagine that.Everywhere you look in this book you find borders of one type or another.

As she attempts to blend her anachronistic self into the modern world, she soon discovers she has become the hunted rather than the hunter.<br />For a good portion of the book, the chapters alternate between Miriam's bloody adventures and those of Interpol agent Paul Ward and his team of mere-mortals as they attempt to capture the femme fatale in question.<br />The book is paced very well, and manages to carve out a pleasingly original channel in the often-overtrod continent of vampire lore.<br />What impressed me most about this novel, however, was the quality of the writing.  Strieber writes with a wonderfully light, and at times witty, finesse, that is just a pleasure on the eyes.  It's a treat to read this kind of skilled prose, no matter what the genre, but especially in the horror field, where it's something of a rarety.<br />Whitley Strieber should be welcomed back to what he does best with open and grateful arms.  If you've been looking for a good, intelligent horror novel, look no further.  Strieber's your man.	2001-09-23

If you're a fan of Dario Argento, the Italian maestro of horror, or if you're just a fan of well-made, artistically-minded horror films, you should read this book (and should take a closer look at the films of Dario Argento).<br />&quot;Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds&quot; is out of print, but you can buy a used copy through Amazon.com (as I did) for a cheaper price.  But then you must prepare yourself for a whirl-wind.<br />This book discusses in intimate detail the films of the great Dario Argento.  The introduction gives us some context of who he is (ex-film critic, master of the beautiful and profane), where he came from (an Italian movie-making family and the tutelage of spaghetti-western-maker Sergio Leone), what he does (makes a particular style of thriller called a giallo and often draws on the broken imagery of dreams for his most effective material).<br />Then we're off on a film-by-film analysis of Argento's career.  We study the films he's made, the choices he's made within those films, and gain an appreciation, if we don't already have one, of why this Argento is such a unique, talented film-maker.<br />&quot;Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds&quot; often reads like the film school thesis which it is.  Words and phrases like &quot;diegetic,&quot; &quot;filmic,&quot; and the old favorite &quot;mise-en-scene&quot; abound.  But you shouldn't let that deter you, even if you aren't of the overly critical, or analytical stock.  There is a lot of fascinating stuff in this book, and you're sure to walk away from it with a bigger, more profound appreciation for the films and career of one of the greats in the horror field, Dario Argento.  And if you haven't seen all of Argento's films, or if it's been a while, reading this book is a great excuse to catch up on them.<br />What surprised me most about this book was that it was written by a woman.  I didn't realize until I turned the last page of the book and read the &quot;about the author&quot; section that Maitland McDonagh has two X chromosomes.  I guess I assumed because of the subject matter--the deliriously violent, at times arguably woman-unfriendly world of Dario Argento's deep red &quot;filmic&quot; nightmares--that a man must have written the book.  But what a great perspective is given from the eyes and mind of a woman writing intelligently about horror films.  You must go get this book.on that Maitland McDonagh has two X chromosomes.

It's too bad he passed away this year and won't be giving us anymore really good books like &quot;The Traveling Vampire Show&quot;.<br />TVS is not a perfect book.  I would agree with some parts of the negative reviews on this page.  Some of the characters, especially the villains, could have used some more fleshing out, but there's too much that's good about this novel not to give it five stars.  I like to try to read at least one good &quot;summer&quot; horror novel each year, and this one is certainly it for 2001.<br />The main characters, especially Slim and Dwight, are interesting and emotionally involving.  Best of all, Laymon really succeeds at creating an imaginative world in this novel that you just don't want to leave.<br />I remember lying in my bed for hours on end each summer morning after waking up the year Stephen King's &quot;It&quot; came out, when I was thirteen.  The book was so good, I didn't want to do anything but read all day.  I felt some of that again with this book.<br />It's true that Laymon's not as poetic as Bradbury, as consistently good as King, or as emotionally moving as McCammon, but there are elements of all of these styles mixed together in this novel.  And that makes for a pretty good concoction, in my book.	2001-08-09

It's fast and furious and fun to read. It's sort of like using a paint-shaker as a rocking chair.<br />But is it Simmons at his best? No, probably not. &quot;Hardcase&quot; doesn't possess much of the poetry and density of the Hyperion books, the beauty and wonder of &quot;Summer of Night&quot; or the rich characterization of &quot;Carrion Comfort&quot;. It's a pretty good book, one that wears all of its high-octane charms right out on its bullet-hole-strewn sleave, and I probably liked it a little more than his last one, &quot;Darwin's Blade.&quot; But I'd have to say I'm still waiting for another really great book from Dan Simmons.

There is a freedom and a vibrance to McCartney's paintings, that, like his music, can't help but draw you in and infect you with a buoyant kind of wonder.<br />These paintings tear at the boundaries of what you think can and can't be done.  They're appealing and yet completely unpredictable.  In short, they are paintings from the same imagination that came up with both &quot;I Will&quot; and &quot;Why Don't We Do It in the Road?&quot; and then had the not-so-common-sense to put them back-to-back on the same record.<br />McCartney is obviously setting the artist inside free with these bold, bright canvases.  Whether this is great art, that is really a question that each pair of eyes must answer in its own way, in its own unique language.<br />I for one am glad that McCartney has chosen to make his paintings public.  I find these colorful canvases, and the artisitic courage that propelled them into being, quite inspiring.	2001-07-12

John Irving is a brilliant writer, but &quot;The Fourth Hand&quot; is less than a brilliant book.  It's immensely readable, that's for sure--it's hard not to fly through this book, even if you're an incredibly slow reader, like I am.  But by the time you've sprinted to the end of its 313 pages--making it Irving's second shortest novel after &quot;The Water-Method Man&quot;--you're left with the twitching-phantom-limb feeling that &quot;The Fourth Hand&quot; is missing something important.<br />But what is it missing?  Most of the characters are sufficiently unique and interestingly colorful to satisfy any long-time John Irving reader.  I loved the subplot with the hand surgeon, Zajac, his son, and his housekeeper.  The writing, as usual, is top-notch.  (I must say, however, I was a little disappointed with the first sentence.  Usually Irving knocks you right off your feet with his first sentences.  This one barely made me shuffle my feet.)<br />What &quot;The Fourth Hand&quot; lacks that Irving's best novels nearly drown you in is a sense of emotional immensity.  It doesn't help matters that this is such a short book.  I think Irving is at his best in the form of the sprawling novel, where his themes and characters have ample time and space to weave themselves together on the loom of your imagination.<br />&quot;The Fourth Hand&quot; suffers from excessive lightness.  It might be thought of as the 158-Pound Novel.  There's a heaviness--a pleasant heaviness--to books like &quot;The World According to Garp,&quot; &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany,&quot; and &quot;A Widow For One Year&quot; that simply isn't here.<br />And the plot just isn't as satisfying as that of &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; or &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;.  After a solid beginning--the first sentence notwithstanding--this novel just meanders.  You are still compelled to know what happens next (Irving's main strengths as a storyteller never really flag) but you find yourself just not caring which way things turn out.<br />Part of the problem I believe is the downright bizarreness of the central love story.  The main character, Patrick Wallingford, is a sort of empty soul, who begins, with the progression of events in the story, to fill himself up.  The stuff he fills himself with, though, seems so arbitrary and weird.<br />That he falls in love with the not-necessarily-likable Mrs. Clausen, the widow of the donor of his new left hand, is a plot point that is just given to us, rather than built up to.  Mrs. Clausen isn't exactly unlikable, but she's just too emotionally obscure to create much sympathy in the reader.  The gum-smacking Brooklyn makeup-girl that Wallingford tarries with briefly is much more likable than Mrs. Clausen herself. But maybe that's just the way the hand of fate is dealt, and we don't have much of a choice who we fall in love with.<br />Either way, at the end of this novel, I felt I hadn't gotten the full Irving treatment that I had come to expect.  There are moments of greatness along the way, and any longtime Irving fan should certainly read this novel, but it's just not one of his best.ng which way things turn out.<br />Part of the problem I believe is the downright bizarreness of the central love story.

You'll stop thinking of writing as some mystical activity that can only be done in a dreamlike state.  Writing will become a commonplace activity that you can do without any undue anxiety.<br />That's what Julia Cameron wants you to realize about writing--that it can be a daily activity, like brushing your teeth, or taking a bath, somethinig that you just do.  I've spent a good portion of my life wanting to be a writer, but not writing.  When I was a kid, I wrote stories all the time, and didn't care how good they were.  Then one day I grew up and became self-conscious, and the flow of writing stopped.<br />For the last fourteen years, I've kept myself pretty busy thinking of one thing after another to do instead of writing.  I've made mix tapes, I've cleaned my room, I've gone shopping, spent time with friends, gone on walks, listened to music, and when I was feeling adventurous, even thought about writing, but I've done very little actual writing.<br />Last year, I read Julia Cameron's &quot;The Artist's Way&quot; and found it very inspiring.  As with this book, you can't read a chapter without feeling a charge of life-force.<br />I think my icy self-critic is finally starting to melt some.  I didn't want to come to the computer this morning and write this review, but I did it anyway, and it wasn't so bad.  Before reading Julia Cameron's books, I would have sat paralyzed at the keyboard, spending forty-five minutes on the first sentence.  I've now spent about ten minutes writing the whole review so far.<br />I think it's a good thing, as Julia Cameron suggests in this book, to think of writing as just another component of life.  You don't judge yourself on how well you sleep each night.  You just do it, night after night.  Some nights you sleep fitfully, tossing and turning.  But then then there are other nights when you have the most beautiful dreams.  It's the same way with writing.  There's a flow to it, like the flow of life, that you shouldn't try to control.  You should just get yourself there everyday, so you're there to experience those beautiful dreams when they come.dreams.  It's the same way with writing.

Brite's &quot;Lost Souls&quot; is a great horror novel and a great piece of writing, period.  On the surface, Brite's story of modern-day young-but-old nomadic vampires glistens with wit, smart writing, vivid imagery, taught, sexually-charged language, and interesting, appealing characters.<br />What makes &quot;Lost Souls&quot; a great book is that when you sink your teeth under its pretty surface, you find a rich vein of pulsing life ready to nourish you.  &quot;Lost Souls&quot; is a pleasure to read, certainly if you're a horror fan, but even if you're not one.<br />Poppy Z. Brite writes in this novel about disaffected youth who ache for some real connection to the world around them.  They happen to either be vampires or have friends who are.  But really, she's writing about us all.  Everyone knows the desire for a belief in magic, the hunger to feel the rich flow of life in your veins.  If you were ever a kid, you know about magic.  You might have forgotten what it means to you, or why it's important.  The more intangible it is, the more important it seems to be to remember.  There are many people in the world who have willingly forgotten.  Any one of us at times is like the characters in this book:  young-but-old because we have felt the ever-shifting tide of faith go out on us, leaving us at least temporarily high and dry.  &quot;Lost Souls&quot; captures the human thirst for life beautifully.<br />If you enjoy this novel, I highly recommend George A. Romero's brilliant late-seventies vampire film, &quot;Martin&quot;--one truly excellent horror film that deals with many of the same issues as this novel.	2001-07-09

Paul McCartney has been my favorite musician for a long time now.  His music has filled moments of my life with joy, anticipation, and wonder--al of the good things that we live for.  I've had his tunes stuck in my head as I've walked through spring fields after it's been winter for a seemingly endless time.  I've listened to his albums while going for drives on sunny mornings and felt the warm sunlight refracted through the windshield on my face.<br />Paul's music is also good for a rainy day when you can smell the wet dirt, or a foggy morning when your imagination starts to wander.  Paul's music is wonderful.  I always probably would have said that it's his sense of melody and chord structure that I really like.<br />But reading Paul's lyrics naked here, without the clothing of the music, I realize that I also really love the playfulness of the words themselves.  This is a great book if you're a Beatles fan or a McCartney fan, because it'll make you come to the songs in a new way.  You can see how inventive McCartney really is, not just musically, but also lyrically.<br />He paints with his words in much the same way that he paints with his music: in a colorful way, and when his mind is wandering, there he will go...<br />Great fun for any fan of music or poetry.  If you like this book, you should also check out McCartney's recent book of his paintings.  That one's really good, too.	2001-07-09

If you have a weak stomach, you may want to stay the hell away from this play.  Just about every disgusting thing that could happen to a human being, both mentally and physically, happens in this early Shakespeare tragedy.<br />The pages run over with various forms of vile behavior.  There's... dismemberment (just about every kind imaginable), torture, people being buried alive, betraying each other, fathers killing their own daughters and hacking off their own hands, and, most gruesomely, baking their enemies in meat pies and serving them to their next of kin on the dinner table.<br />The last scene alone is enough to make you go vegetarian or at least seriously considering eating another pot-pie ever again.  This is a fairly simple revenge tale, but the words and images Shakespeare uses to tell the tale are often breathtaking.  It's certainly not as resonant or as deeply drawn as many of his later works--Macbeth and Hamlet are two of my favorites--but there are some great moments here, even if murder, mayhem,... aren't your cup of tea.	2001-07-09

It's been about a month since I finished reading this book, and the narrator Frank Bascombe's unique voice and emotional silhouette have joined those of the friends, relatives, and acquaintences I've met who have had a profound effect on me.  It's not often that a fictional character is so sharply and honestly drawn that his/her perceptions stay with me like that.<br />As with the Beatles' Nowhere Man, I think there's a bit of Frank Bascombe in all of us.  Frank is the part of us that has been damaged by the disappointments of life, and yet has managed to repair those damages to the best of our abilities and live on in spite of them.<br />Frank is a decent guy.  He has a hard time making close friends, and maybe believes you can't really have close friends as an adult.  He's doing the best he knows how, though.  He's a sportswriter, rather than a novelist (which is what he should really be) because sportswriting doesn't demand much of him.<br />His goal is to live purely inside himself like the athletes he writes about.  This means refraining from the dreaminess he is so prone to, the wandering outside the lines of his self.  It hurts Frank to wander too far from his literal surroundings.  Dreaming for Frank is like eating a bowl of ice cream laced with small chunks of broken glass.  It's deliciously painful.<br />Frank is very upfront with himself and with most of the people who wander into his life.  He has learned by experience that he must be this way if he is to avoid pain.  Still, there is something about Frank that makes me sad.  Something that I feel he is hiding too well from himself.  He has talked himself into believing that he is okay living the shell of a life he has constructed.<br />Frank is both heroic and pitiable.  He is honest and yet largely controlled by his fears.  He is frustratingly human.<br />Richard Ford is an amazingly perceptive writer.  He draws this character with the sharpness of a cold, stropped razor.  The cuts are so deep and clean, you don't even feel any pain until you touch the wound.  Truly amazing.  I'm eagerly looking forward to reading the sequel, &quot;Independence Day&quot; later this summer.an, you don't even feel any pain until you touch the wound.  Truly amazing.

Normally, I'm a VERY slow reader, but I really flew through this one.<br />Reading Douglas Clegg reminds me of playing the electric guitar in the evening in the garage while I was in high school.  His writing is raw and full of emotion and yearning.  It's alive in your hands--you can feel the book hum and vibrate as it leads you through colorful fields under its own sinewy rhythm.<br />I've read everything that Clegg has out in print (I found out about him last summer here at amazon.com) and I think &quot;Naomi&quot; is one of his best, up there with &quot;You Come When I Call You&quot; and &quot;The Halloween Man&quot;.  A must for any fan of Clegg's other work.  And if you like horror and haven't read Clegg, you should really give this one a chance.  Just remember to keep it down after eleven.	2001-06-21

When I saw that his new book dealt with agoraphobia, which I suffered terribly at the time, and had an evil doctor as the antagonist, I decided to skip this one.  I was already phobic of medicine and doctors and didn't want to make things worse.  This made &quot;False Memory&quot; the first Koontz released in over twelve years that I didn't read instantly.  I bought it, but just kept it on my shelf.<br />This year, I'm doing much better with the agoraphobia, and decided to test my boundaries by reading the book I was afraid to read before.  Dr. Ahriman is not a very likable character, and he's maybe too over-the-top for my tastes, but he didn't spoil the book for me.<br />I must say that I had a really good time reading &quot;False Memory&quot;.  It's far from the best book I've ever read, but it made me want to keep reading Dean Koontz.  Yeah, his plots are similar, his humor is sometimes way too corny, but somehow, all of the criticisms I can think of just make his writing endearing to me.  He's like the friend you know that tells the bad jokes, and if he wasn't around, you'd find yourself missing them.<br />&quot;False Memory&quot; departs from Koontz's formula in some ways.  It's quite a bit longer and the main characters aren't really on the run from anyone (at least not for most of the book).  He also uses amazon.com customer reviews as a small plot point, kind of neat.<br />&quot;FM&quot; is definitely a Dean Koontz book, though.  You can tell.  There's a very cute dog, a heaping helping of bad jokes, main characters who are just decent people, and the whole odd mix somehow works.  It's a lot of fun, and now that I'm back on the Koontz express, I'm going to read &quot;From the Corner of His Eye&quot; and then be ready for his collection of poetry &quot;The Paper Doorway &quot; this October.for his collection of poetry &quot;The Paper Doorway &quot; this October.	2001-06-20

Somebody said it was the best new horror novel they had read in years.  Then when I started working at a bookstore in town, one of my new friends there told me it was the scariest book he had ever read.<br />All of this quite intrigued me.  So I bought the book and read it over a period of about six months.  It's not a quick read, or at least it wasn't for me.  I had to have other, more normal, sane books going on at the same time.  &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is over seven hundred pages long and it's loaded with literary detour signs, unespected landmines (some duds, some live), and good old &quot;holding the book upside down in a mirror so you can read the words printed that way&quot; fun.<br />&quot;House of Leaves&quot; is a contortionist's daydream, and a conservative reader's nightmare.  I fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum and found myself admiring the new unhallowed ground Danielewski was breaking, but at other times longing for a more conventional, satisfying structure.<br />This whole thing is very postmodern.  The house is aware of itself as a house, and the book is aware of itself as a book.  There is a story of a family moving into a house, trying to sort out its interpersonal demons, and finding that the insides of things (lives, minds, houses) can often be darker, scarier, stranger, and more convoluted than they would appear from the outsides.<br />That alone would have made a great book, told with inventive language and a compelling psychological subtext.<br />But that's just the beginning, the backstory really.  &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is a story inside a story inside a story, etc.  In fact, it puts the dizzying structure of Mary Shelly's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; to shame.<br />In &quot;House of Leaves,&quot; there's a young guy named Johnny Truant who's acting as literary editor, presenting the compelling and disturbing scribblings and ramblings on an old man named Zampano.  Zampano's papers, which are presented posthumously, recount, at times blow-for-blow, a documentary film called &quot;The Navidson Record&quot; of a family moving into a house which proves to be larger on the inside than it is on the outside.<br />There is also another editor above Johnny, who makes comments on top of Johnny's comments.  Johnny finds himself wondering if the old man didn't just make up the whole story about the young family moving into the house, because Johnny is unable to find any corroborating scrap of proof that the film exists.<br />Of course, add into the mix that Johnny is a self-admitted fibber and story teller extroidinaire.  He tells us how much fun he has making up completely bogus stories for the benefit of strangers her meets in bars.<br />Knowing this, the reader has to start to wonder if the old man, Zampano, even exists, or if he's just an invention of Johnny's.  And if you follow that line of thinking too far, you might even start to wonder if the heavy black book you're holding exists.<br />This is the haunted house that's in the film that the old man made up and wrote about as if it were as real as he was, but who was really just a figment of the narrator's fertile imagination, the narrator that doesn't really exist, except on paper and in the reader's mind and imagination...so maybe none of it exists...or all of it does.  Maybe the house has turned on its porch lights somewhere deep, deep inside of you, down all those twisting tunnels and swirling, dark echoing caves.<br />Maybe there's a sign out front.  &quot;For Sale By Owner.&quot;  And under that, in small print, in French, upside down and backwards, &quot;Buyer Beware.&quot;d man named Zampano.

If for no other reason than because I was almost sure, two years ago, that there wouldn't ever be such a thing as a new Stephen King novel.  I remember seeing Stephen King and his wife Tabitha interviewed on tv the fall after his near-fatal accident, and his spirits were so low, it really didn't look like he would ever be writing again.  The gloomy feel of that interview, coupled with the Bartelby-&quot;I prefer not to&quot; theme running through the end of &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; made me worry that that might be his last full length novel.<br />Which made me sad, because I've been one of King's Constant Readers since my twelfth birthday, when I finished &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;.  I've been with him through the good years and the bad.  The occasional rambling blahs and the cherished moments of pure transcendent bliss, like at the end of &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; from &quot;Heart in Atlantis,&quot; where I simultaneously cried my eyes out and felt a surging thankfulness for being alive and being in the world, and having that book in my hands at that moment.  A perfect moment.<br />For that moment, and many moments like it over the years, I consider Stephen King a good friend.  I didn't like the idea of not hearing the voice of my friend ever again.<br />Especially when his last book, the collection &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; contained some of the best writing he'd ever done.  It left me starving for more great Stephen King.  Any Stephen King, really.<br />So I'm extremely happy to still be hearing his voice, to be reading his words.  It makes the world a better place to be in.<br />But I'll have to say that &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; isn't nearly as good as the brilliant &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot;  It's not bad--I'd rank it somewhere around the middle of his works.  In my opinion, it's much better than &quot;Insomnia&quot; and most of the post-&quot;It&quot; pre-&quot;Green Mile&quot; stuff.  There are some great characters here, some moving moments, and some places where I really felt a bit of that old familiar surge of wonder.<br />However, at 700+ pages, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is much longer than it needs to be, and it's bogged down with some clunky sub-plots and some routine-ish characters.  I will say, though, that despite its excess length, there is some enjoyable momentum as the story reaches its climax.<br />There are some great flashes of light here, as well.  Enough to catch you off guard, and make you glad you came out to play.  But they're just not sustained enough or consistent enough to engage you the way that King's best books do--&quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; &quot;It,&quot; &quot;The Shining,&quot; and &quot;The Stand,&quot; to name a few.f.

I was curious to see what the book was like.<br />Before I was more than a couple of pages into &quot;Asylum,&quot; I had already been grabbed by the magnetic pull of McGrath's darkly elegant narrative style.  He's quite talented at setting a gloomy mood, the kind that, if you're a fan of Poe or Lovecraft, you just can't get enough of.<br />The gloom that hangs over the opening pages just builds and builds as you progress through this book.  There's no escape, no asylum from the psychological claustrophobia of the characters' dark minds and ruined hearts.  The psychiatrist who narrates the story of Stella and Edgar's destructive love affair gone horribly wrong proves to be much less distanced from all this obsessive madness than he would like to think.  I came away from the book feeling that the narrator, in his calm, balanced way of trying to proclaim his sense of reason is probably the most unbalanced of all the unbalanced characters in this book.<br />This book is very well written and quite perceptive.  If it weren't also so damned depressing, I would have given it five stars.  Still, I would recommend it to readers who like their fiction dark, brooding and psychologically compelling.	2001-03-22

Like sneaking little pieces of candy between meals.<br />I read the first book last summer and really had a good time with it.  Then I read the second in the fall and was surprised that I liked it even better.  The third starts off pretty slow, and I thought the story had hit its zenith in number two, but the end of this one really picks up, rising to equal heights of joyous storytelling .  Rowling give us more of the back-story of Harry's parents in this one, and it just makes you hungry for more.  I'm looking forward to tackling the large fourth volume sometime soon so I can be ready for the fifth whenever it comes out.	2001-02-22

I've been an avid fan of the horror genre since I was eleven years old....<br />I'll have to say that I was not overly impressed with this one.  The quality of the writing itself is decent enough for the most part, and there is even the occasional poetic flash of something brilliant hiding in the tall grass of the story's pages.  The characters just fell flat for me, though.  I didn't feel like I was really that involved in the lives of any of the protagonists.  I didn't really like them all that much, either.  I felt like Little hadn't given me enough meat to sink my teeth into.  I didn't feel I could relate to them.  But despite the failings of this book, it was still sort of fun to read, and for that reason, I'm going to give Bentley Little another chance.  I'll probably try The Ignored.  I've heard that's is supposed to be one of his best.  We'll see.  I'll let you know what I think.	2001-02-19

I'm a fan of Ridley Scott's movies (Alien and Blade Runner are two of my all-time favorites) and I thought both Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore did a more than competent job.  It wasn't a bad movie, but I left the theater feeling that something was missing.  I think I would have liked it much better if I didn't have the book to compare it to.<br />If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, in book and/or movie form, you owe it to yourself to read Thomas Harris' extremely well-written and compelling sequel, Hannibal.  I had heard luke-warm things about the book when it was released two years ago, so I initially held off reading it.  Then with the approach of the movie's release, I thought I'd give it a try.<br />  I was more than pleasantly surprised at the quality and elegance of the writing and the overall smoothness and fluidity of the story-telling.  This is very literate writing.  Not the kind you often find in mass-market paperbacks these days.  In Stephen King's review of the book, he said that anything that helps blur the lines between literature and popular fiction is a welcome thing.  I would have to agree.  Harris' characters are vivid and deeply drawn.  They come alive on the page.  His metaphors are rich and provocative.  Almost Shakespearean at moments.<br />And yet Hannibal reads like the entertaining thriller that it is, at turns action-packed and at others almost comically gruesome.  The ending of the book may be difficult for some readers to stomach.  Either you don't like what Harris does with Hannibal and Clarice, as the makers of the movie did not (they changed the ending) or you go with it as a bold stroke of story-telling genius.  Either way, this fine book is well worth your time.  Highly recommended.	2001-02-19
US	50695806	R1QKBZU01VQQ26	0553214543	833414308	Women in Love	Books	5	77	79	N	N	Emotionally Intense	I think Women in Love must be just about the most emotionally intense book I've ever read.  D.H. Lawrence conjures his four main characters in what feels like the heat of a closed-room kiln.  The writing is beautiful and amazingly perceptive, but is at times stultifyingly over-analytical.<br />Yet, despite the book's combined length, density and decided lack of plot, Women in Love is surprisingly readable.  What makes this book so good is the honesty with which Lawrence imbues his two title characters, Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen, and their two chosen lovers, Birkin and Gerald.  It can be frustrating to read page after page of the mental thrashings of an individual mind's search for truth and authenticity in life and in love, but it can also be a kind of revelation.<br />  These characters think differently about the world around them than I do, and we each think differently about the world than you who are reading this do.  And yet we are all basically the same on a certain transcendent level.  We are all human and we all long for an authentic connection with the world around us.  We are different and we are the same.  That's why living in this world isn't always easy, and that's why it's always worthwhile.  This book beautifully and even entertainingly captures those basic struggles for human connection and if for that reason alone, it's well worth reading.  Highly recommended.	2001-01-11
US	50695806	R1QTWCJVAZ0H5C	0380973693	239505648	Darwin's Blade	Books	3	2	6	N	N	Entertaining, but nowhere near his best	I hate to write a less-than-five-star review for any book by Dan Simmons, because he is such an excellent, perceptive, versatile writer, but I'm going to have to do just that right now.<br />Darwin's Blade ranks down with Fires of Eden as among my least favorite of Simmons' efforts.  It's not a bad book, it's just a bad Simmons book, and there is a huge difference.  Darwin's Blade is entertaining and pretty fun to read.  If the name Dan Simmons hadn't been on the cover, I don't think I wouldn't have been disappointed at all.  It's just that it pales in the rather substantial shadow of his other great books.<br />Darwin's Blade reads like an episodic, slightly-smarter-than-average buddy cop movie with a fairly predictable love story to top it off.  As another reviewer commented, it's hard to tell how much of this is a parody, or if it's supposed to be a parody at all.  At moments it feels like it is, but at others, it reads straight.<br />All I can say is that I cried when I read the section towards the end of Simmons' The Fall of Endyimon where Endymion learns to free-cast to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.  That was one of the most beautiful, moving pieces of writing I had read in a long time.	2001-01-11

Even if you haven't read the first four &quot;With God&quot; books, this one is more than worth your time, I promise.  It's basic message is a very simple but profound one, and one that may be difficult for many people to easily agree with.  The idea is that we are all God, that everything in existence is a facet of God, and that we are not actually separate from each other or from &quot;God,&quot; but that are rather under the illusion that we are in order to have the relative experience of ourselves.<br />There can't be light if there is no dark.  If an artist drew a beautiful soul-filling, awe-inspiring drawing in white ink, you couldn't see it if it were on white paper.  That's why we need darkness in order to fully experience ourselves.<br />In this book, Neale Donald Walsch does a very good, concrete job of laying out the 10 illusions that he believes have caused humanity the most pain and trouble throughout our history.  It all starts with the necessary, but danger illusion that we are separate from each other.  Each of the other illusion builds off the previous one.<br />I was not raised in a religious household, but I have enough religious experiences of passionate living to believe in God.  Even though I am not religious, I feel I came to these books with the skepticism of one that might feel these writings are blasphemous.  But I'll have to say, that even though Walsch has a tendency to get too cute in his wording, his basic concepts are very sound, and that while I don't always believe in his style of presenting his ideas, I think the ideas themselve are very sound, and very ispiring.<br />It's hard not to agree that you should trust yourself and find your truth in yourself.	2000-12-10
US	50695806	R3MSHRPVNO7I5L	0892967048	727646325	The Bottoms	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Outstanding	I've been reading Joe Lansdale for just over ten years now, and I think this is just about the best book he's ever written.  I picked up &quot;The Drive In&quot; when I was about sixteen, and I've been hooked by his terrific writing and his great senses of humor and story ever since.<br />If you've never read anything by Joe Lansdale, you're missing out on a truly unique, authentic American writer.  It's true you probably need a strong stomach to make it through an average Joe Lansdale novel, but I think it's also true that you need a sharp sense of humor which enjoys being tickled, a sensitive soul and a hightened appreciation for the poetic in everyday life.  Joe delivers on all of these fronts.  He's like no other author I've read.  He's a little bit like Mark Twain, he's a little bit like Stephen King, and something like Harper Lee.  But that comparison only works if you put all of those in a blender and hit puree.<br />In &quot;The Bottoms,&quot; Lansdale, who is a master of the folkilsy-gruesome character-driven story, charts some new territory.  Not geographically--this one takes place, like most of his other tales, and like his real life, in East Texas--but rather stylistically.<br />Ever since reading my first Lasndale book I've been a huge fan.  His writing is always exretemely fluid.  It just makes you feel like writing must be one of the most natural human activities, like walking or breathing or taking a long drink of water when your throat feels like sandpaper.  But in this book, Lansdale seems to have tightened the linguistic screws a few notches.  Not only is the writing fluid and fun to read, but it is of a consistently excellent quality.  Before &quot;The Bottoms&quot; I probably would have only recommended Joe Lansdale to people who have a taste for the weird.  If you've seen &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; more than once for example, I know you'd like Joe Lansdale.  He's an excellent writer, but that's the kind of taste you have to have, at least on part of your palate, to appreciate him.<br />The style and characterization in &quot;The Bottoms&quot; just blew me away.  There are four excellent books that I was reminded of while reading this:  &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; by Harper Lee, &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; by Stephen King, &quot;Huckleberry Finn,&quot; by Mark Twain and &quot;Montana 1948&quot; by Larry Watson.  If you've read and enjoyed any of those books, please do yourself a favor and read Joe Lansdale's &quot;The Bottoms.&quot;  Even if you haven't read any of those others, read this one (and then go read those also).<br />The only real complaint I had about this book was that the mystery was a little too easy to figure out.  That almost didn't matter, though, because I was having such a good time with the writing and the characters.<br />One other thing was that all of the narrator's similies are mouth-wateringly food related.  This become a little trying after a while, especially if you haven't eaten for a few hours.  I half expected to find out at the end that the young protagonist had grown up to be a chef.  I thought that would have been great.<br />An excellent read, though.  Well done, Joe!  Keep up the good work!<br />If you like the feel and style of this book, I also reccomend the music of guitarist John Hiatt, particularly his latest CD, &quot;Crossing Muddy Waters.&quot;  I got to know this CD at the same time I was reading this book, and they blended together very nicely in my imagination., at least on part of your palate, to appreciate him.<br />The style and characterization in &quot;The Bottoms&quot; just blew me away.

But if you stick with it, you're apt to find that it gets easier and the benefits become more apparent.  Shakespeare's metaphorical language forces your mind to stay nimble and alert and his rich imagery gives you no other choice than to reconnect your soul to the world around you.<br />&quot;The Tempest&quot; is a lot of fun to read and it's not as weighty or ponderous as some of Shakespeare's dramas.  It's a good choice to start with if you haven't read Shaksepeare before, or if you haven't read him since high school.  The story involves Prospero, a duke who has been banished to a deserted island, along with his young daughter, Miranda.  Propsero uses his magic to shipwreck a party of ex-compatriates who were originally responsible for his ousting.  The ensuing drama deals with issues of loyalty, treachery, forgiveness, freedom, and the mind and body dichotomy.  But the best part of it all is the vivid imagery.  In the play's best moments, the words glow on the page.	2000-11-07
US	50695806	R3UIFJ2M0ULBGV	0843947667	187446020	Mischief	Books	3	5	7	N	N	A page turner, but...	This is the fourth Douglas Clegg book I've read, and is easily my least favorite so far.  I heard about Clegg over the summer and read his &quot;Nightmare Chronicles&quot; short story collection.  I was impressed by that and went on to read &quot;You Come When I Call You&quot; and &quot;The Halloween Man,&quot; both of which I enjoyed quite a bit.<br />I've been a fan of the horror genre for quite a while now, but it's been some time since I've tried reading a new author.  I don't think Clegg's writing is as good as Straub's, King's, or McCammon's, but his books tend to be a lot of fun to read.<br />I guess I was surprised by how poorly written &quot;Mischief&quot; is.  The story's language is very sloppy.  It feels like it was written quickly and not really revised other than for technical errors.<br />The story is interesting enough, and for a while, in the beginning, there was a love story that I thought was going to become really involving and save the book from the less-than-stellar writing.  But, as in &quot;You Come When I Call You&quot;, the love story is dropped half-way through.  I think this is too bad.  Clegg is talented at getting two characters together and beginning to engage them, but he doesn't follows up.<br />Still, I don't want to be too harsh in this review.  I did enjoy the book and plowed through it pretty quick, which is something for me since I'm such a slow reader normally.  I still look forward to reading more books by Clegg.  This just isn't his best.  I'd recommend reading &quot;Nightmare Chronicles&quot; first.	2000-10-28

When I was eleven, I bought Pet Sematary at the local grocery store paperback rack.  I'd never read an adult book before, but something about the book's spooky cover made me know I had to have it.  As it turned out, what was inside the book was even better.<br />What was inside was something that stirred and awakened my imagination.  Right at the beginning of puberty (I finished that book on my twelfth birthday) I fell in love with reading.  I'm 27 now, and my relationship with reading shows no signs of breaking off.  It's been fifteen years, and I still can't get enough. Reading will always be an important part of my life.  It's such a personal, even spiritual activity.  While reading, you can get to places in yourself that you never knew existed until you read that specific ordering of words on the page.  For a second your breath is taken from you and you feel a wonderful magnetic rush of recognition as your soul leaps up to meet the words somewhere in an imagined, but very real just-created space.  That's what great writing has the power to do, and that's why there's nothing quite like it in the world.  It's like dreaming with your eyes open.<br />Stephen King's new book, On Writing, is part autobiography and part how-to manual for aspiring writers.  I think that just about anyone who truly loves to read has the lurking desire to write.  That's my feeling, anyway.  I don't know how you couldn't want to do it.  I've wanted to be a writer pretty much all of my life.  So far, a lack of confidence and an overly critical inner voice have pretty effectively kept me from doing the one thing I know I really want to do.  It's my own fault that I haven't written more than I have, but I also think that I have the power within myself to turn that around.<br />Reading Stephen King's new book, I found myself truly inspired to give writing another try.  In the autobiographical sections of the book, King recounts formative events from his often difficult childhood and early adulthood.  His family was dirt-poor and he often had to work long hours at miserable jobs to help support his single mother.  Instead of letting those aspects of life beat him down, he was able to mine them for material for his writing.  In reading this section of the book, one gets a great feeling of the redemptive power of the creative imagination.<br />The writing portion, like the autobiographical one, is not exhaustive.  King touches on a few main points that are important to him.  Mainly that you have to love to read and love to read a lot in order to be a writer.  Because it's that force of loving the thing that's going to get you to where you want to be.  If that engine of wonder and fascination is not going full-tilt, you're not going to go anywhere.  That's why you can't be ashamed of what you like.  You've got to bathe in it, day after day.  If you like mysteries, read myesteries.  If it's westerns or romances, read westerns or romances.  You can't worry about what other people are going to think about what you're reading. &quot;Oh, he's got a soft mind&quot; or  &quot;She doesn't read anything important.&quot; When you let yourself listen to those voices, which I've done for too much of my life, you cut yourself off from the intuitive center of your being.  Then you just spin around in frustrating circles, chasing your tail instead of living life the way you want to.  If you love to read Shakespeare, by all means read Shakespeare, but do it because you love it, not because you want to be impress anyone.  I'm just starting to be able to do that now.<br />Anyway, I thought this was a truly wonderful little book.  It's not perfect, it doesn't come near saying all there is to say on the subject of writing--I don't think a thousand volumes could do that--and it's at times pretty opinionated, but it does inspire and it's very honest and to the point.  If you've ever had the yearning to write but felt you lacked some essential ability, do yourself a big favor and get this book.  From one aspiring writer to another, good reading, good writing, and good luck.t you lacked some essential ability, do yourself a big favor and get this book.

I thought the first book was great, but I'd have to say this one was even more entertaining.<br />J.K. Rowling does a great job not only keeping the twists and turns of plot flying fast and furious but also making you feel that the characters are old friends you're getting the chance to catch up with.  When you join Harry, Ron, and Hermione for another year back at Hogwarts, you really feel like you're part of the gang.  This is a great book for kids, but also offers much to adult readers.  I think Harry Potter is great, not only because it has gotten so many kids truly interested in picking up a book, but also because it gives parents something they can share with their children.  I think any sharing of enthusiams is a good thing.<br />On a side note, I found it interesting that a certain similarity of plot with that of the Star Wars films is continued in this sequal.  In the first book, Young Harry, who doesn't realize that he has been born with a great purpose, leaves his uncle and aunt's hum-drum home to go on a journey and learn the ways of the magic arts.  He must battle a dark nemesis who was once a good magician, but was seduced by the dark side.  In this sequal, as in the first Star Wars sequal, one of the main characters is even frozen solid towards the end of the story.  If you enjoy Star Wars, give this series a shot; it has much the same spirit to it.	2000-10-07

In fact, I just passed the sixth anniversary of my  first full-blown panic attack.  For anyone who's had a panic disorder, you  know how frightening it is and how alone it can make you feel.  This book  gives you some hope, because it helps you to understand at least partly why  you're feeling the things you're feeling.  You're not crazy, and you're not  going to die (even if you're sure you are--I was pretty sure I was going to  die almost everday for the last six years, but I'm still here).<br />This book  is written for women, but most of the physchological insights apply just as  well to men.  I'm a 27 year old man and I found this book extremely  helpful.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who has experienced  debilitating anxiety and panic firsthand.  I also think it would be a good  read for anyone who just wants to understand human behavior and negative  thought tendacies better.  In helping us to understand and clearly see the  unrealistic expectations that we all carry around in our heads, De Rosis  points the way to living an easier, simpler, happier life.	2000-09-18

I think I'll pick up  &quot;The Tempest&quot; next.<br />The poetry in this volume is beautiful,  equisite and full of passion.  What makes Shakespeare worth reading is the  way he lets the world into his lines.  His metaphors appeal deliciously to  the senses, like a beam of sunlight through a high window in the afternoon,  or the smell of a new cut lawn in the spring.  Shakespeare's writing is  immortal, not because a conspiracy of teachers got together and decided it  should be, but because it is full of life, and nothing that is full of life  can really ever die.<br />If you're not used to reading Elizabthean English or  are put off by the thought of Shakespeare, this is a good place to start.  This edition helpfully &quot;translates&quot; each sonnet into modern  English on a facing page along with definitions for the more troubling  words.  Even with the help, I still don't think Shakespeare is all that  easy to read.  But anything you do in this world that makes you feel more  passionate about life is a pretty good thing.  If you give Shakespeare some  of your time, he's bound to pay you back with plenty of interest.	2000-09-17

Part town  history, part family remembrance, Lake Wobegon is imbued with a warm, sly  humor that picks at the silliness and the earnestness that are woven so  tightly together in small town American life.<br />Although I found this book  immensely entertaining, and times quite moving, I should mention it took me  about three months to read.  Keillor's immensely appealing voice,  story-telling ability and sense of humor kept me at all times very  interested, but there isn't really a plot to speak of.  I had to keep other  books going on the side to give me my plot fix.  This was the only aspect  of the book that I thought might put off readers otherwise disposed to read  the book and enjoy it.  But don't let this deter you.  Believe me, the book  is definitely worth whatever time you take to read it.	2000-09-16

I've been fascinated by them, and irresistably, magnetically attracted to them  all of my life.  I wanted to understnad a little more about this powerful  pull.  Women are beautiful, mystical, and wonderfully different.  There's  that quality in a woman's voice that just doesn't exist in a man's that can  make all of the world feel like it's suddenly become light as a feather.  There's always been that bewitching paradox about the sexes.  We're all  human, but our perspectives are inherantly different.<br />In this slim but  nourishing volume, Johnson lucidly examines the Greek myth of Psyche and  Cupid.  Using Jungian pysychology, he shows that the trials a girl must  undertake to become a woman are no different today than they were in the  ancient world.  Johnson tells us why myth is so important to us as humans.  It's one of the truest, clearest records of ourselves.  When a myth is  passed on from one generation of storytellers to another, it is refined and  slowly given its truest shape.  The parts that glow are given more emphasis  and the parts that don't are left along the way.<br />As the author stresses,  this book is not really about women, but rather about the 'feminine' that  exists in both women and to a lesser degree men.  In learning to understand  the psychological imperatives of the female, not only will a man be more  adept in his relationships with women, but he will also better understand  his own complex nature.	2000-08-15

With the addition of the Blue Rose trilogy  (&quot;Koko,&quot; &quot;Mystery,&quot; and &quot;The Throat&quot;), which  is also fantastic, Straub has quite a few titles in my short list of  all-time favorite books.<br />It's his writing that gets me every time.  It's  always deeply moving, evocative, and poetic.  Reading Peter Straub is like  experiencing a richly-woven dream from which you just don't want to wake  up.<br />I enjoyed Straub's last collection of short fiction, &quot;Houses  Without Doors,&quot; but felt it was less satisifying than the novels he  had been putting out at the time (&quot;Koko&quot;, &quot;Mystery&quot;).  The stories in that collection had an experimental quality that worked at  times, but sometimes left me feeling they were too bizarre for their own  good.<br />There is a similar pervisity in the stories in this new collection,  but I think Straub comes closer in &quot;Magic Terror&quot; to doing what  he does so well in his novels.  &quot;The Ghost Village,&quot; one of the  stronger stories in the collection, starts with a great Straub opening line  and just builds and builds from there.  Fans of &quot;Koko&quot; will enjoy  revisiting the haunted Vietnam soldiers of that story.<br />&quot;Porkpie  Hat&quot; and &quot;Mr. Clubb and Mr. Cuff,&quot; two more strong entries,  are closer in length to novellas than short stories.  &quot;Porkpie  Hat,&quot; which happily combines Straub's enthusiasms for jazz and the  past, is a shere pleasure to read. &quot;Mr. Clubb and Mr. Cuff,&quot; a  riff on Herman Melville's &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener,&quot; borders on  the overly-bizarre, but is more than enjoyable enough to make it worth  reading.  The prose in this novella is almost downright  Dickensian.<br />&quot;Bunny is Good Bread&quot; is a harrowing psychological  etching of the childhood of a disturbed individual who will show up later  in Straub's &quot;Blue Rose&quot; trilogy.  The Cinderella-esque fable  &quot;Ashputtle&quot; is similarly disturbing.  &quot;Hunger, An  Introduction&quot; is funny, strange, and stirring all at the same time.  My least favorite story was &quot;Isn't It Romantic?,&quot; which I felt  was longer than it needed to be, and as result was too slow and  predictable.  But even when Straub isn't in top form, his language is  always a pleasure to read.  Another down-side to this kind of collection is  that if you're a big fan, you've probably already sought out at least a  couple of these stories in their original places of publication.  Of the  seven stories collected here, I had already read three.  But it was fun to  re-read them, anyway.<br />All in all, these seven tales deliver the reader on  a satisfying journey of the psyche, at turns dark and tortuous (also  torturous) and alternately achingly poetic.  Straub often lingers in the  finer spaces where beauty and wonder mix like dreamy liquids with the ether  of the human soul.  In &quot;Porkpie Hat,&quot; he writes that  &quot;[a]nyone who hears a great musician for the first time knows the  feeling that the universe has just expanded.&quot;  That same  universe-expanding quality can be found in Straub's prose.<br />If you've  never read Peter Straub before, you should probably start with &quot;Ghost  Story&quot; or the &quot;Blue Rose&quot; trilogy.  The stories in  &quot;Magic Terror&quot; tend more towards the category of &quot;acquired  tastes&quot;.  If you enjoy Straub's writing and have something of an  adventurous mind, I'd definitely recommend this book.<br />I felt that this  was something of a return to form for Straub.  While not as good or as  consistant as his best writing, I was more satisfied with &quot;Magic  Terror&quot; than I was with his last two slightly disappointing novels,  &quot;The Hellfire Club&quot; and &quot;Mr. X.&quot;  I now eagerly look  forward to Straub's new collaboration with Stephen King.agerly look  forward to Straub's new collaboration with Stephen King.	2000-08-07

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is something that I would have loved to have read as a kid, and something that I love reading  now.  I just finished this first book and look forward to reading the later  books in the series.<br />The story and characters are quirky and interesting.  I found the plot of this first book very reminiscent of one of my favorite  movies, Star Wars.  Think of Harry Potter as Luke Skywalker, raised by his  aunt and uncle, unaware of his true potential until the right circumstances  invite him to take a step into a larger world.<br />This desire to make more  of ourselves and to come in full contact with the magic that we intuitively  sense around us is universal to all human beings.  It's no wonder that this  book and these characters have become so immensely popular.  This is a book  that can be enjoyed by readers of all ages.	2000-07-11

I've also read his short story  collection, The Nightmare Chronicles, and his novel, You Come When I Call  You.  I read all three books back-to-back this summer, and just wasn't able  to put any of them down.<br />The Halloween Man is the story of Stony  Crawford, a boy on the verge of manhood who, in the autumn of his fifteenth  year, learns some troubling things about his birth, and must decide how to  move forward in the light of this knowledge.  There are many similarities  between this novel and You Come When I Call You.  They both feature main  characters on the cusp of adulthood who must battle demonic forces in a  small town (in both cases the town is ultimately wiped out Roanoke  Colony-style by the evil force in question).<br />Clegg probably does a better  job in You Come When I Call You of building a strong propelling narrative  that leaves the reader with no other choice than to keep turning pages.  The Halloween Man is still very reader-friendly, but it's a little bit  smaller and quieter of a novel (a little bit, anyway).  The focus here is  more on atmosphere and history.  Clegg brings out more of the local color  of the small seacoast New England town than he did for the desert town of  You Come When I Call You.  There's something very Lovecraftian about the  briny surroundings that doesn't bode well for the local inhabitants.<br />In  both novels, Clegg is concerned with religion and in teasing out what he  believes, and what his characters believe about the origins of Biblical  stories.  I found this very fascinating, especially in The Halloween Man,  in which Clegg does a more complete job of teasing out those beliefs.<br />If  you've read and enjoyed any of Clegg's other writing, you should certainly  pick up The Halloween Man.  If you haven't read anything by Clegg and are  thinking about it, I would either start with his short story collection,  The Nightmare Chronicles, or this novel.  You Come When I Call You is more  of a powerhouse, but The Halloween Man displays more range and more of  Clegg's facets as a writer.Call You is more  of a powerhouse, but The Halloween Man displays more range and more of  Clegg's facets as a writer.	2000-07-09

I recently read his short story collection, The Nightmare Chronicles, and was sufficiently impressed with his writing to want to seek out one of his novels.  Now that I've read one,  I think I'm going to have to go out and buy everything else he's  written.<br />  I've been a big fan of the horror genre since I read Stephen  King's Pet Sematary when I was eleven.  A list of my favorite authors would  have to include King, Peter Straub, Ray Bradbury, Robert R. McCammon, Clive  Barker, Dan Simmons, T.E.D. Klein, Dean Koontz, Joe R. Lansdale, and now  Douglas Clegg.<br />I decided to read You Come When I Call You because it had  just been published, and because I had read reviews comparing it to  Straub's Ghost Story and King's It (two of my all-time favorites).  Having  now read the book in question, I'd have to say that it's not as good as  either of those, but it's still a hell of a good read, and still worthy of  five stars.  (Another book that I was reminded of while reading it was  Stinger by Robert R. McCammon).<br />In You Come When I Call You, Clegg tells  a story of childhood friends reunited in the present by a shared experience  in their past--an experience so visceral and unrelenting that it continues  to live on in their hearts and in their tormented waking dreams.  The novel  is divided into five parts which alternate between the story of Peter,  Alison, and Charlie's last summer of childhood in the desert town of  Palmetto, California, 1980 and the fallout of that summer in the present  day.  This technique of alternating between the characters as adults and  children is probably the novel's strongest similarity to It.  It's a great  narrative device, because I found that reading about the characters' pasts  made me want to know more about their futures and vice versa.  One of  Clegg's themes in the book is how good and evil aren't opposite forces, but  rather parts of the same whole.  He seems to be saying the same about the  past and the present.<br />The novel is also similar in its structure to  Bram Stoker's Dracula.  The narrative is woven together from a bunch of  disparate sources:  journal entries, taped interviews, and third person  narration.  In the beginning, I found this a little distracting.  I felt  that I didn't know enough about the characters and had a hard time relating  to them as a result.  But once I was on page 60 or 70, I felt the various  forms of narrative had gelled together into a cohesive whole.  From that  point on, I just couldn't put the book down.<br />The novel's similarity to  Ghost Story is mainly one of plot:  there's a group of friends haunted by  an event they took part in in their youth, having to do with a beautiful  young woman who is more than she at first appears to be.  I didn't feel  that Clegg's style was very similar to Straub's.  It's more visceral and  gut-level, and probably less elegant (though I don't mean that as a  put-down).  Straub is one of my favorite stylists.  He's hard to beat.  With Clegg, I feel the beauty of his writing is more in the momentum he  develops in his story-telling, and in the ease with which he seems to do  it.<br />My only real complaint was that I felt I didn't get enough of the  charcters' childhoods.  Just when I thought they were getting really  interesting as characters, the novel switched back to the present and later  just summarily dealt with the concluding events of the summer of 1980.  I  would have particularly liked to have read more of the romance between the  teenaged Peter and Alison.<br />Still, it's a great horror novel, and I highly  recommend it.

Straub's Ghost Story is to this day one of my all time  favorite books.  Another one of my favorites is Boy's Life by Robert  McCammon (I sure hope he reconsiders retirement).  When I started to read  some reviews of Clegg's works and saw that they were drawing comparison to  McCammon as well as Straub, along with Dan Simmons and Stephen King (two of  my other perennial favorites), I knew it was time to check this guy out.  So I immediately placed an order for his new novel You Come When I Call  You.  But my anticipation got to me.  Imagining how great it would be to be  reading a new author on the par with these other greats, I decided I  couldn't wait the three or four days for the book to arrive by UPS.  So I  went downtown to my local used bookstore and bought a copy of The Nightmare  Chronicles.<br />Right off the bat, the cover made me feel I was in McCammon  country.  A paperback original short story collection with a darkish blue  graveyard in the foreground and a huge moon looming in the background.  Just like McCammon's Blue World.  Since that was the first book I read by  McCammon, I thought this was probably a good place to start with  Clegg.<br />The first story, &quot;Underworld,&quot; did remind me of  McCammon.  The next one, &quot;White Chapel,&quot; was very Dan  Simmons-esque.  It takes place in India and features a woman reporter  trying to track down a psychopath who has been transformed into a kind of  cult religious figure.  Very Jospeh Condrad, for that matter.  By the time  I was on page thirty or forty, I was already very impressed with Clegg's  writing style.  It's similar in ways to McCammon, but tends to have the  more visceral bite of Clive Barker or Joe R. Lansdale's edgier stuff.  Although his style is similar to these other authors, it is also very much  his own.  What I liked right away was the amount of small, perceptive,  telling detail with which Clegg imbues his writing.  Reading Clegg, you  very quickly get the reassuring feeling that you're in the hands of someone  who knows what he's doing.<br />Clegg is great at pulling you into his stories  by setting up a bizarre premise which leaves you hungering to find out  exactly what is going on.  More often than not, he never tells you exactly  what's going on, but only nudges you in the general direction.  The stories  slowly get stranger and stranger as you make your way through this  well-written book.  A couple big themes soon emerge which tie the stories  together rather impressively.  First off, Clegg seems to be fascinated with  the idea of religion and penance.  Characters are often trying to atone for  things they have done.  The concept of brutality as an act of love is also  present in several of the stories (as in &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; where  George kills Lenny out of his love for him).  Flowers, vaginas and various  types of openings are a symbol which shows up repeatedly.  Clegg's stories  often deal with the origins and endings of things, with the physicality of  life and death and the doorways that communicate between the two  worlds.<br />I thought The Nightmare Chronicles was a very well-written, truly  scary collection of stories, and I would easily give it five stars for the  writing alone.  However, I felt the stories tended heavily toward the  darker side of the spectrum.  So if you're not into delving the pyschology  of the insane and the ruthless, as I tend not to be, these stories may not  be your exact cup of tea.  But no matter what, you're bound to appreciate  Clegg's well-honed story-telling skills.  That's what got me in the end.<br />Also worth noting, this book just recently won the Bram Stoker Award for  best horror collection.right away was the amount of small, perceptive,  telling detail with which Clegg imbues his writing.

When I found out there was going to be a movie of it coming out, I decided to look the book up on Amazon.com and read some reviews.  Wow!  I've never seen so many  five-star reviews for anything.  Not Citizen Kane, Star Wars, Animal House,  Shakespeare, not even the Bible.  I figured it was time I give the book a  shot.  Now that I've read it, I can add my opinion to this ever-expanding  forum.<br />I think I should premise my remarks with a couple of preliminary  statements.  First, I'm 27 years old and I've been a huge fan of science  fiction since I saw Star Wars when I was four.  I've read one previous book  by Orson Scott Card:  the novelization of James Cameron's The Abyss, which  I thought was pretty good.  I know Ender's Game is a very well-loved book,  and in expressing my opinion, I'm not trying to anger anyone, but am just  trying to say what I feel.  Here goes...<br />I really wanted to like Ender's  Game, but I just didn't think it was all that great.  It wasn't bad, but it  just never really involved me the way that a great book does.  What  bothered me first off was the quality of the writing.  I thought it was  extremely poor in places, and at best mediocre.  Card doesn't even seem to  follow the basic conventions of fiction writing.  He'll be in a  third-person descriptive paragraph and then throw in a first-person thought  mid-stream without any set-up.  I found this kind of thing distracting.  It's not that the rules and conventions of writing shouldn't be challenged  and bent (good writers are always doing this) it's just that I felt in this  case, it wasn't Card using artistic license, but rather just writing  poorly.<br />Other aspects of the writing itself bothered me.  The lack of  vivid description was one of them.  Except for in the case of some of the  better action sequences, I generally felt that I was reading about  something that had happened to somebody else instead of feeling like I was  there experiencing it myself.  That's the first job of any great writer, to  be able to paint with words in a nuanced way that makes the reader feel he  or she is uniquely experiencing the world of the story in the first person.  I never felt that in Ender's Game.  Also I felt the language was overly  simplistic and at times unceasingly idiotic.  What's with all the fart  talk?  Surely by having them use a certain amount of slang, Card is  reminding us that his characters are children.  But I really got tired of  reading the word &quot;farteater&quot; after a couple dozen times.  That  one in particular became very grating.  Even the adults say it to one  another.  Coupled with the weak writing, the language choice and crude  dialogue just seemed to undermine the integrity of the story-telling.<br />Now  on to character.  I just felt these characters weren't very deeply drawn.  I wanted to sympathize with Ender, but from the beginning, didn't feel very  close to him.  He's supposed to be superhuman (either a Christ-like figure  or a second coming of Hitler, or maybe a mixture of the two, depending on  how you read the character) and I felt this just made me feel extremely  distant from him.  I could never see myself making any of the choices he  makes.  There's too much cold calculation in Ender, and not enough genuine  human feeling.  I felt that Card's attempt to humanize the character  through his relationship with his sister Valentine was forced.  There's a  lot of telling in this book.  Card tells us that Ender loves his sister,  that Ender is a genius, that Ender is afraid of becoming the killer that  his brother Peter is, but there is precious little showing.  There was  never a quality scene between Ender and his sister that made me feel what  they felt for each other.  I have a sister that I love very much and I know  what that love feels like, but I never felt those kinds offeelings while  reading about these characters.<br />I don't want to be overly critical.  There were some good things in this book, too.  It was definitely a  page-turner.  Despite my earlier criticisms about the writing, the story  itself is well put-together.  Once you get involved, you're compelled to  finish it.  If you're a somewhat fast reader, you probably won't need to  bother with a bookmark for this one.  Also, I would say overall it was a  pretty fun read.  I'll give this book three stars, because I think there's  some great potential here that, in my opinion, is just not fulfilled.<br />I  don't mean to slam this book if it's your favorite.  I don't like it when  some one says this or that is a &quot;bad book&quot; or a &quot;bad  movie&quot; period.  I don't believe in those kinds of absolute labels.  Every reader brings something unique to a work of fiction and experiences  it on a special plane that no one else can ever quite know, even if that  other person is your twin brother and has read all of the same books you've  ever read and seen all the same movies and known all of the same friends.  The experience of reading a book is a magic one, a sacred one even.  If you  loved Ender's Game, I have nothing bad to say about that.  In fact, I think  books are a great thing to be passionate about.  This one just didn't do it  for me.  My favorite science fiction book is hands-down Hyperion by Dan  Simmons.  That whole series, in my opinion, is some of the best written,  most thought-provoking, emotionally-involving storytelling out there.  Thanks for your time.

US	50695806	R1P2ETSR6JNUS3	0553293362	834333861	Second Foundation	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A Thrilling Game of Chess	This final installment of Asimov's classic Foundation trilogy contains all of the excitement and subterfuge of a well-played game of chess.  Actually, in this book, you get two games for the price of one, since the book consists of two novellas detailing the search for the ellusive Second  Foundation.<br />If you've read the first two books in the series, you know  that there was a man named Seldon who had a plan to save our future society  from a long cold winter of discontent.  Then came along an unpredicted  rogue element, the mysterious Mule, the perfect monkey wrench to foul up  Seldon's works.<br />In the first novella of this book, the Mule uses his  emotion-controlling abilities to search for the Second Foundation.  This  section is very tightly plotted and there are enough well placed zigs and  zags along the way to keep you addictively turning the pages.<br />The second  novella deals with the search by the First Foundation for its shadowy twin.  Here Asimov introduces Arkadia Darell, a precocious 14-year old girl who  has the ability to out-wit most of the adults around her.  I only wish  Asimov had spent more of the story with her, because I thought she was  probably the most interesting character in the book, along with the Mule.  The tightness of plotting in this second novella is probably twice that of  the first.  The suspense and tension just builds and builds until you don't  think you can take it much more.  If you're a slow reader, like I am,  you'll find that the need to find out what happens will make you into a  fast one.<br />I don't think &quot;Second Foundation&quot; is a perfect book,  so I hesitate to give it five stars, but it definitely is a very good, very  entertaining book.  Having read the entire original trilogy now, I'd say  most of the same strengths and weaknesses apply to all three books.  Asimov  is clearly a master of &quot;the great idea&quot;.  I love the whole  concept of Psychohistory and the Seldon plan and the Seldon crises.  He's  an excellent story-teller in terms of knowing how to turn the tuning pegs  of his plot until the strings are so tight that they sing every time a  light breeze blows through.<br />I'd say Asimov's one weakness is in the  writing of his characters.  It's sort of ironic that in this trilogy all  about the psychology of human motivation there would be relatively little  psychological subtext to the characters.  We never get to know many of the  characters much more than from skin-level.  I felt I never really  identified with any of the characters in a truly human way.<br />I don't mean  to be overly critical of this one aspect of the trilogy.  I still think  they're very very good books and in fact feel that Asimov's purpose was to  draw attention away from the individual characters.  As Seldon himself  repeatedly says, there's no accounting for indiviudal behavior.  I think  Asimov knew that his strengths were in analyzing and commenting on humanity  as a whole.  He's brilliant at that, and his ideas and concepts are  terrific.  He paints on a wide enough canvas here that the dance of ideas  he presents can be appreciated in much the same way that the fine dance of  human emotion might be appreciated in the works of other great  authors.<br />This trilogy is a must-read for any lover of science fiction,  psychology, or great ideas.  It's also good reading for any chess players  out there.ises.

I still think  they're very very good books and in fact feel that Asimov's purpose was to  draw attention away from the individual characters.  As Seldon himself  repeatedly says, there's no accounting for indiviudal behavior.  I think  Asimov knew that his strengths were in analyzing and commenting on humanity  as a whole.  He's brilliant at that, and his ideas and concepts are  terrific.  He paints on a wide enough canvas here that the dance of ideas  he presents can be appreciated in much the same way that the fine dance of  human emotion might be appreciated in the works of other great  authors.<br />This trilogy is a must-read for any lover of science fiction,  psychology, or great ideas.  It's also good reading for any chess players  out there.	2000-04-27

I know I must talk  about it a lot, because one day my girlfriend brought me this book and  said, &quot;I found something you have to read.&quot;  From the cover and  the write-up on the back, &quot;Montana 1948&quot; looked like it might be  a nostalgic, bittersweet coming-of-age tale set in the Big Sky state.<br />It  is all of those things, but it's more.  Larry Watson spins a poignant,  compelling narrative that deals with family, secrecy, innocence and  corruption in a very moving way.  The book's opening section gives a  longish description of the setting.  Soon after, drama unfolds and the plot  becomes as thick as that of a mystery novel.  As I was reading the book, I  thought that I would probably give it a four star rating.  But the ending  was so beautifully moving that it bumped itself up.<br />The story is  interesting and thought-provoking and the writing is lean but never  pretentious.  What I liked most about this book, though, was the rich  characterization and the great pleasure I took in reading a well-told  story.  You'll enjoy this short, great novel, even if you've never thought  twice about Montana.	2000-04-19

And Other Stories	Books	5	20	21	N	N	The Real Stuff	I've been a big fan of Ray Bradbury for ten years now, since my high school American Lit teacher gave me &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; to take home over Christmas break.  It wasn't assigned reading, but he knew I liked to  read, as he did, and he thought I might like it.  He was right.  Actually,  I loved it.  In the years since I've read almost all of Bradbury's writing  and I've been consistently impressed.  Bradbury is a short-story-writing  poet whose subject is the intangible wonder we all experience in our finest  moments of living and dreaming.  Those moments are often far-too-fleeting,  but Ray Bradbury knows how to chase them down with his typewriter.  I've  never read a Ray Bradbury book that didn't make me feel wonderfully  alive.<br /> When I began reading &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; I  was a little worried that it wasn't up to the par of his other short story  collections.  Bradbury sometimes writes in broad strokes that result in  unfulfilling caricature.  I felt this was true of the first couple stories.  But after that, the book really took off, and I felt he was firing on all  cylinders again and again.  &quot;Yes, We'll Gather at the River&quot; has  to be one of my favorite Bradbury stories.  &quot;Night Call,  Collect,&quot; the title story, &quot;Any Friend of Nicholas Nickleby's Is  a Friend of Mine,&quot; and &quot;The Man in the Rorschach Shirt&quot; are  other high points in the collection.  He also takes some stylistic  excursions in this book.  &quot;Heavy-Set&quot; is an excellent prose  portrait, but is not really like anything else he's written.  There is also  a poem included as the last entry in the book.  If you've never read  anything by Ray Bradbury, I highly recommend you pick up one of his many  fine books.  &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; is right up with the best  of them.	2000-04-12
US	50695806	R28J7RBYUFA0RH	0061091995	952069519	Sacrament	Books	4	26	29	N	N	Very good, if not quite wonderful	I bought &quot;Sacrament&quot; a few years ago when it first came out in hardcover (at a bookstore in the mall in Pennsylvania where George Romero filmed &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;).  I thought it would be cool to have a  Clive Barker book that had breathed that air.  But for some reason, I never  read the book until just recently.  I had read everything Clive Barker had  written up to then and have now read all of his books except for  &quot;Galilee,&quot; which I plan to read soon.<br />&quot;Sacrament&quot; is  a good book, and at times a very good book (there are occasional flashes of  brilliance), but it never quite achieves the imaginative momentum to crest  the &quot;wonderful book&quot; horizon as &quot;Weaveworld,&quot;  &quot;Damnation Game&quot; or some of the &quot;Books of Blood&quot;  did.<br />I really enjoyed reading this book, but felt that the narrative  meandered at times and the book probably could have been about 100 pages  shorter.  Barker does grapple with some deep and moving themes, however,  and this book is definitely worth the read.<br />The protagonist, Will  Rabjohns, a nature photographer, obsessed since childhood with bearing  witness to the terrible end of things, is a well-drawn character that will  illicit the reader's empathy and involvement in the story.  Will must come  to terms with what it means to be a living (and therefore mortal) creature  in the world.  He also comes to appreciate the pain and joy that come from  realizing that we are responible for the creation of our own selves.<br />An  entertaining and thought-provoking book.  More grounded in the spiritual  dilemmas of our world than many of Barker's other excellent fantasy tales.	2000-02-20
US	50695806	R2OS1CKBLBIURH	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Scary and Beautiful	This is a compelling book.  It's both scary and heartbreaking as well as beautifully poetic at moments.<br />The language is dense at times.  Golding is one of those authors that takes extreme effort packing meaning and  evocation in each word.  Sometimes it's an effort to read them, but it's  ultimately well worth the effort.<br />A must-read about the horror and  fragile beauty inherent in being a member of the human race.<br />If you enjoy  reading &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; I highly recommend Stephen King's  excellent new book, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; which uses &quot;Lord  of the Flies&quot; as a sort of departure point for an impressive  coming-of-age story set against the Vietnam war.	2000-01-21
US	50695806	R3EG52FKGXM3YT	0684853515	692650386	Hearts In Atlantis	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Probably King's best	I've been one of Stephen King's Constant Readers for fifteen years now.  I was 12 when I caught the reading bug big-time (from a book called &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;), and have thankfully never been cured of it.  Reading has  probably been the greatest pleasure in my life, and Stephen King's been  there with me like an old friend from the beginning.  For years, my  favorite book of his was &quot;It.&quot;  I just love the way Stephen King  can so accurately and knowingly evoke the wonders of childhood, and make  you so glad to be alive and to make you feel, from your own experiences,  that you know exactly what he's talking about (even if you grew up in the  '80s instead of in the '50s).  He's got a terrific imagination and a  great sense of story and skill for evoking very deep, stirring human  feelings.  I've read every book Stephen King has written, and though I've  enjoyed many of his recent books, I've felt that most of them weren't on  the par with his best writing (I would make the exceptions of the excellent  &quot;Green Mile&quot; and the better parts of &quot;The Dark Tower  IV.&quot;  That is why I was so pleasantly surprised when I picked up  &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot;  I repeatedly found myself setting the book  down at the end of a chapter and saying aloud, &quot;Damn, this is a good  book.&quot;  It really is. A wonderful book from a wonderful writer.  If  you've ever really loved a Stephen King book, don't think twice about  getting this one.  You'll be glad you did.<br />If you don't read Stephen  King, you should start with &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot;  The first two  of the five linked stories in the book are as good or better than anything  he has ever written, and the other three are quite good, too.	2000-01-11
