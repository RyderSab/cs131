The book was published in December 2003, and so includes the first two seasons of the show.<br /><br />For anyone interested in the business side of the pop music industry (and the entertainment industry in general), this book should be inspiring. Simon describes how he constantly had to fight to convince record execs that his vision was true and profitable. There are also many juicy stories along the way involving Eddie Murphy, David Hasselhoff, and Ryan Seacrest among others.<br /><br />But for me, the real strength of this biography is the inspiring tale of Simon's persistence and business savvy as he rose through the ranks of the music industry to become the world's best known (and maybe most hated) music producer. Simon clearly explains what makes Clay Aiken, Ruben Studdard, and Kelly Clarkson stand out from so many other talented singers, and the lasting impression is that anyone who is willing to work hard enough, has luck and talent on their side, has stage presence, mental focus, and at least some business savvy can succeed in the entertainment industry.<br /><br />In many ways, it is a business just like any other. This book is a roadmap to success.<br /><br />Stacey Cochran<br />[[ASIN:B0024NL6QS Author of CLAWS available for 80 Cents]]	2005-02-14

The Running Man may well be the most stunningly prophetic novel Stephen King ever wrote. 50 pages from the end of the novel, I realized he was going to have Ben Richards fly a plane into the side of a New York City skyscraper. The passage is worth quoting:<br /><br />\\"Heeling over slightly, the Lockheed struck the Games Building dead on, three quarters of the way up. Its tanks were still better than a quarter full. Its speed was slightly over five hundred miles an hour. The explosion was tremendous, lighting up the night like the wrath of God, and it rained fire twenty blocks away.\\"<br /><br />The Running Man was published in 1982.<br /><br />Aside from what may have just been a stunning fictional coincidence of what we've all come to know in our own post-9/11 lives, the story of The Running Man itself may well be the most thoroughly entertaining novel of King's career. In the introduction to the collection from which I read, he mentions that he wrote it in a 72-hour period and published it with little or no edits.<br /><br />What The Running Man may lack in polish and grammatical acumen, it makes up for with sheer energy and a torrential pace unlike any other novel I've ever read. It may well be the fastest read you will ever experience. It's like one of those super-high-speed rollercoasters that can do upwards of 150 miles per hour. It's extremely intense, extremely fast, and extremely fun.<br /><br />The book and the movie are different. The book sets up Ben Richards as a family man who has no other choice than to go on this game show called \\"The Running Man,\\" wherein contestants are hunted down and killed for the entertainment pleasure of television audiences. Ben's young daughter is dying of pneumonia, and he and his wife don't have the money to take her to a doctor. If he wins the game show, he saves his daughter; he's a ready-made hero you absolutely want to cheer for!<br /><br />Also, the book allows Ben the entire landscape of New England in which to run, so we see him in New York and Boston and in the skies over Pennsylvania. Similar to the movie, Ben turns out to be more resourceful than executives with the game show had anticipated, and he ends up killing a lot of people.<br /><br />The Running Man is not a novel for everyone, but if you do want to read it, chances are you'll end up loving it. It's a great read, and I highly recommend it. It's one of those early Stephen King novels for which I would love to see a new movie version; I think a new movie could be very effective if it brought in Ben as the desperate family man we see in the book; it could entertain a new generation. I think people would like to see it. I guess I just wish there were more sci-fi novels like this, man. It's really a classic. And, of course, I hope this review is helpful to you!<br /><br />Stacey Cochran, author of The Kiribati Testin which to run, so we see him in New York and Boston and in the skies over Pennsylvania.

From there, the pace is unflagging and the story follows through to its logical ending.<br /><br /> Intensity was a straight-ahead thriller in the tradition of Silence of the Lambs.

The two biographies are different in their perceptions of Disney, and it could make a difference for you, dear reader, regarding which one you want to read first.<br /><br />I would describe Mosley's biography as \\"more realistic\\" than Thomas's, but I would say that Bob Thomas's was more inspiring to read. Mosley doesn't hesitate to describe Walt as an ill-tempered ringleader who suffered from emotional instability in his early adulthood, whereas Bob Thomas's portrays such behavior in a more favorable light and seems to grant that it is the stuff of genius. One very clear example: Mosley describes Walt's suicide attempt at 31 where Lillian Disney found her husband out cold with sleeping pills and booze, called a doctor, and had Walt's stomach pumped. In Bob Thomas's book, there is no mention of this incident whatsoever.<br /><br />Both books describe Disney as an inspiration to the people around him, but I think Mosley's goes more in-depth into Walt's character and describes more thoroughly some of the difficulties associated with working with him. What Mosley describes as \\"overbearing,\\" Thomas would call \\"entrepreneurial.\\" What Mosley would call \\"unstable,\\" Bob Thomas would call \\"emotionally invigorating.\\" The point is: the subject is the same; it's the perception of the subject that's different in the two biographies.<br /><br />I think both do a great service to the world in representing quite possibly the most influential voice in 20th century entertainment. It's a fascinating reading, and it will excite you to explore your own creativity. Walt Disney was a man that would risk everything to make people laugh, to entertain, to push the medium of film, cartoons, and theme parks to a level unlike anything anyone had ever seen before.

Mountain Lions Frequenting This Area --Be Alert--	Cat Attacks was a really cool book. All of the stories collected in this volume are true stories of real people who were attacked or killed by mountain lions. It is written in an energetic style that really puts the reader into each of the scenes. There are graphs that describe the number and demographics of recent trends involving human-puma encounters. Probably of most interest though is that fact that the writers of this book do not approach mountain lions from a tree-hugger perspective, which is rare for book on mountain lions. It is an exciting read, and some of the chapter titles may give you an indication of the kind of mountain lion book this is (for example, \\"Profile of the Killer\\"; \\"A Father's Nightmare\\"; \\"Hunting the Truth\\"; \\"Into the Jaws of Death\\"; \\"Stalked\\"; and \\"Hard Truths\\" to name just a few).<br /><br />Most of the stories are re-created as though you're there on the trail with these people as they're attacked: Barbara Schoener, for instance, when she was attacked and killed near the American River on the Western States Trail. Or there with Cindy Parolin when she wrestled with a cougar to save her six-year-old son. Or the Cuyamaca State Park stories near San Diego with ranger Laura Itogawa where mountain lions seem to be unusually aggressive and have attacked people a number of times.<br /><br />This book dispels many of the popular myths, most of which ironically, have sprung up because of conservationist efforts in the past fifty years. Because I live in a remote area of Arizona and I often go for long-distance jogs alone, I can not tell you how helpful (and welcome) this book was. Most other cougar books I researched painted the mountain lion out to be a wonderful, beautiful animal and glossed over the very real facts (some times quite literally with beautiful photographs) that this animal has attacked nearly 60 people in the US and Canada since 1986.<br /><br />Despite the fact that cougar numbers are at their all-time highest in 150 years, the general belief is that the animal is endangered. This book offers a very different perspective in the question as to who really is the endangered species.<br /><br />Stacey Cochran<br />[[ASIN:B0024NL6QS Author of CLAWS available for 80 cents]]the animal is endangered.

In a video rental store, he saw a copy of Lars Von Trier's Kingdom Hospital, and he rented it and watched it in the very same town (Estes Park) where, nearly twenty years earlier, he was inspired to write The Shining. (see[...] for a wonderful interview with Kingdom Hospital's director Mark Carliner that explains these origins in detail).<br /><br />No one was able to secure the rights nor much interest in what Stephen King initially saw as a potential hit-TV show, until fate intervened three years later, and King was struck by a van and nearly died. While recovering from the accident, Stephen King spent a lot of time in hospitals, and Von Trier's idea recurred to him. He wrote 15 hours of television scripts for a new TV show, Kingdom Hospital. Based largely on those scripts, ABC secured the rights to Von Trier's original idea, and preproduction began on the show.<br /><br />The Journals of Eleanor Druse is a 244-page fictional account of a woman who visits that hospital in Lewiston, Maine, only to discover that the hospital has a sordid history and may be haunted. The story is told in the 1st-person point of view of this old lady who most people think is more than a little daffy. Eleanor claims to hear a young girl crying in the hospital's elevator, and the story takes on a conspiracy tone wherein the doctors do not believe Eleanor (or are trying to cover up what she knows). Keep in mind all of this is told from Eleanor's perspective, and as such the credibility of the narrator itself becomes suspect, which is also part of the fun of the novel.<br /><br />To me, the most interesting idea King develops in The Journals of Eleanor Druse is the conflict that occurs when someone believes they've experienced a religious event, and scientists tell them that what happened was only the result of chemicals in their brain. In Eleanor's case, she is thought to be epileptic. Some of our very best writers (see Connie Willis's \\"Passage\\" and to some degree Carl Sagan's \\"Contact\\") in the past few years seem to be exploring that division between what constitutes a religious experience and what is merely a result of too much serotonin in the temporal lobe. Is humanity's belief in God some mass delusion caused by a species with highly evolved imaginative faculties? It's a hell of a question, and one (as a young fiction writer myself) I will probably explore in several novels during the next decade.<br /><br />The Journals of Eleanor Druse only offers glancing shots at this very profound question, and with blurbs like \\"Watch Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital on ABC-TV\\" on the cover of the book, it's tempting to write this book off as an extended ad to help build hype for a TV show. There are very few books that Stephen King has written in the past decade that have genuinely captured my interest, and I only wish the so-called \\"Master of Horror Fiction\\" would act more like a Master than the witty used-car salesman he seems content to be.<br /><br />Stacey Cochran<br />[[ASIN:B0024NL6QS Author of CLAWS available for 80 cents]].

Two weeks ago I had never heard of John Wyndham, but I found his name in [...] fiction archive, and I looked up his books here at Amazon.<br /><br />The opening scene in Triffids is mesmerizing. The basic premise of the book is that a meteor shower blinds most of the world population, except for a handful of people. One of lucky ones is Bill Masen, who was in a hospital with bandages over his eyes and was not able to watch the meteor shower. Towards the end of the book, narrator Masen speculates that the meteor shower might have been caused by man-made satellites orbiting Earth, and indeed, the whole apocalyptic vision of the novel voices the concerns any sane human being would have had shortly after WWII and the discovery of the destructive power of atomic energy.<br /><br />That said, the novel is not at all a doom and gloom book. It is actually quite hopeful, optimistic, and funny. There is a romantic subplot wherein Bill meets a charming woman named Josella Payton, only to be separated from her in the aftermath of the devastating meteor shower. A good part of the book follows Bill's search for Josella through various malevolent organizations that spring up in the months after the meteor shower.<br /><br />Developing alongside this story line, is the story of the triffids, a kind of six-foot-tall Venus Flytrap with a stinging whip that has the ability to pick up its roots and walk around. In the wake of world blindness, these plants begin attacking people who stumble blindly around London and the English countryside outside of London.<br /><br />The novel has a very solid ending that made me feel happy to have read the book. It was such a good story I'm going to see if I can get a copy of Wyndham's other classic bestseller, The Cuckoo's of Midwich. I highly recommend Day of the Triffids to any sci-fi fan, as well as to anyone who likes a good old-fashioned white-knuckle yarn.

Dick's short stories as a whole. For none of the stories in this collection did Philip K. Dick earn more than 250 dollars. \\"Paycheck\\" the movie (as of writing this review) has grossed over $53,000,000 worldwide. A pocketful of miracles, indeed.<br /><br />Philip K. Dick may have been the best _idea_ fiction writer who ever lived. His ideas for plots are at once pulpish, deeply metaphysical, and as original as any 20th century writer, and the stories in The Philip K. Dick Reader are as good an introduction to Dick as any other collection I've been able to find. Here you'll find the original stories that inspired Total Recall, Screamers, Paycheck, The Minority Report, and part of the fun in reading this collection comes with seeing the differences between what Philip K. Dick originally wrote and what was realized on film. But there are many quality stories here, too, that haven't been filmed. A few of them include:<br /><br />\\"Strange Eden\\" -- a wonderfully imagined, eerie story of a space pilot who finds an alluring woman on a peaceful, Eden-like planet where nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />\\"Sales Pitch\\" -- a hilarious story about an automatic sales robot that drives a man over the edge. I couldn't help but think about the 20+ emails I receive each day trying to sell me stuff, on-line  pop-up windows, and, to me, the story seems prophetic.<br /><br />\\"Exhibit Piece\\" -- the quintessential Philip K. Dick story; a futuristic museum curator stumbles into a 20th century exhibit only to find that it is utterly real to him. The emotion that Dick employs when the George Miller's co-workers at the museum don't believe his story was heartrending to read.<br /><br />\\"Foster, You're Dead\\" -- turns a satirical eye to the nuclear paranoia of the 50s and 60s, a time when people actually bought bomb shelters for their homes the way you might buy a TV or new washer machine.<br /><br />The highlight of this collection, though, are the stories \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,\\" \\"Second Variety,\\" \\"Paycheck,\\", and \\"The Minority Report,\\" which have each been made into highly successful movies. These stories are flat-out as good as any science fiction stories out there. Dick wrote of hugely metaphysical ideas in a language that was prosaic and fun, and he placed his ideas in plots that combined mystery and intrigue as well as any science fiction writer before or since. I highly recommend \\"The Philip K. Dick Reader\\" to any short story fan as well as to anyone looking for a solid introduction to the fiction of Philip K. Dick.

This was the most inspiring biography I have ever read. I bought it while on vacation at Disneyworld in Orlando this past November with my girlfriend and family, and I couldn't stop reading it. I found the most interesting period of his life to be the years between 20-35, when no one would give him a chance. I am a fiction writer who has written seven novels in the past decade (my 20s), and each of them has been rejected so many times I don't even want to think about it. I can not tell you how difficult it is to put everything I am as a human being into something I believe in and to face as much disinterest from agents, publishers, editors, magazines, and universities as I have.<br /><br />Many of Disney's friends gave up on him. Even his family began to think he was crazy.<br /><br />To read that Walt Disney went through a very similar period in his life to what I'm currently going through was like giving me a light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel. It made me hope. And when a book can do that, you know it is something special, man.

You know, those little moments where your mind tells you that what just happened implies something more than what it seems to be, that there are forces at work beyond the boring mechanistic view whith which we are led to believe our lives exist. You are looking for a book that describes your life as more meaningful than you fear it might be. Carl Jung's \\"Synchronicity\\" may be just that book:~)<br /><br />What Jung sets out to describe in \\"Synchronicity\\" is proof that there is a higher degree of meaningful coincidences in our Universe than probability allows for. His chief pieces of evidence are the Zenor Card experiments carried out by J.B. Rhine in the 1930s and 40s, and his own \\"Astrological Experiment.\\" Following these two pieces of evidence, Jung touches on the history of intellectuals who have tried to explain the very same thing he sets out to explain, and here he draws heavily on the I Ching.<br /><br />\\"Synchronicity\\" was a book that I was very interested in reading, but now that I've read it, I am wondering exactly what it is that I've just read (and whether I learned anything from it). Jung takes as proof the quantum idea that even at its most fundamental level, our Universe behaves in \\"non-linear\\" acausal ways. He draws on the scientific ideas of Einstein and Pauli in order to make psychic generalizations for the way the human mind and the imagination works.<br /><br />The ideas are fascinating to consider, but may be all but impossible to prove. Some of the examples Jung uses to illustrate acausal \\"meaningful coincidence\\" behavior are startling. My only word of caution with this book is that it might be a little too dense for some readers. All in all, though it's as good an introduction into synchronicity and meaningful coincidence as any book of its kind. Chances are, after reading \\"Synchronicity,\\" you may want a more clear explanation of the ideas Jung is describing here, and there are a wealth of resources that have elaborated further on Jung's original concepts.

Thank you, Barbara, for recognizing that my June 18, 2003 review was mostly positive. Yours too was positive, pleasant, and very thought provoking. First, I should say that Michael Crichton's The Terminal Man is one of my favorite novels. Ironically, however, there are many other Crichton novels that seem better researched and better crafted (for example, Crichton spent some 20 years combing over a good ending for Sphere, and Jurassic Park went through several early drafts before arriving at an &quot;adult&quot; 3rd person objective perspective from which to tell the story).<br />To me, The Terminal Man is an early Crichton novel, and it is a sci-fi novel of the kind a person growing up in the 40s and 50s might have seen in the old Ace-Double sci-fi series or magazines like Analog and Astounding Science Fiction. These were great pulp-style science fiction magazines, and the stories represented there reflected that &quot;pulp&quot; mentality where the emphasis most often was on plot rather than fact or accuracy. I, for one, love those kinds of stories, and wish there were more of them (check out my website for publication news on my The Colorado Sequence, a novel very much informed by that Invasion of the Body Snatchers/Who Goes There?/40s&amp;50s-pulp style sience fiction mentality).<br />I think that's the class that The Terminal Man belongs to; novels where the emphasis is on fun rather than fact. And an entire generation of writers and moviemakers (from Michael Crichton, to George Lucas, to Stephen King, to Speilberg's Jaws-Close Encounters-Indiana Jones era) was informed by that kind of 40s and 50s style pulp science fiction. While the ideas in Crichton's The Terminal Man do have some degree of believability I think his later novels (Rising Sun, Jurassic Park, on up to Prey) exhibit a better balance of factual believability alongside great storytelling plots.<br />Thanks for the insight and for making me think, Barbara.<br />Yours,<br />Stacey Cochrants.<br />Thanks for the insight and for making me think, Barbara.<br />Yours,<BR>Stacey Cochran	2003-11-17

The prose is so high energy it shines, but a quick glance of the first page of customer reviews makes me nervous about writing a positive review of this book (most of you guys are dissing Pelecanos's effort, it looks like). I think King Suckerman was intended as an action-comedy, sort of a Sergio Leone-meets-Shaft novel where the message is that friendship and loyalty rises above. Pelecanos riffs freely on subjects from reefer, to DC basketball, to violence, to the real question at each of our hearts: was Jimi Hendrix a rock musician, or a soul musician?<br />All of this lightly covers some heavier issues underneath the surface of King Suckerman; chiefly race, drugs, and violence in our nation's capitol. Marcus Clay is a black DC record store owner (Real Right Records) and Demitri Karras is a young white man with no clear direction in his life. The two play ball together on DC's famed city courts, and when a simple drug deal draws Clay into pulling a gun on a local dealer, Karras and Clay become the subject of the dealer's (and some out of town boys') revenge.<br />The novel follows a pretty tight storyline from there with the redneck goons tracking down Karras and Clay, ultimately leading to the novel's The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly style climax on a DC bicentenial July 4th with fireworks exploding in the background!<br />As with other Pelecanos novels (Right as Rain, Shame the Devil, Soul Circus, The Sweet Forever), King Suckerman is a deeply moral novel where redemption and loyalty rises above ignorance and hatred. There is an interesting passage in Suckerman where Karras finds out that a young kid he's sold some dope to has died in an automobile accident, and for a time he seems torn, trying to choose between right and wrong, friendship and honor. At the end of the novel, Karras does have a focus and a responsibility, and through friendship, he comes to be a more mature character. It's the kind of ending that leaves you wanting to see what'll happen next in Karras's life, now that he has matured. Fortunately, that novel has been written (Shame the Devil) and is every bit as intense and powerful as King Suckerman. If you're new to Pelecanos, my best recommendation would be to read his more recents books (or to check out HBO's The Wire, for which he writing this season) and see if his style appeals to you. If it does, you'll eventually want to read King Suckerman because it is one of the brightest, funniest novels in Pelecanos's ouvre. I highly recommend this novel!<br />Staceyg to see what'll happen next in Karras's life, now that he has matured.

I checked this book out at the local library and read through the opening 130 pages in one sitting until I was falling asleep at three in the morning. Lewis Carroll's classic tale of adventure and fantasy \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the best books I've ever read.<br />The story is about a little girl, Alice, who falls into a very deep rabbit hole, seemingly straight to the middle of the earth! Her adventures once she lands are as wonderfully imagined as any in the history of literature. Her encounters with the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, The Mock Turtle, The Gryphon, and The Wise Old Caterpillar are as fun and as pure and as well intended as any characters I've ever read a writer write.<br />The story behind how Alice in Wonderland came to be is equally interesting, and one worth reading up on. That Carroll wrote it without any pretension to selling it, or for money, or even to publish it, is truly one of the remarkable stories of world literature. His motives were pure, and (at least to me) this is one of the reasons why this book is so dear and so readable.<br />I highly recommend \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to readers young and old and can only say that I look forward to reading \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" next! A marvelous, wonderful book, as fun as any book I've ever read.<br />Yours,<br />Stacey	2003-09-22
US	50154126	R19XJXHZISJVGI	0345423496	284653366	3001: The Final Odyssey	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Well-Written, Fun Read	This was my first Arthur C. Clarke novel. Like a lot of people I've seen the Kubrick movie several times and I've known _of_ Clarke, but I had never read any of Clarke's novels. Though this is the last book in a trilogy, I had no trouble getting into the story.<br />A body is found floating out in space, and when a space tug Goliath hauls it in we find it is Frank Poole, who has been presumed dead or missing for 1000 years. Due to the deep freeze of space, Poole is able to be revived and is amazed to discover 1000 years has passed. All the people he knows are dead, the life that he knew is long since gone, but curiously he is the subject of much attention, as he is a historical curiosity. People want to meet him and talk with him, and he becomes a kind of a celebrity.<br />Part of the fun of the novel comes with Clarke's showing how a person suddenly tranferred 1000 years into the future would have to deal with all the changes that have happened to society, and Clarke's wit and charm shine very brightly in a lot of these instances. My favorite of the changes was the Five Towers that have been erected over every continent on Earth that act as a sort of giant elevator from ground level up into space. This was a very vivid image and Clarke seemed to have fun with it. Conversely, I thought the Dragon Scene was a little off course. It just didn't make sense in the natural progression of a realistically-told sci-fi novel to introduce a woman flying on the back of a dragon, even if it turns out to be a technological device.<br />But Clarke recovers nicely and moves his plot moves on to more recognizable things like the Europa monolith, Hal, and the voice of Poole's old shipmate Dave Bowman. Poole acts a messenger sent to communicate with the monolith which has integrated Dave Bowman into itself. We learn more about the monolith, its origins and its purpose, and the novel builds to an exciting ending wherein the course of human evolution may be altered forever.<br />3001: The Final Odyssey was great fun to read. It is a story by a master of the genre. I do see how that if you are a regular sci-fi reader, this novel might be a bit slow for you, and a number of other customer reviews have touched on that. Clarke seems to be writing science fiction for a mainstream audience. But if you're just looking for a well-written, fun read to spend a few hours away from the hum-drum world we all have to live in 3001: The Final Odyssey is a great place to begin.<br />Sincerely yours,<br />StaceyThe Final Odyssey was great fun to read.

It took about a week's worth of reading \\"And Then There Were None\\" a couple hours each night to complete, but this is the kind of novel you could mow through in a single day. I was hooked by page ten in no small part because of Christie's ability to revolve swiftly through the cast of characters in setting up her story's premise. That premise has been so overused in Hollywood movies (John Carpenter's \\"The Thing,\\" Arnold Swarzenneger's \\"Predator,\\" and this year's \\"Identity\\") it is truly remarkable to note that it all began with Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians/And Then There Were None in 1939.<br /><br />This is one of those books that you should read in your lifetime, man. It played a key role in elevating mystery/detective fiction to a level that has not been duplicated nor surpassed in more than a half century, and despite many charming and flamboyant egos that have climbed to the highest heights of popular fiction charts none have matched what Agatha Christie brought to our public consciousness when she published And Then There Were None. It epitomizes the word \\"classic\\" in its truest sense. It is _the_ book for you!<br /><br />Stacey<br />author of [[ASIN:1440495343 CLAWS: A Suspense Novel]]	2003-08-27

McGee and LSD became popular about the same time, but the typical bright-eyed MacDonald sense of humor stops there, for One Fearful Yellow Eye is probably too sad a story for all but the most serious fans of the series.<br /><br />Fearful Yellow Eye's plot revolves around a certain 600 grand bequeathed to survivors of Dr. Fortner Geis, a generally well-liked and well-respected Chicago doctor. But when the 600 grand does not turn up following the good doctor's death, McGee is hired onto the case.<br /><br />His investigations lead him to Chicago, Glory Geis, and then the twisted tale of Glory's daughter/love-rival Heidi Geis.<br /><br />Remarkably, McGee finds himself attracted to the broken-winged Heidi, and ultimately the novel is hers. Because it is she that must get past her family's dark secret, and it is she that comes through at the novel's end as a much stronger character.<br /><br />There are moments of poignancy in One Fearful Yellow Eye, and McGee's approach to Heidi's disturbing LSD overdose may be worth the price of the ticket alone, but generally I'd have to recommend several other McGee novel's before One Fearful Yellow Eye. Cinnamon Skin, thusfar, is my favorite.<br /><br />Stacey Cochran<br />author of [[ASIN:1440495343 CLAWS: A Suspense Novel]]	2003-07-28

And there are four books within reach of my writing desk. The most recent addition has been Martha Kolln's Understanding English Grammar. This bad boy has it all, folks. If you're like me, you get tripped up on lie and lay like the rest of us, and those kinds of words (and the rules underlying them) are at the very heart of what UEG sets out to clarify. I think I first went to Kolln's masterpiece for help with prepositions. I don't know who first introduced prepositions into the English language, man, but I'd like beat him with a wet dish rag!<br />As Kolln says on page 320: &quot;Prepositions are among the most difficult words in the language for foreign speakers to master.&quot; I'd take this a step further; I'd say they're the most difficult words for _English_ speakers to master. A couple of examples she lists:<br />Be sure to fill out the form carefully.<br />Be sure to fill in the form carefully.<br />He wasn't fired.<br />He didn't get fired.<br />Can _you_ spot the correct usage above?

The Green Ripper is here to wish all you nice boys and girls a very merry Christmas -- with a machine gun!<br />Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta!<br />John D. MacDonald's classic mystery of love and revenge, religion and fanaticism \\"The Green Ripper\\" may be one of the most chilling entertainment novels I've ever read. Ripper was his seventeenth Travis McGee novel, and MacDonald explores the dark side of religio-terroristic minds with a mastery of craft that left me wondering (in several passages) whether he _identified_ with obsessive minds, or was acerbically satirizing such minds. I think the line between the two is probably thinner than we might -- at first glance -- like to admit.<br />The story begins with McGee's soulmate dying unexpectedly, and inexplicably, and the early pages follow McGee's realization that her death was not accidental -- but was the result of an assassin's dart. And you can't help but wonder.... whether you would be driven to revenge if _your_ wife or loved one was killed in this way. But MacDonald ratchets it up, here, man because McGee finds that the assassins are linked to a religious-terrorist group based in Ukiah, California.<br />And once you open up religion in an entertainment novel, you've got some really rich ground to work. A few of the passages spoken by the religious nuts are so convincing and so sincere, you don't know whether to hate them or relate to them. Indeed, McGee even crosses the line becoming one of the group and by sleeping with a [street walker]-turned-gun-toting machine of destruction.<br />I love this storyline, in that as a writer how obsessive minded are you? Truly great entertainment writers like MacDonald, King, Leonard, Koontz, Mary Higgins Clark (whose Green Ripper blurbs appear on the dust-jacket) know how far you have to push yourself into that world to achieve artistic integrity, and there are times when the difference between being a really good writer and being an obsessive fanatic is subtle as hell.<br />Still, it's safest just to treat a book like The Green Ripper as a metaphor and to take it at face value; that is, as an entertaining mystery thriller. But it's because this novel holds something deeper, I think, that so many intelligent readers can relate to it. A remarkable gem in the Travis McGee jewelry store. And a novel that I -- for one -- highly recommend to all serious-minded fiction readers.<br />Staceyfanatic is subtle as hell.<br />Still, it's safest just to treat a book like The Green Ripper as a metaphor and to take it at face value; that is, as an entertaining mystery thriller.

The story is pretty simple, a futuristic bounty hunter Rick Deckard is commissioned to \\"retire\\" six Nexus-6 androids. The Nexus-6 androids are remarkably human and it is only through the so-called Voight-Kampf test that Deckard can truly tell the androids from the humans. The Voight-Kampf tests androids for empathic responses; that is, the androids will respond callously to the test's life-death questions, whereas humans tend to respond with empathy regarding the destruction of life.<br />Herein lies the novel's poignant irony: Deckard is a human, and he's on a mission to \\"retire\\" the androids using this test. So the question becomes, Who is really human, who really has compassion?<br />I really enjoyed \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" but it is for a very different reason than say a Michael Crichton or Larry Niven novel. Dick's science is a little screwy/funny, but his heart was _so_ in the right place. Reading a Philip K. Dick novel is a little like looking at the wildest of Van Gogh's paintings, you know, where you can feel the desparation in every dash of paint. Technically it looks like the work of a teenager, but there's a grown man's heart on the line underneath the text of this story. And _that_ is why the next science fiction novel I read will most likely be a Philip K. Dick novel.<br />Stacey	2003-07-21

Within hours a Chilean Terrorist group claims responsibility for planting the bomb with intent to kill the famed economist Dr. Meyer. Private Detective Travis McGee is suspicious and tracks Meyer -- a good friend -- down  and finds he was in fact, not aboard the ill-fated boat.<br /><br />Photographs from a nearby boat reveal that a man Evan Lawrence also may not have been aboard the boat. Lawrence recently married Meyer's niece, and when McGee's suspicions seem confirmed, the two friends (he and Meyer) begin a hunt to find out about Evan Lawrence's past.<br /><br />Thus begins Cinnamon Skin, a taut, fun mystery thriller that leads two friends through the criminal past that formed a killer. Some of the most deft touches in the novel come when MacDonald describes the lives of people along the Rio Grande Valley in southwest Texas. At one point, I actually got out a road map and traced their quest from Eagle Pass to El Paso and back all the way to Brownsville. MacDonald blends fact with fiction at just the right pitch in this, his twentieth Travis McGee novel.<br /><br />MacDonald writes like a writer who has earned it, man. He seems to know his story so well, there is very little drift in the way he tells a story. Each sentence is exact or darn near exact, and the end result is a taut mystery that is very fun and very entertaining -- the kind of novel you'll want to talk about with friends.<br /><br />I highly recommend Cinnamon Skin to folks who like good old storytelling at its best, most genuine form. It is the perfect airplane, poolside, vacation novel to help you beat the heat this summer. And its depth will leave you feeling satisfied at any time of year.

Harry Benson is one whacked out dude -- he's got a computer hooked up to his brain, and that computer doesn't much like the world we all have to live in. The Terminal Man is the quintessential potboiler, man, and I highly recommmend it to anyone who likes an entertaining read.<br />I will say the little blurbs on this most recent mass-market paperback release of Crichton's classic are silly. \\"Crichton makes the unbelievable believable\\" says the Washington Post. One wonders if they took these quotes from other Crichton novels and pasted it here because The Terminal Man is the most absurd novel in Crichton's oevre. That is not to say, it isn't entertaining -- entertaining is _all_ it is. But believable? Yeah, if you believe Chewbacca and Han Solo really exist maybe.<br />But The Terminal Man is great fun. It doesn't have to be believable -- in fact, taking it seriously is not so much the novel's fault as the fault of an uptight reader, I'd say.<br />Crichton laid the blueprint here for Stephen King to take up in The Shining, and the similarities between the drooling, mad Harry Benson swinging a fire extinguisher ax and King's Jack Torrance doing the same at the end of The Shining are remarkable.<br />Critics have so not gotten Crichton his whole career, and I think that's a shame. Part of it is Crichton's fault sure, but part of it resides in the fact that certain readers insist his fiction is \\"believable\\" or \\"unbelievable\\" -- serious social commentary, or entertainment pastiche. What bugs me as a young novelist is that critical opinion can't seem to accept an inherent value in the purely entertaining. The Terminal Man is an entertaining novel, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes entertaining fiction. If you want fact, go pick up a copy of the AMA monthly journal.

Uncompleted at the time of Neruda's death, only 1/3 of the poems in this collection were titled. However, the wisdom and eloquence with which Neruda worked in the last year of his life is without peer in the canon of 20th century poetry. His \\"Finale\\" written on his deathbed to his wife, Matilde, is devastating.<br />Neruda's balance of humor, power, spirituality, compassion and love is so clear in a few of these poems, you may find these poems like little prayers on which you can meditate. For example:<br />If each day falls<br />inside each night,<br />there exists a well<br />where clarity is imprisoned.<br />We need to sit on the rim<br />of the well of darkness<br />and fish for fallen light<br />with patience.<br />Maybe it's just me, but this kind of poetry reads like the wise words of a Buddhist monk high in the mountains of Nepal, man. This collection is the deaf, dope jam.<br />The only criticism I have is with the translation. William O'Daly makes several unusually bland decisions in translating from the original Spanish. For example, Neruda literally writes in We Are Waiting \\"o para asesinarnos de inmediato\\" where the verb \\"assassinate\\" is pretty darn clear. The phrase literally translates \\"or to immediately assassinate us.\\" Given the political tension Neruda was writing under having won the Nobel Prize and having returned to Chile, it is reasonably clear why he used the word \\"assassinate.\\" O'Daly's translation reads: \\"or to instantly murder us\\" opting for the bland general word \\"murder\\" rather than the clear, stronger word \\"assassinate.\\" O'Daly makes similarly odd decisions throughout the text. Fortunately, the original Spanish appears alongside O'Daly's translation so you can read what Neruda actually wrote.<br />Beyond the translation, this is the best poetry collection I have ever read. I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates language being used at its absolute finest. The Sea and The Bells raises the bar for all of us.

Pelecanos works against the straight-jacket of the detective genre to bring us a novel that is equal parts detective novel, social commentary, and roller coast ride entertainment. In the end, it's easiest just to call Right as Rain a detective novel, but it could just as well fit on the literary or mainstream book shelf inside a bookstore. It is that good!<br />One honest word of caution to anyone who may be reading this review trying to make up her mind whether or not to buy or read Right as Rain -- it is a very \\"male\\" novel. It is macho. It is violent and gritty in its depiction of drugs and drug use, and women take subordinate roles to men. If you want great women characters go read Jane Austen, if you want a shotgun and Sharmba Mitchell, Pelecanos is your man.<br />Right as Rain is the story of private detective Derek Strange and former cop Terry Quinn's first meeting and first work together. Quinn has been forced into retirement for shooting and killing a plain-clothed black cop (Chris Wilson) in a morally compromised situation, and the story is primarily about his ability to redeem himself. The race issue is described in multi-textured layers where honesty proves the better line to walk than PC social convention.<br />Both Quinn and Strange have mature issues to work through. For Strange, he must decide how much to commit to a role as father and husband, while working the thankless streets of D.C. And at the center of their work is the lost junkie sister (Sondra Wilson) of the cop Quinn killed. She may hold the answers to why Wilson was going ballistic on a slimeball kid named Ricky Kane, which drew Quinn into pulling his gun in the first place.<br />All of this makes Right as Rain sound like a heavily weighted character novel, and while the characters are heavy the novel itself never gets weighted down. Pelecanos's pacing is about as good as any writer writing today, regardless of genre. You get the sense that he just writes each chapter on the fly, and when done well this makes for the best kind of novel -- one with a pulse, man. One with a very strong pulse.<br />I highly recommend Right as Rain to ...anyone who likes really good fiction. I'd also suggest checking out \\"Shame the Devil,\\" a novel who's opening twenty-five pages may be the best opening twenty-five pages I've ever read. Pelecanos doesn't mince words. When he gets into writing a novel, it's the fiction equivalent of Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali.

Most of us just want a story (plot *or* character driven) and anybody who focuses on making their writing \\"poetic\\" usually gets panned pretty quickly.<br />Faulkner's language in As I Lay Dying is so brilliant as to be dizzying, and it's easy to get lost in the interior monologues of some of the characters.<br />The story -- as most anyone reading this review probably knows -- is told from about a dozen different perspectives each pretty tight at 1-3 pages, and most offering several different chapters to the principle characters. It is different than The Sound and the Fury in that the different perspectives shifts every few pages. It keeps revolving as the story goes along, and the story of a poor-white-trash family carrying their dead matriarch to Jefferson to be buried moves forward through the progression of the novel.<br />Faulkner's tone is both grim and comical but everything takes back seat to the language in what a young Faulkner called his \\"tour de force.\\" It might be worth noting that if a writer today refered to his own work as a \\"tour de force\\" he would be way-laid by reviewers and readers.... Yet, Faulkner is now considered one of the most important writers in American history and As I Lay Dying one of his best novels.<br />I ain't no Faulkner specialist but I'd have to say if you *wanted* to start with a Faulkner novel, As I Lay Dying is just about as good a place as any to begin. At roughly 260 pages, it's a pretty quick read. I'd like to offer one suggestion though if you are gonna read this: every now and again, ...read parts of it out loud. It might give you a better idea of the kind of cadence, meter, and rhythm with which Faulkner seems focused in this novel.<br />Stacey	2003-03-12

It's not a novel to take lightly; nor is it a novel to take too seriously. It is worth realizing how influential this novel was though.<br />You could trace Tolstoy's thinking to Ghandi, who understood (and as a young man corresponded with the elderly Tolstoy) what some people derogatively call Tolstoy's \\"preaching\\" -- and in turn, Ghandi's thought greatly influenced Einstein, who himself wrote a letter to Franklin Roosevelt in 1939 advising Roosevelt how serious a nuclear threat Nazi Germany was to the US and indeed, the rest of the world. Furthermore, Tolstoy's \\"passive resistance to violence\\" had at least an indirect impact on Martin Luther King, Jr., and Tolstoy's \\"philosophy\\" helped to make prescient an ethos from which the great civil rights leader understood that to build a dream of equality, to make it real, one had to resist oppression peacefully. While the roots of Tolstoyian ideology are of Christian origin, Tolstoy helped to \\"make it real\\" at the turn of the 20th century.<br />Anna Karenina *is* a fictional novel, sure, but to treat it as mere fiction would be unwise. In most everything he wrote after Anna Karenina, Tolstoy concerned himself with working out spiritual, social, and philosophical issues; perhaps most importantly today, how a world with so many divergent religions could co-exist. This was made real in Ghandi's thinking, as well as a generation later by Martin Luther King, Jr. Anna Karenina was the last major fictional novel Tolstoy wrote, and the roots of spiritual and philosophical principles that shaped our world today can be seen in its last 200-300 pages.<br />We stand at the brink of a spiritual crisis world-wide today; fanatics have high-jacked religion in an effort to cause destruction, chaos, and fear. Now, more than ever, political leaders, writers, indeed all of us, would be well-advised to take a long look back at the century and a half that got us to where we are today.

I remember saying to my girlfriend about 120 pages in &quot;I think I've found another great one&quot; -- and I meant that I've finally found another contemporary novelist who's intensity level was as focused and whose storytelling power was as solid as just about any other contemporary writer. However, Caesar is *not* a place to start with McCullough. It is too complicated. I'm aware that writing this review will not win any &quot;helpful&quot; votes, but I've got to speak my mind.<br />I thought McCullough's description of Caesar was the best physical and emotional description of a character I've ever read. Her description of his eyes may have been worth the 8 bucks alone. And if I'd have been an early editor, I would have suggested she stay with his character like a bloodhound on a perfumed fugitive. The novel is at its best when her imagination is on and she's just describing a character or a scene or writing dialogue. *That* is when McCullough is without peer.<br />My beef with this book is that she simply tries to do way too much. I got lost when she moved the story back to Rome around pages 150-200 while Caesar was not there. On one page alone I counted 17 different character names, and ultimately this is what did in this novel for me. Way too many characters who just appear for seemingly no reason, and then dissappear. It is just too difficult to follow. Indeed, the initial heft of a 900 page novel isn't exactly a welcome mat into a novel. I imagine those of you who read McCullough will say that it's easy to follow. And fun! And exciting! And I'll not argue that McCullough has the inate ability to tell a story as well as anyone. And *that* is rare.<br />Ultimately, I gave up on this novel at page 277. But it's a strange &quot;giving up.&quot; I think I'll try another McCullough novel in the future. Her storytelling ability is that good. I think she could make the reading world spin on its head if she turned her immense talent to telling a more simple story, and kept one or two characters right in the forefront of each chapter (I'm imagining Alfred Hitchcock taking on the &quot;B&quot;-type movie in Psycho and forever changing the landscape of American cinema). Let the imagination do the work for you, McCullough. Give us a simple story. You're that good! You are! You really, truly are!<br />Staceyead if she turned her immense talent to telling a more simple story, and kept one or two characters right in the forefront of each chapter (I'm imagining Alfred Hitchcock taking on the &quot;B&quot;-type movie in Psycho and forever changing the landscape of American cinema).

Holy smoke! This novel is frightening!<br />Well, so, I *did* read it all the way through this second time, and my personal advice with this novel is just dive on in -- no \\"wetting of feet\\" -- because this novel will scare the pooh out of you, no matter which way you read it. That is the thrill ride that is The Exorcist!<br />On the third night reading this (oh, about February 7, or so) I fell asleep having just gotten through pages 150-216. I woke up three times with nightmares. One of the times, I went to the bathroom, did my business, and I thought I saw something moving in the house. Because of the hazy state of being half-awake, half-asleep, I thought (get this, folks!) it was Regan moving through the house! Oh, holy pooh! This novel is scary! Disturbing! I have never had a novel get inside my head this way! It literally gave me nightmares, man. Fiction!<br />Again, my girlfriend just did not understand why any sane human being would want to experience this kind of thing reading fiction -- and the closest thing I can relate it to, is going through the State Fair's Haunted House when I was a little kid. You choose to be scared, knowing (or hoping) you will make it through to the end! The most disturbing section of the novel *is* that stretch from like pages 150-216, where the demon just goes evil on Regan and Chris. And the final 100+ pages is more affirming, and plot/mystery oriented, building to the novel's famous climax.<br />It's an unusual novel. I would not recommend it to most people I know, on the one hand; on the other, it is the most disturbing novel I have ever read. If you *really* want to be so scared as to lose sleep and have nightmares, then I highly recommend The Exorcist! If you do not like being disturbed, I would recommend just about anything *other than* The Exorcist. Wow!<br />It is so disturbing I'm having trouble finishing this revieres, then I highly recommend The Exorcist!

I carried Lanham's &quot;A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms.&quot; One night my mom and I sat up talking about everything from Picasso to metaphysics and at some point we got to talking about Shakespeare. I tried to explain to her why Shakespeare is rhetorically reveered, and at one point I climbed downstairs to the guest room and retrieved Lanham's book. She -- like most of us -- hears the word &quot;rhetoric&quot; and thinks of politicians and empty promises, or phrasing so complicated as to render simple fact obscure.<br />I think the first word in &quot;Handlist&quot; we got a chuckle over was &quot;chiasmus&quot; and some of the examples like &quot;It's not whether grapenuts are good enough for you, but whether you're good enough for grapenuts!&quot; And the famous &quot;When the going gets tough, the tough get going.&quot; The one that gave her the best chuckle though was an editor's advice to a young writer &quot;You're writing is both original and interesting; unfortunately the part that's original is not interesting and the part that is interesting is not original.&quot;<br />The great thing about this book is that it gives name to a great many devices we already use in everyday speech, and for a writer this information is invaluable. The better facility a writer has with these devices the better he or she can express our endless human emotions.<br />A good many of the examples give the Latin or Greek root word, but the definitions are in English. Many of them have example usage along with the definition.<br />E.g., &quot;Insultatio&quot;: derisive, ironical abuse of a person to his face. As Hamlet says to his mother:<br />Look on this picture, and on this,<br />The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.<br />See what a grace was seated on this brow:<br />Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself...<br />This was your husband.

If you look closely you can see the kind of *heart* that would characterize Steinbeck's humanity in later works. His sensitivity, if you will. But that kind of sensitivity is at its best when balanced with Steinbeck's wit and satirical edge. Here, though, in Cup of Gold was a young Steinbeck without the momentum -- nor the boldness -- to balance a sense of humanity with cutting satire, and the novel ultimately sounds too sentimental and limp. In my opinion, Steinbeck really came into his own with Tortilla Flat (1935). Pastures of Gold (1932) and To a God Unknown (1933) were both closer to Cup of Gold in their romantic tendancies. But Tortilla Flat is the first novel where Steinbeck really enjoyed writing a novel, and the result was a comedy. Cup of Gold provides a window into a young writer's mind (Steinbeck published it at 27) -- a writer trying to find his calling -- and ultimately, a writer who would go on the write better novels with maturity and the development of his craft.	2003-02-03

My girlfriend and I were taking a road trip from Arizona north up to Montana and on over to Yellowstone. It seems like I'd checked it out from the library about a week before the trip and I was about 200 pages along by the time we got to Hurricane. I'll just never forget the image of that book cover on a night stand or dashboard and how each and every night she and I talked about the book -- and how disturbing it was to me.    The story is so well known it has been parodied and sequeled and spoofed in more than a couple places. At its core, The Exorcist is a simple story about a girl, Regan, being possessed by Satan. Her mother Chris, is a working actress, a single mom, and the setting is early 70s New England. Basically, a priest [Demitri Kerras] who's own faith is borderline must summon up the conviction and faith to save the girl.    The story telling is what is so profoundly disturbing, though -- to me. Blatty begins by introducing the fact that something supernatural, something evil is in the MacNeil home. And then he leaves it. He tells Chris and Regan's story. How they are struggling, financially, emotionally, etc., but with each chapter the anticipation (and the fear) is ratcheted up. The themes of religion are not demonized (ironically) and I believe it was Blatty's sincerity, his belief, that makes this all the more horrifying. If he'd have been on a quest to show how screwed up religion is, or how warped fanatics are, this would not have been as effective, as frightening as it is. Blatty's novel approaches a religion-founded horror story from the point-of-view of someone who has a dynamic perspective of religion -- both good and bad -- and the novel really becomes a kind of spiritual quest, where a man's faith, the very thing he believes in (and perhaps the most noble thing *to* believe in) is drawn into question -- to the point of his giving his life.    It is such a twisted tale, so disturbing, that I could not finish it. This is not to say it is ineffective. It was too effective. I think the main reason I wanted to write this review was to kind of wet my feet again with the idea of The Exorcist, in that I want to try reading it again. It is a rare novel. Absolutely horrifying. Shocking. Profound. It will scare the hell out of you.     Stacey Cochran  [[ASIN:B0024NL6QS Author of CLAWS available for 80 cents]]	2003-01-29

I started with Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption because like a lot us I thought the movie was really, really good. King's novella seems driven more on high energy and wit than the calm, cool deliberation with which the film was made, but it was just a lot of fun to see King have fun without bringing in supernatural elements.<br />Likewise, I really enjoyed The Body -- a story about adolescence giving onto adulthood. There were a couple of lapses in the story (like why would the train conductor report Gordie and the gang for crossing the trestle, but the boy *hit* by a train wasn't reported at all), but King's characteristic wit and charm keeps the story more than afloat.<br />The most interesting story to me was The Breathing Method. Nowhere in King's early work does he sustain a nearly flawless, increasing intensity of atmosphere within a story IMHO than in The Breathing Method. There are smaller doses of this ever-intensifying mood quality in a King short story \\"Quitters, Inc.\\" from Night Shift (1978), and the sprawling version of this in The Shining, but this may be the longest version of that tight-ship kind of story where King keeps the story's focus so clearly in mind. On the other hand, some readers might find the point-of-view shift in The Breathing Method too high-falootin' or artsy. Reviews of fiction are so subjective.<br />Apt Pupil was the most disturbing of anything I've ever read of King's fiction. It seemed like he was trying to get his mind around the kind of evil that was Nazi-ism, but King approaches this from a point of view just a little too witty for my particular tastes. I am only one reader, of course, and I have read a couple reviews that really applauded Apt Pupil, so hey, maybe it's worth checking out...<br />All in all, I think reading this collection of four shorter works by Stephen King was time well spent. Furthermore, if you're coming to King for the first time and wanna try a more psychologically suspenseful story, check out The Breathing Method. King builds an anticipation and a fear by making the reader wonder what is *really* going on at the club. I feel like I'm pretty much being incoherent at this point so I'll wrap up this review...<br />God bless and happy reading!

Fascinating. Frightening. Hypnotic. Demonic. Tremendous. Spellbinding. His own bio blurb refers to himself as the \\"world's best selling novelist.\\" One critic has even gone so far as to speculate that Stephen King is our era's Charles Dickens. Anyone who has read King would probably agree he's a writer with a tremendous range, a genius-level vivid imagination, and an understanding of human emotions both simple and yet rarely matched.<br /><br />The Shining is probably his best known novel and of the first twenty or so novels that he wrote, and it seems to me the one he wrote at his happiest. He wrote part of it at the Stanley Hotel near Estes Park, Colorado when he was young enough not to be a commodity and old enough to know what the hell he was doing. Compared to The Dead Zone, Cujo, Pet Semetary, Misery it just seems like a book he enjoyed writing more than any of the other early works. The irony is that The Shining has become synonomous with horror fiction.<br /><br />And that's the way \\"The Shining\\" works on you. Jack Torrance is a flawed man with a drinking problem, a violent temper, but a sense of humor and a genuine love for his wife and child. He's a guy we want to root for! And that's why his descent into madness is so powerful. (and so chilling) To some degree, we all can relate to him.<br /><br />Room 217. The Overlook. Grady. The hedge animals. The isolation. And the shining. All of these devices work so well together in the novel that it's hard not to picture Stephen King writing this thing at points -- a maniacal captain aboard a hotel trip into hell. The guy just gets a kick out'a writing and as simple as that sounds it's actually kind of rare in this world.<br /><br />Enough can't be said of the creative power King exhibits in The Shining. I'm sure scholars have already begun studying the \\"role of Wendy\\" as a modern woman and the \\"psychological trauma of Danny\\" etc. etc., and scholarly work on \\"The Shining\\" will probably continue long after we've all kicked off this earth. That's the world we live in.<br /><br />The novel is not without its flaws. At times, Danny thinks more like a thirty-year-old man writing as a five-year-old boy than a de facto five-year-old boy. At times, The Shining is melodramatic. The character Wendy might have been a more fully realized character. But for a \\"flawed\\" novel, it is -- to me -- the most thoroughly READable flawed novel I've ever read.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Shining\\" to damn near anyone who enjoys reading and, of course, I hope this review is helpful to you.<br /><br />Thanks so much.<br /><br />Stacey Cochran<br />[[ASIN:B0024NL6QS Author of CLAWS available for 80 cents]]ing\\" will probably continue long after we've all kicked off this earth.

And I really, really wanted this novel to work for me. I almost gave up 50 pages in. The opening drowning story was poignant (if dark) and I thought it funny that Naipaul kept referring to Biswas as &quot;Mr. Biswas&quot; even when he was describing him as a little boy. That's the strength of this novel -- Naipaul's sense of humor. But American's are unusually critical of humor -- and I'll be the first to admit it. At times, the humor was just too acidic -- and, at least for my tastes, went from being humorous to being bitter and angry. I gave the Nobel Laureate the benefit of the doubt, and made it through the first 100 pages before finally putting it on the little stand at the front of our house (ready, for the return trip to the library).<br />This novel is important largely because it represents a transitional country. Mr. Biswas's Trinidad is on the verge of 3rd World, pre-colonialization -- and this is evident from just the opening 100 pages. But -- at least for now -- Naipaul's classic just did not work for me.<br />Stacey	2002-10-19

It seems almost absurd that I'd write a \\"review\\" of Anna Karenina. But I will.<br />On the surface, Anna Karenina is a domestic story of three very different couples' relationships. Dolly and Stiva represent the classic functioning dysfunctional upper-middle-class family. Levin and Kitty are the \\"new\\" generation of upper-middle class, and Levin's story is close to Tolstoy's own. Anna and Alexei (and later Vronsky) represent a kind of superstar family, with Anna rebelling against contemporary morality in search of her own fulfillment.<br />I suppose a good question to ask -- to realize -- is how can a domestic novel interest so many readers for so long. That's what is underneath the surface of this 817 page novel. Anna Karenina is a profound spiritual quest, and in the three years that Tolstoy wrote it he time-and-time again tried to perfect his own way of thinking, living, existing. The novel represents one human being's attempt to free himself from all that is negative. Vanity, pride, deceit, infidelity, etc. He struggled to perfect himself -- in the purest sense of the word. And that, is one major reason why this novel is so powerful. It represents one human being's attempts to free himself from all that is negative about being human.<br />Add to this a vivid imagination -- the ability to see a scene, characters, to know them and their surroundings -- and you have a profound and entertaining read. Some of the most interesting passages to me occur when Levin tries to reconcile his spiritual understanding with the practical social issues and arguments of his day, and the last 150 pages are truly one soul's struggling with itself in a contemporary society, where class difference and voting and serfdom are very real issues.<br />Finally, the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation is the best. About three hundred pages in, I checked out another translation (I did this a third time about 700 pages along with yet another translation) to compare the translations, and I realized that Pevear and Volokhonsky have given this novel a brilliance and life like no previous translator. I found their footnotes informative and yet unobtrusive, and I read and reread Richard Pevear's introduction a number of times.

My girlfriend and I found the beach in front of the Sheraton at Ka'anapali to be the best all-aorund beach. We waded out into the calm waters and swam with sea turtles, right there in front of the Sheraton. This handbook explains, though the &quot;little&quot; details like, parking is difficult near the Sheraton so where to park, what the rates are, even shortcuts between buildings and such. This kind of info is just completely impossible to get anywhere else.<br />There are discussions of the personalities of various snorkle tour boat crews -- from adventurous, to laid-back. Some snorkle boats provide lunch, others don't. All this info is in the Moon Handbook.<br />We checked out Haleakala Mountain and Red Hill. With the handbook, we found how to get to Iao Needle. We found which Luau Party was the best for us, etc. Which restaurants to go to. Where to shop in Lahaina. The Sugar Cane Train for an easy-going afternoon. A drive out by the blow-holes on the NW end of the island.<br />I highly recommend this book before going to Maui. If you don't feel like shelling out 20 bucks, another option is always looking into your local library. Most good public libraries carry Moon Handbooks and they're absolutely free. A must before traveling to Maui, the Valley Island! (the 6th edition also includes info on the islands of Lana'i across the Auau Channel and Moloka'i)<br />Happy vacationing!<br />Stacey	2002-10-13

And, if you think about it, how many 70-year-old novels can you say that about? About 110 pages in I thought \\"Damn, this is like Hemingway being entertaining!\\" And what I meant was this: the prose style is as tight, Hammett's imagination as realized and intense, as Hemingway's was (if not moreso) in his \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" which was published just three years earlier. There's not a wasted sentence in \\"The Maltese Falcon.\\" And the cartoonish characters which it was apparently criticized for when it was first published (Spade, Effie Perine, O'Shaughnessy, Cairo, Gutman, and the mysterious Russian Kemidov!) are part of what make this so readable in 2002. They're fun! Goofy, sure -- but fun and vivid and perfectly drawn as any other characters in any other novel I've read from that period. Hammett was reinventing the detective genre and if you are capable of seeing that kind'a thing when you read fiction, you will see it here.<br />I highly recommend \\"The Maltese Falcon.\\"<br />Stacey	2002-10-11

Others on the list that I've gotten 'round to reading include \\"God's Little Acre\\", \\"Valley of the Dolls\\", \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"Jonathan Livingstone Seagull\\", and \\"The Carpetbaggers.\\"<br /><br />Benchley's \\"Jaws\\" is the fastest-read thriller I've ever read. I would now have to rank it with \\"Jurassic Park\\" as one of my two favorite pure-entertainment novels. And I'm sure, over the years I will read it again, and again....<br /><br />But there are enough interspersed thrills to keep this novel rolling. At 275 pages it is (by my slow reading skills) easily readable in a week, and many better readers than me could probably knock it out in a single day.<br /><br />The tone of the novel is darker and more cynical than the movie. Speilberg's film opts for wonder and adventure, whereas Benchley's original is more brooding and angry. And as other reviewers have noted many of the chief scenes in the movie are not in the book. Nonetheless, \\"Jaws\\" the novel does stand on its own. It is a terrific read! Highly entertaining. Complete. And I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a taut, fast-paced thriller.<br /><br />Stacey Cochran<br />[...]	2002-09-24

For 150 pages of Cujo, Donna and Tad Trenton are stuck in a broken-down Pinto at isolated Joe Cambers's farmhouse, eight miles south of Castle Rock, Maine -- while a rabid 200-pound Saint Bernard named Cujo stalks their every move!<br /><br />Cujo is a fast-paced horror story that I came close to returning to the library about 130 pages in. In the first attack scene, King seemed to delight just a little too much in showing this dog with Gary Pervier's shoulder in its mouth, dragging it around the home. This novel is powerful, but its power comes from the building aniticipation that Donna may act heroically -- or might be saved -- in the face of terrible danger. It's the hope that good might happen that made this readable. But when Donna does act -- though heroic -- it ain't really good. It is gruesome. With Cujo, King takes you to hell with an energy that indicates a return -- a glimpse, at least -- to heaven. But that ending does not come. The ending he finished with in Cujo seems cold, rushed, contrived, and low on hope.<br /><br />A major strength of the novel is King's sensitive depiction of Donna's failing marriage to hard-working ad-man Vic Trenton. Vic finds out in the first 130 pages that his wife has cheated on him and that his company is likely to fail. This is aspect of the novel that gave me a sense of reality -- and cause to hope. If I'm gonna read through 150 pages of a dog ravaging people gruesomely, at least give me the hope that the Trenton family can rise above. However, the climax of this novel comes as a result of Vic's returning to Castle Rock to find his wife and son missing, police in his ravaged home, and his decision -- at that point -- to take a nap. A nap!<br /><br />King gets away with this novel because he can always say, well, \\"Hell, it's just a damn horror novel.\\" You know, like what do you expect -- Tolstoy? But it's just that King has the same intense gift that Tolstoy, Twain, Dickens, Poe -- a handful of the best writers in history -- did have. And that one-in-ten-billion talent seems recklessly abused here. Maybe some readers will never be completely satisfied. And maybe others will praise him for his obvious talent and achievement. Cujo is only one novel, and it IS a tight read. One sign of truly great writers is that even when at their lowest their still heads-and-shoulders above the rest. Perhaps, I should just ask for more butter on my popcorn and be happy with what the guy wrote.<br /><br />Stacey Cochran<br />[[ASIN:B0024NL6QS Author of CLAWS available for 80 cents]]id have.

He's an English teacher in a small Maine town called Castlerock, and he's one of those guys that more straight-laced teachers tend to dislike as a fellow teacher, but the kind'a guy that the kids really love. He's funny, sincere, sensitive, intelligent -- something of a goof -- but an all-around really great guy. \\"The Dead Zone\\" is a very readable melodrama of his descent into a world where he can see people's future just by touching them. If he touches you and sees that you are gonna die in four days!....he can tell you not to go into work -- because he knows a gunman is gonna open fire on you and your fellow employees!<br /><br />That is his dilemma. And the engaging depth to The Dead Zone is that it becomes a moral dilemma of severe proportions. Because when Johnny touches a state politician and sees that this buffoon of a politician will get elected president and will cause a massive war -- the question becomes: is it better to kill this one person and save the lives of millions, or to let nature take its course and let millions and millions of people die. And of course no one would understand Johnny if he explained that he saw the future and saw that this politician was gonna cause a nuclear holocaust. King builds to this crescendo of a moral nightmare by constantly showing Johhny being torn between living up to his gift and being viewed as a tabloid psychic, a total hokester, and a creapy guy whom people don't even wanna get near. It's the story about living with an abnormal mental gift.<br /><br />One of the more compelling sub-plots involves Johnny's love story with Sarah Hazlett -- a woman herself torn between waiting nearly five years for Johhny to come out of a coma and getting on with her life with the very normal Walt Hazlett. It this respect, The Dead Zone blends the elements of a psychic phenomenon story and a compelling love story.<br /><br />All-in-all this story reads like the perfect synthesis between King's \\"The Shining\\" and \\"Shawshank Redemption.\\" And may well be a great place for folks who wanna read a King novel but don't want the blood n' guts of Cujo, Pet Semetary, Salems' Lot. On the other hand, if you want a real nightmare story The Dead Zone is not the place to start. Now, go ahead, and click that \\"helpful\\" button!

US	50154126	R2I74DRHAJG58D	0395843677	688424819	The Best American Short Stories of the Century (The Best American Series ®)	Books	5	25	28	N	N	A Review	I used to go to the library and read the old annual Best American Short Story collections. There was something almost religious about picking up a copy from 1927 and reading a story by a then unknown kid named Ernest Hemingway in that old type-face, or the Faulkner stories in just about every annual volume during the 1930s. The bios of these writers at the back of the old copies when they were unknown writers was so innocent and naive. Modern critical theory has influenced my perception of so many of these writers, and that is shame.<br /><br />The stories collected in this Best American Short Stories of the Century are taken from the the annual volumes. There are stories representing each decade from the teens to the 90s. There are classics, and there are surprises. My favorite is Ann Beattie's \\"Janus.\\" It is subtle and masterfully written.<br /><br />I've owned this book for two years, and I read it from time-to-time. Some stories I've read four or five times. Some I haven't read at all. And it's a book that it's okay to do that with, I think. The Fitzgerald story \\"Crazy Sunday\\" was something of a nice surprise, and indeed, that kind of surprise seems at the heart of what Updike and Kenison were aiming to realize. How to make a Best of the 20th Century anotholgy exciting, you know? Considering they could only take stories from the annual Best of American Short Story anothologies, they did that well, I think. Martha Gellhorn's \\"Miami--New York\\" was insightful. The John Cheever, Raymond Carver, and Joyce Carol Oates stories are great classics. I enjoyed Donald Barthelme's \\"A City of Churches\\" and Tim O'Brien's \\"The Things They Carried\\" -- stories ranging from the humorous, to the heartrending.<br /><br />If I could make one suggestion regarding Best American Short Stories, it would be this: I think it would be interesting if every few years they allowed a so-called popular writer to read as guest editor. These stories end up representing a kind of intellectual clique. And it would be interesting to see what a guest editor like John Grisham or Stephen King would add to the mix of our nation's collective stories.<br /><br />Stacey Cochran<br />[[ASIN:B0024NL6QS Author of CLAWS available for 80 cents]]eresting to see what a guest editor like John Grisham or Stephen King would add to the mix of our nation's collective stories.

Pevear and Volokhonsky impressed me so much with their translations of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina and Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, that I was very interested to see how they worked with (in my opinion) the third greatest 19th century Russian writer. That alone, should give you an indication of my value (and understanding/lack of understanding) for this kind of literature; that is, Chekhov's stories are not for every reader. My mom read this book and was concerned with why I would read such &quot;bleak, pessimistic&quot; fiction. I see it totally diferent, though. There is an energy and life to Chekhov's prose that offsets the serious themes a good number of these stories realize. It's like Chekhov really wanted to bring joy to the lives of his characters, to his own life, to his fiction, and the style conveys that -- however, there is no doubt Chekhov realized and sympathized with the harsh reality of the Russian people and the lives they lived. I realize most folks that would even be reading this review probably ain't our ordinary beach-readers, you know, so most of this you probably already know. What I can say is: the selection of stories here span Chekhov's whole career, from his humorist early days, to his so-called &quot;Tolstoy&quot; period, to his latter period when he achieved a certain mastery of form. It's cool to see that range of development: from say, an early story like &quot;The Huntsman&quot; to &quot;A Boring Story&quot; to something like &quot;The Lady with the Little Dog.&quot; It's like a time-line of his development through his life, and that alone may be what affected me the most regarding this selection. Each story is followed by the month and year it was completed; for example: April 1894 for &quot;The Student,&quot; which according to Pevear's introduction was Chekhov's personal favorite. You can see how his core values as a human stayed similar, but his pallete became ever-richer and more complex. And if it interests you, you'll see how he changed as a human through his life and writing. Again, the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation is superb, thoughtful, and realized. Well worth the price.	2002-03-10

It was absolutely brilliant. If you have ever wondered what it was like to live in Paris in the early twentieth century, as an emerging artist (what a cool daydream, right?) this is the book for you. All of those tales of Hemingway and Fitzgerald on the French Riviera, the women, the cafes; Richardson captures it here: the life of an artist realizing his potential as an artist -- it is truly amazing. His explanations accompanying each painting, the way they came to fruition, the stories behind the early masterworks, the market (Les Demoiselles [i.e., the 'most studied painting of the 20th Century' Richardson opines, and arguably the first cubist painting, so upset Picasso and unsettled his friends that he kept it virtually hidden for a decade [this was a young Picasso before his artwork {and ego} commanded millions] and it was touching to read and see this side of young Pablo). Sure, recent trends have tended to treat Picasso with great disdain, and while this IS only a biography, it is the most incisive biography into one of the most celebrated creative minds of the twentieth century that I have ever read. Honestly. The biography itself is an intense revelation -- thoroughly, exhaustively researched and written, and a credit to John Richardson as a human being, a researcher, and a biographical author -- an artist in his own right.	2001-02-23
