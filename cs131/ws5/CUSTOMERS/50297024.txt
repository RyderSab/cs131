US	50297024	R2G90M1NQ9PRCQ	0974014001	335710542	Book 1 in the Resurrection Dawn Series: Resurrection Dawn 2014	Books	3	3	3	N	Y	Decent story, heavy on introspection & characterization	Vicki, a Christian woman has a car accident and emerges an amnesiac.  Her husband is murdered the same night as the accident.  Over the course of 25 years she builds a new life as a well-cared for, but rather vain and worldly lady.  One morning she awakens in the middle of the street with her memories \\"flipped.\\"  She suddenly remembers everything that happened up to the accident, but has forgotten the last 25 years.  Emerging as a recommitted Christian, she becomes zealous to discover the details behind her husband's murder, and starts digging in places everyone else wishes would remain paved! <br /> <br />Resurrection Dawn's strengths are characterization and suspense.  Alexander keeps us almost constantly inside Vicki's head.  We occasionally see the inner thoughts of her enemies, and perhaps most intriguing, of her love-interest, Dr. Mark--who may be a friend and a foe!  The author keeps us guessing as to the good doctor's motives.  Pages do turn with some rapidity in this tale. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there is a fuzziness to Resurrection 2014.  I sometimes tired of so much going on with so little plot progress.  Also, while there was suspense, the plot seemed to meander.  Incidences would just happen, after which we are treated to numerous thought-monologues from various characters. <br /> <br />Another big disappointment is that there was little to indicate that this was the beginning of a series.  I actually reached the final page before realizing I would meet a big fat \\"to be continued.\\"  My sense is that this story probably could have rapped up in a single novel. <br /> <br />One final gripe:  Resurrection 2014 is only incidentally about the last days.  this is primarily a crime novel, with a primary character suffering from flipped amnesia.  The end of times elements seem to be thrown into the story needless, detracting from the story's main focus. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  Resurrection 2014 is a decent story, heavy on characterization and thoughtmonologues.  The plot is somewhat cluttered, though full of suspense.  Readers should realize this is the first installment of a series, and that it does not stand alone. <br />	2005-09-18

I worked as an English teacher on the southern half of the Korean penninsula during almost the same exact period he was in the North (1987-1993 for me).  Much of the xenophobic experiences that he attributes to ideology and politics, is rooted a culture that values much that the West does not:  tradition, stability, respect for authority, hierarchical relationships, conformity and consensus.  Of course, the DPRK's strident self-reliant communism, coupled with its constant search for \\"positive strokes\\" from outsiders greatly exacerbated the author's experiences, relative to my own. <br /> <br />It was especially fascinating to read how Harrold and North Koreans digested many of the incidences from that era--the South Korean \\"radical\\" who went illegally to North Korea; the visits to the North by Billy Graham and Rev. Moon; the drama surrounding the 1988 Olympics, and what, if any, role the North might have.  These and other anacdotes had me thumbing through the pages late into several nights--a true testament considering that we have three young children in the house! <br /> <br />Some have complained that Comrades and Strangers is thin on actual information.  However, part of Harrold's thesis is that a foreigner could be intelligent, observant, easy-going, willing to give up many personal liberties, and gain a working knowledge of North Korea's language, culture, history, and political workings, and still--after seven years--come out having barely scratched the surface.  Those who want details might do better reading Bradley Martin's \\"Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader.\\"  However, this diary gives you an insider's feel for the North that Martin cannot match, despite his 800+ pages. <br /> <br />Having praised the content of Harrold's offering, a few minor issues.  The book comes across as a diary that's been organized for publication.  As such, it is occasionally uneven, sometimes a seeming collection of \\"random thoughts,\\" and somewhat overabundant in mundane personal details.  While I enjoyed the work for its personal first-hand information and story-telling, I'm wondering if more revision and editing might have improved this effort.  Another concern--Comrades has a very narrow audience niche.  Those interested in things Korean, and in the particularly intriguing system that permeates the North--as learned and told by an expatriot with limited Korean language skills will likely prove few indeed.   <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  I loved this book--but mostly because I could relate to so much of it.  The writing is anecdotal, very personal, and it covers the enigma of North Korea from the perspective of a British national, employed by an official foreign language organ of the regime.  The mass market appeal for this work may be limited, by I personal thank Michael Harrold for giving me some truly enjoyable and thought-provoking reading.	2005-08-31
US	50297024	RHDWN7RQNOLO1	1412004772	628309068	American Defector	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Amazing, believable stuff that could use editing	I taught English in South Korea for seven years, and so approached this story with great curiosity and anticipation.  American Defector did not disappoint.  The first person description of David's upbringing--the motif from which he sprang (guilt-ridden, narcisist, upper-middle class, second generation from an immigrant family, son of small business owner, UC Berkley student during turbulent anti-authority early 1970s--all this meshed together to explain well why he did what he did.  The bravado our protaganist expressed against his homeland, and the complying, compromising, pro-establishment role he morphed into as he approached middle age, on the other side of the last segment of the iron curtain proved a fascinating and ironic tale. <br /> <br />With three preschool aged children in the house, I seldom read any book in less than a month.  I devoured this in a weekend.  The subject was that interesting, and the writing was indeed vibrant. <br /> <br />So...why only four stars?  Two factors weigh this tale down.  First, the book needed some strong proofreading.  There were several minor typos, missing words, or words in the wrong form.  The errors were not pervasive, but they were noticable, and proved a subtle detraction;.  Secondly, is this a true story?  The author explains his inability to prove who \\"David\\" really was, or even IF he really was.  And, while the story is reasonable and plausible, it was also one I could have come up with.  Someone who was fluent in English and Korean, had some experience on either side of the DMZ, and who had read other accounts of North Korea, could have assembled such a \\"what a defector might have experienced\\" tale.  My guess is that American Defector is, by and large, an actual diary from an actual defector.  However, the lack of certainty does hinder the reader's ability to fully embrace the story. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  American Defector is a fascinating tale of what life might have been like for an American living in North Korea from the 1970s through the 1990s.  The story is vibrant and plausible.  However, the lack of authenticating evidence and the presence of several proofreading errors proved subtle distractions.	2005-07-17
US	50297024	R4FTYAGVXD2KJ	0842384375	341353984	The Last Disciple	Books	4	4	6	N	N	GOOD STORY SHOWING FULFILLMENT OF REVELATION IN 1ST CENTURY	The Last Disciple is a solid story, describing the first-century persecution of Christians as the Great Tribulation of the Book of Revelation. Brouwer earns points for presenting cross-cultural understandings of Jewish and Roman thought and practice. Additionally, many of the characters, such as Vitas, Queen Bernice, Sophia and Maglorious are compelling, gaining our interest and concern. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there is a sloppiness to this volume. The ending is quiet, yet clearly an invitation to read the next book in the series. As Peretti did with Monster, the author gave us too many supporting characters, creating some confusion. There are also episodes of preachiness, such as when a character explains that prophecy can be about the near future, the distant future, or both. He ends up sounding like Hanegraaff must sound when he explicates his theory on his radio show. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, in making the obvious comparison to Left Behind, the Last Disciple rates higher for superior story telling, more in-depth characterization, and for less James Bond-like action scenes. My overall rating for the Left Behind series was three, so Brouwer's first century version gets FOUR. <br /> <br />Concerning theology: By and large, I'm sympathetic to the Left Behind interpretation of Revelation, as a primarily future-oriented prophecy. Nevertheless, as with other prophecies in the Bible, I would not be surprised if certain passages in John's Revelation meant what Hanegraaff suggests to first-century believers. I'm not sure we need a formal debate, as the afterword suggests--but a discussion is useful. <br /> <br />Bottom-line: This is an interesting tale, promoting a rather obscure, and yet thoughtful interpretation of the Christian apocalyptic vision of John's Revelation. The story-telling is more sophisticated than Left Behind, yet somewhat sloppy. Worth reading and buying. <br />	2005-06-14
US	50297024	R2JSB33RX4UV3N	084991180X	723070327	Monster	Books	3	82	96	N	N	Detailed complexity, yet simple "big picture"	I wanted desperately to love this book...as I have all the other Peretti books geared for adults.  Instead, it was likeable.  The tremendously detailed descriptions of setting harken to a writing era long gone--one that I frankly do not enjoy.  The author is a master a description--writing with vibrancy and clarity.  However, like many TV-generation readers, I get a feel for a book's backdrop, and fill in the blanks myself.  Thus, during particularly wordy passages, I found myself skimming through.  <br /> <br />The professional reviewers were correct to fault Monster's overly crowded field of supporting characters.  I read this book in spurts (preschoolers in the house), and found myself occasionally wondering who I was reading about.  This factor was particularly disappointing when the turncoats were revealed.  I had figured for some time that there were bad guys in the mix of rescuers, and frankly did not care much which ones they were--since there were so many to choose from. <br /> <br />The plot could be very simple, or extremely complicated--depending on whether the reader tries to keep all the details clear, or simply concentrates on how the story is flowing.  Either way, there was some disappointment.  The details were overwhelming, but the overarching plot seemed to amount to Beck spending a long time being moved about the woods, while rescuing kept getting thwarted. <br /> <br />Yes, there was a fair amount of tension, there were some twists, some surprises.  However, the most interesting character was Beck--the woman captured by some interesting creatures.  She uses intuitive \\"intercultural\\" communication skills to figure out how to survive and even work her new \\"family.\\" <br /> <br />On Evolution--a saving grace of this work is that Peretti mainly tackled one issue--do mutations work?  Scientists committed to the theory might scoff at the simplistic and perhaps paranoid approach the author seems to take.  Committed Creationists will be disappointed if they were looking for a persuasive tract.  However for the vast majority of readers--myself included--the simple reality that mutations bring drawbacks, rather than improvements, offers a powerful question mark to Darwin's doctrine. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  This is a decent read, but not Peretti's best.  Comparisons to The Oath are apt.  Peretti does better when he tackles spiritual warfare, or faulty Christian practice.  I recommend the two Darkness books and the Visitation, by the same author, instead of Monster.	2005-05-17

Ms. Hart's description of D.C. intrigue, protocol and culture sound informed and ring true. The action, characterization and dialogue are quite good. The key to Left Behind's political series is that it is intended for a Christian audience--or at least to readers who are sympathetic to evangelical spirituality. There is a lot of dialogue in these pages, and much of it will garner \\"amens\\" from the already converted. <br /> <br />Bottom-line: This is intelligent, realistic end-times fiction, with lots of political intrigue, and a direct Christian message. For those with minds open to spiritual discussion, Necessary Evil is an easy recommendation. For those who do not like to be preached at, or who tend to berate anything remotely \\"religious right,\\" save yourself the antacid and avoid this whole series.	2005-04-04

Like many Left Behind series readers, I enjoyed the series, but was glad to see it culminate with Glorious Appearing.  The last few books seem to meander a bit, and I figured the story had run its course.  Then came word of a prequel and sequel.  \\"Oh no, I thought.  Let's leave this series to rest.\\"  Nevertheless, having come so far, I was determined to see the story through. <br /> <br />What a pleasure to read the Rising.  The prequel trilogy may outshine the actual series.  There are fewer players to confuse the plot, and we see much deeper into their thoughts and personalities.  Jenkins (the true novelist of this co-authored series) seems to have learned from complaints that too often the series was all action, with only inch-deep characterization. <br /> <br />Another plus for the rising, is that we see just how easily and realistically an Antichrist personality might be groomed.  Nicolae's development flows right out of modern day corrupt political and business miliues.  The way he gravitates towards evil is believable.  The process and results have been seen repeatedly throughout history's tryannies.  The seductiveness of spirituality without accountability to God or morality played out effectively, and the emptiness of intellectualism sans spirituality also came across clearly. <br /> <br />Congratulations Jenkins for reviving a series that appeared to be a done deal!  Buy, read and enjoy!	2005-03-23
US	50297024	R3JA148PAWIWYW	084994063X	347431435	Flee the Darkness (Millennium Bug Series #1)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Better writing than Left Behind--Too many dated references	Jeffrey's plot and pacing match that of the Left Behind series.  Where he shines is characterization.  I could relate to Daniel, the guy-next-door hero, who stumbles upon eternal truths in through realistic, uncontrived, yet fascinating events.  Likewise, the President's assistant is a compelling modern woman, who manages to be \\"normal\\", feminine, and yet a true heroine.  We grow to like these people, care for them, and thus become engrossed in the story.<br /><br />An odd factor in Jeffrey's writing--and this shows up in the follow-up novel, Dawn's Early Light, is how romance plays into the story.  The love angle builds suspense, takes up a fair amount of pages, and yet ultimately ends up seeming like a factor the author through in because it is supposed to be there.<br /><br />The key distraction for this story--seven years after the initial publication--is that too much of the material is dated.  Basing a novel on Y2K proved a death nail for many novels (check out the reviews of Bob Bridges an Apocalyptic Fable for an example of the merciless ratings such books can receive).  Beyond the Y2K element, several world leaders were mentioned, along with reasonable but ultimately erroneous guesses as to how they might play out historically.  The story is still compelling, but the danger of a plot heavily based on a current news phenomenon is that once the issue passes, the writing loses its ability to attract.<br /><br />Bottom-line:  Read Dawn's Early Light first.  It's written by the same authors and is less dated.  If the writing proves compelling, this story is worth reading.	2005-03-14
US	50297024	R2ZG4RCR11MFR2	0849916097	945663001	By Dawn's Early Light (Millennium Bug Series #2)	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	More depth than Left Behind but frustrating romance angle	Jeffrey's book is primarily an apocalyptic thriller, and on that score earns a 4+.  The action and plot are fast-paced, much like the Left Behind series.  However, the author's characters have much more depth.  Michael and Devorah prove to be compassionate, intelligent, and interesting protaganists.  The love-tension creates added suspense for much of the book.  On the other side, the evil Russian general and his mistress, Alanna, offer the psychological insights that are masterful.  We see inside the mind of grandiose bitterness in the general, and the emotional roller coaster of an amatuer mole with Alanna.  Rich, addictive writing here! <br /> <br />My major complaint with Dawn's Early Light is that the last several chapters proved too long of an anti-climax.  In fact, I sensed how things would pan out even before they did.  Additionally, the tension-building forbidden love between Devorah and Michael proved interesting for awhile, but ultimately became frustrating.  Jeffrey had a purpose for this element of the plot, but he overplayed it. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  This is an excellent novel, well worth reading.  It's almost cheaper to buy it used than to spend gas going to the library to borrow it.	2005-03-14
US	50297024	R27NB3Z86C9AN5	0849943736	830010703	Obsessed	Books	4	9	11	N	Y	Excellent characterization and tempo = the Dekker formula	More and more, I'm seeing Dekker apply his formula to different settings.  The story tracks closely to Thr3e and Blink, as a psychological-suspense thrill ride.  In this case, the author traverses  the very tense generational struggle of Jews who survived the Holocaust, those who barely remember it, and those who never experienced it.  Stephen Friedman fits in the middle, and tries his best to escape burdensome and unsolvable emotions by simply distancing himself from them. <br /> <br />Another strength of Dekker is his ability to bring us into the mind of evil and perversion.  Roth Braun and his father are unrepentent anti-Semites, who glory not in racial purity, but in pure worship of \\"the prince of the air.\\"  I felt the twisted pleasure these butchers take in emotionally toying with their victims, instilling them with hope, then dashing it.  It's a scary thing to understand why psychopaths do what they do.  This author brings us to that uncomfortable place. <br /> <br />In-depth characterization, several surprising but ultimately intelligent twists, and high-speeed pacing are standard fare for Dekker's novels, and these same ingredients saturate Obsessed.  As a stand alone, this might well garner five stars--especially to those new to what I call the Dekker genre.  However, having read nearly all of his previous works, I have noticed with Obsessed the feel of formula.  It is as if he has found a writing equation, and simply is running different scenarios through it.  It works well, but over time becomes somewhat predictable.  I came to the end of Obsessed and was pleased, but not greatly surprised at how the story wrapped up. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  This is great writing, with excellent characterization and tempo.  I only hope Dekker continues to stretch his approach.	2005-02-13

He got an instant audience, but also accepted the constraints of the simplicity, comic-book like action, and straightforward preachiness of Lahaye-Jenkins. <br /> <br />EXCEPT, that he did not abide by those constraints.  Three books and over 900 pages of Odom's story line has been a treat of character-depth, very human emotions and complex grappling, plus episodes of action that seem necessary, rather than contrived to spice up the tale. <br /> <br />In my review of Book Two of this Apocalypse series I granted four-stars with the hope Odom would break out of possible meandering (such as plagued the middle books of the Left Behind series).  Mel did more than free himself--he found his voice.  We are only one week into the Tribulation, and I feel I've read through several lifetimes.  Deep, powerful, realistic stuff!  Bravo! <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  Left Behind: Apocalypse Book Three is the breakaway novel in this series.  Odom will outdo the original series!  A definite buy!	2005-02-05

(Left Behind Political)	Books	4	12	12	N	Y	Dialogue driven & best for already converted-works well!	In the first novel Ms. Hart took a different path then the Left Behind series.  She helped us see into the minds of \\"churched people\\" who did not become Christians, and who remain on earth when all Christians and children disappear.  Additionally, rather than relying on action-oriented plot, the author used dialogue to set up the somewhat complicated setting and plot.    With Book 2, the story reaches a pleasant stride.  We really feel like we're in the White House, and some of the other power places of the world.  We sense the protaganist's struggle with being in the corridors of power, yet relegated to the outer circle.  The tension between playing the game and keeping to a straight and honorable moral compass comes through clearly.    There is action, suspense, and some James Bond-type heroics here, but the series is meant to examine the political angle of the End Times.  By its nature, this focus requires much dialogue.  Ms. Hart's prose are clear, crisp and generally concise.    Bottom-line:  Impeacheable Offense will make or brake this series for you.  If you enjoy politics, enjoy intrigue, and do not mind a fairly steady diet of spiritual overtones, you'll enjoy this series.  Those looking for more direct action or more subtle spirituality will want to stick with Left Behind, the military series, or perhaps some Ted Dekker books.	2005-01-23

This guy is truly amazing.  He's written straight novels, romance thrillers, psychological suspense, and now a fantasy thriller.  He stretches and stretches, yet never becomes distorted, uneven, or sloppy.  I suspect that a generation from now, Dekker's writings will be essential reading for those who wish to study spiritually motivated literature. <br /> <br />Beyond the obvious parallels between Dekker's Great Romance religion of the fantasy world, and Christianity in \\"our world,\\" I caught some subtlities that could prove provocative.  Could the character William, with his strong hatred of Scabs (sinners) represent certain branches of Christianity?  Likewise, does the Scab priest who conflates Scab religion with a compromised Great Romance spirituality represent compromised Christianity?  If so, with what?  Some hot discussion could result from some of the discreet issues in this series. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  This is true literature.  It's fun, fast, deep, layered, and well worth reading and discussing.  This is what Amazon has in mind when it allows us to offer 5-star ratings.	2005-01-02

However, the style, characterization, and even the tempo remained consistent.  Unlike the Left Behind series, The Secret on Ararat is suspense-thriller writing meant to bolster Christian conviction.  \\"We are right!  Science will confirm God's handiwork.  Those who oppose us and God are evil, and will meet their just reward.  We will overcome, be victorious, and ultimately receive great rewards.\\"  The story works for the already-converted.   <br /> <br />Those who read Lahaye's novel hoping for strong suspense, action, and perhaps some subtle spirituality might be only mildly satisfied.  The story-line is almost James Bondish--fun, but a bit fantastical.  Additionally, the spiritual message is not underlying--it is overarching, and quite direct.  This is tolerable stuff for those not put off by religious messages, but some will feel \\"preached at.\\"  The spiritually timid will want to avoid this series in favor of writers like Ted Dekker, Frank Peretti or a series like the Christ Clone Trilogy.  These authors also present religious themes, but do so with more subtlety. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  This is fun, standard suspense-thriller writing for Christians who want fiction that affirms their spirituality.  The religiously curious may enjoy the series as well, but those put off by direct spiritual messages should look elsewhere.	2005-01-02

Abraham offers us fewer plot twists, action-packed roller-coaster chapters, and more character development and \\"reader in the picture\\" action.  The story line and character grow on you, and you become enveloped in the story.  Left Behind, as much as I enjoyed it, sometimes felt more like the plot-sequence was coming out of a fire hydrant. <br /> <br />Some minor complaints--the names Abraham choses are often odd.   His acrostic with the key seven characters was barely clever, and a bit overdrawn.  Additionally, despite the harrowing events that are taken place, the back and forth between action and dialogue-contemplation is a bit too distinct.  The description and discussion need to be blended more smoothly. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  This is a weak four-star novel.  It's somewhat more sophisticated than the Left Behind series, and well worth reading. <br />	2004-12-05

The action and story development are more subtle and sophisticated than the wildly popular Left Behind series, and the characters are much more interesting. Believability is also a big plus with Abraham's work--I can see this stuff happening! In contrast, Left Behind, which I did enjoy, almost feels like and End Times Christian James Bond plot. <br /> <br />The confusion factor is resolved in Book Two. The author introduced us to an almost overwhelming array of characters in the first book, and it became easy to get them mixed up. In Exodus the various subplots become well defined, and the characters take on dimensions that draw us in. I liked many of these people, and felt the tension of their struggles and temptations. <br /> <br />Bottom-line: A sophisticated and believable alternative to Left Behind--a definite buy recommendation.	2004-11-28

On the other hand, the vast array of character vignettes tends to slow down the pacing, and can be confusing after awhile.  Ultimately, compared with Left Behind, it ranks about even--better at depth and mystery, slower at pacing and action sequence.

Bossidy's Execution was one of five books assigned for a seminary leadership course. Yes, churches have come to realize that intelligent management practices are applicable to religious organizations. <br /> <br />The author's basic premise is that the old Leadership vs. Manager dichotomy is a false one. Visionary leaders who are \\"hands off\\" set their organizations up for failure. The tendency of departments is to promote their own agendas and cover their weaknesses. Those who oversee them must know enough about the people and activities under their charge to catch when things are going wrong. Further, true leaders need to be involve themselves in the details enough that they are setting the agenda, rather than allowing components of the organization to set disparate ones. <br /> <br />Proper execution is the current business buzz and trend. Yet, there is validity to the notion that leaders need to direct key details as well as the big vision. <br /> <br />Bottom-line: Execution was clearly geared for the business world. Yet the basic argument that leaders must dream dreams, but also direct the primary details, is important. For us non-business leaders, this may not be an enjoyable read. We overlook the author's warnings at our own peril, however. Bossidy offers us a leadership set of side and rearview mirrors--allowing us to see our blind spots.	2004-11-23

Many have stated this obvious concept before, but this author explains the situation persuasively, and offers practical steps for abandoning scheduling chaos. <br /> <br />The profound insight offered by Next Generation Leaders is that the future is never certain.  Great leaders are able to chart a clear, persuasive course, based on unchanging principles.  Execution must be flexible, but guiding principles are etched in stone.  Again, for some, these are not new ideas.  Yet, the author has presented his solutions clearly, with poignant anecdotes. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  This is a short easy read, offering a few sharp insights into Christian leadership.  It is most suited for younger leaders, and those who have not fed on a steady diet of leadership readings.	2004-11-15

Ironically, The Power of Focus was a reading assignment for a seminary course I took, and the concepts work well in the management of a modest parish, just as I am sure they do in a large multinational corporation.   <br /> <br />While many of the ideas--the danger of busyness, differing leadership styles, and the need for clarity of vision are longstanding concepts, the author brings them together and fleshes them out with fresh, practical and achievable applications. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  Kudos for a broad, yet approachable text surveying modern leadership ideals. <br /> <br />	2004-11-15

This team of authors has hit upon an important concept that goes beyond the business world:  organization's do well for themselves and their workers when they develop leaders from within.  Furthermore, as we climb our organizational ladders, each promotion brings with it a call for what used to be called paradigm shifts.  Should we fail to make these changes in our thinking and practices, relying instead upon previously learned skills and approaches, we hinder our effectiveness. <br /> <br />Much as Adam Smith explained capitalism using a simple frame work and instructive anacedotes, so Charam and his team has laid out a classic \\"build from within\\" model that is practical for large international corporations and for modest parishes. <br /> <br />My one suggestion, should an update be in the works, is that the authors might address the issues that sometimes arise when work colleagues suddenly become supervisor and supervised. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  An excellent explication of in-house leadership building and the necessary thought changes that leadership promotions bring.	2004-11-15
US	50297024	R373AJHCD2P5EK	031024823X	911982168	Courageous Leadership	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Realistic book on Christian leadership for Pastors	Hybels earned the right to write this book by perservering for 30 years, and turning a revolutionary concept--the seeker-sensitive church--into standard practice within evangelicalism.  He offers a breadth of material that will prove most useful to those pastors who have not fed on a steady diet of leadership books.   <br /> <br />Much of the information Hybels offers can be found elsewhere, yet he packages it together in concise and cogent chapters that cover the breadth of religious leadership principles in down to earth prose.  Perhaps the most useful chapter offered more than a dozen \\"pathways\\" to intimacy with God.  Ironically, he suggested that relating with other Christians and being aggressive for Christian causes are two pathways that most would overlook.  Not all Christians are wired to spend hours in solitary contemplation--and God can speak just as intimately to those who excel in activity or in group fellowship. <br /> <br />Equally important--and perhaps particularly disappointing for many readers--is that Hybels offers no magic formulas.  Yes he succeeded in building a unique mega church out of a dream and a handful of people.  Yet, he says money problems develop character and faith, and patience and endurance are the stuff fulfilled dreams are made of. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  Hybels may not knock your socks off, but he offers practical, hard-earned advise on Christian leadership that is broad, insightful, and yet very accessible.  This is a book the author did not have to write--except that he clearly has a heart for pastors and for the church.	2004-11-15

Yes, the cereberal spiritual types can be super heroes--mostly by trusting their God. <br /> <br />Another strength for the Fallen/Eternity Gene series is that the belief that demons might appear as aliens, or as the gods of the B.C. era is played out intelligently.  It was particularly useful for Hughes to show the demons to be limited, uncreative, and often defeated by their own depravity.  Human characters who take their work seriously, but barter their souls foolishly, others who follow the rules--and admonish those who don't--even when the rule-makers are demons (shades of Nazi Germany here), and other such subplots and vignettes made this a stimulating novel. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  Hughes two-part series is intelligent, well-paced, and yet reads comfortably.  I doubt they will get the exposure and sales they deserve, but readers ought to treat themselves to these \\"sleeper gems.\\"  The one pitfall for Eternity Gene is that readers will not be able to fully enjoy it without reading the Fallen first.	2004-10-03

Dekker has lived up to the high expectation he set for himself in this middle part of the Circle Trilogy.  The pages turn quickly as Thomas plays the role of reluctant prophet in one world, and Chief Warrior for the good guys in another.  The spiritual undertones in the novel are layered, thought-provoking, yet nonobtrusive.  Red is a truly amazing blend! <br /> <br />The pages will turn quickly, and you will keep asking \\"What next?\\"  Beware!  I stayed up on far too many nights to be able to steal an hour or two of tantalizing reading.

Having read all of the Left Behind books, and quite a few other Christian apocalyptic novels, Silence struck me as both solid and unique.  Like Left Behind, Jenkins sticks to an action-driven plot, with occasional theological dialogue.  However, with this novel, he gives us great insights into the characters thoughts and feelings.  This stuff could really happen, and probably has in Communist countries of the Cold War era. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  Jenkins picked up the pace with Silenced (vs. Soon), and leaves us hungry for the final installment.

US	50297024	R3R1QFMBAQ6ZRE	044023607X	635629092	The Fourth Reich	Books	2	6	11	N	Y	Implausible premise and no suspense make for weak novel	Adolph Hitler is the anti-Christ.  Fear not, I did not blow the climax of this story.  The author lays this out in the foreword.  He further defends this rather fantastical notion by explaining in the afterword that Hitler-as-anti-Christ is by far the most logical conclusion the Bible offers, followed by Nero as a distant second possiblity.  Frankly, every time I read, \\"Hitler said\\" or \\"Hitler did\\" I cringed.  This pre-announced climax all but ruined the story for me.    A second flaw is Van Kempen's insistance that the pre-Tribulation rapture of the church (the belief that Christians will be \\"snatched away\\" by God, prior to a time of great troubles and judgment upon Earth) is a dangerous pipe dream.  He has two characters travel around America trying to \\"wake up\\" the sleeping church and warn them to get ready.  Even if Van Kempen is right, his answer to \\"So, what do we do?\\" is anti-climatic:  Buy food rations, find a remote shelter, etc.  I went through these preparations every year, when I lived in Miami, prior to hurrican season--it was hardly theologically significant stuff!    Bottom-line:  I was thankful to reach the last page of this novel.  Read the book of Revelation instead.  It is shorter, and has all the same information!	2004-08-15

Davis Bunn writes Christian novels as if they were mass market novels, and now he is writing mass market novesl with spiritual undertones. This talented author brings us the tale of large western corporations, corrupt government officials (OURS and THEIRS), and the tragic but power mix of young love mixed with spirituality and international political intrigue. Ironically, most of this volatile mix with global overtones, takes place on the wrong side of the tracks in North Carolina.  <br />  <br /> The Great Divide brings universal struggle into a 'down-home country' setting. Perhaps that's the meaning of the title: bringing the very real brutality of an Asian tyranny thousands of miles away into our homes, and showing how it effects everyone, and how, on some level, we're all complicent. <br />  <br /> I am thrilled, and look forward to Bunn's sequel, Winner Take All.	2004-07-24

The notion that any visitors from outerspace that may show up, may be demons is not unique.  Many Christians--especially evangelicals--have posited this view for decades.  Robert Don Hughes is the first I have seen to take the view and weave it into an entertaining spiritual sci-fi thriller.  He gives us time travel, a teen from a truly dysfunctional family, the tension of lost love ones (yes, Dorothy ALWAYS wants to go home!), and some very creative approaches as to how demons operate--sort of like most human governments. <br /> <br />At times the interplay between characters, and the inner musings of the protaganist seem a bit stiff.  Nevertheless, this is an intelligent and unique approach to the theory that UFOs are evil supernatural beings. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  This book is well worth the bargain price that used-book vendors are selling it for here.  Buy and enjoy--I did.	2004-07-24
US	50297024	RTN8CV1MQVVNE	0595264549	423703325	Conquest Of Paradise: An End-times Nano-Thriller	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good, maybe great...but also somewhat disjointed	Gillette scores points for appending an original technological notion (molecular-nano-assemblers) to the ancient Christian apocalypse.  He mixes Scriptures, vibrant description, and an almost poetic tone to offer up a truly unique science fiction tale.  The characters develop via a series of vignettes, rather than through the typical combination of story, narration, and &quot;thinking out loud&quot; that most tales employ.  All of this comes together to offer a very different and interesting read.  At the same time, there was a disjointedness to the work, that distracted from the tension and suspense that the basic premise demanded.<br />Conquest of Paradise rises or falls for the reader, based upon the plausibility of scientists being able to build or generate a molecular-sized machine that could replicate itself into pre-programmed material.  The notion is fascinating.  It does seem very probable that the world would reach the brink of either paradise, tyranny, or total destruction if such a project became reality.  The great weakness is this scenario is that fatalism seems to be the only conclusion.  Is there really any way to keep this genie in the bottle?  Perhaps the author intended to raise questions rather than answer them, but I'm not sure what we're suppose to do with his conclusions.<br />Bottom-line:  This work seems important, and offers a unique approach to apocalyptic science fiction.  However, the novel appears to be a rough draft that needs fleshing out.	2004-07-07

I like Odom's characters, action sequences, and the solid level of tension in the storyline.  Goose is a true man's man, and his wife cares deeply, thinks well, but allows her heart to get the best of her at times.  Jenny's complicated character has moved from the background to the frontline.  Amongst this cast, there is someone for every type of reader to identify with.<br />Perhaps most interesting is how the author is able to slip back and forth between male-think and female think.  The Goose storyline is all action, clear-cut decision making, with only short bursts of angst, while the female side is full of inner thoughts and emotional turmoil.  We move back and forth between the two in seemless fashion.<br />The one potential danger in facing Odom's work is that the story is on the verge of either meandering (much as Left Behind began to do towards the middle of the series), or of really taking off.  With all the warnings readers have issued concerning plotline drift, Book Three will either make or break this series.  My Four star rating is a vote of confidence that the author will deliver!	2004-07-01

A child-prophet grows into a young man who believes in God.  He no longer depends on or delights Him, though.  To use the cliche, Caleb has lost his first love.  Throw into this coming of age spiritual quest a Raiders of the Lost Ark set of characters and you have a roller coaster of a tale.  Jewish zealots want to find the Ark of the Covenant so as to force Israel to destroy the Dome of the Rock and rebuild the Temple.  Muslim militants will stop at nothing to destroy the Ark and protect their holy mosque.  These opposing forces, and some secondary interests are drawn to Caleb, who unknowingly holds the key to the Ark's location.  If all this is not enough to keep the pages turning, Dekker throws in a taut, well-nuanced love subplot.  <br />The writing is superior to Blessed Child, as other reviewers have pointed out.  Additionally, Dekker has explained how the presence of God can feel in a unique and powerful way.  As important as sound understanding and belief can be, the author encourages us to seek true relationship with God.  Words like delight, savor, and total love come to mind.  We come to understand that walking with God in the kingdom is the treasure worth abandoning all else for.<br />Bottom-line:  This is top-notch spiritual writing, that challenges readers to an intelligent, yet deeply emotional relationship with God.  Buy, read, discuss, share!	2004-06-06
US	50297024	RIAY86JLB3YQZ	0849943124	955610690	Blessed Child	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Blessed by Blessed Child	Ted Dekker's collaborative work with Bill Bright comes together masterfully here.  Psychology, human nature, money and religion, true innocence, and characters I really cared about weave together into a truly compelling story.  Caleb is a ten year old boy who has grown up in an Ethiopian Orthodox monastery, and is suddenly forced to flee to America, under the care of a badly burned nurse and a Peace Corps worker who has lost his faith in God.  The boy has healing powers, and also some supernatural glimpses into international intrigue.  This combination draws the attention of a corrupt priest, corrupt political operatives, a young genius with muscular dystrophy, and a network reporter who knows how to succeed.<br />This fast-paced, layered thriller garners four-stars only because the ultimate spiritual messages come through speech-making by the characters, rather than through subtle plot developments and carefully placed insights.<br />Bottom-line:  Great stuff, well worth buying, reading, and even meditating on.	2004-05-29

They have sold multiplied millions of novels, and many of them have been read by those not committed to the Christian faith.  On that score, the writing team deserves five stars.<br />On the other hand, most of their success was based on the early novels.  Many reviewers have commented that the last several books in the series seem to have dragged the story along, apparently so that the requisite twelve books could be written.  These arguments are not without some merit.<br />I picked up hope for a dynamic ending with #11 Armaggedon.  The pace picked up, and the activity seemed back on track.  Perhaps I was optimistic, but Armaggedon gave me great hope that the finale would be a glorious 5-stars.<br />Not so.  Glorious Appearing did some things quite well.  We saw into the minds and hearts of characters who had been through so much.  Vindication, relief, joy, the utter ecstasy of being in the presence of Jesus, the sense of rightness and justice as God's various enemies are judged--all these are described effectively and powerfully.  In fact, the great strength and weakness of Glorious Appearing was the powerful description it contained.  Rather than allowing the plot to move the story, with some description to give depth, we were treated to lengthy descriptions, with only occasional, almost incidental, movement in the story line.  In essence, readers were treated to a slide show, rather than a movie.<br />It would have been insightful to have seen into the minds and hearts of the enemies of God.  What was Carpathia thinking as the end came?  What about the false prophet?  How about Satan himself?  True, the focus was on Christian victory.  However, understanding the true horror of having been eternally deceived, would have boosted this conclusion more effectively.<br />Bottom-line:  Glorious Appearing is written for the faithful--the believers.  The authors must have figured that anyone who had come this far was committed.  The most obvious example of this approach is the heavy use of Scripture passage quotations--some of them quite lengthy.  The novel concludes by giving vivid and powerful narration of Jesus and his followers achieving victory and vindication.  In this good vs. evil drama, the enemy receives far less attention.  It's a feel good ending for those who buy into the premise of the series.<br />Should you buy it?  if you've bought the others you might as well.  Otherwise, borrow it from a Christian friend.	2004-05-15

If I'd never read a Ted Dekker novel, I might have given Thunder of Heaven an eager five stars.  It's action-packed, full of true romance, terrorist plots, military machismo, and thought-provoking psychological suspense.  Blend into this marvelous mix some spirituality that is authentic--not canned--not forced--and you have a unique style that I would describe as the Ted Dekker genre.<br />So, why four stars?  I read Thr3e and Black before coming upon this one.  As good as Thunder of Heaven is, it relies more heavily on description than his later ones.  We do get a good feel for the jungle, and for the thoughts going through each of the characters.  However, Dekker seems to allow events to drive the stories more in his later novels.  The description and narration are more nuanced and subtle.  A second factor, is that Dekker uses a plot device in both Thunder of Heaven and Thr3e relating to character identity.  It works well in Thunder of Heaven, but more masterfully in Thr3e.  <br />Bottom-line:  Buy, read, share!  Only Ted Dekker can beat Ted Dekker in this style of writing.  If you must choose only one of the three in the Martyr's series, I would go with Heaven Weeps (#2).  Each does stand alone.  However, the entire series is worth having, as are his more recent works--Thr3e, Black, and soon-to-be-released Red.	2004-05-01

There's a conflicted romance, a paradise that's threatened, the world as we know it facing devestation, an evil drug company tycoon (how appropriate in today's world of hyper-inflated medicine costs?), and a wannabe novelist who becomes a reluctant hero.  The pacing is intense, but deliberate.  The descriptions are incredible--and yet I wanted so much to believe them.  In the midst of all this action, beauty, and suspense, there are deep issues of right, wrong, good, evil, and the true meaning of reality that weave uninstrusively throughout.  This is powerful, wonderful stuff.	2004-04-25

As a pastor, prison chaplain, and Pentecostal, I approached this work with a mixture of skepticism and anticipation.  I looked for signs of true inspiration, and yet was alert for manipulation and opinion-masked-as-revelation.  I read in this &quot;double-minded&quot; manner for fifty pages or so, and then tumbled upon a section that came through to me with such Holy Ghost anointing that I cast aside my doubts and prayed, &quot;Lord, speak to me through this last day revelation!&quot;<br />The passage contained a vision of the pit of hell.  Many have claimed such visions, but never have I read such a frank, heart-wrending description.  Thomas tells of seeing her own beloved mother in that pit!  I was dumbfounded, and humbled.  I saw the broken heart of God, and was awakened to the urgency of the time in which we live.<br />The honesty and pain of this glimpse into hades so gripped me that I shared it this past Sunday three times.  First, with my adult Sunday School class, then with a group of male prisoners, and finally with a group of female inmates.  In each case, as I read of this mother in hell, there were gasps.  Usually, when ministers read from the pulpit, we limit ourselves to a short paragraph.  I read nearly two pages of her book, and was met with silence and amazement.  Each time I read, I felt such an anointing.<br />I dare not rate this book on its style, plot, or any other such &quot;objective&quot; standards.  This book claims to be an account of visions from God.  I believe it is and encourage believers see what God says about heaven, hell, the importance of our witness, and of holy living in these last days.<br />Thank you Choo Thomas for your sacrificial and humble obedience to an extradinarily difficult calling!	2004-04-20

Focusing on the United States, Ness examines how people here might interpret the disappearances and the rise of an evil Antichrist figure.  As the plot progresses, a small band of characters come together.  They realize that the premillenial rapture and coming Great Tribulation are upon them, and that they must do what they can in their positions of political influence to spread the Christian story to as many as possible.<br />I am a Christian with an interest in current affairs and politics, so I had high hopes for this off-shoot of Left Behind.  The book has a decent plot and interesting characters.  However, people seemed to spend a lot of time talking about what was happening.  The pacing was generally sluggish, with short bursts of action, followed by lengthy analayses.<br />The audience for this book appears different from Left Behind.  Ness spends much time exploring the inner struggles of church people who tagged along with believers, but never converted until after the Rapture.  Non-Christians, who have been drawn to Left Behind for its action-oriented and simple explications of the end times, may find it much harder to relate to End of State.<br />Bottom-line:  This is a solid, well-written end times novel, best suited for Christians who have always wondered, &quot;Just how will people react to the Rapture--especially church people who never became true believers?&quot;  Those wishing to introduce non-Christians to End Times ideas would do better to stick with Left Behind, or perhaps Apocalypse Dawn.	2004-03-21

Mel Odom's Apocalypse Dawn does the same for the military.  How will a doubting chaplain grapple with true believers disappearing?  How about young enlisted types?  A veteran first sergeant (the story's protaganist)?  High ranking generals?  Then, of course, the families left back at the base?  All these angles are explored.  Odom throws in the normal crises that plague some military (and civilian) families:  child abuse, alcoholism, sibling rivalry.  Odom packs so much observation into his novel, all while staying true to the military culture.<br />The aspect that seems to lower the ratings on Odom's approach is the heavy use of technical description.  I am not fond of lengthy descriptions of any type.  However, once I became accustomed to it, it did add flavor and depth to the story.<br />Character development was subtle and effective.  Being the adult child of an alcoholic father might be common enough, but Odom helped us understand what was going through Jenny's head as she battled life.  Joey's seemingly silly competition with a brother 12 years his junior looks foolish and selfish at first, but we do come to understand his dilemma.  I could continue, but suffice to say that each character develops well.  Perhaps some readers are looking for unusual tweaks...but Odom is communicating what ordinary people will experience during the end times.<br />Bottom-line:  Odom details with frightening realism how ordinary military people could struggle through something as horrific as the Rapture and Tribulation, and perceive events as life being crazy as usual...only more so.  Odom's done an outstanding job of presenting a plausible end times scenario from an accurate military angle.  Bravo!	2004-02-09
US	50297024	R3S2DZS9H2M4EH	0849943728	822018095	Three	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Intense, psychological-suspense-thriller	Ted Dekker's Thr3e grabbed my attention from page one and had me enthralled throughout the first 250 pages or so.  Kevin is an adult convert to Christianity.  For twenty-three years he lives in the secretive home of his aunt Balinda, under conditions that scar him mentally, and which are revealed gradually and teasingly.  He finally makes his break from her, and in the course of five years he receives a college education, converts to Christianity, and enters seminary.  He becomes the protege of the school's dean, and seems headed for a life of theology and pastoral care.  Suddenly, a mad man named Slater interrupts his life with death threats and demands for a public confession.  His childhood sweetheart, Samantha, who is now in law enforcement, comes to help him.  What follows is a story that is both fast-paced, and yet constantly leaving the reader hungry for more information.<br />Dekker's writing is crisp and engaging.  His characters are real, yet intense.  The plot twists bring suspense, not confusion.  In short, this is dynamic stuff--five star until the end.<br />My one complaint is that the climax comes too quickly and is followed by a lengthy epilogue.  The key revelation was a mind-blower to be sure.  However, after putting the conclusion out, it took Dekker more than twenty-pages to explain how the ending was logical and came together.  It would have been so much more satisfying if he could have found a way to plant the explanations into the build up to the key revelation.  Also, once the ending was fully fleshed out, we are treated to a rather lengthy epilogue that was sweet, but, resulted in the last fifty pages of the story being a combination of footnote and epilogue.<br />Bottom-line:  Thr3e has five-star characterization, suspense, and writing-style.  It's a definite buy-recommendation.  The one weakness is how the book ends.  The climax comes too early, requires too much follow up explantion, and is followed by an overly long epilogue.  As such, it garners a very solid 4 stars.	2004-01-13

I was in the store looking for the Atkin's carb-counter booklet.  I stumbled upon this brightly colored booklet--what a find!  It's colorful, has all the carb counts Atkins does, and more.  It also gives calories and fat counts, nutrition information, and added health tips.  Although not everything advocated in this booklet fits with the Atkins approach (which I'm using) I still found that the book is more useful.  It's more complete, easier to use, easier on the eyes (larger print and clearer fonts), and more up to date, having been published just this year.  Another big plus is that although this book probably contains at least double the information found in Atkins counter, it is still compact.<br />Some minor complaints:  some of the information does seem a bit dated, and the author clearly does not buy into the low-carb diets that many are using his book for.  Also, the cover may drive some people away, because of its gaudiness (the author wearing a crown) and the stereotypical diet claim &quot;America's Best.&quot;  <br />Bottom line:  Once inside this booklet the loudiness dissipates. Knowledge is presented such that the reader can adapt it to Atkins, to traditional low-fat or low-cal approaches, as well as to diabetic and low-sodium diets.  Those who eat out will find plenty of restaurant charts.  This is a Calorie/Fat/Carbohydrate pocket counter on steroids!  Best of all, the price is only about $1 more than the very streamlined alternatives.	2004-01-02

Now, at 6 months, I've lost 30 lbs, and feel better than ever.  It's been over 20 years since I was this light!<br />As for the book itself, it is clear, persuasive, easy to follow, easy to use as a reference (looking up answers to specific questions), and it includes helpful extras, such as recipes and a pocket carb-counter.<br />The diet has always been controversial, but the medical community seems to be turning around to grudging acceptance of the Atkins approach to health.  A recent study (not Atkins-sponsored) confirmed that when two control groups dieted using prepared meals from the same source, one using a traditional low-fat approach, the other using Atkins' low-carb approach + 300 additional calories per day, the Atkins group still lost more weight!<br />Now to the reviews.  I've perused the negative reviews, and in most cases they are an attack on their perceptions of the diet itself, not on Atkins book.  One reviewer even turned his post into a polemic against obese Americans in general.  Silly stuff.  Another asked, &quot;Why does a body need to be in a state of ketosis when others have lost weight without doing so?&quot;  Obviously, the reviewer did not read Atkins' book--he answers this question--ketosis allows your body to naturally burn fat instead of carbohydrates, resulting in a much more efficient operation, and freeing us to consume fats without fear.  Yes, there are other ways to lose fat, but being in ketosis is easier and more efficient.<br />Bottom-line:  If you are looking for a rich, creamy, full-tummy'd approach to weight loss and good health, read the Atkins book for yourself, and give it a try.  Most of the naysayers have not read the book, have not given the diet an intelligent try, and some negative posters here are clueless about how hard it is for most of us busy, office-worker types to lose weight.  <BR>At the risk of sounding corny, the only you have to lose by trying this diet out is fat and pounds.	2003-12-30
US	50297024	RISXMOVBC5XV7	084994371X	964386491	Blink	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Fast, daring and definitely timely	Dekker's plot moves quickly, primarily involving Seth, a genius who can see possible futures, and Mirium, a Saudi princess running from an unwanted arranged marriage that promises troublesome political realignments for the Middle East.  In the midst of the chase, the two discuss the existence of God, Christianity, and the nature of faith.  Are all cultures &quot;different but equal?&quot;  When our notion of human rights clashes with centuries-old traditions, should we interfere?<br />The writing, plot, character development and pacing are execellent.  My one gripe is that extremely important and delicate issues are &quot;solved&quot; in a manner too convenient and direct.  Characters give us the solutions through their dialogue, rather than the storyline allowing us to discover them for ourselves.  Dekker is not overbearing in the messages he delivers, but he is not subtle either.<br />Bottom-line:  Blink is a fast-paced engaging story full of characters that evoke strong feelings.  You almost want to pray for the heroes, and the bad guys remind us that there is evil in the world.  4+ stars for a top-notch story that a little subtlety could have put over the top.	2003-11-29

Gansky's ability to bring us into the mind of Gordon, the wayward mental hospital orderly was masterful--especially for overtly Christian novel.  Also, Ms. Waal's mental struggle was excrutiating and most insightful.  Dr. Stiller's personal struggles with the love of science vs. faith, vs. the love of teaching were on-track.  Those with similar struggles must have resonated with the writing.<br />For all the interesting subplots, Gansky made a bold gambit:  building up the &quot;main plot&quot; intrigue of a growing red spot on the moon, with all its potential political and spiritual implications...only to remind us that in the end, it is people and how we treat them in the midst of life's tragedies and normalities that really matters.  Most readers, however, will feel cheated by the wrap up of the story.  Yes, in most ways it was gratifying.  However, many big questions were raised, only to be dismissed.<br />The bottom line:  It's worth the read if you enjoy characterizations and human insights.  Prophecy buffs and action-oriented readers ought to look elsewhere.  Three stars for a decent but less than Stiller (sorry!) novel.	2003-11-20
US	50297024	R33D31027P5O21	0553803220	665836968	Babylon Rising	Books	5	8	13	N	N	Far superior to the Left Behind Series and Soon	Tim Lahaye chose a winner to co-author Babylon Rising.  Greg Dinallo has added adrenalin, subtlety and clarity to Babylon Rising in ways that outshine both Left Behind, and Jerry Jenkins new SOON series.<br />The main hero is Murphy, a loveable, sincere, driven, and action-prone biblical archeologist.  His wife, Laura, is bright,  supportive, and gifted in her own right.  Additionally, Shari is his brightest student--a protege who brings youth, energy and commitment to the plot.<br />Then there are the anti-heroes:  A college dean who believes anything religious or biblical cannot be academic; Methuselah, a mystery man who keeps supplying Murphy with important artifacts, but who requires him to face deadly tests before each gifting; The Seven, a mystery cabal, who seek certain artifacts, so they can tap into their dark powers and, yes, rule the world.  Finally, there is Talon, a hit man who loves his work, and brings much danger and heartache to Murphy. <br />While the above cast may sound like they will come together in the same chaotic type plot we often found in Left Behind, the authors keep the storyline tight.  I easily kept the characters in their places, and had a good grasp on what they were thinking at all times.<br />Another plus, is that there are some wonderful subplots and tensions here.  Murphy's relationship with a colleague named Isis is so subtle--I really want to know how they end up.  Isis herself seems to change throughout the story--yet we are not completely sure what is happening.<br />Bottom-line:  This is the best of the Left-Behind spin-offs, and ranks near the top with other apocalyptic and supernatural thrillers such as the Fire of Heaven trilogy, the Christ Clone trilogy, and even Frank Peretti's novels.  BUY, READ, SHARE AND DISCUSS!	2003-10-27

He focuses on one man...a religion scholar in a world that has banned religion.  The near future world of SOON has survived a devestating war that was, indeed, spurred on by religious animosities.  The surviving governments decided to ban religious practice in order to squelch these violent impulses.<br />The Paul character has so many intentional parallels to the New Testament Apostle Paul--being struck with blindness on his journey to persecute Christians, then embracing the truth of the Christians.  There are also parallels to John's letters to the seven churches, found in Revelation 2-3.  Jenkins clearly had fun infusing so many characters and types from Scripture.  <br />The major weakness is the lack of character development.  Yes, we know, in a generic sense, what people are feeling--but we do not engage Jenkin's characters on an emotional level.  Paul's conversion is the perfect example.  He resisted, resisted, could not possible believe, and then, over the course of a few days came to see Christianity as truth.  Within a very few weeks, he was an inside leader in the movement.  Surely such dramatic changes would bring powerful emotions and struggles--but we really do not sense much of it.  The changes just happen.<br />Bottom-line:  This is a solid apoclyptic novel--fun for Christians who remember their Bible stories, and engaging enough for anyone.  Action drives the plot.  If you love to identify with characters and get into their heads, this may not be your first choice.	2003-10-08
US	50297024	RSAB5PVOTWWU2	006001203X	183030674	Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Comprehensive, Doable, and healthy	The pros--like so many others, I have lost weight doing Atkins.  I started two months ago and am down 20 lbs.  That may seem nice, or even great--but it is much more.  I am not a chronic dieter.  I don't do fads.  To be honest, I wasn't even doing the basics.  Additionally, I'm not an excerciser.  However, counting carbs is easy.  Starting out with black and white rules (pastries, pasta, and refined grans = bad, proteins, fibers, and most veggies = good) was clear.  I had enough options--even during the 20-carb gram-a-day induction phase to eat hearty and watch myself melt.  Furthermore, Atkins is BALANCED!  There are plenty of vegetables, and as one progresses towards target weight, fruits and unrefined whole grains reenter the dietary picture.  In addition, though many start Atkins without exercise, the book and program stress its importance.  Personally, I'm on the verge of renewing my exercise routine, now that I don't have to stare a mass of fat everytime I sit down on the bike.<br />Caveats:  Atkins has led several friends and coworkers I know to lighter, healthier lives.  However--and Atkins stresses this--those who commit to a low-carb lifestyle MUST drink lots of water.  High-protein, high-fat diets can lead to kidney stones (it happened to a friend of mine).<br />Bottom-line:  For those who are serious about weight-loss, and burning fat, Atkins will work marvelously.  It is comprehensive, and the book can be used as a reference guide (it's easy to look for answers to specific questions).  You will be more successful if you like meats and rich, creamy foods, and can give up on breads, pastas and sugary sweets.	2003-09-07

Some of the complaints that the series has gone too long, and that the authors are just dragging this out to make money, by coming up with continuing little adventures--well they are the very complaints I was feeling during #9 &amp; #10.  However, this edition has won back my enthusiasm.  Chloe's Tribulation journey gains depth and comes across with such reality and clarity, that yes, I imagined myself in the same setting.  Frustration, anticipation, continuing tragedy, and yet swelling hope make this one of the best in the series.  <br />One aspect of the writing that came out strongly is that even at the edge of the ultimate of all wars, family, young love, and even the struggle of raising a pre-school aged child in the midst of tremendous upheaval are so believably presented.  This is drama itself coupled with how daycare gets managed in the midst of MIAs, POWs, wars and rumors of war.<br />Bottom-line:  Armaggedon moves quickly, realistically, and with strong tension.  The groundwork has been laid for a most powerful ending!	2003-07-02

They say there is eros love (physical and erotic), philio love (brotherly and comradre), and agape love (godly and perfect). This is a tale of all levels of love and how they tangle with money, power, and even holy purposes. Dekker's sequel outdoes the original (Heaven's Wager) in its depth, passion and suspense. <br />Occasionally the reader is able to guess at what comes next. Even then, however, the telling of it is compelling! <br />The author's ending is a bit rushed, much like his first in this Martyrs series. However, this time it works well enough, and I come to the end amazed, inspired, and challenged. Upon finishing this work, Christians will not only ask, \\"Have I lost my first love?\\" but also, \\"Have I really ever embraced the fullness of it?\\" Great stuff!	2003-02-05

The protaganist goes from much earned riches, to losing his wife, child and fortune. He faces a series of choices between right and wrong--encouraged to revenge his misfortunes by grasping at \\"well-deserved but ill-gotten gains.\\"<br />The book generally moves along well. There is suspense on many different levels.<br />My one complaint is that events occur a little too smoothly. First, the protaganist (Kent) experiences a series of tragedies that come at him rather quickly. The author does this intentionally, in that the deaths and losses are spiritually orchestrated. Yet, if we are to believe that there are spiritual forces at work constantly, then their activities should seem a little more coincidental--rather than piling so forcifully on one another.<br />When Kent attempts to regain his losses, he again experiences a series outcomes that, on the natural level, prove too easy to believe. Dekker could have tweeked his plot in a few places--created some \\"bumps in the road\\"--and made this a more believable and intriguing tale.<br />An overall suspenseful story with sharp moral and spiritual insights. A few complications in the plot would have risen this to a top-scorer!	2003-01-26

Suspense builds, and the main characters draw me in.  The parallel events of today and 1943 add to the drama and interest.  However, by the middle of the book I had already guessed correctly how the story would end.  Additionally, I kept waiting for the author to do something with the female lieutenant who could see what the others could not.  It never happened.  She just remained frightened and frustrated until her climatic scene at the end.  The writing is crisp, and the characters and storyline offer much potential.  Ultimately, however, this possessed ship coasted to the finish line.	2002-12-31

She writes of her personal spiritual journey--one that was distorted first by her human parents' failings, then by the failings of the spiritual parent that adopted her--the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.  Much of the unkind, callous, spiritually hypocritical treatment she encountered could probably be found in most religious organizations.  People, after all, can be unkind, callous and spiritual hypocritical--especially when they believe themselves to be counted amongst a religious elite.  What makes Wilson's story compelling, is that she belonged to a group that claimed exclusive hold to THE TRUTH.  Anyone outside of the Jehovah's Witness family will be annihilated at Armegeddon, according to this sect.  The author could not just change churches, or even denominations.  The only escape was to leave the organization, and face damnation and the shunning family and friends.  The horror of this option is compounded by the reality that Witnesses tend to have no relationships outside of their religious community, as such are seen as \\"worldly\\" or even satanic.<br />Wilson tells a compelling tale of the dangers of having other gods (be they false deities, money, possessions, or religious institutions) before the Almighty God.  Any sect that claims that it has the exclusive path to the Father, in fact has made itself an idol.  Lord Acton's political statement that power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely applies well here, and Wilson deserves kudos for sharing her obviously painful decades-long experience.	2002-12-22

His audience is the evangelical or fundamentalist Christian who desires to know the background of these other groups, where they stray from mainstream Christianity, and how to engage such people in religious dialogue.  The author accomplishes these goals masterfully.<br />Some have criticized the author's credentials, or his tone, or specific pieces of information he presents.  Having read several of his books, my sense is that his grasp of the subject is exceptional.  His tone is only a problem for those who misunderstand his audience, or misuse his writings.  The reader is not meant to &quot;thrust this book upon a cultist,&quot; as one reviewer experienced.  Rather, the already-committed Christian is expected to study this book, and prayerfully, carefully prepare to &quot;witness&quot; those he encounters.  In other words--it's not written for the cultist--or even the liberal Christian who finds evangelism, or the exclusive claims of Jesus distatesful.<br />Concerning the actual information he presents:  WOW!  He covers so many groups, uses so many primary sources, and backs his conclusions with so many other scholars.  Critics may nip at the edges, but this tome remains a standard in the field of evangelical Christian apologetics.<br />Martin's style is clear, engaging, and persuasive.  He is writing to convince, after all!  Some have suggested that the author's approach is argumentative, or even abrasive.  Readers should understand that the original work is over 30 years old, written at a time when it was okay to say, &quot;I am right and you are wrong, and here is why.&quot;  Younger readers might find such a debate or courtroom style overly direct, but more mature ones will recognize the work as one of a confident writer who knows he has done well.

He develops the characters and their dilemmas so well in the first two sections of the book, that the reader is prepared for some incredibly in-depth suspense, philosophy, even theology, to be intertwined into the ending.  Instead, the final section wraps the story up a little too neatly--and far too quickly.<br />I liked this story--and it is well worth reading.  However, it is a bit uneven in tempo and style.  A wavered between 3+ and 4-, but finally gave it a 4-star rating, because Gansky drew me into the world of these characters, made me care, and managed to raise some intriguing questions.	2002-12-18

Raymond Franz describes the descent of the Jehovah's Witness organization from its origins as a group of earnest Bible students, disatisfied with the smug status quo of religion in their day, to an absolutely corrupt spiritual regime.<br />Raymond Franz was in the ideal place to observe the inner workings of the highests levels of decision-making in Jehovah's Witnesses Watchtower Bible & Tract Society.  His account is detailed, careful, and to non-members of the group, perhaps ultimately unsurprising.  Governing Body members often made quick personnel decisions, without personal knowledge of who they were appointing.  They made doctrinal decisions based on consensus, often with little discussion of Scriptural or historical precedents.  Sometimes principles were applied unevenly.  There were power-struggles--often justified by Scripture in a manner that suited the moment.<br />Most religious adherents would admit that such unpleasantries happen in their religious organizations from time to time.  \\"After all,\\" they might say, \\"we are a broken people struggling to do spiritual work.\\"  However, Jehovah's Witnesses claim to be the only true messengers of God--and that message is composed from the Watchtower Bible & Tract Society.  Adherents place total trust in what is said to be \\"Jehovah's Organization.\\"  Therefore, for a Jehovah's Witness to read that the difficulties, compromises, and personality disorders that plague other religious groups are just as prevelant in their own comes as quite revelation.  The failures are all the more troublesome, in that the religion is authoritarian and hierarchical.<br />This is an important work that will keep open-minded, searching Jehovah's Witness captivated.  Those less familiar with the group may find Franz's work at times dry and tedious.  His tone is that of a very cautious witness baring testimony against those who he loves but is disappointed in.  This is recommended reading for those specifically interested in Jehovah's Witnesses, or those curious about one who has reached the top levels of a religuous group, only to leave it after nearly four decades of service.	2002-12-12

The ancient, yet most relevant question of why bad things happen to good people, and good things to bad takes on eternal dimensions for Jimmy Lordan.  He believes what the Bible says--sees it taking place as the world draws to a close--and yet he cannot reconcile what he knows with his own sense of justice.<br />The story details horrific events, told with coarse language.  The dialogue will prove too rough for many religious readers.  Additionally, some will see this as an overly dark account.  However, there are similarities between this and the story of Job.  Caldwell courageously examines that line between being a thoughtful, intelligent and aware spiritual person, and being one who challenges the character and nature of God.<br />For those willing to wade through the literary &quot;muck and mire&quot; of this book in order to grapple with intriguing spiritual thought, this is a worthwhile read.	2002-12-11

I could not--though my hat goes off to a writer who clearly had fun denouncing so many sacred cows.  <br />The Last Day offered some useful criticism of religious adherents and their sometimes incongruent systems of worship.

I have a fair knowledge of theology, and found the author's explorations fascinating, careful, yet aggressive.<br />The Facade raise many questions, weaves in some romance, and always respects the reader by offering intelligent dialogue and description.<br />Bottom-line:  Read this book!  Be challenged.  And, pray for the publishers to discover this brilliant, engaging writer.	2002-09-07
US	50297024	R3UATP0M7K91RJ	0849911796	723070327	The Visitation	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A great in-house story for church-goers--lots of "ah hahs!"	Frank Peretti has become famous for his spiritual warfare novels.  However, unlike THIS PRESENT DARKNESS, and PIERCING THE DARKNESS, in which evil was found in worldy people, organizations and philosophies, this time he finds evil within the church.  The author uses the anti-hero--a demon-possessed false christ--to highlight the far more dangerous devils--ignorance, self-righteousness, hypocrisy, pride and cruelty--that call themselves members, and even leaders, of the family of God.<br />The writing is well-paced and enjoyable.  Occasionally there seem to be too many subplots brewing, but the confusion does not last too long.  Peretti causes us to smirk at times, but then catches us unaware--tossing out a bombshell insight that forces us to look more closely into the mirror.<br />Though the book is directed towards Christians, anyone who is active in a faith community will find incredible insights in this book.  Those who are more passive about spirituality may mistakenly see The Visitation as a critique of organized religion.  On the contrary, Peretti simply affirms that family life--whether with blood relatives, or with spiritual 'brothers and sisters'--is sometimes difficult and painful.<br />Bottom-line:  This is an incredible read for those who enjoy a good story with spiritual depth, and who are not afraid to confront themselves.	2002-09-04

Why?  He is injected with an extract of Jesus' blood.  Then...something proves terribly wrong, and a heart-wrenching internal struggle begins.  Counter this dynamic with the protaganist's potential romatic interest--a woman who rightly is thrust into the ultimate \\"love/hate\\" dilemma.  Myers combines crisp, driven prose with a cast of characters that are complex without being complicated.  I cared for the people in this story--and sometimes that meant being torn between good people going in contrary directions.  The pages turned quickly, as the author weaves spirituality with a host of psychological, moral and ethical challenges.  Fantastic stuff!	2002-09-02

We already care for them, so [Myers'] already has our interest.  The struggle between Brandon and Sarah (now married) was frustrating, and a bit odd.  Yes, there are parallels in Scripture, and God can move in mysterious ways.  Nevertheless, this part of the story line proved distracting.  Overall, the plot and character development were more complicated, and less crisp than the previous two.  Myers did well, and Fire of Heaven is a worthy recommendation--but it falls a notch from the others in this trilogy.	2002-09-02

How can his true potential be realized--through a well-financed integration of science and open-minded spirituality, or through the primitive, simple faith of his now severely handicapped and distant father?  How does his past mistakes fit into the future, and where will he find his answers?  Does a well-meaning and beautiful young scientist hold answers, danger, or both for him?  An added plus is that the minor characters enhance, rather than distract, from the plot's momentum.  This is suspenseful, sophisticated story-telling that is imaginative and plausible.  Bottom-line:  Threshold is a great read!	2002-09-02
US	50297024	R3DZRRKPRQ6NSP	0965694828	451794091	In His Image (Book One of the Christ Clone Trilogy, 2nd Edition)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Ingenious plot and perspective	Like many end-times fiction works, this story parallels  biblical prophecies, mostly in tune with the interpretations espoused by Hal Lindsey in THE LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH.  Unlike most other works, however, BeauSeigneur weaves a rich, gripping tale, told from the perspective of the confused &quot;man in the middle.&quot;  The protaganist is not an &quot;almost Christian,&quot; who converts as soon as his loved ones disappear.  Rather, he is an intelligent, thoughtful man who struggles through the series, trying to do what is right.  We struggle with him--understanding why he does not immediately &quot;get it.&quot;<br />There are many twists and turns in the plot that keep the suspense level high.  The author creates a true dilemma--stretching all readers--regardless of their current religiosity.  Additionally, there is a sophistication here that many other novels in this genre lack.<br />The bottom line:  read this book!  My hope is that a major publishing house discovers this talented author.	2002-08-28

Those familiar with Christian end-times fiction know how the book has to end. The author exposes evil, applauds righteousness, and mourns the multitudes who are deluded by the most ancient of enemies.<br />While the author does better than most, in this genre, I found the first two books moved at a better pace than number three. This conclusion had slow spots, and occasionally was more obvious in exposing the author's viewpoints, than the previous two had been. <br />In the end, I loved this series and hated to see it end. My sense is that the author felt the same way. I hope BeauSeigneur is discovered by the big publishing houses. Who knows, maybe he will do a similar series on the Tower of Babel?	2002-08-28

Other reviewers have done an excellent job of detailing the outline of the plot, and BeauSeigneur's masterful ability to keep his reader's guessing at who's good, who's bad, and who is going to &quot;win.&quot;  The author  writes with sophistication and urgency.  He weaves some detailed research into the story with great mastery.  <br />What really stands out--especially in this second book in the series--is that BeauSeigneur helps us understand and even sympathize with delusion.  We come to understand how miracles and fulfilled prophecies could be overlooked, dismissed, and most powerful of all--marginalized, while horrific judgements could lead to a united humanity against all that had been thought sacred.	2002-08-28
US	50297024	R1GTH8K37W94NY	0595004261	713908870	Apocalypse South	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Intriguing and imaginative plot--unfortunate style.	The writer takes the many details of end-times biblical prophecy and compresses them into a compelling individual journey.  The story raises intriguing ideas and unique notions that offer much food for thought.  On the other hand, the writing style is heavily descriptive and narrative.  Occasionally, the dialogue improves the plodding pace, but sometimes even it becomes mere speach-making--a device to communicate the author's viewpoint on a particular issue.  At one point the writer describes a character as being a &quot;road scholar.&quot;  My sense is the error was no typo.  The bottom-line is that this tome offers a potentially imaginative plot--but a sophomoric writing style (with apologies to gifted tenth-graders everywhere).	2002-08-26
