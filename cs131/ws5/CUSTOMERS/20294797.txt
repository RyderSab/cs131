US	20294797	REZZ729OQNLJ3	1555178448	898319171	Every Good Gift	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Not a bad read	As a member of the more skeptical faction of a part-member (part LDS) family, I think it's important to try to understand the viewpoints of those members of the family who remain actively involved in the Church. I enjoy reading books about Mormonism, whether fiction or non-fiction. Because I grew up steeped in Mormonism and Mormon culture, it is an integral part of who I am. But balance is important, and when I read about Mormonism, I try to ensure that I get a good dose of material favorable to the Church in addition to things that might not necessarily be so favorable. <br /> <br />This book is far from great literature. Lots of the dialogue is just too cutesy to be real. And many of the situations are as contrived as the many \\"faith-promoting\\" rumors that abound in this culture. Still, it's entertaining and, at 214 pages, it doesn't require a large investment of time. If you decide to read it, you will find yourself rooting for the characters and smiling inwardly when things go their way. <br /> <br />This novel could be described as feel-good literature. I like the way the protagonist (Bishop Bishop) easily navigates both his own Mormon culture and that of the non-Mormons who live around him. I know people like this, and I admire their ability to be at ease in such different circles. One thing that disappointed me, though, was that the author chose to make a couple of completely unfair and unnecessary political jabs toward the end of the book. One of these involves a character who accidentally shoots and kills a California condor, which is a protected species. In an effort to trivialize the importance of what has happened, he makes the following outrageous statements, which came close to ruining the mood of the whole book for me: <br /> <br />\\"In truth, there were many well meaning people who actually believed that the death of a bird was equal in importance to that of a human being, and even more who believed that the loss of a rare bird was an infinitely greater tragedy than aborting an unborn child. California was a state where politicians pandered to that morally crippled way of thinking.\\" <br /> <br />I'm not sure where Davis came up with this connection between the desire to preserve endangered species and support for abortion. In his effort to paint non-religious people as blood-thirsty abortion fiends, he has only managed to make himself look insensitive to the modern plight of mass-extinction, a phenomenon that will detract from the quality of life of human beings in the future by diminishing, little by little, the vast diversity of life with which God has blessed us. Christianity, including Mormonism, places a lot of importance on responsible stewardship of the earth and its living creatures. Indeed, God admonished Adam and Eve and their posterity to \\"replenish the earth\\" in the very first book of the Bible. If Davis is looking to attract people to Mormonism, he should eliminate such ugly and unfair rhetoric from his thought and his writing. <br /> <br />PS If you enjoyed this book and want to read something else along similar lines, I highly recommend Kathryn Kidd's Paradise Vue. Whereas I gave this one three stars, that one easily deserves five.	2005-07-26

If you're interested in history through the eyes of native Americans, you might enjoy it. (This book explores the life of a small band of Blackfoot Indians during the first incursions of white soldiers.) <br /> <br />If you do enjoy the book, I highly recommend Windwalker (1980), a film about a Cheyenne family's run-ins with a small band of Crows. This film is in native languages except for occasional narration in English. It's filled with long silences accompanied by a cold winter in the snowy Wasatch mountains. This gives it a very authentic feel.	2005-07-23

Another reviewer described the enjoyment gained from reading this book as \\"falling in love for the first time all over again.\\" My experience was similar. <br /> <br />This book reminded me very much of the feelings I had after watching the American film Beautiful Girls (1996). First, I was very disappointed to reach the ending of both stories because I wanted it to go on. Second, I was so enchanted with the little girl in each story that it did sort of feel as if I had fallen in love. <br /> <br />The one-armed poet and his oblivious yet brilliant photographer girlfriend, the washed up novelist, their sometimes obnoxious yet somehow always loveable daughter, the film actor forever trapped in film roles he detests and, of course, the protagonist himself make for a memorable cast of characters. The whole thing reminds me a bit of a The World According to Garp or A Prayer for Owen Meany except that I found this story so much more compelling than any John Irving novel I have read. (Please don't be offended, Mr. Irving. The fact is, very few works of fiction grab me in the way this book did. Even other novels by the same author. And, the fact is, I did enjoy Garp and Owen Meany. They were just different reading experiences than this one was.) <br />	2005-04-30

I've read 5-6 Hillerman titles, and I've enjoyed each one. But this one is an especially good one. <br /> <br />If you like Hillerman's books, try The Shaman Sings and others from the Charlie Moon Mystery series by James D. Doss. These books are set in the Ute reservation of southern Colorado and, to my mind, they portray the Utes and Ute culture in a way that is equally realistic and detailed and respectful to what Hillerman does for Navajos. These books celebrate Native cultures in a way that is long overdue. <br /> <br />In addition, there is a series of novels about a Mayan detective in the Cancun area of the Yucatan Peninsula that are a pretty good read. I tried to track down the name of the author with an Amazon search, but I had no luck. I'll add that name and a couple of titles to this review later if I can track it down. <br /> <br />PS I notice that Hillerman has also published several non-fiction titles. If you enjoyed this book and his other fiction, some of these may be worth checking out, as well. I plan to do so. <br />	2005-04-24

This system is anything but better. Because it's so un-intuitive, I found myself constantly having to refer to the table of sounds and spellings at the beginning the book to decipher the correct pronunciation of a word or phrase. <br /> <br />In some cases, the transcriptions are inconsistent in that they don't follow the system described at the front of the book. For example, the spelling sequence 'ow' occurs several times throughout the book but is not in the reference table. Presumably, it represents the sound 'ao' as heard in the English word \\"couch\\", but that's only a guess. It could just as easily refer to the diphthong 'ou' as heard in the English word \\"dough\\". <br /> <br />That said, a book like this is a useful one to have along when traveling in China. It contains a 40-page grammar section with lots of information about how Chinese works. In typical phrasebook fashion, it also contains several sections organized by subject where one can quickly locate specific words or phrases. It also contains a two-way dictionary, the Chinese-English section being ordered by number of strokes in the character so as to allow Chinese speakers to find English translations. <br /> <br />But do get the previous edition if you can get your hands on it! <br />	2005-03-19

Dr. Morris Swadesh, widely known in the field of linguistics for his comparative studies of languages and language families, wrote this book in 1948. But the book is still a useful introduction to Chinese today. Like any teach-yourself style book, however, access to native Chinese speakers is indispensable. The book would be especially useful if one finds one's self in China for an extended period of time with little or no knowledge of the language.    CCfB is built around 17 basic sentences which represent the most basic messages a traveler in a new environment will need to get across. Gradually, more sentences are added. At the back of the book is a small English-Chinese dictionary which can be used to look up new words to plug into the sentences you have learned in order to expand the number of things you can say gradually while ensuring, from the start, that what you learn is grammatically correct Chinese.    In a way, it's unfortunate that the book contains no Chinese characters. On the other hand, an excellent introduction to Chinese characters can be found in a small volume entitled _I Can Read That_ by Julie Mazel Sussman. I recommend that learners begin their study of the characters using that book, which concentrates on simpler characters which are easy to recognize and even to write. Once those characters, which number fewer than 100, have been mastered, the learner will have a better background with which to understand the characters used to write the 17 sentences in Swadesh's book.    Another weakness of Swadesh's book is that he uses his own phonetic system for writing Chinese in English. Though his system is undoubtedly better from a linguistic point of view, Pinyin is so widespread that it's crazy not to just bite the bullet and learn that system.     I have assembled a short supplement to Swadesh's book on my website where the 17 basic sentences and other material from the book are displayed in Chinese characters and Pinyin phonetic transcriptions.The page is unfinished and will be added to over time.

I believe the authors make a very good case for its merits, however. Thanks to this program, the law now has much more effective tools to protect ordinary people from the reckless, greed-crazed megalomaniacs who prey on them. It also gives those trapped in this soul-deadening lifestyle an opportunity to change their lives and make something worthwhile out of them. Apparently thousands of families' lives have been changed for the better as a result.    Politicians and television journalists like Geraldo Rivera thrive on stories like that of protected witness Marion Pruett who murdered his own wife and four other people after having entered WITSEC. Often, though, certain inconvenient details get swept aside. Such as the fact that Pruett would have been released from jail by the time he committed his crimes, anyway, whether he had joined the witness protection program or not. Because his sentence would have run out by then.    None of us like to see dangerous people on the loose, but the simple fact is that you can't keep everyone who has ever committed a crime in jail. Even if there weren't any ethical issues involved, there simply aren't enough resources. Thanks to our unrealistic drug laws, the United States is already the largest per-capita holder of prisoners in the entire world. What a sad commentary on the so-called land of the free and home of the brave.    I recommend this book for the fascinating glimpses it provides of politics both inside and outside the Justice Department. I was irritated to read about how J. Edgar Hoover's solution to organized crime was to simply claim it didn't exist despite the overwhelming evidence that it did. And I was enraged to read about Jeb Bush's lobbying to get a dangerous anti-Castro terrorist an early release from jail in order to drum up votes in Miami's Cuban community for his father's re-election. But I was alsogratified to learn how hard work by Gerald Shur, Howard Safir and hundreds of others has paid off over the years despite attempts by corrupt government officials in America and elsewhere to both exploit and defeat it.    Also interesting was the story of how Shur and several deputy marshals traveled to Nicaragua during the Reagan years to protect the judge and jury of a trial against five soldiers accused of raping and murdering a carload of American nuns. The descriptions of the dangerous and seemingly hopeless conditions judges worked under in that country at that time made me thankful to be a citizen of a country which, while it is not perfect, at least offers its citizens a reasonably safe and reasonably fair environment in which to pursue meaningful lives.    The description of Colombia under the reign of terror of Pablo Escobar and other psychopaths was also frustrating to read. It's only fair to blame those Americans and others who supported Escobar through the purchase of illegal drugs for enabling him to become so powerful and despotic. Nevertheless, those who persist in believing that the best course of action to take against drugs is to simply ban them must surely see that they do just as much to enable the Escobars of yesterday and today than drug users. For, certainly, the price of these drugs is kept artificially very high because of the risks that must be taken to produce and distribute them.    Like all problems, the problem of illegal drugs is not a simple, black and white issue that can be solved by simply resorting to punitive measures. What is needed is innovative thinking such as what has gone toward the establishment and refinement of the witness protection program over the past four decades.	2005-03-14

That doesn't mean you can't express your opinion; you just have to be subtle about it. Vonnegut is better at this in some of his other writing.  <br /> <br />One of the characters is a one-dimensional brute (possibly based on Ernest Hemingway) who treats his wife and son as things and has filled his house with taxedermised animals he has killed. The other characters are similarly simplistic, and the plot is even weaker. In fact, it's difficult to believe that the same person who wrote this play is also the author of such classic literature as Cat's Cradle.	2004-12-14

A long time ago, I read a book of his short stories which were based on indigenous Moroccan myths. The stories were bizarre and hard to fathom, much like what I've encountered of American Indian and other indigenous tales. <br /> <br />When I stumbled across this book (Up Above the World), I recognized the author's name and was curious to see what other kind of writing he had done. It didn't hurt that the back cover touted Bowles as having \\"undoubtedly one of the finest gifts of all men writing in English\\" (St. Louis Dispatch). I was somewhat disappointed, though. The book, a tale of murder in a Central American banana republic, contains some masterful passages, but I felt the plot was rather weak. Still, it was an interesting read.  <br />	2004-12-14

Like much of Vonnegut's writing, it's entertaining as well as thoughtful, and you find yourself moving along through the book quite quickly, not feeling burdened the way you often can with a book.

He committed suicide before that book was published. Much later, the manuscript for The Neon Bible was discovered. <br /> <br />I wasn't wowed by the book or anything, but when I consider the fact that it was written by a fifteen- or sixteen-year old during the 1950s, it strikes me as a pretty amazing piece of work. It astounds me to think that such a young kid had the life's experience necessary to invent and describe the book's characters. <br /> <br />Just to give you an idea, he writes about a gay couple in a small, Southern town without actually coming right out and saying they're gay. The anecdotes he reveals about the couple seem very true to life to me, but I have to say that, as a sixteen year old in 1976, I would have been unable to formulate even a half-way coherent image of a gay man. Even more surprisingly, he pulls it off without casting a dark cloud on the two characters.  <br /> <br />I'm very interested in getting my hands on A Confederacy of Dunces, a book which promises to be an interesting read.	2004-12-14

Sorry.) <br /> <br />In addition, the major gaffs in geography (the Mississipi River flows many miles EAST of Ft. Smith, Arkansas, nowhere near the Arkansas-Oklahoma border) drained the book of any little bit of adventure that may have remained. How much effort would it have taken on the part of the author, the agent, a proof-reader or whoever to fix these problems? <br /> <br />If you're looking for a Western with substance, try The Ox-Bow Incident or The Rabbit Boss. (The former is a pretty quick read, but the latter, a fictional history of four generations of the Washoe Indian tribe of the Lake Tahoe region, will take a substantial investment of your time.)

Books	4	0	0	N	N	not a non-fiction travel book, but still good	I assumed this would be a travel book as so many of his titles are. It is, in a way, but it's fiction. I liked the book quite a lot, particularly the first chapter, entitled Altar Boy (1956), which dealt with clashing views of religion and how some people's, however well meant, can have a debilitating affect on others'. I was struck by how much it reminded me of some Mormon fiction, particularly Levi Peterson's.  <br /> <br />What he means by his 'secret history', by the way, is his considerable appetite for sexual exploits. This activity dominates the book, unfortunately. Don't get me wrong. I have as healthy an appetite for sex as anyone, but I'm not really all that interested in hearing others brag about their own exploits.  <br /> <br />There are worse things, though. It's one thing to read about such things in a novel or a pornographic magazine which one can choose to read or not, but it's worse to have it foisted on you in public in the form of billboard ads such as the infamous Calvin Klein underwear ads of a few years ago. <br /> <br />Anyway, back to the point. The first chapter of this book is, to my mind, a true literary masterpiece. But Theroux is a great travel writer, and the rest is worth reading for the descriptions of places in Africa and India if nothing else. Toward the end of the book, Theroux makes an interesting observation on travel which rang true for me. The story makes a moving tribute to the religion of Islam, as well. <br /> <br />The scene takes place in a hotel room where he and his wife are staying, above a mosque in Madras (Chennai) just before the call to prayer. I include here some additional text to give the quote some context:  <br /> <br />\\"Below us the faithful were gathering. I watched Jenny's intense concentration and admired her reverence. She picked up her camera quickly and fingered and focused. But she did not shoot a picture -- out of respect, I felt. She said nothing, only watched, and I kept looking at her, the way shescrutinized the scene at the mosque. I thought how travel was composed of moments like this: discoveries and reverences separated by great inconvenience. These encounters, taken together, added up to one's experiences of a place -- the inconvenience had to be forgotten and displaced by the epiphany -- like this call to prayer.\\" <br />	2004-12-14

But today, the plot seems very predictable, with bits and pieces falling into place too neatly all along the way. Nothing comes as any real surprise, including the ending. <br /> <br />The book is worth reading, though, for its philosophical dialogue and its interesting look into the minds of true-to-life characters with varying points of view on justice and the law. <br /> <br />As at least one other reviewer has mentioned, the book is hard to put down. And it's a refreshing read because its style is not unduly difficult. <br /> <br />One sign of good literature is when the characters appear so alive that you feel a strong urge to step into the book and shake them to keep them from making fatal mistakes. Young Gerald Tetley was such a character for me. There's no reason he couldn't have stood up to his stupid father. And, if he had, things might have turned out better for everyone. <br /> <br />Warning: THOSE WHO HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK BUT PLAN TO MIGHT WANT TO SKIP THIS NEXT PART!!! <br /> <br />One especially weak point in the plot for me was the idea that the murder victim never really died. That was so obvious that I saw it coming right from the start. <br /> <br />Also, Kinkaid was shot for no discernable reason. The victims of the lynching bought the cattle legally, yet another group shot Kinkaid and coincidentally rushed off in the same direction. What was their motive? The author never offers any clue. <br /> <br />To make the story even more difficult to swallow, the lynching victims happen to come into possession of Kinkaid's gun which has been taken by the shooters. The story treads dangerously close to becoming a banal political statement here in the way that the movie Dead Man Walking was. When every element of the plot is so carefully arranged so as to create the most gruesome case against vigilantism possible, the sheer unbelievability that results makes it harder to take the story seriously. Dead Man Walking was a dismal failure in this respect, but this book was saved by the care and intelligence that went into creating the intricate thought processes of each character and their interactions with each other. <br /> <br />Also, the inclusion of the character Rose Mapen in the book along with that of her husband is not integral to the plot. I was bothered by this at first, but now I see that these characters help to lend the book the feel of a typical Western. <br /> <br />I find it very satisfying how the book hints at the gendre of Western without actually stooping to its bland, commercial level. The last Western I read (_Cherokee Justice_ from the Trailsman series by Jon Sharpe) was a sickening blend of shoot-em-up bang bang and Romance-novel style sex scenes that made me want to wretch. (Anyone that finds the word 'rump' sexually enticing must have a screw loose. Sorry.) <br />	2004-12-14

However, since others have already so eloquently dealt with that aspect of the book, I thought it might be fun to dwell on the sci-fi aspect of the book in my review.<br /><br />Written in 1887, this novel is full of predictions about the year 2000. Bellamy gets a few things right, and he gets a few things wrong. Things have changed so radically since his day that it's fun to discover what a person from that time thought might come about in our time.<br /><br />While airplanes and international phonecalls might have been foreseen, who could have imagined computers that understand human speech or even the Walkman - something that's pretty mundane by today's standards? And who could have possibly imagined such bizarre musical genres as disco, techno and rap? I suspect an equal number of surprises are in store for our descendants 130 years down the road.<br /><br />Bellamy doesn't foresee any of the above. Nor does he mention automobiles or recorded music, two ideas that must surely have been under development already in his time. Instead, he foresees a time when various styles of music will be available 24 hours a day via telephone, all provided by real-live musicians. A time when all the public sidewalks of Boston will have awnings to keep the rain off those who get caught out in the middle of a rainstorm. And, if his predictions about how government will be run in our time are flat out wrong, the resulting situation isn't so far off. After all, the vast majority of Americans and many others around the globe live like the kings and queens that ruled their ancestors.<br /><br />But if a greater number of people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and many other parts of the world still live without adequate food and shelter, it only shows that we still have our work cut out for us. (More so than ever today, I suppose one might have to say.)<br /><br />Bellamy's prose is surprisingly easy to read considering how long ago it was written. The reader does stumble across odd expressions here and there, but it's less strange than one might guess it would be. And the strangeness of the prose is part of what makes the reading interesting.<br /><br />Also, the fact that Bellamy's predictions are so different from what one might guess at first thought suggests some interesting differences in thinking and culture between people living in the same country 100 years apart.<br /><br />Decades of carefully crafted propoganda have convinced most Americans that big government is anathema while big business grows and grows until today a company like Wal-Mart has a virtual stranglehold on major suppliers of many types of goods. I agree with the indictment of big government, but I think it's the 'big' part that's the most dangerous thing, no matter what the organization.<br /><br />In summary, I agree with many who feel there's still something to be gained from what we learn in this book despite the gross failure of communism and the problems, large and small, that plague socialist programs like Canadian and European national health care.<br /><br />Visionaries in the business world and the sciences are constantly working on new models for improving our life.

I agree with the indictment of big government, but I think it's the 'big' part that's the most dangerous thing, no matter what the organization. <br /> <br />In summary, I agree with many who feel there's still something to be gained from what we learn in this book despite the gross failure of communism and the problems, large and small, that plague socialist programs like Canadian and European national health care. <br /> <br />Visionaries in the business world and the sciences are constantly working on new models for improving our life.

But if/when you want additional information, there are notes on the left side of each page showing the source(s) of each grouping of verses, including chapter and verse, to enable comparisons. There are also more extensive notes on each chapter at the end of the book, including comments about why such and such an event or parable was included and what the consensus of the JS was on the various events. <br /> <br />2- An index in the back of the book gives a short description of each of the ancient gospels from which Funk and his colleagues drew the facts and inspiration for their own gospel. Unfortunately, they have neglected a couple of the gospels mentioned in the book, among them Pseudo Mark which, as far as I can tell, refers to a short section of Mark Chapter 16. (see the notes for the Epilogue on page 105) <br /> <br />3- Another short appendix gives a description of the Jesus Seminar: who they are and some details about their Biblical research. This section is very informative and would be useful to those who know little or nothing about the group. I want to give the book to my father as a gift as I think the contains a wealth of information about both the Jesus Seminar and their scholarship in suitable form for those who know little or nothing about them. <br /> <br />4- Yet another appendix gives detailed notes for each chapter of the gospel. These sometimes include quotes from sources like The Gospel of Thomas which can't readily be located by someone who only has a conventional New Testament. <br /> <br />Suggestions: <br /> <br />1- I hope a future edition will contain a small glossary to explain terms like Purity Party which are unfamiliar tofolks like me who are not formally educated in Biblical studies. (I'm guessing this might refer to the Pharisees in the way that the Saducees are often referred to as scribes.) Perhaps such a glossary could cover minor gospels like Pseudo Mark (see above) that aren't deemed comprehensive enough to be discussed in the Ancient Gospels appendix. <br /> <br />2- I would like a better explanation of how the color-based voting works. They describe it as a weighted system, but I would be interested in knowing exactly what this means. If I were doing it, I might assign red beads two points, pink one, grey negative one and black negative two. But I don't know if this would be the best way or, more importantly, how it is, in fact, being done by the JS. <br /> <br />Some comments about specific parts of the text appear below: <br /> <br />The book contains a prologue, twenty-one chapters and an epilogue. The prologue discusses the circumstances surrounding Jesus's birth and childhood. Oddly, the narration here jumps from his birth to various people's comments and opinions about him as a prophet with no warning, and the bulk of the chapter is taken up by these statements. <br /> <br />Even strangeer is the quote from Paul which appears in verse 13 discussing a visit he made to Jerusalem after Jesus's death. I puzzled over this for some time and finally came to the conclusion that Funk and the Jesus Seminar want to remind us that the first writings about Jesus appeared long after his death, and that some were written by people who never even met Jesus. <br /> <br />Another minor criticism I have is that the authors can't seem to decide if they want a modern-day translation or something closer to King James English. In several chapters, they mix tenses in that annoying way that many New Testament passages do. Yet in others, they use very modern colloquial expressions. (It would be interesting to see a foreign-language translation of this book to see how some of these expressionshave been handled in other languages.) <br /> <br />It was interesting to see which parables the Jesus Seminar saw fit to include in their gospel. I wish they would have provided more information in their notes as to why they chose the ones they did and not others. They do provide good information about the miracles and their ideas about the circumstances surrounding each. A similar discussion of the parables would be useful, too. <br /> <br />One reason I love this book is that it presents Jesus' parables in a new context which makes them fresh to my ears. As a result, I'm able to think about them in new ways, freed from the baggage of so many years of Sunday School explanations. I'm willing to disagree and formulate arguments against the points the parables make yet, in the end, I always have to admit that there are just as many arguments in favor of them. This is a testament to the fact that Jesus' parables have just as much value as teaching devices today as they did 2,000 years ago. <br />	2004-10-12

This review assumes that you've either read the book or have decided to forego reading it. If you don't want me to spoil the book for you, don't read this review. Thanks.    After 600+ pages of intricate character and plot development which, one felt, must surely lead to an extravagant conclusion, the novel suddenly grinds to a halt. Maybe that was the point. The crime that was unsolved for so many years was, in the end, unsolveable. But I felt there were so many interesting possibilities for what could have happened between Harriet and Danny Ratliff or, perhaps, others of the characters that never did. That's probably how a real-life story would turn out, but in fiction, the reader expects some sort of conclusion.    I remember feeling the same way about Tartt's first novel, The Secret History. The attention to detail and the sheer volume of information about each character and the interactions of the characters with each other had me spellbound. Yet, in the end, the characters merely fade away into a drunken and lethargic haze. In fact, both these books remind me of a typical French art film which simply ends when the budget is depleted or the director has had enough either long before or long after the story has come to a reasonable conclusion.    Maybe Tartt should try her hand at non-fiction. Her skills and interests seem to me to be more suited to that. I think she could write an interesting book on the civil rights era of the South, for example. Or perhaps the biography of a famous or infamous person or group.	2004-07-15
US	20294797	R2CRY56414L2S3	0140168125	146741920	Big Sur	Books	1	29	77	N	N	may have some value as an artifact of the era	I stumbled onto _On the Road_ in my high school's library in Fresno in the mid-70s. Even at that time, the book struck me as very dated. I enjoyed reading it because I was very curious about all the places Kerouac had visited. Barely sixteen years old, I had seen very little of my own country, let alone the world. Any information I could get about the outside world was of interest to me, and I spent hours and hours studying the maps and population charts in my father's auto atlas.<br />Years later, I discovered that that obscure book I had read in high school was actually quite a famous one. For years now, I have been meaning to find another copy so that I can read it again and see what my perceptions of the book are now as an adult. Instead, I recently purchased a used copy of _Big Sur_ at a flea market.<br />I know I'm gonna take a lot of flack for this, but I think Kerouac is hugely over-rated. I suppose his work has value as an artifact of Beatnik life in the 50s and early 60s, but I just can't see it being appreciated as especially great by future generations.<br />In my opinion, much of the appeal surrounding Kerouac is based on hype. Something about the stream-of-consciousness style of his writing gives a first impression of profundity that just isn't there upon further reflection. His studied shunning of commas and apostrophes, and his love affair with parenthetical asides (many sentences have two or three with no break between them) (kind of like this) (I wonder how he convinced his publisher to let them stay) add to the obfuscation, making me wonder if he had lawyerly ambitions early in life.<br />Kerouac's own words describe this hype best as this excerpt from the book shows:<br />&quot;But he's got this young kid he brought back from Reno called Ron Blake who is a goodlooking teenager with blond hair who wants to be a sensational new Chet Baker singer and comes on with that tiresome hipster approach that was natural five or ten and even twenty five yearsago but now in 1960 is a pose, in fact I dug him as a con man conning Dave (tho for what, I don't know).&quot; -p 51 in Grafton Books 1986 reprint, paperback<br />Kerouac's character development seems about on par with Fast Times at Ridgemont High. None of the characters have any real depth. And it's hard to take his relationship with Billie seriously because we don't learn enough about her to decide whether we even like her or not.<br />Perhaps the most inane part of the book is the two or three pages he spends expounding the Beat theory that all Americans suffer from a nagging guilt whose source they don't realize is the simple fact that they don't wash their behinds with soap and water after they defecate. I find little of any value to be learned from this supposed insight.<br />The book may have some value for those seeking to gain insight into alcoholism. Then again, his dig at those &quot;ignorant people who don't drink&quot; in the quote below gives me the impression that Kerouac expects everyone to make the effort to understand him and his disease when he hasn't made any effort at all, as far as I can see, to reach outside of himself and understand anyone else:<br />&quot;It's all caught up with me again, I can hear myself again whining 'Why does God torture me?' - But anybody who's never had delirium tremens even in {their} early stages may not understand that it's not so much a physical pain but a mental anguish indescribable to those ignorant people who dont drink and accuse drinkers of irresponsibility.&quot; -p 95<br />Many people who have never touched a drop of drink face problems at least as difficult as those Kerouac had to deal with through no fault of their own. In addition, most of them have to hold down a job and face other responsibilities that care-free Kerouac was able to avoid for the most part.	2004-06-05

As such, it would probably be difficult reading for someone with little background in the field. In fact, I have a wide background in linguistics but not much knowledge of functional grammar, and I found the book difficult to digest, as well. I found I had to re-read certain sections before I was able to completely understand what the author was saying.<br />One thing I really liked about the book was how the author included the actual Greek text (two or three paragraphs only containing ideas upon which much of Rijksbaron's book is based) with an English translation and commented on it extensively. I don't know much Greek, but it was still fun to dig around in the text to try and figure out which words meant what. <br />The philosophy of the ancient Greeks is still alive in lots of humanities courses, but you don't find many references to it in much of what's going on today. It feels good to have this intimate contact with real ideas that Aristotle wrestled with. And it really makes me want to learn the Greek necessary to read this passage.<br />I also enjoyed the linguistic examples which were used to demonstrate the data. For example, the difference between verbs which express an activity which is complete in the moment in which it takes place (the moment I notice something, I have noticed it) and those that don't (I haven't built a house the moment I start or even at the end of the first day). <br />One thing that disappointed me a bit was that Rijksbaron didn't use any examples from his native language or, indeed, from any language but English. I would have been interested in seeing some Dutch linguistic examples through Dutch eyes. <br />Moreover, as good as Rijksbaron's English is, he got some examples dead wrong. So it would have been a good idea to have a native speaker review them before he &quot;immortalized&quot; them in print. (That said, the examples were very good, for the most part, and illustrated the points he was making quite well.)<br />One more observation: As a non-native speaker of English, Rijksbaron should be very careful about how he goes about criticizing other linguists' work. His remarks often came across as abrasive and conceited. Expressing opinions involves all kinds of subtle nuances, and this is where non-native speakers should be especially careful.<br />All in all, though, I enjoyed the book, and I intend to dig into one or two intro-level books on functional grammar in an effort to get a better grasp on the subject, after which I'll give Rijksbaron's book another try.	2004-05-31
US	20294797	R3PBZXQU3I4BHA	0521289491	605982821	Semantics: A Coursebook	Books	5	21	22	N	Y	A Great Teach-Yourself Resource	I stumbled across this book in the English-language stacks at our university library (2001 edition). As an English teacher and a long-time student of several foreign languages, I have a fairly broad background in general linguistics. But before I read this book, I didn't have much background in the field of semantics.<br />Some textbooks don't work so well as teach-yourself references, but this book is well suited to that purpose. At the beginning of each chapter is a pre-test which helps you to be certain you have mastered the items taught in the previous chapter. That pretest is a great tool for checking your progress and ensuring that you understand the concepts being presented.<br />The book teaches you the technical terms you need to know, but the language of the book itself is well suited even to complete laymen. I suppose it would be advisable to tackle a good intro book on linguistics (such as Fromkin &amp; Rodman's An Introduction To Language, an excellent intro textbook which uses humor in an effective way to increase the pleasure of learning, now available in its 6th edition I've just learned) before moving on to this one, but I'm fairly confident that the average reader with no linguistic background at all could probably handle the material in this book with little difficulty.<br />At the end of the book, the authors include a list of useful references for furthering one's knowledge of semantics and pragmatics. I have cursorily examined a few of these, and they seem like very logical next steps.	2004-05-16

John Cusack did a fabulous job capturing the sometimes obsessive, sometimes exasperated but always amusing main character. And the guys who played his store clerks were also fantastic.<br />Then, last summer, I discovered the book while staying in a rundown hostel in Camden, right where the book takes place. I had no idea the original was set in London, and it was fun to read it while wandering the very neighborhoods where it takes place. <br />For me, the different setting made it a lot of fun to read the book after seeing the movie. There were many similarities -- in fact, I could still picture John Cusack in my mind even though he's not British. And I could still picture the guys who played his clerks, too. But the different setting still contributed to my enjoyment of the book. (Although I often enjoy reading a book after having seen the movie, something which isn't always true the other way around.)	2004-04-27

That's generally enough to know if the book will hold my interest while still leaving most of the book unread. If it's a flight of more than 10 hours, I'll usually even take 3-4 books along. Because there's nothing more disappointing that discovering that the book(s) you brought along aren't interesting enough to grab you and relieve you from the tedium of such a long and uncomfortable flight.    Prey is definitely the kind of book I could lose myself in on a long flight. And it has the additional advantage of being a book you can learn something from.    That said, I agree with another reviewer of this book who has observed that the quality of Crichton's writing is much lower in this book than in previous novels.    The science is quite interesting, although I have the sense that I missed a step between how the scientists are able to program simulations of how many small particles interact with each other and the actual creation of the particles themselves. They do discuss this process in the book, but it struck me as somewhat hard to believe.    Also, anything relating to personal relationships in the book comes across as very artificial. The protagonist hardly seems to know his own wife, and his relationship with his former co-workers seems likewise simplistic and unbelievable.    Still, it's a good read. If you can suspend your disbelief concerning a couple of minor issues, you'll enjoy it. It makes for quick and easy reading - just the thing to shorten a long trip.	2004-04-27

I felt this background (the Dutch national character, their attitude toward and interactions with foreigners, the Jewish communities and their attitudes toward each other and toward their Dutch hosts, etc.) added a lot to an already interesting story of intrigue. <br />I have only a basic understanding of futures (as I understand it, 'puts' and 'calls' are, respectively, options to buy or sell a stock you won't actually ever hold at a pre-determined price within a time frame decided upon at the time the put or call is purchased, and that 'options' and 'futures' are just alternative terms for the same thing, the original purpose of such being to iron out wrinkles in the commodities markets which cause hardship on the farmer or other small-scale producer of these goods). I had no idea they were already so well entrenched in the financial markets way back in the 1600s. <br />Even though I have very little interest in business as a way to pursue a living, I find the mechanics of rising and falling prices and how people decide what to buy and what to sell and how this affects the market as a whole to be quite interesting phenomena. This book gave me an interesting look at how this may have worked in earlier times, and it makes me want to learn more about how markets work today.<br />As a novel, the book was also quite successful. I liked how Liss included an occasional chapter from the perspective of a second character. This character's personality and motivations remain somewhat murky until the end, making for an effective way to draw out the intrigue. <br />The only thing I really didn't like about the book was that, in the end, I didn't feel like there had really been any good guys aside from a couple of minor characters. Maybe that's just the way the world was then. God knows most people in our own age have plenty of ulterior motives for most of what they do, but one likes to think (at least I like to think) that most people (including all or most protagonists of novels) have a basic sense of fairness and justice that defines their interactions with other human beings. But maybe that's just a pipe dream.	2004-04-27

My British flatmate lent me this book. When I read the glowing recommendation from author Douglas Adams on the back, I figured it couldn't miss. Yet I have to admit, though I read it cover to cover, I found very little that really grabbed me.<br />Having tramped around London and a few other cities in England, I enjoyed the book for its descriptions of places in Britain and it's interpretation and description of things English from a native's point of view. But I got very little out of it aside from that and a few interesting philosophical tidbits sprinkled here and there throughout the book (see the bottom of this review for a quote).<br />I sort of enjoyed the title story in the way I might enjoy listening to a half-crazy friend tell a story about his loony adventures on holiday, but I found it hard to believe the story would have any wide appeal. I am told that it's Princess Diana in that last scene in the tunnel in Paris, but so what?<br />I also very much enjoyed Back in Ten Minutes, although I found the ending kind of weak. But he did throw in some amusing details like the magazine pictorial of thirty-five feminist vaginas and the questionnaire entitled &quot;How determined are you?&quot; I also loved the typically British non-complainer who comes to pick up his tuxedo for his wedding only to find that the dry cleaner has abandoned his store without bothering to announce it and simply shrugs it off, saying he can just wear jeans or something.<br />Douglas Adams reserved particular praise for the story The Last Woman Killed in the War. &quot;Brilliant tragedy and brilliant comedy delivered in one stunning sentence&quot; he says of the end of that story. That really leaves me scratching my head. In fact, I felt that that could have been one of the better stories if he hadn't ruined itwith that silly, throwaway ending.<br />Nic and Tob was kind of amusing but, again, the ending was pretty silly. I did enjoy the following interesting bit of philosophy from that story, though: <br />&quot;There are few cuisines that are robust enough to travel: Italian, Chinese, French cooking can all be eaten anywhere in the world, can take the substitution of local ingredients and still remain true to themselves; but many others - Austrian, Russian, Spanish for example - simply do not work outside their own borders. There is some connection between the climate and the produce and the way the produce is cooked that breaks down once the cooking goes abroad. The same is true of magic. There are some magics that will work as reliably all over the world as a Zippo lighter - voodoo is not one of them. For voodoo to be consistently effective, it needs to feed on the humid air of the Caribbean, it needs an atmosphere dripping with the quavering thoughts of a million terrified believers, the powders, bones, herbs must soak in the soil where Baron Samedi still watches over the graveyard and the rada drums still echo over the denuded hills.&quot;<br />In closing, I originally checked two stars, but after leafing through the book a bit while putting together this review, I upped that to three stars. Maybe the book wasn't so bad, after all. I would definitely be willing to read something else by the same author in the future. <br />I suppose my main gripe is that the stories themselves didn't seem, for the most part, to have much in the way of a plot. Still, some of the details and character development combined to make it an interesting look at contemporary England.	2004-04-27

I enjoyed this one, though. It sort of reminded me of Nick Hornby's About a Boy in parts, although the two main characters aren't very similar.<br />I gave it three stars because there probably are better books around, but if you happen to find yourself with this one in hand, it's not a bad read. There are some good characters in the book (the Chinese family who run the restaurant, The main character's parents and grandmother, the foreign students at the Churchill Language School, Plum and her obnoxious classmates, etc.)<br />To wrap up, I liked it enough that I was willing to do enough research to track down Man and Boy, another book by the same author. I guess that's a reasonably decent recommendation.	2004-04-27

I wouldn't say I didn't, but I found it very difficult to read. I held out to the bitter end because I sensed that there was something great here, but I must confess that I was very lost for pages at a time at certain points.<br />As most of the other reviewers have mentioned, I was drawn to Golding's other books (this and The Spire) by my experience with The Lord of the Flies. I recognize that this book may be no less of a masterpiece, but it's unfortunate that it is so inaccessible. I believe that worthwhile things are worth the expenditure of time and effort but, unfortunately, the nature of the modern world is that we don't have unlimited resources to spend on every literary work we come across. So, for good or for bad, the more accessible ones usually win out.<br />I do think I'll hold on to the book and give it a try again sometime down the road, but I have to say it wasn't one of my more memorable reading experiences (as Lord of the Flies definitely was many years ago when I was a youth).<br />I'm reading The Spire now, and much of what I have said about The Inheritors above goes for that book, as well. I'm not through with Golding, though. I intend to seek out yet others of his novels to see what else he had to say.	2004-04-25
US	20294797	RYCYGSJZDT2Y2	1888580224	772450448	The Undutchables: An Observation of the Netherlands, Its Culture and Its Inhabitants	Books	1	57	86	N	N	Don't Waste Your Time or Your Money	My problems with this book are many, and they start with the title. Generally a pun has a point. Is there some connection between the Untouchables and the Dutch? If so, it certainly wasn't made evident to me. In like manner, every 10-15 pages, for no clear reason, the authors launch into a \\"presumably poetic phrase packed with powerful alliterative punch.\\" One wonders if they're gearing up to release the next edition all in rhyme. Also, the term \\"Cloggy\\" seems to have been coined in an effort to make Dutch bashing easier. After all, there's nothing like a one- or two-syllable pejorative to help those clever insults to fly off the tongue just like birdsong! Just ask the propoganda artists who invented the terms \\"Kraut,\\" \\"Dego\\", \\"Nigger\\", \\"Raghead\\" and \\"Jap\\" and the nasty jokes to go along with them.<br />Their observations on the Dutch language are completely flawed. Dutch is not a form of German but rather a Germanic language in its own right just like English, Frisian, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. Dubbing it a form of German implies that it has the same general character of German, which isn't true. It's a unique language with its own personality. And it's no more influenced by English and French than any other Western European language.<br />But my main problem with the book is that it seems to be more of an Ameri-centric look at one part of the rest of the world than it is about life in Holland. I am an American who has lived abroad many times and in many countries, so I'm very familiar with the typical complaints Americans have about foreign places. And they're all in here.<br />For example, the authors have a great deal to say about the oddities of Dutch toilets. One can't help but wonder how they failed to notice that no other country has toilets like those in America/Canada or, at least, didn't until very recently.<br />If you are visiting Holland for the first time and you want to actively seek reasons to dislike everything about the place when you get there, then, by all means, buy this book. For every twenty pages or so of mean-spirited Dutch bashing, the authors throw in a paragraph (or maybe only a sentence) grudgingly congratulating the Dutch on some obscure trait or invention. Otherwise, it's pretty much chock full of tedious lists of how you should act to fit in with your wacky/greedy/stupid \\"Cloggy\\" hosts and insults regarding their \\"idiotic\\" birthday song and their inability to behave in orderly ways in public and, of course, their silly activism.<br />If the authors think the Dutch are weird, boy would they find it difficult to live in Kuwait where I, a US citizen, am living and working or, especially, India, where I just spent a three-week vacation!<br />In closing, I think the nice words that the Dutch typically have for this book aren't surprising. What do you do when you've been attacked in so mean-spirited a way? It's pretty much a lose-lose situation. If you complain, you may prove their point in some readers' eyes, but if you don't, people will just assume what they say is true. But, clearly, most Netherlanders have felt that responding in the spirit of good will was the best approach. As the Australians say, Good on them!	2004-03-13
