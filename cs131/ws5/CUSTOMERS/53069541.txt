I thought Fox Woman had promise, but tripped me up in some aspects; this book shows the promise fulfilled.<br />Johnson writes with lyrical grace, as if she has distilled the style and it flows effortlessly.  The story is intensely poignant yet earthy and entertaining, the idea of the fudoki magnificently realized.<br />I really look forward to this author's future work; it's worth buying in hardcover.	2004-02-07
US	53069541	R2RV0C3VM5UNRH	0312869886	670557541	The Apocalypse Door	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Superlative Adventure	When I first saw this book on the shelves and saw that the hero was a monk, and he was teamed with a pretty nun, I put it back.  It's become such a cliche in the last thirty years to throw together people who have a religious calling, have them lose faith (and their brains) before the unsurmountable power of sex.<br />Several friends told me I was dead wrong about this one--that the characters, and the story, are impossible to predict. I am so glad I listened!<br />This is a very well written story, the heroes are intelligent, funny, complex (Peter Crossman is especially complex, as you find out through the snips of his backstory)--and their religion is real.  In these days when bashing Christianity scores easy PC points, this book was particularly refreshing, especially as there was no hint of moralizing or preaching.  Yet the deep, very deep, moral underpinnings are there, glimmering hints of the numinous amid the splendid adventure.<br />If you like action, CIA skulduggery, aliens, supernatural lightning strikes into the mundane world of spies and thugs and heroes and heroines, told with style and humor--there were times I laughed out loud--then try this book.<br />I hope Mr. Macdonald intends to write more.  The ending seemed open enough for Peter Crossman and Maggie, the nun with a gun, to strike once again against evil!	2003-05-03

The story is more coherent than her first, the prose more under control, while still giving the reader little pocket surprises: humor, poetic insights, action, and a really splendid idea in this world leached of all color.<br />Anyone who is tired of the same old medieval fantasies ought to give this novel a try; about all you can predict is that the world will probably regain its color, but how you get there is full of fascinating discursions and distinctive characters. Be prepared to laugh, to nod and contemplate, and to go right back to the beginning for a slow and leisurely reread!	2003-04-01

Nazarian describes DREAMS OF THE COMPASS ROSE as a collage novel; what it really is is a series of short stories, with some of the same characters wandering through.<br />Her style sometimes falters, as if reaching for an effect her skills haven't quite defined, but that's a minor flaw when you compare it to the rich vivid detail of her imagery, the humor, the pathos, the faint trace-elements from mythologies outside the same old Western venue.  There is strong potential here; the sequence from the storyteller's point of view shows evidence of brilliance.<br />Readers who like something strange and new should take a risk on this book, and support an emerging writer who is trying to break the mold.  Go on, take a chance, I dare you to foretell just where this tale is going.  If you shrug and pass, you cannot blame publishers for squashing new voices and putting out yet more bland by-the-numbers product: vote with your wallet.	2002-07-02

It's slow going not because of the writing, which I find skillful and interesting, but because I keep wanting to check facts in Claire's and Mary's letters and journals, as well as in Byron's.  My daughter has been reading it straight, and enjoys it on a different level; it seems amazing that these people, so creative, so interesting, were just her age.<br />Seymour's sympathetic but careful view of Mary Shelley is a refreshing change after the hackjobs and hagiographies of the past century and decades.  Claire's troublesome complexities, and Shelley's selfishness, come sharply into focus as they do when one reads the journals and letters.  In short, kudos to Miranda Seymour for a job well done.	2002-05-20

Once again, Doyle and Macdonald have proven that you cannot predict what is going to happen--even if you think you know one of the events at the end of the timeline of this particular story.<br />General observations: space adventure that is exciting and well written is rare, but these authors manage.  The reader viscerally experiences the mysteries of the eiran and its manipulation, and for a time can perceive how the boundaries of time and space can distort, or even blend.  The prose is stylish, vivid, the action sequences tight, as readers have come to expect from Mageworlds stories.<br />Specific observations: this story brings 'Rekhe back up to the point at which we meet him, or very close.  (More than that one must not say, for a reader could begin with this book, and read them in a different order, looping back to THE PRICE OF THE STARS; the way time flows, it works.  One might get a different perspective on all matters, but isn't that what Jos Metadi tells us in the middle book?)  His motivations become clearer, his choices tougher.  Woven in are the stories of other characters who become equally vivid: there are funny scenes, tense scenes, scary scenes (Kief is seriously scary), scenes of joy, and of pathos.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-04-16

Though it opens with drama and tension, that tension vanishes as soon as the danger does.  The structure here, unfortunately, is a series of very long reports of backstory interwoven with scenes--and with Asaro's trademark delicious physics divertimenti.  It's hard to stay with this one; the internal thrust just isn't there, instead, the reader sticks with it to find out what happens to characters from other books they know and love.  Either Asaro needed to write a whopping big novel so that events could be in realtime, or this should have been two or three books.<br />Fans will want to have it to know what's going on.  New people, do try PRIMARY INVERSION or THE LAST HAWK for a more engrossing, and more linear, introduction to the Skolain empire and its leaders.  This one is not the place to start.	2001-12-03

There are even hints of the numinous in the soul-birds and the fires, etc.  I especially liked the charioteers, the artists.  Crispin and Rustem, Shaksi, the minor military man all came to life.  The political figures, alas, mostly posed while the author lectured us about who they were, how much power they had, and how nuanced they thought, how nuanced they spoke, and how nuanced they acted.  (Did I mention how nuanced everything is in Saratium?  It got so that each new 'nuanced' was like a jab with a needle).  Styliane, in particular, never seemed to move, just stood about and was talked on and on about until she suddenly, and with no motivation, takes Crispin into her bed during a long slew of chapters in which everyone gets laid.<br />I wish Kay had a good editor.  He's capable of doing brilliant work, now that he seems to have the life experience to not just ape Dorothy Dunnett, but he seems to have settled for ponderous plotting, pronuncimienti on life, and lazy prose habits (not just 'nuanced' but on every page he resorts to using 'this' as a noun, while almost never defining it, leaving the reader to mutter, &quot;This what?  This what?  What's this 'this'--is it the same 'this' in the previous paragraph?&quot;)<br />I will keep trying in paperback--there were some wonderful scenes over all--but so far, not quite a keeper for rereadings.	2001-11-15

(David tends to fall into repetitive rants, and the &quot;big insight&quot; segment that goes on for several pages could better have been reduced to one paragraph; as it is the reader keeps muttering, &quot;Right, I get the point already, oh, not ANOTHER iteration...&quot;).  The whole Tacit subplot doesn't work for me--it's so thoroughly unpleasant that it seems forced, but despite all that I kept reading, wanting to reach the end.  Further, I hope David writes another one.	2001-11-03

I sure needed some escapism after the news of the past couple weeks.  The title promised wit.  And the first few pages were pleasant, with just a few tiny errors of useage, but as the book progressed, and Austen's characters became flatter, more distorted, doing things they simply would never have done, it became acutely uncomfortable to read more than a page or two, and I finally gave up.<br />The authors don't really have anything to say, so the story doesn't go anywhere.  They also don't really seem to understand the mental paradigm of the time, much less the niceties of manners.  (And if you're going to write a comedy of manners, then, yes, the little things DO matter.)  Georgiana simply would not have hared off to London alone.  Mrs. Bennet would not have mentioned to strangers, especially strangers perceived at a higher social level, that her sister was in jail.  She might have moaned and acted lachrymose and dropped hints that her life was tragic, but even she would never have gone that far.  And Miss Bingley would never have referred to Kitty and Mary by their first names--thus claiming a familiarity she utterly despised.<br />About all I can attest to in its favor is that at least the authors did not clutter the book up with a lot of Georgette Heyer slang.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am grateful to say, never told Georgiana &quot;Stop making a cake of yourself.&quot;  And Elizabeth Darcy did not, thank heaven, say to her husband, &quot;You're bamming me!&quot;	2001-09-28

They are almost overshadowed by fascinating side characters: Raith, Luke, Ys, and the dangerous Sopronisba.  The story could have used some editing, both in structuring subplots and in excising the occasional regency-romance trite expression (why is brown hair always 'chestnut'?), also in smoothing out the places where the narrative falters in favor of a mini-lecture on history.<br />But those are minor glitches.  The good news is that there are enough threads left dangling to promise a sequel, and perhaps Edgerton will find her stride.  It's certainly worth buying.	2001-07-13

The male POV falters occasionally (&quot;her eyes flashed with magnificent scorn&quot; is an awful romance novel cliche)and some of the arguments resolve as quick as TV sitcoms (in fact, the pacing was rather too much like TV--choppy) and the villain was rather one dimensional. But those don't throw you out of the story.<br />Pros: far outweighing the cons is the fact that Clough attempts an interesting blend of real contemporary life and skiffy &quot;what if?&quot;s.  Edwin's immortality continues in this sequel to be interesting, and Clough doesn't flinch from considering the moral and ethical implications.<br />Also, in these days when it seems all mentions of Christians in fantasy mean &quot;Here comes another fundie bigoted child molestor&quot; or, even worse, the inevitable cartoon Evil Priest in red, an interesting character who happens to be Christian, and who tries to lead a Christian life, is really refreshing.  Clough handles the religious questions with a light hand, permitting the reader to see what being religious is all about, but without preaching.<br />The book is worth buying in hardcover, and keeping for rereads.<br />Looking forward to her next.	2000-10-09

The Republic is the Other in this story, and the  Mages' way of seeing life and the universe is the main focus.  We come to  understand them in this book, which in turn makes rereading the previous  Mageworlds books take on new meaning.<br />The pacing and language is  different, which I think is a plus.  Convoluted, yes.  Complex, yes.  Unexpected, yes.  And wouldn't you like, for once, not to know exactly  where a story is going?

The notes and editing are superb.  But best of all is the glimpse of the writer to come in the writings of this teenager whose eye  for character and motivation is quite astonishing, and whose wit has one  laughing out loud.<br />She reports in detail many of the musical evenings at  her father's home, some attended by famous people both artistic and absurd.  The byplay is wonderful, the glimpses of body language and the turns of  phrase give an almost cinematic glimpse of Fanny Burney's time.<br />See also  her putative courtship (and how the family reacted) when a well-meaning  young man falls head over heels in lust with her, and thinks it's love.  See her unvarnished opnion of the Great Johnson, and ditto the glimpse of  poor Georgianna, Duchess of Devonshire, walking like a sloven through the  Park on the arm of her indifferent spouse, the Duke.<br />This is a must for  anyone at all interested in 18th century life and letters.	2000-04-28

Why are there no photos of Mary Tolstoy O'Brian except at the end of her life?  What ever happened to her daughter?  Who controls O'Brian's considerable estate, given his estrangement from his own family and offspring?<br />King does the best he can.  Perhaps some of his attributions of O'Brian's fictional choices to life incidents are a tad disingenuous, but overall the biography was obviously meticulously researched, and King labors to keep a neutral stance with a prickly subject.  Anyway, it's probably all we're going to get for some time to come.<br />One note of annoyance.  Are there no more copyeditors?  The overuse of 'would' (He would go...he would say...he would do...he would be...she would choose...) grated so much that I kept having to put the book down, wishing for simple verbs.

There, the blend of worldbuilding, character development, social commentary, nifty  science, and romance seemed a perfect balance.<br />I did not enjoy this one  as much, partly because of one of the problems I noticed in some of the  others: the almost claustrophobic focus on personal or sexual relations by  these people who  are supposedly in charge of galaxy-spanning  governments.  When Kelric doesn't make the effort  to hear a crucially important  broadcast, I felt  as if I were reading a romance novel, in which greater  events are totally in a vacuum and all  that matters is the emotional  status of the protagonist.<br />Subsequent thought makes me realize that I  might  be expecting another type of tale than Asaro is  writing.  These are  not really space operas, these  are science fictional romances.  When  viewed so, the lack of political ramifications for all that power, the few  glimpses of the ordinary folk who are ruled by all these brilliantly  beautiful  power symbols, no longer matter.  These are romances, with great  science trappings; Asaro  never disappoints with her nifty physics.<br />The  one other blip on my radar was Kelric's  supposed insight about empaths:  that emotional feeback occurs.  Duh.  Why aren't the high Kyle- rated  offspring taught so obvious a lesson?<br />But that's a minor quibble.  Far  more of interest  was the ambivalence of the Aristos we meet.  In  this  book, there are few of those tiresome  Totally Evial Aristos who spend  pages and pages  torturing hapless protags.  We get fascinating glimpses  into their cultural mindset, into the lacunae of their mental development  and its ramifications, and their own struggles with  their culture.  Hurrah!  I hope there will be lots more of this when the new Jabriol gets  his reign going.<br />Another cause for applause: Kelric's role reversals as  the 'kept man'.  Asaro turned  lots of our own cultural assumptions upside  down in THE LAST HAWK (and without the  strident ranting that makes Sherri  Tepper, for example, so hard to read), and she develops that theme here.upside  down in THE LAST HAWK (and without the  strident ranting that makes Sherri  Tepper, for example, so hard to read), and she develops that theme here.	2000-03-02

But this time,  we really see this universe from the point of view of the &quot;bad  guys&quot;--who aren't necessarily bad.<br />Doyle and Macdonald are never  predictable, or easy; if you like tricky plotting and subtle  characterizations and zippy pacing, this is the book for you.  Add in the  realistic detail on how military people think and work, and you've got  great action as well.  But that's not to say the story is one-dimensional  shoot'em'up; there are insightful glimpses into human interaction, and  traces of mysticism.<br />Well worth the hardback price, because this is a  keeper for years of rereading.

They don't rewrite the same story over and over.  This  novel, about the &quot;second generation,&quot; is witty and fast-paced and  shows bright young people (particularly bright young people who have grown  up in the shadow of very famous parents) to a nicety.  I've read this book  four times, and love it more each time.  I really, really want more about  Jessan, who is my kind of hero!!!	1998-10-17

Turner's style and her complex, fascinating characters make this story a page-turner.  The plot is a tad weak in the second half, but the characters are so compelling one doesn't want to put the book down.  I plan to keep an eye out for this author--and I recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun read that stands out from the dull generic fantasy too common these days. (And don't be put off by the godawful cover art.)	1998-06-21
US	53069541	ROI9XH8A4Q7JD	0312861974	171346278	The Innamorati	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Must Read	This superb fantasy is the best thing I've read all year--and there are lots of good books out.  Snyder's Renaissance Italy is impeccably  presented, with all the humor, beauty, anguish, ugliness, and magic that one finds in reading writers of the time.  The characters are well realized, the story told with wisdom and compassion, and there is--oh joy!--none of the tiresome nineties determinism that seems so requisite in the current Cool Writers.  After listening to me read bits aloud, my spouse (a professor) and my daughter (teenage) are fighting to see who gets it next.	1998-06-21
