I believe that the Harry Potter series was so successfull because it's so good. A good, true to life story combined with a very creative imagination combined with the outmost attention to details. Chocolate frogs that actually jump, Berty Botts' every flavor beans (and that actuaklly means every flavor, including ear wax), food magically appearing on tables, enchanted ceiling that actually shows the sky outside, Quiditch - we may take these things for granted now as just ordinary traits of the wizarding world of Harry Potter, but weren't they deliciously surprising in the first book?<br /><br />While the first book was childish & full of innocence in many ways, the books & their contents grew up along with Harry. But throughout the first 5 books, the world around Harry & friends seem to expand to new emotional levels.<br /><br />But book 6 doesn't seem to be expanding the world of HP - but to start tying all the loose ends together towards the big show off in book 7. While all good things must come to an end (JK Rowling still staunchly claims there will be no more Harry Potter after book 7), this hurts book 6. Harry suddenly grows up quite a lot since the end of book 5 (and remember it's only been a few weeks in Harry's world, not 2 years like in ours!!) and his emotions don't seem to go as deep as they were in the past, as though he can turn the on and off (mostly off) at will, in preperations to becoming \\"the chosen one\\" who will hopefully beat Voldermort.<br /><br />And somehow - even though book 5 was described as being too long & too detailed - I couldn't put it down. I had no problems putting HP 6 down. Yes, I do admit I peeped at the ending, but the suspence of how we got there was sorely missed here.<br /><br />But there is still a lot of good in this book - enough good to make it a worthy read.Even though Voldermort doesn't make an appearance throughout the whole book, the sense of dread and fear is aplaple - whether from stories of people's disappearancesand random arrests to the lack of shock whenever another family of fellow students is hurt or worse...<br /><br />Book 6 is in a very tight spot in the series: not all exposure could be left for book 7, but book 6 is tied down with  lot of it without having the reward of a showoff & proper ending. I KNOW!! I'll buy book 7 ASAP when it comes out, even with all these flaws...	2005-07-30

Nothing is very clear, but apparentlu the US is under military rule, under the Major. Every year, 100 boys go on something which is called the Long Walk. They boys just have to walk from Maine south, at a speed of 4 miles an hour. Anyone walking slower, in the wrong direction, or just happens to stop too long for whatever reason (legitimate as it may be) - gets a warning. After 3 warnings - he dies. If he manages to walk for an hour without being warned again - a warning is taken off. The last boy left walking is the winner, and the prize is - anything he wants. Every year, crowds gather to watch the boys walking.<br /><br />But as the walk progresses, and the boys realize most of them would not survive and the next person killed might be you - the attraction of the walk is quickly wearing off, and the horror of exhersion or death is growing.	2005-03-06

After increasing contact with white men (some with tragic results), the tribe is evacuated from the island. At the last moment, Karana jumps off the boat since she discovers her younger brother is left behind.

When I see that people who see themselves as fans of a specific author give one of his book 1 or 2 star reviews, I know the book must be bad. Unfortunately, I only saw these reviews after spending the money to buy it & the time to read it.<br /><br />Firs of all, I found a few inconsistencies in the book. For what I undersand, while the Ceasar Square encoding system is certainly a nice one, but it isn't the way Julius Ceasar had encoded his messages... There are also a lot of plot inconsistencies: when Greg Hale admits to the murder of David, it obvious he would have no way of knowing the full details of David's mission and therefore - cannot be responsible for whatever happens to him. Also, the fact that the deputy director of the NSA would act unde such personal circumstances is VERY unplausible - or at least I'd like to believe that such high ranking officials care for more than impressing their impossible love interests when performing the job...<br /><br />Another plot point is something Dan Brown often falls for: too many plot twists. David's quest for the ring seemed to have just too many steps. It's as though Dan Brown feels the need to give each of his characters a certain quota of book time, and has trouble filling that quota...	2005-01-14

No matter how boring Becky B.'s spending habits might get, I'd still be one of the first people to get the book, and I'd enjoy every antic, shopping trip, or mishap that involves the beloved Becky.<br /><br />That said, I'd have to agree with many of he reviewers: while still enjoyable, Becky's \\"bad spending habits\\" are getting a little tired. In \\"Shopaholic Ties the Knot\\" Kinsella wisely changes the focus of the book from Becky's shopping craze (well, except for the occasional Miu Miu skirt or some antique furniture) to her unability to choose between two desirable weddings. Recycling the \\"Becky's shopping gets her into trouble\\" plot line makes the character and story lose some of their charm, almost as much as th forced inclusion of some of the \\"&ouml;lder\\" characters (Janice & Martin, Tom, Alicia). While the notion of having Becky handle &auml; \\"non - shopping\\" - holic, frugal character is fun, the idea of a long lost sister is contrived.<br /><br />On the other hand, Backy still has her charming moments. Convincing her Yogi of her spiritual enlightment (especially when running over hot coals for some very unspiritual jewelery), re - defining the concept of budget through E - Bay, or just hiking a mountain in kitten heels (and finding them usefull!) is classic Becky Brandon (nea Bloomwood). The book also ries to deal with more \\"grown up issues\\" - such as parents having lives of their own, or how friends can drift apart when one is gone for a long period of time and their lives are growing diferent (having kids, etc.).	2004-10-03

On top of that (and the vodka and chamapgne she'd been drinking), during an especially bumpy plane ride she exposes all her secrets to a handsome American stranger that happens to be sitting next to her on the plane.<br />As it turns out, the hunk is not a stranger, but rather the owner of Panther Cola (where Emma works), who turns out at the office the next morning, and seems to remember every tiny little detail of what Emma told him. And he also seems determined to act on that knowledge, and make a mess out of Emma's life. Or is it a mess?<br />Even though Emma isn't Becky Bloomwood, this is still a good read.

But Nan acts her age, and is able to show empathy and sympathy when needed, even if the lifestyle and people involved are unfimiliar and disagreeable to her. Andrea, on the other hand, is the ever - suffering spoiled and whiny brat. Her boss is just w-a-y too demanding because when Andrea goes out on an errand, she is expected to be back on time, and not waste time talking on her cell phone or smoking (no matter how silly Andrea finds the errand to be). Ignoring the office dress code is also a good thing, because obviously - being into fashion is an unforgivable sin. Anyone who actually plays by the rules - i.e. dresses properly, respects the boss, has any ambitions in the field of fashion, etc. - just has to be a mindless drone who just begs to be looked down on by our &quot;tragic&quot; heroine. While there were many situations where Miranda Priestly's demands were over the top, Andrea's rotten attitude towards everything (including many legitimate situations) just takes the edge off the outrageous parts.<br />The ending is equally outrageous. Having had to travel overseas for business, friends &amp; family understood my responsibility towards my workplace. Just like Andrea can't understand what points really are over the top, and which are just normal demands of a workplace, her family and friends can't seem to respect the responsibilities of her job (after all, it's just fashion, right? Nothing important!), so they feel they must demand her early return from her trip.<br />While I'm not into fashion myself, I didn't enjoy the &quot;fashion is useless therefore anyone who takes this seriously must be a moron&quot; attitude of the book.

Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. The fact that I felt sympathy for the books 'bad guy' (Bat Sheva's husband) but none for the heroine would easily indicate how bad the book is.<br />Being Ragen's first book, I can accept less than perfect writing. My problem here was the plot consistency (or rather - lack of). On one hand, before marrying, Bat Sheva is described as this ultra orthodox, chaste girl who goes to a private, orthodox Jewish private school, only wears modest dresses, and is proud of her heritage. But all that heritage is quickly forgotten once she gets married. The strict dressing code (no pants for women, hair covered for married women) and food code (strict kosher rules), etc. - are suddenly all forgotten in Bat sheva's quest for happiness, simply because it's her new husband who represents them, and he, in turn, represents 'evil'. Even though the interpertation of religious laws can vastly differ between sects and groups within Judaism, I'd expect someone like Bat Sheva to comply with the basics, but she doesn't. She also doesn't try and understand her husband's &amp; mother in law's point of view, but expects everyone to understand her 'tragic' stance of the misunderstood newcomer.	2004-04-28

The start of their affair was as fair tale romantic asit can get, but after marrying him, she discovers different sides of him. Another source of tension is his support of the newly reinstated Islamic Republic of Iran, and his numerous &quot;nephews&quot;from Iran who came to visit Moody, each more vile &amp; unpleasant than the one before him. Then, Betty agrees to go on a two week vacation to Iran with Moody and their daughter Mahtob.<br />As it turned out, the two week vacation because a year and a half struggle to get herself and her daughter out of Iran. The story of her struggle is fascinating - a process in which Betty learns how to cope in an unfimiliar environment, and how to deal with shadowy conspirations, while staying loyal to her daughter (Betty could've left Iran much earlier and much more easily if she were willing to leave Mahtob behind, at least temporarily(.<br />On the other hand, the book showa a lot of cultural and personal intolerance. While Betty was more than willing to admit certain Iranian individuals were good people and that the Islamic religion had its good side, the Iranian culture was described as bad simply because it was so far removed from the American culture. We are all so used to our own culture and settings that we tend to forget that other cultures might have evolved differently than ours, and that many people don't have the benefits we have.<br />This attitude also appears in Betty's description of other people. Somehow, the only Iranians she seems to like are westernized and are wary &ouml;f the Iatolla's reig over Iran. People that are typically Iranian, or women (such as Ellen) who tried aclimating to their lives in Iran are described in a cery negative light. While I'm sure Betty has more than enough reasons to resent Moody, I'm doubtnig whether he was as mentally unstable as Betty describes him, or whether cultureal &amp; attitude differences might have been the cause of some of his 'symptoms'.<br />The overall impression I still have of this book is that it serves as a very good cautionary tale about inter culture marriages. It urges the reader to reconsider the romance in these situations, and to learn more than a few exotic recipes about the others'culture before commiting to a marriage or a trip to a foerign country - Brtyy, for instance, hadn't realized she was an Iranian citizen until it was too late.	2004-01-11

After owning this book for 8 months, I finally figured out what made me dislike it so badly: the author made such heavy handed generalizations of stereotypes that I felt the book was on the verge of being racist.<br />I've often heard about the British snobism towards Americans, and every once in a while a Brit commenting about the Americans being 'a bit thick - headed' and lacking sense of humor. Lets take Jemima and Brad's first chat as an example of that: Brad asks Jemima where she is from. She types 'London', but then feels compelled to add 'England' to her answer - since he IS an American, he obviously wouldn't recognize the world renowned capital of England. As the story went on, none of the Americans can understand Jemima's simplest jokes or ever read a good book. The possibility of cultural differences (or the fact that the few American characters of the book are individuals belonging to a nation of 200+ million people and therefore cannot represent a whole nation as being morons) never entered Jane Green's mind - all these shortcomings are 'American'.<br />And the sterotypes also exist in the way weight issues are handled, making me suspect Jane Green has done little or no research on the subject of what it means to be overweight or what HEALTHY dieting involves. While people like Jemima and Janie certainly exist, other overweight people have a completely different experience of gaining weight, living with it, and losing it. But Jane Green, through Jemima, 'assures' us that only Jemima's experiences are valid and true to life: from Jemima's conversation with Lauren we learn that things like gland or hormonal problems are simply an excuse overweight people use, ignoring the fact that many people out there actually HAVE gland problems, which CAN cause weight gain. When Jemima is depressed to see Ben speaking to another woman, we learn that eating impossibly huge amounts of food in one sitting is a routine way for overweight people to handle any sort of bad news. From Jemima's encounter with Janie in the juice shop near the gym, we learn that  eating a whole package of cookies in private is also a routine habbit of overweight people, and they would only drink mineral water in front of 'thin' people to 'hide' it. By watching Jemima diet, then keep the weight off, we learn that starving & over exercising is a healthy way to lose weight, and a fat free diet and some more over exercising is an even healthier way to keep the pounds off (never mind about those unnecessary vitamins, minerals, or any other 'pesky' nutrients our bodies need to function properly). From Jemima's encounter with Brad we learn that anyone who likes overweight women is a pervert. From her relationship with Ben we learn that in order to make your 'prince' realize he loves you, you have to look like a model and dress in very minimal clothes.<br />I found these stereotypes so disturbing, because many people aren't aware that these aren't actual facts.  Even though the prologue of the book somehow does try and make things right by telling us Jemima had adapted a 'healthier' lifestyle and has stopped obsessing about her weight, the stereotypes are so ingrained in the book itself, two paragaphs of prologue aren't going to make things right.<br />My last bone to pick with Jane Green is her writing style. The first person / third person switches are annoying. The 'clues' Jane Green insists on adding in her third person passages are unnecessary, and made me feel Jane Green thought us readers are 'a bit thick', and that without them us readers would never understand the (very simple) plot. Or that we won't like the characters unless she kept telling us how likeable they are. There are also a lot of inconsistencies in the book itself - why can the editor notice Jemima's weight loss, but Ben can't (please read Ben's farewell party scene if you don't know what I was talking about)? If Jemima couldn't even climb one set of stairs, how did she manage to stay so longon the stairmaster on her first visit to the gym?<br />I'd like to end this review by giving people the message I wish Jane Green would have given: overweight people aren't big monstrous blobs of fat with an endless cascade of chins. Except for being bigger, they aren't that different from thin people.	2003-12-12

This gives a lot of room for imagination, originality (same story told from a different point of view), and social commentary, Stepgen King style.<br />One of the things I always liked about S.K.'s writing is that he usually writes about things he knows about - whether its small towns in Maine & their people, creepy monsters, etc. In many of his books, he tries making some sort of social commentary, often using the horror as a tool to demonstrate or bring out the social malady he's discussing. In this case, besides raising issues and concerns about western TV culture, he is also trying to connect the issues raised Desperation (God and religious beliefs) to raise the question: is TV our 'God' these days?<br />Unfortunately, the answer given in this book is not as half as interesting or well written out as the question is. You  think you know your characters - and suddenly, you don't. So instead of concentrating on the story, I was distracted by small details I THOUGHT I knew, but which were only relevant for Desperation, or visa versa.	2003-11-25

Often, many aspects are both, mainly because original as they are - they are taken to extremes that just destroy the point they're trying to make.<br />This is another 'chick flick' about girls trying to find the love of their lives (or at least to fill the time until that peson comes along). But unlike your usual potentially successful girl, with a potentially 'perfect' job and salary within reach, these girls have jobs like the rest of us - boring, unfulfilling, not paying that well, etc. Also, since the book was written by a guy, I was expecting a different point of view on the subject matter ('Single Girl's Life\\"). Another twist that is a bit unusual is that instead of one heroine, we get three - and each one has her twist. Gina is desperate to get married, Cheryl is an African American trying to find someone throuhg Personal Ads, and Linda is gay. But none of these potential promises are fulfilled. The characters cannot even be described as shallow - they are positvely superficial! I'm not sure where the whole Gay / Lesbian vibe was coming from, but refreshing as it was at the start of the book, it began to wear off after yet another new character was revealed to be one, and not only that - he / she are somehow connected to the other gay / lesbian population in the book.<br />The same goes for another group of people (or rather - potential dates) - the 'perverts'. Not only do they know each other, but two of our girls somehow manage to get involved with them in a matter of days!<br />I won't say \\"don't read this\\". I'll just reccomend you borrow it from your local library first.	2003-10-12

After an extremely long wait, 'Harry Potter & The Order Of The Phoenix' is finally out. And it was well worth the wait. This book isn't only the longest one in the series so far, but it is the 'deepest' one. Not only did Harry grow up, but J.K Rowling has written a much more 'grown up book' than before, to match Hary's growth. Don't worry, we still get a lot of the details about life at Hogwarts that made the previous books so charming. But we also see that the wizarding world isn't black and white: good people can come from good families, but people we thought were good might also have their wild side. That adults can make mistakes (even out of the best motives) and might not be able to reveal their reasons when you ask. But most of all, this book shows the importance of values like family, friends, loyalty, and most of all - love.	2003-06-24

She's now sharing an apartment and a bank account with Luke in NYC, and she can finally manage with the money she has to satisfy her inner shopper. She has a fashion designer living next door, a perfect job as a personal shopper in Barneys, and the only problem she now has is Elinor, Luke's mom.<br />Then Luke proposes at Suze's wedding and Becky gets in trouble - can she choose between the backyard wedding her mother and Janice, her next door neighbor, are planning, and the dream wedding Elinor insists on hosting? How can Becky choose just ONE wedding dress?<br />This book was as fun and entertaining as much as the first two books were. Sophie Kinsella was smart enough to shift the focus from Becky's shopping dilemas to something else. By having tied all the story knots successfully (including Tom &amp; Lucy Webster and Alicia), and by having a preview of a book about a different character, I suspect that this is the last we're going to hear about Becky B. (at least for a very long time). It's always good to quit while you're ahead, and I'm glad Sophie Kinsella won't push the &quot;Shopaholic&quot; series into being a never ending &amp; boring series...	2003-03-31

After reading the first few pages of the book, I was amazed at how Jane Green was able to describe the life and feelings of an overweight person.<br />All that disappeared when I bought the book and had a chance to read a few more chapters. I'd have to agree with many points that were brought up in previous reviews: the fact that Jemima coult NOT lose so much weight it such a short time, and the fact that her skin wouldn't remain so smooth after such a quick diet. The fact that Jemima 'suddenly' became amazingly gorgeous once she lost the weight (a pretty face is noticeable even if it's fat!), so amazing that her close friend Ben Williams wouldn't recognize her from close up. The fact that airlines don't upgrade people based on looks (but based on miles or on a first come basis). The fact that the cravings don't just go away (even if you're in a good mood). The fact that Jane Green has exaggerated Jemima's weight and proportions so badly. The fact that Jane Green sees Americans (especially of the \\"Californian\\" breed) as shallow, stupid, and all the other stereotypes about Americans shw could find.<br />Many reviewers defended this book by saying it is basically a fairy tale. But if so - it's a dangerous one. Modern research discovered that overweight isn't caused by just overeating and lack of exercise - which is the way Jemima describes how fat people gain weight. Yes, Jemima (or rather - Jane Green), it HAS a lot to do with glands and other metabolic processes, which make some people gain weight relatively easily, while others manage to remain thin even if they pig out on food. The ease in which Jemima lost weight in a very unhealthy way (without any consequences, ranging from loose skin to severe health problems) might mislead people who wish these dreams to come true in real life to try this method of dieting. The goal Jemima sets for herself is also unrealistic, and so is the ease she has in keeping it by maintaining a 'fat free' diet (which is also unhealthy,by the way). Jemima's 'bad eating' habbits both as an overweight person and as a thinning pesron are EATING DISORDERS, which are severe psychological problems, which need A LOT more than a crush on a guy and a few healthy doses of amateur psychology Jemima applies on herself to resolve.<br />And yes, there are overweight people out there that are in peace with their body size, and there are people who like them. These people are not freaks!<br />Not only is this book insulting to overweight people and misleading in its handling of thie problem, I shudder to think the impression thin people would get out of it. Yes, it's fun to read, but how many wrong 'facts' would they take out of it into the world? How would this alter their image of overweight people? The equasion that weight loss equals a small amount of self control in a diet has long ago been disproved by scientists to the relief of all of the people struggling to lose some for years. I hope JJ's \\"assurance\\" about it doesn't take us back 10 - 15 years in time... <br />I was really bothered by the way Jane Green made Jemima look like a 'blob' and a 'monster'. Someone who weighs 217 pounds and is 5'7\\" would be far from thin, but definitelly won't have wouldn't have 3 chins, or would look as half as monsterous as Jane Green describes her to be. The only monsters I discovered in this book are people with Jane Green's way of thinking about the weight issue, which is about 10 - 15 years out of date (just as much as her fashion sense and technological knowledge).	2003-03-11
US	52780213	R1W80KZTIZLHAH	0446363251	861890745	Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind"	Books	5	9	12	N	N	After reading a lot of other reviews..	... I noticed 2 reactions to this book. One type was the one or two star \\"how could she have written such a lousy novel\\" reactions, that often proved their point by sticking to tiny little details (such as the similarity of Scarlett's trips to Tara when she was desprate, or her having taken off her corsets). The other type of reaction was usually 3 stars or more, with an appreciation of Ripley's effort to write this sequel. I must admit I belong to the 2nd group, because I basically believe that the first book was very well written, and managed to tie all of its own loose ends except for the Scarlett and Rhett relationship - which is an end I think Margaret Mitchell herself wanted to leave loose... And this is why I found the Scarlett / Rhett aspects of the sequal so disappointing - after all the plot twists of GWTW between them, the only way to go was a variation of the one mentioned in the book: Scarlett chasing Rhett, which only makes him run further away, and only when she 'grows up' does she get him back... The inclusion of Rhett in this book seemed a little fake, and to me it felt as though Ripley had included it just to satisfy the die - hard fans of GWTW who wished to see the couple get back...<br />I think that Ripley made a wise choice by removing Scarlett from everything and everyone she knew. Scarlett had misunderstood the rules of the Atlanta 'Old Guard' and had so many chances to fix her status in GWTW that keeping her in Atlanta would have been boring. She was there long enough for us to see how low she had gone there (not being invited to parties, people ignoring her, not selling her stuff in their stores, not going into hers...), and by this stage having the 'Old Guard' forgive her would have been fake. The Old Guard's attitude was already tied and sealed by Margaret Mitchel, and all Alexandra Ripley had to do was show that Scarlett finally realizes the kind of people her new friends are, and when she throws them out she just has no one to live forin Atlanta... This might be a specific example, but in general, I felt that going back to all the locations from GWTW would have been just re - writing the first book, and I'm glad the plot was taken to new and interesting places... I suppose that many of the die hrd fans expected something with the same style and plot turns of the GWTW book - but then, why not ust read GWTW again?<br />Scarlett's moving to Ireland seemed a natural step - after not fitting into the southern society in Atlanta and Charleston, she finally finds her Irish relatives, which seem to love her, admire her, and most important of all - accept her just as she is... This is what trigers her to change. Instead of wearing a tight corset under over - decorated fancy clothes, she takes her corsets off, and wears simple peasant clothes, because she doesn't have to impress anyone with her fancy clothes - her relatives love her anyway... She finally gains status without having to act unnaturally, which makes her realize all of her natural power and talents, and eventually does become a great lady (just like her mother).<br />Even when Scarlett goes away to a whole new place, and meets new people, we still get to learn how people from GWTW are faring. This was probably a tribute to all the fans of the original book, just to justify this being a proper sequal. In general, Ashley turns out to be OK, Ella and Wade find happiness in Tara with Will and Suellen, etc.<br />In general, I think that people who are strong fans of GWTW and expected a classic sequel would be disappointed, because besides Scarlett, all other characters from GWTW appear very briefly, if at all. These 2 books are like 2 books about the same charcters, and while GWTW provieds some history for Scarlett, the later takes the story to completely different directions... So I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to accept this change.	2002-08-06

This is typically the age group Judy Blume specializes in, and I remember this book (and many other Judy Bloom) as being a very enjoyable story for me as a pre - teen and a very young one.<br />But reading this book from an adult point of view, I see things a little differently - many of Margaret's experiences are not typical. I think the most major issue is God - most kids belong to a specific religion and don't bounce around like Margaret.<br />The second issue that disturbed me was the way Margaret handled the physical changes she was going through. Even though all girls go through changes which often make them uncomfortable, Margaret is one of many girls who wish they'd grow up faster, but many girls (me at that age, for instance) were the opposite. I was more like Laura's character - being the 'most developed' girl who gets her period first (often much earlier than the other girls) and that can be just as uncomfortable as Margaret's position. But Laura isn't a fully developed character, so I think she's a character that's hard to identify with. This difference between the 'growing rate' of girls comes up in many places in the book. Margaret gets her bra just to be like the other girls and feels jealous of Nancy for having a bigger size. Being one of the first to wear one, and doing it when you can actually fill it out is a very different experience thant Margaret's - you definitelly don't stuff cotton balls into it... Actually, as a teenager I wished I could be like Margaret - in all the things she felt uncomfortable about, and might have wanted to be more like me...<br />I think this book can be a very enriching read for girls that age, and I definitely agree with one of the other reviews that reccomended this book for fathers with daughters that are about to become teens... I just wish Judy Blume would have written another book about a girl more like me or Laura - I'm sure there are many girls that age that would be able to identify with this character rather than with Margaret...than with Margaret...	2002-05-08

This seems to be just another one of those 'British Girls' books like Bridget Jones, etc. that seem to be flooding the book market lately. All of them are centered around a 30 year old (give or take a few years), her love life, and often something extra (weight in Bridget's case, money in Rebbeca's, etc), their collection of friends / foes (which is amazingly similar...) and all their problems are magically solved when they get together with the 'Perfect Guy' (the same guy they despised in the beginning of the book, but throughout it discover their attraction and beging a love / hate relationship with him up until the happy ending...), preferably after some great sex...<br />Although I really didn't like Bridget Jones's story (probably because I couldn't identify with someone so desperate), I took a chance and read it, after the clerk in the book store reccomended it as a very funny book...

I loved reading Judy Blume whne I was about 13 - 14 years old, and even though her once - loved titles (such as 'Are You There God') seem utterly childish and silly to me now, I was excited to see she had some books meant for grown ups. I've read the first few pages here, and the story seemed like a nice one - about 2 childhood friends and how this relationship keeps changing as they grow up.<br />The book starts off in the 'present' - when both girls are 25. Caitlin announces to Victoria that shes planning to mary a guy named Bru. This news upsets Victoria so much that we start to wonder who Bru is, and what are the relationships between these 3 people.<br />Unfortunately, only the beginning is this intruguing. The book is pretty much predictable - 2 young girls become friends. The ugly duckling overcomes her hardships and becomes a success story, while the 'princess' turnes out to be a totally [messed] up person, who marries her friend's ex - first boyfriend... The character development of the first summer is pretty good (which is usually the age level Judy Blume writes about, by the way), but as sumers go by, the story has less details and is harder to read	2002-03-03

This is a story about 5 generations of women in a 'cursed' family - where all men are somehow damaged - retarded, die at a young age, or abandon their wives. This story is told by the last woman in the chain - the one who gives birth to a healthy baby boy and breaks the curse, who investigates (with us in tow) her family history.<br />This book has all the elements of a soap opera - kitch, romance, 'grave' tragedy, many twists and turns and changes in marital and family status... For people like me, who don't favor the 'sticky romance' genre, I'd reccomend to skip this book.	2001-12-27

Ms. Horn has spent 5 years in Japan, and relates her personal experiences there. Her personal point of view is very evident in the book - as a vegetarian, she describes a very special meals friends had invited her to, and as a pet lover, she describes the Japaneses' treatments of animals. This personal point of view can be a great bonus, but on the other hand has its drawbacks for those who are looking for a more accurate story about Japan. I really enjoyed this personalized point of view, since I'm Israeli and could easily see what Ms. Horn thought was funny, strange or disturbing. Someone who is not fimiliar with the Israeli attitude towards things might not have this full understanding of the author's point of view.	2001-12-21

This book tells of 3 years of Laura's life between ages of 15, when she first goes out to teach school - to 18, when she gets married.<br />We witness Laura's growing up and realization that life is changing all around her. Mary is in college, and is independent enough to want to stay with a friend for the summer instead of coming home. It's obvious that Laura's relationship with her sisters and friends in school are changing - in 'Little Town on the Prairie' her school life for example, and her after school or weekend social activities with her friends are a large part of the book, but now we only hear of a few remote incidents, and we hardly hear anything about the going ons there, for instance we don't really get to know Florence, the new 'big girl'. This is partly due to the increasing role of Almanzo Wilder's part in Laura's life, but I think that is also partly due to the fact Laura isn't attending school full time anymore, but rather teaches school herself for a term or two a year.Except for Ida's small part in Laura's wedding, we don't hear of them any more for the rest of the series.<br />We also see Laura herself change: part of it is what I just mentioned about the change in what she describes in her social life. Another one would be her very detailed description of her clothes and fashions - even though we do hear about her dresses in previous books, she seems much more occupied with them this time, like any teenage girl... In betwen the lines, we do see that the Ingles family is doing better financially - they are improving their house, and can often afford luxuries such as a sewing machine and an organ for Mary.<br />I did find a few points I didn't like in this book, compared to the previous books in the series:<br />1) Instead of giving an account of a relatively short period (a year or 2, like in the previous books), we are now covering 3 years, and we usually get an 'in depth coverage' of a relatively short period, or a few remote incidents, then run through a long period which is skipped. Laura only described her first school with as much details as I was used to in her previous books, but the next 2 schools are hardly mentioned... It isn't as bad as her descriptions in 'The First Four Years', but it's still noticeable.<br />2) We get a lot more of Almanzo, while we get less of the pioneer life of that era... This is an semi - autobiography of Laura's life, not a history book, I admit, but I think that the historical and cultural element of these books has been a major attraction for readers, especially the older ones.	2001-11-22

The prologue of this book tells us that this book was originally not meant for publishing by Laura, and that might explain it's different style than the other books in the series. This might be due to some of the tragedies she and her family went through -financial disasters, the death of their 2nd child... Another explanation might be that Almazo passed away, and Laura had no heart to go on writing... These differences really got in the way of my reading enjoyment. Even though they don't seem like much, but for me this is the differenct between reading Laura's other book and reading a textbook describing the era...<br />The most obvious difference is that even though this is the shortest book in the series, it covers a long period of 4 years (I think it's the longest period covered in a single book of the wseries, even more than 'These Happy Golden Years). So what we get are a little sketchy stories of Laura's 4 four years of marriage, not a detalied description of the young couple's lifestyle.<br />Another difference, is in the storyteller's point of view. In previous books, it was obvious Laura tells her side of things, Now the story is told in a more detached way, and even though Laura is THE major player in it, she IS a character, not the storyteller...<br />This book is reccomended for people who were curious to know a bit more about Laura. But after reading this, I'm as eager as ever to read some of her future tales as I was, but I'm not as eager to have to read them in this format...	2001-11-17

This gives the readers a different point of view of the lifestyles of people in that era, and one of a boy, not a girl, at that.	2001-11-17

Since I've first read this book when I was a little younger than Laura, so I was really excited to read what life was like 'back then' for kids my age.<br />The hard winter is finally over, and the Ingalls family finally moves out to their claim, where Laura enjoys the outside work and the sunshine. But then she is offered a job as a seamstress in town, and takes it even though she misses the outdoors. The work is hard, and the environment is unpleasant, but Laura sticks it out.<br />Ma=ry finally has a chance to go to the blind college in Iowa, and while Ma and Pa take her there, Laura, Carrie and Grace clean the house.<br />School finally begins again, and an unpleasant surprise comes along on the first day - Nellie Oleson from Plum Creek, who schemes and causes trouble. The high point of this situation is the troble between Laura and Ms. Wilder, the teacher, who only hears unpleasant things about Laura from Nellie, and Laura's short temper, especially where Carrie is concerned, does not help the situation... But Ida, the new girl, is nice enough to make up for Nellie's unpleasantness.<br />Laura is grown up enough to want fashionable cloths and all other fashionable things other girls her age in school have, such as name cards. She is invited to parties and attends her first evening sociable.<br />We start seeing the relationship between Laura and Almanzo Wilder start developing (even though I think her relationship with his sister, her unpleasant ex - school teacher, might give things an interesting twist).	2001-11-17

The story is told from the point of view of Laura, their second daughter, and reflects her age in the language and stories she tells us - her most memorable Christmas memory is Charlotte, her first 'real' doll.<br />Even though this book might appear childish at first, it tells a lot about people's lives back then, and the sort of day to day house keeping and tasks they had to face. This will definitely appeal to all people who are interesterd in that point of view about history.	2001-11-17

My rating is based on a combination of two factor.<br />Steve Thayer obviously did a very thorough research about news casting, police inverstigation and meteorology before writing this book, and it shows.<br />On the other hand, the story line isn't very good. I'm not sure whether this is a murder investigation story involving a news station or a story about the dynamics of a newsroom with a background story of a serial killer, but the 2 very prominent story lines doesn't give a feeling of a 'focused' story. The time gaps between the different parts of the book also makes it hard to read. We don't see the whole process of Rick Beanblossom and Andrea Labore's relationship changing from deep dislike to love and marriage, we only see segments of different stages of it. We witness atrial based on partial evidence, and a few pages the guy is sentenced to death, and is about to be executed after all his appeals and petitions weren't accepted.<br />I'm sure many people noticed the striking resemblence od the botched electrocution scenes in this book and the Green Mile - did one author get any ideas from the other, or did they both stumble of the same evidence / idea somewhere? I wonder...	2001-11-11

I'm a pretty dedicated fan of Stephen King, and even though I don't expect to like ALL his books as much as I liked The Stand or It, I do expect some originality which is totally missing from this book. Axtualy, this book is so bad that I couldn't make myself read any more than the first 150 pages or so! I only managed to read that far because I kept thinking that it just HAD to get better...<br />The book tells of four friends who had once saved a Downs Syndrome boy in Derry, and as a result became telepathic. These concepts are already unoriginal: the Stand had a charming but powerful retarded boy (Tom Cullen), and the dreams of Mother Abagail / the Dark Man that were equivalent to telepathy, while It had a bunch of Derry kids with special powers 'save the day'.<br />An alien spaceship roams near their hunting cabin having already abducted a few humans (and planted a weasel like embryos in them), and spread some nasty orange grass / fungus everywhere. Now this is your basic X - Files alien stuff, and also reminds me of 'true stories' of people who claim to have been abducted in the past. Of course the group's special 'powers' (or rather the 2 friends who hadn't been horribly killed in the first 50 pages) help them save the world and overcome a government cover up of this stuff (X - Files basics again). I peeped in the last pages of this book, and it seems they eventually got their way, and got out alive...<br />The book seems to promise a lot: the friends are originally from Derry, which supplied great plots in the past (It and Insomnia). It deals with the values of friendship and kindness towards weaker people in our society, which have their own special powers (The Stand, It). It also deals with spaceship and aliens, which is a subject that fascinates many people and is a great way to introduce horror into a story (like the lost spaceship in The Tommyknockers). All the books mentioned in this paragraph deal with these subjects a lot better than the Dream Catcher, and these are books I definitelly reccomend to people interested in reading stuff that made Stephen King what he is.<br />It's pretty well known that Stephen King wrote this book while recovering from a pretty bad accident, and he mentioned in the preface for this book that a lot of his physical pain and discomfort went into this story. Writing might be a great way to deal with this pain, but maybe a non - horror book (such as Hearts in Atlantis) would have been a better scope for such a battle...	2001-11-11

She is also contacted by a famous psychic who claims to hear Adam's voice and gives Nell his love... But things are not as simple as they seem, and the tangled ending reveals a well planned scheme.<br />The story line is weak and uses too many 'coincidences' for my taste, such as 2 simialar jackets...

While this book is very well written (except for a slight 'name issue' - NoNo, Min Fu, etc.), and is about a conflict we all experience at some point (why and how do we make the decisions that shape our lives?) this book doesn't the 'whole story', and only shows certain, and very few, aspects of it. Rebecca Davitch never asks herself 'why had I made the choices I've made?' but immediatelly persumes they are based on one moment she appeared happy while she wasn't, and now she's trying to straighten our everything - she will return to her old college sweetheart, his daughter should be what she imagined her to be, and she'll return to be the intelectually inclied person she as before marrying the 'wrong' guy. Only by failing all these missions does she realize she's happy with her life. She hardly goes into the 'positive' reasons for making the decisions she's made, and she often sees the bad side in everything - her life is boring and the only people she sees are her quarreling 3 step daughters and daughter, old Poppy and repairmen...	2001-11-02

The pace of the book is slow, and it is very conservative in its ideas. Even though I don't enjoy excessive dirty language, the morals of this book are so different than the 'modern' ones that it makes it hard to thoroughly understand, especially for a non - American who doesn't have the proper historical background.<br />Then why 2 stars?

The human race is of course destructive to everyone including itself, and is certainly not as enlightened as much as most species, especially the wonderfull octospiders, except for a sacred few humans, such as Nicole, most of her family, and most their closest friends. It seems that the co authors 'fell in love' with the octospiders, and made them all they thought the human race should aspire to...<br />This book stretches the ideas of the previous 2 books in the collection TOO far, and is by far the worst of the series. The plot continues to deteriorate, and so do the characters - especially the ones introduced earliest in the series. The 'total understanding' we are supposed to reach through Nicole is quite useless and over dramatic - by this stage, no one needs THAT much understanding of what's behind Rama. All the original questions behind the original Rama ship were given the most predictable and banal answers, which is to badconsidering they were excellent questions to start with.	2001-09-05

My worst problem with the first Rama book was the over technical language and he general lack of deep characters. This book seems to be trying to fix this flaw, but instead of doing that it went too far and this over - characterization - and depth seems worse than the lack of it. There were too many insignificant details - like a description of Nicole's dress and hair style before the 'big' party, or too much romance that distracted my mind from the SF part of the book. Being fimiliar with AC Clarke's usual SF books, I can only guess all these unecessary additions were Gentry Lee's contribution. Reading a chapter from his own book at the end emphasises it - especially since he seems to be fascinated wit religion, which is not AC Clarke's strong suit...<br />I'm sure many of the people who read and loved the original Rama book had a lot of questions in mind, and many of these were answered in this book, and many of Rama's secrets were revealed. This might make the one star rating I was forced to give it.	2001-09-05

As people who might have read some of my reviews probably noticed - I have this really bad case against sequels - they always seem to have too many facts of the first book restricting them, and too much to live up to. This sequel is no different. I could give Rama 2 some credit for trying to fix some problems that were in the original book, and it did try to be different, as bad as the result was. This junk is even worse!<br />We are finally destined to meet the makers of Rama, and a bunch of other aliens besides, and are exposed to some REALLY advanced technology. Wow!<br />Then we head back to earth to pick up 200 other human 'specimen'. At first all goes well under Nicole's leadership, but since the human society is so diverse crime evolves, and the criminals take over the habitat, and Nicole's family is put in jeopardy. The last scene in this book is her escape from jail the morning beore her execution.<br />Why read this book? We do learn a little more about Rama, about the aliens we already know, and about the ones we don't know, and get quite a big helping of the blah blah I resented so much in Rama 2 (again - this is an unfimiliar theme in other AC Clarke books - so I guess it has something to do with Gentry Lee joining in?)

I borrowed this book from a co worker while I was abroad, and regreted it ever since, because it was even worse than having nothing to read at all... There were 2 things that ruined my enjoyment of this book:<br />1) the main reason was that the plot, and Kay's actions, were totally illogical - someone who is afraid of a murderer stalking her would be more careful than Kay was, for instance... Unlike what I'd expect from a professional dective, Kay Scarfetta doesn't use logic but follows her intuitions, which don't seem to be based on anything but her vague feelings that it must be saw, and each and every one of those feelings turn out to be true... That doesn't make the book very believavle...<br />2) when an author writes a more than one novel wuth the same main character, you could casually pick up of of the books in the middle of the 'series', or even the last book of it, and have a pretty good idea of what's going on, even though you'd have a much broader outlook of things if you read the previous books in the series. But not only does PC use Kay Scarffeta as her main character in numerous books, but she brings Temple Brooks Gault, the villain, back from the past, without giving a thorough background of his and Kay's history, just a little line saying Gault has some things to resent about the detective... And so on... This is just one examples of past characters and occurances that are mentioned in this book that occured or were introduced in the past, and there are so many of them that it really makes the book very vague and gives you a feeling you don't understand even half of it without having read the previous books. This might be OK for fans of the author but it doesn't make casual readers, like me, want to research enough to get the prior books and read them....	2001-06-02

Anyone interested in the Harry Potter series is probably aware of how the story line goes, so I'll skip it.<br />This is no different than all previous books of the series - in it's originality, sense of humor and the fact it makes a good read for both adults and kids.

As Harry Potter grows up, he starts to get into more serious trouble. This time he has an even bigger showdown with Lord Voldemort, which he seems to be able to survive only because of his magical background - a magician growing up with the harrowing tales of you - know - who's terrible force would have probably just died of fright seeing him arrise again.<br />We also see how Harry and his friends finally start growing up and becoming teenagers - going to balls, getting interested in the opposite gender... This 'growing' up is accompanied by a darker mood throughout the whole book, which starts out as an incident in the Quidditch World Cup, when Death Eaters (Lord Voldermort's supporters) cause some trouble, and it climaxes as we see Lord Voldermort ressurected, and starts gathering his followers again, even though this event was to be expected since the first book, where we learned about the Dark Lord's tries to grab the sorcere's stone.<br />J.K. Rowling still has the knack of inventing many 'magical' surprises for us, such as aparating and 'splinching' as new magical tricks, quite a bit more information on the dark arts and some history of the events before and after Lord Voldermort has fallen, and of course - we're being introduced to different wizarding schools, and finally understand why Hagrid is so big!<br />The only faults I find with this book, and I've taken off a star for are:<br />1) The plan of fetching Harry Potter by letting him survive through the Triwizard context, and then turning the cup into a portkey sounded a little too complex, and it was hard to guarantee that Harry would even be allowed to compete, and winning seems more improbable - why not give him a portkey in a more simple and direct way when everything else was ready?...<br />2) Hermione's fight for elves' rights started with a big bang, but after a while we stopped hearing about it - why?	2001-05-25

I've had a hard time finishing this book, because Winnie's tragic life has been so alike to the stories of the mothers of the &quot;Joy Luck Club because the basic settings of both books are an unresolved communication problem between an Asian American daughter and her Chinese mother. In this book, Pearl is afraid to tell Winnie about being, and Winnie is afraid to tell Pearl of her own secret - a bad marriage in China. &quot;Auntie&quot; Helen, Winnie's long time friend and foe, threatens both to reveal their secrets if they don't do that themselves until the Chinese New Year. In the next part of her book, Winnie narrates her long, &quot;tragic&quot; marriage to a man named Wen Fu back in China during WW2, which is supposed to be somehow connected to the Chinese myth of the Kitchen God's wife - which was a VERY good wife to a very bad man herself.<br />Winnie did not stir any sympathy from me. At first, being a very young and innocent girl, I can inderstand why Winnie does not run away. But after a while, it seems all Winnie wants to do is complain about Wen Fu and show to the whole world how bad he is. She can't understand why his friends don't realize who he really is - what she sometimes sees as him being mean to them, they see as a joke. Even when she does try to escape from him, it seems those tries are doomed from the start because she manages to choose the best ways to annoy Wen Fu and damage his pride.The story also seemed to repeat itself a few times (Wen /Fu is mean, Winnie tries to escape but can't), and none of the characters seemed to change much each time, except for maybe Wen Fu, who get meaner by the page, and turns into a less credible character.<br />We're also exposed to Winnie's vain and jealous side - in the way she treats Helen... Almost everything Helen does is bad or wrong - from Winnie's high class point of view, of course. Never mind that Helen got the better, more understanding and more superior husband...<br />The only thing about this book which raised its mark from 1 start to 3 is Amy Tan's superb writing. Many people who liked the &quot;Joy Luck Club&quot; would probably like this book too, as long as they don't expect it too be THAT different.

This book is a little different that Amy Tan's previous books: instead of a  Chinese mother - American daughter resolving their differences, we get a different angle on the subject of the &quot;Typical&quot; Asian - American woman, who is used to her regular American / western life with a small touch of Chinese culture, usually given by an older Chinese female relative, and somehow discovers how she's really more in touch with her Chinese roots than she thought she was, and that helps her resolve some other problems in her life... In this case, the older relative is not a mother, but a half sister, and the Chinese Story is not the mother's tragic roots, but a &quot;fairy tale&quot; the sister seems to believe actually happened. We are also taken on a trip to China this time, and get another point of view on these young women's heritage - we might see them as Chinese, but in China they are regarded as forigners...<br />Amy Tan's writing is as good as usual, but that didn't make her almost identical plot of west and east clashing interesting enough to read once again - I feel that the theme in all her first three books are too close to be an interesting read for a long time...	2001-03-30

After reading about 2 - 3 Poirot books, I've noticed a pattern forming in them: a murder occurs, Hercule Poirot, with his distinctive personality and habits is called on the scene, another murder (or maybe 2) happen, and then Poirot manages to superbly solve the mystery. Then, he calls up everyone, tries to put the blame on each person (and make the innocents squirm...), and finally revealing the case against the criminal. This book lacked this pattern: Poirot was assisting the police (a very rare occurance in more modern mysteries, where the \\"good\\" detective has to work against them) to solve a crime, and the blame was put on a certain character after being framed by another one.<br />Even though this was an original book in that respect, I found the story as a whole very predictable, old fashioned (which is to be expected since it was written quite a while ago) and full of places where I figured out how useless the police or Poirot were acting, and came up with a better way of doing things myself... Also, the description of the foreign students seemed a little prejusticed to me, even though the different era could account for that, too.	2001-03-23

Unlike the previous 2 - 3 books in the Anne series, this is a book I've really enjoyed. It tells the story of Anne's youngest daughter, Rilla, and her experiences during WW1.<br />I've enjoyedrealizing how Rilla takes after her mother in her point of view on life - her love of romance, her stubborness, her imagination, her ability to describe situations through her writing, and most of all - the way she always gets herself into unexpected situations - wearing 2 different shoes when trying to look her best, or ending up raising a war baby...

This book is the exact opposite of that. The story looks like the authors made it as predictable as they could. I wouldn't be able to distinguish this book from any other \\"aliens approaching earth\\" book. Actually I could, because all other books of that genre I've read had been a lot more original... This book looks like a bad mix of all the most trivial and boring factoids of them all - about the aliens, at least. The idea of combining the art of dance in science fiction is original, I admit, and the dancing sequences seemed very original too, but being a non dancer, it was very hard for me to visualize them, so I found nothing interesting about this book.<br />As in many science fiction books, this book tries to let us handle the technical aspects of future life and space travel by just naturally implementing these in the book, as though we were supposed to know them. In most cases, these just blend naturally into the story. This is one of the cases I felt it didn't blend in too well, which made reading this book not as smooth as I expected it to be - maybe because I was reading this book around the time these things were 'happening', I just couldn't visualize space travel like the one in the book happening in 'our' world.<br />This book combines a bad style of writing and a boring and predictable story. With all the alien stories, TV shows, movies, etc. it's very hard to write a good one - even Stephen King had managed to write a bad book about this subject (\\"Dreamcatcher\\"). The only people that might be interested in it are people who really into dancing. If you're also a science fiction fan - even better. For those people - I reccomend the local library. For others - go elsewhere! Most sci - fi books I've read are SO much better than this.	2001-03-15

This book is mostly about the 3 children who had moved into the manse. Even though they are very &quot;different&quot; and interesting kids, I don't find them interesting, unlike Anne was when she was younger. I've seen a review which compares Faith to Anne - in their ways of getting into all sorts of unpredictable and unexpected trouble, imaginations, and making up all sorts of original excuses... But I felt Faith lacked Anne's fire and zest and didn't impress me at all.<br />This books is drifting apart from the series' main character - Anne. She is a small, supporting character in this book , and the closest we get to hearing about her are a few small stories about her kids... Which is my main reason for feeling this book should not belong in the Anne series...	2001-03-15

This book tells of Anne's marriage after having quite a few more children and worries - does Gilbert still love her? Is he still attracted to his college sweetheart?<br />I didn't feel that Anne had developed enough as a character to be worth another book - maybe it's because her children (lovely as they are) are starting to dominate the book. Maybe it's because unlike the previous books, the changes in her life (e.g. moving to Ingleside and having kids) was not a major &quot;bend in the road&quot; but rather a walk down a straight one from her last book, and even though the road might be a lovely one, it does not contain as many surprises as a bend would. All of her other books had a bend, or a little twist, between them, and I feel I miss it in this book.<br />The main characters added to this book are the children, and Susan. The children are all somewhat similar to Anne, they are not Anne herself as a child, and they all seemed a little &quot;bland&quot; to me by comparrison to her. Even though they were all difference ages, which would have made them more likely to experience different events on different levels, they do not, which is a little disappointing.<br />Susan, on the other hand, is nothing but bland - she has her own ways, her own opinions and basically - a woman who knows her own mind, unusual as all of those above might appear to be. She is just so funny sometimes! God bless Lucy Maud Montgomery for inventing her!	2001-03-12

In this book, Anne and Gilbert are finally married, and are starting to build their family. They move away from Avonlea, and meet some new friends.<br />I consider this book to be the last book of the &quot;Anne&quot; series, since the following books in the series are mainly concentrated in her children, and Anne is just a minor character. Even though they are very charming, and each one has his or her &quot;Anne - ish&quot; side, they are not Anne, I feel as though this is a farewell to Anne. I like this book because in it, Anne has managed to maintain her &quot;magic&quot;- she might not make as many mistakes while cooking or baking, and might not lose her temper at a passing neighbor, and her hair is not as red as it used to be but she is still the same Anne in spirit - passionate, romantic... With her quick eye for romance, she manages to attract the people who would easily supply her with an abundance of it in many froms - both tragic and comic.<br />The only thing I didn't like about this book is that by moving away from Avonlea, we lose many of the characters we had grown to love through the years - Marilla, Diana, and many other acquaitances, and of course - Green Gables itself..	2001-03-12

She has to deal with a snobbish local family, and an uncooperative and unfriendly vice principal.

Each has a daughter whome she hopes to raise as a perfect American, while holding on to what they see as valuable Chinese values. Their daughters, in turn, have to dela with their mothers' demand, which sometimes seem totally foreign to the American environment they're growing in. Both mothers and daughter seem to be trapped between the Chinese and American cultures, and many of their dilemas deal with the need to find a compromise between the two almsot opposite cultures.<br />This cultural strain is just another burden in the already heavy burden of mother daughter relationships. Both mothers and daughters try to talk, or show their love by trying to help the other out, but both actions and words are misiterrepted by the other as something negative.<br />One of the strongest points of this book is that all 4 pairs of mother / daughter know each other, and this gives the reader a few points of view of each relationship, and how the older women treat the younger generation, and visa versa.	2001-03-09

The book is made up fo 5 different stories - some quite long, some quite short, and are meant to handle the &quot;Vietnam&quot; generation - the guys that fought there, or just stayed at home.<br />The book starts off with the story of an 11 year old boy, Bobby Garfield, who befriends an elderly new neighbor who suspects that &quot;low men in yellow coats&quot;. Bobby doesn't believe him at first, but of course he eventually gets the chance to witness these peoples and their signs in the area. Even though I've read some people commenting these stories were a lot like the &quot;Gun Slinger&quot; (??) which I haven't read, but I still enjoyed this part, which was actually my favorite.<br />The next 3 parts are more related to the war itself: a story of a college student during that era, with the war in the background as a threat to anyone dropping out of school, the story of a veteran doing pennance for his sins, and a story of a meeting of 2 war veterans years later. These stories feature 3 characters from Bobby's story: his 2 best friends, Carol Gerber and &quot;sully&quot; John Sullivan, and a catholic - school boy they had known in their childhood. The final story is the reuniting of Carol and Bobby in &quot;Sully John&quot;'s funeral.<br />It seems that the main thread connecting the book, besides the fact that all the characters belong to the &quot;Vietnam Generation&quot; are the 3 friends: Bobby, John and Carol. That made me feel the stories were somehow artificial and forced, instead of just flowing naturally - even though this &quot;characters in common&quot; thread might have been added to give them more depth. I didn't like the division into loosely related sub stories - even though the first two were relatively long, the last 3 stories were too short for me to fully get to know the characters and their motivations.	2001-03-09

After a few haunting dreams of that same summer house by the lake, Mike decided to go there to see if that would end his writer's block. He discovers his house is haunted, and almost runs into a daughter of a young single mother in need of assistance against an evil grandfather who wishes to have the girl for himself.

Is the fact some men are just TOO careful (like in aa situation men won't pick up or help a crying child so  it won't look suspicious) means we've taken this too far sometimes?

The book tells the story of a young English major who finds herself breaking down mentally and being treated by electric shock in a special institute. This novel is said to be based on the life of the author, Sylvia Plath.<br />Is Esther a younger version of Sylvia, or just a wannabe girl with ambitions to become a poet / author / journalist? Or maybe this is just the way Sylvia sees herself, denying all her literary accomplishments? I find that to be one of the most interesting questions raised in the book.<br />I sensed that Esther's main problem was not knowing how to handle the world around her once she got out of the &quot;perfect&quot; environment of being a star pupil in school and college, and living in a world where she might not be the &quot;star&quot; but the average person or even fail evry once in a while... She starts to feel confused while staying in NYC. Even though she got that stay as a prize in a competition, and the prize could be seen as a high point for her, once she gets there she finds herself in social and personal situations she just can't handle properly. Some are minor, such as drinking the water meant for cleaning her fingers in dinner - and some more serious, like getting involved with Doreen's newfound friends, and finding out too late that she'd rather spend time with the &quot;nicer&quot; girls, boring as they might be compared to the former.<br />When she finally gets back home, she experiences the first &quot;academic&quot; failure she has in a while - not being accepted to a writing course she was absolutely sure she'd get into. She hadn't made other plans, and is so shocked by the failure she just spends her time doing nothing in her mom's house, and that eventually drives her to think the thoughts and ask the questions that eventually break her down.<br />Her treatment at the institute sounds like a &quot;standard&quot; and obvious, but I found the descriptions of the other patients rather amusing in a cynical and black humor sort of way...<br />Esther has a very distorted view of men. The sofisticated men of New York all turn out to be creeps and empty headed people, the guy wshe chooses to lose her virginity with is a calculated women chaser, and even Buddy, who seems to be the perfect guy at first - handsome and smart medical student - turns out to be the sort of person who looks down on Esther, her ambitions and thoughts, and her mental situation.	2000-12-06

The opposite of that appears in the Indian village - filth, insufficient food clothes or medical attention, and so on, but these people can still FEEL - the romance and tragedy of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;... Which is better? The book lets you decide for yourself... It's only problem is its one dimensional and predictable characters, but even they don't manage to ruin a good book and a good message...	2000-11-30

The story of an orphaned little girl being adopted by a neanderthal clan in the latest ice age is very original, especially the description of their language, food, medicines, and ways of life in general. But what disturbs me about the book is whether these facts are actually correct: forMrs. Auel's saying her book is based on a very vast study of the subject. But a few years ago I've read an article about how neanderthals could talk just like us if anybody bothered to teach them - this is a MAJOR slip for a book that's supposed to be more or less accurate... I do understand how the fact that the Clan's language is not a vocal one enhances the plot of this book and the following ones, but maybe this inaccuracy should have been mentioned right next to Mrs. Auel's statement about her vast research... This way, I feel I can never be sure about any other 'facts' in the story.<br />Another issue I wasn't comfortable about in the whole series is its feminist message. Even though I'm a woman, and believe in women's rights, I think that the importance of each gender's role in the clan wasn't given enough attention just to stress the 'unfairness' of it all. I think it's wrong to judge a society so different from our own, in time, herritage and customs, by our own standards of right and wrong.	2000-11-27

I've read 'The Valley of the Horses' mainly because I was wondering how Ayla was doing after being banned from the Clan... I think that this book was trying to show the &quot;Others'&quot; reaction to Ayla - some would like her instantly, some would grow to like her... Jean Auel just doesn't manage to give this story a life of its own, and it remains flat and 2 dimensional - all the people's reactions were to be expected from what I gathered about the others in 'The Valley of Horses'.<br />Some other reader described the love triangle of this book as 'soap opera-ish'.

This book has a very interesting point of view concerning telepathy and our, and other species' place and purpose in this universe. It portrays the changes occuring in the human attitude towards the aliens from the moment they got here to the point the human race (in its present form) is diminished.<br />The only point that slightly disturbed me is the fact the aliens were given a better set of morals - but human morals after all. That seemed a little unnatural to me in a race so different than our own. Personally, I would expect their morals to be different (if they have morals at all, that is) - but simply different, not considered as better / worse than our own.	2000-11-25

Not only does the book portray the religious tensions between the Catholics and protestants, but it does manage to give us the Japanese characters' point of view on things, and their special way of thinking. One of its strengths is its very tolerant point of view towards what might seem strange beliefs and behaviors at first by showing us how John Blackthorne becomes a &quot;true&quot; Japanese, especially when we compare him to his friends who remain disgusted at them, while still holding on to his stronger Christian values.	2000-11-25

I've just finished reading a review where the phrases &quot;hated it&quot; and &quot;awful&quot; were repeatedly mentioned. I couldn't agree more. Giving this book even a one star rating is more than it deserves for the following reasons:<br />1) the very few scientific facts appearing in this book that I DID know prior to reading it were totally wrong in the book - you get a WHOLE chromosome from each parent, not 2 different strands that combine into 2 chromosomes with a strand of each parent in each - this is scientifically impossible from what I've learned in 9th or 10th grade level biology!<br />2) The book was so full of stereotypes you don't have to read more than a few pages to fill in the rest with guesswork. It seems Ken Follet has left wing opinions, so for him right wing = evil. Or the stereotypic jail description..<br />3) The EXTREME chauvinistic attitude of the book - in order for a woman to be strong, she has to be masculine - both physically and though her personality and attitude to life, while a &quot;feminine&quot; woman is portrayed as weak... Please compare Mish or Jeannie to Jeannie's friend Lisa or her sister Patty... The former two are more 'manly' and aggressive , and the later are feminine and soft. The first 2 don't have an harmonious family and are not the type to be raped, while the other 2 are... The former 2 get things accomplished and are exected to do the hard job and decisions, while the later 2 are more dependent on others to do the hard work and decide the tough decisions for them.<br />4) Too many twists and turns of the plot, especially towards the end!<br />5) Jeannie's academics are ALL MIXED UP - she did a master's degree in computers, and now is wsorking in the psychology department on genetics research (which is a field in biology?) Why would an assistant in the psychology department have a nurse's or doctor's skill of drawing blood?<br />6) I've saved the 'best' for last. As a woman reading what I persume is a thriller, IRESENT having to read all about what different underwear the women wore or how they're built. Let's take Jeanie for example. Whoever suffered through this book probably knows that she's tall and that she has an athletic body build with long, flowing dark curly hair, smooth back, smooth and flat tummy, long muscly legs, and small breasts with dark nipples which she thinks are too small, but all the men she'd been with like them just fine. Oh, and she also likes tp have her nipples sucked, and thinks that going without any underwear is sexy just in case 'her man' comes along and wants a quickie. I hope this pasage does not upset anyone, but my point is that all this info has NOTHING to do with the plot, weak as the later might be. So do Lisa's red lace underwear or large bra size. This is not a porn story, so being able to envision Jeannie naked does not enhance the story. I normally don't mind a little sexual stuff in books I read, but this is simply too much and too specific in this context!	2000-11-03

Let's start with the only thing I disliked about this book: since many facts WERE unkown about Joan's life, the author made them up, and I just didn't like many of those made up facts: I thought that the concept that Joan got pregnant from a secret love afair was a little too far fetched - the idea that someone found out about her gender and threatened her with it sounds more plausible to me, knowing human nature. But 'that's something I've realized before buying the book. I still bought it because the historical basis of it all sounded fascinating.

I think the two themes I liked most about this book were the fact that all kids were flawed in some way, yet together they've formed a pretty big force... The second theme relates to the fact that I hadn't finished reading the book in the correct order - the last part I read was the scene where all seven of the kids vow to return to fight It if necessary, and the fact that after that, they've never met all together, but rather in smaller groups. Maybe the fact that around that time they've all started to &quot;heal&quot; from their flaws had something to do with that...	2000-11-01

I didn't like this book as much as the first two in the trilogy because of three reasons. The first one is that Emily has grown up, and like most of us had lost all her childish charms and ambitions, and now is just anither  down to earth grown up, not that charming, amusing and odd little child.  The second reason is that is seems that the author had very little to add  about Emily, mainly Emily finding a proper husband and her growing writing  career, and  think these two subjects would have filled a much shorter  book. Things would not have been that bad if the ending hadn't been so  lame, which is my third and most important reason for not liking this book:  Teddy just shows up one day out od nowhere and with no special and logical  reason, whistles his three notes, and everything is fine between himself  and Emily.

King. I picked  up this book after missing a bus, and having nothing to do until the next  one came along 30 minutes later, I went to the bookstore in the nearby  mall. After reading the short summary on the back, I thought &quot;Well,  this could be interesting..&quot;, and decided to buy it. I must admit I  cancelled the appointment I've had because it was getting too late, and  went back home and skipped a part of my algebra class just so I can read  this book. It took me 2 weeks to finish it, and I admit I liked the first  part a lot better than the second one (the &quot;Good vs. Evil&quot;),  because I thought it had a ring of truth in it - something like this could  easily happen to us nowadays, and it gave me a lot to think about the human  race playing games with stuff that would better be left alone...	2000-04-26

Learning about the Sepharadic Jews' lives, and the choices they had to make (and how different people made those decisions) were fascinating, and I  think that the fact the story is told first hand only makes it more alive.  If the book had only consisted of this part, I would have wanted to give it  at least 6 - 7 stars!<br />On the other hand, there's the cover story of the  grandmother sending her two granddaughters on a quest. The characters  seemed shallow and all their actions were expectable - the heroic  grandmother finally realizing what to do when facing death, the two grand  daughters falling head over heals over the first two men they meet. The  couples get together, then fight over a major point, then the girls go back  to their old lives, realized what they were missing, and made their  compromise, which of course meant going back to their lovers and changing  in the exact way their grandmother had expected. Throughout this part of  the book I felt that &quot;I've been there and done that&quot;. I don't  think I would have given this part of the novel even one star...	2000-04-12

I loved Naomi Ragen's first two books - her characters were living people with what seemed to me real dilemas they had to deal witn within the boundries of their personal beliefs.<br />But Bat Sheva HaLevi just doesn't  seem right - from the start. At first she is portrayed as this ultra  orthodox girl, but when she gets married she doesn't realize that she has  to COMPLETELY cover her hair and wear skirts? Even I, as an unorthodox Jew  know that much.... I don't think that a truely orthodox girl would put  herself in certain situations the way Bat Sheva did - like going to an  unkosher restaurant. And even though there is a little sympathy for her  husband at first, after that he is portrayed as a &quot;monster&quot;, even  though he had to face a wife that had values so different than he was  raised to expect, and he just didn't know how to deal with her, and get her  to understand the values he believed in. Doesn't he deserve some  understanding for that?	2000-04-12

But I like Emily a lot better - she seems like a real person, somehow, unlike Anne, which was nice in her own way, but never seemed like a real person. I think this is  the best book in the series, because the author hadn't been committed to a  certain set of characters yet, and can develop them freely.	1999-08-23

AS a CS student, we had this book reccommnded for our data structures and our algorithms design courses. It was really usefull foor the algorithms design course (although I hadn't compared it to any other book...) but I  did find a better book for the data structures course...	1999-08-09
