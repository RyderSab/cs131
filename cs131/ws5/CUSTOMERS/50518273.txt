The authors spend about 1/2 of the book describing the relationship of the 4 college roomates.....boring.   I was very disappointed.	2005-09-30

It's an easy diet to follow, you don't have to measure food, figure percentages or count calories you just avoid carbs mostly in the form of bread and sugar.  Once you have given those up for a few days, your cravings for them decrease dramatically.  Basically when you eat sugar, you body sends out Insulin to process it.  If you are used to eating alot of carbs, most likely you body produces too much insulin which results in low blood sugar a few hours later  --- and you are craving sweets again.  On this diet you can regulate your bodys insulin therefore reducing cravings and lose weight.  Your body will not burn fat as long as there are carbs in the bloodsteam.  Take a look at low fat foods and you'll often find that there is more carbs in there than the regular product.  <br />The Book<BR>You don't need to read the book to get all the info you need for this diet, you can get most of it from the website.  The book is full of tons or studies, jargon and other blah blah blah.  There are maybe 2-3 chapters that tell you everything you need to know.	2001-09-19

This was a pretty good book and a fast read.  The book has an introduction with some history about the Apache conflict and then goes into the part that is Geronimos own words, translated in the early 1900's.  The book does point out places in the text that are disputed as being the words of Geronimo.  He talks about things that happened to him as a child and as a young man.<BR>However some things that are discussed in detail in traditional history books are barely mentioned here.  There are some good pictures in the book.  It's very interesting to hear it from his point of view, but I would also recommend other sources to get the complete story from both sides.  I would compare the way the text reads to the book &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot;.	2001-09-06

This is a great collection of short stories from the Master of Horror.  My favorite was The Jaunt, which was sort of a sci-fi thriller.  The Raft was in the movie Creepshow II.  Also good were Gramma, The Myst (more like a novella at 100+ pages), Survivor Type and The Ballad of Flexible Bullet which is a story about going insane.  If you enjoyed Night Shift you'll love this.	2001-09-06

This book has everthing you would want to know about fitness.<BR>Running, cardio, weights, isometrics, nutrition, circut training, etc, etc, etc.  There are numerous interviews with friends and students of Bruce Lee, and descriptions of the methods he used to train them and himself.  I found the circut training he did to prepare for Enter The Dragon very intersting.  There is an interesting appendix in the book that tells how the author, with the help of Ted Wong recovered Bruce Lee's Marcy exercise machine and another appendix giving all of Bruce's measurements.  The best thing I took away from the book was the extreme importance of all aspects of physical fitness when it comes to defending yourself.<br />As a downside there is definitely alot of repeated material in the book.  For example a description of the bench press is probably in there 10 different times.	2001-09-06

There are different circumstances in a bear attack depending of the type of bear, whether the bear is startled or looking for a meal. This book explains eveything for you, even how to recognize the tracks of the different bears.  The author is careful not to make assumptions and speculations, but just to present known facts and conclusions.  He won't say that a certain response to a bear attack will or will not always work, but just how it has worked in the past.  I would be interested to know about Polar Bear attacks, which is not covered in the book.	2001-05-15

It covered the different types of feeders, houses and seed and tips on how to keep snakes and even worse squirrels out of  your bird feeders.  It described which birds are likely to appear during  certain months.  One thing that it did not cover was how to identify the  different types of birds by their appearance or song.  But it has  definitely sparked my interest in fostering wild birds and I plan to learn  the different types on my own!  This book is worth your time and money.	2000-05-30

It also covers the side kick, stop-hit, spinning kick and other weapons of attack.  I will say that the book can be  read in less than one hour, and that the material is not really different  than the other Fighting Method books.  I am a fan of Bruce Lee and JKD but  I wish these books had gone more in-depth.  The pictures of Bruce are worth  the price.	2000-05-30

I thought this was a great book.  The entire story takes place in about 12 hours and the book has plenty of spiders, vultures, snakes, coyotes, scorpoins, rats and whatever else might make your skin crawl. (My personal  least favorite is rats!)  The relationship the boy has with God is an  interesting twist and makes the book a true good vs. evil battle.  The way  the cop mixes the talk of the dead(Tak!) right in with being polite (Gosh,  no mamn, I wouldn't hurt you!) is great.	2000-05-24

It describes how Shamrock grew up, worked as a bouncer at 19, won 2 or 3 toughman contests and went on to be a submissions and NHB champion.  The  second part of the book is better, which describes the training the Lion's  Den fighters must go through.	2000-04-21

You will be able to read this book in an hour or less.  There are only about 100 pages with lots of photos.  What's in the book is good, but like another reviewer said I would have liked for the book to be more in depth.   The material in the book was good and offered some ideas on how to build  your speed and power, and explains how important being fit is to defending  yourself.	2000-04-21

Like a few other reviewers, I thought there were a couple of scenes  in the book that were totally inappropriate. I still give the book 5  stars.  It was very interesting with the idea that IT appears as what  everything you are afraid of.  The descriptions of the characters as  children is amazing, you will in your minds eye see your own childhood  friends as the faces of the characters.  The way you read about how they  encountered IT as children and as adults at the same time is pretty  exiting.  READ IT!	2000-04-21

It also has alot of problems that are more specific to the outdoors, like information about the different tick-borne diseases, snake  bites, etc.  Read it all the way through or just use it as a reference, it  s avery helpful book.	2000-04-21

I am involved with a  classical style, but after reading this book I cannot motivate my self to  train there.  I feel like it is a waste of my time and money.<br />The book is  a collection of notes and drawings that were assembled afters Lee's death.   It reads like several hundred paragraphs instead of a book, but it is still  good.  Lee includes alot of philosophy and Buddist ideas in the book, it's  not all techniques.	2000-04-21

This book is even shorter than it looks, about half of the pages are illustrations.  It is a very good story that jumps right into the action and stays there.  The book is actually pretty scary and the movie version  (&quot;Silver Bullet&quot;) is as good as the book.  If you think King  takes to long to get going, this is the book for you!	2000-02-28

This is a very funny book about 2 forty-something out of shape men who set out on the Appalachian trail.  Bryson's hiking buddy Katz and the characters they meet on the trail are hilarious. Just because they didn't  hike the whole trial, doesn't mean he can't write a good book. READ IT, you  won't be disappointed!	2000-02-25

There is a lot less character development, it just jumps right into the story.  Some people will probably like that, since some of his books take 300 pages for the  action to start happening. It's a good book with a great ending.  The movie  is pretty good as well.	2000-02-25

It has more action than some of his books and it's very scary. Just when you think you have figured out what will happen next,  something  totally unexpected does.  If you are a King fan or just enjoy a good scare,  read 'Salem's Lot!	2000-02-20

They all start in the middle of the action, and then explain later how they got there.  All of the stories are great and many have been  made into movies.

There is a photo of each breed (black and white). The best thing is at the top of each page all of the info you want to know is broken down in categories.  How are they with  kids, guarding, energy, size, who that breed is recommended for and who it  is not.  This book is definitely worth the price.  It is a lot better than  some of the $60 books about dog breeds.  You'll get you moneys worth.	2000-02-20

I got this book to complete the series, but I  don't really like to read a bunch of recipes, but someday I might.	2000-02-20

Each story is excellent, very scary and like other reviewers I found &quot;1408&quot; a  lot like &quot;The Shining&quot;.  &quot;Lunch in the Gotham Cafe&quot;  will have you thinking &quot;Gee!

This was an excellent account of Sioux history from a Native American point of view.  I read this book in 2 days it is very interesting and easy to read.  I agree with another review who liked the fact that they poked  fun at themselves and the  soldiers.  The visions are very descriptive.  Black Elk was involved in most of the well known historical points for the  Sioux.	1999-12-20

The Pigeon river, east fork, south fork, Shining Rock Wilderness, Brevard  and Grandfather Mountain are all real places in western NC.<br />Ok, I had to  say that since being from this area made the book even better.  This is one  of the best books I have read.  I was given this book as a gift and I  thought it might be a romance novel but it's actually not.  It's almost  like a collection of shorter stories that make up a great adventure.  I  recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading.	1999-12-13
