But the story it contains holds great promise especially with the 2nd book to be published late this year, early next (Cast in Courtlight).  <br /> <br />The heroine was once a young lass who lived in Nighshade fife and she has always felt that she barely escaped with her life. For she was the only child to live of those who woke with tattoos one morning. Now 7 years late someone is killing tattooed children again.  <br /> <br />Kaylin, is now a member of the Hawks... part of a Triad law enforcement agency and nothing but human or so she seems. But unlike most humans in a society ruled by immortals she has magic, and its power is growing... There are those who fear her enought to suggest she be put to death before the meaning of the killings comes to light. <br /> <br />The author has created a interesting fantasy world and I look foward to the next book!	2005-09-17

The books is a take off of one of the stories from David Weber's Colletion of Bolo stories entitled \\"BOLO!\\" and I found it a decent read. <br /> <br />Captain M is a wounded Bolo commander and would like nothing better than to have died with her Bolo... But soldiers sometimes aren't given a choice and she is sent off to defend a secret mission to establish a colony where hopefully the Dog Boys won't find it. <br /> <br />But unfortunately things don't go according to plan and the enemy does find them. To make a long story short, victory while costly doesn't destroy the colony... But it does give Captain M a much longer lease on life as a Bolo commander...  <br /> <br />I found this book to a good deal better than the previous effort by Weber's Bolo! Definately a good read if you like David Weber and Bolo's!	2005-09-17

This book is all from the perspective of a FreeHold Special Forces Operative and is a wonderfully written view of the Freehold Military.    Starting out with Ken Chinran as he signs up for basic and works his way up though basic foot soldier to top level special forces operative, how he and his crew had their fun and survived while kicking ass, all the while getting ready for the mission of their live.    In the end Ken and his crew end up on Earth as sleeper teams ready to do the most damage to infrastructure of Earth when they attack Freehold. And a bloody marvelous job they do as well. This book highlights what the Few, the Proud and the Brave can do when called on, even being stuck in the middle of enemy territory.     On the flip side of this story, the author is providing a grim view into a future that might be if the world buys into the United Nations as a whole. The mediocrity and the striving to be average that is used to keep everyone the same and in their place. The overwhelming concern for rules and regulations makes one want to puke.     I definitely enjoyed this story and look forward to further FreeHold novels.	2005-08-08

Watch on the Rhine gets back in to the yellow-gore splatter of the Posleen war. While the previous books where set in the USA, this book is set in Germany.  <br /> <br />The Chancler of Germany has seen how bad its going to get and in spite of all the left-wing, tree hugging self-rightous socialistic little commie bastards realizes that there are times you just need to fight evil with evil. Thus those of the dreaded SS that still live are rejuved and put in command of fresh young cannon fodder and told to kill all of the Posleen you can.  <br /> <br />While this is a war story this is a certain amount of human interest story, mental side-trips dealing the characters reactions to the rejuved SS and the war in general. <br /> <br />On the whole I find the book a faithful followup to the previous books of the series. Rather a good read!	2005-08-03

My perception of her was that she was being really childish and being a bit \\"small\\" as it where. <br /> <br />I'm very pleased to report that the author has turn out a superb novel this go round and it is a interesting and twisted read, sure to keep one interested. The story is interesting and has a timely message that definitely makes one think. Our favorite charters at there're best, I think and I'm sure you'll be pleased. <br /> <br />I found the villain(s)/victim(s) to be wonderfully portrayed and I felt Dallas while being her charming self, definitely showed signs of growth in character unlike the previous book. I personally found the \\"gift\\" scene to be a heartfelt moment.  <br /> <br />I whole-heartedly recommend this book and definitely look forward to the next! <br />	2005-07-14

A darn good read	Well this is definitely better than Doc Travis's two book. I found this to be a darn entertain'n read boys and girls! Definitely one for the collection. There are of course the parts of the book I would have done differently, but JR manages to pull off yet another great yarn. <br /> <br />I especially liked the StarShip Troopers reference and I'm sure you will too once you read the tail and figure out what its all about. This tale has it all science experiment gone terribly wrong, alien invasion, allies and back-stabbers, new tech showcased, and a possible sequel hinted at, another good read from Baen Publishing. <br /> <br />I do appreciate the authors realism as opposed to Doc Travis. Yes, I'm a proud American, but even I don't think the boys in uniform are gonna kick those nasty aliens back off planet without a single lose... Something Doc Travis for all his enjoyable tails needs to take to heart.  <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this, pretty darn good!	2005-05-17

No noticeable errors, its just that the plot line is a little bit dry, flat if you will. <br /> <br />I found on a whole that all our favorite characters have returned and are acting like we expect them too. There where some new additional characters that give promise, but we'll have to wait for the next book to see if their still around. <br /> <br />The plot however could have used some spice and less melodrama. I found that while interesting and entertaining, the characters acted in ways that made them seem two dimensional. This is direction opposite to what the author had been intending, making his hard work go down the drain. <br /> <br />On the whole not a bad book in the series. Just not the crowned jewel.	2005-05-17

This the 5th Sookie Stackhouse book in the Southern Vampire Series seems to be nothing much more than a place holder in the series. <br /> <br />I was rather disappointed by the fact that every supernatural male seems to want Sookie. Its getting a bit old, really, doesn't some male want to kill her? Several females have tried, but no males have been serious about it, rather they seem to be appologetic. Even the villain who is supposed to kill her doesn't really want to, its more of a matter of honor for him to finish the job! <br /> <br />I was disappointed about the lack of resolution over the Sookie, defending herself in the last book, the theme drags on through the entire book and is never resolved. <br /> <br />My last issue is what looks like the lead into the Bill/Sookie/Eric love triangle, or some other combination including one of Sookie's vamps and maybe some were. This is getting a bit annoying really. These last two sentences lead me to my chief complaint... I felt bored. I wasn't engaged, the story didn't suck me and make me want to keep reading. I felt I did have to keep reading, after all I did buy the book. Wish I'd waited till it was on paperback, not that it's a bad book, its just not worth hardcover price to me. <br /> <br />On the other hand the book is seemingly error free but I read it while dealing with frequent interruptions. On the whole its not a bad story just a boring one that doesn't inspire a 2nd read. <br />	2005-05-04

A Stroke Of Midnight\\" is the fourth novel in Laurell K. Hamilton's Princess Meredith Gentry series. I advise if you haven't read the first 3 books that you do so before hand otherwise your going to get lost. <br /> <br />First of all, Yes, I did enjoy the book. There where a number of good points. Most noticeable for me at least was that the copy editing if finally getting there. To me at least the lack of errors was noticeable.  <br /> <br />The sex is hot, steamy and lusty even if some of it take place in odd places but still they could use something to make them truly pop. The Goddess is even more present than in the previous books and things are really starting to pick up. The Queen of Air and Darkness is once again doing what she does best, being disturbing. Merry has picked up some female guards and the ring plays a interesting part. There is a bit of a flat feeling to the book, at points the author seems to wonder as if she isn't sure how to fill the pages, but this can explained by stating that this is not really a book but part 2 of Merry's latest adventure.  <br /> <br />The story picks up the morning after the last book, but my chief complaint with this is that we still have NOT made it to the Seelie court yet! The first 2 books of the series where each a self-contained adventure. But the author with the previous book and this book, A Stroke of Midnight, is stringing the reader along over a long weekend and we've got at least one more book to go before this \\"weekend,\\" is over! Personally, that ticks me off cause this weekend is over a year old already!! My other complain is Merry shows a lack of leadership in my opinion. Maybe its because the Goddess is running the show, but I'd like to see some leadership! <br /> <br />On the whole this book is improved and is a enjoyable read on the whole...	2005-04-25

Soon America is under attack by the Chinese and Russians who have warp missiles of their own. Colorado gets smashed, litterly. But Clemons and crew save the day with a trick of their own and win the Warp War. <br /> <br />I do have some problems with this book even though it was an enjoyable read. First everything seems just a little to cut and dried. Victory came seemingly to easy... I don't real many spelling/gramatical errors but there where a number of sentances that should have been re-written. On the other hand it is a enjoyable little story, enjoy it for what it is, science fiction.	2005-04-01

First of all let me say this is a beautiful book. Its coffee table quality, if a bit small for that. <br /> <br />The book gives a small history of firearms, handguns and then gives a small review of safty issues and how to care for your firearm. <br /> <br />It also has serveral nice exploded diagrams of pistols & revolvers and then goes into list of the makers of pistols and revolvers and gives pictures and technical readouts for those shown. Over 400 photos in the book, nice glossy pages and clear photos. <br /> <br />A great review of pistols from 2002 and before. But at 8 dollars I couldn't let it go.

The story starts out with Steve Montana going on and on about how depressed he is, moments before the effects of the Warp War described in Warp Speed by the same author, are felt in the US of A. <br /> <br />The story does lag a bit while the hero goes on and on about being depressed. Annoying but understandable once we find out its not his fault he's so depressed. The story picks up once Steve loses his new job and is abducted by aliens. <br /> <br />Steve meets the heroine of the story on the Alien ship and together they over come the little Gray's and start learning about their technology. In short order our two heroes meet up with the W Squared crew and after some misunderstandings everyone realized that they are also on the side of the angels. <br /> <br />Now we come to what is my main beef with this story. I felt that the tech was possible and it was plausible and all that. But, the author describes the little Gray's as \\"Stupid.\\" Personally this annoyed me because they where not stupid, they where in fact brilliant. The failing of the Gray's was to fail to recognize that they where locked into a set of rules of what was and was not possible, it this reason the humans walked all over them, not because they where \\"stupid.\\" <br /> <br />Shortly we find out the little Grays aren't so nice and another secret war begins. Needless to say humans with all their aggression and willingness to do unto others before others do unto us, not to mention the fact we always seem to be at war, stand us in good stead. <br /> <br />The book ends with humans secretly recruited from earth spreading out a crossed a part of the galaxy ready to pounce on anyone who comes calling. <br /> <br />This book is an enjoyable, easy read. But the good guys (humans) win all to easily. Yes they had a new twist on technology that put them so far beyond the Grays it wasn't funny, but ZERO casualties for the humans? I was also displeased with the length of the book which is even shorter than Warp Speed, so it only lasted me a couple hours.	2005-04-01

Only problem is Roger and crew never show up, so when his brother and sister and nieces and nephews are all killed and the Empresses condition is questionable, everyone points the finger at Roger. <br /> <br />Roger on the other hand is getting a 9 month long trial by fire on the planet Marduk. The constant running combat, death and slaughter mix to burn away the gloss on his personality. No longer is Roger MacClintock worried about cloths, public opinion and what the current style is. Now Roger just wants to get home to old Earth and serve up a big dish of pain and suffering on those that so richly deserve it. <br /> <br />In this book. Roger with help from friends and new allies smuggles himself and his marines onto new Earth where they setup a restaurant that serves Mardukian food minus pink basik of course. (basik being the Mardukian rabbit, which humans seem to resemble in some fashion.) <br /> <br />Roger is about to show the galaxy why you never pock with a MacClintock.  <br /> <br />I could not put this book down.

The story of Kendra Pacelli and her friends, the Earth she knows, the true home she comes to find off world after America is no longer the land of the free and the home of the brave.     This was a very touching story that sent shivers up and down my spine with a glimpse at a possible future. A future that if you know where to look even now just might be a possibility. Earth in this future is a over crowded hell-hole unless your rich. America has bought lock, stock and barrel the ideology of the United Nations. It is no longer the home of free. It is instead corrupt, over-crowded and \\"freedom and justice\\" is available only to those who are the new rich socialists.    Our Heroine Kendra Pacelli leaves Earth for the world called Freehold. It is on Freehold she finds happiness and love and realizes all the lies that have been told over by the U.N. to the billions of humans back on earth. For on Freehold there is more than enough for everyone. Sure you have to pay or take it out in trade or work out some kind of arrangement, but if you want it you can get it, you can earn it without being filthy rich.    The truth of this story come out when the U.N. decides that Freehold needs to be under Earth's control for its \\"Own Good.\\" The vastly out number Freeholders fight a Gorilla style war, while non-combatants and prisoners of war are raped, murdered and tortured by the soldiers of the U.N. In the end its only by drastic measures, the threat of extinction of all live on Earth that forces the U.N. to back down all the while spouting their sanctimonious B.S.    The author. Michael Z. Williamson, has created a story that is both fictional and prophetic and I look forward to the next book in the Freehold Universe!!!	2005-03-21

What I found distracting was that the villains where too shadowy that they didn't appear all that much in the story. Eve Dallas was always reacting to what she found they had done. The villains should have been much more central to the story. <br /> <br />I did however greatly enjoy little Nixie and found her adorable and Eve and Roarke's interaction with her was equally amusing.  <br /> <br />Even though Eve is her abrasive self I think there where hints of personal growth in the story. The author's vision of Roarke was skilled as always. But I do think that Eve came off looking a little small in the grand scheme of things. While I can understand Eve maintaining her \\"public\\" hardass face, I see very little growth at home. She is still almost as difficult as when they first met and married. I look forward to Robb pushing this side of Eve Dallas. On the whole the story is a enjoyable read. <br />	2005-02-10

David Weber makes the introduction of a new band of characters in his latest spin-off series from his masterpiece the Honor Herrington series. Weber once again revisits the role of the single star-ship captain. Much as in the days of the sailing navy when frigates patrolled the seas and made port calls at distant colonial holdings, so does the captain of a solo starship. <br /> <br />In this new series Weber takes a brake from the Manticorian-Peep conflict, instead telling a story of a captain haunted by the past and a young tough crew facing off against the shadowy maneuverings of an old and unpleasant enemy. This series takes far from the boarders of Manticore so it brings home once again the flavor of the old sailing days when a captain was a captain-under-God (This is the say the captain was the highest ranking authority till the ship got home). <br /> <br />The Crew of the \\"Nasty Kitty\\" as the HMS Hexapuma is affectionately known is a mix of a few (Ginger Lewis, Aubrey Wanderman, Helen Zilwicki and Abigail Hearns) familiar faces and many new and fresh characters to know and love. Tasked with bringing a new cluster of planets into the Manticorian Star Kingdome, a haunted captain and his crew will show once again why the RMN is the best in the galaxy! <br />	2005-01-17

Taking part in a rebellion in the works for Centuries, Aly is at her best teaching the Raka how to use their resources and planning assaults on key targets, it is here her unusual education comes into play.  <br /> <br />This is a fun book to read for any age person. I started reading these books while looking for something for a young cousin who has gone onto buy the rest of these books for herself. This book is a real page turner, filled with battles, intrigues, humor and romance. I heartily recommend this book and the preceding book in the Aly series. <br />	2005-01-17

In this set of books, Ms. Pierce continues her Tortall series by introducing a new heroine Daine.

Taking place between the Song of the Lioness series and The Protector of the Small series, Daine's adventures cover everything from falling in love to fighting battles.

Peabody takes the detective exam so be sure and read the book and find out whats going to happen with that! This is a great book! Definately worth the reading time even if your don't regularly read J.D. Robb.<br />The reader is presented with the normal cast of returning characters. What makes this book interesting to me beyond the great story is this is the second book since the author changed her tone of writing. It is my belief that the first 15 books with the much gritier and grimmer writing style gives the reader a glimps into the soul of Lt. Eve Dallas as it where. In latest 2 books the writing style as lighted considerably. Not to say Dallas is any less of a great cop or that her personality has been changed by the author. No its more as if some of the deep mental wounds have been healed to an extent that while Dallas is still a hardass she's enjoying living more.<br />Another great Lt. Eve Dallas mystery, definately worth the read!	2003-09-06

I failed the exam the first time after studying Mike Meyers book, it was way to easy. The second book I purchased was the Exam Cram2 book, even easier than Mike Meyers book and I could tell that by the time I had read seven chapters. I simply put the book down and asked around.<br />This is the book that was recommended to me as the ONLY book to use to pass the Security+ exam. It doesn not candy coat how hard the exam is. It tells you in detail what you need to know to pass the exam. It will tell you you don't need to know this to pass the exam...BUT you should know this for the real world. <br />Pay attention to the exam alerts and warnings. Trust me they will give you a great idea of what to expect. In my opinion the DVD that comes with this book is worthless, its the book you want!!<br />I can't say enough about this exam. While it could use a little editing in my opinion. Some of the paragraphs where a little long winded, it does cover unlike other books in extream detail what you need to know. Non of the other 2 books I read covered what this book takes forgranted as the &quot;normal&quot; information you need to know! <br />CompTIA's Security+ exam is not a easy exam like the A+ and Net+ which in my opinion are used to grade first year IT persons.  This exam expects you to know in detail and to be able to figure out situations and how to fix them. This book provides the book knowledge and also points you in the direction you need to go to figure out the situational questions.<br />This book is definately worth the read IF you want to pass!!

There where a number of enjoyable stories in this collection, but also a number which I personally didn't carefore.<br />BiFrost Crossing by Barry B. Longyear: Is a short story about a soldier in the future who has ended up in the psych ward because he is having flashbacks, it is from these flashbacks that we learn what is going on. (A little strange but interesting.)<br />Faith On Ice by James H. Cobb: Personally Mr. Cobb is one of my favorite authors and he doesn't disappoint in this short story. Set on the Antartic Ice in about 100 years, a skimmer pilot keeps the faith and goes to find two missing fellow soldiers. (A very good little tail, perhaps a glimps of a future series by the author.)<br />Sparks in a Cold War by Kristine Kathryn Rusch: A story about a hunting expedition to a forbidden planet gone wrong. (Strange but interesting.)<br />Los Ninos by William H Keith Jr: A tail about humanity attacking a weaker species for political and econmoic reason. And the soldiers reactions to this and in particular one tough female marine when confronted with the truth. (Interesting and thought compelling, a good read.)<br />An Admiral's Obession by Kathrine M. Massie-Ferch: The story of a woman who is now only a Admiral in the navy, who once was the crowned princess to a now over-turned throne. A woman who will do anything to protect her home. (A great story.)<br />Ranger by Bill Fawcett: A rather funny little tale once you've read it and thought it over. In the age of non-leathal weapons how you teach someone that they are not beyound the reach of the US Military. (A great story.)<br />The Vaction by Ron Collins: Two old biddies take a vaction to a world that without Terrian support would have been crushed by the enemy. (A so so story.)<br />On the Surface by Robert J. Sawyer: If you liked H.J. Well's \\"The Time Machine\\" This story is a spring off from that idea. (Didn't care for it)<br />Air Infantry by R. J. Pineiro: Earth has been invaded, and now the humans have figured out how to finish off the last of the invaders. (A intersting story.)<br />Toy Soldiers by Robin Wayne Bailey: A great little read about a \\"Super weapon\\" gone wrong. (Neat little story.)<br />Most of the stories in this collection I would call decent to great, but the ones I didn't enjoy I really didn't like at all. Pick it up fore yourself if you enjoy any of these authors. A Decent read all in all.	2003-04-21

Its almost as if it was written to finish off a contract or just to give the author another book out there. Don't get me wrong the writting is fine and all, but the storyline is rather flatline. Nothing really exciting or dangerous happens, we just observe a lot of politics, family interaction and fleet movements.

This book is the 3rd in a series, the first 2 being, &quot;March Upcountry&quot; and &quot;March to the Sea.&quot; This book and the series in general are a good+ read, but they are not a great read. Why? For David Weber fan's you just have to buy the book and read it, but I'm sure you'll what I did. 75% of this book and 100% of the last two books contained the effort of our heros to get to the star port so they can get off the primitive planet they are stranded on. And in the space of 2.75 book the battles to get to said space port get just a little bit old after a while! <br />This book is written in Weber's wonderful style, yet the overal number of battles contained with the pages of the 3 books of the series to this point make the reader want to cry enought!! For David Weber Fan's I would say read the book. But for those who haven't had the pleasure of reading Webers other wonderful works I would suggest that this isn't the series to start with.	2003-04-09

I personally really enjoed this book/series very much!! <br />A brand new Enforcer, a tough-guy vampire hunter, a renegade vampire, a run-away teenager, a FBI agent are all heading toward Seattle, and they are all looking for each other. <br />Two relucant partners; one who has been told to kill the other, the other is more than willing to kill the first, find they have a bigger problem. Something is growing in Seattle, something vampires are not allowed to fight no matter what. <br />A great job by Susan Sizemore!! Definately worth the reading time!!	2003-04-09

This has to be my favorite of the series so far! \\"Laws of the Blood: Companions\\" is a great read! Selena Crawford is a Chicago Homicide Detective, she is also a non-magical member of a gypse family, she also happens to be the personal property of the head Enforcer in the USA. \\"Steve\\" and Selena rub each other the wrong way...well maybe its the right way all the time, when their not fighting of course.<br />Vampire Politics mingled with the possibility of an extreamly rare pregnacy make for a wonderfully twisted and exciting read! It is Definately Worth reading this book and this series!...	2003-04-09

This is a good book, but thats as far as I'll go with it, I can safely say I didn't love this book. This is the second book in this series by David Weber, and it picks up right where the first book left off. While the book is written in Weber's easy to read-never-bores-the-reader style, this book just has TOO many battles. Usually one wouldn't complain about reading a well written fight. But this book and the series in general has just way to many battles. While in principle the battles are well and good in the theme of the story...to the reader it gets to be a bit much. For Weber fan's in general I would recomend this book and series, but for the those who haven't had the pleasure of reading Weber before, this is not the Weber book to start with.	2003-04-09

I'll say I enjoyed this book as David Weber is a wonderful writer, but I didn't love this book. Why? While the plot which continues on for 2 more books and isn't yet finished, is a great plot, goal of the main characters is to get to a space port to get off a planet. And it takes them 2.75 books to get to said space port!!!! There are a LOT of battle scenes and while Weber writes great battle scenes, there are TOO many battle scenes which just stretches the whole series out over a great many pages!!!! On whole this book is a decent read, and worth the time if you are a David Weber Fan.	2003-04-09

Susan Sizemore has come up with a great new twist on vampires in general. The first in a series of 4 to this date, \\"The Hunt,\\" is set in L.A.<BR>  <BR>Selim is a Enforcer, there is one per city and it is the Enforcer who decides when there is a hunt and who is to be hunted. But lately the vampires in L.A. are really twitchy, they feel that Selim has been slacking on the job. Enforcers are not normal vampires... Whats more scary to a baby vampire? A 1000 yr old vampire or a Enforcer? Hands down, the Enforcer. <br />Enforcers are Judge, Jury and Executioner in their city. But what happens when there are three Enforcers in the same city? <br />A romping good read, definately worth the time to get caught up on this series!!! Loved it!	2003-04-09

To tell the truth it was the cover that caught my attention as I was browsing though the new books at the local library. I then sat down to blow through the first few chapters to figure out if the book was worth checking out. Well needless to say, I sat there in the libary till closing time!<br />Leda Hubbard has been obsessed with being a Egyptologist and joining a dig. The navy being the only way Leda can get her PHD, which she finally gets in forensic anthropology, but still can't find a dig that will take her, Until she recieves a mysterious invatation to work with a man named Chimera. Not one to look the gift horse in the mouth Leda heads of to Egypt. <br />Our heroine, Leda, is one for always getting in trouble, for the right reasons of course. But in the end, her reward is something beyound anything she ever imagined as a young woman dreaming of Egypt.<br />This is a book that is definately worth the reading time!!	2003-04-02

Ms. Hamilton has done a wonderful job on this book!! I picked this book up after work, got home and read it non-stop and finished in under 5 hours!! I'm sure you'll love it!!!<br />Why I liked this book... Vampire politics is always interesting to say the least, add into the mix a murder mystery, a good dose of unease all around as the full moon is coming (when isn't it?). A load of erotic tensions, a menage a trois and new critters. Well thats just part of what makes this book the latest and greatest of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series!!!<br />Jean-Claude and Anita must find a way to save Asher from Belle Morte, who is out for revenge upon Jean-Claude and Asher. Anita finds out that she does actually love her vampires even though she tries not to. A hitman wants to hire Anita to do a annimation, and Dolph needs a vacation bad before he goes over the line! And Anita learns that she still can be afraid of the dark when the Mother of all Vampires lets Anita know that she really isn't sleeping, just waiting for something \\"interesting\\" to come along, and that she finds Anita fascinating.<br />The world of Anita Blade is a dangerous, exciting and twisted one. It is the very fact that this \\"Anitaverse\\" is lightyears distant from our own, yet right around the corner at the same time, is what makes the Anita Blade series such a wonderful read!This book was definately worth the reading time!!	2003-04-02

This is a great book! I must say that this book didn't let the intensity change as often seems to happen in the 2nd book of a trilogy! While this book starts off a bit slower than the first. Mara of the Acoma isn't in quiet a tight a situation when the book starts out. She has proved her metal in the great game.<br />As the intensity ramps up, we are informed with great skill on the part of the authors to several key situations to the storyline. And then as if unlocking a brake, the story takes off in a situation that give Mara the chance to make great changes, at the same time bringing her face to face with her family's long time foe.<br />Again, I can't say enought about this trilogy! Its very well written, the authors portray the culture, the attitudes of the people, the class struction, this new world they have created with great skill. If you enjoyed Raymond E. Feist's Krondor series then I am sure you will enjoy this story as well of a woman who while a lady uses her mind and the soldiers of her house for the good of her house, and of the Empire as whole!	2003-03-30

Personally, I have enjoyed the Worlds of Honor series, but I do find them less enjoyable than the regular Honor Herrington Series. Why? Well despite David Weber's picking great authors and all they aren't writing in a universe they thought up. Sure there is hardship, courage, honor, highs and lows, as in all stories but for me some of the story's don't have that extra edge that makes me want to re-read them. But all in all this is a book worth reading. <br />\\"The Service of the Sword\\" can stand alone on its own, what it does is gives you a peak at different asspects of some of the characters we have grown to love and others we are just now meeting for the first time.<br />We once again meet the brother of the Queen of Manticore, on his middy cruse. It is on his first cruise in the navy he meets a young woman escaping from her captures, fighting to return home to Greyson, in Jane Lindskskold's \\"Promised Land.\\" <br />In \\"With One Stone\\" Honor Herrington escapes what could be her end, without every knowing that a young junior officer who is loyal to his captain, gives her ship the chance to escape. We are also given a view into the world of Admiral Himphill, in this work by Tmothy Zahn.<br />John Ringo and Victor Mitchell give us a tongue in cheek tail about where all the Greyson screwups go. Its a very short, funny story about where Siberia is in a modern space navy.<br />\\"Let's Go to Prague\\" by John Ringo is a great romp about two Manticorian Marines/ONI operatives who get bored and tired of the beer on one planet and trapes halfway acrossed the sector to another world for fun. The one thing your never sure of is, are these two screwups or pro's who are so bored their getting slopping in a effort to make things more fun!!<br />Personally I really disliked Eric Flint's \\"The Fanatic\\" so I personally really don't have anything to say about it other than it was my least favorite story in the entire book and wouldn't have cried a tear if it had been cut totally out!<br />Lastly David Weber, gives us the story \\"The Service of the Sword,\\" in which we are reintroduced to Abigail Herns. If you remember Ms. Herns is the first Greyson woman to join the navy, not only that but she is the youngest daughter of Steadholder Herns. And the preasure on her to perform is intense. As a teenage Ms. Herns observed Honor Herringtons defense of Greyson and has ever since wanted to join the navy. Now for herself she will experience the price of command.<br />All in all this is a very nice book to add to your David Weber/Honorverse collection. It was a great read, well worth the time and the cost of the book!!	2003-03-30

I love this book and the other two in the trilogy! Daughter of the empire has it all. Action, suspense, intrige and shows the hand of two very great Fantasy authors! I can't say enought about this book and its trilogy. If you enjoy the Raymond E. Feist's Krondor series this is a book/trilogy you don't want to miss!!<br />The book starts out with the heroine assuming control of her badly damaged noble house. From there she must fight for survival. She must use her head, her enemy's are powerful, her resources very limited. Yet she is willing to risk all, and her daring, her willness to break with tradition that binds many of her foes is blessed many times over.<br />Mara, Lady of the Acoma in her own fashion is a woman such as James H. Cobb's Amanda Lee Garrett, or David Weber's Honor Herrington. She is a woman who knows that being a woman can give her the advantage when the foe thinks she will respond as a man would. Daughter of the Empire is definately worth the reading time and the cost of the book! It has a proud and lasting place in my library, I'm sure it will in yours as well!!	2003-03-30

This book can be read very well on its own. But if you want the full impact of the story its best to have read at least the first 4 or so books of the Krondor series. I personally really enjoyed this tale, one of pirates, sailing ships, dragons and wizards, of far away places and exotic personalities. <br />Raymond E. Feist brings to life once again his beloved Krondor on the pages before you very eyes and spins us a brandnew tale of young prince Nikki and the adventures he and his friends have as they rescue their friends, make new ones, gain lands and defeat enemy with a cunning plan.<br />In these pages we gain new glimpses of old friends and make new ones as the pages turn! I can safely say that this is one book of the Krondor series that you don't want to miss. Definately well worth the reading time!	2003-03-30

This book is a continuation of the story started in \\"Aliens vs. Predator: Prey\\" But unfortunately the author tried to cram to much into the number of pages in the book. We get some interesting insights into what it was like for Machiko to run with a pack of Preditors for several years. The story then bottoms out for a while and appears to be dying quickly. The author then presents us with the situation of the Aliens are being upgraded by humans to be used as weapons. The author gets Machiko to the planet where this is happening, from there the story such as it is does improve a good deal. The Preditor's show up and Machiko is now able to communicate with because of her robotic sparing partner's unnoticed \\"upgrades,\\" where she explains the problem and works to clean it up with the help of the Predator's.<br />All in all its a middle of the road read. If you really enjoyed the first book about Machiko its probably worth reading just toget the full story such as it is. But other than that it was pretty predictable.	2003-03-30

This is not one of those trilogys that ends with a flopp at the very end! No, Sir!!<br />Mara of the Acoma is about to take her greatest gamble with the death of the old Emperor. To place her own son upon the throne will not only secure her family from all foes, but will enable her to make changes to the way the Empire does business. Yet, in this, the goal that has been forever in her mind as ruling Lady of the Acoma will come the greatest risk.<br />But she has allies in unexpected places, for if Mara wins she will shatter old treaties that have bound the alien Cho-ja against much that is their right. Foes of old will block her way, and new foes with power beyond measure will be threatened by what Mara intends to do. Yet there is hope for Mara, for Heaven itself may infact be on her side.<br />This is book/trilogy is a must have for any serious Fantasy/Sci-fi collection!! Raymond E.

If you love the Serrano/Suiza series this is a must have! This sets up all the history, the muder, the mystery, the politics and the past battles so that once we introduce Esmay Suiza into the circles of the Serrano navel family we know exactly where Heris Serrano has been. If you've read the books that center around Esmay Suiza, you definately need to read this book, it will give you a much clearer picture of what all is going on in the Regents Familia. This 3 books in 1 will also give you a window into why Admiral Serrano treats Suzia the way she does... SO all in all its definately worth the reading time and the cost of the book!!	2003-03-29

I'd say this is the second worst book of the series, but it wasn't as bad as Rules of Engagement, yet it is in need of some serious help. I'd say that this book did have a lot more promise than the one previously mentioned, but it got lost some where in all the extra stuff that the author was trying to stuff into the book without making it look like she was doing so. So what we end up with is a bunch of little stories and sections of ideas that get lost in the overall theme of the book and contribute to the reader feeling lost and wondering why they purchased the book.	2003-03-29

But we are still left hanging at the end!! This author has a bad habit of writing endings that while assure us of our favorite charcter's current status leave us hanging for the long term. While this series did have promise and was entertaining, I can't help but feel it was an attempt by the author to compete with David Weber's Honor Herrington series. It is an attempt that failed on two fronts. One the author is no where near the same caliber as Weber when it comes to writing about battles, tactics and military personel and politics. Second the author tries to make stage much of her story on character drama and and skip on the tatics of war, at the same time creating a drama that in several of her stories brings the general flow of the story to a screaming halt! I'd say this book is worth the reading time and the price of the book if only to finish off the series. But on the other hand the book itself is pretty good. But as a whole i'm disappointed with the series as several of the books just seemed to shoot the guts right out of it...or shoot it off at the legs whichever you prefere.	2003-03-29

While at a medium pitch the intensity soon climbs toward the roof, the author keeps us guessing and boy do we enjoy it! Nicole is in for a rough ride, first she gets her ship shot out from beneather her, contacts the first non-humans ever found, and then blows up the pirates and their very well funded base, who blew up her ship.

But unfortunately you'll probably have to read it so you know whats going on latter in the series. Personally I found the book a bit over done. It could have been shorted by 100 pages or so and still gotten the same effect. The idea that you can kidnap the \\"prime minister's\\" daughter, gang rape her, and then use her for breeding and not expect to have the a whole pile of trouble coming down on your planet is rediculous. The villians are something out of the 1960-1970's and are just plan moronic. I also find it difficult to believe that if inhabitable planets are becoming in rather short supply that you let a bunch of crazy's keep a perfect one to themselves when your military would find it a walk in the park to disarm said crazy's and use the planet for your population! I enjoy Elizabeth Moon's work, but this is one book that should have had a wee bit more editing!	2003-03-29

While the pace of this book is a bit slower, than the first book in the series, it is definately worth the read. Lanen and her husband are on the run, this time its humans and demons that are the danger rather than dragons. Yet there is exciting things happending to both the greater and lesser kindred as well!!

What makes this book worth reading is the that we are able to follow the lives of Damia's children as well as the rest of the extended family. For me that is always what made this series worth reading was the family's dedication to each other in-spite of their egos and talents. This 4th book in a series of 5 Lyon's Pride by Anne McCaffrey is set in the universe we have come to expect of her Talents series. The story continues on with Humanity and it's Allies continued fight against the hivers. There are several subplots that are set up or carried along for conclusion in the 5th book. But it is worth the read if you like this series, and McCaffrey in general.	2003-03-26

It is still one of the very best of any book he has ever written, I also feel it is one of the true, \\"New Classics\\" in science fiction. Weber is is a Tom Clancy of science fiction and his books are worth every moment spend in reading there pages. This is a book you will not be able to put down!...<br />Weber gives us three special \\"woman\\" in his creation of \\"Fury\\" Alicia the human \\"Special Forcess\\" type soldier who has lost everything that she holds dear. Tisiphone, a immortal creature of spirit from ancient greece, alone, a orphan in the distant future of man where her name is nothing more than a fading legend from the shadows of earth's past. Megarea a creature of logic circuits and computer code, she never-the-less is selfaware and as protector and daugher/sister to Alicia will do anything to help her gain revenge for the lose she has suffered. <br />This is Weber space opera at its very finest! Battle tactics, character development and storyline are all handled with Weber's impecable attention to detail. My appreciation for the author's skill grows with each time I read another author. Mr. Weber handles the Techonology of his \\"Universe\\" with great skill. We always understand what he is talking about yet he never needs a encyclopedia of space and technical terms to tell us all he wants us to know. This is a book that is DEFINATELY worth reading!...	2003-03-26

If humanity fails there will be no chance for the stars, victory will bring a wonderous collection of technology from the future and the chance for humanity jump into the star with a technologal edge that will make them unstopable! David Weber once again desplay's his superior writing talent.

I'd read several other David Weber Books and was hooked on him as a author before I ever read a single Honor Herrington book. Finally I perchased \\"War of Honor\\" with the cd-rom included. Which had all 10 David Weber books (including War of Honor on it), I then read all the books. I think the book itself is around a 4 rather than a 5, but if you picked up edition that includes the cd-rom I'm sure you'll vote its worth a 5 star count. This book to me while it is a bit slow and has a lot of politics is setting up the stage for future books in the Honor Herrington Series. While its not the most exciting book there are a number of rather fasted paced sections. This book is more important in reguards to the political changes taking place both in Manticore and Haven. This is a must read for those who enjoy David Weber's writing and especially the Honor Herrington series!!!	2003-03-20

Not only are these three orignal books now in one large nice hardcover some of David Weber's very best writting, they are in one book! These are the stories (these 3 books) that got me hooked on David Weber and his writing style. For those of you who many not have read any of his works, Weber's writing is full of details, but the action and adventure never stop. The detail rich storylines provide that you'll never be bored! You'll always understand what he is talking about (you won't have to figure it what he's trying to tell you), he explains the technology of his story lines in crips clean sentances that while aren't baby talk don't make you look around for a dictionary for scientists!!

Cobb's opening salvo &quot;Choosers of the Slain&quot; is a exciting fast paced book that has the makings of a classic. The author has a very tight, colorful and descriptive writing style. He does not leave you trying to figure out what is happening. He tells you right down to the smallest detail, but never ever bores you! You can smell the sea salt in the air. Feel the icy cold of the Antartic wind, and hear the missles coming hot off the rails! You'll feel as if your on the bridge or the CIC looking over the should of Captain Amanda Garrett. Mr. Cobb's Characters aren't gun-crazy or looking for a fight, but if one comes their way, they'll be the ones to finish it.	2003-03-20

Cobb's Latest offering of the life and actions of Amanda Garrett, takes a series of S-turns with this latest installment. The central character enjoyes a flirtation with a fantasy from her childhood days and takes a dip on the other side of the line, the darkside so to speak. Explored in the pages of this book is the question of what happens when a Officer and a Lady, sperated from her crew and command, offered the taste of forbidden fruit in the guise of childhood &quot;crush&quot;, will she accept what is offered or be true to her calling. Those that say that Cobb's latest installment couldn't have been written by someone who truely knows the armed services give them selves away to be men, not able to put themselves in the place of a woman. Nor are they able to invision what might have to be done by a woman, to survive till rescue comes.<br />This is a worthy effort on the part of the author. I give it a 4 our of 5 stars because I felt that there was a bit of drag in places that could have been polished out by the author. I look forward to seeing more Amanda Garrett works in the near future!	2003-03-15

This second tale in the adventures of Princess Meredith is one of secrets, sheet ripping sex and personal growth. <br />In this, the second installment of the tales of a princess of farie we learn more of the backgrounds of some of our favorite characters. We learn who they were, where they've been and what they've lost. But we still haven't learned the whole story. Hamilton keeps us in suspence and yet fills in parts of the picture.<br />The sex keeps getting better for Merry, but there are things out there killing/hunting. While most might find this book a bit slower than the first, the reader would do well to pay attention and read between the lines. <br />Meredith is beginning to realize what it is to truely be queen. She is realizing that there are going to be sacrifices to be made and choices that she is not going to enjoy. But she is also becoming more sure of herself in that she is willing to make those sacrifices to insure she will be a queen with power and not just a queen in name. <br />All in all a wonderful read, with details that begin to give us a glimmer of the world of Farie, and of things to come!	2002-03-27

I could barely hold still while reading it! I was reading so fast, I had to force myself to slow down so that I could savor every word and sensation. She has out done herself!! Now then I admit that the story need a bit more in places. The mystery was to easy, the plot a little lose in places. But, this book i think will be key in where Anita's life goes next. Now lets be honest for all of you who seem to love Richard and Edward so much. <br />First of all we finally start the process of getting rid of Richard. Why its taken this long for Anita to finally get rid of the weak is beyound me. Oh Richard is a werewolf and very strong for it. But when push comes to shove its Anita that always has to give him the will to fight and sometimes even live. Even though after this book Antia still isn't as strong (physically) as Richard she's begun to realize, maybe for the first time that she doesn't need Richard to protect the pack. <br />Edward. Our friend Edward is probably still more willing to kill than Anita, but Anita can now survive things that Edward couldn't. But don't let that confuse you to as to Anita's willingness to Kill, she's just slightly more picky than Eddy is. Edward is a direction that Anita could have gone, a might have been, a possibility, but nothing more. In many ways Anita is beyound Edward in ways he can't begin to understand.<br />This book is a turning point, Anita is finally beginning to accept what she is and what she must do to survive. Slowly but surely the human mentality that she was rasied with is giving way to a thought process that is less human but still very recognizeable to us.	2001-11-20
