US	32913141	R1F9SPDDD3CS47	0939009013	32452185	Ranger Mosby	Books	2	4	5	N	N	Interesting man, horrible narrative	As another reviewer mentioned, the telling of the Mosby story is done so awfully.  I could not finish the book because I was not able to get into a rhythm (keep in mind I read about 3-4 books a month).  Parts where you're expecting to have details he summarizes in broad strokes, meanwhile in other places pages and pages are spent on meaningless points. <br /> <br />I gave the book two stars because when the narrative is good (in a few places) it is very good and you learn some interesting facts.  There are also some excellent photos/illustrations. <br /> <br />Other than that, I just got done watching a Civil War Journal episode done on Mosby and it pretty much summed up much more effectively what Virgil took about 300 pages doing.  It doesn't look like there is a solid bio out there, other than his own memoirs.  I should have started their in the first place.	2005-05-17
US	32913141	RKLKN5HKHA7OF	0395597722	912323148	Pickett's Charge	Books	5	5	6	N	N	What an enjoyable read	Stewart has an excellent style to his story telling.  It's sort of like your grand pa is relaying the story to you while you get warmed up near the fire place. <br /> <br />A handful of well drawn maps help with some of the visuals and his short segment style allow the reader to start and stop according to their schedule without worrying about losing their place. <br /> <br />The meat of the piece is once Armistead and select Pettigrew units cross the Emmitsburg Road and hit \\"The Angle.\\"  The slaughter is horrific and Stewart captures it quite well.  He also does a great job explaining casualty rates and what most likely caused them (i.e. rifles, artillery (long and short range), etc.)  I know that some of the info is a bit outdated and things like men killed, wounded, or exactly where certain troops were positioned have recently been benefited with new information.  But still, you have to admire Stewart for the gathering of info at the time. <br /> <br />I've just started reading Hess's Pickett's Charge book and quite frankly that is a home run.  The level of detail is amazing and I would say it is the more scholarly of the two.  However, I still give Stewart's book 5 stars because it has excellent information and is told in such a friendly way.  It is a very quick read as well for when you need a refresher or maybe are heading to the battlefield.  I'd highly recommend reading the book any time you visit the field (even if you're a civil war novice) and the walk the ground keeping in mind all that you read.  You will then understand what is meant by courage.	2005-01-14
US	32913141	R3N8US4EXYWRF8	080781749X	686578884	Gettysburg--The Second Day (Civil War America)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Excellent	Pfanz is the champion of Day 2 at Gettysburg.  Although his First Day treatment was very good, he excels with the focus on the Day 2 action. <br /> <br />The action is very detailed and certainly not for a newbie.  Definitely read a good one volume account of the entire battle first (maybe even read it twice). <br /> <br />Many will claim that the meat and the potatoes of the battle of GB is on the second day, particularly in the area of The Peach Orchard, Wheatfield, and Little Round Top.  Longstreet called it \\"the best three hours of fighting\\" and I tend to agree. <br /> <br />Pfanz does an excellent job of setting up the different regimental, brigade, divison, and corps leaders who were in charge of these certain subsections of the fight, along with providing some grunt reports to present a complete picture.  Of course the book is meticulously footnoted and you will not doubt his knowledge on the subject.   <br /> <br />Movements and phases of battle tend to overlap.  The Wheatfield is probably one of the most complex actiions to understand because of the involvement of 2 different Confederate divisions and at least 3 different Union corps, not to mention the ebb and flow of battle.  Pfanz handles this action superbly. <br /> <br />Little Round Top, although not as complex a movement, has potential to become magnified in importance and to actual events.  However, Pfanz relies of meticulous research and tempers any far flung notions, but simply presents the events as they happen.  Well done. <br /> <br />Pfanz is not a big Sickle's fan.  Most would agree with him.  I'd like to have seen a more neutral stance or at least present the counter argument, but that's okay.  When it comes to Sickles, you can write a book alone about his decision to move his corps forward.   <br /> <br />There are several maps.  The complex action might require a more thorough set if you really want to break down the details.  I'd suggest getting a copy of Imhoff's Day Two A Study in Maps.It's an excellent source of about 50 beautiful maps covering all the Day 2 action.  Reading Pfanz and comparing against Imhoff's maps is the perfect one two punch you'll ever come across. <br /> <br />Simiply put, if you are student of the battle of gettysburb, your bookshelf is extremely incomplete without a copy of The Second Day, and his other book on the Culp's Hill and Cemetary Hill part of the field.  Skip his First Day book and go with Martin there who has written the definitive account.	2005-01-05
US	32913141	R2PUPWFNFIUMOK	0306812401	12796708	Gettysburg July 1	Books	5	22	24	N	N	Excellent	This book is soooooo good.  I read Pfanz Day One and Martin's July 1st back to back, and without a doubt, Martin gets the nod.  Pfanz book is wonderful, don't get me wrong, but it reads too matter of factly and there weren't as many of the analytical remarks I was expecting.  However, Martin provides many more details, but also a lot of the analytical questions and answers that makes reading about the battles interesting.    Maps are excellent and numerous.  As usual, a few more wouldn't have hurt, but I'm happy with the ones they had.    I read the \\"revised\\" version so I had no troubles with the editorial mistakes like some others.  Just make sure you get the revised copy.    The flow of battle is a little tricky to handle because you have multiple troop movements, engagements, important orders going on at the same exact time.  Martin's style is to stick with one \\"action\\" all the way through.  For instance, the action at Barlow's Knoll leads to Kryz's moving in reenforcements, which leads to Union retreat on the right, which leads to Coster's stand, etc.  Then he goes back and handles the entire action of Pender's action which was happening at about the same time.  I prefer the style that jumps around from section to section so you can read the actions in a chronological order, but Martin handles his style quite well.    Simiply put, the amount of research, details, and nuggets of info (i.e. stories of valor, etc.) are excellent and well worth the price, and make an excellent addition to your civil war book shelf and most certainly your GB collection.  This book is for the more advanced student, so beginners are better off starting with an entire campaign or battle book (like Trudeau or Sears) before tackling the micro study.	2004-12-23
US	32913141	R191L5ZRH6WV5H	0807826243	998807154	Gettysburg--The First Day (Civil War America)	Books	4	12	14	N	N	Very Good, but there's another one better	Normally I would have given Pfanz's First Day a hearty 5 stars.  His knowledge of GB is astounding.  However, I believe, after reading Pfanz and then Martin's July 1st book back to back, that Martin comes up on top.      Sometimes, two books on the same subject work very well together as far as offering different view points, style, etc.  But in this case, I found Martin's book a better, more thorough, more analytical, and more detailed recounting of the battle of day 1.  I am sure that I will re-read Martin many times, but I don't think I ever need to reread Pfanz's First Day because Martin covers it better.    Again, there is nothing wrong with Pfanz's book and it is a great read.  However, the only advantage over Martin's is that Pfanz's is about a couple hundred pages shorter.  Therefore it's a quicker read and a little more concentrated with info.  Martin has a lot of \\"as previously noted\\" type comments.    In short, I like to have a big Civil War library, so I bought both books, but if you're looking to save money, you can get away with just Martin. Either book is for the more experienced student of Gettysburg, so don't start your general interest here or you'll be lost in the details.  I'd recommend Trudeau as a good overall campaign start, then go to the micro studies of particular days or actions (i.e. Little Round Top, Wheatfield, Culps Hill, etc.)    Also, there's a couple of minor errors on one or two of the first maps which kind of turned me off.  I love the summary of actions at the bottom of the maps, but why no state designation for the units (i.e. 26th North Carolina is noted simply as 26)	2004-12-23
US	32913141	R25NGX6AUEV8RH	0380002930	498635851	Watership Down	Books	4	0	0	N	N	recently revisited	I remembered this book from 5th grade reading.  Someone mentioned it to me recently, so I went back and revisited it after over 20 years.  I read it over a 24 hour period. <br /> <br />The story reads like a very long bed time story, very exciting and thrilling.  The most exciting part of the book is the last third in my opinion, but most of the book is fascinating.  In today's age of short attention span, it's hard to feel the tension of rabbit squaring up against a rat, so things need to be put in perspective.  But, the author definitely gets points for the metaphors and symbolism of the various rabbit warrens and what they mean to a human society.  Also, a wonderful good vs. evil showdown in the end. <br /> <br />As a pure story, it is very exciting and worth a read.  From the point of view of a literary masterpiece, I do not think I could go that far.  Other than a handful of characters (which are developed nicely), there isn't much development on the sub characters.  Many of the transitions are abrupt, the dialogue is sometimes redundant, The narrators POV constantly changes from 3rd person Hazel, to Omniscient, to third person Bigwig. <br /> <br />Adam's is a wonderful story teller.  His strengths are concept, orginality, and adventure.  The book is perfect for a 9-16 year old and maybe for some old timers looking to be nostalgic.  Also recommend the movie if you liked the book.	2004-10-18
US	32913141	R29Q0Y8JYW7XO1	0060931868	220335700	Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Awesome	In judging all civil war campaign books (and obviously Gettysburg specific) I believe for most people, the standard is Coddington.  At least as far as the one volume treatments go.  IMO, Trudeau's book is as close to Codd's and in many cases even better.  I have read about 25 ACW books so far this year (yes you read that correctly) and so far, this ranks in the top 3.<br />Here are my reasons:<br />1) Publishers seem not to understand the importance of maps in complicated actions.  You may now rest in peace.  This book features map upon map, in timely locations, and showing you the pertinent action.  True, a couple of them are almost microscopic, but I will not fault for giving them to us.  I'd rather use a magnifying glass, then turn the battle into a jumble beause of all the different units.  Maps get 5* ++++<br />2) Commentary.  Very neutral and well paced.  True it can be a bit dry, but I like the flow.  I like the short sequences and jumping around from place to place to show you what exactly is going on at that very moment elsewhere.  Codd's is more analytical, describing possible reasons, pros and cons, etc. for the movements, but there's nothing wrong with Trudeau's.  A different, more generic style.  Very friendly to newbies.  More of a pure telling of what exactly happened and not so much why it happened.<br />3) Bibliography is tremendous.  Although there are not specific notations (more of a general wrap up in the back of sources referenced for each chapter), in many cases, there are traditional footnote mentions to clarify terminology or what appear to be contradictions.  Also, something I haven't seen elsewhere, during certain actions, he notes soldiers who won medal of honors for their service that day.<br />In short, this is a must read for GB fans and I would highly recommend as your first campaign read (whether it be for GB or just in general).  This should become the new standard on how to write (and map) a book on a civil war campaign.  Coddington, for me, still holds the edge, but just barely because of its thought provoking prose style.  I think both books work well together.<br />To simplify, Coddington gives you more of the strategic/analytical blow by blow, Trudeau gives you a lot more detail, many regimental accounts.	2004-06-30
US	32913141	R3BWSAD4DB2VVP	0618344195	865873587	Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Pretty Good	It is typical Sears in style.  There is more detail here however, than in the others I've read from him.  Definitely more regimental accounts.  Maps are also more detailed than his Peninsula treatment, although they sometimes cover a large time frame with multiple movements and countermovements.<br />He clearly has his views of McClellan and that sometimes gets in the way of the story telling, but I have no issues with this.  I subscribe to the thought.  Those who want a pure telling of action may be turned off by the slant.<br />South Mountain and Harper's Ferry is a bit rushed, but you get the basics.  I also felt the Bloody Lane narrative wasn't as strong as the cornfield, but was decent enough.  The bread and butter of the work is definitely the northern action involving Hooker, Mansfield and Jackson.  There is a good mix of reporting, recounting, etc.  You'll get excerpts from soldier's letters, notes from the OR, after thoughts from the key generals' memoirs.<br />A very nice read overall.  Very much recommended.  One can only wish that a Coddington type treatment is out there, coming soon for this much deserved battle.  Until then, I think Sears is a good replacement which gets you about 75% there.	2004-06-28
US	32913141	RILP5QGQ7LHTV	080613187X	604477713	Return to Bull Run: The Campaign and Battle of Second Manassas	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Excellent	Most people have said it already, but this really is the standard of campaign study.  I won't go as far as saying it's as great as Coddington's Gburg work, but Return to Bull Run is 97% there.<br />My few little quibbles are:<br />1) with the maps, which although numerous, very timely and well placed, can be a bit cluttered when brigades/divisions/etc are placed on top of roads, rivers, cities.  Basically, the area is not cleared out, but rather the block is placed right on top.  It takes a little getting used to but at the first few glances looks like mixing up letters in a scrabble bag.  <br />2)the background leading into the campaign was a little rushed, imo.  I now realize that 2nd Manassas was a very complex battle with several skirmishes and engagements leading into the actual battle.  I suspect to spend another 40-50 pages on &quot;the build up&quot; probably would have made this book gigantic beyond what it already is.  Not a big hassle if you're well informed on the 7 Days and Cedar Mountain battles and the circumstances as to why the armies found each other where they first did, but it would have been nice to have gotten a little more depth (similar to Coddington covering Chancellorsville, restructuring of the armies, etc.  Afterall, the first 2/5 of Codd's book does not even touch on Gburg)<br />3) it could be that I was in a bad mood when I first started the book, but the initial 75 pages or so seemed to be &quot;thicker&quot; reading than the rest of the book.  Sort of like a term paperish style.  I found myself re-reading several passages because I lost my place or didn't grasp the point.<br />That being said, the book really is brilliant.  No one will doubt Hennessy's knowledge and to my delight, his writing style opened up and became a breeze to read.  To his credit, something he was able to do which Coddington did not do often is cover many regimental level actions.  They are described in great detail and very easy to follow.  For this he gets the5 stars (otherwise maybe a 4.5)<br />Most of the information is presented in a very neutral, matter of fact way.  There is a bit of opionated tone with McClellan, but that is clearly understandable.  I like his explaining of the various controversies.  After all, that's what most intermediate and advanced students of ACW like to talk about.  We like to question the what ifs and what went wrongs, and Hennessy does a great job of defining what these topics of discussion should be.<br />I read this immediately after reading Sear's To the gates of Richmond.  So comparing apples and oranges here, Hennessy might do just a little bit better job of injecting a little life in his writing, but no doubt his knowledge of the subject separates him from an author who writes about a subject rather than lives and breathes it.  You'll notice I gave Sears 4 Stars, while this clearly gets 5.<br />Bravo.  Please bring your talents to other campaigns.	2004-06-22
US	32913141	R1X1G84LY2OWF0	0306812673	647305880	These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Insightful	The author raises some very good questions and points.  His focus does drift away from Gburg from time to time and covers more of the myths of the overall war.    The book is actually somewhat heart breaking for us students of the ACW because you walk away realizing that many of the accounts of the war you may have read are not necessarily entirely factual.  Again, the point of the book is to explore the myths and in doing so the author asks many questions.  Unfortunately there are not many answers, although many of the key points are put to rest (i.e. Gburg for shoes, \\"Historicus\\", etc.)    There was something missing from the book that doesn't allow me to give it a better rating, and I'm not quite sure what it is.  It is a little scatter brained and redundant at certain points.  Another pass from an editor would have helped.  There is also a somewhat half-assed attempted to psycho analyze some of the motivation behind the embellishments/straight out lying, etc. that was a bit elementary, and quite frankly presumptuous.  But most of all, I think the book needs to be re-organized.  There should have been a \\"top ten\\" of sorts, myth #1 Shoes, myth #2 Ewell controversy, myth #3 Longstreet controversy, myth #4 Sicles controversy, etc.  I have the feeling that the book was on the short side, and things were added and restated to beef it up.  The writing almost would have worked better as a series of articles in a ACW or history mag.    That being said, it is very insightful and for that it gets my 3/maybe 3.5 star rating.  Not for the novice, I think you are better reading a treatment of the battle, at least to help you understand why men would lie/exaggerate their reports.  The biggest surprise of course is the heroic stand of the 20th Maine which gets toned down to realistic proportions and brings Chamberlin back to earth.    In short, good reading overall, but could use the touch of a better editor, and less preaching.	2004-06-07
US	32913141	R3AA4BGOVUAMBQ	0060934778	192826396	Covered with Glory: The 26th North Carolina Infantry at the Battle of Gettysburg	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Excellent	The narrow focus of what the 26th is most famous for is wonderful because it allows for many details.  For those that don't know, they took atrocious casulaties over a 48 hour period, basically 8 out of 10 men went down.  Their action is legendary, lining up against the Union's most famous, Iron Brigade, and also being the unit that could claim the farthest penetration into enemy territory on day 3.<br />As always, a couple of more maps would have been extremely helpful, but that being said, the ones there are well done.<br />Day 1 is treated extremely well with intense description of the action, almost minute by minute as far the 26th was concerned.  The reading is smooth however, and most won't get lost in the details.<br />Day 3 has some of the best coverage that I have read because the author expands the focus for the Picket-Pettigrew-Trimble Charge to cover many of the other units involved.  Of course, the 26th still gets the lions share of the commentary.<br />This book isn't for novices, but at the same time, you don't need to be a hardcore student to get it.  I think a simple 2 or 3 page synopses of the battle will help so you don't get bogged down with some of the names, but more so you understand the importance of the battle in an overall perspective.<br />Again, the focus is the 26th at Gettysburg with a very brief prelude and wrap up to their other action.  Highly recommended for the ACW afficionada and casual reader.<br />My only little quibble is with the quality of paper and tiny font for the paperback.  Come on publishers, put the better works on better paper so they'll last longer.	2004-06-07

I plan on reading his Antietam treatment as well now that he has passed my test.<br />The story is told in a very easy to follow narrative.  There is some strategic/tactical analysis, but is mostly a tale of what happened where and when from a high level and some very nice quotes from the lowly private to round out the presentation.<br />I hold Coddington's Gburg study as the daddy of all campaign studies and use it to gauge other books.  Sears does a great job, but not quite a 5* one.  He misses a little bit of the depth and his commentary is skewed in some places, although not as bad as some have commented.<br />The movements are mostly covered from a corps level, frequent divisional details, occasional brigade, and very little regimental.  I suppose that is a good mix for a casual reader.  Someone looking for some extra details might be a little disappointed.  The maps are often and excellent.  Again though, most do not show much unit detail, there are a couple of exceptions (i.e. Gaines Mill and Malvern Hill Southern Brigade positions)<br />Thre are a couple of other books on the subject, and someday I hope to get to them so that I may compare.  Until then, I'm fairly confident in saying that Sears has done very good work and most will walk away satisified.	2004-05-26

"Stonewall" Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign, Spring 1862	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Awesome	I'm only about 1/3 through, but I can tell that this is an awesome piece of work.  I'm surprised not to see  more feedback here.<br />Tanner does an excellent job of presenting the Confederate deatils of the early valley campaign.  He gives an excellent quick history of the valley as far as original colonization, American Revolution tie-ins, etc.  He also paints a good picture of the strategic importance of the valley.  So far reading, I'm surprised that more action did not take place within the 2 mountain ranges that make this &quot;valley.&quot;<br />Tanner covers every level of the campaigns from simple private, to captains, to regimental colonels, to brigadier generals, all the way up to division commanders and of course General Jackson.  Detailed troop movements are given, yet I did not find myself lost in details.  Maps are excellent and numerous.<br />Also, very important, is reference to other Eastern developments which caused the ebb and flow in the Valley.  You get the details as to why certain troops found themselves headed in or out of the valley, especially for the Union side.<br />The writing is very clear, concise, and at times very poetic.  I wouldn't say Tanner is another Catton or Foote, but he comes pretty darn close.  Much better than a typical dry account of campaigns you usually see out there.<br />I've been doing a lot of reading on ACW lately.  I wasn't quite sure whether to read this because there seemed to be so many other more important works out there.  But I'm glad I'm reading it as Tanner does an excellent job of briging this often forgot and vital campaign to life.<br />Remember it is Jackson's brilliance in the campaign which delays McCellan from striking Richmond by causing panic in Washington and delaying troop concentrations, and more importantly, it is his superiority in the Valley which allows him to break loose and help kick off the 7 Days (although he was MIA in helping).<br />Any serious ACW student should read this book.	2004-05-03

At 225 pages, about 20 of those dedicated to maps and photos, and a big font, you can pretty much zip through this book.<br />The treatment is kept very simple.  It does go down to regimental level in many occasions, but it certainly is not minute by minute accounting.  And it's not just about Corps and Division commanders.  You get a lot of Colonels and Captains, and even some wity lines of observation from a private or two.<br />The maps are actually well done, a bit better for the union side of things though as they seemed to have kept better order in their regiment and brigade groupings.  You'll see specifics mentioned on the union, but only &quot;mingled Confederates&quot; on the other side.<br />I'm a big fan of Shelby Footes and Bruce Catton, so I could see where a lot of the material is drawn from.  That being said, the author does a pretty good job of pulling together several sources and giving an above average Civil War enthusiast an interesting read.<br />The author asks and answers several of the key questions and controversies, and provides some back ground info of why the battle of Shiloh was fought and its impact on the overall war.<br />I'd highly recommend before reading Sword or any other more detailed account.  It's basically the intermediate treatment of this classic battle.	2004-04-27

What you will find is a detailed study of the Gettysburg battle and the several weeks that surround the prelude and aftermath.  It is presented in a very clear, easy to read format.  There are no down in the ditch stories, so what you're left with is a blue print of troop movements, logistics, strategy choices, decisions, and repurcusions, some character studies and arguments against many of the classic what if scenarios.<br />I think it serves your best interest to read a quick synopsis of the battle before tackling this book.  Although I didn't find it as complex as a couple of others have noted, having a basic understanding of &quot;the fish hook&quot; and the major players involved (at least corps leaders) will make this a much easier read.<br />The battle details are well done and not overly complex.  The strength lies in the analysis of the decisions made during the campaign.  In some cases they are big decisions, in other cases they are on a micro scale.  In all cases, Coddington does an excellent job of injecting logic, based on the known facts, to put to rest many controversies.<br />The maps are excellent, but as always with military books, just a few more would have helped make an even clearer picture.<br />I see myself re-reading this book every year or so just to keep up with my facts and it will definitely accompany me when I visit the battlefield.	2004-03-23

You definitely need to have a working knowledge of the battles that the Army of Tennessee was engaged in.<br />The focus is on the political and ego wranglings between Bragg (later Johnston and Hood) and his staff, and then the wranglings with Richmond and key political figures.<br />In other words, you don't get a lot of such and such regiment moved here and such and such regiment moved there.  It is more a critique of the leadership decisions.  There are some battle details, but you're best off having a good understanding before you undertake this book.<br />The treatment is very fair to Bragg, I felt overly so, but Connely does back up his opinions.  He comes down on Johnston and Hood for lack of a clear plan.<br />This is not a book about the overall war in the west.  Just as the title says, it's specifically about the AOT.  You hardly ever hear about Vicksburg, Mobile, Iuka, etc. other than to note troop concentrations and shufflings.<br />In short, an excellent read for the more advanced civil war student.  I'll confess I probably read this and Army of the Heartland a little prematurely and much of the information went over my head.  I will re-read once I feel up to par with the high quality level of information.	2004-03-17

You will walk away having learned pretty much everything there is to know about fighting for the CSA.<br />I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I started reading as far as style went.  I wasn't sure if it would read like a memoir or rather collection of memoirs.  The style was actually more along the lines of a research paper.  It's a very nuts and bolts portrayal of every day camp life with each chapter focusing on a certain element (Why, Who, How, etc.).  You don't get the pit in your stomach or wind in your hair sort of sensation, but you do get a very accurate read of the life and times of those soldiers.<br />If you're looking for more of a &quot;romantic&quot; or spirited read, I think you'll be disappointed.  You're probably better off going with a true memoir.  &quot;The Life of Johnny Reb&quot; does not read like a story or memoir.  What's great about it is that each chapter stands on its own, so it would be easy to pick up and read from time to time.<br />In any case, as I mentioned the research is impecable and clearly after reading I can say that I understand the common soldier of the CSA.	2004-02-17

I'm a new student to the ACW, but new enough to still know that NBF is one of the more intriquing characters of the war.  I thought I did my research well and picked the right book to read about him by choosing \\"That Devil Forrest.\\"<br />Well, I'm a little disappointed.  Not because the book is bad, but more because it wasn't what I quite expected and mostly because I read it out of place (more later on this).  The focus is 95% on the military side, which is not all bad.  After all, that's what makes him the wizard of the saddle.  But the problem is I found the account very dry at times.  Much of it is rehashing Official Records and what others have said in their memoirs.  I never got the feeling of being there, in the middle of the battle, with bullets zipping by my ear.  The only way I can describe it is a very nuts and bolts reading of what troops went where and what troops did what, with a little bit of prose thrown in.  Certain chapters are handled better than others, but from time to time I found myself drifting away from engagement to engagement because there wasn't much to make it unique.<br />Now, I realize not every one can write like Catton or Foote, but considering Wyeth did ride in Forrest's cavalry, I was hoping for a little more from that POV.<br />As far as the details of the engagements, they are extremely well done.  Clearly you will walk away from this book understanding how many casualties he infliced, what companies and who their leaders were who rode on particular missions, etc.  It is truly a micro history and if you are unfamiliar with the bigger battles that may have intiated NBF's specific participation (i.e. Shiloh, Murfressboro, etc.) you might get a little lost in the details.<br />I think I need to read more of a true biography first, and then follow up with \\"That Devil Forrest\\" to fill in the military details.  That would make a very good one two punch.<br />So, in short, if you're fascinated by Forrest, but know little of him, I wouldn't start with this book.  I think you'll get lost in the details.   However, if you have a thorough understanding of the ACW and good back ground info on Forrest the man, I think you'll find this book a good compliment if you're after the details.  Another high point is the footnotes and references are impecable.  Although the author has a very clear biased opinion about his feelings toward Forrest, he does back up the numbers so to speak.	2004-02-09
US	32913141	R3XBXCDO5T3FZ	0345422473	947191478	Gods and Generals: A Novel of the Civil War (Civil War Trilogy)	Books	3	2	6	N	N	Above average	I was going to try and not draw comparison's with &quot;The Killer Angels,&quot; but the fact of the matter is that Gods and Generals isn't as great as it's touted to be.<br />The usual excuse given is that it covers too large a time frame and too many battles, whereas his father's work with Killer Angels was focused on Gettsyburg and that week or so around it.  Valid point.  However, the writing of G&amp;G is par at best.  It has nothing to do with the time frame or amount of battles.  I think he spends a little too much time in the prelude to war and then when it actually gets to the &quot;good part&quot; (the battles) it seems rushed.  Antietam is hardly mentioned.  The fight in the cornfield could have been the high point of the book just as the battle for round top was a high point in Killer Angels.<br />Simply put, G&amp;G doesn't have that one poignant chapter that you can hang your hat on.  I suppose the death of Jackson and assault on Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg give the best shot at this.  However, as I mentioned, the writing is par, maybe above par at best.  I've read better descriptions of the emotions, pain, confusion and horror by many non fiction authors (Foote and Catton to name just a couple).<br />That being said.  If you are totally un-informed about the civil war and your knowledge of it is basically what you learned in high school, then you may find the book a little more fascinating.  Basically because you don't have the knowledge to fill in the blanks and can make these leaps of time and place to keep up with the author.  But once you've studied the real drama of Antietam, Manassas, 2nd Manassas, even the 7 days, it's tough to swallow.<br />And for the record, I read G&amp;G before Killer Angels.  So it's not like I was looking back with a tainted eye.  In fact, after hearing all the great remarks of G&amp;G, I was a little disappointed.  It almost prevented me from reading Killer Angels.  However, the reputation of KA, the fact that itwon the Pulitzer, and many more highly tauted remarks drew me back in.  If you don't believe me and haven't read KA, try reading the first 10 pages and you'll see what I mean about the difference in writing quality.	2004-01-30

I was so lucky to be able to pick up a great condition trilogy of the AOP (Mr. Lincoln's Army, Glory Road, and Stillness at Appomatox).<br />Catton's style is so amazing.  You get the broad strokes of tactical movement, political wranglings, down in the ditch tales, camp life, and of course the human equation.<br />Excellent.  Excellent.  Excellent.<br />I must say, I'm glad I had a little working knowledge of the ACW before reading.  He does have a tendency to just start up.  For instance, Lincoln's Army starts in the middle of 2nd Manassas, then kind of works back into a flash back and fills in some of the bios.  This may be a little confusing for an un-informed reader.  You may want to read a very general, one volume sort of history before moving on to Catton.<br />The good thing though is the book is suitable for a beginner and yet I think the more you know about the ACW, the more you will enjoy it.  There are so many great little stories about politicians, soldiers, officers, etc.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-30

Having a little background on ACW helps, but is not necessary.  Shaara does an excellent job of introducing the characters and of course describing the action.<br />The book centers around the battle of Gettysburg, primarily day two and the battle for the round top.  I've been doing a lot of non fiction reading of the civil war lately, and this fiction piece was a wonderful breath of fresh air.  Reading history can get a little stale at times because it boils down to spewing facts.  What Shaara has done is brought the characters of history to life (with some creative license of course).  You begin to see their personality rather than just the orders they gave.  His treatment of Longstreet and Chamberlain is brilliant with a strong showing from Lee, Pickett, Hancock and others.<br />I was a little disappointed with Gods and Generals, but luckily Killer Angels had a wonderful reputation so I decided to read it.  I'm so glad I did.<br />Highly recommended for general readers and for students of the ACW.  Especially for the latter.  Of course you have to detach yourself from all the facts because Shaara does twist them a little bit, but he paints the picture on a personal level (rather than troop movements, tactical positioning, etc.) for what it must have been like during those 3 days in Gettysburg.	2004-01-30

I will go on to read dozens of more books on people, places, battles, politics.  The &quot;sorrow&quot; lies in the fact that the journey has come to an end.<br />I'm an avid reader, so it took me about 2 months to finish the approximate 3000 pages.  I look forward to reading it again in a few years, when I want a little refresher.  I suspect that a work like this will probably take most people several months, if not years to finish.  In any case, it's well worth it.<br />The amount of detail is perfect.  The major engagements get full treatment, down to brigade and in some cases regimental levels.  But no stone is left unturned.  Minor skirmishes and rear guard activity are also noted.  The west, the east, the naval battles.  The focus is primarily military, however, there is a nice dose of political, social, biographical and cultural topics.  Tons of anecdotes and &quot;I did not know that&quot; type information.  There is also a good balance of tactical vs. down in the ditch accounts.<br />Very good maps.  Just as the details of troop movements start to get a bit hazey, you turn the page to find a perfect map.  I would have like to seen just a few more, but there are plenty and all well done.<br />There are a few comments from other reviewers about Foote's allegiance to the South and leaving out atrocities and such.  This is hogwash.  I knew very little of the ACW before reading these volumes and I feel that his treatment was very fair to both sides.  A poor leader is critized, whether he wore blue or gray/butternut.  Just as a good leader is praised.  Grierson's raid during Vicksburg gets as many high marks as any of Forrest's.<br />Many others have noted all the highlights, much more articulated than I ever could, so I'll refer you to those reviews.  Simply put, this book is a must read to begin or expand your knowledge of the ACW.  It took 20 years for Foote to finish, and literally every word was well thought out.  It ranks in many &quot;top 100&quot; lists for best nonfiction of the 1900's.good leader is praised.

I believe I would have been much more happy had I purchased Brimson's &quot;Every where we go&quot; instead of Barmy Army.<br />I was looking for a down and dirty tale of hooliganism as I am a major football fan and have been interested in that fanatic angle.  I did enough research to know that that &quot;thug&quot; book was probably more fiction than non, so I ended up with the right author, but not the right book.<br />Barmy Army reads like a magazine article or high school term paper.  Although there are several mentions of high profile incidents, I never got inside the hooligan's head, even though there are several chapeters with headings (Who? Why? etc.)  Again, more my fault than the author.  I get the feeling though that he has milked this subject matter for all its worth as there was a lot of &quot;...as I mentioned in my best selling book, Every Where We Go&quot; and &quot;You'll have to read England, my England if you want that story...&quot; type comments.<br />Again, if you're looking for a behind the scenes account, Barmy Army has a few incidents of this, but the focus is to analyze hooliganism and try to draw some rationale for it.  You won't find much of that first person account of action, reasoning, conflict, obervations, etc.	2003-12-23

I am an avid reader (about one book a week) and this certainly ranks near the top of what I've read this year.  I was first turned on to the general subject after reading &quot;The Worst Journey in the World,&quot; the story of Scott's ill fated South Pole expedition.  Although I found that book a little long winded, there was no doubting the passion, courage, and emotions of the setting.<br />I found Lansing's book to be a very easy read mixing just the right amount of detail and back story.  Although you do not get a good picture of all 27 survivors, you do get a strong picture of the dozen or so key men.  That would be the only fault in this narrative, but I suppose there are other sources to get the whole shabang.  I would have like to have seen a &quot;where are they now&quot; sort of afterword, but nonetheless, the story is a solid, adventurous, unbelievable exhibit of man against nature and will against calamity.<br />The story is very easy to follow.  It has perhaps one of the greatest opening lines to a book ever &quot;The order to abandon ship was given at 5:00 p.m.&quot;  It is a real page turner.<br />Highly recommended reading.  I don't think I will ever utter the words &quot;I'm freezing&quot; or &quot;I'm starving&quot; again. <br />Also, you must rent/buy the Enurance DVD narrated by Liam Neeson.  This is an amazing DVD.  Besides the beautiful tale that Lansing has brough to us, the only thing more amazing is to see the actual pictures and movie footage taken by Hurley (one of the survivors).  Some of the shots are simply breathtaking.  The DVD is the cherry on top.	2003-12-22

If you find the CIA fascinating, then this is a must read.  In fact, if you find your country fascinating, you must read this book.<br />This isn't your typical James Bond, Tom Clancy sort of thing.  Get the real stories in just about the perfect amount of detail.  The characters are easy to follow and the scenarios do not require a history refresher course to delve into.<br />The &quot;Four&quot; who did dare are all geniuses and each has played a part in making sure you sleep well at night.  Each person is handled deftly and the book follows in a natural chronological order.  <br />The most fascinating part of the book definitely revolves around the Kennedy administration and Bay of Pigs fiasco.  Once again, the politics of politics can turn something so clear into a mess.<br />The best part of the book is that it handles bigger and smaller points equally well.  There are many, oh by the way type quick tales, but the larger campaigns are also handled extremely well.  You will find yourself paraphrasing stories and anecdotes from this book to your friends.  Great after dinner discussion stuff.<br />Top of my list for recommendation.	2003-12-05

I knew nothing of the true story, so I found every twist and turn very entertaining.  It is well written and doesn't get too bogged down in gritty detail.  I read about 2-3 books a month and this ranks near the top of ones I've read in 2003.<br />The story is very interesting, but the strength is in it's characters.  Whitey, Flemmi, Connolly, etc. all have their moments.  I found myself many times thinking to myself, I cannot believe this.  But it's true, scary in fact.  It has all the elements of a great movie, and I'm surprised that it hasn't been adapted already.  It has Scorsese all over it.<br />The authors give you a good taste of life in South Boston and of course expose a criminal decade or two that was aided by the FBI.  This isn't conspiracy theory stuff, btw.  Agents in the FBI protected their star informants, giving them tips, covering up information, that allowed them to stay on the street and supposedly bust others.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-04

I was more interested in reading about &quot;The Great Escape,&quot; which is covered in this book since it took place at the camp.  However, it is only mentioned in a chapter or two.<br />Nonetheless, the book covers the span of most of WWII.  There are great tales of prisoner life.  Very detailed with regards to the German POW system and how Allied prisoners lived.<br />It reads more like a term paper and not so much like an adventure story.  Sort of like you're watching a history channel special on &quot;German POW camps.&quot;  So if you're looking for a story, I don't think you'll be happy with this.  It's more a research piece.  The author gives you glimpses into the procedures, day to day life, etc.<br />Every facet of camp life is covered and for that, he gets excellent marks.  Details about food, contraband, holidays, leisure activities, building the camps, administration of the camps, etc. etc.  It's all here.  There are some tales about the actual prisoners.  But I don't think this is the book's strong point.  It excels in the nuts and bolts of POW camps and POW life, however does not delve too deeply into their stories.	2003-12-04

It certainly reads real.  I found it to be a great follow up to \\"Black Mass.\\"  There is a wonderful chapter or two about Whitey's character that are not touched upon in Black Mass.  IOW, it gives some of the characters talked about in that book more of a personal touch, rather than an outside journalistic approach.  For that reason, I found the book very interesting.  Also, because the book is very current, it includes many updates to the cast of characters (Flemmi, Connoly Bulger, etc.)<br />As for Eddie's trials and tribulations; he is definitely blunt.  There is no attempt to spin his stories.  Much of the carnage he does is simply for the fact of doing it.  You don't have that sense of Italian mafiosi creed of \\"we only mess with the people who mess with us.\\"  Eddie details racially-driven and gay bashing missions.  There are some great character development stories in the beginning and towards the end.  If the author has accomplished anything it has been to define himself and what he stands for.<br />If you're looking for a true street soldier piece, I think many others have been done better.  Simply because many of the people chronicled ended up having a higher role in the organization later on and could provide the tales from both view points.  \\"Wise Guy\\" is the all time classic (the movie Goodfellas is based on this book) and \\"Last Mafioso\\" chronicles Jimmy Fratiano's life.  These are both superb in the trenches with a mobster type reading.<br />I'd strongly recommend reading \\"Black Mass.\\"  If that interests you, then \\"Street Soldier\\" provides a nice fill in the blank type piece.  If I would have read \\"Street Soldier\\" without reading \\"Black Mass\\" first, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much (maybe 3 or 3.5 stars).<br />In the very least, it demonstrates that we all come from different walks of life.	2003-11-14

He has certainly served up much better fare with his other works.<br />The story is very formulaic and lacks the cooky characters you'd think you might encounter on a journey like this.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few odd and interesting people we meet here and there, but much of the book feels rushed.  Get picked up, drive X amount of miles, get dropped off, wait in the sun, till get picked up and repeat cycle.<br />There are some classic Horwitz one liners and oberservations but I'm not sure it warrants reading this book.  He has a car accident in the middle of his journey, ironically as he's driving himself not hitchhiking, and I wonder if this affected the whole story arc.  That's what was lacking here; a sort of purpose to the whole thing.<br />&quot;Confederates in the Attic&quot; for instance is a brilliant mix of history and social studies.  They are both handled in A+ fashion.  With &quot;One for the Road,&quot; there is some history and even less social study.  The history that is discussed is handled quite well as I learned many things.  The whole CIA/Alice Springs connection is very interesting.  The description of the towns and various climates, terrain, and settings he comes across is also handled very well.  It is probably the best feature of the book. But, the one thing missing is the people.  His interaction with people was not written about very well and in many cases felt forced (i.e. hunting down another Jew so he could celebrate Passover).  Simply put, nothing really interesting happens.<br />It's okay Tony, I forgive you.  You've gotten to be a much better writer : )	2003-11-06

Okay, I just made a horrible joke, but in all honesty I get the feeling that 200 pages could have been chopped off of this book.  I have no problem reading \\"thick\\" books, as I read this one in 4 sittings.  I now question whether I'm better off for having done so.  Honestly, if I could go back in time, I probably wouldn't read it knowing what I know now, however I do feel better off having read it.  (I know, total oxymoron)<br />There are some brilliant passages and descriptions buried here and there.  When the author is in form, it truly is captivating reading.  I can feel how cold these people were.  I can see the horrible conditions they live under and when he speaks of weather conditions getting better because it was ONLY -30 instead of -70, you really can empathize with the madness.<br />The problem is there is so much prose around these poignant moments that by the time you reach them you are still in speed reading mode.  I had to go back and re-read some of the better moments of the book because it didn't hit me at the first pass that this was \\"the good part.\\"  For instance, the whole jumping from ice berg to ice berg with Killer whales licking their chops is compelling stuff, but it is handled so lightly.  The different ways to cook a biscuit got better press.  Same with the journey that is in fact his \\"worst journey in the world\\" to retrieve Emperor penguin eggs.  He spent 90% on the set up, but then when it got to the conflict and climax (losing the tent, hurricane winds, running out of oil) this was quickly glanced over and summarized in a few pages.<br />Not only the page count, but the wording is tough going.  Is it just me, or was everyone's journal and diary entries more stylized than the next.  It was like this guy was on an expedition with Shakespeare, Tennyson and Milton.  And I don't understand the technique to spend pages setting up an event and then using a journal entry or two to restate (sometimes almost to the word) what was just written.<br />I really, really wanted to like this book.

I thought I would be reading a down and dirty tale of how people make it (i.e. reading about their emotions, their war stories, their fears, their life style, etc.)<br />It's one thing to throw on a Hawaiian shirt and flip flops and be able to fit in at a Luau themed party.  However, it's another to pretend to be poor.  Does the author really expect us to take her word because she walked in these people's shoes for a little over 2 months?  She treats being poor like a summer fling, or better yet, a summer job.  Being poor isn't an experiment.  In some cases, the shell of poverty can be generations thick.<br />The premise is a complete joke.  Work a lower wage job and try to keep a budget.  Sounds great, but here are all the asteriks:  she starts off with a nest egg and functioning car, she barely stays in one place long enough to allow residual expenses (i.e. medical, miscellaneous, car problems, etc.), and lastly, if she gets bored or rubbed the wrong way, she quits.  I got news for you lady, if 95% of us had the opportunity (and your case financial backing and real job to fall back on) to quit every time we were bored or rubbed the wrong way, we would.  And that goes for people in every tax bracket.  The difference is we are living in the real world, not conducting a fun little experiment.  We work because we have to work, whether it's for our own well being or for the support of others.<br />I did enjoy the writing and observations (that's the only reason it got 2 stars), but not in the context presented.  I found myself laughing out loud on a number of occasions, particularly the restaurant and maid chapters.  That being said, I think her approach is the problem.  If she would have approached this traditionally and simply interviewed &quot;poor people&quot; then wrote about her observations and their stories, direct from their mouths, I would have given this book 4or 5 stars.  But the fact that she tries to sell this as &quot;look at me, I was poor for 2 months, and now I'm going to tell you how bad it is.&quot;<br />If you're looking for a good read by an author who isn't afraid to get dirty and paints all sides of the fence, read &quot;Confederates in the Attic,&quot; by Tony Horwitz.  Although the subject matters are completely unrelated, it is a great example of investigative journalism that seeks to inform on a state of mind and life style.	2003-10-24

But it's a great story that has many twists and turns.<br />My only criticism is with the organization of the book. Much of the first third focuses on a character (spoiler) who ends up dying. At that point the story changes focus on two other characters, so all the story arcs have to start all over again. There's tons of details, so I imagine the nightmare in trying to organize all the overlapping details.<br />That said, it's not a big deal, and probably more of a personal preference.<br />Read this book. It really is exceptional.	2003-10-20

I some how ended up with a preview copy via a friend.  <br />Being a WWII buff, I've spent most of my reading focus on the European theatre.  Several months ago I entered the Pacific side of things by reading &quot;Ghost Soldiers.&quot;  I learned of the Japanese Bushido code, the inhumane and cruel tactics of Japanese soliders (even to their own troops), and their never say die approach to war.  Not to mention the incredible will of the US soldier.<br />&quot;The Burma Road&quot; furthered my knowledge of the Japanese war machine, but more importantly introduced me to many new characters, battles, and &quot;fun&quot; little tales about the war (i.e. air dropping fried chicken on top of starving allied troops trapped defending a hill).<br />WWII buffs will find the book fascinating and general history buffs will walk away feeling enlightened as well.  This book more than any other that I've read on war really touches upon the politics of war.  It really is a perfect mix of politics, strategy, battlefied stories, characters and various foreign cultures.<br />After reading this book, I can't believe I didn't know more about this campaign.  It truly is fascinating and there are many side stories to keep you entertained.<br />The writing is excellent.  It begins with the author trying to visit the actual road and being stopped by a sentry.  I was a little worried that the author would include himself in the story, but quickly after the intro, he focuses on the CBI campaign using very friendly historical narrative and not his bumbling adventures through the bush.  <br />Add it to your must read list.	2003-10-09

Many have pointed out some probable embellishments.  I will read the &quot;Real Bravo Two Zero&quot; once I can get my hands on it, so I'll save those opionions for then.<br />In any case, the book has its moments.  It does a little bit of every thing, unfortunately it doesn't do them well enough to make an impression.  The brief fire fights are handled hastily but his captivity is handled very well.  I primarily read this book to get a non-American view point as I've read many US war books.  So, in that sense, I feel like the author accomplished something. The writing is above average, it's just that the story seemed to lack substance.  (I know easy to say, I wasn't there getting shot at and freezing my a$$ off)<br />It's worth a read, but in all honestly &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is the way to go if you have to ration your reading time.  I don't mean to say that BHD is a better book (It is, in any case) but it is definitely a better story and more importantly the story is captured magnificently by the author.  It almost bothers me to have to recommend this book over Bravo Two Zero because for those who have not read BHD, you probably think it's some Hollywood flamed movie.  In all honesty, it is one of the best books I've ever read.  A second recommendation if you're looking for a &quot;Ranger-ish&quot; special forces type book, &quot;Ghost Soldiers&quot; is a must read.<br />To those who gave Bravo Two Zero 5 stars and raved about the action, I'm just curios to know what you would give BHD?  30 stars???????	2003-10-04

Once you get into Part II, it's hard to put the book down.  However, there is something funky about the writing that I can't put my finger on.  It's a bit wordy at times and the use of big words and multiple adverbs feels a little over kill at times.  I must question the editing of the book as well.  It seems like &quot;the story&quot; wasn't long enough for a full blown book, so elements were added afterward to help fill the pages.  The early chapters do not synch and all along you're waiting for them to tie in together or for characters introduced in the beginning to come back later in the book... but they never do.<br />Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this book, but I can't give it 5 stars based on some editing and writing issues.	2003-09-29

The book captures a southern mentality that refuses to die about &quot;The North vs. The South.&quot;  On many occasions I found myself thinking &quot;I can't believe there's people like this out there.&quot;<br />The strength of the book is with the random people he meets in coffee shops, museums, roadside attractions and his ability to get them to talk.  The few chapters on bigger issues (i.e. murder of the young man in the truck) were a little too macro for what I thought the book was about.  But that's just my personal taste.  I'd rather have read 100 stories of Joe Schmoe, than bigger political, economical, etc. type issues.  Nonetheless, the book is smooth reading and I do feel like I've learned something new.  I thought this type of mentality was in the backwoods of swamps, but apparently it's more prominent than most think.  More importantly, I now understand this event in history is a part of these people's lives (heritage) and we can't ask them to ignore it.<br />I wasn't too heavy into reading about the Civil War, but since reading this book, I will be revisiting the subject and read about some specific battles.<br />Excellent work.	2003-09-29

Disappointed on how the ending was handled.	I don't want to spoil it for people who may read, so I'll try to beat around the bush.<br />I would have liked a follow up chapter of \\"where are they now\\" and \\"what happened to the team\\".  If anybody knows, please email luigib@ragingbull.com.<br />McGinnis leaves the town with a sour taste in his mouth, nonetheless, it would have brought closure to find out what happened to these people.  Much like if you were ever dumped by someone, life goes on, but you do wonder \\"what ever happened to such and such\\"<br />Beside that, good reading, lots of great stories about Italian life, culture, geography, history.  Good book for soccer fans, great book for a study in small town life and big city problems.<br />I was disappointed in lack of pictures as well.  Not even a team shot.  I guess with the ending and the accusations, I understand why, but still disappointed.<br />The writer is very opinionated and inserts himself into the story more often than not.  This is not a fly on the wall recount.<br />Recommendation:  worth a read, but prepare yourself for some very slanted ideas and some self promotion.  It seems like there was even a better story out there, but it just wasn't captured all the way... maybe 80%	2003-09-05
US	32913141	R3LM8QDXJ7WTIZ	0871137380	189891237	Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Truth  always better than fiction	Wow!  Read this book in two sittings, flying to LAX and coming back home.  I just purchased a few other books that I want to read first, but you better believe BHD will be in the rotation again and again.<br />Surprisingly the movie captures a lot of the chaos and blunders, but still, as is usually the case, the book goes to the deepest corners.  An amazing read.  At first I was a little turned off by the &quot;term paper&quot; style writing.  I read Bowden's other book &quot;Killing Pablo&quot; before this (which is also a great read, btw, although not as good), so maybe reading them back to back was a little too much non fiction overload.  But by midway through, you feel like you're sitting in that Ops room watching the battle unfold yourself.  At times, I laughed out loud at some of the ironies.  Other times I wanted to cry.  Sometimes I just wanted to reach out and choke the burreaucracy.<br />You get the whole story here.  The ground level soldiers taking heavy fire, helicopter pilots trying to keep their orbit, families of the dead and wounded, the enemy's viewpoint, etc. etc.<br />Simply put, BUY IT.  It will get much use again and again.	2003-01-07
