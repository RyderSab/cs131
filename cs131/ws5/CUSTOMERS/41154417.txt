I've reviewed Lindsey Davis' FALCO mysteries before, and always rated them highly--something they deserved--for local color, human interest, scholarship, wit, and unusually good writing. <br /> <br />This one goes nowhere.  It's plodding, devoid of Falco's usual mental and physical exertions.  There's little if any character development except that Helena's brother Aelianus seems to be maturing and mellowing. Falco is acted upon, rather than being his usual competent and courageous self, someone who controls the denouement of the plot.  He makes an inordinate number of errors and bad judgments.  His actions turn to dust, and at the end nothing really has changed except that a sour widow has unnecessarily died. <br /> <br />The humor in all the others is missing here; instead there's a deep cynicism.  I'm sure Davis will hit her stride again, but this is the least important novel in the series.	2005-10-12

Clarke, especially THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS, but had found some of his ventures as a solo author, even the admirable \\"Manifold\\" novels, somewhat less inspiring.  EVOLUTION marks Baxter's emergence as a writer not only of scope, but of maturity and grace.  If his future writings bear out this promise, he will take his place on Charles Sheffield's vacant throne. <br /> <br />Perhaps it helped that the subject of evolution is one that has the profoundest religious significance to me.  Even as a child I couldn't understand how someone could be deeply religious and NOT believe in evolution, not love it! Evolution--cosmic, geological, biological, the time's arrow of entropy, all its manifestations--still seems to me, nearing age 70, the most liberating and beautiful method God (or whatever preceded the Big Bang) could have chosen for the universe.  My conviction of evolution's rightness is why, as an adult, I chose to follow Alfred North Whitehead's theology of evolution, which some call Process Philosophy and others Panentheism. This does not mean \\"intelligent design.\\"  To the contrary, evolution implies choice, error, contradiction, repeated failure and rare success (if any)--the scientific method writ large--but it may be the only process that can allow ample freedom of will for all beings to work out our various destinies within a largely deterministic universe of narrow physical parameters.  <br /> <br />Stephen Baxter shares the all-encompassing evolutionary vision, which makes his book worthy to be shelved alongside William Olaf Stapledon's essential (and profoundly theological) future histories, THE LAST AND FIRST MEN and THE STAR MAKER.  Baxter uses novelistic devices more than Stapledon did--in a recurring cliff-hanger story set in our near future, and in vignettes moving through time to describe critical world events defining the lives of our far-distant ancestors and far-future descendants.   <br /> <br />The ending is tragic, and to be true it has to be.  The earth is not eternal, nor is the universe itself, so how can we primates expect to go on forever?  Our primate brains are as capable of meanness and destruction as of altruism and beauty.  And in 2005, after the events of the past few years, it seems eminently possible for human greed and stupidity to bring an abrupt end to the great experiment called humanity.   <br /> <br />Knowing the final end, however, Baxter shows us that even the tiny-brained and weak can run a praiseworthy race under the most oppressive conditions, and that the struggle of life carries within it an intrinsic divinity called \\"evolution.\\"	2005-09-23

The title is appealing. I thought I was going to be reading a thoughtful analysis of terrorism. Instead, this is a work of overweening reductionist arrogance.    Here I am, a rationalist with undergraduate work in science and graduate degrees in philosophy and Medieval studies. My inclination is to be skeptical of all claims, religious or secular, beyond the observable and measurable. Blind faith seems unwise, and I'm just as skeptical of dogmatic atheism as of dogmatic religion. I'm also a political activist suspicious of fundamentalism and all other brands of dualist thinking. While I've read extensively in Eastern mysticism and years ago practiced Kundalini Yoga, I drifted away from it and prefer the Western Neoplatonist tradition, which to Americans is embodied in the poetry of Walt Whitman, and Process Philosophy. Now you know my biases.    The title of the book is highly misleading. Harris's reasoning does not follow the methodologies of Western logic from the time of Ockham to our day, but uses finger-pointing and character assassination, and sometimes verges on hysteria. Strangely, this muddy work has received plaudits from many that should know better, including the president of Union Theological Seminary. However, an enthusiastic review by Alan Dershowitz (who, like Harris, has condoned the use of torture) should be enough to put off genuinely skeptical readers.     Harris remains curiously blind to his own tautologies, and especially to his extreme dualism. He is a dualist agnostic or perhaps dualist atheist, seeing the world in the form of either-or choices. I have many friends who are agnostics and atheists, have belonged to various skeptical organizations, and didn't disagree with everything Harris wrote (I'm scared of G.W. Bush and his religious nut crowd, too), but Harris is like some other agnostic writers I've read who consider themselves to be rational. He uses an exceptionally narrow definition of \\"rationality.\\" Evidently he does not understand that we usually perceive reality as a COMBINATION of a priori \\"pure\\" reason, a posteriori experiment and observation (empiricism), and a dose of inspiration--which religious people call revelation.     I especially objected to his sneering. He enjoys putting down great figures of the past, who could hardly be expected to agree with everything that a 21st century grad student believes. Few would claim that pacifism is the ideal solution to all oppression, and I seriously doubt that Gandhi would have achieved anything in Hitler's Germany but his own martyrdom, but when Harris tosses nonviolence into the same \\"dogmatic\\" camp as terrorism, my reaction was to mutter \\"Ridiculous!\\"    Nor does he seem to understand that the subjective, fallible, highly imperfect, ill-informed and irrational human mind is a major cause of terrorism--that we are NOT rational animals, but rationalizing ones. This is where I part company with many agnostics who still consider humans perfectible. Unfortunately, most can and will perform the grossest of evils as long as an excuse for it can be provided. A \\"holy\\" excuse isn't required, just any kind of rationalization--plus ignorance. Recall those experiments in social psychology in which subjects kept on \\"torturing\\" others (whom they believed to be fellow-subjects) with electric shocks because Science in the person of a senior experimental scientist legitimized the experiment?    Finally--the author is not well informed about genuine liberal religion. Although he continually sneers at it he does not discuss it except in superficial generalizations. He excludes liberal religion as hopelessly benighted, in part because it is \\"irrational.\\" He claims it relies on blind faith--not HIS brand of blind faith, of course! The index--and so far as I could see the entire book, although I must confess that after a while I began skimming it--contains not one reference to Unitarianiam, Universalism, Process Philosophy, or any of theleading figures of liberal religions that make every possible effort to avoid both blind faith and dogmatic reductionism. Not that \\"faith\\" is to be despised as Harris does. I am not a follower of Francis of Assisi, yet I admire him and his life and example have had, over the centuries, positive effects on ethics. Harris's snide dismissal of him was crude and insulting--as if Francis could have prevented certain unsavory activities of his order after his death! He entirely overlooks their positive achievements, like their egalitarian preaching that helped to inspire social rebellions all over Europe--like the 1381 Peasants' Revolt in England that tripled the net earning power of the lower classes from the end of the 14th century through most of the 15th.     As for mysticism, I'll stick with the pragmatic, humane, Western Neoplatonist tradtion. The mysticism of the East, while providing insights, relies too much on the concept of maya and on pantheist and panpsychist concepts of deity, which erode ethics and make practical changes in society, including relief of suffering, seem futile. No thanks. Give me my Medieval friend Juliane of Norwich, with her sense of humor, loving tolerance, and disbelief in hell.    This book can be summed up in one word: \\"crank.\\" I'll file this one in my library with Velikovsky, the BOOKS OF CHARLES FORT and Ignatius Donnelly's ATLANTIS.    It's not worth your time. Instead, read or reread the old classic, Eric Hoffer's THE TRUE BELIEVER, and a fine recent book that--refraining from insults and hysteria--better understands the terrorist connection to religion (and fanaticism), Charles Kimball's WHEN RELIGION BECOMES EVIL.	2005-07-11

Jim Swope, the firefighter hero, will become a vegetable unless he discovers an antidote for an unknown poison that he and several others handled during a highway fire, and that quest gives this novel the flavor of a near-future sci-fi medical thriller. <br /> <br />I love Emerson's chapter titles in his Mac Fontana and stand-alone firefighting novels, which often make references to sci-fi books or movies (like \\"Stephanie Gets Into Donovan's Brain\\" in this book), so I figure it was only a matter of time before my favorite fireman would cross the line and slip a sci-fi element into his plot!

In the meanwhile I've completed graduate work in Medieval studies, specialized (somewhat) in Medieval Celtic culture, and read THE MABINOGION more than once.  It seems a shame that L'Engle did not do even a minimum amount of homework for this novel.  The story was not bad, less snobbish than many of hers, but fatally flawed by errors.  I feel that the scholarship behind writing for young adults needs to be especially cautious and error-free. <br /> <br />First, when L'Engle wrote this book did she know anything about Mendelian genetics?  Blue eyes in an overwhelmingly dark-brown eyed population would have disappeared very rapidly, certainly by the third generation--unless (horrors) they practiced incest. <br /> <br />Next, some comments on the Welsh background. Owain Gwynedd was a real king of North Wales, a very important king who lived in the 12th century.  He was NOT a pagan but a Christian., yet L'Engle made his son Madoc or Madog non-Christian in belief.  Certainly there were many pre-Christian elements in 12th century Welsh society--but Madoc would never have kept referring to \\"the gods\\" and would have prayed to Christ and the saints. <br /> <br />The Madoc-Indian story is an old one, perfectly acceptable in a fantasy, but L'Engle ruins the Branwen story!  The Branwen tale in THE MABINOGION is not the sweet rather sad story told by Beezie's (Irish!) Grandma.  It describes a truly sadistic, vengeful, gory, \\"ethnic cleansing\\" war between North Wales and Ireland in which everyone in Ireland is killed except five (pregnant) Irish women.  Such a tale would hardly be passed down in Ireland, not even in L'Engle's wildly cleaned-up version--and why would an Irish king flee from Ireland by ship anyway?  If the original story was supposed to have become garbled over the years, then L'Engle should have explained that. <br /> <br />Does L'Engle know how to pronounce Spanishand Welsh?  I doubt it.  As a result, the name \\"Branzillo\\" made little sense.  Granting that \\"Zilla\\" is supposed to be a (rather unlikely) Native American name, the /ll/ might have been pronounced \\"ull\\" as in English if the Llawcaes spoke English as their home tongue.  But if the Llawcaes spoke Welsh they would have heard and spelled the name not \\"Zilla\\" but \\"Sila.\\"  There is no /z/ in Welsh.  Even more important, the /l/ sound in Welsh, from Medieval times, has been /l/.  Welsh /ll/ is a very complex phoneme, a faint sibilant plus /th/ plus /f/ plus /l/.  In Welsh, \\"Zilla\\" would be pronounced something like \\"Sithfla.\\"  The Spanish /ll/ is just as troublesome.  In Spain and Venezuela it is \\"lyuh\\", in the rest of Spanish America the pronunciation is \\"yuh.\\"  \\"Branzillo\\" would be pronounced in South American Spanish \\"Bronzeeyo.\\"  How can any of these names be connected \\"by ear\\"?  They can't. <br /> <br />Sorry, that's just too much carelessness.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-06

I love well-written science-fiction and appreciate good writing, so I bought this because of the reviews.  The problem was that this novel turned out to be a deadly boring \\"romance,\\" not even well-written, confirming a long-standing inclination to be cynical about professional book reviewing.  I didn't mind the explicit sex, though we could have had less of it, or occasional four letter words, or the punk tastes.  The first hundred pages are gripping, but then the characterization disintegrates and the situations began repeating.  As for the writing style: ultimately I became annoyed with the author's incessant use of the present tense, which is just too, too avant-garde and in a long novel SO irritating.  By page 200 my attention was dragging and I started noticing that my capacity to care for the characters was running out of steam.  I gave up at about page 300 and speed-read the rest of it. 531 pages of artsy, psuedo-intense romantical writing were just too much, plus those unnecessary High School English questions at the end.<br /><br />I confess that romance novels give me a pain, anyway, and the pantingly hot ones are the most boring (those my mother used to call the \\"plunging neckline school of writing\\" and a college friend once termed \\"make-out novels for those who don't\\"). The plots are unreal, especially the sex, and this one was sillier than usual.  Henry's ridiculously exaggerated sexual prowess made me wonder about Niffenger's fantasies. Because the author placed soap opera in the forefront, science-fictionally the plot fell apart.  I spent my early childhood in Chicago, and it's COOOOLD in winter, so the primary puzzle for me was why Henry never froze to death somewhere along the way.  (Maybe everyone should have moved to the Equator.) The characterization was uneven and the main characters became less interesting as the story went on, until they irritated me.  Clare wasn't strong, as some reviewers claim.  She was obsessive, but that's a weakness, not a strength.  I found her wimpy, not terribly bright, and far too willing to be used.<br /><br />As for Henry, I could NEVER visualize him working as a librarian!  For one thing, how did he keep from popping out of sight in front of library visitors?  How could he work at any steady daily job?  It seemed that with his developed lock-picking and wallet-stealing \\"talents,\\" not to mention his tastes and minimalist conscience, he would more naturally have drifted into a life of crime.  In lacking a conscience he seemed like a psychopath, more of a Ted Bundy than Mr. Hero, and that brings me to point three.<br /><br />Soap operas all have one thing in common:  they actually PRAISE obsessive and possessive behavior, as if it were a good trait rather than a chilling evil.  This novel makes all those mistakes in portraying Henry. Clare, too.  To love \\"forever\\" implies possession.  No matter how often the characters in this novel mull over free will and predestination, it's obvious that the author prefers predestination, since it excuses her characters' blind possessiveness. I might have enjoyed the novel despite its obvious flaws -- or at least not disliked it -- had the author limited her fantasies to 150 pages, no more than 200.  Too bad writers are paid by the word.  If you really must read a science-fiction love story and want one that's well-written and makes some sense, read the novelette, \\"At the Eschaton\\" by Charles Sheffield. It's in Gregory Benford's 1995 story collection FAR FUTURES. Sheffield, who may be sci-fi's all-time most sensitive writer, understands the obsessiveness of his male character, whose wife, being in cold sleep for eons, isn't bothered by it.  He packs this story into about 150 pages, and for goodness sake don't bother with the expanded novel, TOMORROW AND TOMORROW, which is as padded and boring as the Niffenger book.  But \\"At the Eschaton,\\" in the form of a tightly-written novelette, is a touching love story without theusual soap opera baggage which THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE has in sickening abundance.thout the usual soap opera baggage which THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE has in sickening abundance.	2004-08-10

Recently I reread it and remain greatly impressed by Loewen's argument for relevant problem-oriented history teaching -- and suggest that it be applied not only American history but to world history, too. I never cared for schoolbook history, despite a thrilling family diary written in the 1870s by my great-grandfather (1828-1911), whose pioneer family's activities in the Underground Railroad are not only in the diary but mentioned in history books, family tales of relatives who fought for the Union in the Civil War, and an aunt who in 1911 chained herself to the high school gate until they let her take wood shop. I had to develop a taste for U.S. history as an adult, through reading historical, political and sociological books and subscribing to several current events magazines. <br />  <br /> After resigning from the Navy I chose graduate work in Medieval studies, specifically Medieval social, religious, economic and political dissenting movements, because that's where Western political democracy and social equity begin, and the era teaches us why separation of church and state is so vital. I often tell friends that history is vastly more entertaining than any soap opera! You'd never know it from the textbooks. <br />  <br /> I'm one-sixteenth Shawnee, and my mother had to teach me about our Native American heritage and embody me with a lifelong passion for the Shawnee struggle against white domination. The rest of me is Euro-American and female. I love the Dead White Men and many of the ideas they contributed, but recognize their faults and being left out of schoolbooks except as a nonentity or a savage still rankles. When I was 13 a movie filmed in Africa, KING SOLOMON'S MINES, made me resent my schoolbooks' total lack of interest in African and African-American histories and cultures. I began to pursue African studies through libraries and have never ceased, even learning a Bantu language, Sesotho.<br />  <br /> I'm very grateful to Loewen for his passionate defense of a better balance in school textbooks. I'd include world history education as well as American within the subjects that need to be made more inclusive. Right now I'm studying Korean Medieval history, and am finding these stories and personalities as thrilling as the more familiar ones from Europe. But why (as usual) did I need to discover this through the back door, a Korean-made historical series shown on a local public TV channel? <br />  <br /> Worst of all, as Loewen points out, school textbooks are packed with pseudo-patriotic lies. While serving as a Naval officer I befriended a Royal Canadian Navy officer who lent me one of his Canadian high school history textbooks. Reading it, I learned the truth about the War of 1812 for the first time. The U.S. lost that war, since our primary purpose was to annex Canada. Obviously the Canadians won, since they remain an independent nation. Another lie was the implication of CDR Lawrence's famous dying words, &quot;Don't give up the ship,&quot; since they did. <br />  <br /> Loewen tells me why I disliked school history. I was bored, and perhaps suspected the lack of truth. Though I earned A's, I wouldn't be able to parrot back any in-depth information on the Smoot-Hawley Act -- nor, until grad school, on the Hundred Years' War. The situation is now worse than in my day, since useless testing, not instilling a genuine love of learning, controls national education policy. When you combine that with right-wing biased TV news, current policy guarantees an ignorant, reckless electorate. It's curious that you list detractors' reviews ahead of reviewers who admired this book. It would be better to put the most recent ones first, as you do with other book reviews. <br />	2004-07-28

I still consider myself fiscally cautious, a conservationist, and a champion of the Constitution -- all attributes that once defined Conservatives, who nowadays have degenerated into neo-Confederate, propaganda-manipulating, bomb-happy, off-the-wall anarchists, obsessed with welfare for the super-rich AT ANY PRICE.  Even toying with the loss of American prosperity and freedom. <br /> <br />When the Dixiecrats became Republicans I departed, and am now active in the peace movement, a Democrat, and an energetic Left-Liberal (AND PROUD OF IT!), but until the past 4 years I always made a point of subscribing to a few conservative journals and reading at least four or five books by thoughtful conservatives every year.  In retirement I can't afford the magazines, but have never missed a book by Kevin Phillips.  Even when I've disagreed, his arguments made me think, and I frequently found myself agreeing with him.   <br /> <br />Now -- much to my delight -- Mr. Phillips has joined the growing exodus of intelligent Americans out of the Republican Party. His latest book throws down the gauntlet to the large extended family surnamed Bush, Walker, et al.  It exposes the old school tie cronyism which has become a phony good old boy network, a collection of diehards who detest women, court-house bubbas who once opposed integration, and would-be ayatollahs and theocrats who would force their personal brand of religion on the rest of us.  It is also another revelation, among many recent ones, of the Bush family's close ties to foreign dictatorships from Nazi Germany to Saudi Arabia. <br /> <br />My only criticism is that the information is loaded on so thickly it sometimes becomes overkill.  But better overkill than the notorious journalistic boot-licking that has kept the public in ignorance and brought America down so dangerous a path.  Highly recommended.	2004-07-26

With the exception of portraying the human tendency to &quot;believe rather than understand,&quot; the Ku Klux Klan demagogue leaders, and General Humphreys (whose behavior indicates mental illness) there are few villains in this book except the weather and the inexorable Mississippi River. <br />I found Barry's portrayals of Eads, the Percys, Kemper, the hard-working African-Americans, even the dangerously erratic Humphreys fascinating. Isaac Cline (leading character of another well-written study of a major weather disaster, Larson's ISAAC'S STORM) reappears in this book to the reader's advantage.  The author knows how politics works.  Without expressing sympathy or holier-than-thou condemnation, he understands the often pathetic motivations of the 1920s Ku Kluxers -- highly relevant to today's anti-intellectual fundamentalist extremism -- and his review of the political repression under Wilson makes me thank God that things haven't yet gone quite that far under our present-day, similarly dimwitted, administration.<br />The author's conclusion, that a single preventable flood radically changed political history, was presented cogently and convincingly.  Altogether this is a work of rare excitement and scholarship.  Highly recommended.	2004-07-09

Where I possess some expertise I caught numerous errors, and therefore don't trust any of the information in this book, although I found the subject interesting and worthy of a good popular treatment.<br />The author treated the Medieval era sloppily.  Druids did not &quot;compete&quot; with Christianity through the 5th century AD.  Most of them were murdered by the Romans, the survivors losing influence.  The Celts (their elite, the only ones who counted) had adopted Christianity by the 3rd century, and spread out all over Europe, even to Italy, as missionaries and teachers.  Perhaps Fagan is confusing Druidism, a pagan religion, with the brilliant and tolerant Pelagian &quot;Celtic&quot; Christianity that flourished from about the 3rd to the 8th centuries, survived in enclaves -- possibly, as some claim, influencing dissenting Protestantism many centuries later.  There were plenty of European pagans in the 5th century, but they resided in the Germanic, Baltic and Slavic lands, which weren't converted till later.<br />Where does he get the idea that Gothic architecture began as early as the 10th century, which was the heyday of the Romanesque style?  Gothic architecture appeared tentatively in the mid-12th century, but the Gothic era spanned the late 12th century through the 15th, with the 13th century as its most creative period.<br />Even more worrisome than the careless Medieval research are Fagan's maps and illustrations.  First of all, I recognized some maps and drawings from other books but can't find them cited in the credits. Perhaps because several were taken from other sources, there's a frequent lack of correspondence between text and picture, or simply an incomplete drawing.  Examples:  On p. 16 Western Spain is covered in dark gray, but there's no legend for dark gray.  On p. 81, in a section on the Kebarans, I looked in vain to find the name &quot;Kebara&quot; on the map.  Worst of all, on p. 163 the illustration shows the phallic Egyptian god &quot;Mut.&quot;  The text names this god as &quot;Min.&quot;  There are many other graphics with similarly irksome problems.<br />I remember the first edition of MacNeil's ENGLISH LANGUAGE having similar problems with poorly proofed maps and illustrations, and a corrected edition being hastily published.

Nearly all are witty, wise and well-written, satisfying all three of the \\"Important W's\\" of popular fiction.  In all the other Jenny Cain novels, even BUM STEER, the plotting is tight, the characters plausible, and although clues are dropped along the way, the conclusions aren't easy for a reader to figure out.  <br />TWILIGHT's chief problem is that it's a clumsy mystery.

Even distracted by the Autumn Festival, how could she have misinterpreted Bill's odd behavior and remarks as \\"funny\\" when readers immediately know that something is wrong with his perception of reality?<BR> <BR>And the main plot -- the hazards of an urban hiking trial crossing a road for vehicles -- makes a mountain out of a molehill.  It's unworthy of Ms. Pickard's doubtless gifts as a writer, since the persons who should have been consulted on the issue of road safety apparently never were when the trail was created -- namely, state, county, and insurance safety engineers.  My father was a safety engineer, who would have taken about one afternoon to recommend answers to the hazards of that fatal road crossing.  There must be quite a few safety specialists in Massachusetts since, when I lived in New England back in the 60s, there were plenty of road signs.<br />There were also hiking trails, many of which crossed paved roads.  Didn't Nancy Pickard ever hear of multiple signs warning of pedestrian crossings?  Of blinking red lights?  Ordinary stop signs at the bottom of the grade, on both sides of the trail, would have prevented every one of the fatalities caused by the carelessness of a person who seemed not to wander from his own yard and driveway.  <br />Look, I live in Philadelphia.  We have a long woodsyhiking trail winding along a scenic creek with urban neighborhoods on either side. Going from the Chestnut Hill neighbohood to the Andorra neighborhood, a heavily trafficked road crosses this trail -- and vice-versa.  This crossing is protected by stop signs, and elswehere by traffic overpasses.  Urban trails are, of course, inherently somewhat unsafe.  The trails in Philly are sometimes stalked by muggers and rapists, but if any hiker has been killed by a vehicle in the seven years I've lived in Philly I've never heard of it.<br />I'm sorry that the Jenny Cain series is at an end, but perhaps Ms. Pickard realized that something went wrong with this book.  I just wish Jenny had gone out like a lioness.	2004-03-23

Dr Van Sertima's assertions of Egyptian influence in America surprised me.  Because of the time disparity between, for example, Egyptian Old Kingdom pyramids of the 3rd millennium BC and Mexican pyramids of the 1st and 2nd millennium AD, and their entirely different uses, these claims are entirely unconvincing.<br />However, take away the romantic exaggerations and I believe that some of Dr. Van Sertima's assertions of a pre-Columbian African presence in America have a good probability of being true. It seems plausible that traders and marooned sailors from African seagoing vessels, both accidentally and deliberately came to American waters now and then, along with rare landfalls of European, Asian and Oceanian boats and ships.  Only the Oceanian Polynesians are known beyond doubt to have set up a permanent colony in America, on Easter Island off the coast of Chile.  Easter Islanders may have had brief contacts with the mainland before they ruined their forests and their seagoing capabilities, but despite Thor Heyerdahl, anything beyond minor influence is still unproven.<br />The vital question is: did the African visitors make important changes to vital aspects of Native American society such as religion or architecture - changes far greater than the minuscule influences of occasional visitors to America from, say, China or Greenland?  Although I'm partly Native American I hope there's a grain of truth in the idea that some Africans came to America, influenced culture, and became \\"gods.\\"  It's a promising thesis and I'd jump for joy if it could be proven.  Unfortunately, after adding up all of Dr. Van Sertima's arguments, even the linguistic ones and especially those citing art, his conclusions remain unproven. The least convincing arguments are the photographs and chapters on art.  Years ago I noted physical resemblances to Africans (and to Europeans and Asians) in Latin American portrait head sculpture and ceramics, but were these heads meant as faithful copies of facial features or as stylized icons?  More troubling to me is the fact that certain sculptures are demonic -- unflattering caricatures of presumably African facial features, as stereotyped as the \\"Der Sturmer\\" cartoons of Jews.  Right now my money is on iconography.<br />The thesis of a ruling class of Africans in America, although unproven, isn't necessarily unprovable.  DNA testing of Native American populations the author believes to be partially descended from Africans would disclose the closeness (or not) of the relationship. If the people aren't willing to be tested, then the DNA of the domestic plants Van Sertima says were imported from Africa should be compared to that of African vegetation.  DNA doesn't lie and it passes down through the mitochondria and certain other cell components for a vast number of generations.  Once the tests are completed, this book, which has been in print a long time, will either stand as a champion of far-seeing science, like Wegener's early continental drift hypothesis (given that in both of them certain ideas were exaggerated or overlooked) or it will slip into the limbo of most other diffusionist ethnology.<br />If someone has already published these DNA test results, I'd like to know how to find them.  In the meanwhile, at least temporarily, I'll shelve this book with Donnelly's ATLANTIS, Churchward's MU, Velikovsky's WORLDS IN COLLISION, Fort's LO! and my other collected works of entertaining pseudoscience.he linguistic ones and especially those citing art, his conclusions remain unproven.

US	41154417	R2CJQ5XK6YA5YX	1840222107	456842329	The Crecy War: A Military History of the Hundred Years War from 1337 to the Peace of Bretigny, 1360 (Wordsworth Military Library)	Books	5	15	20	N	Y	A superb story of the personalities, strategies & tactics	The Fourteenth Century is \\"my\\" century, and in my career I've been a professional military officer, Medieval historian and author.  Perhaps that's why I admire Lt-Col Alfred H. Burne, D.S.O. and Fellow, Royal Historical Society, who wrote this valuable history book back in the 1950s using his own combination of skills as historian, professional military tactician in the British Army, and story-teller. After nearly 50 years THE CRECY WAR remains the best retelling I've read of the English military campaigns in France during the first half of the Fourteenth Century.  No other book written in English approaches it for insight as well as information.<br />Like certain other Medievalists who served in World War II, Burne was assigned to the Allied staff developing the strategy of \\"Operation Overlord\\" -- the Normandy Invasion -- since the landings were planned for the La Manche coast near Cotentin, a few miles from the 1346 landfall of the English army.  The entire 1944 buildup to D-Day, not only the landing site but the earlier diversions, intelligence gathering and disinformation campaign, were deliberately patterned after Edward III's successful Normandy invasion of 1346. Unfortunately the WWII forward thrust through France was a great deal more difficult and costly than the 1346 chevauchee that led to England's overwhelming victory at Crecy, then to the capture of Calais in 1347.<br />I share Burne's dubious, occasionally hostile, opinion of King Edward III of England. Edward's obsession with the throne of France caused social, economic and political upheavals throughout Europe and the unnecessary loss of tens of thousands of lives, with the suffering falling most heavily upon the poor of France. Burne even compares the English king to Hitler.  Edward's motives were primarily those of self-aggrandizement, and he was not a particularly talented battle leader, commanding the Reserve division at Crecy, which meant that he stayed out of the fight and watched it from a tall windmill (rebuilt in our time as an observation tower for tourists).  The king had the good luck to possess brilliant and loyal kinsmen and noblemen, and from them he chose as his field commanders some of the finest Britain has ever known.<br />One of Edward's leading generals was his first cousin, William Bohun, Earl of Northampton (1312?-1360), 29 or 30 years old when he led the English to a stunning victory at Morlaix in Brittany in 1342.  Morlaix was the first English victory in France, other than in English-held Gascony, since Richard the Lion-Heart's campaigns.  At Crecy, William Bohun was still only 34 years old when Edward chose him as co-commander of the Second \\"Battle\\" (or division) during the battle.  He was in fact the lead commander of the Second, since his colleague was the Earl of Arundel, a mediocre soldier whose personal scandals had made him unpopular with other magnates, but who had to be placated since his vast wealth helped to finance the invasion and the king was deeply indebted to him.  (Northampton also owed Arundel.  Primary sources indicate that he was almost always heavily in debt.)<br />A few historians like T.F. Tout have recognized Northampton's prowess as both strategist and leader of troops.  He never lost a battle.  Oddly, he was the quiet one of a pair of twins -- the other died very young in the wars in Scotland -- who might never have been noticed for command if his affable twin had lived. Burne's contribution is to give us valuable glimpses into the warrior career of this unobtrusive \\"unknown soldier.\\" These include crossing a broken bridge over the Seine on a 1-foot-wide plank, taking the French by surprise and assuring the English command of the right bank.  Northampton's genius lay not in swashbuckling, however, but in strategic planning.  Early on he recognized the excellence of his grandfather Edward I's tactic of massed Welsh and English archers, unused between Edward I's death in 1307 and the early 1330s, during the border wars with Scotland. During these campaigns, while still only a youthful knight in his early 20s, Tout believed that William Bohun began drilling his men in combined formations: massed archers working alongside unmounted knights whose swords protected the archers and \\"hedges\\" of pikemen similar to the schiltrons of Robert Bruce.  His armies became expert at planting hidden \\"booby-traps.\\" These combinations proved formidable against armored cavalry and resulted in English victories not only at Crecy but earlier at Halidon and Morlaix, and (resuscitated by Northampton's great-grandson Henry V) at Agincourt.  Of the major English land victories in this period, only the Black Prince's generalship at Poitiers and Najera made use of old-fashioned cavalry, and Poitiers was won more by luck than skill. <br />Burne was the first to give us details of Northampton's swift march over the mountains of Brittany to catch the French by surprise, the archery-dominated battle of Morlaix, the battle and aftermath of Crecy, his leadership during the siege of Calais, and his service as a diplomat, up to the invasion of France in 1359-60 when he suddenly drops out of history, either ill or wounded.  Perhaps because he died so young, under the age of 50, Northampton is forgotten.  Even in his own day he was so retiring that he was passed over as one of the Founder knights of the Order of the Garter (ca. 1348), and had to wait in line for his nomination despite overwhelming qualifications.  One historian (not Burne) has speculated that King Edward preferred amusing courtiers and that William Bohun may have inherited his father's melancholy personality.  Even so, this Fourteenth Century Earl of Northampton might be ranked the greatest general, next to Wellington, that England has ever produced.<br />I've owned a hardback copy of THE CRECY WAR for years and am delighted that this fine book has been reprinted.  My old copy is dogeared, yellowed, underlined to death, and otherwise difficultto read straight through -- so here's our chance to buy an inexpensive paperback of a valuable resource.  Anyone with the slightest interest in Medieval warfare should do the same.	2004-02-09
US	41154417	RBWJSS62QLIAD	0156003627	298384228	A History Maker	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Indescribable -- and wonderful!	How can I review a book that's essentially indescribable?  For one thing, A HISTORY MAKER isn't really a novel but a Stapledonian future-history in miniature, although it's too short and succinct to fit comfortably into that rambling genre.  Perhaps the closest to Gray in style, wit, and profoundly enraged (civilized) humanism is my favorite Italian, Umberto Eco -- but A HISTORY MAKER remains apart from BAUDOLINO or any other surreal, fantasy or science fiction novel I've ever read.  I've devoured about 3 or 4 such books each week for the past fifty-five years, so I'm a fair judge.<br />If A HISTORY MAKER isn't a novel, nor a full-blown future history, what is it?  It certainly is not, as the London DAILY TELEGRAPH blurb has it, \\"Sir Walter Scott meets Rollerball.\\"  I bought the book a few years ago because a friend recommended it, but when I got it home I did a double-take at that awful blurb, which I dare say was meant as a come-on.  It turned me off so I put A HISTORY MAKER up on a high shelf till this week.  I'll grant the strong possibility of Borderer Walter Scott's influence, but comparing this book to \\"Rollerball\\" is hyter-styte, as Wat Dryhope might say.  So's the literary review labeling the language in this book \\"futuristic,\\" when it's nocht but auld lang syne Scots Lowland tongue.<br />\\"Rollerball\\" as I recall pandered to the superficially grown-up but socially preadolescent male who can't deal with his own testosterone but lacks the vigor to bash everything in sight -- and therefore does so vicariously.  A HISTORY MAKER starts out misleading the reader into thinking that it might just be another one of those silly \\"heroic\\" war stories.  But strobblin' Wat makes an unusual and highly imperfect hero -- confused, dour, educated, ambivalent, attractive to women, hating bloodshed but a braw warrior, a natural leader.  I see him as Gray's future incarnation of Robert Bruce, who was no pulp fiction cowboy hero, but one of history's genuinely great men.  Bruce,too, embodied the same characteristics; they even share a preference for ponies instead of gigantic warhorses.<br />Once we realize that Wat lives, as Walt Whitman wrote, \\"in and out of the game, watching and wondering at it,\\" Gray has begun the process of standing the whole genre of male violence and hero worship on its doitered heid, and he keeps on till any sane person would be embarrassed ever again to take The Alamo, The Somme, Rambo or Iraq seriously.  At the same time the author understands that male boredom and feelings of inadequacy are at the root of it all, and he sympathizes, as should we all.  None the less, the older women, not the men, are the saviors of civilization in this book.<br />I can't really describe A HISTORY MAKER. I can only revel in Gray's use of language, the punning names, the snatches of folklore and off-color doggerel, the tweaking of asinine Thatcherism/Toryism and love of liberty, and -- in the finest sci-fi tradition -- the casual way in which his Scotland of the 23rd Century is introduced to us. The story ends like a Mozart symphony, exactly when it should.  As would occur in a genuine historical document, background, a glossary of Scots words, and what-happened-next get explained in five \\"historical\\" chapters after the story's end, plus a postscript.  We could compare these post-chapters to Tolkein's in THE RETURN OF THE KING, but Gray's are as hysterical as they are historical -- parodies.  After such a wrap-up there can be no sequel, so enjoy A HISTORY MAKER while it lasts.  It's a brief book but nigh-hand perfect.	2004-01-30

THE OCTOBER HORSE is definitely not up to the standard of the enjoyable earlier books in McCullough's Roman series. In all her Roman novels McCullough has had a crush on Caesar.  I can understand that.  Students of history do fall in love with people who've been dead for hundreds of years.  I've heard that even biographers of Hitler feel some empathy.  Surely Caesar was a Hitler prototype if ever there was, but McCullough can find no fault with him. He is a far-seeing \\"god,\\" his edicts entirely benign. (Oh sure!  Just like Mao Tse-Tung's.) Even in the novel, we can smell \\"tyrant\\" between the lines in nearly every public act of Caesar's after he became Dictator for Life, and certain of the Liberators must have had genuine patriotic grievances beyond petty jealousy.<br />Her portrayals of Sulla, Crassus and Pompey in the earlier novels contained some wit, irony and sympathy, and I felt sad when Pompey was murdered.  Not here.  When the conspirators finally got Caesar three-fifths of the way through it lacked all emotional impact, since in the early pages he had seemed no more alive than a noble statue.  Octavian then carries on humorlessly as yet another \\"noble\\" tyrant.  Much more believable and ironic is Robert Graves' portrayal of Octavian as old emperor Augustus who nostalgically recalls the long-gone Republic.<br />THE OCTOBER HORSE should be roundly criticized by classical scholars, if any bother to read it. McCullough has done much reading on the Late Republic, but she is prone to spin myths out of imagination.  Despite the number of documents from the period, several plot elements rely on guesswork.  I know she's a physician, but what made her decide that Octavian suffered from asthma while Cicero, who as a youth also avoided battle, was a coward?  McCullough makes Cicero into the eternal nerd.  (Maybe, like me, she came to loathe him after wallowing through DE SENECTUTE -- \\"CONCERNING OLD AGE\\" -- at the age of 18.)<br />McCullough may not be too far off the mark with Cleopatra, and her Porcia, Cato's crazy daughter, was actually more interesting than Shakespeare's sweet, wifely Portia. Unfortunately her other portrayals, of Antony, Servilia, and several well-known historical situations, lack dimension and plausibility.  Her Antony is a thick-headed brute without any political skills except, she admits, oratory.  When she tries to rehabilitate him at the end it doesn't work.  She makes some attempt to humanize Brutus, Porcia, Cleopatra and Cato, exploring Cato's repellant character and Brutus's melancholy with dispassionate criticism and a touch of sympathy, although we come away with no real understanding of Brutus or his motivations beyond his fanatic wife's influence on his actions.<BR>  <BR>McCullough shows an understanding of warfare, politics and mob manipulation, but the novel needs to be more.  Because of her uncritical adulation for Caesar, her style, especially in this book, is uneven and awkward.  Quite inexcusable is her failure to warn us of the similarities between Rome and our own government's imperialist policies.  The best she does is having Octavian inform us that \\"a world empire...means a new form of government... Caesar saw what had to be done.\\" (Page 853) How nauseating!  Where's the irony here, so badly needed?  It's time to end this tired series before it goes on to celebrate the violent, debased and corrupt Roman Empire.  Read Robert Graves and Lindsey Davis instead.  You'll get the picture.	2004-01-05

He loves all three of these faiths with a deep-rooted passion and is also an admirer of Buddhism and of Gandhi.  For years he has served the cause of cross-cultural understanding and human rights as speaker, writer and National Council of Churches diplomat.  Dr. Kimball was ideally situated to write a book clarifying the troubling issues raised by 9/11 and other recent events worldwide.<br />The book's primary theme is to find out why certain followers of religion enslave themselves to doctrine, and why they dehumanize, even demonize, those who follow other paths.  It begins with a head-on discussion of whether religion itself is the problem, concluding, as most of us would, that genuinely transcendent religious faith -- like Martin Luther King's and Gandhi's -- provides history's cutting edge for good, but that coerced religious practice is intrinsically evil.  More than once he writes that \\"freedom from religion is a corollary to freedom of religion.\\"  The chapters are broken into his choice of the five most dangerous tendencies of religious belief, which are listed below along with a few of the subtopics.  In some ways this is a weak structure, since many of the topics and subtopics overlap, but sorting them into five broad areas aids the reader in focusing on important issues:<br />Absolute truth claims -- misunderstanding and denigration of other faiths, idolatry of sacred texts and/or hierarchies, the difficulty of defining deep religious concepts in words<br />Blind obedience -- requiring adherents to \\"disconnect their brain\\" (Kimball's phrase),not only within cults like Jonestown and Aum Shinrikyo, but also troubling manifestations within all the major world faiths<br />Establishing the \\"ideal\\" time -- Millennialism, Israel-Palestine, televangelism, the Taliban<br />The end justifies any means -- Hindu-Muslim conflicts, Bosnia, murder of abortionists, cover-ups of child-molesting priests<br />Declaring holy war -- Christian crusades and inquisitions, Islamic and Jewish fanaticism, cynical use of religion for political ends, the real meaning of &quot;jihad.&quot;<br />Although I've read the Qu'ran a couple of times, that was some years ago and I learned so much about the nobler aspects of Islam from Kimball's book that I intend to reread that faith's sacred text.  Kimball's final chapter, on inclusive belief, is cautiously hopeful, and ends in a quote from the Qu'ran, Surah 5:48, which is more latitudinarian than anything I recall from either the Judaic or Christian scriptures: \\"If God had so willed He would have created you one community, but [instead] . . . compete with one another in good works.\\"  As Kimball sees it, the sublimest aspect of religion is its vast and infinite diversity, providing all varieties of competition for good, which in time may overwhelm the evil tendencies of religious narrowness.<br />Keep this impressive book on your shelf next to Eric Hoffer's classic on political fanaticism, The True Believer.	2003-12-23

However, Kinsey has regained her brains, and the novel gives us several welcome new departures, including a change of venue and deepening friendships with a couple of old, sickly cops whose odd-couple relationship is well characterized.  We also learn more about Kinsey's background and family, and Aunt &quot;Gin&quot; is getting to be less likeable with each revelation.<br />Kinsey's still too much &quot;lawn-order&quot; for my sensibilities, but I suppose that's consistent with what she does for a living.  At least she acts intelligently in this book, not with the abysmal stupidity of P IS FOR PERIL, and it's a good read, with a plot based loosely on an unsolved case of the 1960s.  I'm sure I wasn't the only reader who felt compassion for the unknown real-life Jane Doe, murdered so many years ago, and the family from whom she permanently disappeared.	2003-12-23

But he wouldn't stack up against sci-fi genius Charles Sheffield and certainly not against Ursula le Guin, and that's because he's invariably lousy at characterization, almost as if he's lived a too-sheltered or too-solitary life.  Other reviewers have complained of the lack of emotional &quot;affect&quot; in the marital relationship between Jack and Julia, so I won't, but it comes across as a really awful marriage -- which I doubt Crichton intended.<br />In many aspects, including the desert lab and the thoughtless military-oriented technology, the book seemed like an update of THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN.  Because of that, there are some genuinely positive values here.  It's always good to be reminded of the essential brutality of the military-industrial complex and rampant capitalism.  And a nanotechnology plague seems scarier than anything Crichton's done to date -- more likely to happen in the near future.<br />The best part of the tale, which seemed deliberate on Crichton's part, was how the author stood ANDROMEDA STRAIN on its head!  In the older novel, written in far better times than these, the government supplied its citizens with the most up-to-date protection possible against technological terror, and the scientists (though cardboard characters) were said to be the best in their fields.<br />In PREY, private industry, serving DOD, works out of a sordid and botchy lab in a low-bid competitive race, the ultimate guarantee of trashy and dangerous results.  In case the failures of the space shuttles haven't been enough, this is a good lesson for us all.	2003-12-23

Unlike the Watch and Death novels, even some others in the Witch subseries, this book makes little pretense to deliver Pratchett's 3-P's--profundities, politics and philosophy--although we do get something of a political lesson on the perils of utopianism.  It's the funniest of all the Discworld stories. Even rereading it, I find myself laughing until I get tears in my ears.<br />WITCHES ABROAD lampoons just about every tourism cliche, and I suppose I got the biggest laughs from the parodies of riverboat gamblers on the Vieux (Ol' Man) River and Mardi Gras (\\"Fat Lunchtime\\" according to Nanny), plus a voodoo witch with a Russian name and a baba yaga house, which made her even funnier.  Every fairy tale you can imagine is parodied and twisted around, even modern ones like THE WIZARD OF OZ.  But the best lampoon is the hysterical two page Hemingway send-up in the bull chase sequence, turning that author's infamous cojones and humorlessness into something side-splitting.<br />In spite of her inner urgings, which are brought out most forcefully in this novel, Granny Weatherwax is her usual sour but fundamentally decent self, making us prefer her direct tactlessness to her sister's slick manipulation.  \\"Tact\\" is something Granny ignores.  She perpetrates every paranoid suspicion generated by \\"ugly American\\" tourists and their British counterparts, and I've met both kinds while traveling in Europe.  Nanny Ogg is almost too eager to communicate, and too certain of her \\"forn\\" vocabulary.  Her malapropisms of languages and cuisine (crap suzette, anyone?) had me collapsing with laughter.  Magrat, who for the most part bids farewell to the subseries after the next book, LORDS & LADIES, may be a wet hen but begins to show some mettle.  Certainly she demonstrates good sense when she objects to the servant girl's name, Emberella, as sounding like \\"something you'd put up to keep the rain off.\\"<br />There's so much more that will keep you giggling -- a continuation of Pratchett's dwarf bread jokes, Greebo the Cat's amazing transformation, Nanny's introduction to the very short great lover Casanunda (whose name is one of of Pratchett's best puns).  All in all, WITCHES ABROAD would make a wonderful Christmas present for anyone who needs cheering up.

The story is so obvious.

It left me wondering what had happened to the humanistic Mr. Pratchett this go-around. Usually I'm very fond of the \\"Death\\" and \\"Susan\\" books, but not this one.

One of Amelia's most endearing qualities has always been her eccentric attitude toward motherhood and children.  Sometimes she reminded me of a female W.C. Fields.<br />We could have used a lot more of that refreshing sarcasm in CHILDREN OF THE STORM, especially during the genealogically bewildering and slow-moving first part. Since Peters is technically a good writer, the second half moved a little better -- but it never came close to the wit and magic and fine character development of the first Peabody story, CROCODILE ON THE SANDBANK, which, after ten or more re-readings, still makes me cheer the heroes.  Even so, despite the excellence of the first book, the series kept getting more and more delicious until its high point in the grand H. Rider Haggard pastiche, THE LAST CAMEL DIED AT NOON, which had me rolling on the floor with laughter and bug-eyed from all the cliff-hanging thrills.  Since then -- especially since Abdullah's death -- there's been so much soap opera you have to run to escape drowning in the frothy bubbles.  Making Sethos into a hero and a family member was as big a mistake as THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK turning Darth Vader into Luke's Sweet Li'l Ole Reedemable Daddy.  And just about as convincing.<br />I was especially disappointed in this book, though, and can't imagine how a new reader of the series could have tolerated it for ten minutes.  Leave the kiddies in England, Amelia, and let's have more of your tomb-crawling and umbrella-bashing.	2003-11-08

It's absolutely superb -- better than MAURICE/RODENTS and right up there with GUARDS! GUARDS!, CARPE JUGULUM, REAPER MAN, THE FIFTH ELEPHANT and all the really top-notch Discworld novels that I adore (i.e., all the ones without Rincewind).  The difference is that this tale will appeal to youngsters as well as to old-timers like me.  It has the wit, intricate plot, fast pace, wordplay, gentle ethnic satire, sturdy young person with wisdom far beyond her years, scary scenes and magically vivid descriptions we've come to expect from our Terry. In other words, it's just about perfect.<br />I came away actually liking the Nac Mac Feegle, who have been for the most part caricatures in previous books.  And, like a light-bulb flashing on, I now understand that on Discworld sorcerers are mostly flummerers (except for a couple of likeable experimenters) but witches -- THEY are the Discworld scientists!<br />Very seldom do I buy a hardbook book.  You wouldn't either if you had arthritic fingers as painful as mine.  But this one I couldn't resist, and I can hardly wait till September 30th for the long-desired paperback release of Pratchett's THE NIGHT WATCH!	2003-09-10

Perdue's skill at depicting fiction is appalling.  Every character is a cliche; you can visualize Cardinal Braun twirling a Snidely Whiplash mustache.  They all preach at each other for twenty paragraphs rather than talk as normal folk do.  The two main protagonists, a husband and wife, seldom do anything that isn't incredibly dumb.  They're running from killers.  Didn't either of them ever hear of using disguises -- dyeing their hair or donning bulky coats and hoods in snowy Switzerland and Austria?  Or of losing their names and taking aliases?  Or, most especially, not walking straight into trouble every twenty minutes?<br />On the other hand this old medievalist was interested to note that Perdue had done more homework than is usual in a hack work like this.  He had obviously studied early Christian Platonism and Gnosticism, and the political chicanery of Constantine.  True, some of the scholarly sources were poor choices.  The far-out goddess theories of the late Marja Gimbutas back up Perdue's explanation of ancient religion.  Contrary to Perdue's diatribes, sex orgies were a preoccupation of Renaissance popes, not Medieval ones. After the reform movement of the 10th century until the 14th, very rarely was any pontiff even accused of sexual depravity -- much less proven to be depraved.  In a more modern light, why would Hitler have bothered to blackmail Pius XII when Pius and his papal predecessors were a root cause of European antisemitism?  There are plenty of balanced books dealing with that horror without tainting their arguments with anticatholicism. Read Kertzer's THE POPE AGAINST THE JEWS or Catholic author Cornwell's HITLER'S POPE.<br />On the other hand, the preachy dialogues do sometimes convey interesting thoughts.  I found myself agreeing with the religiously liberal sentiments expressed in thisbook, and would have enjoyed reading these pleas for tolerance, religious democracy, female-male equality, and genuine faith as opposed to rigid religiosity in a NON-fictional setting.  How jarring it is in the context of a thriller, when a discussion of faith and ethics suddenly darts back to the main plot, a silly \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" chase after a miraculous shroud plus eyewitness(!) \\"proof\\" of a female messiah, or even worse, to an unnecessarily gory description of someone's head being blown off.  Please!  Slasher novels do not mix with a discussion of morality. <br />Furthermore, an author who aspires to teach morality should not express the hysterical anticatholicism that surfaces too often in DAUGHTER OF GOD, and that I (a non-Catholic) found offensive.  We can and should freely criticize any human institution -- church, state, or private -- but showing the world one's prejudices does nothing for the cause of tolerance.  Strangely, Perdue doesn't seem to realize that several free churches have championed anticlerical, non-institutional, broadly tolerant religion and women's rights for a very long time, including my own Unitarian Universalist faith.   <br />I could see that certain authors might give us a good, even great, story with the plot elements of DAUGHTER OF GOD. Theodore Sturgeon, Italo Calvino and Nikos Kazantzakis could have, and among living authors, Umberto Eco and perhaps Kurt Vonnegut.  I give Perdue credit for trying to state something important that simply eluded his ability, and would never work in the context of a thriller.  Perdue's attempt is simply too uneven and disjointed to have any merit.  One of the noted teachers of my own faith, Ralph Waldo Emerson, wrote: \\"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\\"  Had he waded through this novelistic mess, he might have added an \\"in-\\" before the word \\"consistency\\"!	2003-08-29

Is it the Klingons themselves who are boring?  Or just novels about them?  Though I enjoyed watching Hertzler's interpretation of Martok in the TV series DS9, I found his book tedious and never continued into the second book.<br />Let's face it, although TV and novel scripters try to make Worf and Martok a bit different, Klingons are flat, comic-book Hulks who, in real life, probably would have killed each other off in the Stone Age and certainly wouldn't have achieved interstellar space flight (Romulans or no).  Tales of Klingons involve one battle after another, each one as utterly boring as the battle at the end of STAR WARS 1977 that put me to sleep.  Their social manners should be kept cooped up inside an insane asylum.<br />They're not quite so boring as the faceless Borg or Jem'Hadar, but pretty close.

My biggest problem with it was that I couldn't figure out any possible scientific explanation for the \\"dimensional regression\\" caused by the Cathdral/Anathema, although the stories told of Julian's, Ezri's and Nog's past were well done and ultimately triumphant.  Even if the latter two were more-or-less reiterations of DS9 shows, we learn more about Dr. Bashir \\"Jules\\" than we knew, and the denouement of that story is particularly satisfying.<br />If you decide to accept some suspicious science, however, the story moves right along, the characterization is top-notch, and I especially liked the authors' understanding of politics -- how do you tell the good guys from the bad guys? can you stop politics from constantly changing? how do you avoid being suckered by plausible protestations of a superficially apparent \\"good-guy\\"?  A rich and deeply understood Realpolitik was always DS9's greatest strength -- one of reasons why I loved it far more than any other Star Trek series.  Genuine DS9 fans will love this book.  A warning to others: Don't look for Gene Roddenberry's rather simple-minded Federation that seems to run on stardust and permanent good-will.  The Cathedral alien and the Bajoran-Federation-Cardassian conflicts are as confusing, fascinating, and dangerous as today's headlines.<br />Very well done indeed!	2003-08-10

The first three books in this series were superb, especially Book Two, MISSION GAMMA: THIS GRAY SPIRIT, by writing neophyte Heather Jarman (more!  more!).  Book Four seemed to have been written on the back of old scratch pads on a commuter train, as if the author couldn't wait to end it.  The story moves along, but moves far too fast.  There was little character development, and what little there was tended to be sketchily drawn or reflect negatively on characters like Vaughn.<br />And God forbid, they brought the Borg back in to assimilate what might otherwise have been a good novel.  Haven't they learned?  The Borg were the most snoring-boring of all Star Trek villains, among whom only Hugh on TNG and those semi-Borgs on VOYAGER remain somewhat interesting.  I couldn't stand &quot;Seven of Nine&quot; and never again watched Voyager after Kes departed.  The &quot;Borg Queen&quot; in the Star Trek movie FIRST CONTACT was downright embarrassing, the concept unworthy of intelligent life.  As for Picard as a temporary Borg, give me TNG's THE INNER LIGHT any old time. The only good thing ever to result from the Borg was actress Alfre Woodard's comment in FIRST CONTACT:  &quot;Borg?  Sounds Swedish.&quot;  It cracked up the theater audience, including me.<br />Unfortunately there's nothing as impressive as that quip in this novel.  The author's credentials are not given, and I am hoping he decides not to write any more DS9 novels.	2003-08-10

I've been a long-time fan of Gregory Benford's hard sci-fi, ever since ACROSS THE SEA OF STARS.  I love the Galactic Center space operas, all of which should be reprinted, and TIMESCAPE is one of the 4 or 5 best science fiction novels ever written.  But COSM isn't worth reading.  It bombed as badly as Robert Heinlein's later diatribes and for the same reasons.<br />The science in this book seemed unlikely, and the endless university chicaneries grew boring (maybe because I have some experience with university teaching and was married to a physicist for 20 years who was for a while a university professor), but chiefly I found the people entirely deficient.  Alicia's characterization was implausible and even embarrassing.  Perhaps it's too much to ask a male white man who's spent much of his life south of the Mason-Dixon line to develop an African-American female protagonist adequately, and Benford shouldn't bite off more than he can chew.<br />Primarily it seemed that Alicia was merely a mouthpiece for Benford's increasingly erratic political balderdash.  Does Benford REALLY believe that Republicans are more likely to be friendly to scientists than Democrats??!!  Hasn't he noticed the astrologers, pseudo-scientist \\"creationists,\\" and Second Coming true-believers who have been running around the White House in every Republican administration since Reagan's?  I blame these power-hungry free-marketeers, with considerable help from fuzzy-thinking New Agers, for the pathetic and dangerous demolition of rational thinking in the U.S. over the last 25 years.<br />I began to think:  The author of TIMESCAPE gave us one of the most intelligent novels ever written about real scientists, worthy of C.P. Snow, and a plot expressing profound knowledge and sensitivity about the dying world that Benford's Republican \\"friends\\" are currently devolving us into. How can Gregory Benford have descended into such drivel as the political notions in COSM?  This is as tragic as Bob Heinlein's Ayn Randian (in other words, brain-dead), militaristic late novels.  Fortunately Heinlein gave me all those wonderful early idea-brilliant stories from 1939's BEYOND THIS HORIZON to all those \\"juveniles\\" I devoured as a high school girl, inspiring me to be the best and most grown-up woman I could become, starting me on an undeviating path toward rationality, a passion for knowledge and social responsibility.<br />I know that Benford's TIMESCAPE did the same for young people who came along after my day, because several have told me so.  I can only hope that they recognize this author's slide and fall from common sense.  Reading the other reviews of this worthless novel, COSM, I am convinced that many of them do.	2003-07-25

I looked forward to a Sheffield novel or novelette every year or so.  Some say he wrote space opera--but if so, it was a superior kind.  COLD AS ICE, set in the near-future solar system and something like a sequel to THE JUPITER PROJECT, is less of a space opera than, say, Sheffield's \\"Convergence\\" tales.  I read it years ago and reread it last week before going on to its 2002 sequel, DARK AS DAY.  Sheffield's last book is quite good after a somewhat frivolous start, grows better with each chapter, and I genuinely recommend it, but COLD AS ICE remains my personal favorite of all his longer fiction.<br />Sheffield had the mind of a scientist, a waggish wit, and the soul of a poet--a rare combination in science-fiction, which has been able to attract writers of significance like Ted Sturgeon, humorists as prolific as Ron Goulart and Terry Pratchett, and scientists like Gregory Benford, but seldom has the genre had an author whose elements were so mix'd as in Charles Sheffield, enabling us to shout, \\"This was a writer!\\"  Sheffield's poetic diction and irrepressible wit probably emerged from his own temperament.  He seems to have been a glorious romantic who had next to no male supremacy hangups.  \\"At the Eschaton,\\" a novelette that whirls us, a la Olaf Stapledon, from our time to the far distant future, is the most genuinely romantic work ever to emerge out of science-fiction, a mind-blowing exploration of \\"eternal love.\\" It remains the best sci-fi short novel I've ever read (although the novel-length expansion was one of Sheffield's lesser efforts).<br />In a different way COLD AS ICE is also a superb romance, with realistic, sometimes imperfect, relationships of many kinds, from friendship to love(both mature and immature).  While these interactions are building, the action never for a moment lets up, and the science, while cutting-edge, is extrapolated from current physical theories. The setting, mainly on Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa, is deliciously described and the preservation of Europa from human contamination has resonance for our time.  It's a slam-bang adventure tale, with (as usual in Sheffield) a mystery to be solved.  But most of all I appreciate Sheffield's subtle, realistic, and warm humans in this fine book--something, alas, Arthur Clarke has never achieved.  Humans like \\"Megachirops\\" the Great Bat, a fat and sometimes too-arrogant genius (whom we met in THE JUPITER PROJECT and who shows up for a third appearance in DARK AS DAY, I'm happy to report), the three young people of special talents whose mystery is the backbone of the book, and even the lesser characters. <br />It's correct to call this a next-step-in-human evolution novel, but it takes evolution in small steps--don't look for CHILDHOOD'S END or BLOOD MUSIC.  In Sheffield's mature stories the main characters may be superior but are never one-dimensional.  Like Bat, they are quite fallible.  The up-and-coming young sci-fi novelist, Peter Hamilton, could learn a lot by studying Sheffield's books.  Hamilton's space-operatic \\"Confederation\\" series shows promise, but the hero is too much a universal genius to be true, and ultimately he becomes a crashing bore.  Sheffield never bored us.  I don't want to believe he's gone!	2003-07-24

I'm a sci-fi and fantasy fan(atic) of over 50 years, devouring 2 to 3 genre books a week plus magazines like F&SF, but curiously, I hadn't run across Kevin Anderson before picking up CAPTAIN NEMO in a bookstore.  Just lucky, I guess.<br />The reviews sprinkled on the back cover were selected to impress suckers (like me), and although the novel's premise sounded like fun, believe me, it wasn't.  If you are looking for a dull, plodding story with nonsensical science, ungrammatical English, zero-dimensional characters, switching (and confusing) viewpoints, embarrassing name-dropping from Jules Verne's stories, contextually meaningless action scenes, and every other amateur mistake a writer could make, then read CAPTAIN NEMO.  As a kid, I read pulp magazine space-opera better written than this!<br />Anderson should either go to writers' school or retire.  There are so many truly outstanding sci-fi/fantasy writers to choose from -- contemporaries like Charles Sheffield, Terry Pratchett, Orson Scott Card, Gene Wolfe, Octavia Butler, Greg Bear, and Ursula LeGuin; older ones like Alfred Bester, Bob Heinlein, Fredric Brown, Sprague DeCamp, Jack Vance, Samuel Delaney, J.R.R. Tolkien, etc., etc., including of course Jules Verne.  Why should anyone bother with drivel like CAPTAIN NEMO?  You're much better off spending your money to see the cartoon movie about a little fish named Nemo.	2003-07-12

Robinson is a playwright as well as a masterful actor.  His writing ability shines in this wonderful novel based on the best of all the STAR TREK series.  Did I like DEEP SPACE NINE?  Well, the proof's in what happened after DS9 went off the air. I haven't watched anything since more than once or twice, and am purchasing all the DS9 videotapes.  I wouldn't dream of going to that expense for any other TV show.<br />Garak wasn't the only complex and well-drawn character on DS9--most of them were, thus the show's appeal--but he was certainly one of the more interesting ones.  Garak began as an occasional secondary character on DS9 (was he a spy or wasn't he??) and from the outset was so well-portrayed by Andrew Robinson that the writers included him into the plots more and more as the series progressed.  At the end Robinson should have received lead billing, since we saw him more often than Cirroc Lofton, the talented teenager who played Jake Sisko.<br />Watching Robinson's subtle acting, I realized that he'd given much thought to a deeply psychological characterization of Garak, and am very grateful that he finally has had the chance to pour it all out on paper in this terrific book, A STITCH IN TIME, which I could compare favorably with Gene Wolfe's \\"New Sun\\" novels, recording the life of Severian, ex-torturer's apprentice, whom Garak resembles in many ways.  I've read a few other DS9 novels, none of them even close to this one in the qualities that make a good novel.  The only quibble, if it really is one, is that a reader totally unfamiliar with DS9 might be a little bewildered at the outset. Any reader, however, can get into it, and once beyond the first few pages I guarantee he or she will be mesmerized.  That's because Robinson has produced a genuine novel, not hackwork.  The writing style has a Wolfean quality to it, both wonderfully descriptive yet surreal.  Garak, the ultimate cynic, shows us how manipulation corrupts, that the moral imperative of nationalist patriotism too often erodes the greater moral good of conscience.  We understand his need to reconcile himself to a shameful past in order to continue living, we sorrow with him at the destruction of everything familiar, and we are inside his mind as he grows and changes and finally learns from his harrowing experiences.  This book packs a wallop.	2003-07-12

On this rereading, I was amazed at how many of the wondrous stories I remembered, along with the gorgeous writing (in William Weaver's colloquial translation), the irony, the frequent hilarity, the many adroit and startling insights. The two tales I'd taken to heart back in the 80s, THE DINOSAURS and THE SPIRAL, turned out to be my favorites still. <BR>The first, with its wrenching surreal last line, you might call an \\"animal fable,\\" but it's not so much about the last dinosaur living among mammalian critters as it is about the eternal outsider, the stranger in a strange land. Most of Calvino's stories have as their protagonist a shy, fumbling, fussy, nerdy sort of being, the eternal academic male whom the author names \\"Qfwfq,\\" an unpronounceable palindrome that is a witty lampoon of alien names in 1930s pulp magazine space opera. Whether in the form of protean energy, protoplasm or dinosaurian scales, Qfwfq is different from everyone else--sometimes selfish, irascible, petty, revenge-plotting and jealous--but always different. And recognizable. And despite all his faults, worth forgiving and loving. <BR>In THE SPIRAL our eternal being is a conch under a shallow sea, who under a compulsion both joyous and anxious builds around himself the universe's first shell, demonstrating that art combines showing-off with longing and desire, and that love expressed as desire is the source of great art. Love is Calvino's other great theme. His lover (Qfwfq) is often fatuous, frequently engaged in futile pursuits, sometimes (I say regretfully, being a woman) sexist, but more than anything steadfast. I am reasonably sure, having read other books of his, that during his lifetime he believed that the universe was born from love and longing. Though shapes and intelligences, comprehensions and artifacts have evolved, love somehow manifests itself up through time in much the same as-yet unfulfilled and puzzling way. No orthodox theology can explain this--but only a theology called \\"panentheism\\" or process philosophy, that I believe Calvino and I share. The only God I (and, I presume, Calvino) could believe in is one that gave life to a universe in continual evolution--otherwise, how to explain art, science, free will--and love?	2003-06-10

I found no gross fault with Robb's historical research, though it seemed lightweight and out-of-date, but decided that she simply can't write her way out of a paper bag.<br />I thought that perhaps this book, set in Scotland in the marvelous year of 1297 -- the year of Wallace's victory at Stirling Bridge -- might be a good deal better, but A TRUST BETRAYED is a dud.  It's not the worst historical novel I've ever read (she at least avoided the plunging neckline cliches, and the utterly horrible historical mistakes of BRAVEHEART and ROBERT BRUCE, certainly the most asinine movies ever made about Scots history), but Robb's tedious writing style hasn't improved and she has nothing to say.  It took me nearly five days to finish a book that should have been digested in a day, and then I wondered why I'd bothered.  Margaret Kerr is unbelievably irritating.  She's superficially pious--did I ever get tired of all the masses and praying!--but so what?  She's a manipulator, a whiner, a sniveling weeper and a cynic.  Probably Robb doesn't realize just how unpleasant her main protagonist is.  But then, everyone in this story is unpleasant.  Perhaps Robb doesn't like Scots.  She certainly doesn't give us any likeable or interesting ones.<br />What kind of \\"mystery\\" is this when the primary dead guy turns out to have been himself a weak manipulator?  Where the main character's quest--don't laugh!--involves chasing after her husband, whom she doesn't love (or maybe she does), and never catching him?  Where her presumably beloved uncle acts like a grouchy ass and says not once but fifteen times, \\"You should not be here\\" or words to that effect?  Where the leading Scotsin this crucial year, namely William Wallace, John Comyn, Bishop Wishart and young Robert Bruce (please, not \\"THE Bruce\\", Candace!) never appear at all, and where no important English historical figures enter the story either, except by being distantly mentioned?<br />Historically it is less accurate than it should be.  Church law permitted disobedience to grossly illegal or immoral orders of a superior, even as the code of chivalry did, so Andrew comes across as a wimp.  Why name a woman character \\"Tess\\" when the name \\"Teresa\\" was unknown in the British Isles until the cult of Teresa of Avila (1515-1582) spread throughout Europe?  That's as anachronistic as putting Gypsies or a \\"witch\\" coven into 13th century Scotland.  And why do we hear about the bloody events at Lanark at a distance?  Wherever Margaret is, we can be damn sure that NOTHING important happens!<br />The problem with this book isn't that it's a worthless mystery, or that there are historial boo-boos, though these both are exasperating.  The problem is that it's much ado about nothing.  It might have made a decent short story--but it just hasn't enough substance for a novel.	2003-06-10

You can forgive the children, but the adults, too? They probably believe in Santa and the Easter Bunny.  Their stupidity eroded the novel's verisimilitude and is personally irritating to me.  Gullible sympathetic chacters are unwelcome in our sad era of New Age and Fundamentalist nonsense, when far too many people...have lost the commonsense ability to be skeptical.<br />That cavil aside, once you accept that the characters aren't really very bright, this is a truly well-written and sensitive fantasy, with astonishing insights into the concerns and teenage girls...Furthermore, TAMSIN warmed the heart of this old medievalist.

I've read and thoroughly enjoyed all the Russell-Holmes novels, starting with THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE, the best of this series and one of the most wondrous exercises in &quot;what if&quot; ever composed.  I also greatly admire A MONSTROUS REGIMENT OF WOMEN and O JERUSALEM.<br />This latest book (like Peters' last Amelia Peabody novel) feels slightly tired, with a plot that repeats the past too much and, even worse, deals almost exclusively with the aristocracy and not with the whole spectrum of society, as do King's other novels of the series.  I also found the two cousins a bit unreal in this book--as they definitely were not in O JERUSALEM. Nor was this the outraged indictment of British leadership in World War One, as one of the blurbs led me to believe.  If you want a savage treatment of that in mystery format, go to other authors, especially to Reginald Hill's THE WOOD BEYOND.<br />However, all criticism aside,  King remains one of the most skillful and intelligent novelists writing today.  Her characters, especially Holmes, contain all the quirks of inconsistency we find in people yet maintain sympathy.  Her descriptions are unsurpassed and the scope of her learning takes my breath away.  So--I do hope you'll choose an earthier plot next time around, Laurie, but even this novel, the least of the series, is better than most mysteries!	2003-05-18
US	41154417	R1DZVKSJV9YVF0	0449213013	750649906	Earth Abides	Books	4	515	549	N	N	One of the Most Memorable Books I've Read	When I write &quot;one of the most memorable books I've read,&quot; that's saying something, because I've kept up a pace of reading at least four books a week since before entering Kindergarten and am now 67. I borrowed EARTH ABIDES from the library a year after it came out, in 1950, when I was a 14-year-old high school sophomore, reading everything and anything labeled &quot;science fiction.&quot; I didn't own the book until fairly recently, but it stayed vividly in my memory.  I could call up characters like fussy Maureen, stolid George, loyal Em and the tragic genius child, Joey. I remembered the fascinating journey across America, the vague frustration I felt (even so young) over Ish's passive character and the generally negative slide of the tribe from scavenging off civilization into what appeared almost to be an Upper Paleolithic lifestyle at the novel's end--not even qualifying as barbarism.<br />But it's Stewart's refusal to tread the usual Golden Age sci-fi path and make Ish a superscience hero that makes the novel very special.  Ish may be a scientist, he's academically bright, but like many people he's low in energy, street-smarts, and foresight.  By and large his motley clan possesses even lower survival skills.  They aren't much different from the Valley Girls in another good story in the end-of-the-world genre, the movie NIGHT OF THE COMET.  Both are based on an understanding that if the human race's average IQ is 100, half the people who are likely to survive a major disaster aren't going to be awfully competent.  Stewart certainly knew that, and it provided both the uncanny realism and the rather depressing pessimism of this story.  It's fascinating to note that the other reviewers have noted both aspects of EARTH ABIDES.	2003-05-18

This book is so terrific it amazes me that Pratchett & Gaiman haven't done another, but I guess they're too busy on their own projects.  I can't say anything that earlier reviewers haven't already said in praise of this hilarious and philosophically pointed novel--except to mention the wacky wordplay, very likely Terry Pratchett's.  As it happened, the first time I read the book I was studying the Welsh language and when I came across the quite authentic-sounding name of a Welsh town, Pant-y-Gyrdl, I nearly drowned in tears brought on by excessive laughter.  I suppose in our advanced era of Pant-y-Hos, that particular pun might go by without notice.  Too bad, but it's far from the only bit of wordplay that will make you giggle.   And sometimes stop and think, which is even nicer.	2003-05-18

At the age of three, 'way back in 1939, my parents brought me to Reelfoot Lake in the heart of the New Madrid fault country.  I've never forgetten the eerieness of that experience and look for books about the historical earthquake or sci-fi projections of future ones.  Most, like Hernon's 8.4, aren't any better written than a Robin Cook, but THE RIFT is different.  It's literature!<br />I am sure it's no accident that the plot is far more than a disaster novel.  It's a picaresque travel-tale and its structure parallels the greatest of all American novels, HUCKLEBERRY FINN, with a rebellious white boy and an intelligent black man confronting dangers and weirded-out characters on the Mississippi and along its banks, and finding great depths of resourcefulness in themselves, as well as friendship and trust. And you get a delicious sci-fi disaster story on top of all that!  Who could resist?<br />I've lived in the South about half my life and found the characters entirely believable.  Like Mark Twain, Williams shows us the murderous underside of fundamentalist religion, yet at the same time doesn't demonize the preacher and his surprisingly creative wife.  Murderous fanatics they turn out to be, but a lot more likeable than the Ku Kluxers and the drugged-out Militia creep from Detroit.  (I've lived in the Detroit area, too, and that little piece of smarm could be patterned after a few racist haters and baiters who got in the news.)  Yet even he is not without a soul.  Williams understands the politics of the American lumpenproletariat, the reasons for resentment and their unfortunate tendency to blame everyone but their genuine enemies.  So you get a political analysis, too.<br />Samuel Clemens, I am sure, must have read this novel in Heaven about as many times as I've read it down here.	2003-03-26
US	41154417	R2XBLM0BNGOJ9B	0151006903	99041831	Baudolino	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Vintage Eco--To Be Reread and Treasured	Umberto Eco's novels are so full of ideas that after finishing each of his three greatest ones--THE NAME OF THE ROSE, FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM, and now BAUDOLINO--I immediately read it again. THE NAME OF THE ROSE drew me because my own Medieval studies have focused on fourteenth century heresy and social justice movements, because I too love Sherlock Holmes and &quot;got&quot; the humorous references, and because Eco's heart and soul are so clearly liberal and humanist, my own chosen path through life.<br />The dazzling FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM, which I consider his greatest novelistic achievement, is the most penetrating study in fictional form of our sad and comical human propensity of drawing conclusions out of nothing more than our imagination--a view of history as the product of multiple con-games. Eco's latest, BAUDOLINO, follows in the path of FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM and is the wittiest of the three, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.  It has the ambience of a science fiction novel about &quot;wonders to be visited out there.&quot; Even so, its historical setting is real enough, the time of the Fourth Crusade and the destruction of Christian Constantinople, but like FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM, its primary theme is not history but the enormous power of the imagination to make history.<br />Although in third person, Baudolino, the greatest con-artist of all, is telling his story to another, much as Marco Polo did.  That's where his picaresque imagination takes off, and ours with him.  We travel from wartorn rural Italy to scholastic Paris, then on to Constantinople and a Central Asia of the imagination.  We meet the Old Man of the Mountain and his hashish-eating Assassins, and nearly all the strange human-monsters of Pliny and Mandeville, who in this novel have personalities and motivations that are quite human--but never the sought-after Prester John.  The conclusion is seamless with the story, and entirely satisfying. To present his hero's travels (and we are free to conclude that Baudolino never truly traveled anywhere beyond Constantinople except in his head), Eco weaves together the related Medieval accounts of Prester John, Sindbad the Sailor and Sir John de Mandeville, and to some extent stirs in Marco Polo. It's a wonderful conceit to make Baudolino and his friends the authors of Prester John's Letter--although in a fascinatingly roundabout way.<br />The Prester John, Sindbad and Mandeville legends clearly owe their wonders to Pliny the Elder's gullible reports of the Mysterious East.  Marco's travelogue is soberer, but many historians doubt that he ever went to China, and attribute the book to his father's and uncle's stories plus self-aggrandizing imagination.  Yes, we always come back to imagination!<br />BAUDOLINO is a troubling, joyous book, which is no contradiction.  It discloses every human weakness, but also every kind of courage and persistence.  It will cheer you and give you hope that dreams and imagination might just change history.	2003-02-23

While this was a reasonably good mystery with a likeable central character, I couldn't see any comparison to Pratchett, whose wit and human understanding are miles ahead of Hiassen's.  Perhaps this is one of Hiassen's weaker novels, or maybe--since I grew up in Miami and found it an atrocious city with the most miserable climate in the U.S.--I just don't relate to South Florida.

I recognize Owen Parry's Union officer, Abel Jones, as the counterpart of some of the sturdy people of that splendid land.  I've now read all three of Parry's Civil War mysteries available in paperback, and each new one has been better than the last.<br />The only mystery writers of comparable talent who've dissected the physical, mental and moral tragedy of war are Charles Todd and Reginald Hill.  But Parry, writing in the voice of a deeply religious, highly puritanical Welshman of the mid-Nineteenth Century, is unique. I doubt that there are very many better first-person stories out there in any genre.<br />The plot and characters of this latest novel have been covered by other reviewers (with whom I soundly agree).  I only want to suggest that if you haven't yet heard the voice of Abel Jones, go thou and do so.	2003-02-22

If you enjoy a cast of entirely conscienceless, immoral characters, a stultifying plot, and an easy-to-spot solution, be my guest.

The subplot destroys what could have been a good one.  So Kinsey's attracted to Tommy? I could not believe she would change that attraction to her dumb-dumb vigilante mode INSTANTLY--on the word of a total stranger! Why didn't she at least go to Texas and nose around? Then she wouldn't have been suckered by a femme fatale con artist, who herself was unreal. (The \\"insurance investigator\\" is so smart and sharp looking, but with a dumb low-life brother?? Come on.)<br />I guess Grafton wants us to think Kinsey's infallible, but no one is, and that's why we have a Constitution and courts, folks. Where's Grafton been? Last I heard, juries were convicting the retarded, the insane, and the innocent, and these poor (people) were getting death sentences--ESPECIALLY in Texas. Come into the real world, Sue.

Her amazing knowledge of the period, as if she'd time-traveled, is skilfully interwoven with the personal relationships among Falco, Helena, and Helena's extremely likeable brother.  She presents the Roman army's military ambitions (and snafus) with enough zest to awaken a love of history in all but the most jaded, and her portraits of Cerialis and the other high-rankers, both offstage and on, had me laughing out loud.<br />If you haven't studied Roman history, you can do it \\"fictionally\\"--starting out around 100 BC with Colleen McCullough's Marius-Sulla-Caesar novels (so superior to McCullough's THE \\"CORN\\" BIRDS), then going to Robert Graves' three Claudius books, which take you up to Nero (brrrr!), and finishing up with Lindsey Davis.

I didn't like Kinsey's insensitive right-wing \\"lawnorder\\" politics, and I was able to figure out who dunnit well before the book's conclusion.<br />However, commencing with B IS FOR BURGLAR (I'm now up to G) Sue Grafton has been characterizing Kinsey as tough and competent without making her into a tediously macho John Wayne with lipstick. Best of all, this one's a rare mystery that throws out all the clues honestly and still remains tantalizingly mysterious until the last few pages. What a joy!

My period is largely the Fourteenth Century, but. . . my mother was an avid amateur Tudor scholar, so I grew up well acquainted with Sixteenth Century England.  Furthermore, the Butlers of Ormond (why add an \\"e\\", Harper?) are one of my primary subspecialties.  I could give you details of the careers of the first two Earls of Ormond and have visited all the castles and other sites in Munster associated with them.<br />This book falls flat since its main premise is bewildering.  Here's the real story.  Anne Boleyn was half-Butler (if Harper ever tells us this, I missed it). She was a granddaughter of the last Earl of Ormond of the original line, who died in 1515 without male heirs.  Both Piers Butler, a distant part-Irish cousin, and Thomas Boleyn, Anne's father, who had married the late Earl's co-heiress, made claims for the earldom.  These came to naught because viciously anti-feminist law which had arisen during the Renaissance had wiped out the ancient Anglo-Norman partible inheritance by daughters.  By law, Henry VIII had no choice but to dissolve the earldom for want of heirs.<br />In 1528 Henry created Piers Butler as Earl of Ossory, and a year later awarded a NEW Earldom of Ormond (in England as well as Ireland) to Anne's brother Thomas.  One could imagine the outrage of Piers Butler and his family over this action. . . but even before Anne's downfall in 1536, Thomas surrendered the IRISH portion of the earldom to Piers Butler.  This grant was confirmed a few months after the execution of Anne and her brother--and years before the date of Harper's story!  On Piers' death about a year later, his son James became Earl, fully restored under the original grant made by Edward III to the first James Butler in 1328. <br />Harper made no effort to bring in these fascinating details, which, at best, could have greatly enriched her story--at worst, would have ruined it.  Instead, she makes far too much of the broken betrothal between Anne and Piers' Butler's son.  No wonder she made her murderess insane!  Otherwise there could have been scant motive for her plot.<br />Please.  Aren't outrageously unhistorical movies like MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS and (worst of all) BRAVEHEART bad enough?  Are we now being offered inaccurate or incomplete history in print?<br />PS: During her long reign Elizabeth favored the Butlers of Ireland, and flirted with handsome \\"Black Tom\\" Butler, Duke and Earl of Ormond, who gussied up one of his castles in anticipation of a visit to Ireland which the queen never made.	2002-06-03

Other reviewers have commented on the soap opera romance aspect of this novel, so I'd like to direct my criticism to Harper's knowledge of history, or lack thereof, and to her style.<br />First, her history. The first novel in the series was bad enough, with not the slightest mention that Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth's mother, was herself a Butler of Ormond! The princess's erstwhile murderer would, therefore, have been a cousin, and letting the reader in on their relationship would have deepened and enriched the story.<br />But that's a mere quibble. On page 238 of THE TWYLIGHT TOWER, Elizabeth says, in reference to the founding of the Order of the Garter, \\"I'll tell you one thing about King Edward III, who began this nearly six centuries ago. . .\\"<br />As a student of the Fourteenth Century, I gritted my teeth on reading so crass a mistake. The Garter's founding is sightly uncertain, but the Order was founded (indeed, by Edward III) some time between 1344 and 1348. Now, simple subtraction from 1560 gives us a difference of little more than 200 years, not 600. I thought the error might be a strange typo--perhaps originally \\"200\\" mistakenly typed as \\"600\\" and then editorially spelled out. But it is Harper's mistake. Two pages later Robert Dudley (perhaps addled by lust!) refers to the founding as occurring \\"hundreds of years ago.\\"<br />At that point I felt like throwing an ink bottle at Karen Harper. No one so ignorant of history should be writing a novel purporting to be \\"historical.\\"<br />As for style, Harper is too often guilty of indulging in the \\"forsooth school\\" of dialogue (Josephine Tey's term), yet is maddeningly inconsistent in her use of historically correct grammar. Since I believe that she is an English teacher, she is surprisingly ignorant of extant older grammatical forms. Here lapses are manifold, and include using the indicative rather than the subjunctive mode (\\"if it was\\" rather than \\"if it were\\") and \\"like\\" instead of \\"such as\\" in a phrase containing a verb.<br />Picky, perhaps, but such Americanisms are quite destructive of the novel's verisimiliatude. Are her characters Elizabethans--or modern Americans speaking U.S. English?<br />My recommendation is to avoid these novels...	2002-06-01

Teppic is a great guy who grows up as we read.  The very name of Teppic's country, Djelibeybi, made me giggle, and the final exam in the Assassins' School had me at the edge of my chair until Teppic -- whew! -- makes the right decision. It's fun to look for the sources of Pratchett's plots (and satires).  Did anyone else notice the similarities between this one and the first two of the Gormenghast trilogy?  Not just Daddy's becoming a bird, but the dark ambience, Teppic's strange rivals and relatives, and the liberating finale.  This book isn't my absolute favorite of Pratchett's (those accolades are reserved for the Watch novels and REAPER MAN), but it's a far cut above the Rincewind tales -- and better than the Gormenghast novels, since it examines all problems, including the hilarious ones, that trouble the inheritor of vast inbred territories.	2002-04-17

GUARDS!, which is the first novel of the series and the first Pratchett book I ever read. In the first two, GUARDS! GUARDS! and MEN AT ARMS, Sam Vimes meets and marries the Dragon Lady, Sibyl Ramkin, and we get the most loving satire of a formidable upper-class old maid that I've ever read. Their romance is as unlikely and as touching as the one between Death and Miss Flitworth in REAPER MAN.<br />I loved the affirmative action developments in the second book, though the dragon plot in the first one seems almost superfluous compared to the evolution of Vimes' character from the time we meet him drunk in the gutter to the changes Sybil helps bring about -- and we read the subsequent Watch novels in wonder as Sam goes on to become a reluctant knight, then a duke and an expectant dad.  Equally fascinating are Angua the werewolf and Cheery Littlebottom the dwarf, two of the new \\"men\\" at arms whom we get to know better in each book.  Even Carrot, who is usually too good to be interesting, starts to develop some fascinating flaws in THE FIFTH ELEPHANT.<br />That's the joy of the Watch novels, as well as the Witch and Death ones, and a few one-shot protagonists like Teppic in PYRAMIDS. Here are people who change and evolve, in other words, people who come alive. (Even Death does -- wonderfully.) Although the password scene at the beginning of GUARDS! GUARDS! is one of Pratchett's funniest, there is none of the sneering and lampooning that make the Rincewind stories tedious. I am ever so glad that this was the first Pratchett book I read; had it been one of the Rincewind stories, chances are I'd never have gone back to the PRA's on the bookstore shelves.	2002-04-17

This autobiographical tale told by one of two young American sisters on a year-long vacation in Italy in 1938 was a non-stop read for me. I couldn't put it down. How much of it was written by Becky Landrum, how much by her son Michael, is anybody's guess because the story is seamless, but my estimate is that most of it is Becky's, not only because she is listed as lead author but because it has the quality of a journal--not one of the academic and pretentious travel journals of Henry Adams and his ilk, but the kind you or I might keep: innocent, unafraid to report embarrassing and potentially dangerous situations, eager to take a childlike joy in new sights and new people.<br />Let's critique it first and get that out of the way. My criticism doesn't amount to much. Perhaps being overly faithful to a girlish diary, the book has a few too many modifiers, many of which could have been deleted, and there are some misspellings and typos--usually duplicated or misplaced commas or periods. But in our age of spell checkers, we're lucky to get as clean a copy as this. I didn't see a single \\"not\\" for \\"now\\" or vice versa, or any other horror affecting our understanding of the text.<br />Becky's succinct prose, while not polished and professional, was the perfect way to tell her story. (Here the trip diary worked for the narrative in a positive way.) In 216 pages she offers a travelogue not only of Italy and a corner of Switzerland, but also of the train stops and ship ports between Joplin, Missouri and her dream vacation in Europe. Her description of the peoples and locales were right on the money. Once in Italy, her observations frequently made me laugh, not only her explanation of the meaning of \\"Americanata\\" (you should have the amusement of reading that for yourself) but also shrewd comments on society and the differentness of living in a foreign land.<br />I want to share two of these. The first appears on page 89, observations of a society \\"high tea\\" by a no-nonsense young woman from the American Midwest. No one could have better described the harried and underrated servants of prewar Europe:<br />\\"We were waited on by a starched, gloved, and uniformed team of servants who whirled silently around us as though on roller skates.\\"<br />Those not fortunate enough to have traveled in Italy have heard of its wild road traffic, yet the following passage on page 111 took me joyously by surprise and the final sentence must be one of the best one-liners I've ever read:<br />\\"[We sat] at a small outdoor café on a busy street. Bicycles made up half the traffic, and many of them were delivering merchandise. The most unusual were two men on bicycles holding an arm chair between them, balancing it like a circus act. It was the most entertaining traffic I had ever seen.\\"<br />The dark side of this tale is the presence of Mussolini, the rumbling backdrop of Hitler's thrust toward war, and the result it had on several of Becky's friends, including one young Englishman she fell half in love with. But by and large AMERICANATA is book full of joy, beauty, and rollicking good story-telling! Highly recommended.	2002-02-01
