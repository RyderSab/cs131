US	38577070	RYULBGXKJRHHI	0140298363	349365874	Mr. Phillips	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Horsemeat and Chips	...  <br />\\"Mr. Phillips\\" is a book in which almost nothing at all happens; it's one of those \\"he goes there and does this, then goes there and does that,\\" stories, yet it succeeds and it succeeds quite well, not because of John Lanchester's experience (this is only his second novel) but because of his enormous talent (this is, after all, the man who wrote the wickedly creative \\"The Debt to Pleasure\\").<br />Mr. Phillips is a man approaching middle age who suddenly finds himself out of a job.  Sure, it was a boring job, but Mr. Phillips counted on it...and so did his wife.  Unable to tell her what has happened, and perhaps unable to admit it even to himself, Mr. Phillips dresses for work each day, leaves the house at the appointed hour and then fritters away his time until he can safely return home again.  If this doesn't sound like much of a plot, you can be assured it isn't.  If it sounds boring, you can also be assured it isn't.<br />\\"Mr. Phillips\\" is a book that concerns itself with a single summer day in the life of the newly unemployed Mr. Phillips.  Although there isn't much plot to speak of, we do get a very good look into the thought processes of Mr. Phillips, himself.  By the time we finish the book we feel we know him better than we might know ourselves.<br />Mr. Phillips seems to be a man to whom strange things simply \\"happen.\\"  While he sets out to do nothing more exciting than roam around London, he become a witness to a bizarre display of sexual exhibitionism (on the bus, no less); he is almost \\"picked up\\" by a strange woman in the Tate Gallery; he visits a porn shop; he foils a bank robbery; and he has an encounter with an elderly woman with whom he discovers a connection.  Not bad for an unemployed, middle-aged man who, on the surface, appears more than a little colorless.<br />These events are no more or no less than...events.  But Lanchester is such a gifted writer and his insight into the psyche of Mr. Phillips is so witty and dead-on that we can't help but turn the pages eagerly, wanting to know more and more and more about this silly little man and why on earth he does what he does when he does it.<br />I know some people have been put off by the extremely arch tone Lanchester affected in \\"Mr. Phillips.\\"  I've read that some people find it distancing and felt it kept us from really getting to know Mr. Phillips.  I felt just the opposite.  I loved it and I thought it was brilliant of Lanchester to write the book in that manner.  Mr. Phillips is, of course, a man who would speak, and even think, in very arch tones, so Lanchester's choice made me feel I was getting to know Mr. Phillips even more intimately, not less.<br />I have also heard complaints that the real \\"issues\\" in Mr. Phillips' life, e.g., his physical decline, the loss of his job, his emotional distance from his family and friends, are not addressed completely enough and intimately enough in this book.  It's true, they are not addressed intimately, but once again, I have to applaud Lanchester's choice.  Mr. Phillips is a man who is distanced from himself.  His thought processes, which are what we're following in this book, simply would not, and could not, embrace his problems intimately.  Here is a man who leaves the house and roams London day after weary day simply because he can't face the fact that he's been sacked.  He certainly is not going to sit down and analyze the reasons why.  The further Mr. Phillips can get from his problems, the better he likes it.  In fact, he even entertains the notion of running away to Paris to eat \\"horsemeat and chips.\\"<br />I think Lanchester's decision not to address Mr. Phillips by his given name is also a wonderful one, although he does let us know he has one and what it is (it is Victor, by the way).<br />While \\"Mr. Phillips\\" isn't quite the masterpiece \\"The Debt to Pleasure\\" is (that is a once-in-a-lifetime book), it is a book filled with writing and characterization that most authors can only dream of achieving.  Lanchester is a man of enormous talent and creativity.  I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.	2002-05-24

No one is better than Murakami when it comes to writing about &quot;Everyman&quot; and I think that is one of the keys to his enormous popularity.  Even if you don't particularly care for his deadpan style, I don't think there's a person alive who can't identify, in some way, with the characters in his books.<br />&quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot; is no doubt Murakami's densest book to date and, if you're new to this author's works, I would recommend starting with something else first...perhaps &quot;South of the Border, West of the Sun&quot; or &quot;A Wild Sheep Chase.&quot;<br />&quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot; begins when its out-of-work, down-on-his-luck protagonist, Okada (this book's &quot;Everyman&quot;), lets a pot of spaghetti boil over, foils an obscene phone call, then takes a legitimate call from his wife, Kumiko, who asks him to look for their lost cat, Norboru Wataya.  Norboru Wataya is named after Kumiko's politician brother and I really haven't figured out if that means Kumiko likes her brother or dislikes him.<br />Murakami's signature themes are alienation and loneliness and he makes great use of them in &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.&quot;  No matter how much Okada tries to &quot;fit in,&quot; he seems to be nothing more than a tourist in the landscape of life; characters drift in and out of his world as he searches for his own identity and a read sense of self.  The problem is, each of the characters Okada encounters is searching for something as well and each pulls Okada into his own dreamlike world, confusing the issues (and Okada) even further.<br />The characters that come to life in the pages of &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot; are as bizarre as any Murakami has ever created.  There is May Kasahara, Okada's sixteen year old &quot;Lolita&quot; typeneighbor; Creta and Malta Kano, two psychics; and Lieutenant Mamiya, a man who tells a fascinating tale of wartime espionage, a tale that may hold the key to the heart of &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.&quot;  Lt. Mamiya is a man who has spent time at the bottom of a well, and spending time at the bottom of a well is an experience that will eventually change Okada's life and confer upon him a strange, metaphysical openness.<br />Murakami juxtaposes the bizarre and the mundane better than any author I have ever read and he does so in such a way as to render the bizarre totally acceptable, and, yes, sometimes even mundane.  His books usually don't have meaning, but then life doesn't always have meaning, say Murakami's characters.  If it's meaning you're looking for, you'd better look elsewhere.<br />Murakami writes in a curious deadpan tone that is reminiscent of the very best detective stories and his books are, to some degree, detective stories themselves.  They could take place anywhere; there is nothing in them to identify them as uniquely Japanese.  If you're looking for classical Japanese literature, Kawabata, Abe or Mishima would be a far better choice.  Murakami is totally modern in flavor.<br />Although this book, at first glance, may seem to be light it is anything but.  And, just as life fails to answer all our questions, so does Murakami.  Although this book is dense and complex, it leaves a lot unaccounted for.  There are some things, Murakami seems to be telling us, that simply don't have answers.  Or perhaps they simply don't require them.	2002-05-24

And, I'm happy to say, we usually agree on what's good and what's not so good.  Although my friend loves Gabriel Garcia Marquez, &quot;The General in His Labyrinth,&quot; however, is one book my friend didn't like and I did.<br />&quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; tells the story of the melancholy and sad final journey of General Simon Bolivar, fondly known as &quot;The Liberator&quot; in many South American countries.  Bolivar is the man who drove the Spanish from the northern part of South America during 1811-1824, even though the local aristocracy chose to fight against him.  In the end, he became a sad and defeated man, old before his time and burdened with the knowledge that his dream of a unified South America would not be realized during his lifetime.<br />Although Bolivar is revered in much of South America (and the world in general), his final days were quite unhappy.  In this book, Garcia Marquez takes us along with Bolivar on his final cruise along the Magdalena River from Colombia to the sea.  Bolivar was sad, disillusioned, in shock from the after effects of an assassination attempt and suffering from an unspecified illness; in short, this mythic man had become old at the very young age of forty-six.<br />After Bolivar had been denied the presidency of Colombia he decided to spend his final days in Europe, far away from political strife of any kind.  But Bolivar wouldn't have been Bolivar had he not given his life to the people.  His dreams of living in peace in Europe were dashed when the government that replaced him failed.<br />It didn't take years of history to make Bolivar larger than life.  He was larger then life to those who knew him intimately as well as to those who knew him only by reputation.  And no wonder...he possessed a terrible temper, a extraordinarily passionate nature and his political and leadership abilities were virtually unsurpassed.  Everyone paled next to Bolivar, in life just as (almost) everyone pales next to him in this book.  (His enemy, Santander, and his commander, Sucre, are two notable exceptions.  His lover, Manuela Saenz is also a well drawn character, but Bolivar's valet, Jose Palacios lets us know that, other than saving Bolivar from assassination, she was really nothing special, just one more lover among very many.)<br />I read, in a interview with Garcia Marquez, that the voyage along the Magdalena was chosen to be fictionalized since this was a little-known episode in a very publicly-lived life.  Personally, I think it was a wonderful choice.  The voyage was one that was no doubt filled with melancholy and nostalgia and no one writes of melancholy and nostalgia, especially South American melancholy and nostalgia, as well as does Garcia Marquez.  This is a book in which real memories become confused with the hallucinations of delirium, a confusion that is only enhanced by the descriptions of the steamy jungle interior.  The floods, the oppressive heat, the epidemics that Bolivar and his weary band of supporters encounter only serve to enhance &quot;The Liberator's&quot; own physical decline.<br />I also think that showing us Bolivar, not at the height of his glory, but at what was no doubt one of the lowest points of his life, was also a wonderful choice.  Bolivar was, apparently, a man of contradictions.  He was flamboyant and mythic, yet ultimately tragic; he could be elegant in public matters yet coarse in private; he was obviously a genius at strategy, yet his last days were filled with the incoherence of illness.  And, all along the way, through this maze of contradictions, Garcia Marquez never loses sight of the one driving force in Simon Bolivar's life:  his desire for a unified South America.<br />I also love the way Garcia Marquez twists and folds the narrative of this book until the reader isn't quite sure what's real and what's fevered hallucination; whatreally happened and what didn't.  Of course, Garcia Marquez is a master at just this sort of narrative and he really outdoes himself in this book.<br />In the end, Bolivar, himself, decides that South America is ungovernable; it is, he declared, a land that will inevitably fall into the hands of tyrants, both large and small.  Sadly, Bolivar's prophecy seems to be, at least in part, true.  And, even more sadly still, although the world has come to love and rever &quot;The Liberator,&quot; &quot;The Liberator,&quot; himself, died a sad and defeated man.t really happened and what didn't.

US	38577070	R1SVHFD3QR1N0D	0156010593	77621968	All the Names	Books	5	9	11	N	N	A Search for Connections	With the exception of \\"The Tale of the Unknown Island,\\" I've loved all of Jose Saramago's books.  Although my favorites are \\"The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis\\" and \\"Balthasar and Blimunda,\\" I think \\"All the Names\\" is just as deserving of five stars.<br />All the names concerns itself with a labyrinthine office called The Central Registry, a place where all births, marriages, deaths and whatever are diligently recorded and overseen by someone simply known as the Registrar, a person who obviously wields great power.  The Central Registry is a virtual maze of records.  In fact it's so huge that one poor genealogical researcher who ventured in simply couldn't find his way out.  Luckily, the man survived, but as Saramago tells us, \\"He was discovered...after a week, starving, thirsty, exhausted, delirious, having survived thanks to the desperate measures of ingesting enormous quantities of old documents...The head of the Central Registry, who, having given the man up for dead, had already ordered the imprudent historian's record card and file to be brought to his desk, decided to turn a blind eye to the damage.\\"<br />The protagonist of \\"All the Names,\\" is Senhor Jose, a rather insignificant clerk in the Central Registry, who really has very little life outside of his work.  His primary indulgence is his hobby:  collecting copies of the certificates of the more \\"famous\\" filed in the Central Registry along with newspaper clippings of the persons involved.<br />One day, as Senhor Jose is removing the certificates of several \\"celebrities,\\" he pulls an extra card by mistake.  This extra card belongs, not to a celebrity, but to a thirty-six year old woman whose identity is unknown.  It doesn't take Senhor Jose long to become obsessed with this woman and with the details that surround her life.  His quest for this unnamed woman leads Senhor Jose into waters he heretofore had been more than a little wary of treading.  In his search to know the object of his obsession, SenhorJose discovers that he, himself, is not quite who he thought he was.  He becomes a liar, a forger and a burglar, much to his surprise.  I won't tell you whether his revelations about himself please or dismay Senhor Jose, or whether he finds the woman, but I will tell you that the woman is not what he is ultimately looking for.  Suffice it to say that Senhor Jose emerges from his search a very different man from the one who began it, for this is a book of self-discovery and self-revelation.  It is an allegory of life and art and mortality of the highest order.<br />\\"All the Names\\" has an over-riding sardonic tone that is perfect for the subject matter involved.  It doesn't take an astute reader long to figure out that Senhor Jose is really Saramago, himself, and that the unnamed woman is but his elusive muse.  But does this muse exist in reality or only in imagination?  That is something you'll have to find out when you read the book for the end is a little surprising.<br />While I love Saramago's books, he can be a little heavy-handed at times.  This certainly isn't the case in \\"All the Names.\\"  This book has a comic lightness in its writing that reminded me a little of Milan Kundera.  But just a little.  Both Saramago and Kundera are extraordinarily original and creative and any comparison of the two would ultimately be grossly unfair.  Senhor Jose, though, is a wonderfully comic character and \\"All the Names\\" is a wonderfully comic and delicate book.  This is a book in which it would have been so easy to \\"get it wrong.\\"  Always the master, however, Saramago get it \\"all right.\\"<br />In the end, \\"All the Names\\" is a book that can really touch the heart.  It personifies, in the character of Senhor Jose, the search each of us makes for connections in life:  connections to the world, to something outside of ourselves, to other people.  It personifies our need for something permanent in our fragile lives and something we know we can hold onto...forever.	2002-05-23
US	38577070	R3PPW4YGE4RXM6	0375703845	939433309	Glamorama (Vintage Contemporaries)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	The People You Love to Hate	I'll admit it:  Bret Easton Ellis writes about the kind of people I love to hate.  Shallow and superficial, Ellis' protagonists are those glitzy, damaged, artificial souls that only emotionally fragile people find attractive; people who have no talent, no intelligence and nothing at all to be proud of yet seem to be proud of their shallowness anyway while deep down despising themselves and everything they stand for.  They're the kind of people you'd meet at Hollywood parties, at the Cannes Film Festival, in the casino at Monte Carlo.<br />Ellis, however, doesn't let these icons of superficiality and stupidity get away with their silliness.  Instead, he always reveals them for the monstrosities and curiosities they really are.  He lets us know that behind a public persona is...nothing.<br />\\"Glamorama\\" is a dark and bizarre book that does a very good job of exposing the world of superficiality and banning its denizens into the hell they should rightfully inhabit.  Sometimes it succeeds...brilliantly, yet at other times it seems to almost fall into the world of superficiality, itself.<br />The protagonist of \\"Glamorama,\\" Victor Ward, is the perfect protagonist for this story.  He's the ultimate \\"It-boy,\\" a man with no personality of his own, a man for whom clubs, fashion shows, superficiality and pretension are nothing if they are not everything.  In fact, Victor's entire world is tied to his media persona; take that away and Victor ceases to exist.<br />Victor Ward may seem quite stupid literally all of the time, but he's really not.  That's one of the reasons he's the perfect protagonist for this book.  Although he fails to have one rational thought process in the pages of \\"Glamorama,\\" Victor is actually a college graduate and someone who could have, and should have, known better.  Sure, we hate him, but that's exactly what we're supposed to do.<br />I thought the first half of \\"Glamorama\\" was dead-on perfect.  It dealt with the opening of yet another \\"trendy\\" New York club and was so satirical it nearly shined in its brilliance.  It did shine, in parts.<br />The middle of the book is where I had a slight problem with the story.  After Victor is fired from his job, he's sent to Europe to find a girl no one in his right mind would really want to see.  This, in itself, isn't bad, but the events surrounding Victor's search are just so bizarre, even for Ellis, that I thought he might have simply outdone himself and let his imagination run out of control.  There are also strong hints, beginning with Victor's voyage on the QE2, that his life is not, well, really his life.  Ellis is making a statement about the vacuity of pretension...I can accept that.  Gladly.  It is when the terrorists entered the story that I thought it was a bit over-the-top and incomprehensible.  At that point, Ellis lost me and that's the only reason I gave \\"Glamorama\\" four stars instead of five.  It's the only reason I don't think this book is an absolute masterpiece.<br />The book's ending, however, was a surprise and a very welcome one.  I think Ellis truly redeemed himself and the bizarre twists on the QE2 with his superb (and very fitting) ending.  There's a very strong and powerful message in the ending of \\"Glamorama\\" and it's one that's very thought-provoking as well.  I think perhaps the people who didn't like this book might have been missing the point.  I don't know, of course, but that would be my guess.  I think anyone who doesn't think this a powerful and satirical book should reread it with an open mind.  While it's not always enjoyable, it is absolutely brilliant in parts and it's quite a powerful commentary on the shallowness of life, albeit ultimately a very sad one.  Sad, but oh-so-true.	2002-05-23

In &quot;Silk,&quot; what is not written is far more powerful than what is and, despite this book's slim size, it contains a very complex plot.<br />The story in &quot;Silk&quot; revolves around Herve Joncour, a 19th century French silk merchant and his quest to find new silkworm eggs in faraway Japan.  On the first of many visits to Japan, Joncour encounters a beautiful woman, a woman to whom he never speaks and will never know, but with whom he falls hopelessly in love, despite his faithful wife who waits for him in France.<br />&quot;Silk&quot; is a book about the struggle of daily life, the struggle to survive, the interior struggle to do what is morally right, yet the style of the book is extraordinarily elegant, enigmatic and very, very deliberate.  The silence of &quot;Silk&quot; simply &quot;is.&quot;  We are never privy to Joncour's desire for the woman in Japan, a woman with a curious Western face, but we know it's there.  In the same vein, Baricco never tells us of Joncour's wife's knowledge of her husband's longing, his secret desires, his feeling for the woman in Japan as well as his feelings for her.  I think mature readers will derive the most from &quot;Silk&quot; for this is a book that is highly individualized; much depends greatly on a reader's intuitive understanding of human nature and all its nuances and the more life experience a reader has, the more he or she will understand what Joncour and his wife understand.<br />What is really amazing is how much plot Baricco manages to pack into this beautiful, quiet, slim, little book.  We learn about 19th century travel with all its pleasures and its perils; we learn about the dependence of a small French village on a small Japanese one; we learn about the secret longings of the heart that can never be fulfilled; and we learn about the communication that can exist between a manand wife, a communication born of many years of marriage and one that needs no words.<br />The two storylines, the one of Joncour as he travels to Japan and the one of Joncour who lives in blissful domesticity with his wife, Helene, eventually meet in an enigmatic letter written entirely in Japanese.  Joncour, of course, cannot read it, and he thinks it looks &quot;like a catalogue of the footprints of little birds, fantastically meticulous in its compilation.&quot;  This letter, which proves to be a tiny masterpiece, is the key to the enigma of Joncour, Helene, and the mysterious woman in Japan.<br />When we finally realize what has been going on, when the mystery of the letter is finally solved and both we and Joncour know what it says and who sent it, we have to ask ourselves:  Whose love was greater, Joncour's or Helene's?<br />&quot;Silk&quot; is a beautiful book, one of the most beautiful I have ever read, but it is also heartbreaking.  Still, this story is worth every tear that we may shed over its telling and, in the end, we must ask ourselves if love is worth the voluptuous pleasure we attach to it or is it simply, in the end, something that will break our heart time and time again.	2002-05-22

The trouble is, Ryder can't remember traveling to this city or even agreeing to play there.<br />It's clear that the city's inhabitants feel their future is riding on Ryder's performance.  This city is a city beset with problems of one sort and another, but its citizens all seem to feel that these problems can be solved through aesthetic (here, take &quot;aesthetic&quot; to mean &quot;music&quot;) progression and appreciation and they are depending on Ryder to fill the void.  This turns Ryder from a confused and dazed musician into a something of a cultural messiah.  Or does it?  Can aesthetic appreciation solve a plethora of woes or does it simply lead to woes of another kind instead?<br />The main story problem in &quot;The Unconsoled&quot; is the town's desire for Ryder to rescue them from their lack of artistic development.  Although this may seem difficult to accept as a story premise, in the hands of a writer as skilled and as experienced as Ishiguro, it is very believable indeed.  Part of what makes it so believable is that it is presented as something that is very concrete while the rest of the book is quite dreamlike and surreal.<br />While in this strange city, Ryder encounters both friends and strangers who just happen to know many of the intimate details of his life.  Ryder himself, gains the ability to know and to understand things that he couldn't possible know and understand...under normal circumstance.  Even the very landscape itself, becomes a dreamscape, with cafes connecting to hotels through dreamlike tunnels.  What is real?  What isn't?  And where is the line that separates the two?  Is there one?<br />&quot;The Unconsoled&quot; is a book that will raise far more questions than it will ever answer...at least in one reading.  I think too much analysis ruins its effect; it's best to simply accept &quot;The Unconsoled&quot; for what it is...and for what it isn't.<br />Ishiguro's writing, always perfect, is very stylized in this book and, although the book is quite long, it moves along very quickly.  Are we inconsolably lost in a dream or in a nightmare?  And what, if anything, will ever rescue us?  That, to me, seems to be what Ishiguro is asking in this book.  But, as to answers, well, this talented author isn't giving us any.  At least not any that are clear-cut, for no clear-cut answers exist, either for Ryder, the citizens of this unnamed city, or us.	2002-05-22

Part of the reason it is my favorite is the fact that it takes place in Ireland and in Venice...two of my favorite places in the world.  And Ireland and Venice are perfect locales for this story with its distinctly fairy tale quality.  There is magic in \\"As It Is In Heaven\\" and it is definitely Irish magic.<br />The characters in this book are all emotionally and spiritually damaged, but then who isn't?  Still, Philip, Stephen and Gabriella seem to be a little more damaged and vulnerable to pain than are most and they really come to life in this book.  Williams does a superb job of baring their souls and letting us share in their emotions.  <br />Philip Griffin is a man who blames himself for the death of his wife and young daughter many years ago (although he is blameless).  Stephen, his son, now thirty-two, was raised and loved by his father, but it is clear that the loss of his mother has affected him deeply.  He is a man who knows \\"the fine skills of walking in empty rooms and being aware of the ghosts.\\"  Although the story isn't predictable, its theme is clear:  this is a story about the redemptive power of love, the power of love to heal, to make whole.<br />Stephen feels his life begin to heal when he meets the beautiful Venetian violinist, Gabriella Castoldi.  Gabriella is a women who is fighting ghosts of her own.  An \\"expectancy of grief\\" hovers over her at all times; it is so powerful it even affects those with whom she interacts.<br />This is a story that could so easily have fallen into the very maudlin.  And sometimes Williams does give in to the temptation to write a little over-the-top.  Love doesn't heal all wounds; it's no magic panacea of beauty and poetry and it can sometimes cause more problems than it solves.  This is something Williams seems to want to forget.<br />Williams rescues (and balances) his story, however, with insight into the human soul that is heartbreakingly accurate, achingly perceptive and beautifully wise.  And, sometimes these insights come from unexpected sources, making them all the more believable and welcome.<br />The fey, fairy tale quality of this book will no doubt draw some readers in while causing others to discard it as \\"too romantic.\\"  I think I fall somewhere in between.  Love doesn't solve all problems, love can't endure against all odds, yet love is the force that drives the universe and gives meaning to our lives.  I found I was able to forgive Williams' ventures into the overly-lyrical and enjoy \\"As It Is In Heaven\\" for the beautiful love story it is.<br />Williams' prose is very lyrical, very poetic and very romantic, but this book is still exceptionally well-written.  And sometimes, a very romantic story is just what I'm looking for.  Although I don't believe love can conquer all, I certainly believe in its healing and redemptive powers.<br />I don't think there's an author alive who writes of the pain and beauty of love with quite the magic of Niall Williams.  If you're in the mood for an old-fashioned love story, one that will make you laugh and cry and sigh, then you really can't do better than \\"As It Is In Heaven.\\"  Leave reality behind when you enter this magic world; just savor the book and let it become a part of you.	2002-05-21

She should be congratulated for having the courage to tackle very difficult subject matter as she did in \\"The Dark Room,\\" i.e., telling the story of the Holocaust, not through the eyes of its surviving victims, but through the eyes of the murderers instead.<br />Although the protagonists (there are three) in Seiffert's book aren't actually murderers per se, they have become murderers by association; their implicit acceptance of Nazi Germany's crimes against the Jews has condemned them.  There is Helmut, who is a Berlin teenager at the start of the war; Lore, a young girl who becomes yet another displaced person at the war's end; and Micha, perhaps the most interesting character, who is actually a member of the next generation.  Micha is only thirty years old in 1997 when he begins to question his own ancestry and the history of his family.<br />I like the way Seiffert tells the stories of her three protagonists.  Her prose is terse, quite muted and written entirely in the present tense.  We are given only information the protagonists themselves know and understand and they come to know and understand themselves and their situations very slowly and very deliberately.<br />It is fitting that none of the characters in the three stories that make up \\"The Dark Room\\" fully understands the situation that surrounds him or her.  Helmut, the protagonist of the first story, becomes a photographer's assistant when a birth defect keeps him out of the army.  In his photographs of Berlin he notices that people keep disappearing, but it is quite some time before he understands why.<br />The book's second protagonist, Lore, may be the character least likely to comprehend the horrific events going on around her.  She is only a teenage girl, yet she must take care of her siblings on a journey from Bavaria to Hamburg.  It takes both Lore and the reader time before they understand why Lore must get rid of \\"the badges\\" and just exactly what those badges really are.  Lore's story is a story filled with deception and ambiguity and we really don't comprehend all of the deception until the story's end.<br />Micha's story is the most tangled, perhaps because he is the protagonist furthest removed from the happenings during the war.  Micha is a young German school teacher who is struggling to come to terms with his ancestry and his school's activities commemorating the Holocaust.<br />All three of the stories that make up \\"The Dark Room\\" represent a different, but very good look at the Holocaust and help us to understand the feelings of those involved, albeit indirectly.  Germany is indeed a \\"dark room,\\" but it is a room in which the truth must eventually come to light.	2002-05-21
US	38577070	R1TJPZWN9Y85I6	0743410513	605962018	The Unburied	Books	4	5	5	N	N	But What About the Ghost	I usually can't stand mysteries but Charles Palliser's \\"The Quincunx\\" seemed too good to pass up...and it was.  So, I was really eager to read \\"The Unburied,\\" even though it took me some time to get around to doing just that.  I found that \\"The Unburied\\" is a very different mystery than is \\"The Quincunx.\\"  While \\"The Quincunx\\" was filled with fast-paced adventure and intrigue, \\"The Unburied\\" is definitely a 19th century \\"drawing room\\" mystery.  A lot of this book even takes place in the drawing room...in front of massive fireplaces, during tea, etc.  It is a setting that fits the novel and the story told perfectly.<br />The trouble with \\"The Unburied,\\" for me at least, is that it can't seem to decide exactly what it is.  At first, it seems to be a very Gothic ghost story.  Dr. Edward Courtine is an academician who travels to the British town of Thurchester to visit an old friend.  In an overly-long opening exposition (one in which I nearly discarded the book), Courtine learns of a 200 year old murder and of a ghost that is said to still haunt Thurchester.  Okay, I thought, good.  I like ghost stories, as long as they're told with skill and panache.<br />Courtine however, wasn't as interested in the ghost (or in the fact that the people of Thurchester were acting in a very odd manner) as he was in tracking down a lost book on Alfred the Great.  At this point, I felt my interest begin to sag a bit, but still, I thought, perhaps the lost book had something to do with the ghost.  Palliser is a clever writer and I thought he would certainly tie the two together...eventually.<br />\\"The Unburied\\" is a book with more red herrings and false clues, more twists and turns than an Alpine mountain pass and this isn't always good.  Not only do we have the 200 year old murder to think about, Palliser gives us a fresh murder to entice and confuse us.  Is \\"The Unburied\\" about the 200 year old murder and the ghost that is said to haunt Thurchester or is it about this recent murder?  The answer is really both and neither.  If that makes no sense to you, you'll just have to read the book to find out why.<br />I liked \\"The Unburied\\" overall, but I think Palliser made it a little too ponderous, a little too difficult.  There's a little too much \\"telling\\" in this book and not quite enough \\"showing.\\"  And I think it was a bit overly-long.  Even 19th century readers got tired of so much expository material.<br />If Palliser wanted to write a book that returned the reader to the 19th century English \\"drawing room\\" mystery, he certainly succeeded.  This a book that is very Victorian in flavor and in pace.  I really didn't mind this slow pace...I like atmosphere and \\"The Unburied\\" simply abounds with rolling fog, gaslights and things that go bump in the night.  What I didn't like was the fact that Palliser left so many questions unanswered and led us down so many false trails that we began to lose sight of the real one.<br />If you're a reader who loves a good mystery, who loves a mystery in which it's impossible to figure everything out, and if you have the patience to wade through many red herrings and false starts, then \\"The Unburied\\" might be perfect for you.  But if you need something a little faster-paced and if you need all the questions answered at the book's end, it might be best to pass on this one even though it is very well-written.<br />I know several people have compared Palliser with Umberto Eco.  This is unfair to both authors, I think, as both are very original in style and content.  And really, Palliser is nothing at all like Eco!  Eco is far more cerebral than is Palliser.  Palliser, whose writing is just as good, writes more for the \\"everyday\\" reader than does Eco.<br />Overall, I liked \\"The Unburied,\\" but I did get impatient with Palliser (and with Courtine) at times, and I did want to know about that ghost!	2002-05-21
US	38577070	R1APU35SZ7W02E	0399148027	453088490	Blue Diary	Books	2	27	30	N	N	It Could Have Been a Heart	\\"Blue Diary\\" is Alice Hoffman's fourteenth novel, so one would think she would know better than to create such cliched and cardboard-cutout characters as the ones that people this story.  I love Hoffman's lyrical, and sometimes hyperbolic prose however, so I decided to give \\"Blue Diary\\" a chance.<br />The plot of this book is not bad, but it's nothing to email your friends about, either.  After thirteen years of marriage, and the birth of a son, an unsuspecting, but perfect wife, Jorie Ford, is shocked when her perfect husband, Ethan is arrested for the long-ago rape and murder of a teenaged girl.  Even more shocking to Jorie is the fact that \\"Ethan\\" is not really \\"Ethan.\\"  He is Byron Bell, a sociopathic murderer.<br />Although I found the plot of \\"Blue Diary\\" rather trite, it was the characters that really made me dislike the book.  Jorie is simply \\"too perfect.\\"  She is the perfect homemaker, the perfect mother, the perfect gardener.  And even all this sweet perfection and outward domestic bliss would have been acceptable if Hoffman had not made Jorie so maddeningly clueless.<br />Come on!  How many wives would be so naive as to not even wonder when their longtime husband had never once revealed even a hint of his life before marriage?  Husbands who didn't reveal where they were born, who their families and friends were, where they went to school, etc.?  I can tell you one wife who wouldn't bat a perfectly mascared eyelash at all this secrecy...Jorie Ford.  It was maddening.  I wanted to slap the woman to wake her up from her dreamworld.  I have a feeling a slap wouldn't have helped, though.  Jorie Ford is a woman who sees the world and everyone in it in terms of black and white.  There are the \\"good guys\\" and there are the \\"bad guys.\\"  And  clearly, she and Ethan have been the \\"very good guys.\\"<br />Even more irritating is that fact that Hoffman attempts to couch her treacle in \\"small-town\\" warmth and fuzziness.  Her omnisicent narrator moves here and there in ahaze of clueless wonder that is second only to Jorie's.  There is suspense in this storyline, make no mistake about that, the plot is not the problem here, it is the characters, Jorie, in particular.<br />If Hoffman had written a book in which a character such as Jorie wanted to explore her need for domestic perfection, then this might have actually worked.  But even after (finally) realizing she's married a murderer and a liar, Jorie Ford, aka Jorie Bell, feels no such need.  She simply accepts the fact that she's perfect and a bad man did a bad thing...to her.  She's the wronged victim who takes absolutely no personal responsibility for her lack of perception.  It wasn't her fault her husband was so bad, she thinks.  It wasn't her fault he was so good at hiding his past from her.  Sure.  We hear you, Jorie.<br />The final blow comes when Hoffman, steeped in sentimentality, gives the dead teenager a birthmark at the base of her spine in the shape of a butterfly.  I suppose it could have been worse.  It could have been shaped like a heart.<br />Alice Hoffman usually writes more fanciful books and I think she's at her best in that realm.  Her prose, even in this dreadful book, is lyrical and poetic and wonderful to read.  Pretty prose, however, needs a little something more to back it up.  If not a plot, then an original literary device, if not an original literary device, then a fascinating character, etc.  Sadly, \\"Blue Diary\\" doesn't have any of these things.  It's just treacle.	2002-05-18
US	38577070	R308N8UF8DV8FI	0375725059	408763793	The PowerBook	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Scheherazade for the 21st Century	If you're someone who loves the power of words, who loves lush, poetic prose and the images it can conjure, the magic it can work, then you will probably love Jeanette Winterson's beautiful novel, \\"The Powerbook.\\"<br />\\"The Powerbook\\" explores Winterson's recurring themes of time, love and gender identificantion (or the lack of it) through the story of Ali/Alix, a woman living in cyberworld and reinventing herself at another's command.  But reinventing yourself doesn't come without a price as Ali/Alix soon finds out.  Will she pay it?  And if she does, will it be worth the price? <br />For me, \\"The Powerbook\\" is Jeanette Winterson at her very best.  Everything that was so wonderful in her previous novels comes together in this one.  She tells stories, she writes the most lyrically divine prose, she uses linear time and circular time, she anchors herself in reality while letting herself soar on flights of fancy.<br />\\"The Powerbook\\" is art for the sake of art.  Although some would argue that \\"art for the sake of art,\\" especially in the literary realm, is nothing but conceit, Winterson herself, has stated differently and I agree with her.  Art, she said, is our opportunity to get things right.  To tell the truth.  To find the ultimate reality.  And she's right.  Art doesn't deceive us, except on very rare occasions, and when those rare occasions do occur, we're angry with the artist.<br />I know that many people will read this book and wail, \\"But that's not real life!\\"  Those who do should stop and reread the book once again.  And even again and again if need be.  It's life that tells us lies, either deliberately or by omission, life that deceives, life that denies us the rich world of fantasy and imagination and creative invention...the world that Winterson seeks and finds in her own strikingly original work.<br />In \\"The Powerbook,\\" Winterson allows her narrator to become a part of his/her own stories, to become a character in them, to reinvent himself/herself to suit the needs of the receiver.  While this book is not conventionally plotted, there are stories in \\"The Powerbook,\\" and they are wonderful stories indeed.  One of the best is a meandering, poetic discourse on the meaning of life and love and death.  \\"I was happy with the lightness of being in a foreign city,\\" Winterson writes, evoking Milan Kundera's wonderful \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being,\\" \\"and the relief from identity that it brings.\\"  And later,  \\"There was such lightness in me that I had to be tied to the pommel of the saddle...\\"<br />\\"The Powerbook\\" is set in London and Paris and on the beautiful island of Capri as well as in the world of cyberspace, employing both the world of reality and the world of fantasy in the very best mix possible.  The lines between reality and fantasy begin to blur in this book, but they blur in real life as well.  Who can say exactly how much of an experience is \\"real\\" and exactly how much exists in the imagination?<br />And, as she does in every book, Winterson mesmerizes us with her images of time, or the lack of time.  She explores linear time, circular time, the absence of time, the impermeability of time, the transmutation of time, time without end and on and on and on.  It's  fascinating, but only if you want to make the effort. <br />Winterson is so often accused of being possesed of literary conceit and disdain for her readers.  I think this is grossly unfair criticism.  Her books can be difficult and they do demand the reader's attention; one cannot flip through a Jeanette Winterson book, speed-reading on a beach under the summer sun.  However, if Winterson demands attention and time and effort from her readers she also gives.  I judge a book's worth, in part, by what I take with me after reading it, what becomes lasting, what changes me.  With Winterson's books I am always a different person when I finish than when I began...I'm richer, smarter, more enlightened.  To me, that's high praise for an author rather than criticism.<br />In Winterson's wonderful book, \\"The Passion,\\" she writes, \\"I'm telling you stories.  Believe me.\\"  It is the wise reader who does believe Winterson and the rewarded one who listens to her stories...again and again and again.  Jeanette Winterson really is a writer with something important to say.	2002-05-18
US	38577070	R2DCH2LANF5PLT	0345439104	903040762	Drowning Ruth: A Novel (Oprah's Book Club)	Books	2	12	14	N	N	It Really Fizzled	Christina Schwartz writes a very clear, evocative prose that keeps the reader oriented at all times, despite her jumps back and forth in time.  And three of her characters, Amanda, Ruth, and Mattie, seem fully-realized and well-developed.  She begins her story quite well, with a mystery to be solved, and there is a touch of the Gothic about her writing that only serves to intrigue.  The problem is, the story really doesn't go anywhere.  Schwartz never takes us to any of those fascinating mysteries we hope to have solved.  Instead, her story gradually loses steam as it moves along until it finally fizzles into a very predictable and ho-hum ending.<br />\\"Drowning Ruth\\" opens at the end of World War I and takes place in rural Wisconsin where Amanda Starkey, over-stressed from her duties as a nurse, retreats to her younger sister's farm for rest and recuperation.  Mattie (the younger sister) is alone at the farm with her young daughter, Ruth, since her husband, Carl, has yet to return from the war.  Mattie is by far the prettier and more outgoing sister, although Amanda may be the more practical.  In any case, the sisters do love each other and both care deeply for Ruth.<br />Right from the beginning, Schwartz makes it clear that Amanda's sanity is in question.  We don't doubt this for a second, yet Amanda's narrative is one we feel we can trust, no doubt because Amanda, herself, is aware of her own shortcomings regarding her emotional stability.  One would think this would make Amanda a fascinating character but it doesn't.  She is simply too rigid in her outlook and too given to secrecy to let us really get to know her.<br />Amanda's narrative is broken by narrative from Ruth, who is quite annoying with her own particular brand of baby talk.  I was glad her passages were relatively short as they really grated on my nerves.  Running through Amanda's and Ruth's first-person narrative is an omniscient, third-person narrative, far better than Ruth, but not nearly as goodas Amanda could have been.<br />From the very beginning of the book we know that the central mystery entails what really happened when Mattie slipped through the ice and drowned in the family's pond one cold, winter night.  Here Schwartz leads her readers on a merry chase only to let them down terribly at the book's end, for what happened that night is exactly what we think happened on page one.  There's no mystery.  All that Gothic buildup was for nothing unless Schwartz simply likes to see her readers land with a resounding \\"thud.\\"<br />There's very little plot in \\"Drowning Ruth\\" and that would be okay if Schwartz hadn't led us to believe otherwise.  Had she let us know she was going to write a story that concentrated on the relationships among the characters, we wouldn't have been expecting something she failed to deliver.  <br />Even Schwartz, herself, doesn't seem to know exactly what she wants to write about.  If she wants to write about the night Mattie died, she needed to give us more plot and not make the end so predictable and boring.  If she wanted to concentrate on the relationships among the characters, then she needed to flesh out the characters of Carl (Mattie's husband), and Imogene more.  Much more.  And she needed to let us get to know them.  Really know them.  And what about poor Clement Owens?  His storyline could simply be discarded without making a bit of difference in the book.<br />Schwartz is very good at evoking rural Wisconsin life.  Her descriptions of Amanda cutting brilliant red stalks of rhubarb for a pie outshine anything that goes on among her characters.  It is in describing the day-to-day happenings of country life that Schwartz really shines and at those times her prose becomes almost brilliant.<br />Ultimately, however, Schwartz has to write herself out of the plot corner she's created and unfortunately, she resorts to dreaded coincidence to do so.  Several characters prove to be no more than stage dressing and are summarily dispatched for no other reason than Schwartz's convenience.  This might have been forgivable had the ending contained something worth waiting for, but sadly, it didn't.<br />If Christina Schwartz chooses to write another book, I doubt that I will read it, but I do hope she polishes her own budding talent and decides to discard the cheap tricks and glitzy gimmicks.  No story worth the telling needs them.	2002-05-12
US	38577070	RYCY5N2UZOBTI	0060932589	899090623	Mondo Desperado: A Serial Novel	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Truth Masquerading as Absurdity	I love Patrick McCabe's books.  I really thought \\"The Butcher Boy,\\" \\"Breakfast on Pluto,\\" and \\"The Dead School\\" were exceptional so I knew I would love \\"Mondo Desperado\\" as well and I was right.  This collection of stories is as wacky as they come (maybe even as wacky as \\"Breakfast on Pluto\\") but they are terrific and McCabe's alter ego, Phildy Hackball, is a character you won't soon forget.<br />Even Pat Cork's opening \\"Appreciation\\" of Phildy's decision to cast the citizens of Barntrosna as characters in a low-budget, B-movie (reminiscent of those the boys used to sneak out of school to see) is hilarious.  And the citizens of Barntrosna don't let Phildy down.  Time and again, they prove themselves more than worthy of any B-moviemaker's attention.<br />There is nothing quite as shocking in \\"Mondo Desperado\\" as the heinous crimes that took place in McCabe's masterpiece, \\"The Butcher Boy\\" and the citizens of Barntrosna aren't quite as off-the-wall hysterical as Patrick Braden, star of \\"Breakfast on Pluto,\\" but \\"Mondo Desperado\\" does prove time and time again just how desperate the world really is.<br />There is the priest who believes he has ordained Satan himself, the Barntrosna girl who finds lesbian love in London and most of all, there is Larry Bunyan, the protagonist of \\"Hot Nights at the Go-Go Lounge.\\"  Larry, for reasons both he and I don't quite understand, believes his rather frumpy wife, Cora, is having more than one affair behind his back.  Larry is overcome with disbelief, but still, he says, he really has to hand it to Cora, for who would have believed it.<br />What McCabe's characters share in common, and the thread that ties these stories together, is the pathetic quality of their ludicrous plights.  Plights they have, for the most part, created themselves.  We don't want to be like them, but we can't help but see little bits and pieces of ourselves in them and it makes us laugh or cry...depending on good a sense of humor one has.<br />I don't think \\"Mondo Desperado\\" is quite Patrick McCabe at his finest.  I think you need \\"The Butcher Boy\\" or \\"Breakfast on Pluto\\" for that, but \\"Mondo Desperado\\" comes very close.  It's satiric, it's wacky, it's ludicrous, it's truth masquerading as absurdity.  If you haven't yet read Patrick McCabe, \\"Mondo Desperado\\" might be a great place to start.	2002-05-12

But become a monk he does, and he is renamed Brother Antoine.  Although Paul is now an official member of the monastery, several years must pass before he will be allowed to take his final vows.  It is on these difficult years that the book concentrates.<br />Brother Antoine quickly learns that life in the monastery isn't all the spiritual paradise he expected it to be.  Monasteries, he sees, have cliques and politics of their own and, against his will, Brother Antoine becomes caught up in them.<br />Cliques and politics aren't the only problems that besiege Brother Antoine at this crucial time in his life, either.  He soon finds both his identity and his faith...two areas of his life in which he formerly felt secure...become areas of grave doubt.  With few exceptions, the monks surrounding Brother Antoine are of little or no help to him...in fact, they may be harming him instead.  Among their number are pack rats, pyromaniacs, smokers, gossips, drunks and worse.  Brother Antoine eventually decides that most of the monastery is populated by frauds and fools.  When he reacts to this lack of asceticism among his brothers with a seemingly conceited veneer of \\"holiness,\\" he is quickly unmasked for who he really is, and not without comic results.<br />Although there is comedy in this book, it is a quiet comedy and completely lacking in sentimentality...all to the good.  Rougeau resists the temptation to contrast Brother Antoine's \\"goodness\\" with the quirks and foibles of what could be considered \\"lesser\\" monks.In the same vein, he resists the urge to make his saints (and the monastery does contain a few of them) \\"too good.\\"  Ultimately, there are only human beings in this book, whether saint or sinner or somewhere inbetween, and that is what causes the book to stand apart from others like it.<br />Of course, Brother Antoine is not the man Paul Seneschal envisioned when he entered the monastery, but perhaps he is someone even better.  If he is, then, once again, we're not sure why; he experiences no grand epiphany, no religious awakening, but then, how many human beings do?  Brother Antoine's goodness, and even what he possesses of saintliness, take him by surprise, for they were born of the more mundane, ordinary things of life and are not at all what he had anticipated.<br />Readers who need a lot of suspense in their books and a clear problem for the protagonist to solve probably won't like this book.  Rather than structuring his story around a more conventional plot, Rougeau has written it so that it has a very episodic quality about it.  Everything is linked, yes, but there's no real buildup, climax and denouement.  This didn't bother me; I like quiet, contemplative books that deal with the inner life, but those who don't should look elsewhere.<br />Those who like to get inside a character's mind and heart, to really know him and empathize with his inner struggles, however, will no doubt find \\"All We Know of Heaven\\" to be a beautiful and contemplative book, just as I did.	2002-05-02

All of them, including Gustav Klimt, the most important painter of fin-de-siecle Europe, loved her to distraction and swore that a part, at least, of his most profound and greatest work was inspired, both by her and by his passion for her.<br />Alma, while being quite successful as a muse, was less successful as a mistress and a wife, and she was certainly no \\"good girl.\\"  She sometimes had more than one lover at a time and felt no shame in the situation.  Instead, she called herself \\"a collector of geniuses.\\"  She was, by turns, a seductress, a flirt, a romantic and a real delight.  She was also dreadfully anti-Semitic despite the fact that she had, not one, but two, Jewish husbands, Mahler and Werfel.<br />This book is called \\"fiction\\" but it is really based on Alma's own memoirs.  Phillips writes the story from Alma's point of view, however, from beyond the grave, and he tosses in carefully chosen bits of imagined conversation, etc., causing the book to be classified as \\"fiction\\" rather than \\"fact.\\"<br />Alma is not a character we can admire, but she is certainly interesting.  She is a restless spirit in death and in life she was often selfish and downright mean.  More than anything, she is vain, but she is not vain about everything.  She does realize that she, too, has her faults.  As she says about her voice, \\"I screeched all the Wagner roles until I ruined a good mezzo-soprano voice.\\"  And, as she once wrote in her diary, \\"I'm utterly vulgar, superficial, sybaritic, domineering and egoistic!\\"<br />If Alma was hard on herself, she was even harder on her husbands and lovers and even her potential lovers.  She was a notorious flirt who often brought men to their knees only to spurn them in the most ungracious manner.  One sometimes wonders why she bothered marrying at all; her opinion of the men in her life seems so very low.  Gropius, who seems like an Adonis to Alma at first, sours as well, leaving Alma bored and lonely at only thirty-two and ready for an encounter with the wild, possessive and jealous painter, Oskar Kokoschka, who is six years her junior.  Kokoschka, in the end, loses out to Gropius who, despite his boring qualities is more of a genius than is Kokoschka.  Kokoschka doesn't take his humiliation at all well and what he does is pitiful, a little shocking and even a little funny.  And, to be sure, the humor of the situation isn't lost on Alma. <br />Sadly, in some ways, Alma Schlinder, whose life so depended on her good looks and her vibrant wit, oulived almost everyone around her and lost both her looks and her wit at about the same time.  <br />Although some readers have complained about the rather staccato prose in this book, it is prose that fits exactly the way Alma wrote in her own memoirs, so I think it is very fitting that Phillips adopted this style.  And while some readers will no doubt see Alma as simply vain and mean-spirited, she was fascinating...there can be no doubt about that.  I think Phillips has done a marvelous job in capturing the qualities and the vibrancy of Alma that made her so irresistible to so many men, despite the fact that she never really respected them, and perhaps, never really loved them.<br />I loved this book.  I thought it was interesting, well-written and vivacious...just as vivacious as was Alma Schindler in her youth.  And that is really saying a lot.	2002-04-29
US	38577070	RU5L795M3HYXM	0060188731	546555129	Bel Canto: A Novel	Books	4	7	7	N	N	The Power of Music	&quot;Bel Canto&quot; is a beautiful book and one that I enjoyed very much.  <br />It is clear that Patchett took inspiration for this novel from a real life incident--the taking of the Japanese Embassy by Tupac Amaru guerrillas in Lima, Peru in 1996.  Patchett does not even use the word &quot;Peru,&quot; in her novel, but the fact that the book was inspired by this incident simply can't be missed.  (She speaks of a fog that envelopes the city as &quot;more than mist and less than drizzle.&quot;  This is clearly Lima during the winter.)  The fact that this is not a factual work, however, does nothing to negate the book's wonderful qualities...in fact, I think it adds to them.<br />As the book opens, a birthday party has been arranged for a Japanese electronics tycoon.  In order to make the party all the more enticing, he has been told that his favorite soprano will be on hand to sing for him.  <br />There is trouble brewing, however.  A group of guerrillas has decided to use the birthday party as an opportunity to kidnap the president.  The president, however, has other plans and the guerrillas end up taking the most important party guests as their hostages instead.<br />The important thing in &quot;Bel Canto&quot; isn't whether or not the hostages escape to freedom.  Instead, it is the far more interesting and complex psychological interactions among the guerrillas and the hostages and among the hostages themselves.  Perceptions change; complex love relationships develop; surprises of all kind are in store.  Of course, the soprano takes center stage in this book as she well deserves.  She's a wonderful character.  Much to Patchett's credit, she makes these psychological complexities completely believable.<br />&quot;Bel Canto&quot; is Italian for &quot;beautiful singing,&quot; and this book is about beautiful singing and the power of music but it is also about so much more.  It is about the power of love as well as the negative influence of political and economic upheaval.  The characters are fully-realized and quite believable even if the plot does slip into melodrama in a few spots.  Some readers might even enjoy the bits of melodrama and, for them, the book would suffer with their absence.<br />&quot;Bel Canto,&quot; while taken from a factual incident, is fiction.  It is, however, beautiful fiction and a book I think most readers will thoroughly enjoy.	2002-04-28

Together with Thomas' brother, Rich and his seductive lover, Adaline, Jean sails to Smuttynose and attempts to piece together the facts of the crime.  As Jean delves deeper and deeper into what could have really happened, her own personal life takes a nosedive.<br />Jean begins to suspect her own husband of having an affair and she thus become prey to the very negative emotions of jealousy and mistrust...emotions that will eventually have far-reaching and devastating effects on her life and on the lives of those around her.<br />The Smuttynose murders are historical fact, Shreve did not make them up.  On March 5, 1873, Norwegian immigrants Karen Christensen and her sister-in-law Anethe were brutally murdered with an ax in the home of their sister, Maren and her husband.  Although Maren was a witness to the murders, she somehow escaped becoming a victim.  And, even though Maren did name the murderer and he was tried and hanged, speculation still abounds.  Did Maren name the actual murderer?  Was she protecting someone else instead?  And if she was, why?<br />In \\"The Weight of Water,\\" Shreve (who previously wrote a short story about the murders), seemlessly weaves the historical story of Maren with the fictional one of Jean.  The result is a wonderfully engrossing book about what happens when a woman is pushed to the extremes of emotion...extremes she may not be able to handle.<br />This is a very atmospheric book.  Shreve has done a masterful job in recreating the New England shore and she uses it to great advantage.  The book also has a very claustrophobic feel to it.  Much of it takes place on board Rich's sailboat where the four principals, caught up together in rather small confines, begin to experience tensions that simmer so much we know they're going to have to erupt.  They only question is:  What will happen when they do?<br />Both of the stories are interesting and engrossing.  Maren's story of the past can't help but hold our attention; it is, after all, a real life mystery and one that many believe has never been properly solved.  Although this book doesn't really contribute to the historical debate about the murders, it does whet one's appetite and make him or her want to know more.<br />The fictional story of Jean is no less intriguing.  It simply seethes with emotion, emotion that lies just below the surface, strong emotion that constantly threatens the characters involved, Jean in particular.<br />I thought Shreve did a wonderful job cutting back and forth between the past and the present, between Maren's story and Jean's.  I found the pacing in \\"The Weight of Water\\" to be seamless, perfect.  The ending is shocking and yes, it is a little abrupt and very sad.  Shreve has been criticized for this ending, but I think that criticism is entirely unfair.  If you let the ending sink in a bit and come to terms with it, you will realize, that given Jean's actions and her suspicions, the book really couldn't have ended any other way and still maintained its power.<br />\\"The Weight of Water\\" is ultimately a beautiful, but harrowing book that shows us the destruction that awaits when anyone is pushed to the limit of his or her endurance.	2002-04-23
US	38577070	R2QQCLQG9WVUPE	0156005891	865843112	Eden Close	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Predictable but Sensitive	Most of Anita Shreve's books contain a mystery and most end with a dramatic twist; &quot;Eden Close&quot; is no exception.  The problem is, most readers will be able to guess the ending twist long before the last page.  This doesn't, however, negate all the fine points of this sometimes lovely, sometimes harrowing, book.<br />As the book opens, Andrew, then a teenage boy, hears shots coming from the neighboring farmhouse where a tragedy is in the making.  The book then flashes forward to Andrew as an adult and his meeting with Eden, the teenage girl who was his neighbor at the time of the tragedy.  Gradually, piece by little piece, we learn the details of what took place that night and the (sometimes) surprising facts of the tragedy itself.<br />Eden and Andrew were close friends as teenagers; Eden was even made an &quot;honorary boy&quot; by Andrew and his friends.  This was good for the adopted Eden, for, while she was adored by her father, her mother saw her as little more than an intrusion.  As they grew, however, Andrew and Eden naturally drifted apart and Andrew eventually lost all contact with Eden until he returned to his home town as an adult.  As Andrew and Eden rebuild their friendship and become close once again, we learn, with Andrew, the details of the tragedy that befell Eden that night so long ago.<br />I think Shreve is especially good at description in this book.  She really catches the feel and ambiance of &quot;small town USA.&quot;  Additionally, both the present action (which takes place when Andrew and Eden are adults) and the flashback action (which takes place when Andrew and Eden are younger) take place during oppressive summer heat.  Shreve seems to have used this heat to link the two sections and achieve a common bond between them.  If that is truly what she has done, it works and it works well.<br />The characters in &quot;Eden Close&quot; are fully drawn and very believable.  They act in ways keeping with the personalities Shreve has given them, even when they are confronted with the most disturbing elements of the book.  I think Sherve did a particularly good job at bringing Andrew to life; his guilt over his past was easy to feel, as was his need to rehabilitate himself psychologically.<br />It is very easy to become emotionally involved with these characters and their plight.  And, unlike &quot;The Last Time They Met,&quot; Shreve does reward us for our caring.  But &quot;Eden Close&quot; is far from a sentimental book with a &quot;feel good&quot; ending.  In fact, there may be a touch too much melodrama in this book, but just a touch.  Overall, the story tension is balanced and it certainly holds our interest despite its rather predictable end.<br />&quot;Eden Close&quot; is definitely not Shreve's best work.  I think you need to read &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; for that.  But &quot;Eden Close&quot; is well-written and intriguing.  Some readers may not like Shreve's poetic use of language, but I did and I thought it fit this storyline very well.  And, despite the fact that I could guess the &quot;secret&quot; tragedy of Eden's life, that didn't stop me from enjoying this book.  It was enjoying to see how the characters dealt with the past and how it would impact their future.  Shreve is a good storyteller and she is very good at portraying ordinary people caught in extraordinary situations.<br />Although the storyline is a bit over-the-top, Shreve did handle the details with sensitivity and caring.  Despite some flaws, and despite not being Shreve at her best, I still think &quot;Eden Close&quot; is well deserving of four stars for its very good points, most particularly the beautiful use of the English language and the sensitivity with which Shreve has endowed her characters.	2002-04-22
US	38577070	RGN1RJJ9H7RKZ	0312420064	839716520	The Love-Artist: A Novel	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Wish It Were All True	I loved David Malouf's, \\"An Imaginary Life\\" so I was sure I would love \\"The Love Artist\\" as well.  I was not wrong; I do.  While \\"An Imaginary Life\\" tells the story of the Roman poet Ovid's life after his exile, \\"The Love Artist\\" tells us about what led up to that exile.  These details are all imagined, of course, but this book is so well-written and so enjoyable, one can't help but wish it were all true.<br />\\"The Love Artist\\" is told in a frame.  It opens with Ovid's arrest and exile, then flashes back to tell the story of the events leading up to that arrest and exile, until the Epilogue, set, once again, at the time of his arrest.<br />At the time of his arrest, Ovid is Rome's most fashionable and famous poet and he has just finished Metamorphoses.  Knowing he'd better leave Rome for awhile, he vacations on the east coast of the Black Sea, close to the home of Medea.  While on holiday, he meets a beautiful young herbalist, Xenia, a woman with mysterious powers who will change the course of his life when she makes him her lover and he makes her his muse.  Xenia and Ovid have the same wish in life, \\"To be known.  To be remembered.  To live forever.\\"<br />Ovid and Xenia return to Rome where it seems as though everyone except Augustus is quite pleased with Metamprphoses.  Even Augustus's hated granddaughter, Julia, is entranced by it.  Ovid, under the patronage of Julia, begins a new work, the now lost play, Medea.<br />The above sets up many questions that have to be answered in the pages of this book.  What happens when Xenia, now pregnant, discovers that the beautiful Julia is Ovid's new patron?  Will Xenia commit the same heinous crime as did Medea?  Will Ovid and Xenia find eternal life?  What will be Xenia's ultimate fate and the fate of her children?  You have to read the book to find out the answers.<br />What we do know about Ovid is scant.  We know that he was \\"probably\\" exiled because of Augustus's displeasure with The Art of Love.  But what happened to his play, Medea?  Only two lines remain.  And why was Julia, Augustus's granddaughter exiled at the same time as was Ovid?  <br />While the characters in \\"The Love Artist\\" are fascinating to read about they aren't people anyone would care to know in real life.  They are all plotting, secretive, and very selfish and self-centered in their bid for power and immortality.  And yes, even bloodthirsty.  None of the characters knows what the others are up to and, most of the time, neither do we.  This heightens the suspense of \\"The Love Artist\\" and its eventual horror is made all the more terrible by virtue of being told in language that is lyrical in its beauty.  Although Augustus seems to be the most fair and reasonable character in the book, we can't help but be fascinated with Ovid and the entrancing (but evil) Xenia.<br />The fact that Alison could fashion a novel as rich and lush as \\"The Love Artist\\" from these tiny fragments of<BR>history is not small feat.  This is a lyrical, fascinating and dense novel revolving around the themes of corrupt love, a creativity that has destruction at its core and an unquenchable desire for immortality, a desire that will render a person capable of anything.<br />Anyone who is interested in ancient Rome or in the poetry of Ovid should love \\"The Love Artist.\\"  It is engrossing and holds one's interest from the first page to the last.  I only wish it would have been longer.  I just wanted this book to go on and on.	2002-04-21
US	38577070	R26SJE69LTEEUH	0374168253	585136619	The Haunting of L.	Books	4	6	7	N	N	The End Does Not Justify the Means	While I certainly wouldn't want to read Howard Norman's books every day of the week, I do enjoy him as a change of pace.  As anyone familiar with Norman knows, life in his world is bleak and fierce, men are meek and women are bold and mysterious happenings are simply the everyday stuff of life.  Norman's novels are stories of love, murder, madness and, strangely enough, the redemptive power of art.<br />While the characters in Norman's books are usually quite low-key (the exception being some of the female characters), his plots border on the outlandish.  No, they're not science fiction or fantasy, they're more plain illogical and downright strange.  If you can't accept something like this, then Norman's books, good as they are, simply wouldn't be for you.<br />\\"The Haunting of L\\" is no exception.  Set in Halifax and on Hudson Bay, the cold described so lyrically in the book seems to literally permeate each page of the story.<br />\\"The Haunting of L\\" takes place in 1927 and basically revolves around three characters:  the narrator, Peter Duvett, and an unhappily married couple, Kala Murie and<BR>Vienna Linn.<br />Kala is the strange one of this trio right from the start.  She is a disciple of a spiritualist who has a deep and abiding belief in \\"spirit photographs,\\" a belief he passes on to Kala.  Vienna, who is not so believing, still manages to find a way to profit from these strange and rather ghoulish \\"spirit photos.\\"<br />While we know very well why Kala and Vienna are on the northern edge of Manitoba, we aren't so sure about Peter.  He's sort of a ghost of a character himself, paling beside both Kala and Vienna.  Complications arise when Vienna must deliver an assortment of \\"very special\\" photographs to his English benefactor, Radin Heur.  Not to be beaten, Vienna \\"arranges\\" for the much needed photos.  But does the end ever justify the means?<br />Without giving away the plot, I will just say that this book, while well-written and entertaining, simply asks fartoo much of the reader.  There is a little too much authorial intrusion and it spoils what could have been so much better.  While I enjoyed reading \\"The Haunting of L,\\" I did come away from it less than satisfied and it will be awhile before I return to Howard Norman again.  Though I will return.	2002-04-20
US	38577070	R25DKGM8KGI9RJ	0316780812	279731145	Sea Glass: A Novel	Books	4	76	81	N	N	Very Good	Anita Shreve's latest book, \\"Sea Glass,\\" is a quiet novel that deals with the universal themes of life, love, loss, hope, beauty, tragedy and death.<br />\\"Sea Glass\\" begins in 1929, when Sexton Beecher, a typewriter salesman, marries bank clerk, Honora.  They decide to make their home in a rather dalipidated, but still romantic, New England beach house.  Honora is a fulltime wife and homemaker and besides the usual things all wives and homemakers do, Honora loves to take long walks on the beach and collect bits of colored glass worn smooth as silk by the waves of the sea.  Eventually, Honora meets and becomes friends with Vivian, a wealthy woman who happens to live nearby.  The world seems, at least to Honora, to be an almost perfect place.<br />When things are too good, they usually don't last and Honora learns this lesson the hard way.  The Great Depression causes problems for Sexton and Honora, but it brings Honora unexpected pleasures as well, in the form of handsome Quillen McDermott and his twelve year old friend, Francis.<br />This is a book that is told from the point of view of many of the characters involved.  In almost every case this works, and it works well.  The exceptions are Vivian and Francis.  In the early sections of the book, Vivian plays such a prominent part that we come to believe she will be an integral part of the coming storyline as well.  Instead, she seems to fade a little more with each passing scene.<br />Francis is also problematic.  His chapters are written in long sentences that let us know he is smart, but lacks the education he should have at his age.  This wouldn't be bad in and of itself.  The problem arises because the rest of the novel is so quiet and so poetic; Francis' chapters seem a little abrupt, as if they're jarring us out of a lovely reverie that we just don't want to leave.<br />Shreve is good, at least in this book, at creating convincing, believable characters and then making them come to life.  The tension and excitement that exists between Honora and McDermott is especially memorable.  <br />Although the description is good, the symbolism of the sea glass, however, is a bit heavy-handed, especially near the end.<br />This is a quiet book, with no great surprises and no great suspense.  It doesn't delve too deeply into the minds and hearts of the characters involved, but then, we don't always want something that's earthshaking.  I think most women will find more than enough to relate to in this book and Anita Shreve fans will probably love it.	2002-04-20
US	38577070	R30KN2PXMDCL8D	0743222946	337618584	At Swim, Two Boys	Books	5	16	19	N	N	Achingly Beautiful, Magnificent	I will admit that I bought this book simply because I was curious.  I'd heard it was greatly influenced by James Joyce and &quot;Ulysses.&quot;  That part is definitely true, as anyone who has ever read &quot;Ulysses&quot; will know.  However, &quot;At Swim, Two Boys,&quot; is a wonderful work in its own right:  its prose, characters and storyline are exquisite.  I wasn't expecting such a masterpiece, but I'm glad to have found one.<br />The heroes/protagonists of &quot;At Swim, Two Boys&quot; are two sixteen year olds...Jim Mack, a shy, fair boy and Doyler Doyle, who is bold and dark.  The time is 1915 and Jim and Doyler have just made a promise to each other to meet on the next Easter for the purpose of swimming out together to the distant rocks known as the Muglins.  Outwardly, their purpose is to plant the flag of Ireland on the rocks, but, on a deeper level, each boy has his own hidden agenda.<br />The two boys aren't the only pivotal characters in this book, however.  There is MacMurrough, an older man with an agenda of his own; there is Mr. Mack, Jim's father, a shopkeeper who feels much like an outsider...a man who has lost much and who feels many hidden desires.<br />The prose in &quot;At Swim, Two Boys,&quot; is Irish and it is Joycean.  Like Joyce, O'Neill can be inventive.  Consider this:  &quot;A milk van round a corner came clopping, colloping, collapaling to a stop clop.&quot;  This can be a little unnerving until you get used to it, then it really does flow.  O'Neill's tribute (if that is right word) to Joyce isn't the only &quot;strange&quot; speech in this book.  The curious slang of the Dubliners is present in full force, such as when a servant girl is &quot;giving such a slice of the ignore,&quot; or when we encounter a newsboy with &quot;the even papers.&quot;  And then, mixed in with the local dialect, there is the Latin.  This really is not troublesome, but if you absolutely can't stand dialect, best to skip this book (though skipping this magnificent book would certainly be doing yourself a disservice).<br />The characters in this book are, to me at least, quite believable and very well drawn.  We can really feel the growing confidence of the two boys and their feelings for each other.  The only character whose feelings I don't quite trust is MacMurrough.  Sometimes he's a little too much the villain and sometimes he's a little too sentimental.  Either way, he's not quite real.<br />While I liked the ending of this book, it did seem a little forced.  This is too bad, because the rest of the book seems as effortless as flying a kite on a windy spring day.  Still, there is magic in this book; it's a wonderful read and a magnificent achievement and one that no lover of good literature should miss.	2002-04-20
US	38577070	RCE5DWXP397Y6	0060927968	259357267	Love, Again	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Melancholy and Romantic	\\"Love, Again\\" is one of Doris Lessing's \\"later\\" novels and it focuses on an older protagonist caught in the snares of romantic love.  Sarah Durham is sixty-five and describes herself as not having been in love in decades.  All that changes when she, the widow of a founding member of \\"The Green Bird,\\" a successful London theatre company, decides to stage an avant-garde operatic play concerning the enigmatic Julie Vairon.  Vairon lived most of her life in an isolated French village, writing music and painting and was virtually unknown until her \\"discovery\\" in the 1970s.<br />It is Julie Vairon's tortured love life that really interests Sarah, however, even more than does her strange and eerie music.  Vairon was romantically involved with two Frenchmen, yet neither romance had a happy ending.  Vairon did, however, find love at last, or what passed for love, only to have everything end both mysteriously and tragically.<br />As Sarah and her company of actors at \\"The Green Bird\\" begin work on their rendition of the life of Julie Vairon, Julie's own eroticism seems to be working its magic on the cast.  Everyone seems to be falling in love with everyone else...and some of the romances are of the most improbable imaginable.<br />Although someone not familiar with Doris Lessing's writing may think the above premise sounds more than a little silly, let me assure you that it is not.  You won't find any lovesick fools running around in this book.  Rather than reaching the heights of ecstasy, the lovers in \\"Love, Again\\" are anguished souls who become involved in relationships that don't have even a ghost of a chance of working.  And Lessing, a superlative writer, makes us feel the grief and sense of loss experienced by her characters.  We don't laugh at them; we grieve with them.<br />Stylistically, \\"Love, Again\\" is a different sort of Doris Lessing novel.  It is intricate, very internal and reflective.  It is also something of a double narrative, a literary device that I, personally, like very much.  Lessing very cleverly and skillfully lets the melancholy and tragic ghost of Julie Vairon haunts the love lives of her present-day characters.  And the life of Julie Vairon is the perfect background on which to tell the story of Sarah and company.<br />As much as this book concentrates on love, however, love is not its central theme.  The book revolves around Sarah Durham and how she copes with her own sexuality and attractiveness in light of the inevitability of growing older.  This is subject matter that Lessing has delved into before:  in \\"The Summer Before the Dark\\" Kate Brown was a woman attempting to deal with the first pangs of growing older and lost youth.  Sarah, however, is older and seemingly beyond the changes that sent Kate into a literal panic, but she does have problems of her own to deal with.<br />Sarah's problems are the most problematic area of \\"Love, Again.\\"  While I can readily accept the idea of one \\"thirtysomething\\" man falling madly in love with Sarah, the idea of three doing the very same thing is a little too much...no matter how great Sarah looks or how charming she is.  Lessing, however, is such a good writer that she can make us suspend our disbelief and buy into the proposition that three gorgeous and very sought-after men are madly pursuing Sarah.  It may sound a bit preposterous in this review, but I'm not Doris Lessing.  In her hands, it comes off just fine.<br />As for the ending, I'm not going to give it away, but let's just say that Lessing is too melancholy to buy into the happily-ever-after scenario and she doesn't write fairy tales.  The ending is satisfying and fits the book perfectly.<br />\\"Love, Again,\\" is more than enough to satisfy anyone who is looking for an engrossing story with characters to really care about and believe in.  I wish I could find more books like this one.	2002-04-20

It's fairly long, not divided into chapters and, for the most part, lacks a plot.  Rather than plot, Lessing chooses to concentrate of the needs of family members instead...immediate family members and extended family members.  This is a book filled with \\"issues\\" and each character seems to have his or her opinion on each and every one of them.  If the book seems too long, consider this:  the pages are filled with so much dialogue during the discussion of these \\"issues\\" that they (the pages) simply fly by.  It really doesn't take long to read \\"The Sweetest Dream.\\"<br />I wouldn't say that this book is \\"about\\" anyone in particular, although its heart and soul is Frances Lennox a British actress and writer, who, at a very young age, made the mistake of marrying Johnny, a devout communist.  Although she attempted to correct that mistake, she seems to only become mired even more deeply in Johnny's troubled life and times.<br />Frances and her two teenaged boys are at home much of the time while Johnny cavorts in various parts of the world.  He only seems to light long enough to deposit yet another person on Frances' doorstep for her to take care of.  (The latest being Johnny's current wife.)  Frances finally finds a little peace and solace in the home of Johnny's widowed mother, Julia.  This is a house filled with misfits:  Frances' and Johnny's sons' friends and Sylvia, the troubled, anorxic daughter of Johnny's current wife.  Although Frances dreams of the theatre, the need for cash seems to trap her in the world of journalism instead.  Meantime, she's become the \\"family\\" caretaker and caregiver, much to Julia's distress.<br />Why doesn't Frances tell the selfish and self-centered Johnny when to quit?  After all, his own mother thinks he's a cad, a brute, a loser.Frances, though, just keeps on lavishing love while her dreams of the theatre and a real man by her side seem to be slipping away.  To find out whether they really do or not, you'll have to read the book.<br />While \\"The Sweetest Dream\\" is a very well-written novel with a premise that seems to have all the requirements, as I read, I realized that something was missing from the narrative.  It is passion, fire.  The characters seem almost defeated from the start.  While believable, they are somewhat flat.  I think Lessing needed to delve more deeply into their hearts and souls.  It is only in the book's final development that Lessing really lets us care.  And no, it isn't too late.<br />In the final analysis, however, \\"The Sweetest Dream,\\" though a little flat, is still a wonderful book and one any fan of Doris Lessing absolutely should not miss.	2002-04-17

Through a series of poignant letters to both God and to her sister, Nettie, Celie tells us the turbulent story of her life and the events that shaped it...events ranging from childhood abuse to success and wealth as an adult.<br />I realize that this book is often assigned to high school students, but that does not mean it is easy reading...not by a long shot.  The themes presented in \\"The Color Purple\\" are very adult and very advanced.  Additionally, the pictures Walker paints of Celie's abuse (both emotional and physical) are extraordinarily vivid and may upset some more sensitive readers, no matter what their age.  They will certainly leave a lasting imprint on any reader who is not completely and totally hard-hearted.<br />Celie is a woman who, despite the extreme hardships of her life, possesses intelligence, good humor, sensitivity and kindness in abundance.  It is very easy to become attached to the generous and strong Celie and feel both extreme sympathy for her and empathy with her.  Although much of this complex book is dark and oppressive, the last third is quite uplifting and well worth the wait.<br />This is a well-written book but I did think the sad scenes were a touch too melodramatic and the happy scenes slightly over-romanticized.  The book is so good, however, that I'm willing to overlook what I felt was a small fault.  The characters are so good, so lifelike, so fully-drawn, that any over-dramatization is easily forgiven.<br />It might be difficult for some readers to become accustomed to the rather strange style of Celie's letters.  Celie is an uneducated girl and her language shows it.  My advice would be to persevere, keep reading and in just a little while anyone will become so caught up in Celie's story, that the letters will flow and the pages will simply fly by.<br />Some readers might find this book simply too depressing to read.  If they do, then they are missing its central message and theme.  Yes, much of the book does consist of tragic happenings and depressing scenes, but ultimately, \\"The Color Purple\\" is a triumph, one of the most uplifting and even joyous books I have yet to read.<br />\\"The Color Purple\\" is a book in which men are the \\"bad guys\\" and women the \\"good guys.\\"  I have heard some readers complain about this.  Those who do must consider the time period in which this story is set.  Celie was born in the late 1800s...a time in America when men were quite dominating and women were relagated to a \\"backseat\\" role in life.  Their will was subjugated to the will of the men in their life.  It is no surprise that Celie draws both strength and love from the women around her rather than from the men.<br />Life, during Celie's day was extremely difficult, especially for a woman.  But Celie is an extraordinary person...a person who knows how it feels to be abused, oppressed and subjugated into almost total annihilation.  And, she also knows the joy of surviving, and overcoming, that abuse and oppression.  She knows how it feels to find strength within herself, to become content, peaceful and serene.  Ultimately, Celie is a woman who finds the capacity within her to create her own life and she creates a life filled with the magic of love.<br />I think anyone who can find it in his or her heart to not love Celie must be missing a vital piece of that heart.  Celie is the most unforgettable character I have yet to meet and she is the fictional character who most tugged at my heart and burrowed into my soul.  \\"The Color Purple\\" is more than a novel.  It is a triumph of the spirit of man.  Or, more precisely, it is the triumph of the spirit of one extraordinary woman, a woman anyone would be proud to know.	2002-04-17

Not only is the narrative unprecedented, it is a suspenseful and engrossing account of a young slave who &quot;passes&quot; for white in her attempt to find her way to freedom.<br />The bondwoman is Hannah Crafts, a mulatto and a slave, who wrote her story as an autobiographical novel.  Hannah Crafts was not uneducated, she was self-educated.  And, as anyone familiar with world literature will realize, Hannah Crafts, may have been very well educated, indeed.  As we read her story, written in an effusive style, we realize that she was well aware of the limitations and injustices society inflicted on persons of color in 19th century America.  What she didn't realize is that the freedom and life of the plantation's mistress is soon to be in as much peril as is her own and that their destinies will intertwine.  Is Hannah Crafts story an autobiographical rendition or is it a flight of fancy, albeit a very good flight of fancy?  I think it is up to each individual reader to judge.<br />&quot;The Bondwoman's Narrative&quot; really doesn't tell us anything new about the times in which Hannah Crafts lived.  It's significance lies not in the facts it presents (although they are interesting), but in its historical value.  The fact that this is, quite probably, the first narrative to have been written by a black woman makes &quot;The Bondwoman's Narrative&quot; unique and unprecedented and a true literary event.<br />Almost as interesting as the story of Hannah, herself, is Professor Gates' introduction in which he details his own search for the real Hannah Crafts and the true facts of her life.<br />Although the details in this book are details we have read before,perhaps several times before, we have not read them as presented by Hannah Crafts.  The experience of slavery was important in shaping the character of America and, because of this importance, Hannah Crafts' voice is a voice that should be heard.  I don't think anyone who reads this unique and sometimes very lovely book, will ever regret it.	2002-04-16

It is hypnotic and evocative, gorgeous and harrowing.  It is certainly one of the very best books I've read in a long, long time.<br />Marie Claire is a small French Jewish girl who lives with her grandmother in a Belgian village near the border of France.  In fact, Tournai was once a part of France, itself, and its ties to Christianity are strong.  As Kelby so lyrically writes, \\"Conquered by the French, it was thought more beautiful than Paris. Conquered by the English, it was the favored city of King Henry the Eighth.  It was also a city of God, or so it was said.\\"  Certainly the people of Tournai see God.  They see Him in their prayers and they see Him in the everyday stuff of life:  The baker sees God in a cherry tart, the barber sees the Virgin's face on the floor of his shop and the butcher finds a small cross in the belly of a lamb.  Yet, the people of Tournai are not happy; they feel that somehow, for some unknown reason, God has deserted their beautiful and loving village. <br />Marie Claire's grandmother was known for her beautiful garden and cultivating flowers was her hobby.  In fact, she names a rare black iris in Marie Claire's honor, because the little girl's hair is so very black.  Marie Claire, like generations of the Durrieu family before her, lives a life that is as deeply rooted in the soil as are the beautiful flowers she is learning to tend.  When World War II encroached upon their village, however, Marie Claire finds that her world is shattered.<br />Two Belgian nuns, a Mother Superior and a young postulant, find Marie Claire hiding in the root cellar and they take her to their convent.  There, in a town scented with the chocolates for which it is famous, the miracles of love that surrounded Marie Claire and saved her from capture by the Nazis, continue.  Miracles that are always accompanied by the overpowering scent of roses.<br />The two nuns, who are the only surviving Sisters of His Divine and Most Sacred Blood, are Sister Xavier and Sister Anne.  These sisters have secrets of their own.  Sister Xavier's parents are involved in genetic studies for the Third Reich.  In addition, one of Sister Xavier's closest friends has suffered greatly at the hands of a commander in Hitler's army.  And Sister Xavier does not plan to let these crimes go unpunished.<br />Sister Anne is a woman dealing with ghosts.  Far from being involved with Hitler, Sister Anne's parents were the victims of love.  Her mother was, perhaps, a hysteric, and her father was a man too weak to protect his own daughter from the woman he loved.  And then there is the street artist.  Sister Anne must deal with his ghost as well.<br />This is a book in which ghosts inhabit space side by side with the living.  \\"The dead walk,\\" Kelby writes, \\"the living rot away inch by inch...logic no longer applies.\\"  Logic certainly doesn't apply in this beautiful, but grim, story, so reminiscent of a fairy tale, and we are glad it doesn't.  Lost in the mystery of faith and the horror or war, both saint and sinner continue to love.  Tournai was, after all, a city of four hundred bells.  God might be hiding, but how could he not be hiding among them?<br />This is an extraordinarily poetic book; I don't think it would have worked had it been written any other way.  Kelby's prose is spare but metaphorical, and it is perfect for her subject matter.  She really makes us feel the fear, the love, the loss, the betrayal, the forgiveness.  We can see the death and the destruction, we can smell the chocolates and the roses.<br />Who would have guessed that in such a slim novel one could find the strands of so many lives and so many emotions woven into so many different patterns?  Much of what this book details is unspeakable:  unspeakable sorrow, unspeakable hope, unspeakable horror, unspeakable love.  Kelby tells her hypnotic story as though she were relating a dream; each word she chooses seems to be the perfect one for this small but powerful, yet somehow, ethereal novel.<br />This is an exquisite book but one that is sometimes almost too painful too read...and, at other times, too beautiful.  Once you pick up this harrowing, yet luminous book you will not be able to put it down.  You will have to know how, and why, and who, brought God back to Tournai.  But you will not find out until this book's very last pages.  Kelby writes of the most sublime spirituality without a trace of the sentimentality usually found in such a book.  And, the ending will definitely surprise you.  It will surprise you and it will not let you go.  \\"In the Company of Angels\\" is a book that will haunt both your waking and dreaming hours long after you've finished the very last page; you will be glad that it does.	2002-04-16
US	38577070	R3EFNNGSFERSYI	0671510053	357229344	The Shipping News	Books	3	10	11	N	N	The Patience of Job	&quot;The Shipping News&quot; is the story of Quoyle, a man who doesn't quite fit in...anywhere.  He wasn't the greatest son, or the greatest husband, or the greatest father, or even the greatest employee.  Still, we can't help but like Quoyle because he knows he isn't the greatest and he cares.  He wants to do something about it.  He gets his chance when his wife, Petal, abducts and sells their two young daughters and then is killed in an auto accident.<br />Quoyle's Aunt makes a sudden and quite fortuitous appearance, en route to her ancestral home, a small fishing village in costal Newfoundland.  She suggests that Quoyle and his daughters (yes, he gets them back, and it gives absolutely nothing of the plot away to let you know this) tag along with her and, needing a change of pace, Quoyle agrees.<br />In Newfoundland, Quoyle's luck doesn't really seem to improve much.  He finds work at the local paper, &quot;The Gammy Bird,&quot; covering the &quot;shipping news,&quot; which basically entails reporting which ships have docked and which have just left port.  He meets a variety of interesting people and, along the way, he tries to improve his life.  Does he succeed?  Yes and no.<br />I found &quot;The Shipping News&quot; to be both good and not so good, in very different ways.  It's a slow book and one in which it takes a very long time to become engrossed.  It is a book that has to &quot;grow on you.&quot;  I know other books are like this, but none of them should be.  Whether quiet or thriller, melancholy or madcap, a good book (and a good writer) grab the reader on the very first page and pull him in, with the very first sentence, if possible.  The characters in &quot;The Shipping News&quot; are very interesting, eccentric characters who want to make changes in their lives, but we didn't see that until far too many pages had been turned.<br />Proulx's style of writing is different.  Choppy, with missing verbs, incomplete sentences.  This would have been fine with me, (I enjoy it when an author tries something new with style), but Proulx didn't vary the choppy sentences with any longer ones.  She wouldn't have had to compromise her style to give us a little break from the staccato rhythm of her story.  As it was, it almost gave me a headache. <br />The descriptions of Newfoundland were beautiful.  Maybe a little too beautiful.  Proulx seemed to care more about &quot;selling&quot; us on the beauties of Newfoundland than she seemed to care about her characters.  These were very good characters, marvelous creations (despite far too many &quot;cute&quot; names), but they simply didn't do anything that could cause us to care about what happened to them and to their lives.  And whose fault was that?<br />I realize this is a quiet book about a quiet man attempting to make quiet changes in his life.  But quiet doesn't have to mean slow and ponderous and yes, sometimes boring.  It really does take the patience of Job to finish all of this book.<br />And what about the symbolism?  I like symbolism in a book.  I think it adds much to the atmosphere, but the symbolism in &quot;The Shipping News&quot; was heavy-handed, to say the least.  The book was meant to be bleak, I realize that, and it works best bleak, but the symbolism could have used a lighter touch.  Proulx could have trusted her readers a little more.  We do get it; we really don't need to be hit over the head...every time.<br />I very much prefer character driven books over plot driven books, but I do need for the characters to do something or feel something or be involved with something.  To simply sit there and wait just isn't enough.<br />The end of the book almost works.  It would have worked if Proulx could have resisted the urge to give us that heavy-handed bit of foreshadowing.  I didn't expect or want the book to end in a sugar-and-spice happily-ever-after scenario, so I'm glad Proulx didn't give in to that.<br />I don't know what more I can say about &quot;The Shipping News.&quot;  Parts of it were ponderous and parts of it were beautiful.  Parts of it were very beautiful.  I think they were just the wrong parts.	2002-04-15
US	38577070	R1RSDN7VZ0R15R	0811214850	850711751	Vertigo	Books	5	24	27	N	N	Speaking in Silence	The late W.G. Sebald wrote books of uncommon beauty, but, much to his credit, they are books that are extremely difficult to classify.  Are they fiction, biography, memoir?  Yes, they are all these and much, much more.  When reading a book written by W.G. Sebald, one has to remember that what he doesn't write is just as important as what he does; his is truly a \\"sound of silence\\" in which the seemingly endless repetitions and comparisons conjure up more variations on theme than anyone could possible catalogue.<br />\\"Vertigo\\" is a book that consists of four sections that are not completely related to one another and would have made just as much sense (or so it seems) if told in a different order.  These various sections tell of journies made to Vienna, Venice, Verona, Riva, and finally to Sebald's childhood home in the mountains of southern Germany.  The journies fold and refold themselves into one another, becoming a part of one another until we're not quite sure which is which.  The travels of Sebald echo the travels of Kafka, while the travels of Kafka echo those of Stendhal.  Sebald, himself, encounters Dante in the Duomo, King Ludwig II on a vaporetto and the daughter of James I at Heidelberg Station.  What is real?  What is not?  Sebald never gives us any clear-cut answers, for that was never the purpose of his journey, nor of this book.<br />The first section of \\"Vertigo\\" is a third-person biographical sketch of a nineteenth-century Napoleonic soldier named Beyle and it begins with Napoleon's crossing of the Alps into Austrian Italy.  Sebald has, himself, perused Beyle's own journals for the material that make up this sketch.  It is to Sebald's credit, at least in my estimation, that he never mentions the fact that Beyle is the birth name of the French novelist, Stendhal.  Sebald had far too much respect for our own intelligence to \\"spell it all out.\\"<br />The important questions raised in this section are:  \\"How reliable is memory?\\" and, \\"Are memories, even when they conflict with facts, still reliable indicators of personal experience?\\"  Sebald, of course, is dwelling on his own cultural heritage and the fact that the \\"official\\" history of Germany is one that has been written and rewritten in an effort to make it more palatable to those not directly involved.<br />In the second section of the book, Sebald moves to the first-person as a nameless, faceless narrator (who both is and is not, Sebald) travels over the same landscape as did Stendhal:  a garden in Verona, the Duomo in Milan, the mist-shrouded Doge's Palace in Venice, the winding alleys of Vienna.  Here, the narrator seems to be pursued by ghosts, the ghost of Dante, Casanova and King Ludwig of Bavaria.  \\"Is it possible,\\" he seems to be asking, \\"to endure that which is totally unendurable?\\"<br />The third section is one of the most imaginative and, shifting to the third person once again, Sebald narrates Franz Kafka's 1913 journey from Prague to Riva, Italy on the beautiful Lago di Garda.  This is a gorgeous, almost playful recapitulation of the second section and it should be read quietly, carefully and slowly in order to get the most out of it.<br />The fourth and final section details Sebald's 1987 visit to his own birthplace in Germany.  For Sebald, being German meant carrying something incurable, something akin to Stendhal's syphilis.  Even the German countryside seems to have taken on a surreal quality.  Its well-built houses with their sparkling clean windows and neat woodpiles bear no resemblance to the Germany Sebald left so many years ago.  As Sebald contemplates this antiseptic cleansing of Germany and his own inability to escape his \\"Germanness,\\" the vertigo of the book returns to haunt him.  Has his generation been the victim or the perpetrator of a massive swindle of denial?  Have they bartered away their innocence for nothing?<br />Although \\"Vertigo\\" is a more abstract and difficult book than Sebald's masterpiece, \\"The Emigrants\\" (which is also composed of four sections), the two books do depict the same subject matter...Germans who must, but cannot, face their own Germanness.  Emigrants who have not only left their country of origin, but have lost it as well.  People who are, of necessity, on the verge of a quiet, introspective madness.  \\"While it might have been rare for a man to be driven insane,\\" writes Sebald, \\"little was required to tip the balance.\\" <br />Sebald's closing warning to his readers is also an echo, an echo of the warning sign found in the London Underground:  \\"Mind the gap.\\"  Mind the gap between truth and lies, between fiction and reality, between history and propaganda, between what we know and what we only think we know, between forgetting and remembering.  <br />\\"Vertigo\\" is surely a book worth remembering.	2002-04-15
US	38577070	RCNIXLIO7AJNK	0786707739	50158188	According to Queeney	Books	5	11	12	N	N	The Darker Side of Samuel Johnson	Beryl Bainbridge seems to be an author people either love or hate; there just doesn't seem to be much inbetween.  Personally, I love her books and I think she certainly must be one of today greatest living authors.<br />\\"According to Queeney\\" is, in my opinion, one of Bainbridge's very best.  In this book she tells us much about the life and times of Samuel Johnson, the 18th century poet, editor of Shakespeare, journalist, critic, lexicographer, novelist, biographer and playwright.<br />Most people owe what they do know about Samuel Johnson to James Boswell whose biography of Johnson is considered by many to be the greatest biography ever written and surely the greatest ever written in the English language.  Boswell, however, committed a grave error when he wrote his biography of Johnson; he fell in love with his subject matter.  Boswell revered Johnson so much that he simply couldn't bring himself to include the darker side of Johnson's life, and it did have its darker side.  It is this side...the darker one...that Bainbridge explores in \\"According to Queeney.\\"  As anyone who's ever engaged in gossip knows, our darker moments are far more interesting that are our lighter ones.  No wonder this book is so good.<br />Queeney really did exist and she really was acquainted with Johnson.  Her real name was Hester Maria Thrale and she was the eldest daughter of Hester Lynch Thrale and Henry Thrale, a wealthy, 18th century brewer who just happened to be Johnson's closest friend and confidante.  Queeney is even mentioned in Boswell's biography of Johnson; she died in 1858, at the age of ninety-four, so she was no doubt the last surviving person to actually know Johnson personally.<br />The lives of Johnson and the Thrale's were intertwined, to some extent, for a full twenty years.  Johnson retained his own room in the home of the Thrales, called \\"Streatham Park,\\" and he even taught Latin to the Thrale children.  His confidante extraordinaire became Mrs. Thrale, and, by allaccounts, she came to know the deeper, darker side of the great Samuel Johnson.<br />Bainbridge has chosen to tell her story of Johnson from several viewpoints, all to the good, I think.  We encounter an omniscient, third-person narrator; an assortment of Johnson's friends; Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, of course; Johnson's housekeeper; Mrs. Desmoulins, a one-time companion to Johnson's wife; and Queeney, the most important and by far, the most captivating.  Queeney's story is told in her own voice and through a series of genuine letters that are strewn throughout the book.  The letters were written years after Johnson's death and are in the form of reminiscences.  They give us a very vivid picture of Samuel Johnson, not according to Boswell, but, as Bainbridge tells us \\"according to Queeney.\\"<br />Bainbridge's (and Queeney's) Samuel Johnson is a far darker, and more interesting personality than the one we meet in the pages of Boswell's biography.  According to Queeney, Johnson was a man who suffered from frequent bouts of melancholia, was sexually repressed, had a morbid fear of death and even showed some striking masochistic tendencies.<br />\\"According to Queeney\\" opens with Johnson's autopsy (right away, we know this is going to be a \\"dark\\" book), and works its way backwards.  The action then focuses on the year 1766; Johnson had known the Thrale's for about a year and Queeney was almost two years old.  Johnson, who was childless, definitely saw himself as a \\"father figure\\" to the charming and strong-willed Queeney (and her sisters) and he would be a major influence on her life for the next twenty years.<br />When Johnson met Queeney and the other Thrale's, he was already deeply mired in the mental and physical illness that plagued him for the rest of his life.  Bainbridge writes many engrossing set pieces and scenes in which Johnson confronts the demons that haunt his waking and sleeping hours.  These set pieces are all exquisitely and precisely written and provide a vivid portrait of Johnson...as he really was.<br />Johnson was, as we are shown (not told), a man who constantly wavered between madness and wisdom.  While Boswell would have us believe that Johnson was remarkable for only his virtues, Bainbridge generously lets us know that he was also remarkable for his weaknesses, especially masochism.  This doesn't, however, make Johnson thoroughly unlikable; Bainbridge presents Johnson as supremely human, a man who was beset by vices, but who didn't give in to them willingly.<br />For those who are familiar with Boswell's portrait of Samuel Johnson, Bainbridge should be required reading.  She balances the portrait, letting us see the dark side of Johnson as well as the light.  Personally, I find Bainbridge's book, and Bainbridge's Johnson, the more interesting.  But the real star of \\"According to Queeney,\\" is, on every count, Queeney, herself.  \\"According to Queeney\\" is thoroughly engrossing, thoroughly absorbing, read.	2002-04-14

Rose seems to think that out of sight is definitely out of mind.<br />When we meet Rose, she is a very confused, Catholic woman who realizes after some years of marriage (and despite the fact that she's pregnant), that she simply doesn't love her husband anymore.  Perhaps she never did.  Rather than getting help from her local priest or even a marriage counselor and, even short of confiding in her husband (about her lack of love for him or her pregnancy), Rose does what Rose does best...she simply leaves.<br />With no destination in mind and no money (Rose's preferred method of travel), Rose ends up in a home for unwed mothers in Kentucky.  She lies to the nuns about her family and eventually meets Son, the handsome, charismatic handyman at the home.  All the pregnant girls are in love with Son, but of course, it is Rose who ends up snaring him...and marrying him.  The fact that Rose already has a husband is simply glossed over.  This is a woman who doesn't want to be bothered with details.<br />Fifteen years later, Son is a good father to Cecilia, the daughter that isn't really his...at least in a biological sense.  Whether Rose is a good (second) wife and mother, is a more subjection question.<br />Rose and Son have inherited the mansion belonging to the founder of the home and while both Son and Cecilia are happy to live there, Rose chooses instead to live in Son's small cabin.  It seems, for reasons not made completely clear, that this woman simply can't bear life in a mansion with her gorgeous husband and daughter.  Strange?  Maybe for you and I, but definitely not for our Rose.  She seems to feel a compulsion to do everything more than just a bit off-key.<br />Complications arise when Rose receives a letter from her first, and real, husband.  It won't take a very astute reader to guess what Rose does next and it gives nothing of the plot away to say that yes, she does.  She leaves.<br />This is a very forgiving book, however, and it ends on a very cliched note...with a miracle.  A hot spring that had been dormant since the 1930s begins to bubble and flow.  And all due to Rose, no doubt!<br />To say that this book has unlikable characters is putting it mildly.  Rose is the most selfish and self-centered character I've encountered in a long time, in fiction or in real life.  Her propensity for running away was as tiresome as a child's temper tantrum and when she finally did decide to face something she, herself, had created, her motivation for doing so was vague and cliched.

I can't for the life of me understand why it was even published, let alone made into a television play.

Bulgakov, who finished the book in 1938, died in 1940 (I think) and so never knew how the world finally came to love his masterpiece.  Like other Russian authors of his time, he was plagued with censorship and none of his works was published in Russia during his lifetime.<br />\\"The Master and Margarita,\\" a satire of Stalinist Russia, remains as fresh and funny and ultimately, as sad, today as it no doubt did when Bulgakov wrote it.  To say that this novel is multi-layered is putting it mildly.  This book is a madcap tour de force; something akin to a Grand Prix auto race with absolutely no pit stops allowed.  In my opinion, only \\"Lolita\\" can match it for its scathing hilarity.<br />As the book opens, magazine editor, Belioz and poet, Bezdomny sit on a park bench near Patriarch Ponds discussing the nonexistence of God (this is Stalinist Russia, so they certainly wouldn't be discussing His existence).  During the course of their discussion, they encounter an ominous third person, someone who is definitely not from Moscow, who begins to question them regarding their nonbelief.  He assures them that God is very much alive and, as if to prove his assertion, he predicts the very manner of Berlioz' death...a prediction that comes true all too quickly.<br />Is this well-dressed stranger who knows too much God, Himself?  Hardly.  I don't want to give away the plot of this rollercoaster of a book, so I will just say that the stranger is going by the name of Woland and claims to be a practitioner of black magic.  \\"The\\" practitioner of black magic.  He is not alone in his visit to Moscow; he has, in fact, a retinue (one of the best of these characters is Azazello) and he and his followers propose to put on a public show.  (This show, incidentally, is one of the highlights of the book and there are many, many highlights.)<br />Entertwined with this narrative is a second narrative, seemingly quite different, but really a parallel.  This second narrative is the story of a certain Roman Procurator and his reluctance to crucify a man called Yeshua.  The second narrative is written in a completely different style than the one that takes place in Russia, which is just one more proof (if anymore are needed) of the genius of Bulgakov.  We soon learn, however, that the narrative of Yeshua is being written by a psychiatric hospital inmate known only as \\"The Master.\\"  Driven insane (or almost insane) by the inequities of the times and the resulting despair, \\"The Master\\" has burned his manuscript and deserted his mistress, the charming Margarita.<br />Woland proves to be very good at drumming up business for a madhouse.  The asylum, run by a Dr. Stravinsky, no less, begins to welcome new arrivals on an almost daily basis, new arrivals who all had the misfortune to cross paths with Woland.<br />While Moscow goes insane, however, Woland proceeds with his plans to give a Grand Ball and he begins his search for a hostess...a hostess who must be named, \\"Margarita.\\"  As anyone who has ever read Faust will know, Margarita is a Faustian reference and, in this book, she is a reference in more than name only.  The beautiful Margarita has never forgotten her beloved Master and as she attempts to locate him, her path crosses with Woland's.<br />I won't give away the story, but I will tell you that Woland's Grand Ball does take place and a grand ball it is.  The denouement of this book is a display of skill and wit that I have yet to encounter in any other book so far.  So many books are guilty of hyperbole when they say the ending will \\"leave the reader breathless.\\"  This books comes as close to that as any I know.<br />Don't think you absolutely must have a knowledge of Russia or of Russian politics to understand and enjoy this book.  You don't.  You simply have to be an intelligent reader.  There is, however, a subtext inthis book that only those with some knowledge of Stalinist Russia will \\"get.\\"<br />I have only read the Mirra Ginsburg translation of this novel, so cannot comment on translations, but I do know that some of the other translations come with extensive annotations and there is a companion guide for this book that can be purchased separately.<br />I certainly didn't do this wonderful book justice in this review, but then I didn't expect to.

The story takes place in a Mexican border town around the year 1910.  Even though Tita and Pedro are two young people very desperately in love, when Pedro asks for permission to marry Tita, her widowed, dictatorial mother, Mama Elena, denies it.  The way she sees things, it is the duty of her youngest daughter to carry on the family tradition and care for her...until the day she dies.  And, the youngest daughter just happens to be...Tita.  Mama Elena does have another plan in mind, however, and she suggests that Pedro marry her less marriageable, oldest daughter, Rosaura, instead.  Pedro accepts, but he has reasons that don't involve love...at least not love for Rosaura.<br />Brokenhearted, Tita proceeds to channel all of her passion and energy into her cooking instead.  Thinking of Pedro and knowing he will be her one and only love, Tita weeps into Pedro's and Rosaura's wedding cake as she prepares the batter.  This has very unusual consequences...when the guests eat the cake, they all beging to weep, overcome with nostalgia and sadness at the thought of their first love.  Even the hard-hearted Mama Elena is not unaffected.<br />The book is narrated by Tita's grand-niece (who seems to be Esquivel, herself), who has inherited Tita's beautiful, old book of handwritten recipes and her extraordinary talent for cooking.  While some of the recipes that Tita prepares are contained in \\"Like Water for Chocolate,\\" I wouldn't attempt them.  Without Tita's magic, they simply don't work, but they are very interesting.  The thrust of this story, however, remains on Tita and her love for Pedro.  And on Tita's cooking.<br />Unable to love Pedro outwardly, Tita continues to channel all of her love into her cooking.  When Pedro gives her a dozen roses as a sign of his continuing love for her, Tita is ordered to throw them away.  Ratherthan do that, however, she prepares quail with rose petal sauce.  The dish turns out to be a powerful aphrodisiac; the effects on Tita's sister, Gertrudis, are extraordinary and actually change the entire course of her life.<br />Legends abound in this book and one of the most powerful says that if anyone experiences the height of emotion and love, a door to eternity will open, for just a second, allowing them to walk through.  This legend will come to have the most powerful influence of all.<br />Since this book seems to be made up old family stories, traditions and legends, it has a nostalgic feel to it as well as being a powerful love story.  And, despite this being a love story, the emphasis is on the six women characters; men hover at the periphery of this book and their personalities are not highly developed.<br />Of course, things do not proceed smoothly for Pedro and Rosaura, but then they do not proceed smoothly for Pedro and Tita, either.  Or do they?  Given the book's ending, I found it difficult to decide.  But the book did end in a very fitting manner and one that was very satisfying.<br />The title of the book is particularly apt.  In Mexico, hot chocolate is very strong and is made with water rather than with milk.  The water is brought to a boil and then the chocolate is spooned into it (there is one scene in the book in which hot chocolate is made).  A person in the throes of romantic excitement is said to be in a state \\"like water for chocolate.\\"<br />In \\"Like Water for Chocolate,\\" almost everyone seems to be in this heightened state, at least part of the time.  And the catalyst is always the passionate Tita, who pours her life and herself into her cooking, creating food so filled with magic that it can make people laugh or cry or literally catch fire with desire.<br />\\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" inspired the appearance of many \\"food oriented\\" books, but none of them even came close to catching the magic and the passion of this one.  This is an entertaining book and one that is quite unique.  It should be very enjoyable reading for anyone.	2002-04-13

It's chock full of poetic gems, yet each one is so different.  The differences in variety are surprising...there are different moods, cadences, emphases.<br />The poems are arranged in broad categories and follow a rather natural progression from the joys of meeting to the pleasures and pains of being &quot;in love,&quot; to an absence of one's beloved and past loves.<br />Some poets are represented more extensively than are others.  These include John Donne, Boris Pasternak, Anna Akhmatova and Christina Rossetti, among others.  I don't think anyone who loves good poetry will complain about his disproportionate representation, however.  The poets named above are so good, and their ideas so universal, that not repeating them would have been the mistake.<br />Although all of these poems concentrate on a universally recognized aspect of love, the perspectives vary sharply.  There are poems from ancient India, classical Greece, medieval Japan, renaissance England, 19th century France and modern-day America.<br />The one quality all of these poems share is first-rate writing.  You will no doubt find some poems you prefer over others, but you won't find poems that are &quot;better&quot; than others.  They are all of the highest quality.<br />Another thing I like about this series of books is their size.  They're small enough to carry in a purse or even a laptop case.  I read mine on the train, on the bus, while waiting for the bus, anywhere, really.  I couldn't think of a way to improve them.	2002-04-12

Two middle-aged poets, Thomas Janes, a major poet, and Linda Fallon, a rather minor one, meet after many years at a Canadian writers' conference.  Janes and Fallon, we learn, were once lovers, but apparently their lives took very different paths and each married and made a home with another.  Now, however, both Janes and Fallon are free of romantic entanglements and free to be together.  But will they take advantage of their freedom?  Can they?  These questions are pivotal because nothing in this book is what it seems to be.<br />\\"The Last Time They Met\\" is divided into three sections:  \\"Fifty-Two,\\" \\"Twenty-Six,\\" and \\"Seventeen,\\" representing the ages at which Janes and Fallon meet.  The narrative, in terms of linear time, runs backwards...for a very good reason.<br />I found much of the prose in this book to be melodramic, cliched or simply bad.  In any event, there's nothing about it to lift<BR>it above the very, very ordinary.  Combined with the ho-hum storyline and cliched characters this doesn't leave us with much of anything.  <br />As a frequent visitor to Africa, I found the African section to be very poorly written.  And the letters; they all sound as though they were written by the very same person...Shreve.<br />A lot of reviewers have complained about the ending of this book and, in my opinion, their complaints are more than justified.  Like some of the other readers, I could see the ending coming as soon as I began the book...the italicization, the backward timeline and the peculiar phrasing of some of the dialogue were all huge giveaways.  Those readers who didn't see the end coming, however, have every right to feel cheated and used.  Literary \\"gimmicks\\" rarely work (and they certainly aren't a substitute for good writing) and the one used in this book was a particularly cheap one.<br />Anita Shreve certainly didn't make a fan out of me with this book and I won't be giving her another chance.  In fact, she may have scared me away from \\"pop\\" literature (even the good stuff) for good.	2002-04-12
US	38577070	R2NKPGZHAVWBP4	0312278586	244886090	The Nanny Diaries: A Novel	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Sad but All Too True	I was surprised that \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" was really a good book.  Usually books fail to live up to their hype and this one was hyped to high heaven.  In some respects, \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" was not what I expected; in other respects, it was more.<br />Nan (who is called \\"Nanny\\") is the perfect person to care for a child.  She graduated from a prestigious Manhattan school, she possesses all the personal characteristics one would want in a caregiver and she's simply a nice person in the bargain.<br />Nan is hired by the \\"Xes,\\" a very wealthy Park Avenue couple to care for their four year old son, Grayer.  At $10 an hour, Nan is a steal.  She gives Grayer all the things the selfish and self-centered Xes seem unable to give...love, attention, time...the things any normal four year boy needs in order to develop into a self-sufficient adult.<br />It is, of course, Nanny and not Mr. or Mrs. X who takes Grayer to his music lessons, swimming lessons, karate lessons, piano lessons, French lessons, etc.  Grayer is the typical New York \\"rich kid\\" and his days are booked to the hilt.  It is Nanny who sees that he gets through those days.  <br />It is also Nanny who sees that Grayer gets through his nights.  She's the one who's there when Grayer has a nightmare, the one who praises his childish efforts and rewards him with a hug or a kiss when he needs one.  Although Nanny doesn't \\"need\\" Grayer, he very definitely needs her.<br />Mrs. X seems to think that a nanny's job entails looking after her as well.  This really comes as no surprise since Mrs. X is more of a child (and less self-reliant) than is Grayer.  She expects Nanny to keep her supplied with lavender water, to make sure her alphabetized lingerie drawers stay alphabetized and to procure the French dairy substitutes she feels she must have.  It is a small miracle that the authors managed to conjure up some actual sympathy for Mrs. X.  I congratulate them.  She could have so easily slipped into the role of a caricature, yetshe didn't.<br />Mr. X, however, is a different story.  This man is a cad and that's actually a compliment.  He doesn't call upon Nanny so much as his mistress calls upon Nanny.  She calls upon her for oysters; she calls upon her to fetch her black lace thong from beneath the bed, she calls upon her...well, she calls upon her whenever the whim strikes her, and strike her it does.<br />\\"The Nanny Diaries\\" was written by two former students who spent a combined eight years working for people just like the Xes.  If their book is meant to be a social satire, it works, but it might not have come off quite as light as the duo hoped.  There is a deep-seated truth to all of this madness that makes \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" a little sad.  These absentee parents really do exist, and not just among the rich.  And, underpaid, overworked, loving caregivers like Nanny do exist, the unsung heroines of a child's lonely world.<br />The authors are wonderful with details and its the details that bring this story to life.  I laughed at the huge list of food-related allergies and found the description of the way Mrs. X and her friends scrupulously avoided physical contact with their offspring marvelous.  Marvelous writing, that is.<br />The only reason I gave this book four stars rather than five was the dialogue.  It is, I think, true to life and therein lies the problem.  It is too true to life.  Stark reality doesn't always make for good reading and good written dialogue is very different from the way people actually speak.<br />It is said that a book is only a strong as its villain factor and this one has a villain and a half.  The authors paint a truly horrifying portrait of Mr. X.  He is a cruel, callous, unfeeling monster...someone whose lack of emotional availability almost drives his family insane.<br />Although there is humor in \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" ultimately, it is a sad book simply because it is so true to its subject matter.  It is fitting that Nanny is absolutely horrified byall that goes on in the home of the Xes.  When Mrs. X spends a long-awaited Valentine's Day dinner sobbing with Nanny instead of enjoying the romantic tryst she'd envisioned, I knew that scene had to have been taken from real life rather than being a product of the authors' imagination.<br />Although she's nearly perfect, in her role as caregiver to Grayer, at least, Nanny is ultimately betrayed.  We do feel for her and care about her plight.<br />Although some people will no doubt laugh their way through \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" (and it is funny), the sad truth of the matter is...it is all too very, very true.  Perhaps we should thank the authors for bringing this to light.	2002-04-12

Although that's unfair to both Carey and McCarthy, it did get me to read this book.  And, I did find that Carey was something like McCarthy in that he is able to tell what is essentially an \\"outlaw\\" story and make is sound more like a myth.<br />I don't know anything of Ned Kelly other than what I read in this book, but in \\"The True History of the Kelly Gang,\\" at least, Ned Kelly seems not so much outlaw as rogue, more like Robin Hood than Billy the Kid.  This is a book with all the cruelty, murder and barbarism of McCarthy's books, yet \\"The True History of the Kelly Gang\\" seems to have a strain of likable sentimentality as well.  I liked Ned Kelly and I liked this book. <br />I've read, of course, that despite this book having been written in the first person, Ned Kelly did not write it.  This is historical fiction, not an autobiographical work, but it's so good, who cares?  And, it is based on actual events.<br />Carey based this book on a letter the real Ned Kelly wrote after robbing a bank.  The book (history) is ostensibly written by Kelly to his daughter so she would always know the truth about her father, both the good and the bad, rather than having to rely on folk tales and rumor. <br />\\"The True History of the Kelly Gang\\" has an episodic feel to it, since, rather than being conventionally plotted, adventure is piled upon adventure upon adventure.  There's not a lot of humor in this book and not much self-reflection; self-reflection from one such as Ned Kelly might have seemed absurd.  If you think about it long enough, the very idea of Ned Kelly writing his memoirs seems absurd, but just don't think about it too much.  Enjoy the book instead.<br />Ned Kelly was a very poor Irish immigrant, as most of the poor in Australia were at the time the Kelly Gang roamed the land.  They lived in hovels and struggled to even put bread on their plates, let alone make a decent living.  This fact alone causes us to have sympathy with Ned Kelly right off the bat.  Their heroes were people just like Ned Kelly, so at the age of fifteen, Kelly was sent to the famous \\"bushranger,\\"<BR>Harry Power, by his own mother, no less, to learn the art and craft of \\"outlawing.\\"<br />Eastern Europeans aren't known for their knowledge of Australian history, so for me, at least, this was a book filled with surprises and rich historical background.  And, although I did say the book didn't have much humor, it does have absurdity (I am thinking of a scene in which the Kelly Gang blackened their faces, donned women's dresses and rode on their horses acting out Irish myths.  If this seems hysterically funny to you, you need to read the book.)  Ned Kelly seems to be a rare hybrid of Irishman and Australian, but perhaps that's not so rare at all.  I just don't know.  I do know that if you're looking for Crocodile Dundee, you won't find him in these pages and that's good, since Ned Kelly is so much more interesting and, surprisingly, just as easy to like.<br />For someone who grew up in Europe, the dialogue in this book, as well as the lack of conventional punctuation can be a little difficult, but only initially.  After a few pages, it begins to flow more easily.  Carey writes with a beautiful cadence that is really quite lovely to read.<br />I think \\"The True History of the Kelly Gang\\" really can't be compared to any other book at all.  I don't know that any other books regarding the outlaw culture of Australia exist.  Whatever Ned Kelly really was, I am glad Carey gave him, and his gang, a voice in this book.  As Kelly writes to his daughter, \\"...in the end we poor uneducated people will all be made noble in the fire.\\"  Perhaps it's true.	2002-04-12

Although I would call this a historical novel, Davidar really doesn't explain the historical background much and even his characters go about their daily lives without investing too much time in current events.<br />For the people of Chevathar, the village of the Dorai family, history is symbolized by a road made famous for the incredible sweetness of the blue mangoes that are native to the region.  This road turns out to be something of a mixed blessing.  The people of Chevathar seemed to be dealing with their caste system in an orderly fashion until this road came alone and upset the proverbial applecart.  Now, instead of the paths designated for each caste, everyone seems to take the road lined by the blue mangoes.  This, of course, causes problems and even the Dorai family become victims.  Their patriarch, Solomon, is beset with problems, while his elder son, Aaron wanders into a life of crime...with terrible consequences.<br />Daniel, Aaron's younger brother, decides not to let politics and social problems ruin his life the way they had ruined his father's and brother's.  He invents a skin-whitening cream called, &quot;Dr. Dorai's Moonwhite Thylam.&quot;  Rescuing the family home from destruction, Daniel renames it Neelan Illum, or &quot;The House of Blue Mangoes.&quot;  Daniel loses no time in letting his entire family know they are welcome at &quot;The House of Blue Mangoes&quot; but only if they agree to leave politics and its poisonous fruit behind. <br />Of course, Daniel's plan does not work out, but his son, Kannan, does inherit Daniel's deep aversion to politics.  Davidar, himself, seems to share his characters' aversion to involvement in political and social strife.  In this novel, history serves only to ornament the background, not to shape the characters or drive the plot.  Being very apolitical myself, I thought I would like this aspect of the book, and I do, to a certain extent.  What I don't like is the fact that Davidar's characters, by their very refusal to even acknowledge the political turmoil around them, are rendered extraordinarily shallow.<br />I might have been able to tolerate ignorant characters had they been fascinating in some other way, but the characters in this novel simply weren't.  They are flat and one dimensional and their problems seem to revolve around the cliche.  Davidar, himself, doesn't seem to care about his characters...or what happens to them.<br />What does seem to interest Davidar, and the thrust of this book, are details.  While Davidar doesn't bother to tell us a character's intimate thoughts, thus letting us get to know him and care about him, he does devote pages and pages to things like the sport of well-jumping, the traditional siddha medicinal practice, the social ins and outs of a proper afternoon tea, the best ways to hunt tiger, and the differences among the many varieties of mango.  And, while much of this is very interesting, it certainly doesn't make for a compelling novel.<br />Political and social problems aside, if Davidar had only lavished half as much care and development on his characters as he does on the details of the book, then &quot;The House of Blue Mangoes&quot; would have been an extremely interesting and involving book.  As it is, it is not even a great reference guide.	2002-04-12
US	38577070	R2FGGVHA2DKIN2	0940322714	344048125	Letters: Summer 1926 (New York Review Books Classics)	Books	5	47	47	N	N	In the Company of Angels	Words have tremendous power, and reading the letters written from one person to another often helps us to know that person far more intimately than anythng else ever could.<br />During the summer of 1926, three extraordinary poets (two Russian and one German) began a correxpondence of the highest order.  These three extraordinary people were Boris Pasternak, Marina Tsvetayeva and Ranier Maria Rilke.  Rilke, who is revered as a god by both Pasternak and Tsvetayeva, is seen by them as the very essence of poetry, itself.<br />None of these three correspondents is having a good year:  Pasternak is still living in Moscow, attempting to reconcile his life to the Bolshevik regime; Tsvetayeva has been exiled to France with her husband and children and is living in the direst financial straits, with each day presenting a new hurdle in the struggle to simply \\"get by;\\" Rilke's situation is perhaps the worst of all...he is dying of leukemia in Switzerland.<br />Pasternak and Tsvetayeva have already exchanged years of letters filled with the passion and romance of poetry, itself.  Although Pasternak saw Rilke briefly in 1900, Tsvetayeva has never laid eyes on her idol.  These three poets are, however, connected by a bond far stronger than the physical.  They are kindred spirits, and each find repetitions and echoes of himself in the other.<br />Tsvetayeva quickly becomes the driving force of this trio.  This is not surprising given her character.  She's the most outrageous of the three, the boldest, the neediest, the one most likely to bare her inner soul to its very depths.  Tsvetayeva's exuberance, however, eventually has disatrous effects.<br />Although Pasternak and Tsvetayeva consider Rilke their superior by far, these are not the letters of acolyte to mentor, but an exchange of thoughts and ideas among equals.  If you've ever read the sappy, sentimental \\"Letters to a Young Poet,\\" you'll find a very different Rilke in this book.  Gone is the grandiose, condescending Rilke.In his place we find an enthusiastic Rilke, one filled with an almost overwhelming \\"joie de vivre,\\" despite his sad circumstances.<br />As Susan Sontag says in her preface, these letters are definitely love letters of the highest order.  The poets seek to possess and consume one another as only lovers can.  But even these lovers haven't suspected that one of their trio is fatally ill.  Pasternak and Tsvetayeva are both shocked and devastated when Rilke dies.<br />Love, many people will argue, is best expressed when the people involved are able to spend time together.  There is, however, something to be said for separateness, for there is much that can only come to the surface when the lover is separated from the beloved.<br />These letters can teach us much about Rilke, Pasternak and Tsvetayeva.  They can also teach us much about the very depths of the soul...both its anguish and those sublime, angelic heights...areas not often explored by anyone, anywhere, at any time.	2002-04-12
US	38577070	R1VQGPVRMT3JPQ	0679728759	53277980	Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West	Books	5	351	381	N	N	The Sanctity of Blood	I've read all of Cormac McCarthy's earlier books set in Tennessee, such as \\"The Orchard Keeper\\" and \\"The Outer Dark\\" and I've read his \\"Border Trilogy\\" which contained the wonderful, \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\"  Nothing, however, that this wonderful author has written can prepare the reader for the sheer brutality and the sheer lyricism of \\"Blood Meridian.\\"<br />The Old West portrayed in \\"Blood Meridian\\" is not the Old West of Zane Grey or even of Larry McMurtry.  Images of the most horrific abound in \\"Blood Meridian,\\" (charred human bones, blood-soaked scalps, a tree hung with the bodies of dead infants), all rendered in McCarthy's gorgeously lyrical writing.<br />As far as I'm concerned, \\"Blood Meridian\\" is McCarthy's best book, by far.  It doesn't have the \\"feel good\\" qualities sometimes found in \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" but I didn't expect it to.  \\"Blood Meridian\\" is the book in which McCarthy makes crystal clear the one theme that runs through all of his writing:  the undeniable presence of evil in the world.  The fact that he writes about this evil in language so lyrical and so elaborately beautiful only intensifies the horror of it all.  We feel as though we have left the real world behind and entered into some surreal place from which no escape is possible.<br />\\"Blood Meridian,\\" which takes place in 1847, is loosely based on actual events and is the story of a fourteen boy, known only as \\"the Kid.\\"  Drifting through the American Southwest, the Kid joins a disparate and bloodthirsty band of Indian-hunters-for-hire led by a mysterious and learned man called, Judge Holden.<br />It is after the Kid joins Judge Holden and his band that McCarthy really hits his stride.  Juxtaposed next to descriptions of the most horrific and grotesque are images of the most sublime beauty.  Consider this description of a group of Indians, \\"...wardrobed out of a fevered dream with the skins of animals and silk finery...one in a stovepipe hat and one with an umbrella and one in whitestockings and a blood stained weddingveil.\\"  That's prose most authors would kill for.<br />McCarthy, unlike most writers who portray horror, concentrates not on the horrific images themselves, but on his characters' reactions to them.  I'm not at all surprised at this, for McCarthy is not a horror writer; he is a writer of literature of the very highest order.<br />Although many people would have expected McCarthy to keep his emphasis on the Kid, he chooses to concentrate on the character of Judge Holden instead.  Anyone who has read this book knows it was a good choice for the Judge is the dominant personality in \\"Blood Meridian\\" and all the other characters in this book are defined only in relation to the Judge.  It is also the Judge who exemplifies McCarthy's major themes and it is he (the Judge) who becomes a metaphorical and spiritual father to all of McCarthy's later characters.  <br />This is not a typical \\"Western novel,\\" not even a very, very good \\"Western novel.\\"  In this book, the line between the victims the perpetrators of evil is subtlely drawn...if it is drawn at all.  McCarthy seems to be telling us that all men are villains, all men are perpetrators, all men are bloodthirsty...if only the reward is high enough.  And for some, evil, itself is its own reward.<br />I am giving nothing away by saying that the ending of this book is a sophisticated and stylistic masterpiece involving both the Judge and the Kid.  The last image we have of the Judge is one that epitomizes the sheer lunacy of the man.  In a saloon where a trained bear dances on the stage, we see the Judge, \\"...naked, dancing...He says that he will never die.\\"  In a beautiful and enigmatic epilogue, however, McCarthy skillfully denies the Judge the last word in the novel.<br />This is a sophisticated and complex book, far more complex that it would appear on the surface or even after one reading.  It is filled with the Faulknerian prose that has become a McCarthy trademark (though McCarthyemployed it less in \\"The Border Trilogy\\").  These convoluted sentences, (in my opinion, far better than anything Faulkner ever wrote), can be difficult, since they contain within them the seed of all of McCarthy's writing.<br />This brilliant novel is more than just a book; it is an experience.  It is an experience of horror, of beauty, of the insanity of man.  Set in a time when man attempted to sanctify himself in the blood of other men, this is, without a doubt the rawest exposition of horror I have ever read, yet, at the same time, it is probably the most beautiful book I have ever read as well.  It is something that simply defies description.  Read it for yourself and see.	2002-04-12
US	38577070	R1A0TWHVRDFC13	0803261195	10963068	Artemisia (European Women Writers)	Books	5	24	24	N	N	An Absolute Triumph	Atemisia Gentileschi, born in Rome in 1598, is one of the most fascinating figures in the history of art, though very little is known about her life.  The daughter of a painter herself, Artemisia painted beautiful scenes of the women of Roman and biblical history even though she could neither read nor write.<br />Artemisia had, to put it mildly, a turbulent personal life.  She was discredited in a rape trial, betrayed by her own father and abandoned by her husband.  Her professional life, however, was far different.  She was the first woman admitted to the prestigious Florentine Academy; she established a successful art school in Naples; she raised her daughter on her own and supported herself financially during a time when a woman's life was defined only by home, husband, children and the Church.<br />Although the above is about the sum total of all that's known about Artemisia Gentileschi's life, writer, Anna Banti, managed to flesh out these bare bones facts into one of the triumphs of 20th century Italian literature.<br />\\"Artemisia\\" is definitely not a biography or even a fictionalized one.  It is not a historical work; in fact, the setting of this book is definitely ahistorical.  It consists of an amazing dialogue between the author and Artemisia.  There are, as way I see it, three levels in this book:  the experiences of Artemisia, the experiences of the author and a blending of the two, to make a very fascinating third.<br />The very essence of this book consists of Artemisia's travels, all made for the sake of her art.  Included are the young Artemisia's traumatic experiences in Rome, her marriage, her years of success in Naples, her long and undoubtedly arduous journey to England and back again to her native Italy.<br />One of the things that makes this book so powerful is Banti's constant authorial intrusion, a device that would weaken (or destroy) more conventional novels.  Moving back and forth from the thrid to the first person, Banti holds fascinatingconversations with Artemisia.  This leads to a captivating, but very complex, narrative.  As the dialogue between author and subject intensifies, Banti complicates matters even further.<br />In 1944, when the first version of \\"Artemisia\\" was nearly complete, events of the war caused it to be destroyed.  The \\"Artemisia\\" of the first version constantly intrudes on the \\"Artemisia\\" of the second version, however.  Confusing?  No, not really.  Banti is far too good a writer for that.  Complex?  Yes.  And lyrical and skillful and fragile.<br />Despite the fact that this is not a historical novel, it is highly atmospheric.  There are no detailed descriptions to weigh down the weightless quality of Banti's lyricism, but there are many vivid images of 17th century Rome, Naples, Florence, France.<br />No matter how fast you usually read, \\"Artemisia\\" is a novel that should be read slowly.  This is a demanding book that requires much concentration on the part of the reader, but this concentration will be richly rewarded.<br />There is a vague, circular quality about this book and, in a sense, it ends where it began.  In reality, however, nothing is known about Artemisia Gentileschi's life after her return to Italy from England.<br />This book is complex, intricate, self-reflective and extremely lyrical.  Although it has an ephemeral, gossamer quality, it succeeds wonderfully in bringing Artemisia Gentileschi to life in a vivid and wonderful manner.	2002-04-12

It is lush, beautiful and gorgeous.  And the glory of it is that it got that way with fine, first-rate writing.  You won't find any gimmicks or ... tricks here.<br />Unlike the movie, the book begins in war-torn Italy (1944) where we encounter Hana, a Canadian nurse and a horribly burned man known only as, \\"the English patient.\\"  Alone in an isolated, abandoned convent, Hana stays behind when her friends move on to care for the dying English patient.  Hana is a rare individual and truly caring.  She spends her days reading to the English patient from the volume of Herodotus that was found with him and, when his pain becomes too great, she injects him with morphine.<br />Hana and the English patient aren't alone long, however.  A mysterious man named Caravaggio soon arrives and it becomes clear that he has an agenda all his own.  Nevertheless, it is Caravaggio who succeeds with the English patient where others have failed.  This trio is soon joined by a Sikh named Kip, a man who will play a role in Hana's life, just as she will play a role in his.<br />Eventually, of course, we learn all about the English patient, who really isn't English at all, but a Hungarian count named, Almasy.  We learn where he's been and why and how he came to be so horribly burned.  We learn about the great love of his life, a love that sadly, was doomed from the very start.<br />This is a book that is told on two levels and contains two love stories.  One takes place in the past and the other takes place in the present.  While Hana's story is told in the present tense, it is not as involving or as intense as is the love story involving Almasy that takes place in the past.  I think this is because Hana and her lover are not as fully-realized as are Almasy and his lover, though Hana is by far the most sympathetic character in the book.<br />The character of Caravaggio is as mysterious as is the English patient.  We dolearn about him, however, and about his mysterious connection to Almasy.  The stories of Hana and Caravaggio are heartbreaking and heartbreakingly beautiful.<br />\\"The English Patient\\" is a quiet love story, one told without the necessity of melodrama or \\"fireworks.\\"  However, it is one that cuts deep, and one that any reader will remember long after the book is finished.  This is a story that simply rings with universal chords...of love, of loss, of sadness, of betrayal.<br />If I have one quibble with this book, it is with the denouement.  I didn't really want to know what happened to some of the characters in the distant future.  I wanted Ondaatje to leave a little for my imagination.  But he didn't and that's his choice.  It certainly didn't ruin the book for me.<br />The writing in \\"The English Patient\\" is lyrical and beautiful, though spare.  Ondaatje is first and foremost a poet, and it shows.  This is a book that flows, that cascades, that washes over you with its words.<br />I first read \\"The English Patient\\" years ago and I haven't forgotten a single detail.  \\"The English Patient\\" is a book that captures your heart and never lets go.  It is a book that will haunt you with its beauty and with its sadness for many years to come, perhaps even for the rest of your life.  Yes, it's that good.	2002-04-12
US	38577070	R3K22Z177UWVC3	0140244883	6028222	Restoration: A Novel of Seventeenth-Century England (Tie-In Edition)	Books	5	13	13	N	N	An Absolute Romp	Set during 17th century England and the &quot;restoration&quot; of Charles II, Rose Tremain's novel, &quot;Restoration&quot; is the story of Robert Merivel, a man set on &quot;restoring&quot; himself.<br />Merivel is a walking contradiction.  He longs for money and power but admits that he is lazy about doing what needs to be done in order to obtain them.  In fact, Merivel even eschews his profession as a physician in favor of an easier life, one that did not entail so much hard work and long hours.  He actually marries the king's mistress though he is absolutely forbidden to touch her.  Complications arise when Merivel makes the mistake of falling in love with, who else...his own wife.<br />It was, however, Merivel's laziness that caused Charles II to look upon him with askance.  Feeling that Merivel still had potential, Charles forced him to practice his profession at a Quaker asylum, thus restoring Merivel to his status as a working man.<br />Although Merivel develops great compassion for the poor and the insane of the asylum, he does not completely transform himself.  He still desires power and wealth, but his self-control have at least taken a turn for the better.  This is the thrust of the book as I see it, the restoration of self-respect and self-sufficiency to Robert Merivel, although all of the other aspects of the book were interesting as well.<br />Details of 17th century England abound in this novel and they all serve to elevate the book beyond what it would have been had they not been included.  This is historical fiction with a comedic twist, and it is very, very good historical fiction.  At its heart, though, &quot;Restoration&quot; is the portrait of a man, a very flawed man, who, through the acknowledgement of his own flaws, perhaps, is restored.  In Robert Merivel, Rose Tremain has created a wonderful character:  a man who is flawed, but honest about those flaws, a man who is lazy but caring, vain but concerned about his own vanity.  It is easy tolove Robert Merivel and even easier to relate to him and to his contradictions.<br />It is Merivel's trials and contradictions, his loves and desires, that shape the course of this book.  His transformation from a self-centered, hedonistic fool to a serious and sensitive man is beautifully rendered.  &quot;Restoration,&quot; though a commentary on 17th century England, could very well be a commentary on the entire 21st century world as well.  As Charles II, himself, says, &quot;Even in an age in which we wisely practice the excellent art of oblivion, certain things remain.&quot;  It is the wise reader who will remember Charles' words...&quot;certain things remain&quot;...and proceed, like Merivel, to do something about the situation.	2002-04-10

April 1768.  He was executed only four short years later, but in those four years he accomplished more than many people do in a lifetime...a long lifetime.<br />King Christian was not your usual king; at least he was not a king in the manner in which one generally thinks of a king.  Christian considered the royal court to be his theatre, a theatre in which he had to know his lines or pay a heavy penalty.  A combination of innocence and madness, Christian really didn't understand what was going on in Denmark during his reign and what was going wrong.<br />Well, plenty was going wrong in Denmark at that time.  There were public executions and tortures; the Danish peasants were living in a state of perpetual penury; the Danish navy was locked in a deadly war with Algeria; Christian's half-brother was an invalid and Christian, himself, was barely lucid.  This was a court ripe for the preying and those prone to such things preyed, indeed.<br />&quot;The Royal Physician's Visit,&quot; by necessity, contains many diverse characters, but essentially, the story belongs to three:  Struensee, King Christian, and Caroline Mathilde, the young English girl brought to Denmark to be Christian's bride, for the express purpose of bearing the mad king an heir.  Perhaps there have been no other royals less fit to become parents than Christian and Caroline Mathilde.  Caroline had been cloistered for all of her thirteen years with no sense of mother or father, people or place.  Christian, who was the recipient of much psychological torment and physical beatings, had either been born mad or had been driven mad.<br />When Struensee arrives at this strange and confusing court, he views his mission as one of rescurer...of Denmark, not of Christian.  Christian may be mad, and he may remain mad for the rest of his days, but Struensee was a man of reason, a man who knew there was something very rotten in the state of Denmark.  After Christian happily turns over the keys of his kingdom to Struensee, the quiet German doctor proceeds to issue 623 decrees in only two short years.  Although this may be viewed as opportunistic by some, Struensee's decrees did pull Denmark back from the brink of destruction and into the light of rationalism.<br />Like most of us, however, Struensee had a fatal flaw and it involved Caroline Mathilde.  When the two fall in love, they incur the wrath of the dowager queen and a man called Guldberg.  Struensee and Caroline Mathilde give the dowager queen and Guldberg the chance both have been waiting for and, inevitably, on 28. April 1772, the guillotine fell.  Struensee, however, through his daughter, may have had the very last laugh and he may, in some ways, be laughing still.<br />&quot;The Royal Physician's Visit&quot; is a remarkable book that blends history and impeccable storytelling skills.  We learn much about Denmark during the reign of Christian VII and we are thoroughly engrossed in the story of Struensee while we are learning.  Enquist's prose is wonderful:  beautiful, precise and absolutely on key.  This is, quite simply, a perfect book for anyone who loves a great story set against a rich, historical background.  It is, without a doubt, one of the best books I've read this year.	2002-04-10

Or almost just as much.  And, the opening chapters were quite engrossing and enjoyable.  After that, however, the book just seemed to fall apart, or to put it more correctly, it never came together.<br />&quot;Swift as Desire&quot; is Laura Esquivel's autobiographical tribute to her own father and perhaps this is a part of the problem with the book.  Perhaps Esquivel just couldn't distance herself enough from her subject matter to manipulate it from &quot;life&quot; into &quot;literature.&quot;<br />&quot;Swift as Desire&quot; is a romance based on Esquivel's  father's work as a telegraph operator in Mexico.  Apparently, being a telegraph operator was the perfect job for Jubilo since he was born with the gift of knowing just what others wanted to express.  In other words, he could &quot;read&quot; the intention behind their words and, he knew which words to choose to best convey those intentions.<br />A character such as Jubilo does give Esquivel the opportunity to insert much comedy into her narrative.  For me, one of the best examples comes when Jubilo acts as interpreter between his warring Mayan grandmother and Spanish-speaking mother.  Jubilo was careful to soften what these ladies said to each other and the effect is often quite amusing.<br />When Jubilo discovers the telegraph, he knows he has come into his own.  The way he saw it, only he would know what people wanted to say to each other so, therefore, he could revise what was being said for maximum impact...and maximum joy, of course.  Jubilo, it should be noted, didn't have a malicious bone in his body.<br />Enter Lucha.  Lucha is the proud and beautiful daughter of a wealthy Mexican family.  Jubilo and Lucha fall deeply in love and soon marry and, even though Mexican women of that era did not, as a general rule, work outside their home, Lucha takes a job as secretary at the telegraph companywhere Jubilo works.  Jubilo and Lucha find that this job rewards them in two ways.  First, they can flirt with each other all day long and, at times, even engage in romantic intimacies, and second, the extra income helps Lucha to live with some of the luxuries she had become accustomed to in the home of her parents.<br />If all of this seems idyllic, it isn't.  Don Pedro, Jubilo's and Lucha's boss is around to spoil things when he begins to desire Lucha for himself.<br />I have never been a fan of flashbacks, unless they are done extremely well and this is a book told in flashbacks.  The narrator is Lluvia (and why should a man as apparently joyful as Jubilo give his daughter such a depressing name?), the daughter of Jubilo and Lucha.  By the time Lluvia gets around to telling the story of her parents, Lucha is dead and Jubilo is suffering from both Parkinson's disease and blindness.  To ease his sufferings, Lluvia brings him a telegraph, something she hopes will help him communicate with others.<br />The telegraph is one of the book's strong points as well as one of its weakest.  When Jubilo is young, the telegraph is a metaphor for desire and the communication of desire, and, as such, it works well.  However, in the later section of the book, Esquivel &quot;explains&quot; so much of what she is attempting to do that it really got tiresome.  This is a sweet and rather frothy little tale and it needed a much lighter touch than Esquivel seems willing to give it.<br />The characters also suffer in this book.  In &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; I thought every female character was extremely well-developed and unique.  In &quot;Swift as Desire,&quot; however, only Jubilo and Lucha are developed and come off as real and believable.  Don Pedro is the quintessential villainous caricature and Lluvia is so thinly developed she is almost ghostlike.<br />Esquivel obviously meant this book to be a tribute to a loving (and loved) father.  I feel bad for her that it didn'tcome out better than it did, for it did have potential.  Writing students are warned, time and time again, to be very wary of autobiographical material.  Perhaps, it is a warning Esquivel should have taken more to heart.<br />&quot;Swift as Desire&quot; isn't a bad way to spend an evening, but it certainly doesn't measure up to &quot;Like Water for Chocolate.&quot;  In fact, it doesn't even come close.	2002-04-09
US	38577070	R170X870MLSE97	0399146431	745329531	The Bonesetter's Daughter	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Mothers and Daughters, Love and Loss	Amy Tan is an excellent writer, though she does seem to need to write about the same thing time and time again from every perspective, i.e., the relationship between first-generation Chinese daughters and their immigrant mothers.  While \\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" is an excellent book and quite well-written, I, for one, wish Tan would choose another subject for her next book.  She's talented and I'm curious.<br />\\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" is the story of Ruth Young and her mother, LuLing, a woman who is in the first stages of Alzheimer's.  The book is written in a frame, with the opening and closing chapters belonging to Ruth, the middle to LuLing.<br />Ruth, who has the unenviable job of ghostwriting self-help books that probably cause more harm than good, is cleaning her mother's duplex when she makes what will prove to be a very important and life-affirming discovery:  a packet of papers, divided into two groups and written in Chinese calligraphy that detail LuLing's life in China as well as the life of her mother, a woman LuLing knew as \\"Precious Auntie.\\"<br />The title of this book refers to Ruth's grandmother, the daughter of a famous bonesetter from Xian Xin, the family village.  With the help of a translator, Ruth discovers that her family had been bonesetters for nine hundred years, something of which they were very proud.<br />LuLing's mother suffered greatly early in life; both her fiance and her father were killed.  Distraught and pregnant, \\"Precious Auntie\\" decided to take her own life.  She failed in the attempt, but succeeded in scarring her face both terribly and permanently.  The family that were to become her in-laws took her into their own home where LuLing was claimed by \\"Precious Auntie's\\" dead finace's aunt, with \\"Precious Auntie\\" being relegated to the role of nursemaid.<br />In what seems an extremely cruel twist of fate, LuLing learns about her parentage only when \\"Precious Auntie\\" stages a rather spectacular suicide rather than see her daughter married to the wrong man.  After this, follows a marriage and a murder, a religious conversion and LuLing's emigration to California where she finds love, or what passes for love, only to be left alone...again.  All of this may sound rather melodramatic.  If it does, you obviously haven't read Amy Tan for melodrama is not among her devices.  Her books tend to be quiet revelations that pull us in because we care about the characters involved, not because of the events themselves.<br />Ruth's life hasn't made much more sense than has LuLing's, despite her struggle to understand and come to grips with both fear and loss.  As Ruth pieces together the puzzle of her mother's life, she pieces together the puzzle of her own as well.  Like most daughters, once they reach adulthood, Ruth realizes all too late how easy it would have been to be the daughter her mother wanted and give her mother the happiness she both craved and deserved.<br />\\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" is a rich, complex and multi-layered novel.  It is filled with small details that make it come alive and the characters are fully-realized, lovable and believable.  Even the more fantastic parts of LuLing's narrative are believable.  Tan writes very clearly and very well.<br />I didn't care for the ending of \\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" and I think some other readers will find it a little jarring as well.  It just didn't seem to fit the character of the book.  This is, after all, a book about love and loss.<br />I do enjoy Amy Tan's writing.  It's mannerly, in a quiet sort of way; there is absolutely nothing in it to offend.  It is because of her high quality writing that I keep coming back to her books despite the fact that I wish she would write about something else other than the dynamics of mother-daughter relationships and the loss inherent in them.  That, however, is a quibble.  \\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" is a lovely book about lovely people who are stuggling make sense of their lives and the worldaround them.  Despite its recycled theme, \\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" is still going to be better than ninety percent of what you'll probably read in a lifetime.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone.	2002-04-09

Complications arise for Stevens when he finds he must replace two members of the staff at Darlington...a housekeeper and an under-butler.<br />...<br />\\"The Remains of theDay\\" is a masterpiece in many ways, not the least of which is subtlety.  We know Stevens feels pain, we know he feels love, and we can read, in between Ishiguro's perfectly chosen, precise words, Stevens' struggle to express that which he feels so deeply.<br />...<br />If you haven't read \\"The Remains of the Day\\" or seen the movie, you may get the idea that this is a very depressing book, indeed.  It is not.  It is quiet and understated and ultimately, profoundly sad, but it does its moments of humor, though they, too, are masterpieces of understatement.  One of the most typical involves a Chinese figure that causes a minor battle of wills between Stevens and Miss Kenton.<br />All of Kazuo Ishiguro's books raise many more questions than they answer (a mark of a truly superlative book) and \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is no exception.  Are Stevens and Miss Kenton merely victims of their occupations and the times in which they live or does Stevens possess some flaw of character, a flaw that permits him to be the perfect English butler but a less than perfect man?  Each reader will have to draw his or her own conclusions, but I can guarantee one thing:  no one who reads this book will come away from it unchanged.  Indeed, most will come away heartbroken.	2002-04-09

Frightened and bloodstained, Eliska makes her way to what she believes is an abandoned castle and finds that it is not abandoned at all...there is a baby inside.  The castle is the ancestral family home of the Blansky family and, although it is not entirely deserted (bread is rising on the table and milk is warming on the stove), it does contain many secrets.<br />Only a few hours later, Jiri, an idealistic young communist makes his appearance in the house and, shortly after Jiri, we meet Count Michael Blansky, the castle's owner.  Next to seek refuge in the house is Slavomir, Jiri's Red Army comrade.  Slavomir is just as dedicated to the cause of communism as is Jiri, although he is driven primarily by a need for power.<br />Growing unrest (and the false charge of being a Nazi sympathizer) causes Count Blansky to feel the need to leave the house (and Comenia) and he soon flees to England and seeks asylum with his son, Pavel.  Blansky's neighbor, Frantisek Konecny, however, chooses to remain and his life will become entwined with the lives of those now living in the Blansky castle.<br />Paton Walsh certainly puts her remaining characters through much trauma:  forced labor, torture, imprisonment, betrayals, terror, corruption of all kinds and even forced psychiatric hospitalization.<br />Although I didn't think this book quite came together as it should have, it does contain some lovely set pieces.  The saddest occurs when Count Michael, who has been living near the border of Comenia, manages to gain surreptitious entrance to that country with his granddaughter, Kate, in an effort to have one last look at Libohrad, his ancestral home.  What he finds instead is heartbreaking and it involves Eliska, Jiri and the baby found in the castle, now a young woman named Nadezda.<br />The characters' stories do intertwine very nicely and Paton Walsh does a good job in bringing philosophical questions to her narrative without sounding heavy-handed.  But the book does seem to change its focus near the middle, or just before.  What began as a marvelous book of ideas and of the effects of communism on a disparate group of characters, becomes a thriller instead.  It was much better as a book of ideas.<br />The ending of the book also presented problems for me.  I found the rather happy ending experienced by most of the characters to be too pat, too hopeful and almost too \\"sweet.\\"  I would have preferred to read about a more realistic portrayal of communism and circumstances in eastern Europe today.<br />\\"A Desert in Bohemia\\" isn't a bad book at all, but neither is it an outstanding one, or even one above the ordinary.  It has some lovely set pieces and some memorable scenes.  It is well-written, but for me, at least, it just didn't come together.  It just didn't gel.	2002-04-09

After making her startling announcement, Kate then relates a rather gruesome story that happened in the Dublin house of her grandmother many years ago, when Kate, herself, was a child.<br />Although the above is certainly an engrossing way to open a novel, it really doen't have anything to do with the story that follows, except for introducing Catherine Allen, who, as a grown woman, will be our narrator through his dark and Gothic tale.<br />As a passionate, independent woman who harbors far more than her share of both secrets and pain, Catherine Allen looks much as we would expect her to look, possessing dark, unruly hair and dark eyes that unnerve even the most strong-willed.<br />Catherine's sharer-of-secrets and co-conspirtor is her brother, Rob, who seems, even at his young age, to be something of a dandy and, perhaps, more affected by the strange goings-on at the decaying estate the two call home than is Catherine.<br />If Rob and Cathy aren't your typical children, even in a drafy English country manor house, it might have something to do with the fact that their parents are not your typical parents.  Their mother (who was perhaps the wisest of them all, though definitely not the most kind-hearted), bolted from the strangeness of it all to live a bohemian life in the south of France.  Their father made his escape through insanity and died (under suspicious circumstances) in an asylum ironicaly called, the Sancturary.<br />If Rob and Cathy have apparently learned much from their parents, though and they harbor many dark secrets of their own.  For most of us, these secrets heat up the storyline while giving us the shivers.  Although I found this book both haunting and eerie, I think some readers might find the storyline a bit too melodramatic and over-the-top.<br />While I thought Catherine was a good narrator, her often heartless approach to things that would have broken my heart made me dislike her and, as a consequence, I lost quite a bit of sympathy for her.  Dunmore's writing is so life-like and so riveting, that we can't help but be pulled in when Catherine describes scenes that, at their mildest, could only be described as &quot;harrowing.&quot;<br />The very best thing about this novel though, is not the characters or the plot, it is Dunmore's beautiful prose and her wonderful sense of place.  She certainly has a way with description; I could have enjoyed this book for the gorgeous prose alone, though I doubt that that would be enough to please most readers.<br />While the book does have a tendency to slip into melodrama at times, as far as the plot is concerned, it is really still believable.  By the time we reach the last third of the novel, most of the characters are &quot;gone,&quot; and only Catherine remains.  I didn't care for this part of the novel quite as much as the preceding pages.  While the first two-thirds of the book had a dusty, claustrophobic feel, just perfect for the subject matter, the last third seemed more open, more expansive...and far less moody.<br />The close of the novel is something of a twist, and a modern one at that.  Personally, I didn't care for it but I know other readers may feel differently.  It wasn't bad, I simply didn't find it at all believable.<br />If you liked &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and the characters of Catherine and Heathcliff, you will probably enjoy &quot;A Spell of Winter.&quot;  It has the same moody, claustrophobic feel (at least through most of the story) and the same unrelenting darkness.  If you simply enjoy a good, old-fashioned tale, complete with lush settings written in beautiful and lyrical prose, you would also probably enjoy this book.  If, however, you require stark realism and total believability, better skip this one.	2002-04-08

Yet, part of the miracle of this book is that every page remains as fresh and as sparkling as the one before (and this is a long book, my edition has more than 1000 pages).  Quite an accomplishment!<br />\\"Aztec\\" is \\"the\\" story of the Aztec civilization of Mexico, told at the very height of its magnificence and glory.  The protagonist of the book, Mixtli, is a person you are guaranteed to never forget but will surely come to miss.  Although Mixtli wasn't born to a high station in the Aztec world, he manages to rise above himself, becomming first a scribe, then a warrior, then a traveling merchant.  As the latter, he travels over all of Mexico, then called The One World, exploring jungles, mountain peaks, deserts, beaches.  And, he makes a fortune in the doing.  Eventualy, Mixtli is elevated to knighthood and the nobility, both stations he well deserves.<br />\\"Aztec\\" is, by turns, gruesome, suspenseful, sexual, adventurous, erotic, heroic and comic and everything is done on epic proportion.  It has to be since Mixtli is not a man to do anything by halves, or to leave a task undone.  He seems possessed by an unquenchable thirst for new adventures and new horizens and, luckily, we can travel along with him without risking the consequences Mixtli so often had to face.<br />Through the pages of \\"Aztec\\" we witness, along with Mixtli, the gruesome Wars of Flowers, the nomadic life of the Dog People of the desert, the dignity of the Cloud People who live in the mountains, the one-time spendour of the Mayan jungles of the Yucatan, and the glory of Tenochtitlan, the capital city of the Aztecs.<br />All is not glory and splendour in this book, however, and \\"Aztec\\" is certainly not for the faint-hearted or the squeamish.  Some of the scenes, especially the sacrificial scenes, are so gruesome and blood-drenched that it can be difficult to read every word.  And the book is, at times, quite tragic, for Mixtli, himself, does not escape his share of blood and gore.<br />Some readers have complained about the violence and sex included in this book.  I know much violence and sex is simply gratuitous these days, but it certainly isn't in \\"Aztec.\\"  Sex and violence were simply part and parcel of the Aztec culture; had Jennings failed to include it, his book would have read like some watered-down, barely palpable version of the \\"real thing.\\"  The Aztecs did everything on a grand scale; if you require drawing-room manners in your reading, you'd best skip this book and read Jane Austen instead.<br />Lest you think Jennings forgot the other side of the coin, i.e., the Spanish point of view, he most certainly did not.  At the height of his career (and at the pinnacle of Aztec civilization), Mixtli is sent by Motecuzoma to \\"welcome\\" the strangers who have arrived in The One World.  Wondering if they are gods or mortals, Mixtli thus comes to meet Cortes and his band of conquistadors...the very persons who will destroy the Aztec civilization and very nearly wipe its memory from the face of the earth.  Still, even in times as tumultuous as these, Mixtli has one more heroic deed waiting for him to accomplish.<br />I've read that it took Jennings twelve years to write \\"Aztec.\\"  I can well see why.  The book is filled with detail about healing, about cooking, about sacrifice, about love, about anything and everything that made up the world of the Aztecs.  Although I certainly wouldn't have wanted to be a member of that world (I'm far too peace-loving for that), finishing <BR>\\"Aztec\\" does cause me to miss the vicarious experience of it.<br />If you like your literature uncensored and filled to the brim with life, in all its glory and all its tragedy, then \\"Aztec\\" might be the book for you.  Just be prepared for a dizzyingly wild and wonderful ride like none you've ever experienced before.	2002-04-07

By creating the Kulturbunds, which only Jews could join and attend, the Nazis hoped to cover up their inhumane treatment of this ethnic group.<br />Both of Martin Goldsmith's parents were talented, highly trained musicians.  His father, Gunther Goldschmidt, was the son of Alex Goldschmidt, a prosperous clothing store owner in Oldenburg, Germany and a World War I veteran.  Gunther, a budding flutist, was eventually forced to leave music school simply because he was a Jew.<br />Goldsmith's mother, Rosemarie, was a violinist who had been trained by her own father, the director and owner of the Gumpert Conservatory of Music in Dusseldorf, Germany.  Both Gunther and Rosemarie considered themselves Germans first and Jews second, and both were happy to be accepted into the Kulturbund...at first.<br />On 9. November 1938, the eve of the horrible \\"Kristallnacht,\\" the Jewish community in Germany was forced to take another look at their comfortable Kulturbunds, for it is on that date that the Nazis chose to burn synagogues and Jewish places of business.  When Alex Goldschmidt marched down the streets of Oldenburg with other young Jewish men in protest, he was rapidly taken to prison.  The Nazis, however, attempted to \\"smooth things over\\" by telling the Jews they were only \\"protecting\\" them from other, angry German citizens.<br />In 1941, when the Nazis closed the Kulturbunds, Gunther and Rosemarie escaped to freedom in New York City.  Other patrons and musicians, however, did not make it to safety.  As a memorial plaque at one Kulterbund reads, \\"Almost all of those who worked here were murdered in concentration camps.\\"<br />The Goldschmidts,now the Goldsmiths, eventually settled in Ohio where Martin Goldsmith was born in 1952.  Although his father gave up music forever, his mother later became a member of the Cleveland Orchestra.<br />\\"The Inextinguishable Symphony\\" is a book about Nazi Germany that gives us another view of the era and of the Holocaust.  Rather than focusing on the camps as excellent authors such as Elie Wiesel and Primo Levi have done, Goldsmith focuses on the plight of Jews who managed to remain out of the camps, yet lived very restricted lives.  <br />This book is a fascinating account and one that is extremely well-written.  I would recommend it highly to anyone who is interested in this period in world history.	2002-04-07
US	38577070	ROCCS4I5DNPRU	0345443020	981903971	Perdido Street Station (Bas-Lag)	Books	5	22	28	N	N	Dark, Complex, Fantastic	Although I don't usually like fantasy that reads more like science fiction, China Mieville's \\"Perdido Street Station\\" is so original, so inventive and so complex that I had to read it, and I'm certainly glad I did.<br />\\"Perdido Street Station\\" takes place in New Crobuzon, a huge, sprawling, polluted city-state quite reminiscent of the very worst of London.  New Crobuzon is home to, not only humans, but a variety of mutants, aliens, modified criminals and xenians...a particular species of humanoid that is part bird, part insect, part cactus, etc.  In New Crobuzon, humans and humanoids, mutants and aliens, live and work and socialize alongside one another.  In fact, the origin of the xenians is never made known, it is simply accepted as the way the world is today.  The fact that Mieville does not tell us everything about everything in this novel is a plus, not a minus.  In a novel such a \\"Perdido Street Station\\" one's imagination needs free rein to create along with the book's creator.  Mieville has generously given us this free rein.<BR> <BR>The protagonist of the book is rebel scientist Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin who is assigned the task of restoring flight to a criminal garuda bird-man, Yagharek.  Isaac's lover, Lin, is a xenian, or, more specifically a khepri sculptor.  This jeopardizes Issac and his career in academia for two reasons:  humans are not allowed to enter into affairs with xenians, and, Issac is not the only one with an assignment, Lin has one herself, involving New Crobuzon's most notorious gangster.  Both Isaac's assignment and Lin's have potentially disatrous results, on the personal level and on a more cosmic level as well.  And both threaten the existence of New Crobuzon.<br />Because this is fantasy (weird fantasy, but fantasy nevertheless), the brand of science practiced by Isaac is not science as we know it, but something more akin to alchemy and magic.  The world of New Crobuzon simply overflows with marvelously-realized characters; for Mieville, obviously, anything and everything, goes.  Yet, odd as New Crobuzon is, there is something strangely familiar about it as well.  The social ills, the corruption, the love, the hate, the friendships are what we, ourselves, experience in our day-to-day life.  New Crobuzon, however, is a far darker place than the places we usually inhabit.  In fact, the tone of this novel is so dark that, despite its modern elements, there is a vaguely Gothic feel about it.<br />It's not easy to write about \\"Perdido Street Station\\" without giving away some of the plot and I certainly don't want to do that.  This book is so good that one should discover the plot within its pages and not in a review.  This is also a book that just may possibly be \\"too much of a good thing.\\"  Everything seems to abound in New Crobuzon--monsters, demons, slakemoths, frog people, the spider-like Weaver, the scarab-headed khepri.  Does Mieville have anything left over?<br />As good as \\"Perdido Street Station\\" is, I think some readers are going to be disappointed with its ending.  I found it to be powerful, but after such a complex plot, I think some readers might be expecting something different.  For those who are disappointed, my advice would be to let the novel simmer in your imagination for awhile, absorb it.  Then I think the ending might make more sense.<br />It takes a very special book to cause me to become absorbed in science fiction.  \\"Perdido Street Station\\" is exactly that kind of book.  Even if science fiction or fantasy is not for you, I think you should give this book a chance.  You just might be surprised.	2002-04-07
US	38577070	R307KKU8LDRRMF	0679722661	156744649	An Artist of the Floating World	Books	5	16	17	N	N	Delicate and Beautiful	I've read all of Kazuo Ishiguro's books, and, while &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; is my very favorite, this small book comes in a close second.  It is delicate in its theme and narrative, yet its effects are quite lasting.<br />&quot;An Artist of the Floating World&quot; takes place in 1948 in a quiet town in Japan.  The protagonist, Masuji Ono, once a moderately famous artist, enjoys spending his days mopping his tatami and working in his garden, although the highlight of his life are the visits from his grandson, Ichiro.  As Ono enjoys his retirement from painting, he also takes the opportunity to look back on his life and reflect upon its meaning.<br />Ono's memories of the past are many; he has had a long journey from young, bohemian art student to retired, successful artist.  In the 1930s, Ono took great pleasure in visiting the &quot;red light&quot; districts of Japan, but after his marriage, he settled down and devoted himself to his family and his painting.<br />Ono and his late wife had three children.  Sadly, his only son died during the war.  His loss still affects Ono greatly, as it always will.  His elder daughter, Setsuko, the mother of Ichiro, is, from all appearances, happily married.  His younger daughter, Neriko, has not been quite as successful where marriage is concerned.  Her first marriage negotiations were broken off and she is now involved in a second attempt.<br />In one of the most intriguing sections of this book, Ishiguro describes the marriage negotiations that used to be routine in Japan.  These negotiations are called a &quot;miai&quot; and involve what resembles a British high tea.  First, the parents must be matched, as the two families involved must be within the same social and economic class.  Once it has been decided that the parents of both the prospective bride and the prospective groom are a &quot;fit,&quot; the couple is allowed to meet for the very first time.  Only after everyone has given their stamp of approval can the actual wedding finally take place.  Unfortunately, Neriko's first marriage negotiation failed when she was considered to be of a lower social class than her prospective bridegroom.  Ono, who has a darker past than one might initially assume, is worried that it may possibly come to light and harm Neriko's marriage negotiations, causing them to fail for a second time.<br />Ono's musings take us back to World War II Japan, a time when all Japanese felt extremely patriotic and a time when any &quot;wrong&quot; action could cause one to be labelled a traitor.  Ono, through his art, endeavored to help the cause of Japan in the war.  Now, Ono, who lost his both his son and his wife in the war, feels he must reflect on his actions and decide what the consequences of them really were.  Does he require forgiveness?  If so, from whom?  Is he being silly and pompous in believing that his art actually made a difference?  Or is he thoughtful and reflective; a man who wants and needs to take responsibility for his actions?  I really don't know and Ishiguro doesn't tell us, much to this book's credit.  Sometimes, the things that aren't written are more important that the things that are written.  As we get to know Ono, we come to experience imperial Japan.  It is a heady and exotic experience and one I certainly wouldn't have wanted to miss.<br />Ishiguro, in my opinion, is one of the top five greatest living authors and a master of understatement and subtlety.  Nowhere is this more evident that in his glorious book, &quot;The Remains of the Day.&quot;  &quot;An Artist of the Floating World,&quot; however, has charms of its own.  Ishiguro's prose is precise, with every word carefully chosen.  In his writing, Ishiguro seems to resemble the miai, the very epitome of politeness and respect.<br />&quot;An Artist of the Floating World&quot; is a beautiful book and one that leaves a deep impression without seeming to do much at all.	2002-04-06
US	38577070	R1XWF4RRSM5IPJ	0192142674	527848270	The Oxford Book of Sonnets	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Alive and Well	Although most people would probably argue that the sonnet is \\"dead,\\" this anthology proves that it is alive and well and thriving.  Yes, the sonnet is more than 450 years old now, but, as a poetic form, it's definitely a survivor.<br />\\"The Oxford Book of Sonnets\\" contains only 328 sonnets, so cannot be said to be a comprehensive study.  In his introduction, John Fuller tells us that considerations of expense limited him to including only one sonnet per represented poet still under copyright, with the exception of three (Robinson, Millay and Auden).  This fact alone is definitely going to detract from the book, for I certainly would have liked to have had more of Robert Graves, Dylan Thomas, Richard Wilbur, and others.<br />On the other hand, Fuller does give us eight of Shakespeare's sonnets, eight of Wordsworth's, seven of Milton's, five of Donne's and five of Keat's, three of Yeat's, though only two of George Herbert's.<br />Female writers, usually forgotten or neglected, are well represented in this book, in particular, the wonderful Christina Rossetti.  \\"The Oxford Book of Sonnets\\" contains the full text (14 sonnets) of Rossetti's, Monna Innominata, A Sonnet of Sonnets as well it should.  This is a gorgeous work.<br />I'm something of a purist; I like octets, sestets, quatrains and couplets, so I was a little dismayed at some of the more \\"modern\\" selections included here, but that's my problem, not Fuller's and not this book's.  Some of the works included did seem a little fanciful though.  Take Leigh Hunt's Iterating Sonnet.  Each of its 14 lines ends with the words, \\"United States.\\"  It was a little too much for me, at least.<br />What I liked most about \\"The Oxford Book of Sonnets\\" was its history of the sonnet as a poetic form.  No foreign language sonnets have been included in this book; Fuller sticks to English sonnets here.  And he traces the sonnets from the 16th century to the present day.<br />Purist though I am, I did enjoy Richard Murphy's, BeehiveCell and Jamie McKendrick's, A Shortened History in Pictures.  In the latter work, each of the 14 lines evokes a famous painting...very inventive.<br />This is an anthology and, like all anthologies it cannot be all-inclusive.  I am sure other readers will miss some of their favorite sonnets, just as I did.  But, we can always buy a volume of our favorite poet to remedy that.  Overall, I found this little volume to be quite instructive and informative and I liked the small size as well.  It's easy to slip into my purse to read on the bus, on the train, on a plane, anywhere, really.<br />Those who can't bear anything but Shakespeare would best skip this book; they'll only come away annoyed.  But those who are looking for something enjoyable and informative may find what they're looking for in \\"The Oxford Book of Sonnets.\\"  I did.	2002-04-06

Maybe that's not fair to the book; I haven't decided yet.  I do know that when I bought this book, I expected to be plunged into the world of Mao Tse-tung's China, not France, but &quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress&quot; is about as French, in its attitude and outlook, as a book can get.  This really shouldn't be surprising since the book's author, Dai Sijie, has lived in France for twenty years now.<br />&quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress,&quot; despite being very, very French in outlook, does take place<BR>in the communist China of Mao Tse-tung.  It concerns Mao's re-education plan for intellectuals and perceived &quot;enemies&quot; of the people.<br />The book's opening scene is perhaps its very best.  The unnamed narrator and a boy called Luo arrive at the mountain village where they are to be &quot;reeducated.&quot;  The narrator, who is playing a violin, immediately angers the peasant in charge of the camp, who then proceeds to tear the violin from the narrator's hands.  Luo, however, saves the day (and the violin), when he grabs it and begins playing a piece called, he tells the peasant, &quot;Mozart is Thinking of Chairman Mao.&quot;  The peasant smiles, grateful that these two errant boys are learning their lesson so quickly!<br />As we read on we find that Luo's father, a famous dentist, had spoken openly against Chairman Mao, something the narrator calls, &quot;beyond belief, an unpardonable, insane crime....&quot;  The narrator's parents were almost as bad; they were doctors who had enjoyed a good reputation and income.  Because of the &quot;crimes&quot; of their parents, both boys were deemed &quot;tainted&quot; and sent to be reeducated.<br />Life in this mountainous village really isn't about reeducation, it's about subjecting oneself to Mao and the party.  And, the more one needs to be reeducated, the harsher is his work.  Luo and the narrator aregiven one of the worst (and most humiliating) jobs of all:  carrying buckets of excrement to be emptied.  They find almost nothing to nourish and sustain them in this harsh and unforgiving environment until they meet and become friends with the daughter of the local tailor...the Little Seamstress of the title (who is, sadly, never named).<br />Enter Four-Eyes, a friend of Luo and the narrator who hails from their own home village.  Four-Eyes, whose mother is a poet, has naturally become an &quot;enemy&quot; of the people.  But Four-Eyes is also the keeper of a veritable treasure house of secrets in the camp.  He has, hidden away in a old, leather suitcase, copies of Western books, the very books that &quot;the people&quot; have been expressly forbidden to read.  When Four-Eyes shows his friends a volume of Balzac, magic happens and the lives of the boys take a 180 degree turn for the better.  (It is very interesting to note that most of the books Four-Eyes has secreted in his suitcase have been written by French authors.)<br />Luo, who has become enamoured of the Little Seamstress, attempts to both impress and &quot;civilize&quot; her by reading her Balzac.  Let's just say that both Luo and the Little Seamstress enjoy success beyond their wildest dreams.  The Little Seamstress feels &quot;carried away in a dream,&quot; while Luo feels he is &quot;falling headlong into a story of awakening desire, passion...love...all the subjects that had...been hidden....&quot;<br />While this book is quite lovely and definitely for adults (the subject matter is probably too sophisticated for most younger people), there is a very juvenile air to the story.  The characters are, after all, juveniles themselves, mere adolescents.<br />Sijie is primarily a filmmaker, so I suppose references to film are inevitable in the book, however, I found them tremendously off-putting, almost to the point of ruining the book's delicate and ephemeral qualities.  Describing his characters, Sijie says one &quot;could have walked straight out of a bad comic film.&quot;  Another has &quot;arms as thick as Sylvester Stallone's.&quot;  Not what I expected in a book set in Mao's China.<br />Luo's storytelling ability wins the boys the opportunity to visit the local movie theatre in a nearby town.  After seeing the films, they stage &quot;oral cinema shows&quot; for the villagers.  I would have liked the book far more had the references to cinema been left out.  I felt they were unnecessary and definitely detracted from the book's charm.  They are not badly written, though, and other readers may like them.<br />This is a relatively short book and it is quite episodic rather than being a conventional novel.  Its message (and it does seem to have a message) seems to be two-fold:  literature is life-affirming and, be careful what you wish for, for you just might get it.<br />While &quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress&quot; wasn't one of my favorite books, it is entertaining and quite beautiful in spots.  I think most people who read it will definitely enjoy it.	2002-04-06
US	38577070	R1R806G6KUWZMX	0141002026	342087812	The Burning of Bridget Cleary: A True Story	Books	2	37	47	N	N	Lost Its Focus	I don't usually read non-fiction (unless it is biography) but a friend recently gave me this book and it looked intriguing.  In March 1895, in County Tipperary, Ireland, a sick wife, Bridget Cleary, was burned to death by her husband, aunt and four cousins, who then buried her body in a makeshift grave.  This book, written by Angela Bourke, an expert in Irish oral tradition, details what probably caused those close to her to suspect that Bridget Cleary was a changeling and also what happened to her husband, Michael, in the aftermath of her burning.<br />According to Michael Cleary and the other relatives responsible for Bridget's death, Bridget Cleary became ill with bronchitis and was then abducted by fairies who left behind only a changeling.  This came after Michael Cleary had sought genuine medical help for his wife, then, convinced that Bridget had \\"gone with the fairies,\\" conspired with a fairy doctor instead.<br />Bridget Cleary, at 26, was definitely not the average 19th century peasant wife.  She was more independent that most women of her time, both in her outlook and in her finances (she was a successful dressmaker), she was more educated, she was quite attractive and she spoke her mind.  But probably most damning, at least in Bridget's day, was the fact that although she had been married for eight years, she was childless.<br />To put it all in a nutshell, Bourke, who originally began this book as a part of her doctoral dissertation, believes that Bridget was simply too \\"strong-willed\\" to fit in with 19th century Tipperary society.  The local traditions condoned the burning of witches and fairies and so, what better way to \\"control\\" Bridget than to burn her?  Just get her out of the way.<br />I can buy the reasoning above.  Small, patriarchal, clannish villages were certainly not above taking matters into their own hands, and fairy lore has always been part and parcel of Irish history, but Bourke lost my vote of confidence when she went on to suggest that Bridget Cleary had had an affair with her neighbor, Michael Simpson.  While there is evidence to suggest that Bridget Cleary would have been intelligent enough and talented enough and independent enough and out-spoken enough to pose a threat to her small community, there is absolutely no evidence (at least none presented by Bourke) to suggest that Cleary had an affair with Simpson.  (Bourke suggests that Bridget found Simpson \\"more attractive\\" than her own husband.  I contend that a woman as intelligent as Bridget Cleary apparently was, would not have committed adultery on such shallow grounds.)  What the \\"Simpson affair\\" does do, however, is absolve Michael Cleary of much of the blame for Bridget's death.<br />Whether Bridget Cleary had an affair of not, Bourke comes to the conclusion that Michael Cleary felt completely justified in the burning of his wife.  The British, however, were not convinced and neither am I.  By all accounts, Bridget was tortured and Bourke's recounting of this torture provide some of the most vivid writing in what is essentially a very dry and prosaic book.  Michael Cleary, by the way, was found guilty of murder and received a 20-year sentence. <br />As long as Bourke remains focused on Bridget Cleary, this book is rather compelling reading.  It is when she veers off and begins to talk about Anglo-Irish politics, home rule and the Marquess of Queensberry that she become quite tedious.  A PhD dissertation is one thing; a compelling book of non-fiction is another.  I think Bourke made the mistake of attempting to combine the two and it simply didn't make for a very good combination.<br />The Cleary case was a widely-publicized one and Bourke gives in to the rather fanciful idea that it even helped to defeat home rule for Ireland.  After all, writes Bourke, a population as given to superstition and folklore as the Irish could certainly not be allowed to govern itself.  To bolster her argument, Bourke notes that the libel suit against the Marquess of Queensberry (who had accused Oscar Wilde of homosexuality), was going on in London at the same time as Michael Cleary was being accused of murder in County Tipperary.  The Irish, Bourke points out, were seen, in the light of these two cases, as superstitious savages who were homosexual as well.  I can't buy this argument for the defeat of home rule just as I can't buy the argument that Bridget Cleary had had an affair with Michael Simpson.  Both \\"reasons\\" are too \\"pat,\\" too convenient.  And Bourke simply doesn't explore the other side of the coin.  I have no doubt that Bourke attempted to be precise and factual, however.  \\"The Burning of Bridget Cleary\\" includes 25 pages of notes taken from court transcripts, newspaper accounts and prison records.<br />This book is titled, \\"The Burning of Bridget Cleary,\\" and Bridget's story does make for some very interesting reading.  The details of Irish peasant life and the fairy culture that was so ingrained in late 19th century Ireland are interesting and do help us to understand Bridget and her community.  But when the book goes off on political and social tangents, it simply loses its focus and, I suspect, loses most of its readers.  I wanted to read a compelling book about a mysterious \\"real-life\\" crime, not a treatise on Anglo-Irish politics.  Had it been a political book I wanted, I would have chosen one far more comprehensive.<br />Bridget Cleary was undoubtedly a woman who deserved to live, a woman who could have contributed much to her community.  Her death was a tragedy and it deserves a sensitive and meaningful exploration.  As I said above, as long as Bourke stuck to the subject of Bridget Cleary, this book was good reading matter.  It is when she lost her focus and veered off into politics and social mores that the book became so much less than it could have been.<br />Bridget Cleary was a fascinating woman and her murder deserves further investigation and remembrance.  I just wouldn't recommend this bookas a vehicle of either.	2002-04-06
US	38577070	R3MNFKWJJGUD4M	0452283868	921712930	Sula (Oprah's Book Club)	Books	5	81	88	N	N	Difficult, but Well Worth It	I think Toni Morrison is America's greatest living author.  Perhaps she is the greatest living woman author.  Surely she is in the top three.  Although \\"Sula\\" isn't my favorite Morrison work, I think it is one of Morrison's most complicated and one of her richest.  Those who read Morrison must remember she is a classicist and approach her as such.  Not to do so only creates needless problems for the reader and Morrison can be difficult to read, though always enjoyable and always superb.<br />On it's surface, \\"Sula\\" is the story of two black women who remain lifelong friends despite their obvious differences and the different way in which each pursues her life.  Set in an Ohio community called, The Bottom, \\"Sula\\" follows these two women, Sula Peace and Nel Wright, from childhood to marriage to old age to death.<br />Nel is the conformist in this oddly matched pair.  She marries and raises a family in the place of her birth.  Outwardly, at least, she seems to need no more than husband and children and community to make her happy.  She adapts.  Sula, on the other hand, is a far different story.  <br />Sula is a woman who feels the need to escape, to break free of whatever binds her.  And, if her breaking free involves pain...for herself or for others, then so be it.  She moves from The Bottom, goes to college and becomes the epitome of everything that Nel is not...in short, Sula becomes a waton seductress.  For Sula, hell is stability; for Nel, hell is change.<br />Is either woman happy with her choices in life?  No, not entirely, and we do find echoes of Nel in Sula and echoes of Sula in Nel.  Though it's not obvious at first glance, the women are really two sides of the same coin.  One came up \\"heads,\\" the other, \\"tails.\\"  Both women are, however, black Americans and both are proud to be black Americans.  It is how they express their heritage, and their love for each other, that differs.<br />Morrison is a masterful writer and her handling of the character of Sula ismiraculous.  We could have so easily come to hate this wanton women, we could have so easily come to have seen her as the stereotypical seductress, the temptress, the tramp.  Yet Morrison manages, somehow, to endow Sula with a humanity and a beauty that shines through all her artifice and pain.<br />For me, \\"Sula\\" is a book about choices and the problems of living with those choices.  It is about loving someone who chooses a very different path in life than we do and what is needed to keep that love alive...or even if it can be kept alive.  Sula and Nel are both beautiful characters and both are vibrantly alive.  Both want desperately to hold onto their love for each other, but fate and circumstances make it increasingly difficult.  The story of Sula's and Nel's growth from child to adult to old age is the thread that ties the other stories in this book into one seamless whole.<br />Although \\"Sula\\" could be seen as an allegory or metaphor for the rediscovery of the core self of black America, I feel the characters, themselves are too rich, to fully-drawn, to alive, to call this book an allegory.  Perhaps on some level, it is, but Morrison is a writer of literature, not genre fiction.<br />All of Toni Morrison's books are masterpieces and all can be read on many levels.  \\"Sula\\" is no exception.  It is a difficult book but one that is both beautiful and tragic and worth every second any reader spends with it.  I really can't recommend \\"Sula,\\" or any other Morrison book, highly enough.	2002-04-06

It centers around the premier of Mozart's opera, Don Giovanni in Prague in 1787.<br />The author tells us that Don Giovanni was inspired by none other than Casanova, himself, who set up a meeting with Mozart in a Prague coffeehouse in an attempt to &quot;sell&quot; the great composer on the idea of basing an opera around the figure of Don Juan.  That part is factual...I think.  That and the characters, dates and delays in staging the opera.  The rest of this marvelous book centers around imagined happenings, all contrived to urge Mozart to produce and bring Don Giovanni to fruition.<br />There are three main characters in this book:  Mozart, of course, Casanova, and Lorenzo da Ponte, Mozart's long suffering librettist.  All three main characters are wonderfully drawn, but just as wonderfully drawn are the &quot;minor&quot; characters, who really aren't so minor at all.<br />One of the best of these &quot;minor&quot; characters is Mozart's wife, Constanze, or &quot;Stanzi,&quot; as Mozart called her.  Stanzi had a few secrets of her own to prod Mozart to work and she often had use them.<br />Josefa Dusek, the singer, and her husband make appearances in the novel when they host the elaborate parties Mozart loved to attend.  The party the night before the opera's premier is especially memorable.  Opera lovers will recognize the garden scene in Act Four of The Marriage of Figaro, but this only adds to the whimsy of the book rather than detracting from it.  This party night is a night of high tension as well as fun, for Mozart has yet to finish the opera's Overture and more than one character is more than a little anxious.<br />Even the Marquis de Sade manages to make an appearance, of sorts, in this book.  Locked away in Paris, he answers a letter from Casanova and gives his own advice on living a life totally without limits.  You can imagine what that advice might consist of.  If anything in this book can be construed as being &quot;over the top,&quot; it is this, but then Mozart was a genius who was, much of the time, &quot;over the top,&quot; himself.  I think it is completely within the character of the book to include de Sade and I enjoyed it.<br />Although Mozart does take center stage in this novel, as he should, he gets stiff competition from Casanova.  In his sixties at the time, Casanova may have slowed down a bit, but he is still quite thoroughly a rake.  Beautiful women seem to abound in Prague and Casanova seems to make it his quest to know them all, or most of them at least, and to let others know the details of his conquests.<br />I'm an eastern European and I've spent many happy days and nights in Prague.  I loved Rudel's detail of Prague city life as well as his detail of the premier, itself.  The details are, in large part, what make this book so charming.<br />The best thing about this book, however, is the wonderful and loving portrait it paints of Mozart, himself.  Rudel has managed to capture Mozart in all his genius and all his whimsy.  We see him as he no doubt was...an extraordinary composer, the likes of which the world will never see again, and a man who took tremendous joy in the simple pleasure of life.<br />This is a gorgeous and fun book, but I don't think it's right for everyone, or even the majority of readers.  I do think one has to be a fan of Mozart or of opera to obtain the maximum enjoyment from &quot;Imagining Don Giovanni.&quot;  If you're an opera fan, like I am, I would certainly recommend this book. While it might not stay with you forever, it will certainly entertain you for a few hours and make your life more pleasant.  And, it just might leave you wanting more of Mozart.	2002-04-05

Although Aurora's selfish and self-indulgent father denied her existence, her mother did find true love, and a very brief marriage (she died in childbirth) with Aurora's father's cousin, Severo del Valle.<br />After her birth in San Francisco's Chinatown, Aurora was raised by her mother's parents until the death of her sweet and angelic grandfather, Tao Chi'en.  Then her wealthy (and somewhat arrogant), \\"paternal\\" grandmother, Paulina del Valle steps in.  (It is interesting to note that Aurora's maternal grandmother, Eliza Sommers, was the protagonist of a previous book by Allende, \\"Daughter of Fortune.\\")  <br />Although the primary focus of this book is on Aurora, it is the widowed Paulina who is the most engaging and, in my opinion, the most lovable, character Allende has ever created.  Paulina is certainly a character with a strong will and she usually accomplishes what she sets out to do.  <br />After her husband's death, Paulina, seeing no reason to remain in San Francisco, packs up and moves her entire family back to Chile, Aurora included.  She also marries her very own butler and, when back in Chile, she manages to pass him off as an impoverished British lord.  Thus, rather then being ridiculed, Paulina becomes the object of envy instead.  Williams (the butler), Aurora later tells us, spoke exactly four words of Spanish and so was, of necessity, rather silent and taciturn in Spanish-speaking Chile.  His silence, however, was revered by the locals who saw him as wise and full of both pride and mystery.<br />Although it may not be apparent at first, Aurora and Paulina are a lot alike.  They are both independent women who become trapped in very traditional, but loveless, marriages.  Both women rebel in the sense that they seek to transcend their circumstances, something 19th century women, in San Francisco or in Chile, usually didn't do.  Paulina becomes a shrewd businesswoman, while Aurora becomes a photographer.  Both women, however, remain true to their cultural heritage and to Chile.  Aurora seeks, through her art, to capture \\"the multifaceted and tormented face of Chile\\" on film.  And, at the age of thirty, Aurora wants and needs to recapture the first five years of her life, the five years she spent in San Francisco with her maternal grandparents.<br />Part of the charm of this book is Allende's very skillful rendering of period detail.  She makes both 19th century San Francisco and 19th Chile come alive.  Although this isn't a historical or a political novel, (nor is it a feminist one), Allende does align her protagonists with the feminine side of political issues.  This is not, however, a book that sacrifices story to social commentary.  Allende is far too good a storyteller to let that happen and she possesses far too much restraint.  Despite that restraint, this book is a sumptuous feast of a romance...high-spirited, lyrical, sensitive, melancholy, rapturous and exuberant.  Don't let that put you off...\\"Portrait in Sepia\\" is definitely literature, not genre fiction.<br />I realize that Allende has been compared to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but I believe that comparisons between these two great Latin American authors are supremely unfair.  Each is wonderful is his or her own way.  And Allende has come a long way from magic realism and \\"The House of the Spirits.\\"  While Garcia Marquez writes of characters in the subtropical jungles and rainforests of Colombia, Allende's characters are firmly rooted in Chile...a country that is more temperate and more unforgiving.  And Allende writes more like a woman than a man; she is more of a romantic, more lyrical in her prose style.  She lets us share in the emotional life of her characters more than does Garcia Marquez.  They are different writers with different styles, and each one contributes something to his or her work that is lasting and beautiful.<br />Much of this book is \\"told\\" rather than \\"shown,\\" i.e., dramatized in scenes.  In the hands of a lesser writer, this could have been a huge mistake and could have resulted in a book that was dry and boring and without emotional depth.  In the hands of a writer as skilled as Allende, however, this device creates a seamless fluidity that only makes the book grow lovlier and lovlier.  And we do become involved with the characters, there can be no doubt about that, for they are anything and everything but ordinary.<br />I don't understand why so many readers didn't care for this book.  Perhaps they were looking for something closer to the style of Garcia Marquez.  Perhaps they were put off by the \\"memoir\\" style of the book and the fact that so much of it is told rather than shown.  In my opinion, Allende wanted to keep some distance between the reader and some of the book's more tumultuous events lest the delicacy of the story be disturbed.<br />I loved the watercolor delicacy of this book and I think one has only to look at the epilogue to recognize that delicacy was part and parcel of this story.  As Aurora, herself, says, \\"I live among duffuse shadings, veiled mysteries, uncertainties; the tone for telling my life is closer to that of a portrait in sepia.\\"<br />I loved \\"Portrait in Sepia.\\"  I wish I could find more books out there like it.	2002-04-05

Some knowledge of mythology, however, is necessary if one wants to undertand and appreciate great literature.  So many great authors draw upon mythology in their work.  One (and only one) example is Milton; so many people who say they don't understand &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; are simply missing allusions to the mythology contained instead.<br />I'm not a classicist, a theologian or a philosopher.  I'm not an expert in ancient Greek or Latin.  What I am is a lover of great literature and it pains me when I come upon a mythological reference I don't recognize or remember.<br />I tried using a classical dictionary, but found this created one problem while failing to solve another.  The problem is that it is annoying to interrupt the flow of one's reading to look up an allusion in a dictionary.  I'd almost rather skip the reading than do that.  And, even after looking up an allusion, at least in a dictionary, we usually still don't understand the poetry and the full meaning of the myth.<br />&quot;Bulfinch's Mythology&quot; solves this problem.  With this book, anyone can learn about the gods and goddesses of Greek and Roman antiquity, of Scandinavian, Celtic and Oriental fable and of the Age of Chivalry, in a readable and entertaining manner.  <br />With &quot;Bulfinch's Mythology,&quot; we certainly won't learn as much as a scholar, but we will learn enough to enjoy and appreciate the references to mythology we encounter in literature, painting, sculpture and music.<br />The stories in &quot;Bulfinch's Mythology&quot; are divided into three sections:  The Age of Fable, The Age of Chivalry and The Legends of Charlemagne.  The classical myths and legends have been derived from Ovid and Virgil.  Although the stories are told in prose, they retain all the poetry of the original.  The second section, the myths and sagas of the north, were drawn from Mallet's &quot;Northern Antiquities.&quot;<br />Bulfinch has gone one step further than to simply present myth in an enjoyable and readable manner.  He has included many poetic citations to help us better remember the myth in question and to see exactly how myth is incorporated into literature.<br />I love perusing this book.  &quot;Bulfinch's Mythology&quot; has reintroduced me to the stories of Zeus and Hera, Venus and Adonis, Daphne and Apollo, Pygmalion and Galatea and many, many more.<br />If you want to learn more about myth, but don't want to make a comprehensive study of mythology, &quot;Bulfinch's Mythology&quot; may be the perfect book for you just as it is for me.	2002-04-05
US	38577070	R3R8RQ57PON9WF	0142000272	289712823	Anna Karenina (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	15	15	N	N	The Ultimate Family Novel	When most people think of Tolstoy, they no doubt think of \\"Anna Karenina.\\"  So do I, and even though \\"Anna Karenina\\" isn't my favorite Tolstoy book (I preferred the exquisite and perfect novella, \\"The Death of Ivan Illych\\" instead), I will admit that \\"Anna Karenina\\" is definitely Tolstoy's most psychologically revealing and most complex work.<br />Set against the Russia of the 1870s, this book, like so many great Russian novels, could almost be read as a history lesson as well as a novel.  There are passages on war, passages on peace and passages on the meaning of the \\"true Russian soul.\\"  And, perhaps in this book more than in any other (\\"Resuurection\\" may be the one exception), does Tolstoy share his own feelings with his readers by incorporating them into the feelings of his characters.  The character of Levin, more than any other, mirrors the character of Tolstoy, himself.  By the book's end, Levin, like Tolstoy, is a man who lives for God.  And, for Levin, as for Tolstoy, this discovery of God, and the evocation of the spiritual side of his nature over the rational and intellectual side, gives a new serenity to life.<br />At its heart, of course, \\"Anna Karenina\\" is a novel of love and especially, of the love that exists within families.  It is about love that works (Levin and Kitty) and it is also about love that fails to work (Vronsky and Anna).<br />Whether conventional (Levin and Kitty) or unconventional (Vronsky and Anna), functional or dysfunctional, Tolstoy's families are families in flux.  The characters change and the relationships involved must change their dynamics as well if they are to survive.  Love, something that is never easy, is severely tested and tried in \\"Anna Karenina.\\"  Some loves pass the tests, others do not.<br />I have often thought that Tolstoy would have made a great film director as well as a great novelist.  He excels at subtle gestures:  a squeeze of the hand, a glance of the eye, a failure to turn around and face one's accuser.  These details and so many more are brilliantly portrayed in \\"Anna Karenina\\" and form much of the book's greatness.<br />This is a book with everything:  riches, poverty, sickness, death, weddings, urban society and the peace of the country, togetherness and separation, joy and loss, love, betrayal and forgiveness.<br />This translation by husband and wife team, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky is, in my opinion, far superior to the \\"old\\" translations of Louise and Aylmer Maude or Constance Garnett.  The Maudes, to be sure, were friends and devotees of Tolstoy, but their Victorian prose can often sound \\"stilted\\" and forced.  True, the Maudes present a more literal translation than do Pevear and Volokhonsky and they remain true to Russian grammar and sentence construction.  Pevear and Volokhonsky have sacrificed the Russian grammar of Tolstoy in favor of English grammar and clarity of thought.  I think, in this case, at least, it was a wonderful choice.<br />They have also chosen to keep the Russian names of the characters, rather than Anglicizing them, something else I very much prefer.  In this translation, \\"Matvei\\" remains \\"Matvei.\\"  In older translations, he became, maddeningly, \\"Matthew.\\"  In today's cosmopolitan world, I think most of us, and certainly those who are going to choose to read a book as sophisticated as \\"Anna Karenina\\" are familiar enough with Russian names to stick to the original.  Substituting the English equivalent simply sounds silly.<br />The notes that accompany this translation are far, far superior to the notes in the older translations, but here I do have a complaint.  Why on earth did the publisher choose to put them at the end of the book rather than as footnotes?  I found myself flipping to the back of the book time and again, when it would have been so much more convenient and helpful to simply look at the bottom of the page.  The publisher did choose to place the translations of the French and German phrases at the bottom of thepage, so why not the explanatory notes as well?<br />Overall, however, I love this translation and find it far superior to any other I have read.  \\"Anna Karenina\\" is a complex novel encompassing all the mysteries of relationships.  One requires enough concentration just reading the book without stumbling through an awkward translation as well.  \\"Anna Karenina\\" is a wonderful book; this new translation has made it far more accessible and enjoyable.  I hope it will be enjoyed by many more readers in the years to come.he page, so why not the explanatory notes as well?<br />Overall, however, I love this translation and find it far superior to any other I have read.  \\"Anna Karenina\\" is a complex novel encompassing all the mysteries of relationships.

US	38577070	R1T4VFQF2Y9F9B	052594642X	838675611	The Impressionist	Books	4	24	28	N	N	The Ultimate Shapeshifter	The first thing anyone notices about Hari Kunzru's debut novel, &quot;The Impressionist,&quot; is that it certainly is different.<br />To begin with, the protagonist, Pran Nath Razdan, was conceived in a cave during the first monsoon of the year 1903, the son of an indulged Indian girl, Amrita, and a silent British forestry specialist.  Although Amrita died in childbirth, a maid reveals Pran Nath's true parentage when he is but 15 years old.  Consequently, he is thrown out of the luxurious home of his wealthy Kashmiri &quot;father&quot; and grows up alone, inventing and reinventing himself and his life as he chooses.<br />Pran Nath had the luck, or the misfortune (it all depends on the way in which one looks at the situation), to be born with the fair skin of his English father.  While this makes him an outcast in India, it does allow him to reinvent himself as a totally Caucasian man...when the occasion calls for it.<br />Neither brown nor white, Pran Nath really can't decide what, or even who, he really is.  To say that his &quot;sense of self&quot; is seriously underdeveloped is a serious understatement.  Pran Nath will be anything to anyone and he takes pride in his ability to do so.<br />Pran Nath, of course, comes off as a very superficial character.  I don't see how we could perceive him in any other way.  The man has no essence, no core, his personality, indeed, his very identity is as fluid as the water in a backyard birdbath.  This is not to say that Pran Nath is cardboard cutout of a character.  He's not.  He's something beyond that.  He's almost invisible or the ultimate shapeshifter, perhaps.<br />Pran Nath, as a homeless teenager, spends time in a brothel (where he's known as &quot;Rukhsana&quot;), then finds employment in the home of the demented Nawab of Fatehpur (where he's known as &quot;Clive&quot;).  With blackmail and cross-dressing as their focus, these sections of the book read more like a farce than anything else and are probably it's weakestlinks.<br />Once Pran Nath realizes that he can make others believe he is 100% white, he escapes to Bombay, becomes the foster son of a Scottish missionary and his wife, the Macfarlanes, who christen Pran Nath, &quot;Robert.&quot;  Life with the Macfarlanes leaves something to be desired, however, and so &quot;Robert&quot; also spends time in the Bombay underworld as &quot;Pretty Bobby.&quot;  This section of the book is wonderful, and the Macfarlane's back story is simply superb, one of the best set pieces I've read in a long time.  Had the entire book been as wonderfully good as this section, I would certainly have given it five stars rather than four.<br />Shapeshifters aren't known for their stability and neither is Pran Nath.  He is also smart enough to find passage out of India when political turmoil begins to tear the country apart at the seams.  For reasons I won't reveal, Pran Nath &quot;becomes&quot; Jonathan Bridgeman and finds himself bound for England...Oxford, to be precise.  There, he becomes, of course, no less than the hysterically funny, prototypical, ultra-conservative Englishman.  And, to put it mildly...things happen.  It is as &quot;Jonathan Bridgeman&quot; that Pran Nath meets and falls madly in love with Astarte Chapel, the lovely daughter of an Oxford professor who convinces &quot;Jonathan&quot; to accompany him on a trip to tribal Africa.<br />The African chapters, like the back story of the Scottish Macfarlanes, are probably the very best in the book.  It is in Africa that Pran Nath comes face to face with his destiny and it is here that this book's elaborate joke is finally revealed.<br />This book is, of course, quite episodic, and some episodes have much more power than others.  While the &quot;Scottish&quot; and &quot;African&quot; sections shine with brilliance and originality, the &quot;Indian&quot; and &quot;English&quot; ones can, at times, be a little heavy-handed.  Both the book's social statement and its satire could have useda lighter touch.<br />The characters, for the most part, are wonderful, fully fleshed-out and quite believable, except for Pran Nath, of course.  And what of Pran Nath?  What are we to make of him?  Is he a hero or an anti-hero?  I think he's both.  He's an opportunist, certainly, but only because he is forced to live as one.<br />&quot;The Impressionist&quot; is almost too much of a good thing and the book might suffer just a little because of that.  Kunzru, after all, needs to save something special for his second book.<br />Despite a few shortcomings and some unevenness, this is a marvelous book and a marvelously entertaining one.  But, although it may sound funny and comic, it is not a lighthearted, fun read.  This is heady stuff, for, at the bottom of it all, &quot;The Impressionist&quot; explores such &quot;heavy&quot; topics as what it means to be black or white or brown or red; what it means to be Indian or English or Scottish or man or woman or tribal warrior.  In essence, what it means to be human.	2002-04-02

Although little of his poetry has survived, we do know it was famous for both its extreme sweetness and its grandeur.  <br />In Carson's modern version of the Geryon myth, Herakles doesn't murder Geryon and steal his magic red cattle; he steals his heart instead.  And in Carson's version, the theft of the heart may be quite a bit worse than outright murder, for, rather than dying outright, Geryon dies a little each day and his suffering is thus prolonged and made all the more difficult to endure.<br />Since this is a present-tense, postmodern tale, Geryon doesn't, however, suffer in silence.  He attempts, instead, as a young school boy (though still red and still winged--he presents his teacher with the myth of Geryon as his own autobiography), to create a new world and a new life for himself through his camera lens and through the redemptive qualities of his art.  In this way, Geryon's demons are transformed through eroticism and become, if not something of beauty, then something that is, at least, worthwhile.<br />Although this prose/poetry work is witty and playful, Carson's Geryon is still quite sad.  Herakles is so definitely male and he loves Geryon in a stereotypically male manner, i.e., without really knowing the object of his love.  Herakles seems out to have a good time and that is that.  Although Geryon is red to his core, Herakles knows him so little that he even dreams of him in yellow.  This upsets Geryon to the point of torment, who thinks, \\"Even in dreams he doesn't know me at all.\\"<br />One of the most interesting sections of this work occurs when Geryon, after some years, runs into Herakles (and his Peruvian lover, Ancash) in Buenos Aires.  Herakles, Geryon and Ancash form a triangle that becomes a source of violence before it becomes a source of healing.  Most interestingly, the village visited by this trio is a village of volcano-survivors who look upon Geryon and his red wings as godlike.  But what I liked most about this section was Carson's amazing point and counterpoint.  Her language is often profound, the language only the most poetic can write, yet in this section, especially, she juxtaposes that poeticism against the bizarre:  a tango singer who just happens to be a psychoanalyst; a guerilla battle fought in the eye of a roast pig; and a surrealistic night flight over the peaks of the Andes with the passengers clutching toothbrushes and Herakles making love to Geryon under a blanket.  Wow.  Talk about creative.<br />Carson pushes the medium of poetry beyond its conventional bounds and creates a profound meditation of loss, of rage, of sadness, of melancholy, of redemption...all seen through the camera lens of Geryon...and Eros.  She filters love through photography, through sexual awakening, through volcanoes, through Emily Dickinsin and she does so in language that is tender, musical, funny, melancholy, witty, sensuous, poignant and downright brilliant.<br />Is our beloved worth the pain?  This is the question Carson seems to be asking in \\"Autobiography of Red.\\"  The answer might well be:  Only if one has wings.	2002-04-02
US	38577070	R3HT0WOU3M9IL7	0525945814	101423143	Falling Angels: A Novel	Books	2	14	17	N	N	No Character Development	Tracey Chevalier's second novel, \\"Falling Angels,\\" concerns itself with two families, the Colemans and the Waterhouses.  They meet at a cemetery, where they happen to have adjoining family plots, on the morning following the death of Queen Victoria.  On that morning, the serious, intelligent Maude Coleman becomes lifelong friends with the shallow and self-indulgent Lavinia Waterhouse (both five years old at the time) and the destinies of the two families become intertwined.<br />While the above may be a very engaging premise for a novel, especially given the time period and the setting in which it takes place (fin de siecle England), Chevalier simply fails to capitalize on her idea's potential, due in great part to her lack of a consistent narrator and her inability (or refusal) to make us privy to the thoughts and emotions of the characters involved.<br />While Chevalier often lets more than one character describe the same thing, she really doesn't let us see into that character's being and so this writing device, one she also employed in \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring,\\" simply falls flat.  And, although I was one of the minority who did not like \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring,\\" at least the title character, Griet, grounded us and gave us some degree of consistency.  This simply doesn't happen in \\"Falling Angels.\\"<br />This is not to say that Chevalier doesn't manipulate the third person subjective.  She does.  She simply doesn't do it well.  Her characters have many interior monologues, they simply aren't good monologues.  Rather than revealing their personalities and detailing their emotions, these monologues serve to describe historical data instead.  Had Chevalier written her book with an omniscient narrator, or had she chosen a single narrator (Kitty Coleman would have been the obvious choice), this awkward situation could have been so easily avoided.<br />One of the worst examples of the above occurs when Lavinia writes out a guide to mourning etiquette, presumably \\"so I shall always have it,\\" but in reality, so the reader will have it.  This is, as any first-year writing student knows, a very bad choice.  I don't know many authors who could get away with this and I'm surprised Chevalier even tried.  Even if a reader can't put his or her finger on the problem, a discerning one will know that a problem does exist and will certainly be put off with the choppy writing style.<br />What makes this even more puzzling is the fact that Kitty Coleman would have made such an engaging narrator and, had Chevalier made Kitty her narrator, the characters would then have been free to come alive, to live in the pages of this book, rather than serve as little more than guides through a tour of 19th century England.  <br />If a guide to post-Victorian England is what you're looking for, this book will certainly fill the bill.  It's chock full of detail and there is absolutely no reason to doubt its authenticity.  Chevalier seems to have done her research very well.  But if it's an engaging story you're looking for, better think twice before delving into \\"Falling Angels.\\"  While all the makings of a wonderful book are there, Chevalier simply fails to deliver what could, and should, have been.	2002-04-01

I have to assume that Faulks, a wonderful writer and a wonderful chronicler of detail, portrayed New York accurately, for even though I am not at all familiar with the locations detailed, they did come alive for me; I felt as though I were really there as well, right alongside Mary and Frank.<br />\\"On Green Dolphin Street\\" is the story of a troubled marriage and a troubled couple, the very, very correct Charlie and Mary van der Linden.  Charlie, a Washington-based diplomat, is the first character in the book to display signs of discontent.  On the surface, his life is serene and any outsider would think he had every reason to be deliriously happy.  He's witty, he's charming and he's smart, but he's also frequently drunk, at loose ends, and feeling the beginnings of depression.<br />Enter Chicago journalist, Frank Renzo, a longtime friend of Charlie's, one he met in Vietnam.  Frank is everything that Charlie is not (or not longer is) and, he just happens to adore Mary.  Frank and Mary are good, honorable people and both of them care deeply for Charlie, but, Charlie's duties keep him away more and more and Mary finds that filling the empty hours is easier in New York...with Frank as her guide.  Frank shows Mary the real New York and, as he does, Mary inevitably falls in love with him, a love that is most decidedly returned.<br />Love triangles are nothing new in the novelistic world and, unfortunately, Faulks brings nothing new to the cliche.  \\"On Green Dolphin Street\\" is as wonderfully written as Faulks' previous novels, but even his superb writing skills can't make up for the lack of a fresh and convincing story.  Mary and Frank's discussions often seem stilted and artificial.  As much as this pair swear they love each other, they lack passion and tension.  No, they aren't cardboard cutouts, Faulks is far too good a writer for that, but something is definitely missing.<br />This is not to say that the book doesn't have its moments.  It most definitely does and the best ones occur in flashback, during moments of high tension.  This is, of course, Faulks' forte, pitting characters in flux against tumultuous times.  Part of the reason for the relative tepidness of this book may be due to the relatively tepid times in which it is set.<br />It is not giving anything away by saying that Mary's life eventually begins to unravel and she is forced to make some very difficult choices.  While the first two-thirds of this book may be lukewarm, the last third is quite moving.  The final chapters even border on heartbreaking.<br />The 60s era is not an era I find intriguing.  Those who do will no doubt like this book more than I did.  And those who like their novels firmly rooted in the affairs of the heart will find more than enough to enjoy here.  \\"On Green Dolphin Street\\" is a good book and one that is well-written.  I just didn't find it up to the very high standard Faulks, himself, set with his previous work.	2002-03-31
US	38577070	R3CLA4R1T806AD	0811213668	256202992	The Emigrants	Books	5	24	26	N	N	Beautiful and Tragic...A Sublime Masterpiece	\\"The Emigrants\\" is a fictional account of four men, and, more importantly, their journey through space and time and the effects of memory on their lives.  Although I read this book in German in 1992, as \\"Die Ausgewanderten,\\" I only recently read Michael Hulse's brilliant and luminous translation into English.  In my opinion, the English work retains the originality, the tragedy, the delicacy and the ephemeral qualities of the original...qualities so perfect for the subject matter.<br />Although the four subjects of \\"The Emigrants\\" are not known to one another, they are related in that each explores the significance of living his life in a land that is not his own.  Their stories dramatize, through the memories of each of the four emigrants, the relationship between historical accuracy and memory, a relationship that cannot be denied.<br />The first section belongs to the retired Dr. Henry Selwyn.  Ourwardly, Dr. Selwyn is an elderly Englishman and devoted gardener, but, as with all of Sebald's books, things are not what they might, at first, seem to be.  Dr. Selwyn, our narrator learns, is not really English, by birth or by ethnicity.  He is, instead, a man who has become quite homesick, and home turns out to be, not surprisingly, a small village in Lithuania that Selwyn has not seen since the date of his departure in 1899.<br />The second section belongs to Paul Bereyter, a man whose suicide comes to interest the narrator since  Paul Bereyter had been the narrator's favorite school teacher in his childhood Germany.  The narrator finds, that although he thought he knew Bereyter, he really knew very little about him.  And, more interestingly, he finds that Bereyter, for so many years, really didn't know himself.  When Bereyter finally finds out who he really is, the truth of the revelation is something he cannot face.<br />Perhaps the most playful section belongs to Ambros Adelwarth, the long-dead great-uncle of the narrator.  Adelwarth is the only one of the four emigrants who fled to the United States, becoming a butler for an ultra-wealthy Jewish family on Long Island.  When Ambros becomes the valet and lover of polo-playing Cosmo Solomon, however, he returns to Europe where the narrator traces him from Deauville to Constantinople to Jerusalem.  In a lovely dream sequence, the narrator himself, returns to Deauville and the dinner party of the Prince de Guermantes.  There, among the assembled aristocrats, are Ambros and Cosmo, sharing a romantic lobster dinner.<br />The fourth narrative, however, may be the very best.  It belongs to one Max Ferber, a Manchester artist, who, in 1939, at the age of 15, was sent by his parents from his native Germany to live in England.  Memory plays an important part in Ferber's life as well, and he spends much time studying a book on Tiepolo and the Wurzburg frescoes so that he may more fully recall the summer of 1936, unpleasant as his memories of that summer are.<br />At the heart of this book, of course, lies the Holocaust, something Sebald's characters feel so deeply, yet never seem to be able to address directly.  These are tormented characters, yet they cannot let go of their torment because it forms an integral part of who, and what, they are.  Lose that torment and, sadly, they lose themselves.<br />Sebald is never without his playful, even absurd, side, and it is present in this book as well.  Running through his narratives, and culminating in the memoir of Max Ferber's mother, Luisa, are allusions to \\"the butterfly man.\\"  In Ferber's section, \\"the butterfly man\\" is a boy of about 10 who chases butterflies in the German resort town of Bad Kissingen.  This man is clearly Vladimir Nabokov, for the scene described is exactly the same as one described in Nabokov's own memoir, \\"Speak, Memory.\\"  Whether muse or mentor, \\"the butterfly man\\" holds great significance for each of Sebald's characters.  And, who but Sebald would have had the imagination and creativity to braid, like a silken thread, the spirit of the most celebrated of all literary emigrees throughout this book?<br />As in all of Sebald's books, photographs are an integral part of the work and, once again, rather than adding clarity, they seem to blur the boundaries between fact and fiction instead.  What is real?  What is not?  With Sebald, we never really know.<br />Sebald, himself, said that his \\"medium is prose, not the novel.\\"  \\"The Emigrants\\" is not a novel nor should it be approached as one.  It is part novel, but it is also an essay, an historical record, a memoir, a musing, an allegory.  Sebald's poetic, crystalline and ephemeral prose is perfect for his subject matter.<br />In \\"The Emigrants,\\" Sebald has done something I have never seen done before.  He has managed to say what is, essentially, not able to be said.  Sebald isn't writing outwardly of \\"Nazis,\\" and the word rarely even appears in the book, yet other, seemingly more benign words, somehow manage to conjure the grimmest evocations of the Holocaust and its repercussions.  Sebald is obtuse and oblique, but in his obliqueness he still manages to be more chillingly precise than any other author I have ever encountered.<br />This is a brilliant book, that much is certain.  It is, perhaps, the most brilliant book I have yet to read.  It is heartbreaking, melancholy, luminous, playful, chilling and almost unbearably beautiful.  In short, it is perfect.  It's message seems clear:  we cannot emigrate from memory.  Our memories are a part of who and what we are and they will be with us for all time.  This book reminds us that the dead are as alive as the living, that memory is as real and vibrant as what is happening at this very moment.  <br />\\"The Emigrants\\" is a book like no other; not even Sebald, himself, managed to surpass it.  This is, quite simply, a masterpiece, a sublime work of art.  I don't know how anyone could read it and not come away forever changed.	2002-03-31
US	38577070	R7PQQTSO8KN2	014100018X	598461998	Chocolat	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Liked the First Half	As with Joanne Harris' other books, I really didn't get any sense of \\"France\\" with \\"Chocolat\\" so I was a little disappointed with the setting, but that was okay; fictional places can often be more fun than real ones.<br />The first half of \\"Chocolat\\" seemed light and fun, a fantasy of sorts, with the most delectable descriptions of chocolates thrown in for good measure.  Most of the characters were interesting (though I did feel Armande to be rather shallow), and the dark element of good versus evil was quite enticing.<br />During the second half of the book, however, things just seemed to unravel...piece by piece by piece.  First, Harris introduced new characters (one in particular) and the entire focus of the book seemed to crumble.  The huge battle between good versus evil, which Harris had spent many pages setting up dissolved when the priest (for reasons never made known) simply left the village.  Vienne, the protagonist of \\"Chocolat,\\" did something that seemed so completely out of character, something that seemed to show she wasn't the friend we'd been led to believe she was, that I began to actively dislike her.  Her betrayal of Josephine's trust was quite disappointing.<br />Had \\"Chocolat,\\" in the second half, developed into the book it promised to become in the first half, it would have been both delightful and charming.  The sad fact is, it didn't and I came away from the book puzzled and dissatisfied.  Why didn't Harris continue to develop the charming fantasy she had worked so hard to set up?  When I reached the end of \\"Chocolat\\" I definitely felt I'd finished a different book from the one I'd begun.  And the one I'd finished was the inferior, by far.  I felt this was a shame, since the beginning had been quite delightful.  I do intend on renting the video; I think this may be a case where I'll actually like the movie more.	2002-03-31
US	38577070	R35CYBNN5YWJEK	0811214842	299351040	Summer in Baden-Baden	Books	5	55	59	N	N	Love	\\"Summer in Baden-Baden\\" is a wonderful book revolving around a single summer in the life of Fyodor Dostoyevsky.  Only one theme lies at the core of this book:  love.  The book tells of Dostoyevsky's 1867 summer in Baden-Baden with his bride, Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina.  As such, the book revolves around conjugal love and carnal love, obsessive love and artistic love, a love of words, a love of games and a love of lazy days in the sunshine.  <br />Dostoyevsky made this trip to Baden-Baden prior to his spectacular literary successes; \\"The Idiot,\\" \\"The Possessed,\\" and \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" all had yet to be published.  Dostoyevsky was giving himself up to his vices:  drinking, gambling, obsessing and, inbetween, suffering from the epilepsy that would plague him until the end of his life.  Like all Russians, Dostoyevsky was \\"extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering.\\"  Seduced by anguish and despair, he gambled away his young, pregnant wife's jewels and finally was himself reduced to wandering the streets of the German resort town in beggar's rags.<br />Besides being an account of Dostoyevsky's summer in Baden-Baden, this book is also a memoir of Tsypkin's journey to St. Petersburg to visit the apartment in which Dostoyevsky died.  Supposedly, Tsypkin's aunt, a literary critic, gave Tsypkin an old volume of Anna Grigoryevna Dostoyevsky's \\"Reminiscences,\\" in which Anna details the intimate moments of her honeymoon in Baden-Baden.  As Tsypkin travels farther and farther north, he weaves his own narrative into the narrative of Dostoyevsky. <br />Although Tsypkin adores Dostoyevsky's work and, on some level, has come to worship and revere the man, his reverence does have its reservations.  Tsypkin, we learn, is a Jew and, as anyone at all familiar with Dostoyevsky knows, the great writer hated Jews.  All Jews.  Thus, despite Tsypkin's adoration, Dostoyevsky would have hated Tsypkin.<br />Tsypkin writes beautiful prose that is a combination of Joyce, Proust, Woolf, Saramago and Sebald, though any comparison is ultimately unfair to all of the authors involved.  Tsypkin's prose is...Tsypkin's prose, though like Saramago and Sebald, one sentence can go one for four or five pages, one paragraph for forty or more.  And, again reminiscent of Sebald, Tsypkin is seduced by memory and its connections; one thing leads him to another, which leads him to another, which leads him to yet another.  If this puts you off, don't let it.  Tsypkin is a wonderfully hypnotic writer and it doesn't take many pages of the book until the reader is drawn into both Tsypkin's world and the world of Baden-Baden during the summer of 1867.  If anything, I wish the book would have gone on and on.<br />Although Tsypkin and the Dostoyevsky's take center stage in this novel, it is peopled with many other fascinating characters as well, some real, some fictional:  Turgenev, Pushkin, Prince Myshkin, Trusotsky, Fyodor Karamazov and Stinking Lizaveta.<br />This book should be read, first and foremost, because it is a beautiful literary achievement.  But it should also be noted that Tsypkin, like Babel, Pasternak, Bulgakov, Solzhenitsyn and so many others before him did not let oppression keep him from seeing the beauty in life or from discerning the truth from the lies.  And, most of all, nothing kept him from passing that beauty on.	2002-03-31
US	38577070	R2XQKE38PIDUYD	0385494149	801233492	Enduring Love: A Novel	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A Glance of the Eye	I think the opening pages of Ian McEwan's \\"Enduring Love\\" are among the finest in all of literature.  \\"We were running towards a catastrophe,\\" says one of the characters.  We know about the catastrophe and we know it is about to happen, but McEwan doesn't let us witness it...yet.  A few pages later, we encounter a hot air balloon carrying a small boy careening out of control.  Several people witness this most unusual sight:  Joe Rose, science writer and broadcaster, and the protagonist of \\"Enduring Love;\\" his longtime girlfriend, Clarissa Mellon; a doctor who happens to be driving along near the scene of the accident; two farmhands working in the fields; and, most importantly, Jed Parry.  <br />As the balloon lurches toward this small group of people, their lives will be forever changed.  One man dies in the rescue attempt, but more importantly, an infatuation begins, an enduring love that is different from the enduring loves most of us have known or are at least familiar with, for this love concerns the love of Jed Parry for Joe Rose.  The fact that Joe did nothing to encourage Jed's love is not important to Jed.  And why should it be?  Our world is one that both celebrates and idealizes romantic love...in songs, in poems, in novels, in supermarket tabloids.<br />Jed is suffering from an actual aberrant mental condition known as de Clerambault's syndrome, a syndrome named after the French doctor who first identified it during the reign of King George V.  However, lest you think this a book about aberrant behavior, better think again.  Jed's love for Joe, and the beautifully romantic letters he writes him, seem as normal and as \\"real\\" as those of Elizabeth Barrett to Robert Browning.  We come to believe in this love of Jed's...until his behavior tumbles into threats and over-the-top melodrama, perhaps the books's only (small) fault.  But just perhaps.<br />All of the characters in this lovely but disturbing book are well-drawn, complex and believable.  It's very easy to care about them and wonder who, exactly, they are.<br />The subplots are also wonderfully contrasted and braided.  Joe's rationalism is contrasted against Jed's fixation...and Clarissa's romantic obsession with the letters of the poet, John Keats.  Letters are central to the plot of \\"Enduring Love,\\" both Jed's letters to Joe and the letters of Keats that Clarissa studies with such intensity.  In a line that sums up the thrust of the entire book, Joe says, \\"Lately I'd had the idea that Clarissa's interest in these hypothetical letters (of Keats) had something to do with our own situation, and with her conviction that love that did not find its expression in a letter was not perfect.\\"  Although Joe and Clarissa love each other with a love that they feel is destined to endure, neither one comes close to equalling the love of Jed Parry.<br />The strange love of Jed for Joe and its seeming normalcy are what make \\"Enduring Love\\" so special, what sets it apart from other novels of love and romance and what makes it linger in both the mind and the heart.  As always, McEwan is masterful when creating suspense or when lingering on detail.  He seems to have an uncanny knack of knowing exactly what to describe, of knowing exactly when to reveal.  Both of these strengths are showcased to perfection in \\"Enduring Love.\\"<br />Those who require happily-ever-after endings won't find one here, but neither will one find a wholly tragic conclusion.  \\"Enduring Love\\" concludes exactly as it should conclude:  most satisfying, though a bit unusual. <br />\\"Enduring Love\\" is a beautiful, though disturbing novel.  It is a book that shows how fragile, yet how strong, the bonds of love can be and how lives can be changed with one glance of the eye.	2002-03-31
US	38577070	R3VG09PHDIA8S	0393309312	750203753	Duino Elegies	Books	5	27	36	N	N	The Epitome of Poetry	For me, at least, Rainer Maria Rilke's Duino Elegies are the very epitome of poetry.  I know others who, even though they admire Rilke above all other poets, prefer other \\"Rilke\\" poems, such as \\"Evening.\\"  For me, however, it has always been, and always will be, the Elegies.  Certainly they are the most extravagant and elusive of Rilke's poems, even for those who count others among their favorites.<br />Rilke, who longed for a place of solitude in the country, arrived at the fortress-like Castle Duino, high above the Adriatic, near Trieste, in December 1911.  His hostess was Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis-Hohenlohe, who had invited Rilke to translate Dante's Vita Nuova with her.  Princess Marie, however, soon left for more sociable climes and Rilke was left alone on the stormy, wind-swept cliffs of Duino.  Rilke, at this time of his life, was known to commit himself to a strict regimen of work.  Nevertheless, his poems, he has written, always seemed to burst upon him suddenly, like a thunderstorm on a hot summer's afternoon.  And, one afternoon at Duino, the opening line of the first elegy burst upon Rilke like a flash of lightening.<br />There is no problem with the Duino Elegies...if one reads and comprehends German.  If one doesn't, however, the problems of translation can be enormous.  Translation, always a fragile task, becomes even more so when it involves poetry, and reaches its zenith with a work as sublime as Rilke's Duino Elegies.  So many versions of these gorgeous poems exist (at least twenty), that the Elegies are certainly suffering from a case of \\"translation overkill.\\"<br />In the original German, the Duino Elegies are the most sublime expressions of awe, of terror, of love, of splendor, of Life, that have ever been set down by the hand of man.  In hands other than Rilke's, however, they can seem clumsy and more than a bit melodramatic.  Rilke wrote delicately-calibrated poetry, without excess words and, the dread of all translators, the hyphenated word.  But, all that aside, reading the Elegies in translation, any translation, is better than not reading them at all.<br />No matter how \\"angelic\\" these poems may seem, never doubt that they are expression of life in the here and now.  As Rilke, himself, tells us, \\"the world exists nowhere but within us.\\"  These gorgeous poems are about the difficulties of living in this world, of not being heard by the angels, and of the tragedy that can so easily befall us.  They are about Rilke's desire for solitude and his desire to escape it, i.e., the need and the utter impossibility of understanding and being understood completely in this life.<br />Although many of the translations are flawed, as translation by its very nature must be, the Duino Elegies remain the epitome of poetry.  They are a cry of terror, of awe, of joy, of splendor at the lonely and solitary condition of man.	2002-03-29

One has simply read it...or one hasn't.  It is the lucky one who has.<br />In this lyrical and playful novel, Milorad Pavic tells the story of Belgrade architect, Atanas Svilar and his journey through life, a journey he hopes will answer the question, &quot;why had his life been barren and futile, despite the enormous effort invested?&quot;<br />His journey leads him to an ancient monastery on Mount Athos in Greece, that holy mountain reserved for men, a mountain where no woman has set foot for centuries, the mountain where Atanas' father disappeared during World War II.<br />Since Atanas doesn't find all he is seeking on Mount Athos, in Book Two, he abandons his family, changes his name to Atanas Fyodorovich Razin and moves to the United States with the beautiful Vitacha Milut.  There, something goes his way at last, and he becomes wealthy, at least in a material sense.<br />Like Pavic's first book, &quot;Dictionary of the Khazars,&quot; &quot;Landscape Painted With Tea,&quot; is a playful enterprise containing chapters that can be read &quot;down&quot; or &quot;across,&quot; much in the same way a crossword puzzle is read.  The person who solves the solution to the ultimate puzzle is said to have the key to the solution to the puzzle of life.  While I didn't find the key to life in these pages, I did find fun and enjoyment, and, not surprisingly, quite a bit of beauty.  So much so that I'm recommending the book to all of my friends.<br />If stark realism is what you enjoy, you'd probably be better off skipping this book.  Those who love writers who can spin magic with words, who are playful and inventive as well as creative, will no doubt love &quot;Landscape Painted With Tea&quot; as much as I did.  &quot;Dictionary of the Khazars&quot; made me a Pavic fan; &quot;Landscape Painted With Tea&quot; has simply cemented my admiration for this playful and inventive author.	2002-03-29

Written in a hypnotic and mesmerizing style, &quot;Swann's Way&quot; begins by recreating life in a fictionalized 19th century French village, complete with gossipy aunts, church festivals and priests who &quot;know too much.&quot;<br />&quot;Swann's Way&quot; is also the volume in which Proust tastes the divine madeleine then goes on to link memory to memory to memory.  Even the smallest detail is not overlooked:  sights, sounds, smells, textures, the interplay of light and shadow; everything was a source of joy and connection for Proust and he records those connections in this fascinating book.  While Joyce lived in the world of the present, Proust lived in the world of the past.<br />So many people complain about the lack of plot in this book.  But do we really need a plot in every book we read?  Aren't some works of art beautiful enough to be read, or listened to or gazed upon for their beauty alone?  Is anything truly &quot;art for art's sake?&quot;  If your answer to this question is &quot;Yes,&quot; then &quot;Swann's Way&quot; might be a book you'll come to treasure.  Yes, it is dense and yes, it does take quite a bit of time to read, but it is time well spent and time that will never be forgotten.<br />&quot;Swann's Way&quot; sets the tone for all the volumes that follow.  Indeed, the final section of the final book is but an echo of the first section of &quot;Swann's Way.&quot;  Although Proust may have seemed to be wandering, he was not; A la recherche du temps perdu is one of the most structured works in any language.  The fact that this structure is not immediately discernable is only further proof of the genius of Proust.<br />The section, Swann in Love, is typical of Proust's obsession with repetition.  Each time the tortured Swann meets Odette, he must re-enact the very first ritual of the cattleyas.  They even come to speak of this as &quot;doing a cattleya.&quot;  The Swann in Love section also showcases Proust's wicked sense of humor, for Swann is both a character of high comedy and high tragedy, and Proust dissects French society in a most deliciously scathing manner.<br />While it may be Proust's reputation that causes us to pick up this book, it is his prose that keeps us reading.  Almost indescribable, it is luminous, poetic, magical, fascinating, ephemeral, gossamer, mesmerizing, elegant and, of course, sublime.<br />I realize that &quot;Swann's Way&quot; is definitely not going to be a book for everyone.  But those who love and appreciate fine literature and beautiful, crystalline prose, may find that &quot;Swann's Way&quot; will become nothing less than a lifetime treasure.ritual of the cattleyas.

In my opinion, this is what makes it so different...and so special.<br />The story begins when Kate Webster is killed as she returns home from church.  He husband, Tom, is stricken with both intense grief and, though blameless, intense guilt.  Although he attempts to carry on with his teaching, he finds each day harder and harder; he eventually quits and, instead, plans an overdue trip to Jeruselem where he visits his long time friend and confidante, Sharon.<br />At first, Tom is entranced with Jeruselem.  Everything there seems to hold some spiritual significance, and, for Tom, at least, Jerusalem is a city of myth as well as religion.  But Tom came to Jerusalem to escape the torment of Kate's death and, instead of escape, he finds that the hauntings he experienced in England have only intensified in Jerusalem.  Tom can't decide if he is becoming the victim of an apparition or the victim of insanity.  But there is one thing he knows for sure:  the apparitions that torment him in the Holy City are always of the female gender.<br />When a chance meeting places fragments of a Dead Sea Scroll in Tom's hands he is, of course, intrigued.  An exact translation is an impossibility, of course, but Tom does locate a demon-plagued scholar who attributes the scroll to none other than Mary Magdalene and informs Tom that it contains an alternate story of Christ's crucifixtion.<br />Despite the above, \\"Requiem\\" is definitely not a mystery.  It is, rather, a study of the effects of guilt on the human psyche, for Tom Webster is a man riddled with guilt...both deserved and undeserved.  I think readers who felt dissatisfaction with the Dead Sea Scroll subplot are missing the fact that it is simply an externalization of Tom's guilt processes and his repressed anger and ambivalence towards women and the power they can hold over men.  It is a thread that ties the book into one seamless whole.  I'm not even sure that \\"guilt\\" and \\"anger\\" are precise enough words to use when describing this book.  Surely guilt and anger play a part in Tom Webster's agony, but so do many other, more subtle, emotions, for Tom Webster is a man who sees the world in many shades of grey, rather than in black and white.<br />\\"Requiem\\" is an richly intense book, peopled with intense characters.  I think it is to the author's credit that much of what Tom experiences is never spelled out, but is left to the reader's own individual interpretation instead.<br />If you're looking for something different, \\"Requiem\\" might fill the bill.  If you're looking for something intense, it would be a good choice as well.  Despite it's dark intensity, \\"Requiem\\" is not a long or involved book and it reads quite quickly.  While I wouldn't want to read this kind of book on a daily basis, I enjoyed it as a change of pace.  Joyce definitely deserves a wider audience than he has so far enjoyed.  \\"Requiem\\" should help him find it.	2002-03-23

Once at the cabin, however, things go terribly wrong.  John, a Vietnam veteran, has been harboring a terrible secret, a secret that destroyed his political career and is now, perhaps, threatening his very life...and Kathy's.<br />When Kathy disappears, it is John who becomes the prime suspect, and not without good cause.  But is he a murderer?  Or is he, instead, a worried husband, tormented by the horrors of his past?  This is the central question around which this book revolves and this is the mystery that must be solved in the Minnesota woods.<br />\\"In the Lake of the Woods\\" is a complex, psychological novel that deals with the lingering repercussions of war on the day-to-day life of the participants.  Whether John Wade did nor did not have a hand in the disappearance of his wife is of less importance to this story than is his deteriorating mental state.<br />Tim O'Brien is a first-rate writer.  His work may not be your cup of tea, but his prose is always near perfect.  I did not think the characterization in this book was as stong as in O'Brien's previous work and because of that, I couldn't care about the characters as much.  There was something artificial about them, especially Kathy, that prevented me from becoming deeply involved with them.  The weaker (but still good) characterization is the reason I gave this book four stars instead of five.<br />A warning:  those readers who require a neat and tidy ending won't find it here.  A neat and tidy ending really isn't important in this book.  What is important is that we feel a sense of satisfaction at the book's end.  I certainly felt that with \\"In the Lake of the Woods.\\"<br />To those readers who believe that reading anything with a \\"Vietnam theme\\" is passe, don't worry.  Vietnam really doesn't take center stage here.  This is not a war novel.<br />This book isn't a light, entertaining read, it's a dark and disturbing one instead.

She told me she was sure I would like his writing and she was right.  I do.  Although I bought three &quot;Carroll books,&quot; I chose to read &quot;The Marriage of Sticks&quot; first because it seemed the most interesting.  I especially liked the fact that I would find elements of both fantasy and horror in this book.<br />It seems to me that Carroll has what might be termed a &quot;cult following&quot; and this is, in one sense, a shame.  While it's certainly not bad to have avid fans (I am now one of those fans), Carroll is such a good storyteller and such a first-rate writer that he really deserves to be far more widely read, especially in his native United States.<br />The fantasy of Jonathan Carroll is not the fantasy of Marian Zimmer Bradley and her legends of Arthuriana.  It is not the fantasy of Tolkien.  Carroll's books do not contain kings and queens, wizards and warriors or frogs who become princes when kissed by fair princesses.  Don't get me wrong; I like that kind of fantasy, but I love Carroll's own unique brand, too.<br />Jonathan Carroll seems to write about everyday people in everyday settings.  In the case of &quot;The Marriage of Sticks,&quot; the &quot;everyday&quot; people are Miranda Romanac and Hugh Oakley, both people who love, hate, make friends, have careers and families and pets and, on the surface, at least, seem to want to do the best in life.<br />&quot;Seem to want,&quot; seems to be a crucial phrase when talking about a Jonathan Carroll book.  For his characters seem to be far more than we would have guessed had we met them at a dinner party or an outdoor cafe.  They have strange, sometimes macabre, undercurrents and emotional lives that are often in a state of constant turmoil.  And this is what makes them so interesting and compelling and alive.  Fascinating even.  We love to read about them, but we sure wouldn't want to be one of them.<br />The first half of &quot;The Marriage of Sticks&quot; belongs to Miranda and seems to be more of a realistic (though passionate) love story than anything supernatural.  This is just part of Carroll's subtlety and delicacy and skill as a writer.  When the supernatural elements make a stronger appearance, as they do in the second half of the book, we are well prepared for them, though we may not realize it at first.<br />Miranda Romanac is a woman who wants, and needs, to love.  She's a warm and giving person, but she is a warm and giving person with one huge flaw...she preys upon others in a most unique way.  It is this one terrible flaw, personified in the character of Frances Hatch, that will come to overshadow and torment Miranda's life (and Hugh's) in the most terrible of ways.<br />When Miranda and Hugh move into Frances' former home, Crane's View, the supernatural gains a firmer hold.  I think the readers who didn't like the second half of this book might have rushed too quickly through the first half.  I have a feeling that Carroll's subtle preparation for what is to come may be lost on readers who try to get to the end of the book too quickly.  Jonathan Carroll is far too much of a gourmet feast to be rushed through; he needs to be savored.<br />In the second half of &quot;The Marriage of Sticks,&quot; Carroll gradually peels away the layers of &quot;everyday&quot; veneer that gloss his characters to reveal who they really are and what horrors they must face.  These revelations are extraordinary, fascinating, horrifying and, ultimately, haunting.<br />I loved the way Carroll juxtaposed the mundane with the fantastic.  For me, this made Miranda's situation all the more horrifying; it made it seem as though it could, very definitely, happen to me.  Add to this Carroll's delicate, perfectly-nuanced, watercolor prose and you have a truly haunting book that you will never forget.<br />&quot;The Marriage of Sticks&quot; is, in my opinion, a very underrated book and Jonathan Carrollis a very underrated writer.  His is first-rate writing coupled with first-rate storytelling skills.  When added together, they make for a rich, rewarding and enjoyable experience that is simply unique.	2002-03-20
US	38577070	RW2YHBOND5GE8	0375713042	41346786	Island: The Complete Stories	Books	5	22	22	N	N	A Vanishing Way of Life	Alistair MacLeod writes of isolation and loneliness and loss.  His characters are often solitary people, yet they are solitary people with a strong sense of both history and community...the community of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.<br />MacLeod's characters are a dying breed, people we don't see many of these days:  coal miners, fishermen, farmers, lighthouse keepers.  They are a people held together by a strong Gaelic thread; they speak Gaelic, sing Gaelic songs and live lives upheld and reinforced by strong Gaelic traditions.  They are a rural people and they very much prefer things to stay the way they have been.<br />But, as we all know, things never stay the way they have been.  MacLeod's rural characters are the older ones.  The younger ones have left the lonely farms of Cape Breton to work and study in the cities.  The tourists are moving in, and, finding the Cape Breton landscape \\"unspoiled,\\" and, therefore, very much to their liking, they are spoiling and defiling it, taking the first steps toward turning it into the very thing from which they wish to escape.<br />In \\"Island,\\" MacLeod, writes mainly of the modern, city-wise, young people who come home to visit the dying world from which they wanted to escape.  What they find is a world and a culture that will not die, that refuses to be obliterated.  \\"The Closing Down of Summer\\" is a story that illustrates this persistence of the past perfectly.<br />MacLeod is at his best in this collection of stories.  His prose is emotional but never maudlin, precise but never terse and it possesses a rhythm so Gaelic it can't fail to strike a chord of recognition in anyone who is in the least bit familiar with Cape Breton and its inhabitants.  MacLeod is not a \\"rural\\" writer, yet his love for the rural is one thread that wends its way through all of these disparate tales.<br />To the uninitiated, MacLeod may seem a bit artificial in his dialogue.  He's not.  He's just being \\"Cape Breton\\" to the core.  The dialogue of NovaScotia is a dramatic one, full of artifice and beautifully cadenced.  MacLeod captures all of this perfectly.<br />The stories in \\"Island\\" are simple, honest, earnest stories about simple, honest, earnest folk.  They may, at times, sound a bit naive, but that's just the total honesty of them.  And, it is the very thing that makes them so beautiful and unforgettable.<br />Some of these stories are older stories, so they may have a bit of an old-fashioned ring to them.  Don't let that put you off.  MacLeod isn't old-fashioned, he's timeless, and this book proves it.  These stories, revolving around a vanishing people and a disappearing way of life, are marvelous, contemplative creations and it would certainly be a shame to miss them.	2002-03-18
US	38577070	R3RFMWRS4BJ4CF	0811214133	895075982	The Rings of Saturn	Books	5	70	75	N	N	The Eternal Present	The 17th century philosopher, Sir Thomas Browne, spoke of an \\"Eternal Present,\\" in which one could move through space and time and interconnect all things with...all things.  In this brilliant book, the late W.G. Sebald has accomplished what Browne could only write about.  He has obliterated time and distance and caused \\"memory\\" to live in the present, rather than the past, tense, and he has done so in a spectacularly successful manner.<br />Outwardly, Sebald takes us on a walking tour of East Anglia (County Suffolk), but in reality he is leading us on a journey through time and memory in which one thing inexorably leads to another and yet another and yet another.  For example, a simple ride on a miniture railway train built for the Emperor of China leads Sebald to think about dragons, which leads him to think about the Taiping mass suicide of 1864.  That, in turn, leads the author to thoughts of the cruel and evil dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, an empress who poisoned her nephew, Kuang Hsu, in a slow and terrible manner. <BR>  <BR>A not-so-lovely Rembrandt painting, \\"Anatomy Lesson,\\" causes Sebald to think about 17th century Dutch customs; the mass executions in the Balkans lead to thoughts of Kurt Waldheim.  There are many, many more fascinating juxtapositions and comparisons.<br />Sebald begins each chapter with a personal memoir, then begins to expand and connect, erasing the barriers of time and distance and causing us to question what is fact and what is fiction.  After all, we would not put it past the inventive Sebald to create much of what he is relating himself.  However, it really doesn't matter what is historically true and what is not.  In this book, the question is not, \\"What?\\" but \\"Why?\\"  Why did Edward FitzGerald translate nothing but \\"The Rubiyat?\\"  How did Chateaubriand manage to keep living after falling so deeply and madly and passionately in love with Charlotte Ives?  In this book, ghosts inhabit time and space side by side with the living; the worldof memory becomes as real and tangible as the world just outside our door.<br />Interestingly, each chapter contains musings regarding silk.  In the first chapter, we learn that Sir Thomas Browne's father was a silk merchant; in the last chapter Sebald's musings are of the habits of the silkworm and the culture of silk, itself.  For Browne, Sebald tells us in Chapter One, silk was a metaphor of the \\"indestructability of the human soul.\\"  I found that Sebald's preoccupation with silk also provided a wonderful metaphor for this book, a book which is spun and enlarged much like a silkworm spins her web, entangling the reader with the writer.  The central metaphor of \\"The Rings of Saturn,\\" however, is one of burning, something that continually brings our memory back to the Holocaust.<br />If you've read \\"The Emigrants,\\" you'll find this book more accessible and more expansive, but also more haunting and, in a sense, strangely odd.  In \\"The Emigrants,\\" time was compressed; in \\"The Rings of Saturn,\\" time is expanded into annihilation.  Sebald wrote this book after suffering a \\"nervous breakdown\\" and he weaves strands of his suffering into his reminiscences.  And, although this is a haunting and melancholy book, it is by no means depressing.  It's enigmatic, hallucinatory, transcendent, luminous.  Sebald's prose is, as it always is:  crystalline and perfect, though curiously detached and muted.  Sebald writes of loss and of decay and devastation, yet he keeps himself, and us, at arm's length from it.  Although he had lived and taught for many years in England, Sebald's prose shows us that he remained German to the core.  Michael Hulse's translation is absolutely superb.<br />The rings surrounding the planet, Saturn, were apparently formed from the frozen particles of one of its moons.  Just as these particles of a long, lost moon circle Saturn again and again and again, so do our memories, frozen in time and space, circle our lives until their very end.  W.G. Sebald was awriter like no other.  He was a true artist who, with his melancholy yet luminous prose, created a new way of seeing ourselves and the world around us.  We are so lucky to have the work he left us.	2002-03-18

This book fulfilled one of those requirements, in spades.  I certainly didn't have to think too much.  In fact, the only way to read this book is not to think about it.  At all.  To simply close one's mind to its many mistakes and inane instances of what can only be termed, &quot;sheer stupidity.&quot;<br />On the surface, this book is supposed to revolve around a rather outlandishly innocent thiry-year-old Parisian bride-to-be, Anne-Sophie, and her far more worldly American ex-pat journalist-in-Paris fiance, Tim.  As this lethargic duo plan their nuptials, Tim ostensibly becomes involved with a criminal case (and Delia and Gabriel) and is smitten with Clara Holly, an actress who doesn't act and who just happens to be married to Serge Cray, a director who doesn't direct.  Throw in Clara's desire for amorous adventures with an attractive member of the local &quot;chateau gentry&quot; of Etang-la-Reine, and you have the makings of a madcap comedy-of-manners with plenty of opportunities for high hilarity.  Or so one might think.<br />But, let the buyer beware.  And beware yet again and again.  The above is no doubt what the author set out to write about; the trouble is, her story seems to have gotten away from her much in the way a heavily-greased pig keeps escaping the grasp of the fellow chasing it.  The plot just never comes together, never gels, and it's almost painful to watch Johnson chase it, in vain, for all 322 of this book's pages.<br />The characters have absolutely no depth whatsoever.  These are the quintessential cardboard cutouts.  Anne-Sophie is impossibly &quot;clueless&quot; in just about everything (she can cook blanquette de veau) and Tim seems to exist solely because Anne-Sophie, much to her surprise, really does require a groom in order to carry out the semi-lavish wedding she's planned in Val-St.-Remy.<br />I've readbad books before, but all of them had at least one redeeming quality.  If the plot meandered, the characters might have been lovable; if the characters were wooden, the setting might have been hauntingly beautiful and atmospheric; if all else failed, at least the prose might have been first-rate.  This book has no redeeming qualities at all.  This is, without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read.  Usually, when someone makes a statement like that, it is pure hyperbole, but in this case, I mean it.  Most sincerely.<br />There is one note that could be construed as positive by the overly-optimistic:  the book is not uneven.  It is uniformly horrid from the first page to the last.  It does not &quot;get better&quot; as the &quot;story&quot; moves along.  It ends with the same sour note on which it was begun.  In that sense, I suppose the ending did fit, but did it satisfy?<br />I can only speak for myself, but precisely because I actually finished this book I felt as though I might need help for possible masochistic tendencies.  It was that bad.  Needless to say, I was not entertained and I don't recommend this book...for anyone.	2002-03-17

And  there is a lot going on in this house which Briony doesn't completely understand.  When she falsely accuses an innocent man, both his life and hers will be forever changed.<br />Briony can't really be blamed for her overly active imagination or for her propensity to see things that really are not there.  She is the offspring of a mother who spends most of her days in bed and a father who can't be bothered to leave London and his mistress.  Briony's older siblings are the &quot;adored&quot; children in this family and the ones who get what meager attention their divorcing parents dole out.  Briony turns to the writing of plays to gain attention and gain attention she does, though not in the manner in which she expected.  This book is, most certainly, a first-rate page-turner.<br />&quot;Atonement&quot; is a book written in three sections that cover a span of sixty years.  The first takes place on a hot summer's day in 1935.  It is in this section that a crime occurs and lives are forever changed.  There is so much tension in this first section (and, strangely enough, this is the longest section), that the pages simply fly by.  Before you know it, you are reading the second section, which takes place several years later and in a different setting (Northern France) and focuses on the primary male character of the novel, Robbie.  The third section brings us to an elderly London writer on the eve of her birthday and offers several surprises.<br />The second section of the book, which takes place during WWI, details very graphic images of war.  Havingnever been in a war, I can't vouch for the accuracy of these images but they certainly seem alive enough.  There are horrific images and heroic images alike and both seem equally integral to the story being told.<br />McEwan has devised an ingenious ending for &quot;Atonement.&quot;  I am not sure all readers will like it.  I think some will wish it had been a little different than what it was.  I had mixed feelings about the ending and the surprise it afforded.  On the one hand, I enjoyed it, but on the other, it made me distrust the entire story...just a little.<br />&quot;Atonement&quot; is a more complex work than McEwan's previous books.  There are more strands interwoven into the braid of the plot.  Yet, McEwan resists the urge to become dark and melancholy; &quot;Atonement&quot; is a book that contains all the energy and fire of his earlier achievements.  It is a wonderful book, filled with believable characters and meticulous research.  If you choose to read it, I don't think you can go wrong.	2002-03-15
US	38577070	R35X8G6VDJW09P	0140434003	363093333	Jane Eyre (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Missed Opportunities but Very Enjoyable	&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic of English literature and, although it's easy to see why, I do feel the author missed some opportunities to make this very good book even better.<br />The character of Jane Eyre is a very believable and sympathetic protagonist.  No, she's not perfect, as a child or as an adult, and this is all to the the good.  She is warm and caring with a tremendous capacity for love to which, understandably, she's afraid to give free rein.<br />Jane's years as a child, both with her relatives and at school, are interesting, but only to a point.  They seemed to drag and I was so glad when she finally graduated and the story &quot;really began.&quot;<br />It was during the middle section of the book, during Jane's time in Mr. Rochester's employ, that I felt Bronte missed several good opportunities to &quot;up&quot; both the suspense and the reader's interest.  For example, we learn too quickly who Mrs. Rochester is and why she does the things she does.  I think Bronte should have built this section up more slowly.<br />After Jane leaves the Rochester estate, her meeting with her &quot;new&quot; family is extremely far-fetched.  I know, readers weren't as demanding in Bronte's day as they are now, but still, I thought this was the weakest section of the book and the least interesting by far.<br />Overall, I think &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that clearly showcases the class distinctions of the times.  This is particularly evident in the early chapters, when Jane is still a child and in the chapters that take place during her employment in the Rochester household.<br />&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that's dated, of course.  Times change and reading tastes do, too.  If one keeps this in mind, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; should prove to be both a memorable and enjoyable reading experience.	2002-03-14

Naturally, &quot;French Lessons&quot; is one of the books I chose to take with me.<br />&quot;French Lessons&quot; is vintage Peter Mayle.  While I enjoy Mayle's fiction as a light and fun change of pace, I really think he is at the top of his form when writing non-fiction.  &quot;French Lessons,&quot; like the classic, &quot;A Year in Provence,&quot; is simply charming.  There is just no other way to describe it.  The book charms and beguiles you; you lose yourself in it and time just flies.  No one seems better able to describe the &quot;real&quot; France than Peter Mayle.  And it shows.  Most definitely.<br />Just as with Mayle's previous non-fiction books, I found I could relate to just about everything he wrote in &quot;French Lessons.&quot;  I had had similar experiences in Provence, in Paris, in the Loire, in Burgundy.  One can learn about more than food in this book; Mayle also details the social customs of the areas and the idiosyncrasies of the people.  I learned there are people who attend Mass to give thanks for the truffle, a festival where snails are eaten by the dozen and washed down with Gewurztraminer, and an actual &quot;cheese hall of fame&quot; in the town of Livarot.  The person honored with the award from this particular hall of fame is expected to eat as much livarot cheese as possible.  In another such festival, frogs' legs are the celebrated foodstuff.  The annual celebration of the bleu footed poulet in Bourg-en-Bresse and the Marathon du Medoc made for especially hilarious reading.<br />Mayle takes us from region to region and from town to town...all in the name of great food.  We visit festivals, restaurants, chateaux and so many town squares, I lost count.  Mayle's descriptions of the festivals and his historical notes are particularly interesting, especially to anyone who is planning to visit France.  After reading this book, he or she will surely come away knowing what is, and what isn't, authentic French food.<br />Throughout this book, Mayle writes in his characteristically charming, witty and urbane manner.  His is a style that suits the subject matter of this book perfectly.<br />I do think that those readers who have actually traveled to the south of France at least once, will find more to love in this book than those readers who are unfamiliar with the area.  But familiar or not, Mayle and this book will certainly charm.  &quot;French Lessons&quot; is a witty, and sometimes hilarious book that is guaranteed to ensure an enjoyable afternoon in the sun.	2002-03-13
US	38577070	R13AU4OJ0S5JFD	0451454243	202730821	The Forest House (The Mists of Avalon: Prequel)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A Tragic and Romantic Tale	\\"The Forest House\\" is a very interesting book, but it simply doesn't live up to Marion Zimmer Bradley's great \\"The Mists of Avalon.\\"  For one thing, \\"The Forest House,\\" is, at times, a bit too melodramatic and over-the-top.  It is based on the plot of the Bellini opera, Norma, so that may be the reason why.  While \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" was an epic, \\"The Forest House\\" is definitely more of a romance.<br />Like many fantasies, \\"The Forest House\\" begins with a doomed love.  Eilan, a daughter of the Druids, falls in love with Gaius, a half-Roman, after she meets him, of all places, in a boar pit.  Eilan's father and brother do not see Gaius in the same light as does Eilan, however.  To them, his Roman heritage causes him to be tainted, and they believe he poses a threat to the Celtic way of life and to the traditions that have remained unchanged since they were handed down from their ancient ancestors.<br />Heartbroken when she is forbidden to marry Gaius, Eilan retreats to the Forest House, a santuary for Druid priestesses.  Eilan, however, does not mourn the loss of Gaius.  She firmly believes they will meet again and, so empowered, she enters whole-heartedly into the politics of Forest House.  This, I think, is the weakest part of the book, the politic of Forest House.  It detracts from the lyricism of the romance.<br />As with Marion Zimmer Bradley's other books, \\"The Forest House\\" should not be read for historical accuracy.  Indeed, sometimes the late author seems to have been deliberately vague.  One example is the lack of dates in the book.  This didn't bother me in the slightest, not being an avid fan of historical accuracy, but I do realize it could irk some more precise readers.<br />What bothered me more was the authorial intrusion present in this book.  At times, the many characters (there may be too many, at least in the second half), seem to exist simply to expound on Bradley's views regarding current events and the environment.  Some of the topics of conversation engaged in by the characters are totally irrelevant to the lovely story in the novel.<br />The flow of time also bothered me, however, not as much as the authorial intrusion.  At times, several years pass between the ending of one chapter and the beginning of the next, but Bradley does nothing to immediately alert the reader to this fact.  We are kept in the dark until either Eilan or her (twin) cousin Dieda begin a conversation.  This is a plot device that is often used very successfully, but in this book, it simply doesn't work and we are often left feeling disoriented instead.<br />Although I found \\"The Forest House\\" to be a flawed book, it is one that is both enchanting and mystical.  Both Eilan and Gaius have their moments of fantasy and, on this level, the novel works beautifully.  We can't, after all, expect everything to equal or exceed, \\"The Mists of Avalon.\\"<br />\\"The Forest House,\\" in the final analysis, is both a tragic and a romantic tale.  I think some readers will be upset with the ending, but it works quite well.  Lovers of fantasy, who do not insist on strict historical accuracy, should find this book very entertaining.	2002-03-11

For one thing, they are simply not representative of the French people or French life.  I've lived in several places in France and I get absolutely no sense of France or the French from any of the Harris books I have ever read.<br />When I heard that &quot;Five Quarters of the Orange&quot; was a darker and more complex book than Harris' previous, I decided to give her another chance.  I can't say the book was all bad; it was somewhat entertaining, though not at all believable.<br />First, I don't understand Harris' preoccupation with food.  In a previous book, it was chocolates, and the French, as anyone who has lived among them knows, are not great lovers of chocolates.  You need British characters for that.  In &quot;Five Quarters of the Orange,&quot; Harris goes to the extreme of naming her characters after food.  There is the protagonist, Framboise (Raspberry), Cassis (Blackcurrent), Reine-Claude (Greengage), Pistache (Pistachio), Noisette (Hazelnut), Piche (Peach) and Prune (Plum).  I found this both faciful and extremely annoying.  No self-respecting Frenchman would give his or her child any of the names above.  I think if Harris wants to be taken seriously, she should stop using &quot;cute&quot; gimmicks to get our attention and try to win it with good writing instead.<br />When the protagonist of the book, Framboise Dartigen, inherits a book of her grandmother's recipes, she decides to return to her childhood village in the Loire Valley.  After restoring the Dartigen farmhouse and establishing a creperie, Framboise becomes obsessed with her childhood memories of the war years.<br />The flashback action is meant to be the heart of the book, but it didn't win mine.  Framboise, her brother, Cassis and sister, Reine-Claude are all very unsympathetic characters who are thoroughly dislikeable.  The German soldier with whom they become involved, Leibniz, possess more charm and attracts more sympathy, at least early on.  Eventually, the events involving Framboise, her family and Leibniz go terribly wrong and the family is forced to flee.<br />As a child, Framboise is spoiled and must have her own way, even to the point of inducing migraine headaches in her poor, long-suffering mother.  As a sixty year old, one might have expected Framboise to mellow, but sadly, she hasn't.  She's as grumpy and crusty as they come.  (Perhaps it has something to do with her name; she must certainly have endured much ridicule over the years because of it.)  Framboise is a crochety old lady who is estranged from one of her daughters (it could be the name thing again) and who spurns the genuine affection offered to her from a childhood admirer.  (Paul, the childhood admirer, is to be congratulated for persevering despite such avid discouragement.)<br />There are recipes sprinkled throughout this book and, while they really weren't a distraction, haven't we had enough books based on old family recipes?  If I want a recipe, I'll turn to a cookbook rather than to a novel.<br />&quot;Five Quarters of the Orange&quot; isn't a terrible book.  It is somewhat entertaining even if wholly unbelievable.  I do believe, though, that it will be the last Joanne Harris book I will read.  There are just too many superlative books out there to waste one's time with one that's not.	2002-03-11

Although the many subplots and diversions are all ultimately tied to the main plot, they are, at times, quite confusing.<br />I thought the character of Smilla Jasperson was quite well-drawn, although she sometimes accomplished physical feats the seemed impossible.  I didn't particularly like Smilla, but I did find her both memorable and unique.  Sadly, the character of the mechanic, who was quite fascinating, was terribly sketchy.  In my opinion, this book would have benifitted greatly had the mechanic been more fully fleshed-out.<br />Personally, I enjoyed reading all the details of the snow and ice, but there were so many of them I think some readers were no doubt bored with it all and probably began skimming over them.  This would have been a mistake because, to some extent, it was necessary to understand these details in order to understand the book.<br />I've noticed that many readers had problems with the ending of this book.  I didn't.  I thought the ending fit the story perfectly.  It was quite complicated and would have been confusing to anyone who wasn't following the story carefuly, but it was perfect.<br />For me, the most annoying thing about this book was the translation.  I found many words used out of context and worse, meaningless phrases and sentence fragments thrown in here and there.  It was quite annoying.  The author is such a skilled and intelligent writer, I can't believe this was done deliberately in the original Danish.<br />If you like classy, intelligent thrillers and are willing to absorb a wealth of detail, you're sure to love this book.  Readers looking for something light and relaxing should probably skip this one...at least for now.	2002-03-10

I'm lucky enough to be going on a long visit to Paris this summer and I wouldn't think of taking along any guidebook other than Rick Steves'.<br />Rick Steves' guidebooks are always up-to-date and he writes in the friendly, down to earth manner that characterizes his extremely popular television program.<br />I found this book to be as great as all the other Rick Steves books I've been lucky enough to use.  In it, Rick tells us the best places to eat and sleep.  Not the most expensive; anyone could do that.  Rick goes one step further and details the places that have the most charm and character, the places where we'll get the most for our money, the places that will help to make our visit one we'll remember fondly for the rest of our life.<br />Rick talks about the places no one should miss, but he also talks about the places almost everyone would miss...if they didn't have this book.  I love discovering new, little, out-of-the-way shops, cafes and museums and Rick is the best there is when it comes to detailing places like this.  I admit, I am an incurable shopaholic, and, in this book, Rick tells us the very best places to shop in Paris, one of the shopping capitals of the world.<br />I usually prefer to wander around a city or the countryside on my own, sans tour guide.  In a huge city like Paris, one could easily get lost if he or she weren't armed with this book.  One of the most invaluable and charming sections of the book, at least for me, details self-guided walking tours of Paris.  Included are historic sections, the Champs-Elysees, the Marais district, the rue Cler and Montmartre, a favorite of mine.<br />Rick loves museums, like I do, and he certainly gives us our fill in this book.  In it you'll find detailed information regarding the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, the Orangerie (my favorite), the Rodin, the Cluny and even Napoleon's Tomb and Les Invalides.<br />Sometimes we need to get away, even from a wonderful city like Paris.  Rick has included a wealth of day trips one can easily make from Paris.  Not only does he give us invaluable information regarding our destination, he also provides a wealth of great tips on getting there.  Some of the day trips I'll be taking, with the help of this book, are to Versailles, Chartres (my first time there) and the place I have dreamed of visiting all my life, Monet's chateau and garden at Giverny.<br />I wouldn't travel anywhere in Europe without one of Rick Steves' informative and fun books, and I'm a continental European who's already done a lot of traveling.  I've also missed a lot I wish I had seen.  That won't happen anymore with the help of Rick Steves and his wonderful guidebooks.<br />If you're planning a trip to Paris, like I am, please don't go without this book.  No matter how many times you've been to Paris before, and no matter how well you think you know the city, Rick can show you something new.  <br />Rick Steves' guidebooks are the only guidebooks you'll ever need.  They are certainly the very best.  In my opinion, no one knows the \\"ins and outs\\" of traveling in Europe like Rick Steves.	2002-03-09

He is a writer of rare and wonderful talents.<br />The three novellas that make up \\"The Island\\" are both beautiful and harrowing.  They all take place in Italy, but in very different parts of Italy.  The one unifying thread running through all three is that, despite life's pain, loneliness and despair, we endure.  There is an unquenchable hope in almost all human beings and it lives on until we take our last breath.<br />The title novella, \\"The Island,\\" is set on the beautiful Isle of Capri, just off the Italian coast near the village of Sorrento.  \\"The Island\\" contains a \\"story within a story,\\" and it is the inner story that is perhaps the more interesting of the two.<br />The \\"story within a story\\" in \\"The Island\\" takes place during the 17th century in a Carthusian monastery called \\"the Certosa.\\"  The monks have become the antithesis of all they profess to believe and, not wishing to lose either their riches or their good health, they bar their doors to all sufferers when plague ravages the island.<br />When the priests ministering to the suffering villagers die, however, four Carthusian monks decide to take their place and, in this way, atone for the sins of the monastery.  For reasons I won't reveal (I don't want to spoil the story), they decide to travel across the island bearing the sculpture known as the Pieta dell'Isola.  Suffice it to say that the images this conjures of Calvary are nothing short of stunning.<br />The plague ends, of course, and the monastery is eventually restored, but all is never as it had been.  Something has been lost, but something quite beautiful has also been gained.<br />The story that enfolds the above is a love story of sorts that involves a mason and a young girl.  At the center of this romance is a horrific accident that changes the course of their love.  Butis it an accident?  Was it only chance that brought it about?<br />The denouement of this wonderful (and very moral) story is far too intricate to summarize in a quick review and it might spoil the ending for future readers as well.  Let's just say that \\"The Island\\" is an unforgettable story of both beauty and pain and one that will change forever the way I look at Capri.<br />\\"The Second Coming\\" is a novella of point and counterpoint.  It is the story of the agonized last years of the reign of Pope Urban IV, a man whose life has become so filled with suffering that he wishes for little more than to die, a feat he cannot seem to accomplish.  It is also the story of the miracle of the Eucharist, however, this particular miracle is not accomplished in any way the reader will anticipate.<br />\\"The Second Coming\\" contains an ingenious plot twist that is reminiscent of the second coming of Christ.  This is a medieval tale (13th century) that takes place in the town of Orvieto.  Once you read the story, you will understand why I say that it is perfectly placed.<br />\\"The Tower\\" takes place in the hauntingly beautiful Val d' Aosta, a section of the Italian Alps just south of Switzerland, and a place filled with verdant valleys and glacial peaks.  \\"The Tower\\" may very well be the best novella in the book and the most haunting.<br />\\"The Tower\\" is the first person narration of a Polish officer who comes to Aosta in the summer of 1945, intending to rest in the home of a friend after the Italian campaign.  <br />The house had originally belonged to a retired teacher from Turin, a teacher who is now dead.  On a table near a window, the Polish officer finds a volume of Xavier de Maistre, \\"Lepreux de la Cite d'Aoste,\\" and on the wall he sees an engraving of a rectangular tower in Aosta where the leper in Maistre's books was confined.  Interested, the Polish officer decides to investigate the leper's story and in so doing, he finds out much about the death of the teacher from Turin.  This story, too, involves a tragedy and a large sculpture and, perhaps, a miracle.<br />All three of these novellas are haunting, beautiful, harrowing and, ultimately, compassionate.  They all contain point and counterpoint, visions of both light and dark.  These are not simple tales; they are multilayered and complex and convoluted, and it may take more than one reading to fully absorb them.  I don't recommend reading all three at one sitting.  Herling offers us far too much richness for that.<br />Herling's prose is both perfect and beautiful, in a spartan sort of way.  We remain a little detached from the novellas, a little aloof, and that is probably good.  There is so much emotion in these stories that a bit of detachment seems almost necessary.<br />These novellas are tales of extreme suffering, perhaps the most extreme suffering any human being can endure, yet all three manage to be heartbreakingly beautiful as well.  Anyone who doesn't read this book is cheating himself; anyone who does, will come away forever changed.	2002-03-08

It was first published in Italy as La coscienza di Zeno, and James Joyce, no less, championed its cause and helped the English translation come into being.  Still, the English speaking world, for some unknown reason, continues to ignore this wonderful book.<br />The protagonist of the book, Zeno Cosini, is a man at odds with himself.  Hilarious odds.  He loves analysis, but hates his analyst.  He's neurotic to the core, but his desire to rid himself of his neuroses seems to be superseded by his amazing, and very funny, ability to rationalize things away.<br />When Zeno's despised analyst encourages him to keep a journal (write a memoir), Zeno does so even though he is lazy and fools himself into believing exactly what it is he wants to believe.  A passionate smoker, who passionately wants to quit (naturally, since this pits him against his own worst enemy, himself), he begins his journal by recounting his various attempts at quitting smoking.<br />For Zeno, the quitting is the thing.  He doesn't care how many days he goes without smoking.  He doesn't care how many times he's failed in his attempts to quit.  What exhilarates him, is the feeling he gets when he smokes, what he tells himself, will be his last cigarette.  The problem is, Zeno needs to feel that exhilararion again.  And again.  And the only way to feel it again, is to quit smoking again, which necessitates taking up smoking yet again.  You get my drift.<br />Smoking isn't Zeno's only problem in this book.  Far from it.  As a man who needs to be perpetually backsliding, Zeno wavers between a law degree versus a chemistry degree, then decides to join his family's business instead.  He pines for the beautiful Ada, but marries her homely sister, Augusta, instead, simply to prove to himself that Ada no longer tempts him.  Naturally, he proves no such thing.<br />Svevo's writing, at least in this translation from the original Italian is elliptical and convoluted.  Zeno will begin a sentence telling us he still loves Ada very much and then end it by saying he feels nothing for her at all.  But it's not confusing.  Not in the slightest.  Zeno's contradictions and Svevo's convolutions make for high hilarity and a comic character that is both lovable and memorable.  Italian was Svevo's third language (after the Trieste dialect and German) and some contend that his choppy style is due to this fact.  I don't think so.  I think he deliberately wrote this way for maximum comic effect.  And it works.  Beautifully.<br />Zeno Cosini is a liar.  He lies both to himself and to others.  His lies to his doctors are some of the most hilarious passages in the book.  But even though he's a liar, Zeno Cosini is one very wise and wonderful man.  By the time World War I is approaching, Zeno is an elderly man who seems to have found the recipe for inner peace and la dolce vita:  \\"Sorrow,\\" he says, \\"and love--life, in other words--cannot be considered a sickness because they hurt.\\"  Zeno Cosini may have lied to himself about the pain of life, but he never ran away from it.  This is definitely a book everyone should read.  It's a classic, not only of Italian, but of world, literature./>Svevo's writing, at least in this translation from the original Italian is elliptical and convoluted.

James is the only author who can begin a sentence and still have my complete attention when he finishes it two or even three pages later.<br />&quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; is filled with the long, rambling sentences for which James is so famous, but, as in his other books, these sentences remain interesting from the first word to the last.  This is, however, definitely 19th century prose and the book is filled with sentences that begin with, &quot;Dear Reader,&quot; or &quot;Our heroine.&quot;  While this might be very tiresome to some readers, in the hands of a writer as skillful as James, it has never bothered me one bit.<br />James loved to write about the wealthy people of the world, more specifically, those who needn't bother working for a living.  He loved studying the way in which an excess of free time affected the choices they made.  The characters created in &quot;The Portrait of a Lady,&quot; are excellent examples of people who, perhaps, have too much time on their hands.  Isobel Archer, in particular, makes some very questionable choices, then does nothing to correct them.  Although likeable, she seems to be a character possessed of an ennui that's virtually unshakeable.  Isobel not only refuses to to take action to correct her mistakes, she refuses to take responsibility for them at all.  It seems as though the more time (and money) James' characters have, the less they make good use of either one.<br />If you're a reader who's not discouraged by 19th century literature and all its intricacies and convolutions, I think you'll find both Henry James and &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; fascinating.  I know I did.	2002-03-05
US	38577070	R155R6KTOW4C2R	0671685635	207023183	Ghost Story	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Definitely a Classic	Peter Straub's &quot;Ghost Story&quot; has become a classic and rightly so.  The fear in &quot;Ghost Story&quot; is psychological, it comes from within rather than from without.  Much of it is anticipatory.  What happens in &quot;Ghost Story&quot; could really happen to any one of us.  As such, it is far more chilling than more recent horror novels, most of which end up being either silly or sickening.<br />Straub manages to keep us a little off-balance throughout the book, thus heightening the suspense.  We think we know what's coming next, but we're never really sure.  This uncertainty kept me turning pages and reading far into the night, long after I should have turned out my bedside light and gone to sleep.<br />The characters and situations in &quot;Ghost Story&quot; seemed totally believable even though we &quot;knew&quot; the events portrayed &quot;couldn't&quot; have happened.  This made them all the more chilling, at least in my opinion.  Several nights I slept with my bedroom light on and even felt haunted by the book when morning came.<br />I found the setting of &quot;Ghost Story&quot; absolutely perfect and felt the book's atmosphere only added to its overall &quot;ghostly&quot; quality.  I was lucky enough to attend college in that part of the United States and I found the setting so &quot;dead on.&quot;<br />For me, at least, &quot;Ghost Story&quot; is the horror story against which I measure all others.  So far, nothing else has managed to measure up to the high standards it set.  It's truly a classic and rightly so.	2002-03-05
US	38577070	R1PPR3AWJYWGO4	0345350499	627223385	The Mists of Avalon	Books	5	83	93	N	N	From the Feminine Point of View, Not Feminist	Many of Marion Zimmer Bradley's books are rather fluffy fantasies, fun and light.  This is not the case with the mystical, magical \\"The Mists of Avalon.\\"  This spendid book is a retelling of the King Arthur legend from the point of view of the women involved, principally, Morgaine, King Arthur's half-sister and Priestess of Avalon, and Gwenhwyfar, the Christian princess and future Queen of Camelot.<br />Although \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" has been criticized as being a \\"feminist\\" book, I don't think this criticism holds up.  Yes, the author chose to focus on the conflicts and emotions of the women involved, but their gender is far less important in the book than is their religion.  Morgaine, as a Druid and Priestess of the Goddess, is struggling to keep her dying religion alive against the growth of Christianity and Gwenhwyfar.<br />The main character in \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is Morgaine and we follow her from childhood to her rise as a priestess on the mystical Isle of Avalon, the home of the druids of the Old Religion, the religion of the Goddess.  Avalon, as can be deduced from the book's title, is surrounded by swirling, protective mists that cause it to be invisibe to all but the initiated.  Morgaine's life, down to its very core, is shaped both by her desire to serve the Goddess and by her despair at seeing the Old Religion being tossed aside in favor of Christianity, by royalty and the common people alike.<br />The book also focuses on Gwenhwyfar, and we are privy to her first meeting with Arthur when, as an innocent child, she crosses through the mists of Avalon to the other side.  As Queen, she is a guilt-ridden figure who turns to Christianity in her desire to bear a child and begs Arthur to do the same, thus bringing about the fall of Camelot.<br />While I found Morgaine to be a character of depth, intelligence and tremendous emotional range, Gwenhyfar came off as shallow, jealous and more than a little suspicious.  Viviane, The Lady of the Lake, who also plays quite a role in this book, seems to be a little too manipulative, but very interesting, nonetheless.<br />Anyone interested in Wiccan rituals will find this book extremely interesting.  The transformations from ordinary woman to priestess and the effects of the Old Religion on the \\"modern\\" world are simply part and parcel of this book's magic.<br />This is a long book, but don't let its length put you off.  It is an extremely fascinating and pleasant read and it's quite easy to find a stopping place should you need to put the book down (though I doubt you'll want to).<br />Those looking for historical accuracy regarding the rise of Christianity in Britain should look to another book.  \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is entertainment, pure and simple.  The portrayal of Druidism and the focus on the priestesses of Avalon, descended from the lost island of Atlantis, the frequent visits to the land of the Fairy--all of this places this book squarely within the fantasy genre, rather than the historical realm.  And, all to the good.<br />I found \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" to be an all-absorbing book and one that gave me a new perspective on the Arthurian legend.  The women involved became more real to me, with many new facets and aspects of personality.  I am so glad I read this book.  I found it magical, mystical and unforgettable and it's one book I am recommending to everyone I know, whether they are fantasy addicts or not.	2002-03-05
US	38577070	R10OKQN8H8U8O	0679735909	627682796	Possession	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A Sumptuous Feast	How does one begin to describe a book as gorgeous as &quot;Possession?&quot;  Are there really words to describe the words?<br />&quot;Possession&quot; is definitely a romance but it is so much more than that.  It is also a satire, an exploration, a diary, a critical essay a heady plunge into Victoriana and even a detective story of sorts.<br />The characters are all gems.  Wonderful creations.  Roland Michell, one notes almost immediately, is an academic to the very core.  Although Roland may seem a bit of a bore in the very beginning of the story, once he steals the letters he so desperately wants, he becomes more of a flesh-and-blood character, more human, more fallible.  Just as boring (in the beginning) as is Roland, so is Maud.  These are two characters who are meant for each other, who only change when under each other's influence.  While academic rivalry may be what sets the plot of this book in motion, it is love that becomes its driving force.<br />Much of the book is spent in the company of the fictitious Victorian writers, Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte and they are fascinating characters, indeed.  Most of the chapters begin with a fictitious work by either Ash or LaMotte.  Byatt has caught the spirit of both of these characters so well, that one could almost swear that Ash and LaMotte were real...and that they really wrote.  Ash is the more open and terse writer; LaMotte the more given to patterns of rhythm and rhyme.  Yet both writers are truly Victorians.  Although many feel that Ash and LaMotte represented Robert Browning and Christina Rosetti, I felt that LaMotte was definitely Dickensian and Ash, very much Coleridge.<br />Byatt, one of the world's outstanding writers, has lavished such care and attention on &quot;Possession&quot; that each page, each paragraph, each poem, each letter, contains material that both soothes and stimulates the mind of the reader.  <br />Although Byatt's writing may seem simple and straightforward enough, it is really exceedingly rich in both detail and allusion.  In fact, there is so much literary detail and there are so many allusions in &quot;Possession&quot; that I think many readers might miss a few with a first reading.  The readers who skip the letters and the poems are definitely making a huge mistake, for they form an integral part of the story; the book could not exist without them.  The letters also give the reader (and Roland and Maud) a great deal of information about both Randolph and Christabel and allow the parallel relationships to come into being.  And, if the reader gives them only half a chance, he or she will come to see that the letters and poems and fairy tales are rich and rewarding in and of themselves.  It is no accident that both Christabel and Maud are identified with fairy tale characters who live in towers (Christabel with Melusina and Maud with Rapunzel).<br />Don't let the subject matter of the book put you off.  Yes, failed romantic love has been done many times before and so have parallel relationships, but never quite in this way.  Never so beautifully, never in such a way that touches the heart.<br />The only criticism I have of this book is that Byatt sometimes gave in to the lure of realism and let her characters speak in such a way as to almost tinge this book's exquisitely beautiful aura.  Sure, in real life, people throwing a tirade don't take care to keep their language beautiful, but &quot;Possession&quot; isn't real life and we know it.  That is a part of its lure and I only wish Byatt had felt the same.  Expletives, in this book at least, do detract from the overall romantic and beautiful tone and from the otherwise equisiteness of Byatt's writing.<br />When it comes down to the final analysis, however, the above is simpy a quibble and &quot;Possession&quot; is a tremendous achievement.  The characters are real and believable.  We love them, we (sometimes) hate them, we pity them, we root for them.  The 19th century seems as real asyesterday and Ash and LaMotte seem to have certainly existed, contrary to the very fact that we know they did not.  The parallel relationships are braided and intertwined so carefully and beautifully that they can't help but capture both our heart and our soul.<br />&quot;Possession&quot; is a poetic, beautiful, exquisite novel that intricately weaves both the light and the dark aspects of love.  It is a sumptuous feast of a book that is meant to be luxuriated in and ultimately, loved.	2002-03-04

Two of the fairy tales contained in this collection of Byatt originals, &quot;The Glass Coffin,&quot; and &quot;Gode's Story,&quot; are the work of &quot;Ash&quot; and &quot;La Motte.&quot;  This is not to say that a reader will not enjoy them if he or she has not read &quot;Possession.&quot; It only means that he will not derive the maxiumum amount of enjoyment from the stories.<br />The other two stories, &quot;The Story of the Eldest Princess&quot; and &quot;Dragons' Breath,&quot; as well as the title novella, are meditations on the art of storytelling and all are very good.  &quot;The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye,&quot; in particular, is excellent.  The only thing I didn't like about some of these stories, &quot;The Story of the Eldest Princess,&quot; especially, is the thread of feminisim that runs through them.  But, on further reflection, I suppose that is typical of all fairy tales, to some extent.<br />&quot;The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye,&quot; tells the tale of a modern day storyteller who loves to meditate on the tales of Scheherazade.  It is a rather pessimistic tale, from some standpoints, though not entirely, and the storyteller is a very clever one.  She proves this cleverness when she winds up with a djinn of her very own.<br />Byatt's characters never seem to be black or white; instead, they are simply people with very differing views on life and the choices that should be made.  The characters in this book are no different and that is one of things that makes them so charming and believable.<br />These aren't the typical &quot;happily ever after&quot; fairy tales of your childhood.  Theyare, rather, meditations and reflections instead.  But they are meditations and reflections that do contain more than a bit of magic.  If you like your fairy tales told with a modern touch and if you prefer them on the esoteric side, this might be a book you'll really enjoy.	2002-03-03
US	38577070	R1UDATA3D3YL8X	0375406956	127846038	My Name Is Red	Books	5	25	26	N	N	Dense and Complex	This dense and complex work is an allegory of the Islamic/Western cultural divide.  Although fascinating in the extreme, My Name is Red is definitely not a book anyone can rush through, no matter how fast he may speed read.  This book is a full-course, gourmet meal and one that requires much time in order to properly appreciate all its many nuances.  There is much about the Ottoman Empire in this book, but the author has chosen not to give us any background information, requiring the reader to do his own research instead.  And you must do the research if you want to get the most out of the book.<br />My Name is Red, on its surface, is the story of Black Effendi, who returns to Istanbul after a twelve year absence only to find himself at the center of a murder investigation involving two of the city's master illuminators.  Working on a secret book for the sultan, these illuminators were using two forbidden painting methods...perspective and portraiture.<br />Black Effendi, a civil servant, has other things on his mind than murder, however.  He wishes desperately to marry his childhood sweetheart, Shekure.  Unfortunately for Black Effendi, Shekure's father did not approve of him.  Also quite unfortunate is the fact that Shekure's father just happens to be one of the two murder victims.  So, guess who's the prime suspect?  Right.  Black Effendi.<br />Although this may all sound like the makings of a very dense and tightly-woven plot, plot actually plays a very small part in this story.  The book is broken up into fifty-nine very short chapters that are told from extremely interesting perspectives:  that of a horse, a dog, the color black, a butterfly, a tree and a corpse, to name just a few.  Most of the narrators are quite unreliable, making the book more fun, in my opinion, but also causing the reader to need to pay very close attention to what is being said if he wants to understand the thrust of the story.<br />These strange narrators spin fascinating tales about such things as the Koran and its interpretation, about the intricacies of the art of illumination, the day-to-day goings on in Ottoman Empire life and the ins and outs of Turkish coffeehouse culture.<br />While this may seem like the very good murder mystery it is, the careful reader will find that it encompasses so much more.  Pamuk has written a fascinating allegory in My Name is Red regarding the self-defeating violence that fundamentalist Islam is willing to visit upon itself simply to keep the West at bay.  The most astute readers will also discover that Pamuk also gives us his version of why this violence is occurring.<br />My Name is Red is a dense, complex and sometimes, very difficult book, but it is one that is beautifully and exquisitely crafted.  Any intelligent reader who is willing to give it the time and attention it deserves will find himself highly rewarded and will come away, not only entertained, but with a new, more educated, perspective on Islam as well.	2002-03-03

Nanson, is both engaging and believable.  He's preening, self-absorbed, sullen, anxiety-ridden and thinks of little else but literature.  He even looks the part he plays:  he is &quot;very small,&quot; but &quot;perfectly formed.&quot;  This man, who could have so easily grated on one's nerves, becomes, in Byatt's masterful hands, a comic masterpiece who is thoroughly enjoyable.<br />Yet this book, for some reason, so often becomes rather trite and boring.  Perhaps it's all the history.  Perhaps it's the (sometimes) extreme intellectualism.  More likely, it's the theme:  that human beings seem incapable of compiling a true history of anything.  But I'm really not sure.<br />Phineas Nanson, one fine day, while looking out of a dirty window (in itself a cliche) decides that he wants more out of life than simply being a critic of postmodern literature.  He wants instead, a &quot;life full of things.&quot;  So, he decides, then and there, to write a biography of a biographer, namely, Scholes Destry-Scholes. <br />From this very trite beginning, Byatt goes on to create a story filled with atmosphere and exotic details, just one of the many things at which she excells.<br />Nanson is a first-rate narrator and affords much comic relief as he struggles to write his biography of a biographer.  Destry-Scholes seems to be purposely evading Nanson; all he can find of the man is a marble collection, an arcane tool used for drilling holes in the skull, an unfinished manuscript and a collection of note cards used to write said manuscript.  It is the note cards that take center stage in this book and it is here that I think Byatt misplaced her emphasis.<br />Byatt is a storyteller of formidable power, yet she chooses to let Phineas' perusal ofDestry-Scholes manuscript and note cards make up the bulk of her novel.  As Phineas soon discovers, Destry-Scholes' biography is not of one man, but of three:  Carl Linnaeus, Francis Galton and Henrik Ibsen.  The more Phineas struggles to make sense of Destry-Scholes' note cards and sort them into some kind of order, the more he sees order and objective &quot;truth&quot; are simply an impossibility.  We do get the joke, but it simply isn't funny.  What is meant to be satire becomes impossibly tired and worn.  Surprising, given Byatt's skill.<br />Despite all of this, The Biographer's Tale has its moments.  There are obscure historical details, scientific facts, romantic addendums.  The book is both intelligent and classy and this adds to my dismay about it, for, although it certainly has its high points, in the long run, it simply isn't all that interesting.  Still...it is A.S. Byatt and I really don't think she can do much that is wrong.	2002-03-03
US	38577070	RIZ47OK2SZIIG	0140441204	433284780	Therese Raquin (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Not Quite Perfect, but Very, Very Good	Therese Raquin is a tale of adultery, murder and madness, but even though it encompasses such emotional issues, it is a novel strangely devoid of emotion.  Zola, himself, said he wanted to write a \\"scientific\\" book about people with no free will.<br />Therese Raquin does have its poetic moments.  This is not surprising since Zola, himself, was a poet and parttime art critic.  The details of Camille's portrait, in particular, are extremely descriptive, as is the dismal dankness of the shop in the Passage de Pont Neuf.  In fact, it is the things in this book, particularly the scar on Laurent's neck, that seem to take on a life of their own, independent of the characters involved.<br />Although Zola wanted Therese Raquin to be a book of \\"scientific precision,\\" he often slipped into rather vague and repetitive writing.  Many times Zola writes, \\"une vague sensation de...\\" or \\"une sorte de vague impression de....\\"  Why didn't Zola choose to use the more precise noun or adjective instead?<br />The vagueness that plagues the first two/thirds of this book gives way to high melodrama in the final one/third.  The madness and horror that characterize Therese and Laurent is, at first, beautifully graded, however during the last chapters, Zola seems to have gotten carried away with himself, for he piles one horrific superlative on another.<br />Despite the criticism above, Therese Raquin remains an outstanding tale of sin, murder and madness.  The claustrophobic atmosphere in which it is told only adds to the book's nightmarish qulitity.  That Zola could accomplish so much with so few characters is definitely a major feat.<br />Therese Raquin is definitely a 19th century tale and definitely an interior one.  Although not perfect, it's still better than ninety percent of the books you'll ever read.  I enjoyed this book immensely and I hope you will, too.	2002-03-03

The writing was okay, nothing special, but no glaring faults, either...but the subject matter was so ridiculous the book would have been far better had it been written as a parody, rather than as a slice of (American) life.<br />Unfortunately, The Corrections isn't a parody; it's meant to be taken as a serious commentary on American family life today.  In my opinion, at least, this book fails and fails miserably.<br />The characters aren't even good cardboard cutouts.  They have absolutely no depth, no motivation and no redeeming qualities.  At the very best, they resemble silly cliches...harmless but stupid.  Even their problems (and the so-called solutions to these problems) are cliches.  I found it impossible to care about the characters in this book and was even able to anticipate what overworked move would come next.<br />Most families seem to be dysfunctional to some degree but no family I've ever met is as totally dysfunctional as the one portrayed in The Corrections.  This is partly why they seemed so buffoonish, yet even this wouldn't have mattered so much had they been even the slightest bit interesting.  The trouble was...they weren't.  There are so many good books out there to read...more than anyone will ever have time for.  Don't waste your time with this one.	2002-03-01

I love art, I love Italy, so...what was there not to love?<br />The Passion of Artemisia is the story of Artemisia Gentileschi, born in Rome in 1593.  After the death of her mother, Artemisia was raised by her father, who was himself, an artist.  Vreeland tells us that the book is, for the most part, historically accurate, and I have no reason to doubt her veracity.  However, the historical portions, the descriptions of the art and the cities, etc., make up the only interesting parts of the book.<br />When the book opens, Artemisia is a girl of eighteen who stands at the center of a rape trial.  Artemisia wants to see justice done, but her father has other ideas and other things on his mind and Artemisia is left ruined and unmarriageable.<br />Although unmarriageable, Artemisia does wed and only about a year later as well.  The union is a relatively happy and peaceful one and her husband, also a painter, takes her to his native Florence where they both pursue their vocation until Artemisia gives birth to a daughter.<br />When Artemisia clearly proves to be the superior painter, her harmonious relationship she has enjoyed with her husband ends and she eventually leaves him, taking their daughter with her.  She travels first to Genoa, then to Rome, then to Naples.  She is determined to support both herself and her child as a painter, no matter how much society is against the idea.  <br />Artemisia Gentileschi was a fascinating woman.  She was the first woman admitted to the Florentine Academy, she was a woman who lived apart from her husband at a time when living apart from one's husband was virtually unknown.  She moved in the same social circles as the Medicis and the other families of the Italian nobility.  Artemisia was, as the title of the book, suggests, a passionate woman.  So, what is the problem here?<br />The problem with this book is twofold.  First, the character of Artemisia, as painted by Vreeland, is both dull and flat.  Instead of giving us a fascinating character, Vreeland seems to be using Artemisia as a vehicle through which to give us her views of the issues of Renaissance Italy. Artemisia \\"talks\\" at length about science, art, religion and politics, but her views are not those of a passionate artist, they are the views of someone totally detached from the day-to-day life of the times.  Unfortunately, we learn nothing about Artemisia's passion for her art, for her husband, for her child, for her homeland.  This is the story of a cold and cerebral woman, not a passionate, life-affirming one.  It is only when Artemisia is analyzing the painting of others that she becomes in the least bit interesting as a human being.<br />The second thing wrong with this book is the poor quality of the writing.  The narrative prose is just awful.  It is a mystery to me why Vreeland wrote this way and even more of a mystery as to why her editor (or even a first reader) didn't catch (and fix) the problems.  Wherever the fault lies, there is simply no excuse to foist bad narrative prose on the book-buying public.  It is really unforgiveable.<BR> <BR>Artemisia Gentileschi was a fascinating and passionate woman.  She certainly deserved better than this.	2002-03-01
US	38577070	R3A429KLX0LAU7	0375504834	316489894	Austerlitz	Books	5	71	74	N	N	A Beautiful Elegy	Those of us who love Sebald's writing, love it passionately.  I don't think this is an author with whom you can take a middle-of-the-road stance.  Either you can't stand his books, or you adore them.  I happen to adore them and feel very saddened that Austerlitz must be his last.<br />I think many people are put off by Sebald's long sentences, which can go on for two or three pages or more, as well as his long paragraphs that can go on for forty or fifty pages or more.  If they are, they shouldn't be.  Sebald wrote beautiful, crystalline prose and his books are surprisingly easy to read.<br />Sebald's books are not conventionally plotted, nor should they be.  They are not conventional stories but meditations, revelations, evocations and elegies instead.  They end up asking more questions than they answer and, in that way, they stay with you and become a part of you more than most conventionally plotted works ever do.<br />Austerlitz, my favorite Sebald work, is set in various train stations across Europe and chronicles a series of conversations that take place over a thirty year period.  These conversations take place between the narrator of the book (who is never named) and a fellow traveler (Austerlitz) whom the narrator first encounters in the main train station in Antwerp, Belgium.<br />The book is slow to start, but gradually, we learn more and more about the mysterious Austerlitz.  A native of Prague, Austerlitz learns from his nanny that he was sent out of that city (by train) prior to the arrival of the Nazis.  Hence, train stations become very important to him for, in a sense, they symbolize his very survival.<br />A student of architecture, Austerlitz immediately captivates the narrator with his lectures on that subject as well as on art, time and various other subjects.  As their friendship deepens and grows, the narrator learns that Austerlitz feels a deep void in the center of his soul that he cannot seem to fill and that it is this void that has spawned his desire to learn, to know.  For in knowing about other things, Austerlitz hopes to one day find out who he, himself, really is.<br />Although this book is not broken up into chapters, Sebald, as in his three previous novels, has used photographs to accompany the text.  These photographs, which Austerlitz analyzes in the hope of learning something new about himself, also serve as stopping points for the reader.<br />Austerlitz is a brilliant and beautiful meditation about time and memory, about how memory is preserved and how it is destroyed.  About the preservation of life in memory's presence and the presence of death in its absence.<br />The characters in Austerlitz, as well as the characters in Sebald's previous novels, try very hard to keep memory alive.  They do not want the strand of the past to disintegrate and leave them feeling disoriented.<br />The pace of Austerlitz is perfect...just like the pace one feels when traveling by train, at least in Europe.  There is the rush through the station to catch the train and find one's seat, then the slow and easy pace once the train pulls out and begins its journey.<br />There is something ephemeral about this book, just as there should be.  After all, time and memory are both ephemeral and fleeting and this is a book about both.  Austerlitz is an eloquent, elegant and beautiful book.  It is a book deserving to read by anyone who loves beautiful prose.	2002-03-01
US	38577070	R344MS4EB0GOB7	0940322668	279279018	The Anatomy of Melancholy (New York Review Books Classics)	Books	5	245	251	N	N	Absolutely the Best Book Ever Written...Bar None	First of all, one has a very difficult problem in defining exactly what this compendium is.  Is it a book, a poem, a history, an epic?  Well, I think it is all of those and many more.  The Anatomy of Melancholy is, without a doubt, the best book ever written, bar none.<br />It was compliled from all the books of the 17th century and is not really about melancholy, per se.  It is, rather, Robert Burton's view of mankind and mankind's condition.  All mankind.  And all conditions.  It is about melancholia, sure, but it is about everything else as well.  Melancholia was just Burton's excuse to write about everything under the sun in a strikingly original way and then have the nerve to remind us that there is nothing new under the sun.  This is a book filled with both endless quotes and endless quotable material and, to the surprise of many, it is a comic masterpiece.  Perhaps &quot;the&quot; comic masterpiece.  Burton chose to publish this book as having been written by &quot;Democritus Junior,&quot; and if that doesn't give you a hint regarding the humor that follows, then not much will.<br />If you like good literature, you'll love this book.  If you like psychology, you'll love this book.  If you want to seem pretentious, you need this book.  Mostly, however, this is a book for people who love words.  Burton may have seemed like a raving madman to some, but he was a man obsessed with a love for the English language...and it shows.<br />The Anatomy of Melancholy wasn't meant to be read from the first page to the last; I have never met anyone who did that and one would have to be more than a little mad to even try.  Just pick up the book.  Open it to any page.  You may find lists, digressions, bits of 17th century prose, quotes, much Latin.  Whatever you find, it is sure to please if you only give it half a chance.<br />The Anatomy of Melancholy is definitely &quot;the&quot; desert island book.  The only problem with taking this wonderful book to a desert island with you (or anywhere else, for that matter), is its size.  If you have the one-volume edition, as I do, it can be terribly unwieldy.  I once tried reading it on a trans-Atlantic flight and had difficulty keeping my grasp...physically.  I highly recommend the three-volume set, if you can find it.  If not, make do with the one-volume.  Just don't go without.  That would be a terrible mistake.<br />Be warned:  this dense and brilliant book is extremely addicting.  Once you start leafing through the pages and writing down your favorite passages, you'll find you never want to be without the book.  And, as you'll come to see, that won't be such a bad thing at all.	2002-02-25
US	38577070	R2V9IWT0CWMUPH	014118616X	512449782	The Sea, the Sea (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)	Books	5	120	123	N	N	The Most Gorgeous Prose...and a Wonderful Story, Too	The Sea, The Sea has become one of my top five favorite books and Iris Murdoch one of my favorite authors.<br />In The Sea, The Sea, we meet arrogant, snobbish Charles Arrowby, a retired London theatre director.  Charles has recently bought a house by the sea where he hopes to finish his pretentious autobiography.  Many things happen, however, to disrupt this enterprise.<br />First, Charles discovers that one of the small town's inhabitants is his very first love, a love who disappeared from his life in his teens.  Believing her to symbolize his lost youth and innocence, Charles becomes obsessed with her almost to the point of madness.<br />Iris Murdoch's books are all excellent studies of relationships and The Sea, The Sea is certainly one of her best.  In it, the character of Charles lies at the center of a vast network of complex relationships and interpersonal interactions.  Much of the novel is an exploration of how we, ourselves, influence what others eventually come to see about people and how they relate to them.<br />Although relationships take center stage in this novel, there is much symbolism and even a little of the supernatural.  The sea is so ever-present in this book that it almost seems to be a character in and of itself.  Charles reacts to the sea in many ways, some benign, some not so benign.  The sea, itself, is portrayed as something that is untimately not able to be understood or controlled, much as is life.<br />Although this book is passionately moral, it is definitely not a treatise on how to behave in a moral fashion.  In fact, many of Murdoch's characters could be said to be anything but \\"moral.\\"  The values and consequences portrayed in this book are done with such a skillful hand, that The Sea, The Sea sits head and shoulders above Murdoch's other books, good as they are.<br />Just like the theatrical world it explores, The Sea, The Sea, is a showy, dramatic and powerfully effective book.  It is Iris Murdoch's masterpiece and a huge reward for any reader.	2002-02-24

Although Trujillo's regime was marked by corruption and brutality, the United States saw it as far less threatening than communism under Fidel Castro.<br />To construct the intricate plot of The Feast of the Goat, Vargas Llosa has used a device known as a braid.  This particular braid consists of three strands and many, many viewpoints, making this quite a \\"big book.\\"<br />The strand I found most intriguing is the only one that is, I think, fictional.  It is the story of Urania Cabral, a woman who is returning to the Dominican Republic after 35 years in self-imposed exile.  Her story consists mainly of past events, told through flashbacks.  We are not exactly sure why Urania returns and neither is she.  She tells her father, Augustin Cabral, who had been a high-ranking official in Trujillo's government, that she never intended to return, not even to bury him.<br />As Augustin lies silent due to a stroke, Urania recounts the events that lead to her departure at the age of fourteen, just two weeks before Trujillo's assassination.  It is obvious that Urania hates her father, and readers learn the reason why before the characters in the book do.<br />Another fascinating strand in Vargas Llosa's braid traces the last day of Trujillo's life.  We know that he was obsessed with cleanliness, appearance, order and discipline.  Just how obsessed becomes clear as we read the book.  In The Feast of the Goat, Vargas Llosa has blended the historical with the speculative and has<BR>come up with a fascinating and vivid portrait of a man who was one of history's most egotistical, tyrannical and debased leaders.<br />The third strand of Vargas Llosa's braid centers on those who are plotting the assassination of Trujillo.  Vargas Llosa ups the suspense by not beginning this narrative until a few hours prior to the assassination and by giving each of the assassins his own perspective on his involvement in the plot.  We know, of course, how this plot strand ends.  Vargas Llosa, however, keeps momentum high by graphically recounting the barbarous fate of the assassins.  Be warned:  this is definitely not a book for the faint-of-heart.  Simply because we already know how this novel comes out, from a historical perspective, does not mean we can simply resign ourselves to the horror.<br />Vargas Llosa lets us know that there are those who lament the assassination of Trujillo, as brutal as he was.  One of the characters laments that people lived better during Trujillo's regime and that there were more jobs and less crime.  In the weeks and months following the assassination, the horror, the corruption and the fear that accompanied Trujillo's regime seem to have been forgotten.  Perhaps this is a part of this masterful novel's message.  If so, it is a masterful touch, for it only serves to make the horror all that more real and despicable.<br />I don't think anyone can read this masterpiece of a book and not come away changed.  I certainly didn't.  The Feast of the Goat is not a pretty book, but it is one that is extremely important and one that I will never forget.	2002-02-24

I loved the film version of Horseman on the Roof but the book definitely leaves something to be desired.  If I didn't have such a soft spot in my heart for Giono, I would have only given it three stars.<br />The Horseman on the Roof is the story of Angelo Pardi, a young Italian who is making his way across the French countryside to his home in Italy during the cholera epidemic.  Unfortunately, the book lacks a cohesive storyline and Angelo simply meanders from one village to another, encountering first one cholera victim, then another.<br />While The Horseman on the Roof isn't strong on plot and certainly won't keep you up at night turning pages, it does contain gorgeous descriptions of Provence.  Giono's descriptive writing is the equivalent of a full-course gourmet meal and anyone interested in the south of France, especially during this period in history, will find the book fascinating reading.<br />There really isn't a story here, so perhaps the book doesn't deserve the four stars I gave it, but Giono's prose, however, is so lush and beautiful I couldn't justify giving it any number fewer.<br />If you love gorgeous prose, France or are interested in the cholera epidemic, by all means, read this book.  Others will no doubt find the film more engrossing as I did.	2002-02-19

It's sweet, sexy, sad, funny, affectionate, tender, heartbreaking, engrossing and...perfect.<br />The Way I Found Her is the first-person narrative of Lewis Little's rite-of-passage from the world of childhood to the world of the adult. Rose Tremain has done such a masterful job of bringing Lewis to life, one would almost think The Way I Found Her was a memoir rather than a novel. There is a wonderful mix of the child Lewis still is and the adult he is rapidly becoming. And, this mix is not only charming and endearing...it's believable. For me, Lewis Little is far more \\"real\\" and unforgettable than many more famous (and more highly-touted) literary characters. I really felt I knew Lewis inside and out; I could feel his fear, his hope, his pain, his joy.<br />On its surface, The Way I Found Her may seem to be the story of a disappearance, but the disappearance itself actually plays a very small part in the story. Its importance lies in its impact on Lewis and in the way it changes him; this isn't a fun, little caper story, its definitely a portrait of one lovely and precocious boy's coming-of-age through his own \\"trial by fire.\\" If there is one thread that runs through all of Tremain's novels, it seems to be one of isolation and loneliness. Lewis, like all of Tremain's protagonists is isolated and, in many respects, lonely.<br />Lewis Little is charming and he is forced, through no fault of his own, to give up much of the innocence of childhood during the summer we spend with him in Paris, but he still has far to go before fully entering the cynical world of the adult. This makes him a rather unreliable narrator and an even less reliable detective. He makes wild assumptions, he is led down false paths, he devises outlandish hypotheses. Sometimes these work out, but more often than not, they don't. Still, Lewis, in grand thirteen-year old fashion, isunfazed.<br />Those looking for a plot that races at breakneck speed should really look elsewhere. The Way I Found Her is, at its heart, an interior book. It is a chronicle of Lewis Little at age thirteen, (almost fourteen), and, as such, it is fascinating. Quite psychological and literary, The Way I Found Her bases its protagonist on an earlier one...one found in Le Grand Meaulnes, a very French book in which Lewis just happens to be engrossed. And, just as that book honored adolescence, especially male adolescence, so does The Way I Found Her.<br />The Way I Found Her is first and foremost a superb story, written by an author who possesses superb storytelling skills. But it is also an endearing portrait of a young boy poised on the brink of adulthood who wants to fly and yet knows that in that flying he will relinquish something precious and irretrievable.<br />The Way I Found Her is a book that tugs at your heart; Lewis Little is a character who burrows into your soul and stays there. This is a thoroughly enjoyable story and one that is also unforgettable.	2002-02-19

When I can't watch the show (and even when I can), I love perusing Rick's books.  Rick is so personable and enjoyable I almost feel as though the books were written by a good friend.<br />Rick Steves' travel books don't detail the usual.  Why should they?  We all know to visit the Coliseum when in Rome, the Parthenon when in Athens and Notre Dame when in Paris.  Rick's books are gems precisely because they detail those out-of-the-way places that any ordinary tourist would no doubt miss if he didn't have Rick's books to guide him.<br />In addition to fascinating places, Rick also gives us much useful information about hotels, restaurants and local customs.  Unless you're traveling with an unlimited budget, this information is invaluable to both the novice and the more seasoned traveler.  Even if money is &quot;no object&quot; Rick's tips will help you to see the &quot;real&quot; Paris, the &quot;real&quot; Venice, the &quot;real&quot; Spain.  They'll lead you to places you never even dreamed existed but you'll be thankful you found.<br />Rick writes in a very down-to-earth and friendly style that is simply a joy to read and a radical departure from the dry, conventional guidebooks most authors write.<br />As a continental European, I've found Rick's books invaluable when visiting other parts of Europe.  If you're planning a trip to Europe, one (or several) of Rick Steves' books can only make your trip all the more enjoyable.	2002-02-19

In fact, I resisted reading it for many months, but friends finally talked my into it.  I wish I had held my ground.<br />de Botton is certainly right about one thing:  Proust can definitely change your life.  He's changed mine.  I just don't think anyone's life will be changed in the manner in which de Botton suggests.<br />How Proust Can Change Your Life is meant to amuse, but I found it more than mildly irritating.  Had de Botton been a better writer I suppose I would have been amused, or, conversely, had Proust been a lesser writer, I might not have been irritated, but as it is....<br />Non-Proust fans will probably not understand the gist of this book.  Proust fans will be able to correctly second guess de Botton every time.  Thus, either way you look at it, the fun is spoiled.  It might serve as an introduction to someone who wants to read Proust but finds the genuine article a bit daunting, but I do have my doubts.  I think those who enjoy this book haven't read and studied Proust...in depth.<br />I do have something positive to say...it is obvious that de Botton has read and studied Proust.  Why he chose to mock this great author in this manner is simply beyond me.  Proust was never meant to be cute and sweet as de Botton attempts to be.  And he certainly never meant to degenerate into self-help.<br />I love Proust.  He is one of my alltime favorite authors.  Read Proust, by all means, but read the genuine article.  You'll come away far, far more enriched.	2002-02-19

Written by Renoir's middle son, Jean, Renoir, My Father not only gives us an intimate look at the life of Auguste Renoir, it gives us an intimate look at the Paris of Renoir's day as well.<br />As we get to know Renoir we get to know his contemporaries, too.  Jean Renoir writes about Monet, Cezanne, Manet, Sisley and many other great artists.  We learn many &quot;little known&quot; facts, such as Monet's penchant for lace and his &quot;artful&quot; way with the ladies.<br />Paris really comes alive in this book.  Many of the places Renoir writes about still exist and can be visited today.  This book makes any art lover's trip to Paris more meaningful whether he's a Renoir fan or not.<br />When reading this book, one must remember that this is not a &quot;run of the mill&quot; biography.  This is a son writing about the father he adored.  The portrait we are given is very intimate, detailed and loving.  It's obvious that Jean Renoir adored his father, just as Auguste Renoir adored his family.<br />Ultimately, this book is a beautiful tribute from a loving son to a father who was one of history's consummate artists. If you have any interest at all in art, this is one book you simply must not pass up.  The last page alone will break your heart.	2002-02-19

A cross between satire and the picaresque, it's loaded with symbolism.  To get the most out of it, I think one must have at least a rudimentary knowledge of Stalinist Russia.<br />Happy Moscow, through its heroine, Moscow Chestnova, sets aside blithe idealism and explores the gulf that, in reality, existed between Stalin's \\"triumphant\\" socialism and the low living standards and bleak expectations of the people.<br />Moscow Chestnova, the heroine of Happy Moscow, was never meant to be seen as an individual.  She's Every Citizen, the idea and the ideal of Stalinist Collectivity.  More than anything, Moscow Chestnova cares; she embraces fully Dostoyevsky's mandate that \\"All are responsible for all.\\"  She cares about cleanliness, the proper heating of water, the driving of piles into the Moscow River.  Following Stalinist ideology, she's the ideal every man desires and she gives of herself freely to anyone who asks.  In Moscow Chestnova's world, as in Stalin's Moscow, there will always be room for \\"one more.\\"<br />Just as Moscow Chestnova seeks to transcend the limits of individuality in favor of collectivity, so do the other characters in this book.  One, in particular, buys a new passport and thus changes his identity.  He goes on to acquire a new job, a new wife and a new family...all in the name of communist idealism.<br />Moscow Chestnova, of course, is eventually repelled by what she had, at first, embraced.  She feels the isolation of the people, the lack of peace in their homes and in their lives and the oppressive sadness that covers the city like a blanket.  Moscow finally comes to realize that even as individuals have been ignored, collectivity has gone to hell.<br />The language used in Happy Moscow ranges from the hilarious to the grotesque.  Stylistically, the book is often absurd in its juxtapositions.  Puns are rarely used for comic effect alone; they often contain important ideological or philosophical commentary.  Platonov also has a unique ability of recontextualizing Stalin's rhetoric (drawn from his own speeches) in ludicrous parody and metaphor.<br />Happy Moscow is a gem of a book.  It is a book, that, like the city of Moscow, herself, is, by turns, comic, creative, grotesque, and bizarre, yet ultimately crippled.  It's a shame this book is not more widely read and better known.	2002-02-17

In fact, the language seemed a little too beautiful for the cruel subject matter and the lives of some of the characters.<br />Although this book has a political theme (four prisoners are sentenced to death for plotting against the Bourbon monarchy), this really isn't a political book in any sense of the word.  Instead, it's a study of deception, of truth, of what is real and what is only imagined.  It's a study of cunning storytelling that will keep any intelligent reader engrossed until the very last page.  Bufalino is certainly playing a game with the reader, but he does play fair.<br />The four prisoners decide to pass the last night of their lives with each telling a tale that is significant in his life.  While each has a tale to tell, how much of his tale is truth and how much is deception?  And who, in the end, will discern the truth from the lie?<br />The answer is right in front of us, almost from page one, something that makes Night's Lies all the more intriguing.<br />Night's Lies is a short book, a novella really, that can easily be read in one sitting, surely in one evening.  It is, however, despite its brevity, a book that packs a punch.  Well worth the time and highly recommended.	2002-02-17

Sparrow is not one the them.  Instead, this exquisite miniature is an intimate psychological portrait of one young girl, a girl destined to become a nun against her wishes, a portrait of her one and only summer of happiness and the ultimate tragedy that underscores her life.<br />The plot of this lovely novella could have so easily degenrated into pure, unvarnished sentimentality in the hands of an author less talented than Verga.  Verga's descriptions of the people, of the Sicilian countryside, of convent life, as well as his use of third person narration, are so convincing, so full of sharp edges, that we can't help but believe they are real.<br />Boosting the book's credibility, however, is the undeniable fact that Catholic Europe often sent its unwanted sons and daughters to both monasteries and convents.  This was simply cruel social reality; whether or not the child in question actually had a religious vocation was deemed superfluous.  Sicily was the last to abandon this inhumane practice and, as a result, it's convents became little more than rceptacles of human refuse:  filthy, overcrowded buildings that housed unwilling, but desperate, residents.<br />It would seem that Verga's story has some basis in fact.  Some  of his aunts were nuns and his mother, Donna Caterina, a member of the minor nobility, had been convent educated.  She, herself, told Verga the story of a young girl who lived in a convent in the \\"madowman's cell,\\" a place from which were heard shrieks, moans and ungodly bursts of inhuman laughter.<br />Set in 1854, Sparrow depicts a Sicily ravaged by the cholera epidemic.  The emotions depicted in the book are both organized and feverish and it is to Verga's credit that he keeps them from spilling over into melodrama.<br />The story, itself, is told in a series of letters.  These letters begin rationally enough but they soon begin to be filled with madness...the madness of an absolute love that could never be.<br />Simple and poetic, Sparrow tells a horrifying tale that so easily could have slipped into the cliche, yet happily doesn't.  A wonderful study of a life gone so terrible wrong.	2002-02-17

I realize the story was more surrealistic than realistic, but I feel both the Drome Hotel and the character of DJ Cormorant should have played a larger role in the story.<br />The characters were as twisted and demented as the story of which they are a part.  I felt distanced from them but I think this is to be expected when reading a story such as this one.<br />I enjoyed this highly-imaginative book as a change of pace and it's obvious that Alan Warner is an innovative, original and brilliant writer.  I think These Demented Lands will appeal to those who enjoy surrealistic, hallucinatory, postmodern literature.  Those who require more conventionally plotted stories will probably be disappointed.  Nevertheless, if you're looking for something different, give this well-written book a try.	2002-02-17

It's difficult to believe the incidents described are really fiction and not the author's reality...they are described so well and in just the right detail.<br />Reading in the Dark is a story of ghosts, of legends, and most of all, of secrets...Irish secrets.  The narrator, whose name we never learn, struggles to unravel the truth of those secrets and as he does, he learns what it really means to grow up in Northern Ireland, surrounded by the shadows of political turmoil.<br />Although I really didn't identify with any of the characters in this book, I found them very engrossing and came to care about them deeply.  Some of the characters are quite well-fleshed out while others remain only fragments of the author's imagination.  Most make only brief appearances in the novel, although one, Liam, shares the spotlight with the unnamed narrator.<br />Reading in the Dark is a different sort of coming-of-age story.  It is beautiful, lyrical, brutal and truly unforgettable.  And truly the work of an Irish mind.	2002-02-14
US	38577070	RS3MZH018MDLE	094032220X	329746968	Memoirs of My Nervous Illness (New York Review Books Classics)	Books	5	52	54	N	N	The Poetry of Madness	Shortly after the death of Daniel Paul Schreber, Sigmund Freud used his (Schreber's) memoirs as the basis for a fantasy of his own.  Everyday readers are lucky that Schreber wrote down so much of what he saw, heard and felt during his many years in German mental asylums, for his own observations are far more artistic and harrowing than anything Freud ever wrote.<br />In this book, Schreber takes us into his world--the world of the genuine schizophrenic.  He writes of the \\"little men\\" who come to invade his body and of the stars from which they came.<br />That these \\"little men\\" choose to invade Schreber's body in more ways than one only makes his story all the more harrowing.  At night, he tells us, they would drip down onto his head by the thousands, although he warned them against approaching him.<br />Schreber's story is not the only thing that is disquieting about this book.  His style of writing is, too.  It is made up of the ravings of a madman, yet it contains a fluidity and lucidity that rival that of any \\"logical\\" person.  It only takes a few pages before we become enmeshed in the strange smells, tastes, insights and visions he describes so vividly.<br />Much of this book is hallucinatory; for example, Schreber writes of how the sun follows him as he moves around the room, depending on the direction of his movements.  And, although we know the sun was not following Schreber, his explanation makes sense, in an eerie sort of way.<br />What Schreber has really done is to capture the sheer poetry of insanity and madness in such a way that we, as his readers, feel ourselves being swept along with him into his world of fantasy.  It is a world without anchors, a world where the human soul is simply left to drift and survive as best it can.  Eventually, one begins to wonder if madness is contagious.  Perhaps it is.  The son of physician, Moritz Schreber, Schreber came from a family of \\"madmen,\\" to a greater or lesser degree.<br />Memoirs of My Nervous Illness has definitely made Schreber one of the most well-known and quoted patients in the history of psychiatry...and with good reason.  He had a mind that never let him live in peace and he chronicles its intensity perfectly.  He also describes the fascinating point and counterpoint of his \\"inner dialogues,\\" an internal voice that chattered constantly, forcing Schreber to construct elaborate schemes to either explain it or escape it.  He tries suicide and when that fails, he attempts to turn himself into a diaphanous, floating woman.<br />Although no one is sure what madness really is, it is clear that for Schreber it was something he described as \\"compulsive thinking.\\"  This poor man's control center had simply lost control.  The final vision we have of Schreber in this book is harrowing in its intensity and in its angst.  Pacing, with the very sun paling before his gaze, this brilliant madman walked up and down his cell, talking to anyone who would listen.<br />This is a harrowing, but fascinating book and is definitely not for the faint of heart.  Schreber describes man's inner life in as much detail as a Hamlet or a Ulysses.  The most terrifying part is that in Schreber, we see a little of both ourselves and everyone we know.	2002-02-14

A beautiful meditation on love and longing, Sputnik Sweetheart embodies Murakami's signature themes of loneliness, isolation and longing, themes that are familiar to all of his readers.  <br />I think Murakami's greatest talent (and he has many) is the cherished ability to embody the universal in his characters, and the three main characters in Sputnik Sweetheart are no exception.  More &quot;human&quot; and less &quot;surreal&quot; than A Wild Sheep Chase (my personal favorite), Sputnik Sweetheart is not quite as straightforward as Norwegian Wood, nor is it as dense and convoluted as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.  It is, however, filled with depth and beauty.  Anyone who believes this is a &quot;light&quot; Murakami novel is definitely missing something.<br />Murakami tells this beautiful story in his characteristic flat, deadpan tone, all of which adds to the book's charm.  I really felt I had become a part of the narrator's world and the pages just flew by.  I would have loved it had the book been twice as long, but Murakami never commits the sin of overwriting.<br />Sputnik Sweetheart is a wonderful choice to begin reading Murakami's works.  Poignant, sad, joyous, beautiful, Sputnik Sweetheart explores the depths of feeling and possibility inherent in almost all of us.	2002-02-11

Unlike many other denser books, The Last Unicorn is light in both tone and content.  There is a fey air of the absurd about it that makes it all the more magical.<br />While I can put other fantasy books aside, I simply had to read The Last Unicorn from cover to cover in one sitting.  It really drew me into its own unique world; a world both beautiful and elusive.<br />The story is a simple one revolving around a unicorn (she is never named) who leaves her enchanted lilac wood only to find that she is the last surviving unicorn.  She decides to go on a quest in order to discover why, and is soon joined by Schmendrick the magician and Molly Grue, a scullery maid.  Together, this motley group travels to the castle of King Haggard where they believe the Red Bull has imprisoned all the other unicorns of the world.  All does not go as planned, of course, and adventure follows.<br />I think many people make the mistake of thinking The Last Unicorn is exclusively a children's book.  Nothing could be further from the truth as this beautiful, little tale can be read on many levels:  as an adventure story or as an exploration of the nature of truth, beauty, reality, immortality and the ultimate purpose of life.<br />Of all the fantasy books I have ever read, this is my alltime favorite and the one I find most beautiful as well as possessing the most depth and emotion.  It is a lovely tale that brings the secrets of life and love into wonderful focus.	2002-02-11

No, are aren't undying literature, but sometimes undying literature is just not what I want.

This is a coming-of-age story as we follow Jacob from the rocky coasts of Cornwall to the sun-drenched shores of Greece.<br />Anyone looking for a conventional story or plot won't find it here.  Jacob's Room is Virginia Woolf during a highly experimental stage; a stage during which she was developing her pure stream-of-consciousness style.<br />Jacob's Room is for very &quot;literary&quot; readers.  This is definitely not light and fluffy and it's definitely not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  Those who love good literature, however, will find Jacob's Room a pure poetic masterpiece of the highest order.	2002-01-29

Although some readers might find all the detail of police procedure, Vienna, Viennese life and Hungarian folklore just &quot;too much,&quot; I adored it and thought it added much to the story's atmosphere.<br />The author almost created a &quot;gem&quot; with the character of Erszebet.  I say &quot;almost&quot; because Shields really doesn't let us get to know Erszebet, she never makes us privy to her deepest thoughts and emotions and so we're kept at arm's length.  I really wanted to get to know this fascinating woman (the best thing about this book), but Shields just wouldn't let me.<br />Although the character development left a little to be desired, plot is where this book really falls short.  It is very slow-paced, but that, in itself, didn't bother me one bit.  What did, was the fact that we're often led in one direction without ever knowing why in the world we're headed there...or why we change course when we do.  The ending of the book is a complete letdown.  The identity of the killer was obvious almost from the beginning of the book, but even this wouldn't have been so bad had Shields not set us up for something she never delivers, then left so many loose threads dangling.<br />While The Fig Eater is a classy and intelligent narrarive (hence, my four-stars), the author's superb prose style simply can't make up for her less-than-satisfying storytelling skills.  Jody Shields is a wonderful writer, however, and I wouldn't hesitate to give her one more try, especially if she creates a book with the fascinating Erszebet as the central character.  This book was entertaining even if it did, in the final analysis, fail to satisfy completely.	2002-01-29

Perhaps it is both.<br />The book may scare the daylights out of you, but the story never lags.  On the contrary, it picks up pace as it evolves toward an inevitable, though not predictable, ending.<br />Although Juan Rulfo wrote many short stories, Pedro Paramo is his only novel.  It is definitely a masterpiece and definitely one of a very different order.  Pedro Paramo may shock you, horrify you or leave you feeling bewildered, but it will certainly be a completely different story from anything you've ever read before.	2002-01-29

It is also the most captivating and masterful modern epic ever told.  And it is an epic; it details the history of a people, in this case, the Buendias, the most important and influential family in Macondo.  In fact, the Buendias serve as a metaphor for the development of Latin America since its independence.  The book follows the Buendias through the founding, development and decay of their settlement in the jungle.  Readers with some knowledge of Latin American history will easily recognize the development of Colombia in the book.  The civil wars in the novel parallel the civil wars in Colombia from 1885-1902, and Colonel Aureliano can be seen as modeled after General Rafael Uribe Uribe.  In fact, Gabriel Garcia Marquez' grandfather, himself, fought under Uribe.  A knowledge of Latin American politics, however, is not necessary to enjoy and love this wonderful book.  In fact, many readers see no political implications in the book.<br />There is a wonderful mix of the comic and the melancholy in this story.  We meet characters who do the most delightful, or the most absurd things, and yet there is an undeniable strain of futility and sadness that runs throughout the entire book.  Macondo is definitely a magical place and early in the book we come to expect the unexpected, to expect to be surprised, to accept the unbelievable.  In fact, we have to ask ourselves if Macondo is real or if it is just a state of mind.  Perhaps it is both.  It is this intermingling of the factual and the fantastic that, to me, makes this book so special and marks Garcia Marquez' genius.  The Buendia men, especially, are in possession of truly fecund imaginations and they use them in the most disconcerting ways.<br />For all the wonder and beauty and fantasy in this story, this is ultimately a sad and tragic book.  It deals, after all, with the failure of a town and its people, people who despite their amazing vitality and wit, are each immersed in a solitude from which they find it impossible to extricate themselves.<br />If one looks closely at the Buendias, he can see that most symbolize a particular historical period.  The founder of Macondo and patriarch of the family, Jose Arcadio, is a true Renaissance man.  His son, Aureliano is a legendary military leader.  Aureliano Segundo becomes a sort-of farmer while his twin brother, Jose Arcadio Segundo becomes a radical labor leader.<br />The Buendias, however, seem to live their lives in a circular fashion.  Their personalities constantly repeat the personalities of earlier generations and this repetition often has much to do with the name a child is given.  The Aurelianos are all quiet and withdrawn, but prone to success, while the Jose Arcadios are energetic and enterprising but seemingly doomed to failure.<br />One Hundred Years of Solitude, however, is not a psychological novel.  All of the characters are rather two-dimensional and serve to carry out thematic points.  The men are obsessive, intelligent and energetic.  The Aurelianos are involved with ambition, while the Jose Arcadios are filled with earthy passion.  Among the women, the Ursulas are stern while the Remedios are eternally immature.  But, while the men are dreamers, the women remain anchored in reality.  This may be a small part of Garcia Marquez' view of life in Latin America.<br />The Buendia men have everything needed to be happy and successful and yet each ultimately fails, withdrawing into a frustrated loneliness or solitude, but not just any solitude.  The Buendia men choose to be solitary, rather than having solitariness imposed upon them, they choose to accept the ultimate futility of their lives, and they know this solitude will be repeated in futuregenerations.<br />Some readers have said they cannot keep all the characters straight and the Buendia family tree is a twisted one, indeed.  In fact, the final generation of Buendias really can't figure out where they stand in relation to each other and to their ancestors.  This alone should tell us that Macondo is fated to end.<br />On the surface, Macondo is fated to die when someone deciphers Melquiades' (the gypsy's) manuscript and learns the full history of Macondo.  In reality, Macondo dies because its inhabitants simply don't choose to continue.  Instead, they choose fantasy, solitude and a withdrawal from life.  A piece of Macondo, and thus a shred of hope, does survive however, when the author, himself, takes the advice of the Catalan bookseller and leaves the town before its destruction.  Thus, there does exist an ongoing testimony of the life that had been lived there.  And what book does Garcia Marquez escape with?  A volume of Rabelais, one the world's greatest comic geniuses.  Perhaps, in this enigmatic ending, Garcia Marquez is telling all Latin Americans to be different from the Buendias, to learn to laugh at themselves, to learn from their mistakes, to be amenable to change and to stop repeating destructive patterns.	2002-01-18

Kay covers everything from warfare to social mores to politics to love relationships and more.  Emotions run the gamut from love to betrayal to hatred, however, the dominant emotion in this book is pain.  These characters are people who have lost everything and are experiencing the resultant anguish and despair.<br />Tigana takes place on a mythical peninsula known as the Palm.  The Palm has been destroyed by two invading armies, one from the east, led by the Barbadian sorcerer, Alberico and one from the west, led by the Ygrathen sorcerer king, Brandin.  There are nine provinces in the Palm and each invader has conquered eight.  The ninth, Tigana, remains neutral, however, as the book opens, Brandin is close to conquering it as well.  Brandin does have a bone to pick with Tigana and its people.  Some years before, the Prince of Tigana killed Brandin's son in battle and Brandin has vowed revenge.  He destroys most of Tigana and then casts a dreadful curse upon the land and its people.  If all that seems interesting to you, consider the fact that that is just the Prologue.<br />The main storyline of the book occurs some twenty years later as the two invaders (and sorcerers) have reached a seeming stalemate.  Although the inhabitants of Tigana have lost everything, some of them do manage to rally around Alessan, a charismatic resistance fighter who just happens to be the son of the former Prince of Tigana (the one who killed the son of Brandin).  <br />Alessan is fighting for a greater good, however, and he wants to remove not only Brandin, but Ygrathen as well.  Don't expect any bloody battlefield scenes in this book; Kay is a much more subtle writer and the typical revenge storyline of good versus evil doesn't take place in the usual way.  This is one of the hallmarks of Kay's writing and something that marks him as a writer or superior fantasy.  He simply doesn't need bloody battlefield cliches to enrich his book.  His stories weave their magic through muted complexity instead, something that should greatly please the mature and discriminating reader.<br />Tigana is not Alessan's story alone.  Kay alternates Alessan's point-of-view with that of a fascinating woman named Dianora who bears much of the pain existing in the book.  Having survived the destruction of Tigana, Dianora has made a personal vow to kill Brandin herself.  To reach this end, she becomes a member of Brandin's harem and unwittingly becomes not only his lover, but his trusted friend as well.  But don't believe this is all there is to Dianora.  Kay is much too good a writer for that to happen.<br />Kay has peopled Tigana with a large cast of characters and each is both memorable and distinct.  Especially interesting is the wizard, the Duke Sandre.  The manner of the Duke's entry into the story of Tigana is simply a masterpiece in miniature.<br />Everything in Tigana is fantasy, yet everything in Tigana seems as though it could have really happened.  Much standard fantasy fare exists, it is true, but Kay goes much, much further and creates characters and a world that we can really believe in.  In short, this is fantasy writing of the highest order.  You really can't do much better than the anguised and beautiful world of Tigana.	2002-01-18
US	38577070	R2V350BPPTCUJW	0192834118	187016080	The Idiot (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	5	29	31	N	N	Profound, Timeless Relevance	The Idiot is often unfairly compared to Dostoyevsky's other masterpieces and, even though The Idiot usually comes out on the short end of any comparison, it is certainly my favorite.  Although the narrative of The Idiot may ramble more than do some of Dostoyevsky's other books, I feel it is ultimately more profound.<br />At its core, The Idiot is a character/society study although it also encompasses many religious and political aspects as well.  The central character, Prince Myshkin, provides the contrast for all the other characters and is definitely a &quot;Christ-like&quot; figure, a man who embodies most perfectly the Christian ideals of selflessness and love.<br />Prince Myshkin is a man who has suffered from mental illness since childhood.  This illness has the curious effect of causing him to respond from his heart rather than from his head.  In addition, Myshkin also suffers from a form of epilepsy that causes him to launch into tirades regarding the social ills of the day.  As a Christ-like figure, Myshkin is in direct contrast to the other characters in the book who are all worldly and sophisticated, though somewhat cynical, aristocrats.  Myshkin's extreme goodness also causes him to become entangled in various political and personal intrigues.<br />Although completely good, Prince Myshkin in a fully realized character.  One of the marvels of this novel is that Dostoyevsky managed to present Myshkin as a serious, rather than a comic, character.  His goodness is not something we want to laugh at.  There are many comic moments in the book, however, and most of them are provided through various financial and romantic entanglements.<br />Although Prince Myshkin is the thread that links all the characters and aspects in the novel, he is not the only fully realized character; the others are also extremely well drawn.  Dostoyevsky was fond of using real life incidents in his books and his notes tells us this is something he did in creating the characters that populate this book.<br />Ultimately, The Idiot is a tragic book.  Politically, it ridicules the shallow ideals of the Russian aristocracy, and, while Prince Myshkin's ramblings may seem comic, they are actually harsh criticism.<br />Prince Myshkin was more than &quot;a positively good man.&quot;  He was a man who could see into the future and know what lay in store.  Dostoyevsky's deep insight into the character of man makes The Idiot one of literature's most profound and timeless works.	2002-01-17

For sheer narrative prose power, this book may be the best thing I've read...ever.  But, as superlative as the writing is, it's easy to tell this is one of McCarthy's very early works.  Although the book is powerful and haunting in theme and symbolism, it comes up wanting in both plot and characterization.<br />McCarthy never really lets us get to know his characters or the fears and desires that drive them and that keeps us distanced from them.  Sometimes this distancing works to a writer's advantage, but I think The Outer Dark would definitely have been improved had we been allowed to know the characters a bit better.<br />Plot is where this book really falls apart.  Where McCarthy's later books are seamlessly plotted, The Outer Dark contains some jarring jumps and omissions in the storyline that can leave the more discriminating reader in the lurch.<br />Cormac McCarthy long ago evolved into one of America's finest writers ever.  As such, The Outer Dark is a book well worth reading, but if you're new to McCarthy, I'd read his later works first, then backtrack.  The final analysis:  more than a little jerky, but well worth anyone's time.	2002-01-17

However, one thing The Rose Grower lacks is a clear and compelling storyline.  <br />All through the reading of this lovely book I kept asking myself:  &quot;What is the story question around which this book revolves?&quot;  Well, there isn't one, and without a story question, there is no story.  This is not a novel; it's 323 pages of lovely prose.  The problem is, lovely prose does not make a book.<br />In the hands of a skilled writer, plot can often take a backseat to other literary devices.  The Rose Grower, however, contains no such devices.  Neither is it a character study.  In fact, the author forces us to keep our distance from all of the characters, making it difficult to know them or care about their fate.  The ending is particularly dismal.  What little emotion and hope this book does contain is invested in the characters of Sophie and Joseph and De Krester sets us up for something she never delivers.<br />And what about that title?  De Krester never lets us experience Sophie (the rose grower) as she struggles in her garden.  We know nothing of her hopes or frustrations.  I was as puzzled by this as I was annoyed.<br />In the Rose Grower, De Krester writes extremely beautiful prose.  She also begins her book with an unforgettable image, yet she fails to develop that image.  She definitely has the skeleton of a lovely and touching story; one she simply failed to develop.  I felt like I was reading an outline; nothing was fleshed-out.  De Krester seemed to be afraid to write the big scenes, the dramatic set-pieces.<br />De Krester's mistakes are common among new writers and they are easily corrected once recognized.  Any editor or even first reader should have spotted them immediately and worked with De Krester to correct them.  It's a shame they didn't; De Krester is talented,but both she and her readers were cheated out of what could have been a fascinating and poignant book.	2002-01-17

Barry Unsworth's prose is perfect and he does a wonderful job of bringing 14th century England to life.  While the descriptions of winter are particularly good, I found all the description to be so real and so evocative, yet never intrusive.  In Morality Play, Unsworth performs a perfect balancing act:  characterization, setting, plot, theme...all are given their perfect weight.<br />Morality Play is a mystery, but it is one with a complex and thoughtful plot rather than one that races ahead at a breakneck pace.  This doesn't slow the book down.  Far from it; the book's perfect pacing only enriches and deepens both the story and the characters.<br />Morality Play is really a perfect novel:  a surprising murder mystery, engrossing historical fiction and a book that delves into the very beginnings of modern theatre.  It's perfect for anyone who loves England, loves historical fiction, mysteries or theatre.	2002-01-17

I resent it for stealing so much of my time and for promising so much, then delivering so little.  I'll be fair; usually I loathe mysteries, but An Instance of the Fingerpost isn't really a mystery as much as it's an exploration of the meaning of truth, and, on that level at least, I think it succeeds.<br />Each of the narrators of An Instance of the Fingerpost is concerned with the same story, yet each narrative is strikingly different.  The individuals concerned choose to concentrate on different aspects; to assign to themselves more importance then what they are due; to tell their story in the direction best benefitting themselves.  Although objective truth certainly does exist, we have to ask ourselves if any one of us is truly capable of seeing it, or, is truth always colored by our own objective interpretation?<br />It's obvious that Pears did much meticulous research regarding this book.  Being a lover of historical fiction, I appreciate that.  I found the interpretations fascinating, both individually and collectively.  So, where's the problem?  Why do I resent this book so much?<br />As I said, An Instance of the Fingerpost is primarily a study of truth, however, it is also a story, a murder mystery to be more precise, and I think Pears lets us down abdominally in the end.  The resolution of this story, and its ultimate truth are so far-fetched they're laughable.  I wasn't laughing, however, when I read the baloney Pears attempts to force us to swallow.  After the initial shock, my only reaction was that surely Pears could have thought of a better ending!  Surely, we didn't read the whole book just to be let down in that way.  It took a few minutes for me to realize that yes, that's exactly what we did.<br />If you can put up with a trite and unbelievable ending, the rest of this book isn't too bad.  Just don't say you weren't warned.	2002-01-17

All the weaknesses and faults Flaubert ascribed to Emma when he created her are still just as recognizable now as they were in 1856.  I'm sure many women see aspects of Emma in themselves today, just as they did in the 19th century.  While Emma Bovary may be an unconventional literary heroine, I think she's unforgettable, in part, because she really is so completely human.<br />Emma Rouault is a lovable woman, but she certainly has her flaws.  When she leaves her father to marry Charles Bovary and live in the small country village of Yonville l'Abbaye, these faults come to light in a very glaring way.  Charles is a good man, but emotionally he's rather cold as well as being a very insignificant doctor.  Emma, who fills much of her time with the reading of sentimental romance novels, soon finds Charles dull and impoverished.  She's come to believe that true love must encompass gallantry, high romance and constant infatuation.<br />Convent educated, Emma is pious and devout even though she feels herself attracted to a man she finds more exciting than Charles, a man she feels will finally fulfill all her frivolous desires and more (exactly what she felt about Charles before she married him).  How Emma Bovary comes to grips with her conflicting emotions forms the basis for this story.<br />Madame Bovary is a book that can seem to move along at a snail's pace.  The more sophisticated reader will find this gradual buildup a joy; the &quot;thoroughly modern&quot; reader may, sadly, find the book too slow.  Flaubert's writing sparkles, however, and it's easy to find yourself engrossed in the story.<br />Although many people find several symbolic references in Madame Bovary, Flaubert, himself, denied that the book had any meaning beyond being a thoroughly engrossing story.<br />Madame Bovary is one of my ten alltime favorite books and I reread it on an almost yearly basis.  I believe &quot;the proof is in the pudding.&quot;  Emma Bovary is still as luscious as she was 146 years ago.  That says a lot for any woman...or any book.ltime favorite books and I reread it on an almost yearly basis.

However, the part it captures is perfect.  In this book, Aurelio Zen is...Aurelio Zen, and he's even more human and fallible than in the six books preceding.<br />Michael Dibdin is certainly a prose master and Blood Rain is a wonderful showcase of that prose.  The writing is as smooth as silk and every word and nuance seems to be perfectly placed.<br />While Blood Rain is a wonderful character study of Aurelio Zen, I didn't find it a very suspenseful mystery.  In fact, the central mystery in the book seemed to take a definite backseat to the study of Zen.  I kept asking myself, &quot;Okay, so when is Dibdin going to write about that body found in the railroad car?  And what's it got to do with anything?&quot;  I found I had to deduct one star for the thin and not very suspenseful plot, but Blood Rain is still a wonderful book that is also highly atmospheric and one that lovers of Italy will adore.	2002-01-17

While Time and Again does contain numerous instances of time travel, it is definitely not science fiction.  And this is okay.  Even if Finney had written the book today, I doubt that he'd change a thing.  Time and Again is timeless, a real classic.  And, it's a classic that's fun.<br />I'm not a New Yorker and not at all familiar with most of the places Si visits and talks about in the novel, but it was enormous fun reading about them, both &quot;then&quot; and &quot;now.&quot;  The fact that the book is, for the most part, historically accurate, only added to my enjoyment.<br />I do have one bone to pick with Finney and it concerns the abrupt manner in which Si handled his relationship with Kate.  It seemed quite out of character to me.<br />Time and Again is a book to be read when you want to be entertained but you really don't want to think too much.

As an adult, I have found very few books of &quot;adult fantasy&quot; that really hold my interest, but Datlow and Windling's Adult Fairy Tale Series is something special.<br />Snow White, Blood Red is a volume of about twenty fairy tales, reworked by some of the best writers in the fantasy, science fiction and horror genres.  In fact, there are times when more than one writer will give his or her own unique version of an old fairy tale, making this book all the more special and unique.<br />I think the introductions by Datlow and Windling only serve to enrich the book and make it all the more special.  In &quot;White as Snow,&quot; Windling discusses fairy tales in general in terms of the fantasy element; in &quot;Red as Blood,&quot; Datlow writes about the horror elements so often found in stories of this type.<br />There are many styles, voices and styles represented in this book, so I feel there is definitely something here for everyone.  In &quot;The Moon is Drowning While I Sleep,&quot; Charles de Lint weaves elements of an old English folk tale into a mythical and magical city as he explores the boundaries of dreams and reality (which are not so distinct as one might think).  I found &quot;The Frog Prince,&quot; (which deals with Freud and a frog) and &quot;Stalking Beans&quot; to contain elements of humor as well as fantasy.  &quot;Snow-Drop&quot; is a wonderful retelling of the story of Snow White, while &quot;Persimmon&quot; retells the story of Thumbelina, but this time, with a lot more wit.<br />There are two retellings of the stories of both Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel, and while both provide new and unique subject matter, both retain much from the original story, all to their credit.  I especially liked Neil Gaiman's retelling of The Three Billy Goats Gruff in &quot;The Troll Bridge.&quot;  This is a dark, haunting and melancholy piece that shouldmake any reader feel more than a touch wistful for times gone by.<br />Not all of the stories are wistful or beautiful, though.  Some do explore the darker aspects of the fairy tales most of us grew to love as children.  &quot;Puss,&quot; a retelling of the Puss in Boots story is one of them.  I didn't really like this rather gruesome tale, but it does serve to round out the anthology.<br />The most beautiful story, by far, however, is a modern retelling of &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; by Patricia McKillip.  This story alone makes the volume well worth owning.<br />It is obvious that Datlow and Windling set very high standards in deciding which stories to use in this volume and this is not a book for unsophisticated readers.  While there were one or two stories I didn't particularly like and probably won't reread, I can't deny that they are all very well-written and present new ideas and perspectives on old fairy and folk tales.<br />If you're an adult who simply can't get your fill of fairy tales, I would highly recommend this anthology.  The writing is first-rate, the authors have remained true to the essence of the original tale while bringing us a fresh, new perspective and the stories, in and of themselves, are just plain good.  All in all, a wonderful book.	2002-01-12

It sounded magnificent:  a secluded castle at the foot of the Carpathians, a beautiful woman long dead, a secret about to be revealed.  I was sadly disappointed.<br />Instead of taking us back to the past and dramatizing in scenes what could have been a wonderfully engrossing story, Sandor Marai (no relation!) keeps us firmly anchored in the present where one character delivers a book-length monologue to a second character, informing this second character of what he already knows for the benefit of the reader.  Surely this method of storytelling was already dated in Marai's day.  Why he chose to employ it is beyond me.<br />I'm not a fan of flashbacks, but, in my opinion at least, this story would have been greatly enriched through the use of a frame.  In a frame, we begin in the present, then return to the past for the body of the story, and finally wind up in the present once again for the conclusion.<br />The use of a frame also would have allowed us to get to know all three main characters:  Henrik, Konrad and Krisztina.  As it is, the fascinating Krisztina is long dead when the story begins and Konrad barely gets to utter ten words.  The bulk of the book is taken up with Henrik's rambling, and sometimes dull, monologue.  Had we been allowed to know all three characters, to experience their needs and emotions, the book would have come to life, the story would have been transformed.<br />I do have to give credit where credit is due:  there are some very lovely set-pieces and Konrad certainly has more patience than I.  I would have said, Jó éjszakát! (Goodnight! in Hungarian) after an hour of Henrik's tirade; poor Konrad endured it the whole night long.<br />Marai has taken a magnificent idea and deprived it of all story tension, characterization and surprise.  I just don't feel it was a very good choice.	2002-01-12

Luckily, I spent four years at college in the Eastern United States, so I can really understand Hynes' characters and their dilemmas.<br />You can't get much more cynical than Hynes does in The Lecturer's Tale.  This book is, by turns, dark, delirious, hilarious and wicked.  The protagonist is mild-mannered Nelson Humboldt, a visiting assistant professor in English at &quot;Midwest University.&quot;  When it comes to career choices, Nelson proved to be the ultimate fence sitter, straddling poststructuralism on the one side and traditionalism on the other.  Nelson's days of fence sitting, however, are about to come to an end.<br />At Midwest, Nelson loves to spend his time sitting in the library's old clock tower (read Ivory Tower) where the university chooses to keep all the novels by &quot;dead, white males.&quot;  He keeps rereading and reresearching books and articles he knows he will never publish, although he chooses not to face that fact--just yet.<br />After being unceremoniously fired, by a female no less, Nelson is involved in a freak accident under the clock tower in which his right index finger is severed.  Once it is reattached, Nelson makes the grand discovery that it (and thus he) have the power to make others do exactly as he wishes.  Nelson beings to plot the very thing he thinks he wishes for the most--his return (in a blaze of glory) to &quot;Midwest.&quot;<br />I think Hynes blames some of Nelson's problems on feminism.  It is no accident that the book's two leading female protagonists have names that begin with the letter &quot;V,&quot; Victoria Victorinix and Vita (whose very name means &quot;life&quot;), a strong proponent of gender theory whose own gender can certainly be called into question.  It is also no mistake that the new library, the library where all the modern theorists are housed, is shaped in the form of a large letter &quot;V.&quot;  In fact, Nelson likes tocontemplate this V-shaped annex, but only when safely tucked away in the ivory citadel of the old clock tower.<br />Does Nelson get what he wants?  Sort of.  Sort of, yes and sort of, no.  Let's just say that when he wins, it is not traditionalism that produces his victories and when he loses, it is not poststructuralism that produces his loss.  There is yet another evil on the horizon, one that Nelson never counted on battling.  Ultimately, Nelson gets what Nelson deserves.<br />Those who thought Hynes let his readers down with the ending probably haven't spent much time in English or Comparative Literature Departments.  The ending is absolutely perfect and epitomizes just what is going on in universities all across the United States today.  If you love the book, but just don't understand the end, ask an English major.  This is really too good to miss.<br />Hynes' writing is a delight.  This is real satire, dark and cynical, but hilarious, too.  I found myself laughing uproariously at the thought of all my former literature professors scowling at the recognition of themselves in Hynes' characters.<br />If you love satire, black comedy, or have any familiarity at all with university life, read The Lecturer's Tale.  It really doesn't get any better than this.	2002-01-12

All of her books are superb and Master Georgie, her third book of historical fiction, is different, but no less superb, than the two preceeding.  I think Master Georgie has not been praised quite highly enough because its subject matter may be less familiar to Americans than Bainbridge's two previous historicals.  As a European, however, Master Georgie is definitely my favorite.  It is quieter and more subtle, but I think it has much more emotional depth.<br />Bainbridge is always a little cryptic with her subject matter and Master Georgie is no exception.  Don't let this put you off the book, though--the undercurrents of energy and intrigue make this short book riveting and well worth anyone's time.<br />The protagonist, Master Georgie, is actually George Hardy, a Victorian English dissolute and surgeon who, one day, decides to pack up his family and head for Turkey.  Although his intentions are to provide medical care to the wounded during the Crimean war, we all know things rarely go as planned.  Suffice it to say that Murphy's Law holds just as true for Master Georgie as it does for us.<br />The battlefield scenes are some of the best I have ever read, not surprising with Bainbridge.  Although the scenes are brutal and sometimes even gruesome, this marvelous author has managed to infuse them with a sardonic wit that rivals anything I have ever read.  Bainbridge is true to her subject matter in these scenes.  Bainbridge chooses to forgo romanticism in favor of the reality of confusion and futility that surely must have existed on the battlefields of the Crimea.  Lest you think she's making fun of her subjects, let me tell you she most assuredly is not.  She is compassionate, but she wisely keeps that compassion from coloring the facts.  I think she is simply interpreting events with her own brand of intelligence and irony.  <br />Master Georgie can meander at times, but Bainbridge has even this meandering under complete control.  She also tempers it with vivid details.  We really feel as if we are reading an actual eyewitness account to the war.<br />Master Georgie is a short book, really more of a novella than a novel, and you can easily read it in one sitting if you so desire.  Don't let its length fool you, though.  Master Georgie is a dark book and one that really packs a punch.  It is stylish, sophisticated and sardonic.  In short, it is a book that is worthy of all the praise it has garnered.	2002-01-09

Things are not quite what Peter expected, however, and he is more than surprised when he learns the king requires his orchestra to perform in a freezing cellar, among a group of squawking hens, while the orchestra's exquisite music floats up to the Vinterstue via a series of trapdoors and pipes.<br />Although Peter Claire is the central figure in this novel, there are many others whose stories are no less important.  One of these stories belongs to Kirsten Munk, wife of Christian IV and the &quot;almost Queen&quot; of Denmark.  Kirsten despises music and chooses to spend her time either dreaming of the Swedish Count Otto or frolicking with him, whichever the case may be.<br />Kirsten's favorite lady-in-waiting, Emilia Tilsen, also plays a very important role in this magical book, for Emilia Tilsen and Peter Claire fall in love at first sight on the grounds of Rosenborg, the palace that Christian built for his unfaithful wife.  But will Peter's and Emilia's love be allowed to blossom or will it wither on the vine?  When the adulterous Kirsten is banished from court, she takes Emilia with her, thus jeopardizing the young girl's future happiness with the English lute player.<br />Music and Silence is also the story of the beautiful Irish countess, Francesca O'Fingal, a Bologna-born Italian beauty whose husband, Johnny, is the subject of a metaphorical subplot.  We learn his story from Francesca via her notebook, aptly named, &quot;La Dolorossa.&quot;  And, if this isn't magic enough, Francesca and Johnny both have a connection to Peter Claire.<br />And then there is Marcus Tilsen, Emilia's five year old brother, a fey imp of a child whose thoughts are &quot;plucked from the air&quot; and who seems to possess magical powers, powers that will one day be needed to save the life of Peter Claire.<br />If these fascinating characters are not enough to keep any reader thoroughly engrossed, we also learn the story of Emilia's father, Johann and his second wife, Magdelena, a bewitching woman who has learned to use her wiles well, but never wisely.  Another wonderful character is Christian's mother, the miserly Queen Sofie, a woman whose antics lend much comedic lightness to this gorgeous tale.<br />Tremain is a master storyteller and a master at characterization.  We really come to know each character through the author's skillful first-person narration.  While each one occupies a special place in our thoughts, it is Peter Claire who stands at the center, the connecting point from which all the other stories radiate.<br />While some of these characters are more good than bad, and others more bad than good, none are without both virtues and vices, something that only endears them to us.  The Dowager Queen Sofie may be a miser, but she is a comic one.  Kirsten may be selfish and self-centered, but she, too, has moments when she finds it in her heart to love unselfishly.<br />Music and Silence is a lavish feast of a novel set against the fascinating historical background of 17th century Denmark.  It encompasses characters of tremendous depth and a wide range of emotion.  Tremain's writing is absolutely flawless; the smallest detail is given as much love and attention as is the largest set piece.  This elegant and stylish book is an unparalleled accomplishment for Rose Tremain and an unparalleled treat for any sophistical reader.  No one could ask for more.	2002-01-06

On the surface, that doesn't seem bad, but sometimes a book can be so simple and straightforward, so lacking in artifice, that, as a result, the story all but disappears.  Such is the case with The Earthquake Bird.<br />While the ending of this book comes as no surprise (the author telegraphs it loud and clear on page 19), the events leading up to that ending simply do not follow the law of cause and effect.  Instead, they are a series of ho-hum, random events, much like seed thrown into the wind, scattering wherever it may fall.<br />The characters, too, are problematic.  None are the slightest bit likable.  This would be fine if The Earthquake Bird were satire or farce, but this is a dark book that is meant to be taken quite seriously.<br />All three main characters are quirky and eccentric, yet they often adopt the most conventional and genteel behaviors.  The protagonist, in particular, acts in ways that only make her seem at odds with herself.  Her actions simply do not fit the personality given to her by the author.  And let's face it--characters do not take over the writing of books for the author.  Either an author has control or he (in this case, she) does not.  Many times, we simply have to shake our head in disbelief while muttering, &quot;Lucy would never do that!&quot;<br />On the plus side, I did get a real sense of modern-day Tokyo, but this certainly wasn't enough to overcome the book's glaring deficiencies.  Some authors are so good and so experienced they can get away with the dispensation of conventional plotting and characterization, conventional cause and effect sequence of events.  This author isn't among their number.  At least not yet.<br />Given the lack of plot, the poor characterization and the telegraphed ending, we're not left with much.  The only thing I can say about The Earthquake Bird at this point is that it is a waste of paper and a waste of any intelligent reader's time.	2002-01-06

Galois was a brilliant French mathematician, who may or may not have suffered from some form of epilepsy or depression and who, sadly, was killed under mysterious circumstances at the young age of twenty.<br />Galois' life is cloaked in mystery.  We do know that he dreamed of solving the quintic, a complex mathematical equation that had eluded all the best minds of his time.  He was the first person to formulate the concept of a finite group theory and then to apply this theory to solve one of the major mathematical problems of his era.<br />Although Galois seemed to live for pure mathematics and pure mathematics alone, he mysteriously gave up his feverish study to devote most of his time to the revolution that took place in France in 1830.  Why Galois, who seemingly had little interest in politics, would brandish a knife and threaten the king, in front of Alexandre Dumas, no less, forms the basis for much of this book.<br />In this book, we learn of a most important letter Galois wrote on the night of May 29, 1832 to his friend, Auguste Chevalier.  What we don't learn about, and what has been lost to history, are Galois' other manuscripts and, most interestingly, his brief love affair with Stéphanie du Motel.  We also know that Galois fully expected to die when he did, but what we don't know is why he died or why, precisely, he expected his death to come about exactly as it did.<br />You certainly don't have to be a mathematician to love this book.  You really don't even need much of an interest in math.  Galois is such a compelling character that he makes a wonderful character study no matter what he was interested in.  This book, aimed at the general reader, does not dwell unnecessarily on mathematical concepts and even when it does, it does so in such a way that it only adds beauty to the narrative and depth to the character of Galois.<br />Petsinis seems much more interested in capturing the psychological essence of Galois than in cataloging his mathematical and political conquests and, in my opinion, he succeeds wonderfully.  This is a beautiful book and one that is a joy to read.  Petsinis worked a seeming miracle in weaving the actual events in the life of Galois into his fictional narrative.  We are left with nothing but the belief that Petsinis' Galois is the real Galois; that these were his thoughts and his feelings and his reasons for being.<br />Galois struggled with his emotions for most of his twenty years and Petsinis lets us feel this struggle.  For example, Galois, even though being mesmerized by the enchanting du Motel, had an intrinsic aversion to both sex and romance.  He was a genius par excellence, yet he was a dreamer as well, and sometimes this dreaminess would cause him to slip from the factual world of the mathematics he loved into a horrific fantasy world of which he wanted no part.<br />The life of Evariste Galois makes for a very difficult character study, but Petsinis has done a marvelous job.  The French Mathematician is one of the most gorgeous books I have ever read and it makes one of the world's true geniuses so much more accessible.  Evariste Galois led a grand but tragic life and Petsinis captures it in all its glory in this lyrical and beautifully written book.	2002-01-05
US	38577070	RKYAJ2XIXIOLY	0385240899	68237838	The Floating Opera and The End of the Road	Books	5	21	22	N	N	The Satire of a Genius	...John Barth is, without a doubt, a brilliant, witty, creative and original writer.  Sometimes he is just too  brilliant and original for most of the book buying public.  Happily, this isn't the case with his first two books, The Floating Opera and The End of the Road.<br />Both The Floating Opera and The End of the Road concern love triangles of sorts, but each is developed in quite a different manner.  While The Floating Opera is funny and rather light, The End of the Road is black comedy of the highest order, and in my opinion at least, it is the far superior book.  I think it showcases Barth's genius in marvelous ways, with characterization and dialogue being two of the best.  In both books, however, Barth is so dead-on with his artifice and eccentricity that we have to laugh at our own recognition of ourselves, reflected in his twisted characters and their strange goings-on.<br />In both books, Barth's characters seem to be searching for something, though what they are searching for is not made exactly clear.  It could be good vs. evil, love vs. hate, war vs. peace, yet ultimately, after each character becomes ensnared in a mesh of confusion and confabulation from which he or she seems unable to extricate himself, the search is narrowed to the simple meaning of existence (or non-existence as the case may be).  There are no absolutes in either book, making them all the more confusing for some, but all the more enjoyable for others.<br />Barth, himself, seems to be an author whose message is simple--the world is going straight to hell and we are going with it, so why not have a laugh on ourselves now and then?  There really isn't much else to do.<br />I am afraid this review has not done The Floating Opera and The End of the Road justice, but how does an ordinary reader do justice to genius such as Barth's?  I recommend all intelligent readers to buy this book, read it, enjoy it, savor it.  Laugh at yourself as you laugh at Barth's characters.  Just sit back andenjoy the ride.  After all, there isn't much else to do.	2002-01-05
