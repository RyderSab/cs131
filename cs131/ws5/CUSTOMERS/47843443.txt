OUT OF BOUNDS IS THE BEST SPORTS BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!! <br /> Most sports books are lousy. Larry Bird's DRIVE was boring, Bill Walton's NOTHING BUT NET had a few good stories but didn't tell me any of the stuff I really wanted to hear, and the books about superstars like David Beckham are usually books designed to make them seem like picture perfect family man who just happen to look like they're wild and crazy! But OUT OF BOUNDS is different! <br />  <br /> I've been following the NBA since 1973, and so I couldn't resist looking at Jeff Benedict's OUT OF BOUNDS, when I saw that it was about the NBA players and crime. I'd always wondered what exactly Ruben Patterson had done, and Jeff Benedict does a terrific job of researching Patterson's criminal history. Patterson, the self proclaimed &quot;Kobe Stopper,&quot; sodomized his 16 year old nanny, beat his wife, and Benedict goes on to tell about many other NBA players who did similar things, and along the way he destroys the myths that the victims are groupies or women after players, and so on. (The stuff about the groupies never made sense to me anyhow, how many women are really pro basketball fans???) <br />  <br /> OUT OF BOUNDS is like a Mickey Spillane novel, with lots of names, locations, dates, and a terrific writing style that keeps you wanting to go to the next page! Jeff Benedict has changed the way I view NBA players--and all other pro athletes--forever! <br /> The other two great sports books I love are Dennis Rodman's BAD AS I WANNA BE and THE SELLING OF THE GREEN--the real story of the Boston Celtics--but OUT OF BOUNDS IS THE BEST SPORTS BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!! <br />  <br /> Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING <br />	2004-08-01

WHY MEN DON'T HAVE A CLUE AND WOMEN ALWAYS NEED MORE SHOES is better than most dating books because writers Barbara and Allan Pease did a lot of research before they wrote it.  The best parts of the book are the sections where they post results of their studies about what physical characteristics attract the opposite sex.   The only flaw in their list is when they rate faces as being less important than physiques, when scientific research has concluded the opposite.  (See Nancy Etcoff's SURVIVAL OF THE PRETTIEST.)  Mr. and Mrs. Pease then lose all their remaining credibility when then say people choose personality as being more important than looks, which isn't supported by scientific studies.<br />This is an entertaining book because of the way its put together, with lots of practical research about how to impress people by improving your appearance and habits.   <br />Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING	2004-04-27

Well, for starters, the two writers go the extra mile to talk about A thorough health program, not just what's wrong with eating grain, and include lots of pointers on how to live better, like with pointers about how to sleep better at night--restrict outside light!!!--and Mercola and Levy hit home with anybody who's ever drank soda or fruit juice when they go on an all out assault on sugar, which is targeted as THE ENEMY!!! THE NO-GRAIN DIET makes it simple:avoid eating foods that can easily be converted into sugar, and avoid sugar, and you'll protect your teeth and gums, you'll help prevent high blood pressure, and you might just live longer, too!<br />And Mercola and Levy tell you in plain English how following their system will help you to lose weight, or at least, avoid unhealthy weight gain, like by preventing your stomach from becoming a bread factory!<br />THE NO-GRAIN DIET IS DYNAMITE!!!<br />                                 Chari Krishnan<BR>                                 RESEARCHKING	2004-04-23

And so Kalb gets together with a bunch of broadcasters, writers, current and former players and makes sure the reader knows all about his knowledge of basketball statistics, and then makes a strong case for something I've been saying for the past 10 years, that SHAQUILLE O'NEAL IS THE GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME!!!  Kalb also corrects something that made the official TOP 50 list ridiculous, he includes Dennis Rodman as THE BEST DEFENSIVE FORWARD OF ALL TIME!!!  But in between he makes a number of weak arguments, like naming Wilt Chamberlain as the 2nd best player ever, and better than Kareem because he scored 50 points in a game more often, which is easily countered by the fact that Wilt played most of his career against 6'9 and shorter centers, while Kareem played against nearly every great player who ever played, except Bill Russell, who had enough sense to get out just before Kareem arrived!  Other questionable rankings include the placement of Larry Bird over Magic Johnson:Magic won more championships, sorry, Elliot, and even Larry Legend himself will tell you that CHAMPIONSHIPS meant more to him than statistics!<br />Another flawed choice is including Bob Cousy, who could only dribble with one hand which wouldn't even get him in NBA games today, and leaving out Lenny Wilkens--a lefthander who nobody could stop!--and who once told me, &quot;Bob Cousy wasn't that good a player.&quot;<br />Also, aside from the placement of Shaq at #1, and the inclusion of Rodman, Kalb's list simply juggles theorder of the official list, and the same oldtimers like George Mikan, Dave Cowens, and Dolph Schayes are still there, and none of these guys could even start today, and I consider myself THE ULTIMATE DAVE COWENS FAN!!!  (But he just wouldn't be tall enough to play center in today's NBA!)<br />But I must salute Elliot Kalb for doing two things:one, he had the intellectual guts to go against popular thinking and name Shaquille #1--and Shaq has both the statistics and the championships to prove it!--and two, he included Dennis Rodman--with great rebounding statistics and 5 NBA championships!!!--who was only left off of the official list because he isn't cleancut enough, which was a disgrace!<br />But I just can't see how NBA TOP 50 guys like George Mikan, Bob Cousy, and Dave Cowens could start in today's NBA, let alone be some of the 50 GREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME.<br />Kalb calls himself Mr. Stats, but the problem with his statistics is that the players since the 1970s are MORE ATHLETIC than the players of the 1960s and earlier, that, period, with only about 2 or 3 exceptions like Chamberlain, Russell, and the Big O.  And I'm not even sure that Rick Barry could start in today's league, because even he once said in a SLAM! interview that he wished he'd had hands like Dr. J's, and I don't see how he could have guarded him<br />MR. STATS NEEDS TO SPEND LESS TIME LOOKING AT BASKETBALL STATISTICS, AND MORE TIME LOOKING AT PLAYERS to MAKE A BETTER TOP 50 PLAYERS LIST!!!  AND MOST OF THEM BETTER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DRIBBLE AND DUNK!!!	2004-01-16

CAPTAIN ACTION IS THE BEST HOBBY BOOK EVER!!!  Captain Action:The Original Super-Hero Action Figure by Michael Eury is a beautiful book about Captain Action, the action figure of the 1960s that could be transformed into a variety of superhero characters through the unique use of available costumes, like Superman, Spiderman, The Green Hornet, Flash Gordon, The Phantom, and the Lone Ranger.  From spectacular front cover to spectacular back cover it's one of the best written, best photographed, and best researched books I've ever seen, and that doesn't just mean for hobby books, but of all the books I've ever read!<br />Michael Eury does it all with this book--he talks about his own experiences as a child when from the time he got his first Captain Action figure--with two left hands!--and then he goes through all sorts of details about the creation of Captain Action in the 1960s, the accessories, the stories behind the characters used for his costumes--like Superman, Batman, Flash Gordon, and all the rest, and the failed line of Super Queens, female action figures designed as a companion line for Captain Action--and well, there's really nothing like this I've ever seen before:a book where the writer covers everything!<br />But Michael Eury keeps right on going, to the Captain Action comic book of the 1960s, and into the future with the resurrection of a smaller Captain Action in the 1990s, to the customized versions of Captain Action suits by fans to create new characters never used by the manufacturers, like Green Lantern and Dr. Doom.<br />If there's a flaw in the book, it's that Eury doesn't do enough analysis about why Captain Action failed, not once, but twice, probably due to poor design the first time--despite all the great costumes and marketing, CAPTAIN ACTION HIMSELF NEVER LOOKED LIKE A SUPERHERO!!!--and probably because he was smaller and weaker looking when he was reproduced in the 1990s!!!<br />But even so, MICHAEL EURY'S CAPTAIN ACTION IS THE BEST HOBBY BOOK EVER!!!<br />Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING	2003-09-08

I still remember Bill Walton's 44 point performance in the NCAA Championship game in 1973, maybe the greatest NCAA final performance ever.  Walton followed his collegiate career at UCLA at the end of the 1974 college basketball season with an injury filled NBA career with just three full seasons, his  championship year with the Portland Trailblazers in 1977 in his first full pro season (he was hurt most of the 1974-75 season and the 195-76 season)--still Portland's only championship--1985 with the LA Clippers (he missed all of the Clippers' 1981-82 and 1982-83 seasons), and an unusual season as Sixth Man of the Year in 1986 as he won a championship with the Boston Celtics.<br />After more injuries Walton retired and started a new career as a basketball announcer for NBC, and I've been impressed:he's good, he's honest, and he's funny!  And he's parlayed the broadcasting into a career as an entertaining writer, too, as his articles are a blend of former New York sportswriter Dick Young and every ultraliberal who ever played a guitar, protested, or smoked marijuana.  So I was expecting a lot from NOTHING BUT NET, but as much as I hate to admit it except for the stories about his 3 seasons with the Boston Celtics--particularly a one on one game with Kevin McHale and his thoughts about Larry Bird--Walton leaves out too much of the obvious, like what happened to his wife, the mother of his 4 sons?  And what about all the controversies involving drugs, the Draft, and Patty Hearst that he got into at UCLA?  And what about the feud between him and John Salley at NBC?<br />  Just like Walton's career, sometimes in NOTHING BUT NET Walton is there, and sometimes he's not.<br />  Chari Krishnan  RESEARCHKING	2002-05-13

The writing is terrific! Don Heck drew IRON MAN till the mid 1960s, and then Gene Colan took over.  Don Heck was good, but Gene Colan and writer Roy Thomas made IRON MAN INTO THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN!!!<br />	2001-07-13

JACK KIRBY IS STILL THE KING OF COMIC BOOKS!!!  Yes, I hate to admit it, but I agree with most of the other reviewers that the writing in this graphic novel reprint of some old FANTASTIC FOUR stories is not Kirby's best work--or even the best Dr. Doom appearances, because those were issues 57-60!!!--but even a Kirby collection at 80% is still better than 90% of other comic books, and so I rate this graphic novel 4 stars.<br />  But Kirby's artwork--inked by INKER SUPREME JOE SINNOTT, THE MOST UNDERRATED MAN IN THE HISTORY OF COMIC BOOKS JUST FOR HIS INKING OF JACK KIRBY'S WORK!!!--in reprinted issues 84 through 87 is...FANTASTIC!!!  And that's not just the way they drew Dr. Doom, but also Mr. Fantastic, The Torch, The Thing, the supporting characters, the scenery, and of course, the women!!!<br />  I've bought a lot of graphic novels over the years--including the first ever printed, THE ORIGINS OF MARVEL HEROES--but I'd probably rank THE VILLAINY OF DR.

Larry Bird's playing career in Boston--especially his 3 consecutive MVP seasons from 1984-1986--were the most exciting Celtics seasons ever since I started following the NBA--and Dave Cowens and the Celtics--in 1973.   I loved the 1984 Championship Finals, the 1985 Finals, and THE 1986 FINALS--WITH BILL WALTON!!!   <br />    But as exciting a player as Larry Bird was, DRIVE:THE STORY OF MY LIFE is boring, and just another life story by an athlete on his way out.   In fact, Bird's career was marred by injuries after the end of the 1987-88 season, and he never played in another NBA Final after 1987.   So after 1988, he was really coasting on his past performances.<br />    The two most interesting parts of DRIVE are Bird's stories about Bill Walton's time with the Celtics, and a brief mention of his heart racing during the 1986 Finals against Houston, the best series I've ever seen.   I wondered why his heart would be racing, and later when Bird's heart trouble was revealed it all added up--athletes conceal their health problems just like the rest of us.<br />    But Larry Bird after 1988 was just a shadow of his former self, unable to dominate, unable to run, and unable to carry the Celtics back to the NBA Finals.   In fact, a book about the Dream Team had a chapter that called him THE GREAT WHITE HASBEEN, and that echoes Dennis Rodman's comment in 1987 that Bird was overrated because he was white.   Before 1987, I've never seen a player--particularly a white player--who had to be guarded as much as Bird--forget about him scoring, coaches like Pat Riley just didn't want him to have the ball! But Bird lost a step in the 1987-88 season--ironically, the year he started serious weight training--and the Detroit Pistons' braintrust saw that!--and that was the beginning of the end for Bird, even though he scored the highest average ever for a Celtic that year, 29.9 points per game.<br />     From 1980 to 1988, Larry Bird was the greatest forward in thehistory of basketball.  But after that, he was just another player.   This book rambles and avoids that, and doesn't deal with some of the questions about the Celtics like what really happened to Coach KC Jones--how many coaches quit after 4 NBA Finals appearances in 5 years?--and why the Celtics didn't know that 1986 #1 draft pick Len Bias was a drug user, before he overdosed on cocaine.<br />      If you want to read a great basketball book by a former Celtic, read Bob Cousy's THE LAST LOUD ROAR, or anything by Tommy Heinsohn.   Their books go into more detail, have better pictures, are surprisingly candid about race and the Celtics-- which is an unavoidable pairing--and are more interesting.   Larry should have passed on this one.<br />                                    Chari Krishnan                                     RESEARCHKING	2001-05-08

I'm not a Harry Truman fan but PLAIN SPEAKING:AN ORAL BIOGRAPHY OF HARRY TRUMAN is sensational!!! President Harry Truman was a bit of a hothead--it wasn't necessary for him to drop atomic bombs on Japan--and Truman never got over the public's love of Dwight Eisenhower, but even so this &quot;oral biography&quot; of Harry Truman is sensational!<br />     I first read PLAIN SPEAKING while in college taking an English class over years ago, and it's still a book I think about often.   Why?  Well, like Theodore Roosevelt before him, Harry Truman was dead square, a President who you didn't have to guess where he stood--he'd let you know!<br />     Merle Miller is pretty interesting himself, and his insight as a midwesterner--&quot;I moved away from Iowa to get away from people like him (Truman)&quot; is funny and fascinating.   Miller does a super job with details like describing Truman's childhood, and even discusses Truman's ideas about morality like &quot;the things that ruin a man.&quot;   And Miller doesn't shy away from asking Harry Truman about The Bomb, and even suggests at the end of one chapter that while Truman may not have done any major second guessing about The Bomb, he &quot;had obviously given the matter a lot of thought.&quot;<br />    So what made Harry Truman special?   CHARACTER!!!  Merle Miller brings that out loud and clear!   Truman wasn't fancy, but he got the job done, and without a lot of confusion about whether he was involved in covert operations overseas, bugging the White House, or soliciting sex from his female employees!   (In fact, Miller suggests that Truman's knowledge of women was limited to his sisters, his wife, and his mother!)<br />    As you read PLAIN SPEAKING, Merle Miller gradually becomes a Harry Truman fan, and so will you!<br />                                  Chari Krishnan                                   RESEARCHKING                                   Tango2200@Hotmail.Com	2001-04-20

Earl Naumann's LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT grabbed my attention immediately at a local bookstore in Savannah, Georgia.  Dr. Naumann's premise--and eyecatching title!--is a major conclusion of my research about Sociobiology that a huge percentage of relationships are based on physical appearance, and in particular the phenomenon known as love at first sight.  But except for Leil Lowndes in a chapter of HOW TO MAKE ANYONE FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU, no author has ever tackled the subject of love at first sight seriously--UNTIL NOW!!!<br />  Dr. Naumann is a bold scientist; he asked a lot of questions before he wrote this book and he asked men, women, whites, blacks, Asians, Latins, and others.  He gives statistics to support love at first sight and even produces statistics to go one step further:Dr. Naumann says couples who fall in love at first sight stay married more than couples who don't!  WOW!<br />  But then comes the biggest flaw in this book:Dr. Naumann stumbles when he tries to explain why people fall in love at first sight! He concludes that the 3 main causes of love at first sight are: 1) Physical Appearance; 2) Personality traits; and 3) Career Achievement/Potential.<br />  And then LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT loses most of its credibility! HEY, WAIT A MINUTE DOC!!!  Are you trying to tell me people fall in love at first sight because of personality or careers as much as for looks???<br />  THAT DOES NOT COMPUTE!!!  Sure, women see men and say, &quot;Oh, boy, he's looks like he'll be a doctor one day! I'm in love!&quot;  And personality as the reason for love at first sight doesn't seem much more likely, either.  &quot;Oh, boy, she looks like he has a great personality, I want to marry her!&quot;  Yes, personality and career acheivement or potential may be important in some forms of gradual love, but that's not what this book is supposed to be about!  So that leaves us with category #1, physical appearance.  Dr. Naumann produces statistics to show women consider athletic ability in men to be important, but he also shows that men don't care about athletic ability in women, but are instead more interested in youth and beauty.  My research supports him on both counts.  But since this book is supposed to be about love at first sight it should have focused more on what specific physical characteristics are involved in love at first sight, or, &quot;What was it you saw when you first saw that person that made you fall in love?&quot;  But instead Dr. Naumann spends a lot of time beating around the bush with TRUE ROMANCE stories from various people who claimed to have experienced love at first sight, and so LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT is like a scientific study of UFOs that turns into into an alien abduction story.<br />  So how does LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT comare with other books about Sociobiology?  Well, Leil Lowndes' HOW TO MAKE ANYONE FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU is more useful, but I didn't buy it till a month after I first saw it; Nancy Etcoff's SURVIVAL OF THE PRETTIEST has more interesting research, but it was a year after I heard about that book that I finally mail ordered it;  but what happened when I first saw Earl Naumann's LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT?

The only thing that's missing from this book is some idea of Steve's personal life in adulthood, and it's an obvious omission compared with the rest of the book that goes into many details about Reeves' childhood.
