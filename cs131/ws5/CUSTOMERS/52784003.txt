A woman talks him through the house, chatting constantly without any interrogation.  Arriving at the corpse, they stand about talking for  another 10 pages about the dead man and her theory that he was stealing  priceless books from the library where he worked.  Although the author  tells us the corpse is swollen and putrifying, our characters must have  nerves and noses of steel.  Later on, McGarr and his crew watch blue videos  starring the late corpse.  The chatty lady watches with them.  (Is this  typical of how Irish police operate?  Hey - let's watch dirty movies with a  witness!)  This brings us up to about page 80.  No other non-police  character has appeared.  Hmmm - wonder whodunnit?  Well, if the novel  doesn't succeed as a mystery or a police procedural, maybe it's full of  Irish character and atmosphere.  Oops - the author forgot to include them  too!  Most of the characters speak the way Americans expect the Irish to  speak - they really aren't allowed to be human, just pleasant caricatures.   The whole novel seems a lazy effort.	2000-02-20

Tourists spend their lives doing a Cook's Tour of their own reality.  Ignoring their slums.  Travellers make the  journey more slowly, in greater detail.  Mix with the natives . . . They've  become terrifyingly real for themselves.  Their lives are no longer a  hobby.&quot;  Laidlaw is forever trying to understand the &quot;why&quot;.   His attempts to do so and almost overwhelming compassion are two of the  best things about this book.  Another is McIlvanney's depiction of the  tough side of Glasgow.  Add to that a compelling prose style, and the novel  is hard to beat. <br />&quot;Laidlaw&quot; won the Silver Dagger Award for  1977 and an earlier, non-detective novel won the Whitbread Book of the Year  Award.

Old lying books would be consulted; in padded club chairs grizzled gentry whose grandfathers had witnessed it would prate  of that milky perversion that once diluted the unmixed absolute of night.   And those who had no vested gossip in the matter would proclaim it unlikely  to recur, or impossible to have happened.&quot;  Morley's novel is full of  similar wonderful passages.  It is also, metaphorically, the story of such  a moonshiny night when Martin, the little boy who wanted to spy on adults  to see if they were happy, appears as a boy in an adult's body.  Things  ensue at a leisurely (perhaps a little too leisurely) pace.  While the  writing at times is quite funny, the novel itself is full of sad whimsy.   The novel asks, &quot;What do we do to ourselves as we grow up?&quot;  Morley's novel, first published in the 1920's, is a wonderful book.	2000-02-13
US	52784003	RFMAIS97ITXIU	0684839199	419002241	Alexander Hamilton, American	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Good Brief Life	Short biographies, led by the &quot;Penguins Lives&quot; series, are making a comeback and Brookhiser's life of Hamilton is a welcome non-Penguin addition.  Short lives seem to fall into one of two categories:   We are presented the life and pretty much left on our own to conclude why  the subject was worth writing about (literary, juvenile and sports  biographies are of this type) or we are presented with only sketches of the  life as the author writes an interpretive essay on the subject.   Brookhiser's book falls into the latter category.  Indeed, three of the ten  chapters are self-contained essays on Hamilton's words, views on rights,  and passions.  The result of this essay approach is often that the subject  never quite leaps off the pages.  Brookhiser seems more interested in  Hamilton as a historical figure - someone who made his way onto the 10  dollar bill - than as a flesh and blood human being who dies in a duel.   Still, once we accept the limitation's of the &quot;brief lives&quot;  approach, there is much to like. Brookhiser has interesting ideas about  Hamilton's status as an outsider and his views on American society and  slavery.  He makes effective points on why we should know about Hamilton.   He seems to have read and digested Hamilton's writings, although as one  previous reviewer noted, he does seem to cite back to the same sources too  often.  He understands about politics in the age of passion.  It's a good,  if not complete, picture of Hamilton.	2000-02-13

This time, she places her characters in a tangled web surrounding the publication of Dennis Orphan's  novel.  His novel is based on the life of his only real friend who is an  ex-wife of a Hemingway-type writer.  Turn, Magic Wheel does not, however,  match Powell's later works such as The Golden Spur or The Wicked Pavilions.   Powell does not yet seem to have completely found her narrative voice and  this leads to some hurky-jerk story telling.

The only story that engaged me was by Grand Master AE Van Vogt - a story written over 50 years ago.  I don't remember much else about that volume.<br />Nebula  Awards 33 concludes with a story by Grand Master Poul Anderson written  about 40 years ago.  It's easily the best thing in the book.  If I were to  guess what this means about contemporary short science fiction, I would say  the genre is not only short on new ideas, but it has lost the joy of the  narrative.  Indeed, little happens in many of these stories.  And, as the  earlier reviewer noted, many really aren't sf.   Jane Yolen's award-winning  story about Emily Dickinson and a spaceship is silly and unnecessary.   Gregory Feeley's story is interesting, but there's no narrative.  John  Howard Gardner's story has perhaps the best science fictional idea.  It  deals with certain snake-like analogues in human blood which have a  religious significance that affected society.  But, it's just some  conversational set-pieces with no narrative.  Nancy Kress's piece starts  good, gets better, and then just ends.  (Is there a novel in the works?)   The one story with spaceships is actually a ghost story.<br />Science fiction  and fantasy writers are perhaps entitled to pat themselves on the back from  time to time - after all few others do.  But editor Connie Willis's gushy  endorsements do nobody any good.  Rather than let the reader judge the  stories, she keeps telling us how good they are.  (No analysis is  provided.)  She makes the absurd claim that this volume is as good as the  first volume, which contained much-anthologized classic works by Aldiss,  Ellison and Zelazny.<br />Willis mourns her inability to include all the  nominees while including nine (!) gushy pages on Poul Anderson and about  one apiece on each story.  The volume concludes with a totally unnecessary  (and, except for a piece by Kim Stanley Robinson, facile) collection of  pieces about 1997.  But who cares about 1997 in the middle of 1999?  It  includes about 10 pages ripped out from the award winning novel.  (Why do  this?  The novel will probably have greater circulation than this  collection.)  Maybe K.D. Wentworth wouldn't have the ignominy of being the  only short-story nominee left out had all this unnecessary material been  tossed.	2000-01-17

I had hoped that anyone writing a novel on Orwell would possess Orwell's virtues of  directness, frankness, and  lucidity while offering up some ideas.  Caute succeeds on all fronts, and  in some matters of technique he is clearly Orwell's superior.  He also has  a sense of humor and his characters - including Orwell himself - are more  nuanced than any Orwell character.<br />The book's story is about Orwell  researching Animal Farm.  He finds the book's narrator - a boy named Alex -  hanging on at the family farm after his Mum and Dad have both abandoned it.   There are pigs and other animals whose names will be familiar to the  reader.  Alex fills us in on his contributions to both Animal Farm and 1984  and his continuing relationship with Orwell.  The last page of Alex's  narrative contains a surprise which is perhaps intended to show that - as  Orwell says in the novel - Orwell is often wrong.<br />Caute himself has  written 8 other novels and 10 non-fiction books, including several on the  left, communism and fellow travellers.	2000-01-16

The book provides statistics, anecdotes, political history, union history, Dust Bowl history, and it discusses the alphabet soup of  Depression programs and the 1929 crash.  Somehow all of this never comes  into focus.  There isn't a clear narrative.  For example, we don't learn  that the farm economy was depressed throughout the 1920's until page 340 or  so--after Watkins had already discussed the causes of the Depression and  after another section that took us up to the end of the thirties.<br />Watkins  could do some fact checking as well.  He says that the 1935 Social Security  Act &quot;did establish an unemployment and disability insurance program  financed by a tax on employers--to be collected by the states, then  distributed as unemployment or disability payments to those who qualified  under state-established standards.&quot;  The SSA did establish the  unemployment insurance program, but a similar disability insurance program  has never been created.  It wasn't for lack of trying.  Senator Wagner, who  introduced the SSA in the Senate in 1935, introduced a bill to establish a  Federal-State disability program in 1939, but he didn't succeed in seeing  it enacted.  (As of today only California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and  Rhode Island have disability insurance programs which pay benefits to  workers who cannot work due to a non-work related disability.)<br />Watkins  also claims that FDR's 1936 electoral victory &quot;was greater than in any  election since that of James Madison in 1820&quot;.  James Monroe won the  1820 election.<br />But Watkins greatest failure is that he does not place  many events in context.  The Great Depression created the world we live in  today - the Federal legislation on banking, securities, unemployment  insurance, welfare, social security are treated with less emphasis than all  the programs that came in and went in the Depression (the WPA,CCC, NRA).  Yes, we should pay witness to those who lived through the Depression, but  we should also pay witness to the world they created.	1999-12-11

All of the dozen or so Amazon reviewers gave it five stars and I would happily write a review adding five more.  I keep it  conspicuously placed  on my bookshelf so I am reminded of the fun of  reading it.  Perlman's Ordeal is another matter.  Although the book is  every bit the intellectual feast that the Chess Garden was, it lacks a  certain spark that would have kept me interested in the story and in its  protagonist, Dr. Perlman.  Whereas Dr. Uyterhoeven in The Chess Garden was  generously open-minded, Dr. Perlman is every bit the man who can't see  beyond his rather educated nose.  His ordeal is getting past that  limitation - something he never completely seems to do.  Hansen seems to  have let his own main character attentuate his vision.  Also, if there was  a flaw in The Chess Garden, it was that its characters were not completely  rounded - but somewhow it didn't really matter.  It does matter in this  book since we see everything through (via a third person narrator),  Perlman's rather narrow, fretful, selfish eyes.  This left me feeling cold.   Still, Hansen's a major writer and I look forward to his next book.	1999-11-25

With Vigilant, he assumes that anything driveling forth from his first person narrator is intrinsically  interesting.  (This is an increasingly common affliction among writers.)   Faye Smallwood assails us with her emotions and reactions so much that the  reader is deprived of any reaction to the events in the novel.  For  example, the near extinction of the Ooloms seems little more than a side  show for Faye.  As a result, Gardner (or Faye) turned disaster into  banalty. All I &quot;heard&quot; was Faye, Faye and more Faye.  Yes, Faye  has her story and we should hear it.  But there's a whole universe out  there.  Gardner should have let us feel it.	1999-11-22

Yet the vision it presents of those who lead a literary life is one of fretful anxiety.  We are told that the contemporary  Clarissa is happy, but we never feel this happiness.  We do, however, feel  everybody's fretfulness and unhappiness.  There are two suicides in the  book (Woolf and a dying contemporary poet); a third will occur in  &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; when Virginia Woolf finishes it; and a fourth (by  a woman who is reading &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; is attempted off-stage.   This is an attentuated view of life:  Those who read &amp; write are full  of despair.  Life is a burden.  This may not be the message the author  intended, but I can't escape the implication that parents should steer our  children out of books and into football. Many of the reviewers seem to find  in the book an affirmation of life because the survivors soldier on.  Given  its high suicide rate, this seems grasping at straws.  To me, the author  does not come to terms with the more basic question of why the suicides  were unable themselves to soldier on.   I suspect this is because he became  too taken up with pastiching Woolf.	1999-11-22

Although I would encourage anybody looking for a good (if not deep) read to pick up &quot;Blind Justice&quot;, the first book in this series, I would advise those same people to avoid this book.  Everything is too pat:   Sir John Fielding is too wise and knowing; Jeremy (his assistant) is too  nobly naive; their comrades too goody-goody; the bad guys are identified by  wearing (no joke) black.  The attempts at poignancy are as phony as a  sit-com.  Samuel Johnson would probably not recognize the sentimentalized  version of him.  There isn't even a mystery to solve.

Although I will recommend this book to my friends as the best &quot;noir&quot; since Kerr's &quot;Philosophical Investigation,&quot; the author that Thomson most reminds me of is - improbably - Tolstoy.  Like  Tolstoy, Thomson is interested in everything about his characters.  Like  Tolstoy, he never loses his narrative grip.  If it means a 100 page  diversion into another character's life to get from A to B, so be it.  Like  Tolstoy, he's thinking about God.  (The invisible man is missing - have you  seen him?)  Other reviewers see the more tightly structured and less  character driven Kafka and Chandler as influences.  They are, but this book  is so much more.  Thomson has given us something challenging and different.   Like &quot;Philosophical Investigation,&quot; the book seems fated to live  only in the noir genre.  While I like that genre, it's placement there is a  pity.	1999-05-04

It's fantasy for people who can't abide the current Tolkien derivitive word flushers.  Still, there's something lacking - a certain heart-feltness.

Was there a female pope and, if so, how could she have deceived all the people at least some of the time?   If she is a legend, why did the legend start and why did it persist  for so long?  Stanford's not the man for this.  He's another self-absorbed  20th century reporter type who keeps inserting himself into the story and  talking down to the reader. Sometimes I thought I was reading his resume's  account of his journalistic &amp; research abilities.  One of these  abilities is not reflection, which is notably absent in this book.  What is  present is a wishful pushing of his arguments, which hurts his case more  than helps it.  As the Kirkus reviewer notes, he turns suppositions into  facts.  Disappointing book.	1999-04-11

Of all I've read in the past, only one story -  &quot;The Ugly Chickens&quot; - has the feel of a classic.

Neither is it explained why our  girl genius never seemed to have any affection for anybody, yet later  somehow manages to fall in love.  This book is typical of a certain  sub-genre of sf which offers the illusion of character while missing the  essential truth of the heart.  Its first person narrator also provides  detailed recollections of what happened to her when she was five - down to  the things she didn't comprehend.

Like all atrocity stories, the events in Nanking are so horrific that they speak for themselves.  Unfortunately for the reader, Iris Chang doesn't believe this.  She keeps telling us that the actions of the Japanese were  barbaric! etc.  Starting with the introduction, she inserts herself into  the book in a self-congratulatory manner that trivializes the tragedy she  is writing about.  And then there is the bizarre structural problem -  history told Rashomon style.  Doesn't work here.<br />These comments may be  viewed as unduly harsh since Chang has indeed done a service in  resurrecting this story.

And who better than a monster dog who shouldn't exist in the  first place to advise us? &quot;Hope is motion.&quot; writes the Dog's  historian, &quot;Curiosity, desire, and hope alone can keep the surface  from being drawn back to reveal the terrifying mechanism of the  world.&quot;  In the end, the dogs' disease draws back the surface and we  see a distressing doggerdammerung.

However, in Andorra the style and technique match the author's purpose.  The Andorra of the  title is not the real country, but a world we would escape to.  (The unreal  geography is the first clue.)  Yet this world of escape is like the one we  live in.  It reflects ourselves.  We cannot always succeed in being good or  kind or in finding truth; the police will make us paranoid (especially if  we have something to be paranoid about); love and friends are hard to find  and keep; escape is a wish or perhaps only escapism.  Cameron expertly  pulls all this together.<br />The book is not quibble-less. The restrained  depiction of characters often results in a certain coldness.  The  conversation is sometimes too unreal for even this unreal Andorra. Still,  these were minor faults in an otherwise profound book.	1998-11-26

His literary fate is like that of Steinbeck's shorter works - read by 8th graders.  When I mention Richter to my friends they think more of the Newberry than the Pulitzer Prize.  Historical novelists are rarely thought of as having written &quot;literature&quot;, yet that is what Richter wrote.  Like Steinbeck, his style was simple and clear and strong.  Like Steinbeck he understood the pain of being human.  After reading one of his brief novels - they are often only about 200 pages - I wonder why other writers need so many more words.  Richter did not think of himself as an historical novelist.  He wrote instead to give a sense of how people experienced time past.  Things happen in his novels, but the events are secondary to the perceptions, attitudes and (dare I say?) psychology.  &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; is a wonderful example of his work.  Though it is about a teenage boy, it is not the &quot;coming of age&quot; or &quot;rite or passage&quot; story that it is often described as.  It is about a person who lives in a world that has gone beyond his control - his life has been wrested from him by national and racial politics.  His choices turn him into an American isolato.  Very contemporary.  The out-of-print and equally good companion novel &quot;A Country of Strangers&quot; pursues the same themes.  Only in &quot;Country&quot; the protaganist is a white who has lived with the Indians and been returned to the whites.  Like &quot;Light&quot; one of its virtues is to see through other's eyes.  I wish I had the space to quote Stone Girl's dissection of Christianity.  Maybe someday Richter will get his volume in the Libray of American and all his works will come back in print, including my favorite, &quot;The Free Man&quot;.	1998-03-10

Its prose style is disposable, without a glimmer of wit to it.  Its characters have little depth and many are caricatures who make the Power Rangers look profound.  It has too many words, all strung together in uninteresting ways.  It could be half its size.  In these regards, it resembles much pulp science fiction.  Unlike the pulps, it has no drama to redeem itself.  Its idea - man's relation to a God who Lets Bad Things Happen to Good People - isn't new and is lost in all the novel's other problems.  I suspect the book's main appeal arises from the all too trite plot of individual vs. institution.  Given the author's obvious affection for the priest, the &quot;Priest as Deplorable Whore&quot; motif is unbelievable from the start.  &quot;Priests in Space&quot; is not particularly original.  Read Clarke's &quot;The Star&quot; or Blish's &quot;Case of Conscience&quot; or Simmon's &quot;Hyperion.&quot;  The only thing rating a &quot;10&quot; is the book's pomposity and arrogance as exemplified by the &quot;Reader's Guide&quot; at the end.  I am in despair that fiction this poor is praised for the very qualities it lacks:  originality, style and humanity.  Trying isn't enough.	1998-01-13

A good, readable introduction to how people were living and doing before and after the war.  It scores highest in those areas not much covered by most popular histories - reconstruction; poor whites in the South; and a rebellion in Maine(of all places).	1998-01-13
