Written by Zelensky, an Orthodox Christian and Gilbert, a Protestant, this book seeks to teach non-Orthodox Christians about the importance of icon traditions.  They explain what an icon is and is not, dispelling myths held by many Protestants.  The book does more than just to educate about the difference, but provide information on how Protestants can appreciate icons as well.<br /><br />Many Catholics will find the material familiar, but Zelensky does bring a more Eastern approach that many Catholics may appreciate: nice, inexpensive and rewarding book.	2005-09-15

Sowell interestingly traces Black Redneck culture from language, religion, and education from the antebellum South to contemporary America.  His chapter on slavery is sad, but honest and factual.  One comes away seeing the shame of this practice, but one is reminded that it was Western thought, and often, force, that ended this shame on humanity (while slavery still exists, it is no longer a permissible institution throughout most of the world).  He notes the complications of early America and founding fathers distaste for the institution, but also the realities of trying to end the practice while keeping a loosely coalition of independent states.<br /><br />His chapter on Black Education is a must read for all, particularly the liberal elite, if they are open to honest dialogue and real open-mindedness.  It is a blight on the country's educators, lobbyists/teachers unions, and so-called progressives that black Americans are not to excel (many white schools also suffer from these new teaching polices).<br /><br />Thomas Sowell's book is engaging, smart, and needed.	2005-09-09

She discusses the painting (or writing) of icons, and one comes away with great respect for the spiritual engagement an iconographer must encounter to produce such a mystical piece of wok for the faithful.<br /><br />She perfectly reminds the faithful, and educates the non-orthodox that an \\"icon is never complete in itself.  It can never stand alone as an autonomous work of art, but refers to the spiritual dimensions.\\" (p. 12) A brief history is provided.  It is accurate, but not academic, which serves this books ministry well.<br /><br />The book also presents some wonderful icons and their motifs.  She shows mostly Greek and Russian icons, but also discuses theological ideas in relation to icons and Church teachings.<br /><br />This is just a wonderful book which all Christians can benefit and every Orthodox believer should have at hand.	2005-09-09

I think Woods does whitewash some items, like simony, the crusades which helped increase the tensions between the East and West Churches, and the inquisition; but I think he means his book to be a corrective to anti-Catholic propaganda more than a thorough history of the Roman Catholic Church.<br /><br />The book is strongest when dealing with the history of the richness of Catholic pioneers in the sciences.  It is just factual, that the Catholic Church, through its emphasis on education and looking at God's laws as ordered and natural, lead Western thought in the physical sciences during the late scholastic and early enlightenment periods.  Again, the Islamic religion completely lagged in the most important areas to scientific contribution in regards to physics and astronomy.  Woods sets the Galileo record straight as well.<br /><br />The section on international law is also very good and the idea of natural rights.  I do think, however, some credit is due to the Reformation, which advanced political thought and literacy rates and education.  These ideas of conscience also advanced Western Civilization to a great extent.<br /><br />One of the most important contributions is the university system and this expanding of re-thinking of what a university is by the Catholic Church lead to advancements in vocational and academic advancements.	2005-09-09

The book, in a funny way, probably trying to attack the late teens and early 20 crowds, discuss the different end time's scenarios, paying particular attention to modern views proposed by pop-bible writers like Hal Lindsey and Time LaHaye.<br /><br />This book is a great tool to teach youth about the many different end time views among Protestants (very little mention of Catholic and Orthodox views, except in mentioning Church history).  This is not a deep book, but is a primer on the subject.  It is also not an unbiased book, as he does pick fun at certain positions more than others; although, he never really informs the readers of his views.<br /><br />A quick read, with some funny quips.  His suggested books list is a little thin.  There are many more books that should have been added, but none deleted from this list.  All in all, a little shallow, but still fun.	2005-08-10

This book has taken some unfair criticism such as \\"there is nothing new\\" or he monoliths Christians; while these observations are true, they miss the point.<br /><br />This is a popular polemic demonstrating statistically and anecdotally the rapid decline in mainline Christian denominations such as the Episcopalian, United Church of Christ, and Presbyterian USA.  He interviews some mainline pastors and attends a couple of services, letting the reader observe the services through his lens.  He admits that speaking about such a topic will leave many unsatisfied because of the enormous spectrum of Christian belief and issues; but nonetheless, he does a fairly good job in presenting a general view of the liberal problem.  Why attend Church if one can get teh same thing in the secular world: A benign God (if one at all) release of every inhibition.<br /><br />Then he shows the \\"three\\" branches of Christianity that are still conservative:  Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox and Southern Baptist/Evangelical Protestant Christianity.  He shows that contrary to liberal notions, people in these groups do not want a theocracy and are actually very intelligent people who want an intelligent and demanding faith to practice.  I was extremely happy to see Orthodoxy represented since often it is left out of American culture wars.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the book is its size.  It is too small.  This he does anticipate as a problem, but neverless, it is a weakness (publishers, we can take larger material).  Yes, these stats are not new.  I did like that he does not give conservative Episcopalians a pass for leaving the denomination over the homosexual issue, because he is right to notice the problem didn't start there, but with people like Bishop Pike and the denomination denying essential doctrines like the resurrection of Christ over 40 years ago.<br /><br />An easy read, and while he at times broad brushes and his insight is nothing new - it is still effective.problem didn't start there, but with people like Bishop Pike and the denomination denying essential doctrines like the resurrection of Christ over 40 years ago.

Instead, he relies on cheap, childlike (although, most of his story is anything but for children)crack shots at politicians, political pundits, and other modern icons.<br /><br />First, as one can read from a previous review, I have loved most of Miller's work. He is normally insightful with a keen ability to discuss contemporay issues in comic format. Further, he has in the past, made moral statements about society and government in a way that, regardless if one agrees, makes one think and ponder a better world.<br /><br />In this sequel to probably one of the greatest comic stories ever, \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" Miller has trouble connecting the many different story lines and as a result, he goes off on red herrings such as \\"superherochicks\\" and pot shots at obivious renditions of John Ashcroft, Donald Rumsfield, George Will, and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />The inital or main story, that Batman comes out of his hiding place after three years of self-imposed exile, to fight the system ran by villians like Brainiac and Lex Luthor, is all but distracted by the multiple subplots and pot shots. The possibly potential stories of use are brilliant, but there is not enough focus to warrent real interest. Also, the finale between Batman and Robin (Dick Grayson) lacks any real power and I personally came away disapointed that this route of despair (Robin) was taken. The Superman rival Batman plot line is old and though somewhat developed, one wonders if Miller could not have put more creative work and taken another route with these two loved characters.<br /><br />I think this may be one reason why the three books, though highly anticpated and recieved large amounts of pubilicty before release, has received little attention during the release. It just is not that good. The art work is at times interesting, but is often distracted. There are some good one liners, but that does not make a story.

Her approach is mostly a chronological one, starting with Muhammad then moves well into the twentieth century.  The particular version I have also has a short epilogue about Sept 11.  While I think this book is mostly a propaganda piece to make Islam more palpable to Americans, Armstrong to often broad-brushes many dicey subjects regarding Islam's past and \\"spins\\" history like a political aid; however, considering that since Sept 11 there has been an overly polemic accounts of Islam as well, I think this counter-balance may be worth while - assuming people will read an assorted amount of material on this subject.<br /><br />Armstrong is correct in most of the chronology of her text.  She faithfully tells dates and in some instances portrays many in the Islamic faith as faithful, spiritually driven people.  She also, in her epilogue, faithfully reminds Westerners that the men of Sept 11, were not, by the Quran's standards, good Muslims.  Proper Muslims do not go to bars and drink alcoholic beverages.<br /><br />She fails in other areas drastically.  This is a problem for me because Armstrong is a noted scholar and surely knows that she is quite often using loaded language when speaking against another faith or empire, but softer language when speaking about Muslim atrocities.  Examples abound like on page 15 where she downplays Muhammad's polygamy.  She later says that Muslim's militaristic expansion was not \\"impelled by the power of `Islam' (and that it was done for) pragmatic\\" reasons.  This is not entirely true.  After all, Muhammad, it can be easily argued, sought to spread Islam by the sword when it was not accepted peaceably and his actions became a model for others.  He was a strong warrior and a fierce assassin, something she largely avoids discussing.<br /><br />She is also, I assert incorrect in discussing early Islamic rule.  If this is the only book on Islam one read, they would think Muslims treated all their non-Muslim citizens equally.  This is not true.  While most Islamic states were not as egregious as opponents might state, they did make Christians and Jews second class citizens.<br /><br />Lastly, she partially misdiagnoses Islamic fundamentalisms in the last century.  I posit that the raise of Islamo-Fundamentalism is not so much from the 70's and 80's as a response to modernity, which there is some of that involved here, but more in response to the loss of the Ottoman Empire by the West after WW I.  The Ottoman Empire aligned itself with the wrong Western country, and paid heavily for it.  Modernity is only a part of the root of the problem, her analysis is too simple.<br /><br />A readable book, though too PC to be reliable.

He writes about the different Popes, councils, and the relationship between the Western and Eastern states.  He does not deny a papal primacy, but shows what that primacy meant in the early church.<br /><br />He then proceeds to inform the reader of the Gregorian era and its devastating effects on Christian untiy.  The reformation is also mentioned and so is the first and second Vatican Councils.  He shows that since the second council, there are encouraging signs toward reconciliation and that the papacy does play a role in this process.<br /><br />He ends with advice both to the Catholic Church and to the Orthodox Church.

Further, because I have so many books, I read this one since it was borrowed and I had to return it (I wouldn't have purchased this book).  I have only written a couple of reviews on biographical books and typically find auto-bio texts to be faulty since people remember what they want to, or what they have created - this leads to my problem with this book.<br /><br />While I think Martha Beck is a skilled writer, and while I do believe the Mormon denomination to be a perverted alternate to other forms of Christian religions, I found her language often loaded, and often for no apparent reasons.  This I think hurt her credibility with me - while the \\"zingers\\" keep the pace up, they were too often to be taken' seriously. While she tends to make a claim for \\"spirituality\\", I found her journey out of the Latter Day Saints to be problematic.  The claim of a kind of post-traumatic syndrome due to molestation from her father that she appears to have repressed - unlike another reviewer- did not ring true to me.  I'm skeptical of this memory condition anyway, and she provided no reason while one should take her word over her fathers except he is Mormon and with the addition to his peculiar beliefs in a religion with polygamous teachings, he must have molested her (I'm making this an oversimplification, but we only have so much space).<br /><br />She does give a brief non-academic history of Mormonism and here, because a lot of it is true, is very effective.  Her mention of her family (husband John and children, especially a son with down syndrome) is also somewhat touching and hence, her books is somewhat salvageable. Ultimately, I don't know if she is telling the truth about her past, and while she is an engaging writer, I left feeling like she had an ax to grind.  This does not discount the reality of the past, but it is harder for me to accept her version.  I think if someone is interested in Mormonism, one is better reading books, both pro-and con and reaching your own decisions.<br /><br />I did not dislike or liked it, just a quick read, but three stars means you should borrow it before you buy it if the subject interest you.

While dressed as a Christian cleric, Deacon Blackfire is anything but - instead, he is a one eyed king leading the down trodden and drugged ones (under, for lack of a better word - his \\"charm\\") to wreak havoc on Gotham.  Well, my review is a bit simplistic, but the focus is not so much a statement about cults, even though this is an underlying theme, but about Batman's 1. Ordeal, 2. Capture, 3. Escape, 4. Combat (revenge/justice).<br /><br />This is a great story, and the faults are minimal.  The coloring fits this story and Batman's anguished face is ever present as he fights the mind control that he is under.  Robin has a strong and thoughtful role for once.

Batman has retired from crime fighting, but in a city that has developed into hell, Bruce finds he can no longer keep the beast inside, and after a 10 year hiatus, Batman Returns.<br /><br />The stories, plots, and subplots are many.  His enemies range from Two-Face, the Mutant Gang leader, The Joker, and lastly Superman.  The inference is that somehow, the world's superheroes have retired because it is a new society, except for Superman, who is largely a puppet of the President.<br /><br />Special themes involve both Batman's inability to control the beast within him, and no matter how much plastic surgery, Harvey Dent can not control Two-face.  It is the opening book in this miniseries and one could argue the best single story intertwined with the whole.<br /><br />The fights between Batman and the Mutant leader are outstanding - both times.  It is in this second book that Gordon really shines.  Miller has given his part a lot and his friendship with Batman is understood.<br /><br />The next two chapters get wilder as chaos is quickly ensuing and the world seems to be falling apart.  The eighties theme of nuclear war is present, yet while dated, the story still works because every generation seem to have fear mongrels.<br /><br />The expository musings about liberal/conservative views on masked crime fighting is interesting and maybe somewhat prophetic about how people viewed vigilante justice then and now (not too mention, civil justice as well).<br /><br />This series started the graphic novel craze and is one of Miller's best.  The artwork by Klaus Janson and Lynn Varley starts out strong and in line with the story, deteriorates like the story's fictional world.  This makes for compelling images that support a strong story.	2005-07-20

Miller retells the origins story with steady narrative and character development that brings to life old friends, some of whom go back to 1939.<br /><br />Miller gives Gordon a major part and as Batman is begging, Gordon is arriving and the developing relationship is thoughtful and plausible.  The Catwoman is introduced, but subtly so, giving the reader who knows the future a hint of her origins as well.  The tag for the Joker is great (similarly borrowed for the new Batman movie as well as year one's book 3 where Batman is being hunted by SWAT and calls his bats to help out).<br /><br />Frank Miller helped bring comic story telling to the modern era and us comic fans are eternally grateful.

Sometimes he is very insightful and sometimes he is extremely naive, but his eagerness to try and challenge Christian Americans to a more thoughtful is worth a read, even in the instances where he misses the mark.<br /><br />Tony opens the book by seeking to understand why mainline Christians are fleeing mainline denominations for evangelical churches.  His analyses is often on target, but his approach is more sociological than theological (conversion vs socialization, p. 7).  He then asses the growth of evangelical denominations in light of mainline decline.  There is much here that Tony is right on here, but  it is a little to simplistic.  What is nice is that Tony is fair minded and does not write as if he has an ax to grind.<br /><br />Tony addresses some of the major contemporary issues of the day such as homosexuality, sexism, science, the poor, Islam and war.  The strength in these sections is his chapter on homosexuality.  Tony approaches this topic with a genuine heart for homosexuals to enter the Christian faith and he often takes the extreme Christian right to task for making a pariah out of the homosexual. His chapter on Islam is overly naive and simplistic and it appeared he cherry picks history to put a more favorable light on Islam.  I think his heart is in the right place and since there are so many books that cherry pick the evidence the other way, I didn't really mind.<br /><br />His chapter on sexism, however, is just plane misguided.  While I agree with him in a Protestant context that methodology of not allowing women to be pastors may be wrong, he confuses roles and equality and his quick jab at the Catholic Church demonstrates his ignorance of the Catholic position (the Protestant methodology cannot fit the Catholic or Orthodox notions).  After all, the second most important person in the religion is Mary.  Men and women just have different ministries and roles.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good book that will make some mad and some happy, but most people should read this in a manner to examine themselves.

This book is often redundant, as Wallis rehashes the same themes over and over again, and it is not as balanced as the title suggests.  There is a lot of rancor towards conservatives and the Bush administration in particular and often just mild lip-service on why the \\"left doesn't get it.\\"<br /><br />I wanted to like this book more.  As a Christian, I do not belong to any political party. Both parties have strong suits and weak areas. I have criticisms on both major parties, but Wallis is so caught up in his political position, that scripture is used as a pre-text to spank the Bush administration and is seldom used to spank the Democratic party.<br /><br />Wallis is pushing the turn of the century social gospel and devotes a major portion on the poor and scriptural text that support helping the poor. Wallis, however, needs to realize that the poor in our country do not suffer from poverty as much as moral fortitude (he gives slight mention to this, but does not developing it).  If one wants poor, go to Central America, Africa, and some parts of Southeast Asia.  Our poor are quite rich, flooded with opportunities (I know - I was once poor and now make a nice middle class income). Yes, Christian must help the poor, but giving money in the name of government programs without any moral change is self defeating (it has been tried and failed already Jim).  Is the US system perfect, no - but governmental programs tend to burden the progress of helping the needy, not enhancing it.<br /><br />His most thoughtful idea about the poor is that conservatives and liberals often make a \\"false choice\\" on how to solve the problem when he speaks about marriages on page 235.  Here he speaks also to the faith community and challenges \\"Churches and nonprofit organizations\\" to be solution to poverty.<br /><br />Wallis' review of our current \\"wars\\" and foreign policy positions is simply lacking in any real depth.  There are more thoughtful left positions by other theologians.  Wallis sounds more like hippie who has confused the reality of this conflict with leftist polemics.

While a little eccentric, Urban was true to the bushido roots, while adapting karate for an American population.<br /><br />This book covers karate philosophy in its mid-twentieth century form and promotes the positive aspects of discipline and etiquette.  The book deals with attitude and motivation of spirit.  The second half of the book has \\"dojo stories\\" that help embody the essences of karate training.<br /><br />This is just a nice and simple book worth the read.	2005-06-12

I am still so surprised to run into martial artist, of all ranks, who do not crosstrain their bodies by adding heavey bag workouts and weight training.<br /><br />While I do have some minor disagreements, all in all, this book is worth five stars for those who have traveled down the road to increase one's martial skills outside the dojo.  Often I find martial artists, at the gym I attend, lazyly working on a heavy bag and in no way increasing their power, speed or stamina.  This book may enlighten some of these more lazy or ignorant karateka and provide them some extra tools to train harder and smarter (I do not use the word ignorant here as a pagorative - we all have learning to do).<br /><br />The chapter on weight trainingg is still needed. Yes, progress has been made in the last 25 years (I grew up in the era that weights slowed you down mindset), but we still need to spread the word that weight training is beneficial for martial arts.  I have ran into many people, although less than during my initial training, who do not value any kind of resistance training.  Many of them are surperb athiletes - how much more they could excell with this author's advice.<br /><br />Other chapters are good as well and after one reads this book, I hope they will continue to train and read other texts to increase their martial skills and add to the material presented here.	2005-05-18

Books	4	11	23	N	N	Like Most Libertarians, John Gets It Half Right	5 stars for enjoyment and 3 stars for content: Like many libertine followers, John gets it half right, but his book is extremely enjoyable and he makes accessible, Ayn Rand objectiveness theory at a popular level (this book is influenced by the popular 20th century political philosopher Ayn Rand).<br /><br />First, where does John get it right? Well, he does \\"hit the nail on the head\\" very often. He destroys the sacred cow of leftists that capitalism is \\"evil.\\" While he fails to cite all his research with a bibliography or even more precise information so people can verify his data, much of what he cites is easy to find at several government or think take studies. Much of it is also self evident information based on reason and logic.<br /><br />For example his argument that America's poor are relatively rich compared to most in this world is accurate and that those countries that restrict free markets with stuffy government programs increase the poverty level is a matter of history (US vs Soviet Union as an example).<br /><br />While he picks on government programs that reward a welfare state for the poor, he is balanced enough to mention the endless government programs that help the rich. He is further correct in calling the government out in making the poor a pariah while increasing subsidies for corporations and farmers.<br /><br />Further, he is correct on the billions spent on the failed drug war and the failed fight against prostitution. His sections on junk science are great.<br /><br />Next where does he go wrong? Well, his section on physician assisted suicide is extremely week and as he says in other areas, \\"lazy thinking.\\" He does not cite the problems these laws have had inn countries where it is legal, nor of the possible abuses. Lastly, he does not address the cowardly laws that have surfaced in other countries or Oregon. After all, if one wants to kill themselves, why get a doctor and displace one's guilt. There are several cheaper ways of doing business (bullet to the heart is very effective).<br /><br />As a journalist, he like others in the profession, under developed their arguments (a rampant problem in that profession) and makes non-sensical assertions. Take for example, his \\"Who did more for the world: Michael Milken or Mother Teresa?\\" Well, there are some serious flaws in his presentation. One, he must assume that materialism is the best thing in the world, since his argument is based on economics. This is highly debatable. Further, unintended consequences may not be able to be measured or did he even try to measure them. Also, Mother Teresa's example and life may inspire others for many for centuries to come, ever increasing her influence. There are several other problems with this section alone, but that would be a long essay in and of itself. A better way to ask his question would be a less contentious postulation, \\"Who has increased the wealth of people more?\\"<br /><br />All in all, a very fun read and while I sometimes disagreed with him, I enjoyed his presentation and willingness to state his positions knowing many, if not all people will disagree with him on some issue. Also, John pokes fun at himself a lot, and you cannot help but like a man who is so brutally honest.fective).

It demonstrates the essential difference between Christianity and Islam; one (Christianity) is a religion founded on love and freedom from bondage, while the other (Islam) seeks to enslave and make others \\"submit.\\"  He opens the book by noticing the fundamental differences between Jesus and Muhammad and their views on such things as marriage, God, heaven.<br /><br />Chapter two is a perfect, yet quick history lesson that is most relevant for secular people and Christians who insisted on thinking Islam, in its normative state, is a religion of peace.  He accurately shows the differences in the growth of the two religions.  Initially (first 300 years) Christianity spread through a passive movement relying on a sociological construct based on loving their neighbor and martyrdom.  Islam spread immediately by the sword - this is objective historical data, no polemics here.<br /><br />The other chapters are good, and while I cannot whole heartily endorse all his assertions, when he deals with history he is accurate and when he asserts a particular theological concept or idea, the reader knows the difference.  The material and arguments are well laid out and overall, this is an outstanding work that any laymen can read and get an accurate historical understanding of the Islamic religion as it compares to Christianity.<br /><br />I do need to note, there are muslims who seek a spiritual interpretation of the koran and Islamic history; they do so with either great courage or a congnitive dissonance.  But if the West insists on accepting a politically correct Islam, then I hope these Islamic mystics succeed; because the West doesn't heed, it may very well fail.	2005-03-01

Batman learns that he is to protect the Holy Grail (the bloodline obligation story is weak as another reviewer noted) and does his best to do so.  The grail heals him when he takes a step in faith after being wounded, and he proposes to Batgirl/Oracle that the grail can restore her as well - she lacks faith and turns down the opprotunity.  This should have been fleshed out more and could have been a compelling story - why some take the step toward faith, and others do not.<br /><br />The artwork is good, but not oustanding or compelling.  The story too short, but the ending is outstanding and allows the reader to see Batman for who he is - a man who will never give up, but also one who will submit his ego for the good of all, for he knows his strengths and his limitations.	2005-01-10

Grant Morrison (writer) and Dave McKean (artist) produced a well written story with a interesting concept:  Batman must go in Arkam to free the innocent because the imantes are now running the asylum.  Of course, the supervillians, led by the Joker, are inmates of Arkum because well, most of the are crazy.<br /><br />The book weaves two stories into one, that of Amadeus Arkham and his need to found an Asylum to help people and Batman's need to save people.  Amadeus builds the Asylum, Batman enters it. Batman enters the Asylum and in daling with his arch-villians he must also deal with himself.  He wants to pray to God, but \\"has no God.\\"  He becomes wounded and battered, but in the end, he finds in a sense faith in others.  A women who saves him while fighting and Harvey Dent makng the morally right choice, countering the flip of his coin.  Knowing the end doesn't hurt this story, because the story is filled in the in-betweens - the journey. Where Batman, though not complete, finds his way in this madhouse, Arkham it seemed, losed it.<br /><br />McKean's art work is staggering, compelling, surreal, and spectaular.  One is absobed into the pages and the images imprinted into your eyes, then mind, bringing a sense that you are not reading a comic, but dreaming a nightmare.  Simply the best.  I picked up this book in 1990 and every few years, and every time I re-read it, I am once again compelled to dream this nightmare.	2005-01-10

Yes, it has a Miller feel, but this helps the consistency of the Batman mythos (something Miller himself forgot to due in Dark Knight Strikes Again).<br /><br />I do agree with the critique of too many Batman rogues gallery villains making cameo appearances.  The Penguin and Croc parts could have been served better with fresh new characters; but the Joker at the end is a good use of a cameo from Batman's super villains.  But Batman's struggle for right vs wrong, existential quest in his belief in God (he doesn't seem to believe but his actions follow a religious ethic and uses religious language to describe God's attributes, There is no pity in God.\\"  This is good writing and often mirrors real people with real questions, no matter there \\"super\\" status.<br /><br />I did not find this story slow, but interesting.  The sub-plot involving the boy and the death of his parents is also very well done.  While not at the epic portions of \\"Hush\\" or \\"The Long Halloween\\", this is still a worthy read for Batman fans.  Far superior to Absolution, Harvest Breed, and Death and Glory.	2005-01-05

Michael Brewer, a pastor, professor and lover of comics, has written an entertaining and insightful read that explores the common links between comic book characters (mostly heroes), humankind, and the Christian message.  Lest anyone think this is an overly preachy book, it draws on expierences of people as well as Christianity.  Although many of the themes may be accidental, Brewer notices that this cannot be help because, \\"Our Maker built us with a persistent longing for a rescuer who will save us from injustice and suffereing.\\" (p. 10)<br /><br />All the primary chapters dealing with popular superheroes are just great.  Superman, Batman, Captian America, Spiderman, and Wonder Woman are particularly interesting, but the chapter on the Fantasic Four is probably the best (I say this as a Batman and Daredevil fan); however, this is my complaint with the book and why it falls a star short of five.  Daredevil is one of the most inetersting and dynamic characters when Frank Miller developed and explored Daredevil/Matt Murdock's Catholicism.  there are so many good themes here, but Brewer focus on the least complex (Daredevil's ability to recognize the truth).<br /><br />Some may say I'm being picky, but I think Brewer would appreciate my position - after all, the comic book world, while mundane and childish to many, is serious stuff.	2005-01-01

Lewis' Case for the Christian Faith	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Promising, but Somewhat  Underdeveloped	I have mixed feelings about this book:  In one aspect, I enjoyed it greatly, but in other areas, I thought it was flat and niether appealed to academics, C.S. Lewis fans, or laymen.  Ultimately, there are some great things and great writing, mixed with at times a flat presentation and underdeveloped presentation.<br /><br />First, the book starts out very promising.  The first two chapters are well presented, but the first chapter \\"Some Reasons fo Lewis' Success\\" is an example of the problem I had with this boo.  It is written well, some nice insights, but is too shortand feels incomplete (to someone who has read many other works by Lewis and on Lewis, it is too short, whetehr someone reading this book as a first on Lewis would feel the same, I do not know).<br /><br />Purtill dos do a fine job in showing the different writings of Lewis, both his fiction, non-fiction, and letters, and how they support his ideas in Christian theology.  He does a great job in showing Lewis' thought on \\"mind and expierences\\" in accounting for how ideas, never expierenced, can be truthful.  He does explain well Lewis' exposition on the Trinity(but Lewis' explaination fo the Trinity stands on its own; however, because of the chapters purpose, it was needed in this chapter).<br /><br />On the chapter, \\"Who is Christ\\", Purtill's chapter is too small and does not do justice on Lewis' thoughts and ideas.While \\"Miracles and History\\" is a nice chapter, \\"death and Beyond\\" is hardly noticable both in length and impact.<br /><br />All in all, the price is right so one cannot go wrong adding thsi to the C.S. Lewis section of teh home library, but the work is hardly exicting, nor completely boring.  Just an average read.	2004-12-24

This book by Richard Abanes is formatted greatly for the average Christian, and his similar Q&A allows the reader to read what the Brown asserts in his book and what the hsitroical or theological accurate answer truly is.<br /><br />Abanes has written some nice books, particularly on the end- times and Mormons, but has touch on other subjects with maybe too much suspicion (his book on Harry Potter).  This book is short and sweet and provides enough information for the audience to refute Brown's book, but avoids details the reader is probably not very interested in.  Of course, conspiracy theorists who what to believe Brown's book is accurate will not be swayed, but then again, neither are conspiracy theorists in other camps - they must have their conspiracy regardless of the evidence.<br /><br />Abanes covers the most important topics, ranging from Da Vinci himself, his paintings, the gnostic gospels, the the priory of sion, etc, etc, etc.  This is a good little book that takes very little time to read.	2004-11-28

Well, mostly because there are many suckers who actually by in to the fictional, asserted as fact, assertions in this fictional work by Dan Brown.<br /><br />My purpose for reading this book was to recommend the various books written about Brown's novel.  This book is solid and the information very accurate, so I can highly recommend it; however, some newer Christians or people who are not used to reserach beyond the noramlly light reading and pamplets often produced in Christian circles, this book may lose its audience.<br /><br />Olson and Miesel do an outstanding job in discussing the history of gnosticism, correcting Brown's ridculious assertions about Constantine, the Vactican, and the influence paganism had on Christianity.<br /><br />Their review of Da Vanci' art work used in the book is accurate, but a little to dry and seemed hurried.  Also, while they often attack the ABC special on Brown's book, they do not mention that even the show was an infommercial for Brown's book, they did admit that the overwhelming majority of scholars admit that Brown's assertions are way off the mark.	2004-11-07

First, the title is quite far reaching.  While it can be easily argued, and he does, that there is an assault on Christian teachings and people in public schools, including colleges, media, an the work place; one is still lost to say \\"persecuted\\" except maybe in the broadest sense of the word.  There is a persecuted Christian community where people are imprisoned and often killed.  The secular attack on Christians in this country is, I assert, to marginalize it so much by taking it out of the public arena that they hope it fades away.<br /><br />First, the problems with the book:  Often, more than I would want, he tends to align conservative political positions with Christians.  But, he does seem to notice this pitfall, and once he does it, tries to get back on track.<br /><br />The book has a lot of good arguments, mostly anecdotal however.  Sure, much of these stories are confirmed, but, one could also tell many anecdotes where places are very friendly towards the Christian community (namely because these places have such an active and strong Christian population).<br /><br />His chapter on the academy and academic freedom shows where the roots of intolerance takes fold towards Christians, where many students and academics marginalize Christian teachings and students.  His stories involving the work place and government go awry programs are also good;  His analyses of this countries founding, how public schools came t being, and on the \\"establishment clause\\" are accurate and worth the read.<br /><br />Still, there are other books that deal with the culture war that I assert are much better such as \\"How Should We Then Live?\\" by the late Francis Schaeffer, \\"How Now Should We Live?\\" by Chuck Colson and Nancy Percy (whom he quotes) and \\"The New Anti-Catholicism\\" by Philip Jenkins are more coherently argued and provide a better backdrop on the reason for the culture war.more coherently argued and provide a better backdrop on the reason for the culture war. <br /> <br />	2004-10-28

This is in my opinion, Lewis' greatest work (while I do wish it was a longer book).  The book is about letters from a senior demon (Screwtape) to his junior nephew and lesser demon, Wormwood.  Srewtape is Wormwood's uncle and supervisor and he is the Undersecretary for the Infernal Lowerarchy.<br /><br />In this book he is trying to present the temptation from the 'other point of view' - the demons.  It is through this unquie approach, that we find out about ourselves and our struggels with sin.  The story is set in the Second World War where there is a fight for a young Englishman's soul.<br /><br />This is just an outstanding work and while insightful, still very entertaining.

Written off his radio program with the same title and lectures given therefore, the book in essence is about the 'mere' or essential Christian doctrines in what Christians in all places and at all times agree on.  There is much common ground between Protestant Evangelicals, Catholics, and even Eastern Orthodox believers here; yet, not exstensively so.<br /><br />Many readers find his moral arguments one of the most compelling arguments for the existence of God.  While written over a half century ago, many Churches to this day still use his book in Bible studies and Sunday School education.<br /><br />His famous Trilema argument is still widely used (Jesus is either Lord, liar, or lunatic)and his discussion on the body of Christ and the diveristy it holds is a great balance between a 'totalitarian' religion or an 'individualistic' Christianity.  His discussion on 'begotten, not made' and the 'Trinity' is insightful and written for the laymen.<br /><br />While this is not my favoriate Lewis book, it still warrants five stars because of its ability to still reach the average person, well placed arguments, and influence it has had on the Christian community.	2004-10-02

While his first book, \\"Secrets of My Inner Strength\\", co-wriiten by Joe Hyamms covers some of the same material here, this book goes a little farther because, well, Chuck is a little older and many events in the last 15 years have occur to tell a little bit of a different story.<br /><br />The last Bio was written better from an entertainment point of view- mostly because Joe Hyamms is a great writer, but this book is a little less self congratulory.  Here Chuck admits his affair on his first wife in the 60's that produced a child, his divorce with Dianne, and his \\"living in sin\\" before marrying his current wife.  He admits his falleness as a fallen man, but also his re-newed faith in Christ in his journey to a more fulfilled life.<br /><br />The martial arts fan still learns much about his early martial arts training in Tang Soo Do while stationed in South Korea as a Security Policeman (of which I was also for 13 years, his early struggels in operating a dogo and tournament competition to enterng the film world and the Vietnam war and his family.<br /><br />The writing is a little light at times, but he hit his target audience just right.  For those who are looking for a more in-depth look at his martial arts film career, you may be disappointed and I agree that since much of his life is ceneter around his celebrity, he could have added another chapter discussing his films more in-depth (of wehich his other book did and therefore, he may not felt a need to do so). He talks about friends Bruce Lee and Bob Wall, his sons Mike and Eric, his new children, being a father husband and friend.  An enjoyable read.	2004-08-31

He reveals the controversies between the Latin West (Roman Catholicism), the Eastern Church (Eastern Orthodoxy) and the Protestant movements and their many divergent views.  He takes great care to present the facts, but also reveals the rumors and mystery of history, as well as history's strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Regardless of one's theological perspective on Mary and her place in the Christian life, this is must reading for anyone interested in doctrinal development throughout Christian history.  His chapter on the \\"second Eve\\" is clear, concise, yet thorough and accessible to both those who are lay people and academics.  This chapter naturally follows into the doctrine of the Theotokos and its importance in Marian doctrine; but more importantly, though not always stated, its importance in the doctrine of Christ.  Pelikan shows its development, again, concisely and clearly.<br /><br />Also, very interestingly, Pelikan takes the reader to a not very well known area by many Western Christians and that is the early place Mary held in Islamic cultures and how the Quran pictures her in extremely warming language that it rivals most material elsewhere found in that text.<br /><br />He does not shy away from the controversial aspects of Mariology as well, to include the bodily assumption, the apparitions, and the Immaculate Conception.  He shows how the doctrines developed and the problems each one caused between Protestants and Orthodox Christians.  Agreements and differences are discussed without making this book into an apologetic for one view or the other (not that apologetic material is wrong, but would have greatly side tracked this text).<br /><br />This is just another outstanding work of which I have had the pleasure to read.	2004-08-30

Schaeffer's last book before his death in 1984 is an examination of the accommodation of humanistic/secular ideas in the 'visible Church' which started with teh higher critical methods in the late 1800's, gained ground n the 1920's and 30's and led to a fruition in Western culture in 1960's and on.<br /><br />There are many points in this book that are worthy for all Christians to heed.  The book is very critical of liberal Chrsitian theology, but acknowledges where consrevative Chrsitians lost ground and the impending result of such mistakes by Evangelicals.<br /><br />Schaeffer correctly points out the creeping compromise of relativism in the Christian community and shows this most profoundly in the idea of divorce.  He writes about the consrevative schoalers of the 20's who produced the 'fundamentals', the social gospel, and the threat of secular/humanism and its devaluing of the sanicty of human life.<br /><br />He offers words of wisdom as wellthat Chrsitian must remember and strive for, to uphold the 'purity of the visble church' but no matter what we must also, 'show forth the love of God'.  There are so many good points here that asmall review cannot do this book justice.  Then why the for stars, well, Schaeffer fails to see that part of the problem is that he, although he might not agree, holds to the Barthian notion of a visble Church, but in Protestantism, there is no visble Church.  There are visble Christians, and the distinction is important because it often is the diffrence in the nethodology proposed. Otherwise an improtant work.	2004-08-28

He effectively deals with why Mary is called the Mother of God and the Nestorius controversy which climax at the Third Ecumenical Council and why denying Mary has Mother of God (Theotokos) also denies the full humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />He also deals effectively with the ever-virgin position as espoused by the Orthodox Church and he does so using scripture and building a concise and logical argument (ch. 3).<br /><br />He also speaks to the dangers of putting more on Mary than is revealed in the sriptures and early Church history.  He speaks to the errant teaching of sophia/marianism as espoused by a minority of Orthdoox Chrsitians such as Sergei Bulgakov aswell as the errant teachings of Latin/Rome theolgy of c0-reemptress.  Of course, much of the book, by teaching what Orthodox affirm about Mary, counter the gregious erros of Prottetsant theologies about Mary and their lack of following the Biblical mandate.<br /><br />While I do have some minor disagreements with the presentation of the material and not citing enough sources, this book works extermely well as a work to aid teh Orthodox Christian in learning more about Christ, Mary and why blessing her is important and how to give one's who do not understand Marian doctrine an answer.	2004-08-26

Hirokazu Kanazawa, President of Shotokan Karate-do International Federation, has complied an outstanding book that balances history and tradition with the different forms of kumite.  This book is not the normal primer. If one does not know at least the basic punches and kicks, do not get this book as a novice guide to learning karate.  Kanazawa's approach assumes the person has these basic techniques down.  If you are one of those people, still buy the book only if you plan on learning karate in the future when the opportunity arises.<br /><br />In addition, while this book is primarily a Shotokan text, he does review the major Okinawa/Japanese karate styles, goes over terminology, and a particularly nice paragraph on p. 19 on the \\"verbal greeting  `Oss'\\"  The photos are of high quality, which is important in a text that demonstrates many sparring steps via pictures.  The explanations are thorough enough to get the point a cross, but not unnecessarily tiresome and too detailed to loose the reader or make the book overly cumbersome.<br /><br />A nice companion martial texts to a martial artist's library.	2004-08-26

One of the reason for the brevity is the book was written in 1983 and the BKF was still a relatively recent organization (as most American organizations were, after all, they were longstanding if they had been around only 15-20 years at that time).<br /><br />They quickly go into exercises, 12 basic moves,  and the 27 nerves.  The photos are clear and easy to follow.  Their advice, though seldom given, is good advice for the novice.  The best thing about this book is having something in print by two American martial arts pioneers.	2004-08-22

I have been involved in the martial arts since 1977 and not being much of a kata enthusiast, have regulated this book to the self.  But as I get older and a couple of injuries later, I have discovered that in my case kata has a place at times to focus and get some martial exercise and keep the warrior spirit.  While I still prefer a more `ruff-n-tumble' martial direction, I did find this book praiseworthy.<br /><br />The history section of karate is clear, concise, yet detailed enough to not mislead the reader.  Yet, maybe due to his experience, he does go into an over the top polemic against the Tournament system.  First, I am well aware he is speaking about Japan and not America; but, the hard core systems from there have produced great athletes and damage to individuals has been minimized, probably a lot less than other sports like boxing.  His problem is in making an inductive fallacy by taking his experience and apply it to everywhere. (p. 27, 28)<br /><br />Otherwise, this book is pretty good and even though kata is not my strong suite, I did enjoy the book.  Kata is explained by words and photos, and the photos are very sharp, which is needed when using photos to teach movements.  While I'll probably never be a huge fan of kata, I can appreciate the history, exercise, and place it still has in the warrior tradition.	2004-08-21

Normally, I loved his work or find it well, not very good - this is almost a split between the two.  At times, this book was extremely interesting, yet, the sections within each chapter often read slowly because of a choppy style.<br /><br />He covers the major postulations in the Pensees and his commentary is usually right on, albeit at times forgettable.  One should read Pascal's Pensees besides this book. Even though Pascal's Pensees are throughout the book, it is still important to read Pascal's book in total without commentary and then also use this book as a reference.<br /><br />The strongest chapter is Kreeft's explanation on faith and reason and has a ring of C.S. Lewis as well (of whom Kreeft has also written a spectacular book on titled \\"C.S. Lewis for the Third Millennium\\").  This book is definitely worth the purchase price despite some minor irritations and at times less than enthusiastic reading.	2004-08-21

White book I had read a few years ago, \\"The Roman Catholic Controversy.\\"  In this book, James White tries to demonstrate first the difference between Catholics and Protestants and that those differences do matter (hence a subtitle often book).  There are some problems with this subtitle in that Protestantism is so divided among themselves, even in the Evangelical camps, that defining a Protestant can be difficult in and of itself because the category is so broad; however, White does narrow on what type of Protestant he is addressing, those who accept `sola scriptura' and `by grace thru faith alone' salvation rallying cries.<br /><br />First, White does do a good job in demonstrating why if one accepts his position (mostly Reformed Faith believers), then the differences do matter.  He writes well on his position on what sola scriptura is and he is not as vitriolic as he was in Mary Another Redeemer?  The failures are in his inability to adequately deal with passages that speak of tradition.  He tends to focus on passages that speak of tradition in a poor light and does so fairly accurately, but in the chapter  titled \\"The Thousand Traditions\\" he attacks the `oral traditions' and claims that `\\"The guiding factor for development of Christian doctrine is the Bible itself!\\" (p. 83)  White, fails however, to satisfactorily show that sola scriptura is even in scriptura and he does not account for over three hundred years of Church history, without the canon of scripture.  In addition, the Church taught the gospel of Christ, without a word written in today's scripture for at least 20 years or so when Paul wrote his first book and the canon was not closed until probably 90 AD until John wrote his revelation.<br /><br />White fails miserably to account for this lag of a Church or Christian community without a scripture.  Further, it was tradition and church approval, guided by the Holy Spirit that produced the canon Protestants read today (further,  I assert that the Bible is more reverenced than read among Evangelicals, Catholics, and Orthodox). While I have problems with Rome as well, I first found this book unconvincing and still do.  He sees the debate through such a narrow prism, that he fails to recognize the inconsistency in his debate on Rome's `scripture and tradition' compared to his 'sola scriptura', both of which are incorrect.  Scripture is an outgrowth of Church tradition as the Church determined the canon while being guided by the Holy Spirit.canon Protestants read today (further,  I assert that the Bible is more reverenced than read among Evangelicals, Catholics, and Orthodox).

White, Reformed Protestant Apologist, has written another book in a series of anti-Catholic Church books.  The title thesis, Mary Another Redeemer? Assumes White is going to deal head one with this issue and while a backdrop of Marian history is important, White often travels on theological and journalistic shaky ground by setting up red herrings in one place and when convenient, not in another (just to name one problem).  For example, in his chapter on the \\"Mother of God\\" White sets the stage by going to the controversy that established the name Theotokos.  He is write, that one of the reason, if not primary, for the term was to establish and confirm Jesus divinity and humanity.  But, he looses credibility when he makes comments in regards to Nestorius, the person who opposed the term, that \\"he was eventually condemned as a heretic; we have doubt as to whether we have a completely accurate (or fair) view of his beliefs...\\" (p. 47)  Who is we? Most scholars do not really doubt Nestorius' position much like most scholars do not doubt Arius position at the Council of Nicea.  White, however, would not make the same charge against the Catholic Church in regards to Arius because, I think, he agrees with the doctrines established.  It is a misleading comment.<br /><br />Further, he speaks of the misuses of the term, but he is wrong on many counts.  While there are people who misuse the term, one cannot use the term only to describe Jesus' nature on one hand, but disregard it in the person who the titled is given to on the other (Mary).  Most Catholic and Orthodox who use the term never, never think that Mary gave rise to Jesus divinity; but the term is used to call Mary blessed as scripture demands!<br /><br />While I agree with his main points about the movement in some Catholic circles who are trying to have the Catholic Church official call Mary Co-redeemer, his book, it could be argued, demonstrates that even with this heretical movement, the Roman Church has not made this view, under pressure, a doctrine - because the Roman Church sees that the co-redeemer status is incorrect.  The movement is a problem, and Rome should be more aggressive in combating it, but White's book is largely a Reformed position that looks at the conspiracy more than the data.  Rome has not adopted the doctrine in 2000 years, and while the movement has its supporters, it probably is not going to adopt this doctrine any time soon.h has not made this view, under pressure, a doctrine - because the Roman Church sees that the co-redeemer status is incorrect.

Spong often says things like, \\"Indeed, the concept of virgin birth itself...is today quickly dismissed in scholarly circles.\\"  (p.45)  Repeating phrases like this does not make it so - while many scholars do consider the virgin birth narratives to be either false, a myth, or something of the kind, many other scholars do not.  Spong must know this, but like his previous works, only seems to throw the name scholar around based on naturalistic presuppositions.<br />While there are passages in the Bible that many fundamentalists and other Christians often do not wrestle with because of the apparent contradictions or other dilemmas, Spong uses many such passages without placing them in the proper context because many of these contradictions have been answered by other theologians and philosophers.  Further, he forgets, or more than likely, intentionally hides the fact that some passages in scripture are used with an anthropomorphic idiom such as Joshua's sun stopping in the sky.  Spong claims this cannot be true because the sun does not evolve around the earth, demonstrating here that the Bible is incorrect because a divine book got the structure of the universe wrong.  I wonder if he is this hard on our modern weather man or woman who nightly, all across Western Civilization, provides the times the sun will set and raise each day.  His analyses of Greek mythical writing infused with early Hebrew writing is spurious at best and has been handled elsewhere by more competent scholars than Spong and so I refer one to Ronald Nash's book on the \\"Greeks and the Gospels\\" here at Amazon to show the true influence and lack there of in regards to the New Testament.<br />Further, Spong either received a poor graduate education in theology or is distorting the historic and current development of doctrine.  For example, he asserts that earliest interpretations of the Christ death in purely an Anselmian doctrine when stating that \\"God send his emissary, and through the son's divine sacrifice the justice of God had been satisfied (p. 36).\\"  But this is just false; the righteousness/justice of God was developed in the 12th Century by St. Anselm in his famous \\"Why God Became Man\\" (this writing can also be bought by Amazon with \\"The Selected Writings of Saint Anselm\\" by Brian Davies) as an apologetic. The early Church had many different interpretations on Christ death (atonement/ransom/victory,etc).<br />Lastly, to keep this review short, it must be stated that Spong is unconvincing in trying to convince the reader that the gospels are midrash; they are not, but instead economian (biographic style writing popular at the time) writings and in addition, the gospels added to the worth of women, not their degradation.  Women are considered equal witness to Christ resurrection (one could argue superior witnesses than to the apostles) as are men.  The Catholic and Orthodox Churches have held Mary, the Theotokos (Barer of God or Mother of God), to such high esteem, that she is the model of obedience and holiness for the entire human race.  I wish I could answer in this small format all the false propagnada Spong assert, but space limits us here.  Spong once again is just wrong, but entertainingly so.nd current development of doctrine.

While he may overstate the matter about the influence of the novels (for example, my wife read them yet does not hold to any dispensationalists view), he is correct in saying that many have been influenced by the books.  This influence isn't a bad thing, because many have come to Christ or have at least been intrigued by Christianity.<br />The book functions best, as a work for Christians in general, and Catholics in particular to give good answers the may receive from dispensationalists and others interested in the rapture theory.  He concisely informs the reader about the history of the dispensationalists' theory as developed by Darby and deals with the major teachings by Hal Lindsey, John Hagee and Tim LaHay.<br />I do think Olson should have dealt with the \\"Catholic Vision\\" on revelation and end-time events more thoroughly.  He devotes a small chapter to this book on the subject, and here alone he could have added a couple of chapters and still kept the information concise and interesting. Further, being Eastern Orthodox I have a very small amount of knowledge on the prevelant Catholic eschatological outlook and was interested to read more. All in all a good book	2004-06-22

There have been many fine reviews of the book.  Well, then write another review?  First, a previous review in June 04 must be corrected, in telling that the author should spend more time in the \\"hood\\" presumes to know too much about the author; after all, maybe the author does spend a lot of time in the hood.  Secondly, such a statement in no way negates the message and arguments presented in the book.  As an example, I do not have to travel to Gettysburg to know some fundamental facts and truths about the battle that took place.  In addition, while living among a subset in an overall culture is helpful in understanding the conditions of which one lives and in developing a heart for the people one comes to live with, it does not negate the solutions to the problems.<br /><br />Although there are some passages in the book I disagree in part with such as his chapter on the \\"N\\" word and general broad swipes he makes about certain things, it is worthy of great respect. I think his chapter on Profiling is very good, but I do wish he would have put a little more responsibility on the neighborhoods themselves; he tends to place some of the blame on the war on drugs, but I don't think he provides a cogent argument against eliminating this policy or even the prospect if it should be eliminated.  This should have been drawn out a little further, possibly in two chapters.  With this aside, the chapter is otherwise excellent.  He writes about \\"getting past\\" the race issue and it is here that the chapter succeeds.<br /><br />His chapter on the \\"reparations movements\\" is probably the best essay I have read on the subject.  Even though the author David Horowits devoted an entire book on the subject, I think this chapter is more direct and he shows how a re-payment in sorts has already taken place in the 1960s welfare movement instituted by President Johnson.<br /><br />His chapter on \\"We Don't Know Our Own History\\" is simply outstanding.  He makes a perceptive and insightful observation that white America has become \\"blacker\\" in the years which is evident in such things as music (his examples are from Elvis Presley to Britney Spears).  This, he asserts and I concur, is a form of flattery.<br /><br />Another very strong chapter is on Black Academics, which is largely focus on the Prof. Cornel West incident at Harvard a couple of years back.  I remember at the time thinking exactly what McWhorter writes.  The author here is dead on in dealing with the subject.  His last chapter is too short but very powerful.  It involves three people who are examples of black leadership and that the black community should not be looking for pone black leader - but I assert, by writing about three black people, of whom he is not always in agreement on all items, he demonstrates that each black person themselves should be leaders.  They can all make a difference if the can get past being the puppets of the leftists agenda.<br /><br />Lastly, McWhorter is unfairly, I think labeled a conservative.  Although he is not a leftists, he like many people, holds to some conservative views (against reparations) and some liberal ones (pro-abortion, although to what extent I do not know).

By the time I reached the end, when the book started to pick up steam again, I lost almost any interesting his assertion. His first three chapters in part I of his book are very engrossing.  He crafts nicely his thesis about sin and horror.  His focus on the Shelly's and their beliefs and practice lifestyle and how it affected her writing of Frankenstein is marvelous, and while I do not know if I completely buy his assertion, it is extremely plausible.  His chapter on Stoker and Dracula is also very well done, but mid way through Part II when we get to the 1920s and Germany, he does not craft his arguments and insights as well.  The book begins to drag I think he begins to make some overstatements about the condition of the time in regards to sexual liberation and homosexuality.  While these behaviors had an impact on Germany after WW I, other problems persisted to weaken Germany as well, and more importantly, the liberal theology espoused prior to WWI and during it, as well as a 100 years of liberal German philosophy and theology weaken any moral fabric, allow a place for a Hitler to rise.  Of course other problems are there as well, but Jones focuses so much on European decadence that he loses sight on demonstrating horror fictions part in the process.  While his assessment is interesting, he seems to be off track from what the reader is expecting.	2004-06-21

It is an interesting read as father, who has no understanding of the military, becomes closer immersed in it and finds that he has more in common with others, some old friends and some new ones.  He also sees the snobbish side of our country, who ignorantly feel that the military is a haven for rift raft.  Cpl Schaeffer discovers that his dad was wise in many areas of life.<br />It was also neat to see that Mrs. Schaeffer (referred to as Genie in the book) is a calming influence in the entire matter.<br />Lastly, I have never called out people before in a review, but to Andrew and Albert, I wonder if you read the book with an open eye.  The book is not about &quot;war stories&quot; and the military does not turn one into a &quot;robot&quot; (matter of fact, like the book demonstrates, the military, just not the corps, is one of the few places one will find many people from many different walks of life who aspire to do many different things).	2004-05-30

There is much in the political realm where Mr. Forest and I disagree, but putting differences aside, his book here is a wonderful work.<br />His introduction page, about him and his wife receiving a rare and beautiful icon of Mary and their reverence in opening it grabs the faithful reader immediately.  One wants to discover what makes icons so special.  As an Orthodox Christian, I found his opening statements to be reverent and exciting.  He brilliantly gives a concise but needed history on icons since many people have no idea why there are icons.  He writes about how icons are a \\"transmission of Christian tradition and faith\\" and how they are \\"an aid to worship.\\"  The reader will further learn how icons are made, the prayer of the iconographer and the importance of icons in the life of the Christian faith.<br />The pictures in the book of various icons are a great aid and are intertwined nicely in the text (some color and some black and white photos).  A great buy for any Christian and in particular the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox faithful.	2004-05-26

Books	4	14	22	N	N	Accomplishes What It Sets Out To Do	This book is rather a small booklet rebutting the spurious and silly story line presented in Brown's popular bestseller, \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"  The authors state why the book, that rebutts a fictional writings, is so imporatnt and they quickly make their case.  I for one, have ran into several people asserting this book as a novel based on fact.<br />This pamphlet works because it is small, concise, and inexpensive.  I have been hard on Hanegraaff in the past for small books that are nothing more than religious tracks, but this time, the price is right and it accomplsihes what it sets out to do.  There is so much to refute in Brown's book, but it does not take a lot of study to do it.  Actually, absurdity normally does not take much detial answers.<br />Maier opens the track up with \\"The Da Vinci Deception.\\"  He concisely and effectively refutes the book and shows it as the fiction it is.  Hanegraaff's \\"What is Truth\\" section is equaly imporatnt and here, serves its purpose.  There are however, two negatives I want to touch on: (1) Maier could have spend a little more time in his section, in particular on the Council of Nicea and the Apostolic Fathers  (although he does a good and quick job in assaulting the silliness of Brown's book).  (2)I don't understand why a simple book to write took so long to be published?  After all, I have effectively dismantled Brown's book in discussions with serval friends and could have written this same track in a coupel of days.  With CRI's resources, I think they should have been on the cutting edge and got this book out months ago.<br />Small booklet, but very effective.	2004-05-23

Books	4	12	17	N	N	A Reasonable Faith	Physical Scientist, Henry Schaefer, has written a book, largerly based of his lectures at Universities, about the true nature of science in its relation to reason, Christianity and truth.  The main aim of this book, is not to trench through all the technological and scientific detials that have been tried elsewhere, but instead demonstrate through history and science that one can, and often many are, highly intellectual scientist who are also faithful, practicing Christians.<br /><br />He uses history to show that the founding scientist who have laid the foundation of scientific discovery and thought were in fact Christians and pursued their vocations because they believed that God created a wold in which they could invetiagte according to rational governing laws.  He also mentions the many Christian-scientists today who are among the elite in their professions, therefore discounting the often spread myth that those who espouse a creation model of any sort are fundamentalists Christians and not \\"really\\" scientists.<br /><br />He does mention certian scientific discoveries that lead one to conclude that their is a God and easily shows the folly and highjacking of science terminology buy many atheists such as Dawkins and Huxley.  At times, his words overlap (due to it being based on his lectures) and he could have spent more time on certian scientific data and concepts that are widely distorted or misunderstood by both evolutionists and young earth creationists.  I wish he had of went into more detials why he was not a young earth creationists because this is a point of contention within the non-evolutionists camp.  All in all, a good book.	2004-05-23

While surfing around, I stumbled here to check out a couple of reviews and noticed some with astonishing errors; either due to a lack of writing a detailed review or just not understanding Kant's ideas.  The problem may also lie in that anthologies don't carry the full selection of a person's arguments (although with one reviewer it is just an obvious case of silly ignorant ramblings)<br />Wood's book is readable and it is true that Kant is never an easy read, but neither are most Prussian Philosophers of the same era.<br />Whatever Kant's metaphysical faults are, he is not a relativist, but tried, although many have asserted unsuccessfully, to construct an objective moral framework on reason alone (although Kant did believe in God and asserted that the Christian religion was the closet to a true objective construct; however, that is precisely the problem of anthologies, because all they do is give one a snap shot of someone's work.  Further, Kant asserted God as a practical necessity if humans were going to reach the highest good (summum bonum).<br />Lastly, is trying to limit the role of reason to make room for faith.  He limits knowledge by demonstrating that reason belongs in the empirical realm (phenomenal) and the things-in-itself are actually in the noumenal world beyond the reach of the senses.  For someone as lengthy as Kant, short reviews cannot do justice.  If one gets this book, then they should also get \\"The Cambridge Companion to Kant\\" also sold on Amazon and edited by Kant scholar Guyer.	2004-05-06

Gresham Machen provided the academic world with the standard text for teaching Koine (common) Greek, often called New Testament Greek. This book is extremely well done, and after viewing two three separate Greek texts, this is the most detailed. He covers all the rules in Greek such as declensions, Present Actives, Participles, aorists, imperfects, Perfect tenses, subjunctives, etc. His vocabulary section in the back is great for the student as a quick reference or study tool for memorization. Further, as another reviewer noted, one can practice what they have learned in each chapter with Greek to English and English to Greek exercises. This is more difficult book than Mounce's text if one was trying to learn Greek alone. With a minor in Greek, I suggests one seek a teacher or someone with at least two years of Greek if using a book to learn Greek anyway.	2004-04-30

Moreland and William Lane Craig, both currently teaching at Biola University have collaborated on a philosophical encyclopedia of sorts to introduce philosophy and logic to the Christian public.  This book is written for people who may have had no philosophy, a little philosophy or maybe as a quick reference resource for those who have had intermediate or advanced training.<br />Philosophers, whether one likes it or not, have contributed, both for good and bad, to such an extent in this world that knowing basic terms, ideas, arguments, and ideas is essential for Christians so that we can dialogue with others, including other Christians who may have a different perspective on a Varity of issues.<br />The first chapter is brilliant in introducing certain terms and ideas as expressed in the arena of ideas.  If there is a weak chapter, it is the next one which is on argumentation and logic.  It is actually very good, but in comparison to Geisler's and Brooks' \\"Come Let Us Reason\\", it comes up a little short; but I throw this in there, just to point out, that its weakest chapter is actually very good.<br />The book deals very well with Skepticism and metaphysics.  Also they tackle some ideas that many Christians assume are axiomatic, however, many skeptics have serious questions and chapters like \\"Personal Identity and Life After Death,\\"  \\"Scientific Methodology,\\" the chapters on ethics are just outstanding.  While they only scratch the surface in these discussions, they do so in a way that provides a full content of information for the reader has a well rounded backdrop for further study or even conversation.	2004-04-15

This is simply a great \\"readers' encyclopedia\\" for the C.S. Lewis reader.  All of his material is dealt with; but this book is so worth the low price because it goes beyond the usual commentary about what influenced Lewis with this book or that poem.  Instead, the editors took pains to ensure that the C.S. Lewis fan would see how, whether negatively or positively, other people and ideas affected his writings, lectures, thoughts, and positions.<br />We read how Sigmund Freud, Thomas Aquinas, G.E.M. Anscombe, William Shakespeare, Hume, and of course J.R.R. Tolkien played into his thoughts and discussions.  Further, how he viewed such ideas as evolution, capital punishment, democracy, and tradition are also discussed.  The list goes on and on.  This book is also a steel - economically speaking.  There are not many hardbound books of this quality going for such an inexpensive price.<br />This book is just a wealth of information and a joy for any C.S. Lewis fan.	2004-04-15

This book succeeds where his early work, also reviewed by me, failed.  His other book was a sequential photo book with very little written information.  Relying primarily on the visual approach, it did not get into the serious thoughts on fighting application.<br /><br />Further, the biographical section of the latter book also was a little disappointing.  This book helps redeems Joe Lewis' efforts.  First, the books primary objective is established in the titled and the text gives the reader the information necessary to understand many of the most important fighting concepts.  Although the information presented has been presented elsewhere, Joe succeeds in communicating the ideas to where the novice to intermediate fighter can easily understand the material and should be able, with the help of a partner, learn and develop the advice into their own martial repertoire.  While there are some photographs displaying some of the concepts the material strength is in the writing and it surpasses other books that have tried to deal with some of Bruce Lee's concepts.  The strongest chapters are \\"The Science of Movement\\", The Art of Distancing\\", \\"The Explosive Initial Move,\\" and \\"Angular Attack.\\"<br />The extras in this book are a nice surprise in that they give one a break from the study of fighting material and allow the reader to get an understanding of Bruce Lee and Joe Lewis from the perspective of others, most of whom are great martial artist in their own right.  Chapters I particularly enjoyed were by Dan Inosanto, John Korab, Gene Lebell, and Bob Wall.  Even some of the contributions I did not necessarily like (Mike Stones' piece) I did think it was honest and fair to put the essay in the book.<br />This is a good book and achieves what it sets out to do; which is to simply explain some of the innovations and ideas pioneered by Bruce Lee and Joe Lewis.it sets out to do; which is to simply explain some of the innovations and ideas pioneered by Bruce Lee and Joe Lewis.	2004-04-12

This book works as a primer for Christians, particularly those who have had very little training dealing with other sects, atheists, and evoluntionary thought.  The book fails in that the answers are a little to &quot;pat.&quot;<br />All in all, it accomplsihes what it sets out to do: give Christians quick answers like those he gives on the radio; however, a larger book, with those quick answers as an opening then followed by more theology would be better.<br />Hank has a gift for communicating easy ansers for tough questions, but lacks taking his genius to the next level.  His first two books were outstanding, since then the best he has done is average works like this one, with brief great moments, some missed opprotunities, and ultimately medicore works.<br />I recommend the book, but hopeful it will spark Christians to study further and more rigorist works.	2004-04-02

(Student Library) (The Student Library)	Books	4	32	38	N	N	Excellent Introduction into the Subject	Ron Nash's book is more than an introduction into the topic of Christainity and the Mystery Religions of the Greco-Roman world, but not so detialed as to loose the laymen.  Although most scholars, including liberals, have now discounted a complete comparision between Christianity and Mystery Religions, a small, but vocal neo-pagan and feminists goddess practiciners have re-ignited the debate, partly I think due to the openness of comminication provided bt the internet.<br />This book introduces the major issues invol and places emphasis in three areas: (1) Hellenistic Philosophy, (2) The Mystery Religions, (3) Christianity and Gnosticism.<br />All sections involve clear, concise, yet thorough refutation of many Christian/mystery religions as proposed by some individuals, some of whom are academics largely behind the most current standings in the debate.  Further, Nash, in order to provide a road map, uses the introducing paragraphs for each chapter brillantly.  He gives a clear objective statement and explains where he'll be heading with the material.  This I think helps in a text likes this and demonstrates that Nash is knowldgeable on how to present possible new material to people (for many, this is probable the first they have read about the subject).<br />He also provides a great selection of resource material on the subject.  His endnotes provides nice explanations when neccessary and he also has additional non-cited footnotes to give a little additional, though non-esential information.<br />There is one small crticisms of the book and it is significant enough to deduct a star.  Nash barely deals with the idea of defication among many mystery cults and the Christian tradition.  He largely glosses over this section almost forgetting that much of Christainity does practice a deifciation commonly called \\"theosis.\\"  He settles to quickly with the Western idea of salvation in refuting salvific issues.  While I think it is propoer of him to use this approach, he relies to heavily upon it.  The Eastern Tradition is different than the mysetry cults teachings in this area, and a solid refutation here would have been helpful I think for Eastern Christians, regardless if Nash agrees with the Eastern tradition of theosis or not  (since Nash is a Reformed Protetstant, I think he probably would not agree with the theosis doctrine, but nonetheless, it was a teaching of the early Church and is distinct from the mystery cults idea of union with God.<br />A must have book for any Christian who wants to learn more about this subject!ies to heavily upon it.

Joshi's book is a text built on the selected writings of mostly famous atheists (while some writers would self identify as agnostics, as well as probably one diest and one non-church Chritsian).  There are always inherent problems with selected writings in that articles or essays are most often taken away from the larger texts in which they were written - this tends to only superficially highlight certain ideas and arguements are not as solid as they could or should be.<br />The selected writings themselves would warrant three stars.  They are a fair selection showing a diverse perspective on issues relating to atheism aganist theism in general and Christianity in particular.  No one essay is exceptional as arguments go, but there are a couple of decent ones.  Anthoy Flew, a gaint in atheistic philosphy and a bona fide philospher, presents a primer essay on immortality (the best essay in this section of the book). Darrow's essay against &quot;Lord Day&quot; laws is also a fine essay written with precision and skill.<br />There are, however, many other essays that are just too small and removed from the larger body of work that the points are not really either well established are in proper context (David Hume in particular) or many are just downright atheistic propaganda (Mencken, Ingersoll, and Vidal are the obvious suspects here).<br />As with the arguemnts presented in the selected writings there are valid agruments in the refutation of each position from many philosphers who are theists (in particular Christians).  I would recommend that anyone who reads this book read the larger works of some of these people, especially those who are most influencial in the realm of atheistic arguements such as Bertrand Russell, Anthony Flew, Friedrich Nietzsche, and John Stuart Mill. Further, one should read David Hume whom I would not classify as an atheists - most Hume scholars tend to think at best he was an agnostic and probably a deists.  His writings, though not often consistent (miracle/physical world debate) are the standard for many atheistic positions.<br />The introduction is worth one star.  It is so rought with straw men, silly attacks, and distortions that one wonders what Joshi was trying to do.  He uses many of the straw men famous by many atheists that it is tiresome.  Amoung many are the science (evolution and big bang) topic that he completely, and I assert intentially, misunderstands and therefore mis-represents (I say intentially because Joshi is not a dumb man and therefore I think he must choose to misunderstand).  It is so overly polemic that some good points he does make like the &quot;way of life&quot; and &quot;morality&quot; assertions are easily forgotten in a mire of much rambling speech.<br />I would encourage all, atheists and theists alike to read better works on the subject by atheists or agnostics.  Two good primers (although I disagree with them)  are &quot;The Atheist's Debater Handbook&quot; and &quot;the Case Against God&quot;  Primary source writings by Hume and Mill are also good places to start.

I read this book in giving Carlton another chance (a re-reading of the &quot;The Way&quot; only entrenced my position).<br />Carlton's book here is better and less polemic than the other &quot;The Way.&quot;  Further, it provides valuable information about Orthodoxy.  The book does have some weaknesses.  He still does not spend enough time on &quot;theosis.&quot;  This is such a central teaching that it surprises me that he does not cover it more fully; however, there are many strengths in this book.<br />First, he does a masterfull job in expalining many Orthodox postions such as the incarnation, the Trinity, and the Creation event.  The purpose of a book for catechums is to provide the faith in a nutshell, while still providng enough information for serious study and later development.  This he does well.  Secondly, after most sections, there is a &quot;reflection&quot; page with simple, but important questions that the reader or leader of the study can use to reflect on the material and more.<br />He presents well written chapters on the structure of the church, baptism, and even monasticism should answer most inquiers' questions.  Another weakness, is arguably a strength (depending on the audience). Many chapters are too short and require more depth; however, for most begginers or inquirers, the length anf explainations are probably just about right and used with supplemental material, this is a decent, although not a comprehensive tool, for inquirers about the teachings of Orthodoxy.	2003-12-31

His strength in theological reflections is in the liturgy and editor Thomas Fisch nicely gathers the right material for this expose on Father Schmemanns thoughts on the Eucharists in particular and the liturgy in general.<br />The introduction is written by Fisch and concisely puts into perspective Fr. Schmemann's work on this topic. The next couple of essay is by Bernard Botte, O.S.B. and W. Grisrooke who are essentially debating Fr. Schmemann on the &quot;Role of Liturgical Theology&quot; and liturgical reform in particular.  Fr. Schmemann's response is nicely argued.<br />The chapter &quot;Liturgy and Theology&quot; is a wonderful section on returning the liturguy to its theology.  In Eastern Orthodoxy, there are not endless amounts of separating important ideas, but instead, a life of intergration of the entire Christian expierence and liturgy is theology.  &quot;Theology and Eucharist&quot; is also an outstanding chapter that speaks about the Church and the Eucharists as &quot;a passage, a procession leading the Church into heaven into her fulfillment as the Kingdom of God&quot;  (p. 82)<br />This is a must read for anyone interested in sacramental theology and Eastern Orthodoxy.	2003-11-29

The book is in two parts with three essays in both parts.<br />The first section, is where Dr. Craig proposes his reasons for faith in God.  Dr. Sinnot-Armstrong gives a rebuttle and Craig rebuttles.  In the section section, Dr. Sinnott-Armstrong gives an essay for atheism, Dr. Craig rebutts, and Sinnott-Armstrong rebutts.<br />The only real flaws in the book are that both do not really settle anything.  They write past each other often enough as to not always tackel the most revelant assertions. Further, no one  deals a &quot;death-=blow&quot; to the other.  But this is telling - since debates are not where the issues always lie.  Although I like philosophy and apologetics, issues of God normally are found in the lives of others.<br />All in all, Graig wins because his standard to achieve victory is less.  He asserts that theism is reasonable. Dr. Sinnott-Armstrong could provide an adequate argument to refute the reasonableness of Dr. Graigs points.  Dr. Sinnott-Armstrong's standard is much more difficult to achieve although he tries to lessen the burden by asserting he is not making &quot;proofs in the mathmatical sense.&quot;  Here he is trying to discard the &quot;universial negative&quot; principle.  Dr. Sinnot-Armstrong also makes the general &quot;Crusades straw-man&quot; arguement and it backfires because Dr. Craig is able to then introduce &quot;atheists&quot; philosophies that killed more people and that were the logical outworkings of these belief systems.	2003-11-22

Matthew traces his humble begginings as a child who feels God's presence, to his conversion as a child to Seventh Day Adventism.  Interesting enough, one of my reasons for leaving Adventism is similar to Gallatin's in that it involved  the issue of &quot;clean and unclean&quot; foods as well.  He then converts to the &quot;Sunday&quot; Protesttant lifestyle (yes, Adventists are Protestants like Charismatics, Baptists, etc).<br />This becomes a central point to Matthew, in that church's of the Protetstant tradition rely on &quot;sola scriptura&quot; which ultimately means &quot;I.&quot;  It involves how &quot;I&quot; interpret the Bible.  This method fails to produce comprehensive truth for it makes man's interpretation of scripture more important than what God is actually saying.  He devotes a lot of pages to the self-centerdness of modern Protestant Christianity  (although it may be unintentioned by the Christian).<br />He gives a great apologetic for Eucharist, the Liturgy, and prayer.  His chapters on Mary and the Saints are a little too small; Because so many Protetstants  are mis-informed or just don't undertsand the issues here, that stronger chapters should have been developed here.  Overall, this book is much better than most in mixing &quot;biographical&quot; infomration and &quot;apologetic&quot; material together.	2003-11-18

Though a previous reviewer thinks Goerge uses general statements (I'm paraphasing here), I think George tries, and for the most part is succesful in developing a construct on what is secular orthodox in his first chapter.  He even includes a good exchange with a secualrists John Dever and avoids traditioanl straw men arguments.  Unlike many books that try and reach new heights in polemics, George keeps the tone fairly academic, while still asserting writing style that is enjoyable.<br />He correctly identifies people like John Rawls and Ronald Dworkin as liberal theorists who support a culture of death.  Further, he includes Peter Singer, who chairs the bioethics program at Prineton as a proponent of the &quot;Culture of Death.&quot;  Yes, Singer and others are probably the extreme, but George is demonstarting that ideas have consequences and that they are only a little removed from the liberal secular perspective.<br />The book slows done when one enters the section of &quot;The Courts.&quot;  This section is well written and necessary, but a little dry.  His strongest chapter here is &quot;Natural Law and Human Rights.&quot;<br />His chapter on &quot;The Church&quot; is extremely well written.  Although he draws heavely from Catholic traditions, all traditional Christians can agree with the depraved state he writes about, although they may disagree on the approach needed to stay the course.	2003-10-23

He quickly shows the two phases of ideas that helped shaped American's anti-intellectual (1700-Civil War and Civil War to the present).  Of course, most who read the book will be more familar with the more contempory arguements.<br />The book is an easy read but does suffer from being to short.  The chapters are not very long and the arguements are not quite laid out well enough.  Although I agree with him, I think he should ahve written a more detialed book; however, I may be wrong in assuming too much.  It may be that he was just writing a quick primer for a culture knee deep in intellectual mediocrity, and anything else may loose their attention.	2003-10-23

At moments I really enjoyed the book, however, other chapters were quite boring.  The book, however, reads easily and therefore, boring sections are not as tiresome as they could have been.  This book, like other books of this genre, is often \\"choppy\\" because one chapter does not always natuarlly lead to the next topic.<br />There are some good things in this book, that take the less than satisfactory parts and raise this book to at least an average rating (although, one is probably better off waiting until the book is out in paperback).  Her chapter on the Death Penality is, I think, briilant.  She avoids the extremes, by paying close attention to real issues about poor defences, fair trials, yet deserved punishment.  She supports the death penailty, but thinks the system needs to make sure it provides the best defence possible for all.  She is not satisfied that public defenders offices are underfunded, while prosecutors often operate a larger budget in which to prosecute the case.  Her concern is for the innocent person, but she also admits that the guilty must be punished.<br />Her chapter on Loyality\\" is also very good as she writes about her work at CNN and the FNC and her transition from one to the other as discussed by others.  Further, her chapter on patriotism is also very good and she arguments hear, though said elsewhere, is needed (support the men and women in uniform).<br />The book is less interesting in other areas like her chapter on her plastic surgery.  While I suspect others my enjoy this chapter and others chapters as well, I thought the pace of the book slowed and that its transitions from topic to topic were cumbersome.<br />All in all, an enjoyable read, though not a compelling one.	2003-08-30

In this book, Carl Sagan addresses the validity of ideas such as aliens, ghosts, faith healers, and psychics - just to name a few. The first half of the book is outstanding, and though I may disagree on some minor details, all in all, it is a much needed work for a generation lost in the fine art of critical thinking.<br /><br />Sagan then goes on to discuss critical thinking in \\"The Fine Art of Baloney Detection.\\"  This chapter is a strength and it is here that he quickly, but very intelligently tells the reader how to develop a 'baloney detector kit.'  He discusses everything from 'Occum's Razor', ad hominem, and argument from authority (unfortunately, Sagan often himself has failed in this area himself, but one cannot be to hard on him, he tells the reader how to spot it).  Though this chapter is not completely exhaustive, it is probability all someone just introduced to the subject could handle at once.<br /><br />Further, Sagan, who was always quick to criticize others, also takes a stab at showing the reader his own mistakes as a scientist and how sometimes his biases would get in the way of clear thinking.  I have read some of Sagan's other books and have always been impressed with his skill at conveying information in fiction and non-fiction.  I have most often disagreed with him and in this book, I sometimes think he goes beyond logic and science himself.  However, this is still an excellent book.	2003-08-21

He brings up some valuable insights about certain mysteries in the Church. What is also good about this book are chapters and points that not all Orthodox Chrsitains agree on, but that the Church has allowed room for discussion like 'universial salvation' (or rather, the mystery and hope that all may be saved).<br />The slowest chapter is the first one, where Bishop Ware writes about his conversion into the Church.  Though it is interesting, his other chapters are just that much better that his first one pales in comparision.  His chapter on repentance is a must as the role of the priest, the sinner, and God are explained as well as &quot;the gift of tears.&quot;<br />Bishop Ware's writing style is formal and yet, pastoral.  This is very evident in the chapetrs &quot;Silence in Prayer: the Meaning of Hesychia&quot; and  &quot;A Sense of Wonder.&quot;  Here he takes both theological ideas and explains their importance where the reader can instantly grasp and begin to immediately live these important concepts.  In a &quot;Sense of Wonder&quot; he briefly discusses the Orthodox view on a college education (one could say an education in general); this topic is rarely discussed in Orthodoox texts and it is needed and appropiate in this chapter.<br />His chapter on spiritual guides is both important for the Lay person and it is good advice for a priest (more than likely, a priest has already been given such advice in seminary).  This book is wonderful and should be read by all Orthodox Christains, with a special focus on new converts or cradle Orthodox who have never really studied the writings of Orthodox academics.	2003-08-13

John Sparks's book is easy to understand, well organized, and a must for all Christians, whether Orthodox, Catholic, or Protestant.

This story involves the Daredevil's indenity being exposed for al to see.  The press hounds Matt for the truth and they report the 'Kingpin is Dead.'<br />The Kingpin's appearant demise (and apearant is the operative word) was maters-minded by an up-and-coming punk named Mr. Silke.  He is a visitor to Hell's Kitchen from Chicago and the opening scene, taken from Shakespear's 'Julius Ceaser' is interesting.<br />I don't want to review the story as to give anything a way.  The Kingpin subplot is actually more inteersting than the Daredevil/Matt Murdock exposed story.  But the Kingpin story works because of the Matt Murdock exposed story.  It is a nice compliment.<br />As is a tradition in the Marvel Universe, there are cameo appearances from other Marvel Universe characters; Spiderman, Electra, and the Black Widow all appear, but they hinder this story and bog it down.  The appearance of the Kingpin's wife Vanessa, however, gives this story an interesting subplot and lift.  She is a character rarely used and Bendis does use her hear brilliantly.<br />The artwork is of a film noir style and works very well.  The story does slow down in some areas and the cameos didn't help; but, overall - this is another great Daredevil adventure.	2003-08-11

Contrary to some of the negative reviews who assert that McWhorter's book is anecdotal, they have mislead possible buyers.  Yes, there are a lot of anecdotes from his expierence as a college professor and as a black man growing up in America.  However, he also asserts (implicitly so) that anecdots are a way to measure if something may have a ring of truth to it (like personal accounts of racism, which are largely anecdotal).<br />In the interests of being fair, it should be noted that McWhoter does cite many studies in his book ranging from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Newsweek, and the Sourcebook of Criminal Statistics.  I can only assume that negative reviewers are so cuaght up in ideaology, that they want to focues on the easists things to refute.  Anecdotal evidence are always great straw men because they are limited and subjective.  Although, it is fair to suggests that McWhoter does make some inductive fallacies because his expierences are not universially positive (i.e., he dos not have infinite knowledge), I assert that he is not trying to make such a claim, but instead is using his expierences to generalize the problems that are already cited in previous studies that are well researched.<br />What is his claim? That there is, in general, a 'cult of victimology' that is prevelent among American Black communities that strecthes along poor, middle class, and wealthy of African-Americans.  He, for the most part, logically lays a case, based on studies, anecdotes, and history, that black communities are caught in a victimology mind-set that leads to other social problems like a separtists and anti-intellectual attitude.<br />I did take some issues with certian statements and in particular, quickly inserted statements, used as analogies that are still open to debate.  However, they do not directly influence his thesis (after all, his analogies do not support the opposite view, just that in one case I can remember the matter is not settle).<br />Finally, McWhoter's book is completely engrossing.  Though the book is 250+ pages, it reads quickly and very well.  He is masterful in his use of the language.  I think it is insightful, that McWhorter comes from a moderate position.  He avoids the demagogue pronouncements used by the left and the right.  He is just trying to tell the truth from analysis.  He at times takes issues with the consrevatives as well as the liberals.  The difference, after reviewing Amazon reviews, it appears the conservatives are at least willing to listen.logies do not support the opposite view, just that in one case I can remember the matter is not settle).  <br />Finally, McWhoter's book is completely engrossing.

While much of this material, if read alone, may be over the head of most young people, I used the chapter titles and articles to involve discussion.  Further, it helped them 'think beyond their years.'<br />Each essay does stand on its own, but equally, they complete the picture when the book is completely fimsihed.  The wonderful thing about Orthodoxy is that it has, and always will be, religion devoted to the entire person and these chapters bare this out.  Ideas such as art, bioethics, and bereavement (just to name a few) are all discussed in the normal uncompromising, yet patoral approach which Orthodoxy is known for among Orthodox.  This is also a great book to introduce others to, not so much what we believe, but how we view certian impacting issues.	2003-08-11

In \\"The Jesus I Never Knew\\" Yancey does a great job in putting Christ in a 'modern' context so our today's reader can relationally understand and 'feel' Jesus.<br />Yancey tries to remove the Jesus many of us grew up with:  The \\"lifeless flannelboard' Jesus we observed as children in Sunday school (p. 85)  His book is a challenege to Christian liberals who tend to view Jesus only as a social and political revolutionary and it is a challenge to many Evangelicals and all fundamentalists who tend view 'Chrsitological' doctrine in a cultural, and often American vacumm (Yancey's use of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy is very telling in his ability to draw from Eastern Chrsitians and make their life's revelat to Western Readers).<br />One recent reviewer suggests this book is somewhat shallow, and sugests reading Marcus Borg's \\"Meeting Jesus Agian for the First Time.\\"  First, this book, though maybe not theologically extensive as other books, it does do what the author intended, to show Jesus for who he is, man and God.  I have a couple of places where I question Yancey's statements, but overall he has done a great job for presenting an authentic Christ.  Yancey is primarily a journalists telling the message and is probably more effective than most theologians and is much more so than Borg.  Secondly, Borg's book is even more shallow and less meaningful. Further, Borg cannot allow his naturalistic worldview to alow for a high Christology.  Borg's Jesus looks very much like Borg.  Yancey's view of Jesus is much closer to the truth.  A great alternative to both these books is 'Living Jesus' by Luke T. Johnson.	2003-08-02

Although their expierence and 1st person perspective is not the view of all our kids, it is undeniably the view from many of the Western World's youth.<br />The first half of the book gets right to the heart of the matter, by showing in language their audience  (teens and young adults)can understand about the war that is presently being waged because of the ideas of a postmodern soceity which has sprung forth from the ideas of nihilism and how this doctrine contnually finds its way in the homes of different gereations (Rome, Nietzsche, and 60's drug culture).<br />They do not try and convine the reader through an apologetic work that their position is true, instead, they are asserting it as a self-evident fact, and spend a little time tracing its possible orgins.  Their bigger concern, and for the intended audience they are on target, is to offer the truth to hurting people;  that Christ is our resurrection and hope and to give meaning in a seemingly meaningless world.<br />The strength of the section is that they beautifully offer in a few pages the truth and hope of Christ with passion and strength.  The second half of the book focuses on many Saints and modern Christians of the church offer the youth (and examples for purposefull living and, strength, and hope in Christ.

Though some reviewers have critized the text about Clark's understanding of Protestantism and the Southern Baptists Convention (SBC) in particular, they have not addressed the schisms in the Baptist faith (and Protestantism) nor have they been fair to Clark's text. The groups who have left Orthodoxy are much diferrent in dynamics than the splits in Protestantism (for one, when one leaves Orthodoxy, they are no longer Orthodox; but a schismatic Protestant is still a Protestant and is the logical outworking of Protestent doctrine).<br />As a former Baptist, I found nothing in error with Clark's review of the SBC. His review on other issues like 'sola scriptura' and 'tradition' are above average chapters, however, his refutation of 'sola' proof texts used by Evangelicals is average and I wish more detialed analysis on the texts were used. The chapter is only 15 pages and many texts have been dealt with more througohly by some of the Catholic Apologists. I assert he goes on a red herring in saying that Paul was only asserting the Old Testament when writing about the sufficiency of scripture- yes, that is a given, but the New Testament is still inspired scripture and when he finaly deals with this, his conclusion (which I agree with) is not as forceful as it should be.<br />I wanted to give this book a higher approval rating because I essentially agree with him on almost all points, but the book is too small and many other essenial tenets of Orthodoxy are either not discussed or barely touched such as Theosis. This book is probably very good for someone who is just being introduced to Orthodoxy and is him or herself at wits end with the heresies and schisms of Protestantism. For the seasoned reader looking for an apologitic to aid in articulating the faith, there is much better material elsewhere.	2003-07-18

The book's strength is that it is concise while not sacraficing scriptural analysis and well layed out arguemnts for the truth of the Christian doctrines presented in this text.<br />Of course, because Martin was a controversial and colorful personality, many may dismiss this book entirely, but most evangelicals will agree with this text.  It is important to note, that though this book is not entirely in line with an Orthodox or Catholic perspective, many Christians from these branches (for lack of a better word) will learn from this book as well.

Thee are four chapters and within 200 pages, Sowell does what most authors do not - scholarly, yet succintly, refute the positions of liberal social groups bent on placing their vision on American society and eslewhere.<br />In the chapters, \\"The Quest for Cosmic Justice\\"  and \\"The Mirage of Equality\\" he analyzes the liberal quests to redistrubute laws, income, etc to bring about a social policy that aids the so-called less prosper by violating the liberties of the wealthy.  In fact, he demonstrates the fallacy of such notions and policies as well as their utter failures.<br />His third chapter, \\"The Tyranny of Vision\\" is in my view his best section of the book and warrants five stars in and of itself.  He uses many of the pre-WW II pacifists arguments and shows where they failed then and contniue to fail now.  He exposes the egoists claims for peace by liberals and how they often lead to more damage as evil enemies will use the weakness of pacifists to inflict more harm on the internal commuinity (not to mention their own people).<br />The last chapter is written well also, where he succesfully discusses the rule of law as it is superior than the search for cosmic justice as determined by a few.  This book is a must read as it will help conservatiives better articulate the values they hold on to, the moderates understand the truth of  of the left's extremem and illogical positions, and  if a liberal reads this book, hopefully they'll comprehend why their quest is misguided and one could even argue - evil.	2003-06-28

But it should had been a little better developed and bigger, citing more examples (or exploring the examples already presented even deeper), antedotes and history.  With the negatives aside, this book still warrants four stars as Father Greeley's talent for writing to a variety of reading levels in one text is outstanding.  Whether one reads more academic works or populists books, this book is sure to be a pleasure to read for most.<br />Greeley's psoition is to write a book to show the differnce between the Catholic imagination juxtaposed against a Protestant imagination in American society in particular.  In expressing this difference, the first three chapters exceed in engaging the reader.  The fisrt chapter, &quot;Sacred Place, Sacred Time&quot;  deals primarily with the Catholic tradition and religious imagery and I think there is a strong difference between the two traditions.  As the Protetsant tradition moves further West  (I  mean West in the abstract), the churches become increasingly more plain and look more often than not as small civic centers, while the Catholic Church, still builds beautiful places of worship, whether the facilities are in an older gothic or contempary style.<br />The second chapter titled &quot;Sacred Desire&quot; is beautiful.  Most of the other chapters are still engaging, but a little less so.  The saddest thing is that I think many, if not most American Catholics have lost this imagination.  My assertions are mostly from my limiited expierence with Catholics, but besides the strength of family and community, many of the ideas presented in this book do not seem to touch the homes of many American Catholics.  This is why, the book should be developed even more and maybe taught to Catholics, because I tthink that Catholics can learn from the book as much as Protestants.	2003-06-21

In my serach about the Orthodox faith, I found after reading this book I was indeed searching for teh Orthodox faith.  This book was a good influence in my conversion, because Clendenin, a Protetstant - the tradition I was currently in - wrote such a objective and endorsing work, I found it hard to not go to the Orthodox Church and expierence it for myself.<br />Compared to most Portestants who examine the Orthodox faith, Clendenin seems to &quot;get it.&quot;  He is respectful, if not appreciative of the Orthodox liturgical expierence.He is aptly able to inform others on how the Orthodox Church  understands  scripture and tradition as the &quot;witness of teh Spirit.&quot;  His chapter on theosis is very good and his last chapter tries to evaluate the Orthodox perspective.<br />Like another reviewer, I ended up converting to the faith a few months later.

She chronicles the assault as the left manipulates the media, higher and elementry education, the justice system and much more.<br />She sets a backdrop for moral standards by quickly  (a little to quickly) reviewing the Cardinal virtues and largely relying on the great C.S. Lewis' descriptions of these virtues.  She, throughout her book writes a lot on humanity and that those who may disagree with others, can -should, still be concerned for their political/social opponents  and not wish ill will on anyone: something she says she noticed a lot from the Left - including once, herself.  She is open and candid - something often missing from the left and the right.<br />This book works very well on a populist level because her arguments are made by using the reality of outragous prima facia evidence that &quot;something is rotten in the state&quot; of the US.  Her examples are alarming.  However, she rarely uses logical arguments and therefore the reader is left with a lot of examples with what is wrong, but not of a way to articulate why it is wrong.  She possibly should have used more material work by C.S. Lewis called &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot; (since she was already refrencing Lewis anyway).<br />For a popular, yet logical/apologetic book on moral relativism, read &quot;Relativism:  &quot;Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air&quot; by Frank Beckwith and Greg Koukl and/or &quot;C.S. Lewis for teh Third Millennium&quot; by Peter Kreeft.<br />Lastly, Bruce is an extremely talented writer.  I find her two books to be more engrossing than most contempary social critics and would have given this book 5 stars, but the lack of teaching the reader logical argumentation and not quite developing &quot;The Cardinal Virtues&quot; leaves this book at 4 stars.  She is a talented writer who I hope writes many more books to come - entertaining and thought provoking.4 stars.

Gresham Machen and the Crisis of Conservative Protestantism in Modern America	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Hart Writes an Insightful Look at Machen and His Time	D.G. Hart's book &quot;Defending the Faith&quot; is an extraordinary biogarphy.  He uses Machen as a backdrop to tell of the encroachment of Christian and secular liberalism in the firsat hald  of the 19th Century.<br />Unlike most biogarphies, that are often dry and standard on how they present the information, Hart is keen enough to mix Machen's life, letters, thoughts, and the controversies of the day together - and does this without loosing the reader.<br />Machen is seen as a human being with strong suits and faults.  We discover also that some secualr liberals join Machen in his attack on Christian liberals.  Machen was a prolific schoalar  (though I do not agree with many of his views) and one feels they are watching the battle live as he fights against a liberal Protestant Christianity, especially in the Presbyterian Church.	2003-05-13

She takes the reader into some of the liberal strongholds such as NOW and the democratic party.<br />Tammy Bruce is not so much concerned with attacking the liberal position, for she is in many cases, very liberal herself, but she is fighting against the leftist groups who scew the issues and demonize anyone and all groups who oppose their highlighted topics such as abortion and gay-rights, even if it means opposing some individuals who are for other real life issues in which they  (left) are for.<br />She detials this in the \\"OJ Simpson trial\\" and the aftermath where she found many conservatives were more concerned with \\"women rights\\" than many liberals.

Far be it - he does take the Church to task for some of the way they have handled certian things like the Child sex abuse scandel.<br />With that said, he defends the Church from silly and often agenda type attacks where individuals and groups opposed to the Church distort much of current events and reconstruct history to fit in with their agenda.  He calls to task the illogical and disingenious assertions thrown by those people concerned only with their agenda.<br />Topics discussed are: Feminizism, gay-rights, and the new media, just to name a few.  The one real fault in this book is probably that it is too short for such a polemic topic.  In order to probably please his editors, this book is only about 216 reading pages.  However, it is exhaustively researched so one can go to primary source documents for themselves if needed.<br />Oh, by the way, Jenkins is not Catholic and neither am I, just in case someone thinks his book or my review is denominationally swayed.	2003-05-12

A Journey in Karate	Rarely in the martial arts world are biographies rich with insight about both the individual and the training.  Normally, -except a couple bio accounts of Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris' auto-bio account- the books are very dry and not very telling. Sometimes it is the writing and often it is because the reader is never really let under the skin of the martial artist.  In this book - that has changed.<br /><br />Ninomiya graciously allows the reader to travel in his mind and spirit as he grows from an unfocused (though hardworking)martial artist and somewhat immature teen into a higly skilled and mature warrior.<br /><br />The reader travels and sees when Ninomiya, through several events and a couple of key mentors, understands himself and his journey through karate.  Unlike most auto-biographical accounts, I never felt Ninomiya was boasting about his success.  Instead, he shows where his failures and determined manner leads to success beyond winning a \\"trophy.\\"<br /><br />An excellent book.  I learned much from this extra-ordinary man.	2003-04-27

One can get this book, practice the techniques, and have a pretty good idea on the submission wrestling sport.  Of course, there are many disadvantages from not taking formal lessons, but this book tries and narrows those gaps.<br />The strengths of this text are the easy to understand instructions and prior advice on safety and equipment.

Listen to his advice and learn, grow, and be a better wrestler!<br />The photos are nicely done and, like the written material, easy to mimic and therefore, learn from.  Some of the movements are better suited for sport and some are better used for self-defense, and not explaining these differences are probably the book's only weakness; however, this great text still deserves 5 stars.

This is an example of such an outcome for if one was to compare this story to the graphic novel \\"The Chalice\\", two very different Batmen emerge.<br /><br />I am going to avoid recapping the story, because it is so thin and easily discernable, that any hint would leave a possible reader disinterested from the beginning.  After all, some other readers may like this slow moving, illogical story.<br /><br />The major problems in this book are that Batman is a little slow on the up-take in trying to catch a killer who killed some of his employees ten years before.  Obvious clues (what little the authors developed) are seemly dismissed.  Further, the idea of logic is mentioned several times, just so many illogical conclusions are drawn.  Though I think the writers were trying to develop an existential search in Batman, they largely failed.  The tension just isn't there.<br /><br />The last great Batman graphic novels (not counting re-prints such as Dark Victory, etc) are from the period (1986-1992) which produced such great work as , \\"Year One\\", The Dark Knight Returns\\", \\"The Killing Joke\\", \\"Night Cries\\", \\"The Birth of the Demon\\", \\"Arkum Asylum\\", and \\"Digital Justice.\\", etc.  Since that time, the monthly magazines have produced the biggest \\"hits\\" and some of their reprints have been re-introduced into prestige hardbound formats.	2003-03-22

Essentially, Fr. Rausch's book tries to find a common ground to unite conservative and liberal Catholics as the Church moves forward in the modern world. While nicely written and easy to read, Fr. Rausch more often than not tends to side with the liberal side (though I think he understands himself as a moderate).<br />In so doing, he tends to use deconstructionists re-interpretations of many scriptural texts (something he caustions the liberal about doing) on subjects such as homosexuality. He is much faster, in my opinion to critizes the conservatives than the liberals in this position as he asserts many of the modern pyschological positions taught in the liberal colleges. This deconstruction is the problem many conservative Catholics have with the American Catholic Church.<br />While he is early in the book harsh on the post Vatican II failure in teaching young Catholics the essentials of the faith, he doesn't develop this much further and largely devotes an un-balanced amount of effort on the neo-conservatives.<br />The book is only 120 so pages and is cleverly written. I think Fr Rausch is trying to find a unity for his church that is very fragmented in North America. The book fails, however, because it often relies (like in the case of homosexuality) to rely on theories that are specualtive at best. Although he is hard on liberal Catholic scholars who seek to complety modernize or feminize the faith, he has develoed a work that is ultimately imbalanced in its presentation. The book should have been another 100 pages or so with more exaimation on the liturgy, liberal movements, and sexual morality.	2003-03-17

Moreland's book is an outstanding work.  While so many Christian books today  (especially in the Protestant world) are filled with fluff, Moreland presents a a text that puts an emphasis on the mind and its role in the Christian life.<br />The book has four parts with several chapters in each part: (1) Why the Mind Matters in Christianity, (2) How to Develop a Mature Chrsitian Mind, (3)What a Mature Christian Mind Looks Like, (4) Guaranteeing a Future for the Christian Mind.<br />Moreland's writing is concise, yet very thorough.

A recent detractor to this book has not really made an argument against Trifkovic's thesis, but instead has made dispareging statements.  There are some problems with the book, but one needs to make an honest attempt to deal with his position.<br />The book has many strengths and many weaknesses (many mechanical/grammatical mistakes that demonstartes a rush to print by the editors).  Serge's historical treatment  of the growth of Islam is not politically correct, but does attack the more brutal truths about the foundation of Islam, with that said, he sometimes speaks where there is no evidence.<br />The book is at its best when discussing historical facts about Islam and Muhammad and the theological-philosphical problems with Islam, of which there are many.  The weakness of the texts is when Serge tries to attach his speculation as to the motivation of many of  Muhammad's actions.  Thougth I at times agree, it is only specualtive and often, Serge reports it as fact.<br />This book is a good primer from a Christian perspective for those who have not studied Islam, but there are better books on the market like Giesler's \\"Answering Islam.\\"  Also, a warning should be stated, that though this book is historically accurate, there are many Muslims who have spiritualized Islam  (Serge would say these Muslims, though noble, are not logically following Islam)and have contributed much to society.  All in all I agree, but there are just too many nagging minor errors - hence three stars.	2003-02-17

The book's orinigal title, &quot;School of Prayer&quot; is more appropiate because this book should be utilized by all Christians.<br />In the last few years, a resurgence of prayer books liek the &quot;Prayer of Jabex&quot; by Wilkinson and &quot;Prayer of Jesus&quot; and &quot;The Covering&quot; by Hannagraff are selling of the charts, this book by Bloom is far more superior than their text.  Though only about 144 pages, there is much wisdom and the book should be read slowly after much spiritual contemplation.<br />It is easy to read, yet it contains so much theological depth that it is truly amazing.  The first 20 pages are average as it has an interview with Bloom.  The real meat begins in chapter one title &quot;The Absence of God&quot; where Bloom writes, &quot;If you look at the relationship  (us and God) in terms of mutual relationship, you would see that God could complain about us a great deal more thann we about Him.  We complain that He does make Himself present to us for a few minutes we reserve for Him, but what about the twenty-three and half hours during which God may be knocking at our door and we answer 'I am busy...&quot;<br />This is just a taste - buy the book for a deep look at prayer.

Franz is privy to a lot of detialed information and as such this book as many photostat copies of offical memo's and writings.<br />I imagine that his decsion to leave the denomination must have been extremely painful, for he gave over 60 years of his life to this religion.  At times one feels sympathy for all Witnesses, for the vast majority are very sincere people who give much of their time for their religion.  The pressure put on them to &quot;pioneer&quot;  (witnessing) and follow the doctrines of the church is more cohersive than anything else.<br />Franz does a commendable job in this book and it is well worth the read.	2002-10-06

Nicholi, Jr's book is a brillant look into the ideas and life of two modern icons, Sigmund Freud and C.S. Lewis.  Like the title suggests, the author compares the  views and lives of these two men who have, in their own way, contriuted greatly to some of the most common and perplexing issues of all time.<br />Nicholi takes great pains to remain objective as possible, while admitting his bias.  His objectivity is largely intact as he accurately relates the theories and ideas of each person.  One should not msitake his form of objectivity for impartiality, a claim he does not make.<br />This book is very engrossing and reads very easily.  The strength of his book is that the author explores how one views the world in relation to how one lives in the world.  The author aviods broad brushing statements because he is largely focusing on these two men and not inducing that everyone falls into these catagories, however, as a guide, he does suggest that normally thier is a relation between ones beliefs and life.  This is a prima facia position because it stands to reason taht ones views would effect ones practices.<br />Chapters on hap[piness, sex, love and death are completely engrossing and the book picks up the pace as it towards the end.  Further, in the last segenmnets as we read about the last days of Freud and Lewis, we feel for both characters, but we do so differently.  Both have greatly influnced their field of study.  Both reached beyound the cirles of their fields to have a great impact on other fields of study, and both discussed many of the same topics at length; i.e., sex, love, and death.<br />In the end, however, one feels compassion for Freud and Lewis, but for Freud, the compassion is felt as loss for a man who left this world in a state of exestential agnst and for Lewis, the sense of loss is selfish, for we want more thoughts and ideas from him.  But our compassion reminds the same, for his barriers for love were only opended towards the last years of his life.<br />In the end, one found \\"joy\\" and purpose (Lewis), and the other pain and anguish (Freud).  Both insightfully shared their lives with us.only opended towards the last years of his life.<br />In the end, one found \\"joy\\" and purpose (Lewis), and the other pain and anguish (Freud).

He further states his biase that he finds the &quot;modernists and postmodernists&quot; world equaly dangerous.  Guinness strageticaly starts chapter one by discussing a professor's observations on recent classroom discussions involving the story &quot;The Lottery.&quot;  In short, twenty years ago people were replused by the ending, now students did not find the ending  (the sacrifce of someone by the community) all that troubling.<br />He further analyzes the new art of &quot;spin&quot;, especially in the politcal circles and the lack of truth or its necessity.  He quickly discusses Darwin, Nietzsche, and Marx then goes on to make a case on their effect in developing a postmodern culture.<br />The book does have some weaknesses, however; including broad-brushing statements because it is so short.  I know the authors intent was to write a primer and therefore a short text, but it  is still somewhat of a laibility.  One, I think he was willing to take.  Because it is a short text, this book is very, very easy to understand  (disregard the reviewer who had troubles with this book, it is extermely easy to understand).

Wright, formerly of Oxford University and Marcus Borg of Oregon University enter into a very thoughtful discussion on Jesus Christ.  This book is special for several reasons.  One of the most important is that, unlike other religious topical books where one author takes another shot at the other author; both men stay above-board, focusing their thoughts on the discussion at hand.  It is an academic work written for the layman without sacraficing academic intergrity.<br />Secondly, both men approach the subject with reverance.  Areas of discussion in this book range from a historical, sociological, and theological lens. Both men discuss Jesus divinty, his resurrection, and the nature of what it means to be a Christian.<br />I have rarely ever agreed with Borg, but have always admired his approach to the dialogue.  Unlike other liberal Jesus Seminar individuals, he takes great care to outline his views without being condensending.<br />N.T. Wright presents a more traditional Christianity, and in the end- history, source documents, and logical arguments work in his favor.  This book, however, is not so much a debate, but a discussion.  This adds to the books flavor.  When people are not trying to \\"score points\\" but instead deal with the topic, more depth into the discussion is gained.<br />An outstanding work.	2002-08-19

In particular, they bring back the yellow union suit and retell they story on how Daredevil went from Yellow to all red.<br />The book is a retelling because the authors do not go back to Matt Murdock's (Daredevil) childhood like Frank Miller did in his 1993 epic \\"The Man Withot Fear.\\"  The story gives enough background for a newcomer can follow the story.  The authors intent seems to be to deal with the entire Karen Page episode and the values of doing the right thing that his father instilled in him.<br />The dialogue and artwork are great and the story moves quickly and enjoyably. This story deals with Daredevil coming to terms in regards to Karen's death and he travels back to the time he met her.  I do prefer Miller's origins story.  It is slower, more detialed, and much more psychological, but this does not in anyway should take away from Loeb and Sale's book.<br />A fun book and a must for us Daredevil fans.	2002-07-18

This series first appeared in the magazine format and because of its popularity was put into a graphic novel trade paperback.<br />Kevin Smith exceels as the author.  I have not liked any of his movies, and was very skeptical about his outing as a Daredevil author.  I was pleasently surprised.  The story is complex, yet, he is able to explain everything that is happenning in its proper place.  We have to travel along this mystery with Daredevil.  Also, Smith handels the spiritual struggel of Daredevil very well.  He takes Frank Miller's character sketch of Daredevil and stays true to the person while still making the story interesting and refreshing.<br />The artwork is spectacular.  Because of the story, it could have been easy for the artists to try and stretch the boundaries of the Daredevil artistic flavor which would have been an instant noval attraction, but ultimately a long term anomoly that does not serve the comic palet.<br />This is one of the better comic stories to touch Marvel's shores in some time.  DC seems to rule the grahic novel format. This one rivals most of DCs top hitters.  Kevin Smith should keep writing for comics because there are few who can write in this genre at this level.	2002-05-17

This book strengths lie in that Johnson, a first rate scholar, explains why the quest for a historical Jesus often fails.<br />The book introduces the Jesus Seminar and some of their most popular teachers and scholars.  One reviewer clamims that Johnson is Polemic, but I am curious what he considers polemic.  Johnson is not polemic, but honest in his assesments of this group.  He informs the reader which Seminar folk are actual scholars and which ones are not.<br />Johnson then reminds the reader the &quot;limitations of history&quot; in trying to develop a historical Jesus.  This area examines the limtations of this social science.  He then develops what is &quot;historical about Jesus&quot; and the &quot;Real Jesus.&quot;  This book is an easy read, yet has enough depth that it adequately deals with such an important topic.  While I cannot completely agree with Johnson on every detail, he has produced a great work which is neeeded as a counter-balance to the media circus that surrounds the Jesus Seminar and the often lack of serious scholastic response by &quot;litarlist Bible Christians.&quot;	2002-04-08

Having taught Police Defensive Tactics, I can say that he covers unarmed defense against weapons in a very thorough manner.<br />The weakness is that he starts with complex items and it is at the end that some of the basic techniques are shown at the very end of the book.  It should have been reversed and this incoherenec is a little troubling.

The title &quot;Incarnate Love&quot; truly sets the standard for ethics.  While Western Christianity has relied on arguments for &quot;right ethics&quot; since the scholastic period, Orthodoxy relies more on the Christological ethic.  Members learn this ethic with a proper worship as expierenced in the Divine Liturgy.<br />One learns right behavior by worshipping Jesus the Christ, who was incarnate love for all humankind.  This book is a sharp contrast to what most westerners read on ethical discussions.  He addresses the real problem in ethics, especially among Christians instead of focusing on the subsets of those problems.<br />This book is very insightful, and should be mandatory in any Christian ethics course.	2002-02-17

While this book has many of the recurring fantasy themes found else where, the contributors to this graphic novel have produced a fun, can't-put-it down comic.<br />The story centers around the person Robin Drake as he journeys to warn the other inhabits on &quot;earth&quot; of the return of the Beast, a villian the others thought had died fifteen years ago.  Many of the superheros are cleverly introduced and united under the banner of saving the &quot;world.&quot;  Some heros take more proding than others, which aids in the story telling.  It was interesting using Robin as the central character - considering he has always been a sidekick  (even on his own, Nightwing has never really broken out of Batman's shadow).<br />This move gives the story more force and gives a &quot;Frodo&quot; of the Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy feel to the book, without copying the material too much.  The formula also works well, so why change a genre that works so well - an unlikely hero, who saves the world.<br />The art is outstanding and many great artist contribute their unquie talents to provide pertinent images as the story progresses.  A must for graphiic novel fans, who just want to read a good story, view some great art, and have a nice evening.	2002-02-16

The target this time are &quot;cops&quot; and many &quot;cops&quot; only mildly remembered in previous Batman stories are quickly brought into this story only to be killed.<br />The plot thickens as Gordon and Batman try and get the killer.  The art work is much better than the Long Halloween.  It has a similar style, but is perfected in this series, especially on the Batman.  The story is thinner and I easliy figured out the killer after the first death.  Neverless, the story is still written so well, I stayed tuned and felt compelled to go on.  Enjoying every minute as I turned each page.  Robin is skillfully brought in to the story.<br />Even if you have the magizine format, get this special hardbound edition.  You can re-read the story withhout touching the magazine (therefore, not having to take a chance of devaluing the comic)and enjoy the read.	2001-12-22

The book works on two levels: (1) it works at by providing an earnest account of their journey. I say their journey because although it is written by Father Peter Gillquist and he is the person narrating the story, he tries and focus his account with others in the group. So it is a personal account while at the same time, tellling the story of the new founded denomination Evangelical Orthodox Church, which later converted to the Eastern Orthodox Church.<br />(2), He deals with certian objections he anticipates from the readers such as Traditions and Mary. He does this effectively, however, it is done in a simple way as not to turn the book into an academic theological discourse. This works well for beginners into the subject. It may not satisfy all however, and sometimes he does not &quot;close the case&quot; well enough to persuade even thoughs who might agree with him.<br />He could have dealt with historical material with a little more depth and still kept the pace of the book quick and intersting. Over all, still a good read. For a conversion story it is less polemic than Frank Schaeffer's book &quot;Dancing Alone&quot; and therefore an easier read, however, he presents a less convincing case for Orthodoxy than Schaeffer.	2001-12-18

Now, I'm not really a fan of American point karate scene, but still found this text interesting about the ins-and- outs of the tournament process and how one can prepare themselves for success in this endeaver.<br />Though I'm not currently teaching and was never a hugh fan of the point system (I prefer full-contact), I did in my youth and sometimes as an adult compete for fun and comraderie.  Since this was not my forte, but I thought it was important for my students to compete just for the fun, I picked up this book in 1991.<br />She does a good job in interpreting and commuticating some of Bruce Lee's fighting principles and she gives good ideas about some ring saviness.  Though I knew the ideas about fighting, she put them in a very articulate way and so I would recommend this book to my students who really wanted to enter into the field of &quot;sport karate.&quot;<br />She covers fighting, katas, and tournament structure.  To those individuals who really want to pursue the sport point system and cometition kata arena, this book will be very helpful.  For those of us more into full-contact, if nothing else, it may still be an interesting read.	2001-11-30

This book takes the generally accepted chronilogical format in detailing Bruce's life and death.  It provides enough information on his life and death without resorting to too many rumors.  Although it sticks to the facts, it is not boring.<br />It tells the story of his martial learnings and romance with Linda Lee without becoming vouyeristic.  It strikes the right amount of balance of what a &quot;fan&quot; should know.  This may be due to the time it was written, so shortly after his death that many things were not yet known or for the simple fact that these writers had some integrity and avoided endless silly sketches on his life.<br />The book is also an easy read  (I have had this book since 9).  The photos are now old, but are mixed well in the book and a few I have not seen in other materials.  This is a classic text, and a must for Bruce Lee fans.	2001-11-25

The book works on several fronts.<br />One, the text works well for laity who have little academic training, but want a truly deeply provoking book on the sacramental and liturgictal life of the Church.  Secondly, it is written well enough for academics to read and pondure insightful scholarship on doctrines such as the Eucharist and its revelance when looking at the creation, man's present condition, and the Kingdom of God.  Further, it gives a perspective not often read about in Western Protestant circles and brings historical tecahings into a mystical, yet, understandable (though not completely comprehendable) way.

This book, a compolation of his essays and speeches, is a well written book, but ultimatley fails in the area it tries to most assert itself - logic.<br />He often makes many fallacies like asserting &quot;universial negatives&quot; where he broad brushes Christianity without having full knowledge about Chritianity or Christians.  His distates for this religion interferes with clear thinking.  He distorts the movement to provide strength for his arguments.<br />For example, he claims on page 27, &quot; Christians, however, object to the disseination of knowledge of this fact (sex education), since they hold it good that sinners should be punished.&quot; Of course, he may find Christians who holdthis view, put it is a universial negative-he has no way of knowing if all of them hold this view.  Ssecondly, most Christians, according to the teachins of traditional Christianity, see themselves as sinners.  Is he saying they (Christians) want to be punished?<br />When he writes that religion is based on fear, and partly on the unknown, he negates the same principle response that atheism is based because people wish to live a life without a god so they may enjoy their proclivities.  In &quot;How the Churches Have Retarded Progress&quot; Russell chooses as an example without seriously dealing with the subject  (3 paragraphs on this subject).When he says the Church has inflicted underserved suffering on people, I wonder if he is speaking about all the hospitals, colleges, and charities ran by Christian churches through-out the world.  The logical outworkings of Christ's teachings have only helped society.<br />There is so much more to be said, but space limits us here.  I plead that those who are agnostic or atheist at leasts read this book with clear logical thinking - more than likely, like many, regardless of their beliefs, they will read him and accept his rantings as excuses to hold to their anti-religious views.accept his rantings as excuses to hold to their anti-religious views.	2001-11-17

He has many good chapters and commentary that deals with &quot;hard work&quot;, media political wants, and hot button issues.<br />This book is not long and therefore, only can delve into a subject at its surface level.  This may be a strength, as our fast paced nation prefers quick information.  Hopefully, people would be inspired to read more on important subjects.<br />Matthews' insights on George W. Bush, Al Gore, and Bill Clinton are especially interesting, considering he favors Bush and he is a lifelong Democrate.  His insight on politcal language is something I have noticed for somethime and he brings this out nicely by using the topic of abortion as backdrop  (his point is abortion and language).  I disagree with his final conculsion on how to solve the problem, but it is nonetheless, interesting.<br />A good book.  It can be read in one afternoon and the information is easy to digest.

This book, written as a extention to his popular &quot;Why Christianity Must Change or Die&quot; is much of the same while trying to explain why Theism is dead and why Christianity must change to engage the world.<br />First, let me deal with the outright dishonest tactics laid in this text.  Spong should be ashamed because these things are self-evident for a Christian teacher.  In his introduction, he tries to string such giants in the 20th century together as beings his mentors, giving the appearance, that they, like him, believe the same thing.  He puts Karl Barth in the same breath as Paul Tiiich and Don Cupitt.  The problem is of course, Karl Barth is the opposite of Paul Tillich and asserted the theism of God to new levels-He was a neo-clavinists!  The dishonest tactics start from there and never stop.<br />His primary audience are those individuals who already accept his message  (he implicitly says so).  He distorts bibilcal passages like Joshua 10 by saying the theistic God could not be real because the passage says that he stopped the sun in the sky, as if the sun rotated around the earth.  All serious scholars agree that it is written in an anthropormorphic idom - how it was viewed from the people on the ground.  We, so-called much knowledgeable people do the same thing today:. Sunrise and sunset.  Every news cast terms it that way - as if the sun rises and sets.<br />Spong is upset with this theistic God who judges both  the quick and the dead.  He wants us to move beyound sin and guilt.  But why?  Should not people feel guilty about thier improper actions.  Does not evil exsist?  Pyschologists have a term for people who do not feel guilt -psychopath!  Prisons are full of them Bishop Spong.<br />Of course, churches are just trying to hold on to power.  Disregard all the hospitals and univeristies established by them or the soup kitchens and diasters relief organizations  (Red Cross was founded by Christains).<br />Also he does not argument against theism in a logical format, but instead in an existential format.  That is fine and has a place, but it does not make it correct or true.  Existentially, people can believe or want to believe anything.<br />Lastly, his position is old and has already failed  (he tries to make it sound new and untried).  It is call the Universialist Unitarian Church or possible even Unity Church of Christ.  Both places allow the calling of Jesus as Lord, if one desires, and does not accept a theistic being in the sky.  Therefore, Spong should just move to those denominations and pursue their causes instead of creating his own.  They essentially accept the same teachings.zations  (Red Cross was founded by Christains).<br />Also he does not argument against theism in a logical format, but instead in an existential format.

He touches on the major highlights without overburdening the laity or reader who many are probably reading about this subject for the first time.  After all, that seems to be the audience he is targeting.<br />The second part, on faith and worship, is concise and simple.  He throws in the major doctines of Orthodox beliefs in which they have in common with the rest of Christianity as well as some of the beliefs particular for this Eastern expression of the religion:i.e. essence and energies, apopthatic (negative theology), image and likeness.  Further, he shows that this is not a monolithic movement in areas such as what makes up the Church.<br />All the churches are mentioned and briefly discussed.  Many saints are also mentioned and one comes away with a great appreciation of this historic Body of Christ.	2001-09-04

I have given the book a favorable rating only because it is hard to discount someone's journey from one religious perspective to another.  They open up their heart's and struggles for all of us to see and in this the book works very well.<br /><br />We see the existential quest for Christian truth and unity and the tension posed by one family member changing  a Christian worldview while the other is resistant.  The tension is a compelling read.<br /><br />Where the book fails is that Scott Hahn does not really engage the theological debate.  He touches a little on the different perspective in understanding the Catholic idea of covenant compared to the Reformed perspective.  I think Hahn is on to something and to a very large part I agree with him, but he doesn't build a strong enough case.<br /><br />He also neglects that the \\"legal\\" idea of the covenant started during Catholic Scholasticism with Anselm's \\"Why God Became Man.\\"  The reformers built their systems largely on Anslem's premise  (probably one reason Anselm is still largely considered a great theologian in Reform circles).<br /><br />Further, Hahn brings up his search into Eastern Orthodoxy only to quickly dismiss after a page or so.  He does not analysis the Orthodox tradition fairly, instead, he brings up the dis-unity of \\"ethnic division.\\"<br /><br />All in all, I had difficulty reviewing this book.  So much is so good, after all, not many people open their struggles in a non-vouryeristic way; however, the arguments are not really presented for the superiority of the Catholic faith with in-depth care that it is needed.  Maybe, it was not his intent.	2001-09-01

Why the high rating?<br /><br />Well, first, Schaeffer does fail to chronicle a personal journey which a conversion title would suggest. But I think that he was not really trying to accomplish so much a chronicle log of event after personal event, but instead, deal with the issues he found as a crisis in Protestant and Catholic doctrines and views.<br />This he does exceptionaly well using, much like his father (the late Dr. Francis Schaeffer), a presupposational approach to the present conditions in our society. He critques protestantism the most out of the three branches of Christianity. To a large degree, his analysis is dead on.<br /><br />Schaeffer, however, fails in large with regards in the second half of the book when he deals with Orthodox doctrine. He still can't quit baggering Protetsant doctrine and this is a distractor. He should have presented the positive doctrine of Orthodoxy and lett it speak for itself. For a look at Orthodox basic beliefs, read \\"The Orthodox Way\\" by Bishop Ware.<br />The first half of the book is outstanding, the second half poorly presented. Four stars because the first half is that good.	2001-09-01

It was (I believe) his first book and some areas in the book are rough around the edges.  All in all, however, he does a fine job in connecting many ideas of the 1800's and early twentieth century and the moral collaspe they have caused in Western culture.<br />Ravi's strength and weakness in the book is his dealings with thoughts of Nietzsche.  The strength is in showing how Nietzche's ideals, on a popular level, influnced &quot;the death of God&quot; movement and the Holocaust.  The weakness is that other noted athiests could have been given more &quot;time.&quot;  This would have caused a bigger book, but the knowledge would aid Theists greatly.<br />Ravi does addreses existential subjects which is his forte and I do wish he had reminded the reader that an existential claim does not make a truth claim.  After that however, the book excells.  This review is to balance critquie of this book against other reviewers, some of whom have not read the text with &quot;open eyes&quot;; it must be noted that Ravi does deal with some of the top atheists.  Nietzche, Sarte and Bertrand Russell are classic atheists who have laid much of the ground work of modern &quot;secularists.&quot;<br />Ravi has a great command of these thinker's positions and ideals.  He effectively dismantles them.  Further, Marx's ideals are atheistic and the atrocities of Communism and Nazism are logical outworkings of atheism.  In Atheism, man is the measure of all things; it must be asked, &quot;what man?&quot;  Lastly, the reviewer below distorts much of Ravi's argument.  For example, Ravi does not claim Darwin was an atheist (p.33).  This is a book written in a popular laymen style and thus is much needed.	2001-07-21

Frank Miller, a man who revolutionized the comic industry, wrote this story  in Daredevil #226-232.<br />The story focuses, smartly, on what would happen if a superhero's arch-enemy discovered his true identity?  The answer, is a cat and mouse, mental torture game, as Kingpin tries to destroy Daredevil's will.  He takes almost everything, until Daredevil is &quot;Born Again&quot;(one of the chapter titles in this graphic novel).<br />The psychological and religious symbolism is obvious, yet, not preachy.  The comic is fun while still asking the meaningful questions about our hero, and if we read close enough, maybe these same questions are asked about us.  A must have for any comic collection!	2001-07-19

The text avoids sensationalism and sticks to investigative research and theories.  While he does at times rely too much on analogous data  (which can be fallacious), he neverless, does an outstanding job in building a case on why he thinks Christianity grew and ultimatley, became the dominant religion in Western Europe.<br />Further, this book can serve as a warning to Christians as well (though not the author's intention).  Stark gives a persuasive case that Christainity rose out of several factors.  Many of them down right Biblical.  Though martyrs were actually few, their strength in their beliefs inspired many on-lookers.  Their promotion of the status of women, care for the unborn and infants, and promotion of family aided this young sect to becoming a world religion.<br />Also, they aided the sick when pagans would flee from the plagues.  The idea of public service and a strongly developed doctrine further strengthened this new religion.  This is how God works, through people, and the early church is an example of that.  The modern decline of Christianity in Western Europe is because those same principles have been discarded.  A must read!	2001-07-01

So far I'm still wanting.<br />First, the title is a misnomer, since in the forward, Father Hopko, who endorses the book, also tells the reader that the book is an &quot;Orthodox Perspective&quot; not neccesaarily &quot;Orthodox Teaching.&quot; I'm not to sure what that is supposed to mean. The Orthodox Church does not agree with this escthalocial construct, but it is written with an Orthodox twist? It is not clear. Therefore, the book is purchased with a kind of false pretense. The title &quot;Orthodox Perspective&quot; gives the suspecting buyer the ideal he is reading &quot;Orthodox teaching.&quot;<br />While the author quotes several Saints of the Church, scripture, and teachers, he is sometimes dis-jointed in connecting the dots. He often quotes too much and fails in providing enough personnal commentary.<br />While I tend to agree with his position compared to the curent rage of Pre-tribulational theology, I do not find too much different from traditional Amillinialism. The twist comes here in this text with a focus on Eastern Christrianity. This is the books strength. The West has ofetn view the &quot;last days&quot; through an American eyes version. The middle East climatic battles are read on what is America's role. This book tends to demonstarte the Church's role as we are Christians first, and Nationalist second.<br />That is the books strength and for it allow this book should be read.	2001-06-23

Less known, but highly regarded martail artist are written about in this section.<br />The drawbacks are the books price (... is steep for a small book) and traditional karate is not represented.

Philosopher and Cultural Critic Peter Kreeft has written an outstanding book discussing virture in Western Culture.  He opens the book by asking &quot;Is Virtue Out of Date?&quot;.  This sets the tone as he spends the next couple of chapters on how Western Culture got to the point in the lack of virtue we now see before us.<br />The middle of his book discusses the &quot;Cardinal Virtues&quot; and &quot;Theological Virtues&quot; and their importance.  He then does a comparison and contrast between the &quot;Beatitudes&quot; and the &quot;Seven Deadley Sins.&quot;  His conculsion is a little too short for such a profound work, yet rating this important book four stars would not do it justice.

My wife received this book from her Sensei Matt Kaplan (When we lived in Hawaii), who was a student of Sensei Scaglione.  She brought it home, and myself being a Karate instructor, immeadiately read the text with interest and a critical eye.<br />This book is not a primer on technique, but instead, a primer on the mental aspects of the martial arts.  Often, comercial books are flooded with &quot;action&quot; photos, yet, neglecting the most important weapon and training tool - the mind.<br />This book is also very easy to read, yet, refreshing enough for more mature martial readers to enjoy.  The art work is simple and standard, but adequate enough for this excellent text.  A great book.	2001-06-13

Dr. Schreck has written a book that goes beyond the usual Catholic apologist rhetoric and simply explains his position without resulting to silly arguments and questenable tactics.<br />His writing style is easy and likeable.  He is not so bent on trying to prove, in my opinion, as much as he is trying to share the essence of Catholic beliefs to outsiders.  The book is probably, though not necessarily, directed to protestants.  I say this because he addresses many protetsant objections to Catholism, without seeking to enrage those on the other side.  It is a sharpe way of presenting one's faith, without causing more flame to the fire.<br />The book is not the most detialed or academic of its kind, but this again is a strength.  The layperson, who most needs to read and better understand the Catholic faith and practice, will find this book most appealling (at least I hope so).  I think this was the author's intent.  A great little book.	2001-06-01

This is the strength of the book, and in rating someone's work it must not be that I must always agree.  But that strength alone, can only nerit three stars.<br />He takes the reader from the first to the last chapter of the book of Revelation and this  carries the reader along and propbably will have much appeal.  He explains the pre-trib view very well.<br />Why only three stars?  First, he appeals to certian indivduals as scholars in this field of prophecy like Grant Jeffery, who is not a scholar in this area (just a popularizer) and it is poorly documented.  He is further to dogmatic on a subject that is open to much debate.  After all, this particular view is very recent in the history of Christianity (about 200 years).  Lastly, I think he and others in this camp are wrong and his arguments are much of the same pre-trib rhetoric often espoused by others, just not quite as boistrous.<br />It should be in most Christians household, wethered one believes this view or not, because it can be used as a reference; it is much better than other writers works on this view of end-times (except works of John MacArthur), and the format is easyly used as a quick reference.	2001-06-01

These techniques are more of an introduction to prepare the practitioner for the rest of the book.  It is filled with much information on distancing, takedowns and follow-ups, offensive and defensive strategies.<br /><br />The still photos give you a visual assessment of what is being discussed and drills you can use to train with. There is a short section on self-defense training and kata that is somewhat out of place; However, this book is so good compared to most martial arts instruction books, that these sections are easily overlooked.  The authors probably should devote another book to those topics, especially self-defense.<br /><br />A highly regarded text that every karateka who is serious about either sparring or \\"real\\" fighting should own.  The only other book comparable to this on the subject of sparring is \\"American Freestyle Karate\\" by Dan Anderson.	2001-05-31

Evert Koop have written a masterful book on the &quot;roberry of life&quot; in the world, and particularly, Western Culture.  Interestenly, this text, written over 20 years ago addresses the &quot;devaluation of human life&quot; and prophetically predicts the acceptance of redefining what it means to be a person and alive.<br />Ideas now coming to the forefront on news programs and the like, are already discussed here.  Items such as &quot;genetic&quot; knowledge and its impact on abortion and infanticide.  Further, Euthanasia is also discussed.<br />The last two chapters deals with &quot;The Basis For Human Dignity&quot; and what should be the response of the Christian.  The arguments are solid, yet, written in a style that lay-people can easily understand and follow.

Compiled stories of ex-protestants and their reasons for becoming orthodox.  All of the contributers write in a very easy to understand and likeable style.  All show great amounts of charity towards their evangelical brothers and sisters and believe God used those expierences to bring them up to orthodoxy.<br />So why the average rating?  Well, it is becuase, these contributers barely touch on doctrinal matters.  This not to say their reasons are not legitimate, but 18 different conversions stories all sounding pretty much the same, does get a little tiresome when presented in one book.  They speak about the liberal incroachment in protestantism (true), lack of unity (ture), and so forth;  however, they do not present much on the differences in apporaches in regards to doctrines, and therefore, much of the book feels incomplete.<br />Therefore, it is worth reading.  But I think a book with less contributers, but more in-depth expierences would have been much better. Still, a very easy read and likable read.	2001-05-26

Part 2 of the book, four other academics, two of which accept the resurrection and two of which do not, provide responses to the debate.  Part 3 has closing remarks by Ludemann and Craig.<br />In keeping this review to minimum, I want to address the apporaches by these two.  Craig engages the debate as a matter of history first, then faith next.  His asssertion, and very intelligently presented, demonstrates that using the criteria  most often used in oither historical documents of this genre, the ressurrection makes the most sense of what happened that Easter morning.<br />Ludemann asserts he is starting from a historical approach, but his &quot;historical&quot; approach asumes that the New Testamenmt has no historical witnesses (a matter debated among scholars), and he relies on the Q source, which is very problemmatic since there are no Q documents.  It is only a hypothetical document. Secondly, he sets up a straw man by saying &quot;All debates concerning the resurrection become involved with emotions.&quot;  This is, I assert, an intellectually dis-honest assessemnt.  While people have emotions on the issue, they can debate this subject from an academic understanding.  Further, he makes this claim against people who believe in the resurrection  but fails to say that those wo do not hold to it use emotions.  It must be a two way street.<br />The responses by the other authors are good.  But in this debate book, it is the debater, Craig and Ludemann, which takes center stage (as it should).  If you would like to read another debate that is similar to this one, get &quot;Will the Real Jesus Please Stand Up?&quot; involving Craig and Crossan.	2001-05-26

In this, the book does well, because it is so easy to understand.  His writing style is very conversational.  Yet, there is a lack of in-depth analysis and at times he overeaches in his assertions.<br />In example of this is when he writes about traditions, &quot;The tragedy of tradition is that it blinds people from seeing God.&quot; (p. 24).  This is overreaching since one, God determined set up many traditions and therefore, would be in some way at fault; and secondly, the blame is on people who misplaceses the focus on tradition on tradition itself and not on God.  Many Catholics (I'm not one) gain a rich, fresh relational expiernece with the living Christ through their traditions.<br />Similiarily, almost all Protestants have traditions.  Try changing the style of music in many churches and watch the uproar or consider the battle some churches have faced over such non-formal traditions as pews or chairs, choirs or contempory bands, and alter-calls.  I think Protestants must admit their traditions before engaging in dialouge on this point.<br />His strongest chapter is &quot;Is the Papacy taught in Scripture?&quot; and &quot;What About Mary?&quot;  These chapters are good introductions into these polemic issues, but one should study more in regards to these areas.<br />This book is probably best suited for someone who is new to the subject.  My advise would be to read more material after engaging this text.  This engagement should be from both sides of the ailse.	2001-05-20

This is due to the Western, compared to the Eastern approach in viewing Christianity.  While the west generally likes things in neat rational-concrete catagories, the east is generally able to except the mystery of God and focus their efforts in that area.<br />Bishop Kallistos Ware, a Protestant Convert to Orthodxy, has written this book in a very easy-to-read style.  He writes concisely (maybe at times to concise) which does not overburden the average Western reader.  I would have personnaly like a little more in-depth analysis in certain areas, but this was not his purpose.  It has caused me to study some ideas even more and I think that may have been the purpose.  To give a clear meaning aboutthis cherished religion, and for those  who desire further study, to do so.<br />All the chapters are well written: God as Trinity, creation, man, spirit, prayer, and eternity.  At times trying to understand the view point may be difficult, but this is due to a cultural make-up in approaching philosophy and theology.  An outstanding text.	2001-05-19

This book is one of his most easier to understand  material.  Here he writes for the average Christian and not the academic scholar.<br />The writing is engaging as Barth's essays deal with three different subjects, yet, compliment each other.  The first essay is &quot;Evangelical Theology in the 19th Century.&quot;  Barth concisely examines the dangers of liberal theology and the effects it had on the 20th Century.<br />The second essay is &quot;The Humanity of God&quot; of which the book is titled.  This essay is a Christological work and is well worth the read.<br />The last section, &quot;The Gift of Freedom&quot;, deals with the Christian life i regards to God's gift of Freedom.  Frredom is a gift from God that He alone can bestow on us.<br />This is a great work which is very easy to read and quick to get through (only 96 pages).  This book will inspire to read more works by this great Christian thinker.  Whether one agrees with him or not, Barth is always engaging.	2001-04-14

This work, presents a fair and balanced view about both sides (Geilser-Protestant/MacKenzie-Catholic: note -MacKenzie argues from teh Catholic viewpoint as a former Catholic, but is himself now a Protestant).  They both, as one reviewer put it, \\"go out of their way\\", to present non-emotional and non-trigger igniting arguments that only increase tensions.<br /><br />The format increases the superiority of this book.  The first section addresses the \\"agreements\\" between the two bodies.  This is important, because there are many things in common between the two.  Section two speaks about the differences.  This is well done, and easy for the lay reader to understand.  This is not a debate and it is not written as an evangelistic tool to sway individuals from one side to another (even though both would prefer if you were in their camp). The third section is on areas where we can cooperate together when going into the world.  Part two and three clearly demonstrates that we have more unity among each other than most want to admit.<br /><br />The differences are still great, but they should be discussed in a manner of love and honesty.  These authors do their best to do just that.  The book is great and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn the other side and encounter them with a more pure heart.  Not all the issues are discussed in fullness, however, this book is trying to speak to laity, not scholars and therefore, a more in-depth book would be self-defeating.  This work is just right.	2001-04-14

The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture	Books	4	16	19	N	N	One of Schaeffer's Best Works	This book, which was also produced into a film, is one of Schaeffer's best works.  This is because, he matches history, art, rise of cultures, etc, and compares them to a Christian worldview and how Western Culture has steadly declined after certain ideas have surfaced in soceity.<br />These ideas and their consequences are demonstrated and connected to certain events in history.  For example, he connects the Englightenment ideas to the French revolution and the horrors it produced.  (Another reviewer dismisssed this idea, however, it has been well documented by many historians that the French revolution and its terror was a result of Enlightenment thinking-because there were no moral restraints).<br />Schaefffer is not a historian, expert in art (even though he loved art) or a professional philosopher and sometimes  this is appearant as he makes some conclusions that are not completely warranted. For example, to connect humanistic ideas with Michelango's David is a far reach (P. 72).<br />The strength of his critique on the decline of Western Culture is in the realm of morals and virtues.  The assertions are warranted and very accurate.  It is also quite prophetic and chapters 8 thru 13 are well worth the read.<br />Lastly, coming from Schaeffer, this is a pleasent read.  Some of his books are slow and difficult to get through.  His style has often been burdensome.  This book, is very easy, yet, detailed, and not cumbersome in any way. A very good book on modern culture, even though it is twenty plus years old.	2001-04-13

With sophisticated plots and asorbing artwork, the reader  becomes intangled with the charaters as much as he or she would with any play, movie, or novel.  This collection, has two of Miller's greatist works:  The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Year One.  The third story is cute and works well in the collection as a bridge between the other two stories.<br />&quot;Batman: Year One&quot; is the first story in the collection (actually the last one of the three written) and it is a story that many Batman fans had hoped the fisrt Batman movie would have been based on.  It is well told, and the major players in the Batman saga are introduced:  Batman, Gordon, Alfed and Selina Kyle (Catwomen).  It is a well written story and as good as any in the last 20 years of any genre.<br />The second story in this special is &quot;Wanted:  Santa Claus-Dead or Alive.&quot;  This is a quick piece and doesn't involve too much, but does show a caring and revernt Batman.<br />The last is Miller's magnum opus, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns.&quot;  This four chapter story is spectacular and a great piece of work:  both in story telling and various artist expression.  This psychological drama deals with an aging Batman, who at the age of 55, comes back to fight crime after a ten year absence.  Miller insightfully deals with many subjects now addressed by our popular media.  For example, the idea of a liberal soceity blaming crime on the agents of heroism instead on personal evil.  Miller writes and demonstrates that victims are innocent people who try to live a virtous life, and Batman fights to protect a city dying of a cancer.<br />Comic collectors need this special leather bound book with commentaries by Richard Burning and Alan Moore.  Frank Miller himself writes some notes which personalizes this special edition that much more.	2001-03-10

Wallace fouces his attention on the method and make-up of his system that made him a champion.  The book dosn't try to be a book on sparring or fighting methods.<br />2/3 of the book is devoted to warming up, stretching, and footwork exercises.  This is helpful and concise - great for a begginer.  The photos are well done and his movements and mechanics are clear and therefore, allows someone to easily  copy Wallace's movements.<br />The book's strength is its accessibilty and easy to learn format - which is what I believe Mr. Wallace is after.

This critquie is even more respected because Dr. Noll is himself an evangelical.<br />The book traces the begining of the American evangelical movement and the influnces of the Scottish Enlightment and the cultural synergistic infusing of the American way into Christian life.  He demonstrates that the Scottish Enlightenment helped evangelicals develop a &quot;scientific and inductive&quot; approach to scripture regardless of the genre of the text: This and the American way being identified as the Christian way further led many American Christians inbracing a scewed interpretation of the Bible which help lead to Premillinial Dispensationalism.<br />The above mentioned theological perspective, which is probably the most widely held view among American evangelicals, has tended to focues on preaching to &quot;move, rather than instruct&quot; and views contempary issues as earth shattering  eschatlogical events.<br />Therefore, many fields of study like science have all but been neglected and the serious study of issues often neglected.  He concludes the book that the tide does seem to be changing and Chrsitians are beggining to  enter the intellectual aerna and felx their intellectual muscle. The book is very well written.  If we truly care about our country, we should see this book as a wake up call to respond to God by loving him with not just our hearts and sould, but our minds as well.	2001-02-19

Sproul has written a concise and clear text on the history of philosophy, its major contributers, and the ideas which sprang from these great minds.The strength of this book is its easy to read style that can attract non-philosophers who are interested in the subject and would like to understand the modern ideas and from which they come.<br />The book begins with a brief chapter on the &quot;Fisrt Philosophers&quot; and then sweeps through history  with chapter after chapter, reviewing and processing the greatest philosophers up to the present time: Plato, Aristotle, Agustine, Aquinas, Kierkegaard, Marx, Sarte and many more are discussed.<br />The reviewer who gave this book only one star has made some unfounded attacks.  The first attack, is that Dr. Sproul is not a fundamentalist Christian, but a Reformed Christian,and the differences, though similar in some respects are also in others, quite different.  Sproul's review of Nietzsche is on target and  the one sentence quoted by the previous reviewer, needs to be read in its entire context on &quot;The will to Power.&quot;  Old Friedrich's philosophies do allow for such uses against our fellow man, even if Nietzsche himself wouldn't have done so.<br />Further, this is a book about ideals and their consequences and Sproul does take a Cristian worldview position.  This is no reason to disregard a book because it may afront one's personal world-view. There is much to be learned from this text.<br />The chapters on Aquinas and Kiekergaard are outsanding.  The conclusion is the weakess point in the book and should have been better developed.  It is as Sproul was tired of writing and decided to stop; This is a problem in some of his other books Like &quot;The Last Days According to Jesus.&quot;<br />A highly recommemded the text.  After reading this book, I would suggest one purchase the more detialed work called &quot;Life's Ultimate Questions&quot; by Nash.	2001-02-18

This is by far les exhaustive than the others, but that is this books strength.  Aided by Ron Rhodes, formerly of the Cristian Research Insititute, this book aids a theologically correct Christian persepective on important scriptual verses that are often abused by cults such as Mormonism, International Church of Christ, and Jehovah's Witnesses.<br />The title, though &quot;catchy&quot;, is somewhat of an offense because some arguably Christian denominations are also listed.  Though the writers, Geisler and Rhodes, may not brand these denominations as cults, the title appears to lump them in altogether and to the person who already thinks that Roman Catholics or Seventh Day Adventists are cults, may also abuse the authors names in their assertions when discussing these issues with others.<br />The information, however is very accurate and the scripture commentary normally very sound and orthodox.  This book is a good resource and only the title should have been changed slightly.<br />If you are a Catholic or Adventists, this book is also a good resource tool for you.  Don't make the mistake of throwing the &quot;baby out with the bath water.&quot;  This book by itself, however, is not enough in understanding and dialoguing with cultist.  It is a good supplemental tool and I believe the authors would agree.<br />I recommend getting Geisler's two other books of this same genre.

Out of these series of books, this one is probably the best.  The contributors get right to the point and state their claims concisely.<br />Let me give an example on how this book affects one like myself.  See, my uncle Jim was a Baptist minister and I often went to his church only to hear &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; sermons.  Once, I even watched a film on hell.  Needless to say, he believed in the literal view.  For a couple of years, I became a Presbyterian and hell was hardly preached.  When it was spoken of, it was in a &quot;metaphorical&quot; sense.  Then during my teens, my mom converted to Seventh-Day Adventism and then I was fully indoctrinated into the &quot;conditional&quot; mortality view.<br />This book was good, because being an advid student of theology, I find this issue, though not essential, greatly interesting. Each side is represented by a highly qualified biblical expert.  I was disappointed with Dr. Walvood who defended the &quot;literal&quot; view of hell.  He was the least logical and in fact distorted the positions of others.  Since he is so well known and qualified, I find it curious that he didn't build a stronger case.  I was looking for a stronger case - something to challenge my presuppositions.<br />William Crockett (Metaphorical) and Clark Pinock (Conditional) presented their views the best.  Both supported their views from scripture and with sound logic and biblical hermeneutics.  Anyone with an open mind can see that these two positions call for more dialogue and study.  It is easy to dismiss the conditional view because it is held by cults like the Jehovah's Witnesses and border line Christian sects like the Seventh-Day Adventist.  To do this however, is to neglect the study of scripture  with an earnest heart and mind.<br />I left the SDA denomination long ago (1989), but still find the conditional view a compelling doctrine, however, Crockett presented a great case  and now for about seven years, I have had to re-think my position and seek further study into God's word.d the conditional view a compelling doctrine, however, Crockett presented a great case  and now for about seven years, I have had to re-think my position and seek further study into God's word.	2001-01-15

This book is more indepth and authoritative.  The primary sections are on Tradition, History, and the Pioneers who have helped shaped this multi-faceited idea of what we call &quot;martial arts.&quot;<br />The chapters are very good, providing excellent history and coverage.  America is probably a little over represented.  This however, doesn't mean they should have written less about American martial arts, just more of other traditions.<br />It must also be fair to say, that America has contributed much to the Asain arts and helped expand the arts, for better or worse, where they are today.  The photos are neat and add greatly to this book.  The writing is sometimes dry, like most reference works are.<br />All in all, it is a book that stands on its own and should be purcahsed by those martial artist who either are interested in history or having a quick refernce at their bookshelf.	2001-01-13

The subject of his book is a 29 year old black man named Brad.  After introducing you to Brad and the circumstances in his life, Mr Armstrong, thinks about his encounter with Brad and then writes a series of letters addressing Brad and his condition.  That condition and the many problems in Brad's life are what makes this book so interesting.<br />This leeter format, where we encounter one topic at a time, in a personal letter, opens up the issues on a down to earth style.  Not everyone will agree with Armstrong's insight and perespectives as to Brad's diagnosis of the &quot;black-man's&quot; condition in urban America, but the insightfullness is bound to stir dialogue.  Most liberals will outright dismiss this short work with straw men attacks and Ad Hominums.  Don not be fooled by such silly and distorted speak.  Instead, read this book for yourself and wrestle with these issue.<br />It is time the African-American community as a whole see a different view about the dangers hurting their own people.	2001-01-10

The story basically deals with sacrificing ones-self to protect those whom you love and care about.  It raises the question:  How does one do this?<br /><br />Wonder Women choose the road of hiding the truth and, what looks to be betrayal of friends, for what she considers the greater cause to save their lives.<br /><br />It begs the questions whether this is the right course of action?  Even though she is victories, she herself defies the prophecy about the JLA destruction with her own survival. (To know what that prophecy is, one must read the book). Did she choose well?  The reader is left to decide.<br /><br />That is the only problem, is that the author didn't steer the reader to a moral high ground and even though Wonder Woman's actions aren't really endorsed, one comes away thinking she might have done the right thing (if this was a philosophy class, one could argue against her actions solidly). Other than that, the book is well worth the read and get this in the hard back before it becomes a paperback.  The artwork is splendid to say the least.	2001-01-04

Please disregard Ad Hominem reviews that slander the auther without seriously engaging his message.  The book is not a detialed analysis of social problems and it isn't intended to be.  It is addressing that African-American urban culture has relied extensively on the idea of victimization.<br />Most of this book is done with each chapter being opened in a letter format as he writes to us by writing to a young black man who considers himself to be a victim of, well - just about everything. The young man doesn't see how he is responsible for many of his criminal and immoral behavior. This letter format is effective and if people can, for a moment put aside their biases, maybe they willlearn something or at least, understand a different perspective on the issue.<br />One does not have to agree with all of Mr. Armstrong's points to fully grasp that he is addressing a very real problem amoung young black men.

The book has over 29 authors and is edited by D.A. Carson.  It is divided into eight parts with each part having many essays describing the issues and challenges facing, mostly, but not exculsively, North American soceity and its post-modern culture (I say mostly because other countries are represtented).<br />Ravi Zacharias opens the discussions in part one about opening dialogue about truth and Christianity in a post-modern culture.  The opening is great and dynamic.  Other issues discussed are religious pluralism, epistemology, uniqueness of Jesus Christ, and the current state of our most hailed universities and how to effectively reach this group of young adults.<br />As with all books of this kind, having so many authors does tend to interrupt the flow of reading and sometimes ideas become redundant; however, this problem is not prevelant in this text and should not discourage the reader in any way.

In &quot;Chosen But Free&quot;, Dr Geisler tries to strike a balance between Arminian (Man's free will) and what he calls extreme Calvinism (God's Total election based on His will).<br />Dr Geisler holds to the position of what he calls moderate Calvinism, which is that both God's election of the saints and humanity's free will are both true in this line of tension.  Geisler correctly points out some of the logical and Biblical flaws in the Calvinist position.<br />Some of the cirtics to this book have mis-represented Geisler's position.  Geisler is letting &quot;God be God&quot;, by demonstarting the truth of God's message in this debate.  The extreme Calvinist have always been selective in their use of scripture and the book points this out.<br />While there are some weakness with the Arminian position, Geisler spends less time on the subject and uses it basically to contrast the two positions and then spell out the moderate Calvinist position that we are free as well as elected.	2000-11-25

In the first two chapters, Ravi carefully sets the parameters of his thesis and where he is starting from.<br />Even though he has been often critized, Ravi clearly asserts that his position is that true atheism is the  person who maintains that there is no God: He quotes this definition from the Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  Ravi then, using much of Nietzsche's life and teachings as a framework on which to build his case.<br />Chapters on &quot;Getting to the Truth&quot;, &quot;Humanity's Dilema&quot; and &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; are probably the books strongest  and most rewarding reading.  Here in these chapters, is where he most forcefully asserts his case against the existential arguments for Atheism.<br />  Ravi's point is that in atheistism, there are no compeling reasons (logically or otherwise)to be good. He doesn't say that all atheist are evil, just that when atheism is evil, it is rationally acceptable to be so.<br />Ravi's book, however, does fail to be exhaustive.  There are too many quick historical references without enough historical context.  This may have led many not to read the book, but would have given more knowledge and insight to people who are, whether in support of or against his position, more seriously.<br />This book focuses on the existential questions of Theism and Atheism.  If the reader is looking for arguments asserting the truth of Theism the I recommend J.P. Moreland's book &quot;Scaling the Secular City.&quot;  If the reader wants a book with both views equally expressed then read &quot;Does God Exist&quot;, by J.P. Moreland (Theist) and Kia Nielson (Atheist).	2000-11-24

She is a good writer and the editors did a good job in regards to pictures within the text.  With that said, my compliaments end.<br />She has written a book that uses &quot;Straw Men&quot; like a fish drinks water. The problems with Christendom have been plenty; however, so have the successes.  As a matter of fact, the successes far outweigh the failures. She fails to understand the dynamics of serious scholarship and treats the early and middle aged church as evil bishops and popes who suppresses evidences for power.  These broad brushing assertions are just intellectually silly.<br />Her non squiturs are many and logical fallacies often.  For example, she writes on page 22, &quot;Two popes would ban the seventeenth century Spanish unu Maria d'Ahreda's book, The Mystical City of God, for implying a trinity between God, Mary and Jesus.  All allusions to the value of difference were lost.&quot;  If the difference is in error, is it of any value?  Of course not.  There is in no way can anyone can induce or deduce a trinity from New Testament documents and early church writings. The matter is truth, not difference!  I'm not Catholic, but this is why they banned the book.<br />She further has a chapter asserting the churches role in the Inquisition  and slavery.  Yet, most of the people punished in the inquisition were other Christians and it was the illogical out working of &quot;Orthodox Christian&quot; teaching, which is what she disdains - othordox Christianity.  Further, slavery receives very little mention at all.  The entire chapter is devoted to the inquisition.<br />Finally, she disregards important social  structures of the time that led to many problems in the church such as the Investiture Controversy that led to kings having much of the say in church affairs and the appointment of bishops.  She further fails to mention that it was the church that rid of slavery, educated the poor, and cared for the sick.<br />The subject needed more diligence and intelelctual honesty.  There were and still are problems in Christendom, but lets please keep our intellectual faculties in place and not allow our agendas, whatever they may be, scew the pursuit of thruth.of slavery, educated the poor, and cared for the sick.<br />The subject needed more diligence and intelelctual honesty.

I think Derek Prince really believes this tortured interpretation of such Biblical texts that deal with faith, demons, blessings and curses.

The reviewer from Vancover, WA, who unfairly rates this book low, brings up that Godel and Brouwer have demonstrated the inability of logic (paraphased);But didn't they use logic to reach that conclusion? - yes they did.  Without logical thinking, all our statements and beliefs become nonsensical!  Either logic is used or abused.<br />Geisler and Brooks have written a great text and its only real (possible) flaw is that it is written from a conservative Christian viewpoint.  Myself a Christian, I do see problems with people who will unfairly rate this book low or not give it a fair reading because of the overtly Christian stance.  With that said, this is also the book's strength, because many Christians need to learn logic and may turn to this book because of the Geilser and Brook's religious position.<br />The chapters on &quot;informal fallacies&quot; and &quot;scientific thinking&quot;  are extremely well written for the primer level.

Books	4	13	26	N	N	Life By Design	This book was originally published in 1982 by Dr. Henry Morris (hydraulics and geology) and Dr. Gary Parker (Biology - ex-evolutionist). The book's strength is definitely the first section which concentrates on the life sciences. Gary Parker is well versed in the area and exposes many of the presuppositions of the evolutionist mind set. Their ideology of naturalism blinds them to other, more reasonable interpretations of the data.<br /><br />The chapter on the fossil evidence is solid, yet, the layman can easily understand the material. He doesn't \\"bog\\" the reader with too much jargon - a plus in any biological study. The second section is written by Dr Morris and is not as enjoyable to read and the information doesn't always \\"add up.\\" However, one reviewer of this book called Morris a liar because of the information presented. This reviewer fails to understand critical thinking and, for balance, it must be noted that Morris has different interpretations on magnetic field study and \\"moon dust.\\" Further the information he presented in 1982 on \\"moon dust\\" was up to date considering he was using studies of data recorded only seven years prior.<br /><br />The argument I find more troubling however, and most creationists always rely on it, is the \\"entropy\\" example. There are anomalies here and creationist shouldn't always try and resort to this tactic. Because the physical laws are always in \\"entropy\\" doesn't mean that biological sciences cannot increase; at least the case hasn't been made in my view.<br />Overall, they stay on science and do not resort to scripture in any way. This is another strength since the first tactic made by most evolutionists is that \\"creationists\\" want to teach the Bible as science. If anyone reads that interpretation into this book, he or she will only demonstrate their concerted effort for evolution dogma - Genesis is not mention. Give this book at least a fair hearing.	2000-08-26

This is hard because so  much of this book is so bad.  The are only two redeeming values: (1) Bishop  Spong is a skilled writer and (2) a person gets to climb inside the mind of  an extreme liberal theologian.<br />Bishop Sppong's liberal bias is so evident  that he often is self-refuting.  He calls everyone and positions who/which  seems to disagree with him such trigger words like dishonest,  spin-doctoring, fundamentalist, and distorting the truth.<br />Of course,  Spong is therefore self-refuting as he, more than anyone is the master of  theolical &quot;spin doctoring&quot; and dishonesty.  He claims on page 111  that the Bible is wrong because it was used to promote slavery and  segregation.  This lack of logic is frightening.  This doesn't mean the  Bible is wrong, but those individuals who distorted scripture for the  purpose of salvery are wrong.  Didn't the abolitionist use scripture to  free men?  Is the Bible now also right.<br />This is just an example of his  useless logic.  Read only for the understanding how individuals who are  blinded by idealogy will disregard evidence in favor of their own agenda.	2000-08-24

Compared to most philosphy of religion books, Brian Davies  does an excellent job in reviewing, describing, explaining, and showing the  strengths and weakness of each metaphysical idea without showing too much  of a bias one way or the other.<br />This text is small, yet, thorough.  He  deals masterfully with some of the biggest arguments for God:  Ontological,  cosmological, and teleogical as well as others.  His chapter on miracles is  easy to understand and well written.  The book doesn't try to sway the  student  in any direction, but instead, shows that it is reasonable to  believe or not to believe in God.<br />Well balanced.	2000-08-23

This is,  however, one of the worse books written on the subject of Christian  theology in many of years.  Spong is so bent on destroying traditional  Christianity, he makes several fundamental errors in hermenutics and logic.  Since he is well educated, I can only assume that his goal is to falsly  decieve the reader.<br />For example, Spong asserts that the gospels at times  demonstrate Jesus as someone who at times is hypocritical and vindictive.  He cites the case where Jesus said he came to set a man against his father  and daughter against her mother.<br />Did Spong ever hear of the word,  Hyperbole?  Most scholars, even liberal ones, agree on this subject in this  text.  He further lumps all Christians who are conservative as  fundamentalist.  If you disagree with Spong, your a fundamentalist.  This  is just plain dishonest.  Christianity isn't monolithic - Spong knows  better.<br />Lastly, he continually makes the mistake of  &quot;eisogesis&quot;, when he continually personifies scripture on want it  means to him, when it is clear that the text is a historical-narrative.  Spong is a demythologizer, which is an intellectual cop-out.<br />This book  will appeal to the intellectual weakling who wants to think himself or  herself mentally strong.  To the honest theist or atheist, this book is  nothing but a dust collector.	2000-08-23

There are a couple of  reviewers who gave this  book one star.  I would like to ask, then quiz  them to see if they are honest, and really read the contents of this book.  One of those reviewres claims that the author takes a literal transaltion  of scripture and uses selective verses to support creationist positions.  Does he even understand the creationist positions?  After all, there are  many and I find it hard to put Heeren into the hyper-creationists such as  Dr Morris.<br />I appauld the author of this book, because he at times  critizes some young earth creationist because the evidence doesn't support  it (pp 188 and 195). He further doesn't always use literal interpretations  of scripture.  He also writes about the theological principle on what the  first chapter of Genesis is about and cites respected Old Testament  scholars like Gleason Archer who demonstrate that the 24 hour days in  Genesis may not mean a 24 hour day.  This is accepted by many conservative  theologians as well and therefore I can rightly assume that those reviewers  didn't read the book at all.<br />Many more instances could be cited to  refute the silly reviewers who slamed this book with false representations,  however, the above example should suffice for this forum.<br />Heeren's thesis  is that scientific method demonstrates a creator has made our universe.  This he does very well by writing about the Big Bang and its implications,  which many scientis avoid.  They avoid this because it does demonstarte  there is a first cause and this first cause could have been God.<br />The book  is strong in the area of physic, but lacks in the realm of biological  science.  This is because it is a volume one and I only hope more volumes  continue.  The reading is dry at times and some information seems to  lengthy for the layman.<br />All in all, it is a must for anyone who is  seriously studying the subject of orgins.

The author here is not making any judgements but does give data from his expierence as a clinical  therapist.  All subjects are written about and most of it is looked at  through the lens of a counselor and the range of fantasies people have in  their lives.  Even though I'm a conservative Christian and many in my ranks  would probably disagree with (1) my reading this book in th efirst place  and (2) my high approval rating; honesty still compells me to do so.<br />I  gained greater insight into many sexual appetites and think this helps me  understand many things about other people, as well as about myself.  I  don't care for the over secularized approached in all areas and in some  respects the condemnation of Christian ethics (the author may be religious  himself, I don't know, but he does take a Freudian -simplistic view on  Christiananity and sex).<br />Still, this was an insightful read and at  times, I must admit erotic.  Which only taught me more about myself.  I  think my wife enjoyed it also.  This book in the end affirms monogomy and  gives tips on how couples can grow in thier relationship.	2000-08-14

It is no wonder that he could arguably be one of the most proliftic  Christian writers in the last few years. I am not really a fan of Lucado's  work.  Not becasue he isn't a skilled writer, but instead, because I enjoy  more apologetic type material (if and when I'm not reading my deeply moving  and insightful Batman comics).  This new book, &quot;He Chose The  Nails&quot;, is probably his best work since &quot;In The Grip of  Grace.&quot;<br />This book is heart felt and honest.  In writing it, Max  often refers to the lessons he has learned in life, and then makes a great  parable for the reader.  This is always his strength - his ability to  communicate to just about anyone who is willing to listen.  His points and  lessons are well made.  He is funny, honest, as well as hopeful and sad.  In a quick two hours, the reader, approaching this material in a spirit of  openness, will expierence many emotions:  hope, loss, joy, sadness,  laughter, and peace.<br />This book is an outstanding read.  Pastor Lucado's  style is easy, yet, insightful.  He gets right to the point and draws on a  vast-array of expierence and stories to guide the reader to his  conclusions.  No mis-interpretation about the thesis or conclusion here.  The opening, middle and end-game are skillfully woven into a heart felt,  deeply moving read.	2000-08-13

Out of the many debate books, this one is probably one of the best  assembled.  William Lane Craig and John Dominic Crossan are both considered  scholars in their field by academia.  The contributors are also noteworthy  experts in this field and lend other view points as to the resurrection of  Jesus Christ.<br />William Lane Craig, who belives in the physical  resurrection of Christ states an outstanding opening address and concisely  gives his views.  Crosssan does a good job and he is very articulate,  however, his logic is more convuluted.  He admits his presuppositions and  for this is honesty is admired.  What he fails to understand is that his  premise is weak, although valid, and therefore, he has an up hill battle in  this debate from the begginning.<br />Lane Craig wins the rebuttle hands  down.  It isn't even close.  The discussion period by Craig, Crossan and  Buckely is interesting and fun.  After reading the book, I bought the audio  version, and this three way discussion is more fun in the audio  tapes.<br />The contributions are good but the conservative writers clearly  presented better arguments for Christ resurrection than their counerparts  could provide against the resurrection of Jesus.<br />I disagree with the  reviewer who said the liberal scolars didn't take this debate seriously  because they appeared to have been out gunned.  I believe they did.  The  problem on why they lost this debate could be for a many a number of  reasons.<br />The main reason why they lost however, is because the evidence  in the historical method of investigation supports a belief in the  resurrection of Christ. This is why in most professional debates, between  atheist and theist, the theist usually wins (not always).  For another  debate in written format I suggest you read &quot;Does God Exist?&quot; by  J.P. Moreland and Kia Nelsen.	2000-08-11

This book, originally loaned to me by an atheist friend of mine, who was trying to convert me, was later given to me as a birthday present. Tim Berra states his bias up front and I'm glad he did, because, his bias is clearly seen throughout the text.<br />There is some good biological information here. But since the book is wrought with such logical errors (the rules of logic must apply to science) one would be better looking for a different text. He makes many mistakes : Berra himself says, &quot;The scientific method involves the observation of phenomena or events in the real world...(page 2). But how does one observe macro-evolution? How can one test it for &quot;predictive value&quot;? When on page 129 he states that biologist have seen species evolve; he uses a case involving design.<br />He also makes the mistake of an analogy fallacy when he explains evolutionary change useing the corvette as an analogy. The car is designed and modified by a designer. This is evidence for creation, not evolution. He even quotes outdated and discarded experiments such as Stanely Miller's.<br />In one portion of the book, he claims there is an abundant amount of fossil evidence for evolution, only in another section, he says, &quot;Thus transitional forms between species should be rare in the fossil record.&quot; Well, which is it? Lastly, he claims many Creationist have mis-quoted evolutionists and out right lied. This has been true, however, he does basically the same thing. He quotes the Scopes Trial, yet, doesn't give the entire facts on why the trial was ever conducted in the first place. This is important for understanding the context of the debate.<br />If one is looking for a book on the strengths of evolution, I would refer you to Sagon's &quot;Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors&quot; and Dawkins, &quot;The Blind Watchmaker.&quot; Even though I disagree with these viewpoints, the books are well written and present a better case for evolution.

The strengths of this book is the detialed research conducted on four major denominations: Christian Science, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, and Seveth Day Adventist (I grew up an Adventist and can positively assure the reader that Martin did an accurate job on representing the position of the church). I was a strong committed Adventist, but after reading this book, I exaimed my beliefs and after two years left the church. NOTE: Walter Martin considers the Seventh Day Adventist church to be a Christian denomination, but I left because I wanted to find a church that subscribed to the important issues in the church, unlike Adventistism which focuses on Sabbath keeping, and End Times.<br />The book does however, have some week points. He only scratches the service on such religions as Unity, Baha'i, and Islam. This is more than likely due to the influence these cults had on most of America in the 60's, which is nominal, and therefore, only an introductory look was given. However, this is still a weekness and must be noted. If one is looking for detialed answers about Eastern religions or liberal Christian sects, they should look elseworld. These groups are just not represented with the same information as the latter groups mentioned.<br />Hank Hannegraffs addition on the faith movement is good and it is honest for him to inculde this group in the book. Martin further writes about how the mind of cults work and why this is important &quot;mission field.&quot;<br />In other reviews written, there are a few attacks against this book. These attacks are without merit. A person doesn't have to agree with the theises and can still give it a low rating without resorting to rantings about &quot;religious intolerance&quot; and unshcolarly work. The work and research is impeccable, whether one agrees with his conclusions or not. Further, Martin doesn't claim that these cults should be made illegal. He asserts that we should share the good news of Christ and demonstrate the errors of these other sects. That is not intolerance, but dialogue, and it is severly missing in todays churches.rther, Martin doesn't claim that these cults should be made illegal.

The books were written after a series of  lectures given by Francis Schaffer.  As a philosopher, Schaffer is  minimual.  He doesn't fully explain certain ideas well enough like the law  of non-contradiction and sometimes his syllogism are muddled and other  possibilities seem to be left out. However,there are many good things in  this book.<br />He does a pretty good job in tacking how in the world , we the  church, &quot;gave over&quot; the intellectual culture to the secular  world.  This he does with extreme effectiveness.  His chapter on &quot;The  Importance of Truth&quot; and  his theme of &quot;the line of despair&quot;  are important concepts and he  again is effective in communicating these  ideas to  the reader.<br />Reading Schaeffer is not an easy task.  One always  gets the feeling that engaging him in converstaion would be, to put it  mildy, a &quot;blast.&quot;  When reading his materials, however, the  communcative style is static and at times, long winded. Overall, his thesis  works and the book is enjoyable as the reader agrees one moment and  disagrees the next.

My wife enjoyed the book as well, even  though she had already been in karate for some time.<br />The book does what  it is supposed to do; help a women in the beggining stages of the martial  arts.

US	49286822	R3IPA2ZXINJJ90	0897500164	777898926	Winning Tournament Karate	Books	2	5	9	N	N	Little To Offer	This book, written by Chuck Norris in 1975, the year he retire from sport karate competition, has very little to offer the karate student.  The book doesn't have much material in written information, but instead, relies on  still photography to teach the karate  student certian sport karate  techniques, such as entry techniques and striking drills.  Overall, the  book is a very weak presentation on point fighting.<br />I highly admire Chuck  Norris and if one would rather read books authored by him they should read  &quot;The Secret Power Within&quot; or his autobiography.  These books are  informative and at times, insightful.  If someone is looking for a good  book on sport karate and how to improve their sparring skills, I highly  recommend the superior  book &quot;American Freestyle Karate&quot; by Dan  Anderson.	2000-07-30

The first section is a biographary on Joe Lewis, considered by many in the martial arts world as the gretest karate fighter of all time; hence the  title of the book.  This section is at times, written in the first and  third person, so the reader gets an idea as to what goes inside the mind of  Lewis. This part is frank and sincere and many things said may not be well  like by traditionalist.<br />Lewis speaks about his training in Okinawa, the  states and with Bruce Lee.  He talks about pioneering full-contact karate  (aka kickboxing)and point karate.  The next section, American Karate  Fighting is the bulk of the book.<br />It also is a let down.  The quality of  the photos is average.  The book works, but for someone who has studied the  martial arts for over 20 years, nothing new is really mentioned.  The  traditional fighter may see something new, but, I doubt many  traditionalists, who are not into contemporary fighting ideas, will  probably not be interested in this book anyway.<br />The book is average at  best (Probably could rate it lower but think that to get a little inside  the mind of Lewis is worth the average rating)and for a skilled writer like  Dr. Beasely (The Way of No Way), I expected a lot more.	2000-07-29

Greg Garber has written a technically accurate boxing exposition without getting boring or to  technical.  The biographies are short, yet informative, and may give the  reader a spark to get  more materials on certain boxing hereos.  Most of  boxing top legends are here; Ali, Marciano, Louis and Dempsey.  There is  also a section on some of the greatest fights in history.  This is the one  flaw because it is too small and some other great fights are not there for  the reading.<br />The photographs are colorful and the book is outlined  wonderfully.As an adult and boxing fan, I found this book to be a fun time  even though I was already familiar with most of the fighters.  This book is  a enjoyable read and I think young people will have a great time reading  about the boxers who pioneered the sport before them.	2000-07-29

The book does have some strengths.  I finished it in a little over an hour (174 pages) because it reads very easily.  The  sentences are constructed for quick reading.  The book, although a nice  read, is better suited for teenagers than adults. The author repeats the  same information in chapter after cahpter.  He mentions the same  extraordinary feats accomplished by Oyama over and over again.  After  awhile it grows a little tiresome.  There are good points , however, that  make this a must book for the library of any serious karateka.<br />Reading  about the perseverance  of Oyama in his karate training, establishing his  dojo headquarters called Honbu, and philospohy on thruth brings a better  understanding about this legend.  The chapter on the martial arts saying  &quot;osu&quot; is also very good and it is in this chapter that the author  Michael Lorden does his best work.  This chapter alone makes the book a  must purchase.	2000-07-28

I first read this book in 1998.  Why I read Spong's books at all is a wonder; except that I gain  insight into the mind of people who are more concerned about \\"easy  believism\\" than a true exegesis of biblical study.  Spong's thesis is  essentially that the Church must change many of its traditional beliefs;  Its understanding of Christ, its ethics, and the meaning of prayer.<br /><br />  The  problem, however, is that Spong misses the point of Christianity in its  social construct.  Christianity is to change the culture, not vice-versa.  In Song's Christianity we are left where a culture can believe what they  want about Christ (as long as it is a so-called postmodern version).  God  is not a personal being who wants to enter into a relationship with  humankind, but instead, is non-personal.  He calls this God the  \\"ground of all being\\", an idea coined by the theologian Paul  Tillich.<br /><br />  Spong's non-sequiturs are many as he unsuccessfully tries to weave and intertwine a new age Christ for a new age culture where every thing except traditional Christianity is excepted.  He claims to  \\"believe in Jesus, called Messiah, or Christ\\" (page 221).  But  this begets the question?  What Jesus? for surely the Jesus of the gospels is  far different than his Jesus.<br /><br />Further, it must be stated that if we are  to look at Spong's message objectively, then so far we can only conclude  that his brand of Christianity is failing.  He is putting a knife to the  church's throat faster than  what he calls \\"Fundamentalism.\\"  In  the years he was a Newark Bishop, the membership fell almost in half.  People who really search for God are also searching for either truth or a  helper.  They want there lives changed and transformed by God - not the  other way around.<br /><br />Lastly, I would like to give this book only one star, but honesty compels me to give it two.  Whatever else can be said of Bishop Spong, he isn't a bad writer.  His book flows even with the non-sequiturs.  The style is likeable and easy to read.tever else can be said of Bishop Spong, he isn't a bad writer.  His book flows even with the non-sequiturs.  The style is likeable and easy to read.	2000-07-28

The book is humorous at times because of his witty style, yet always serious and shedding light on this topic of martial arts.  He effectively writes  about the differences between the traditional martial arts and the  &quot;western&quot; approach, which emphasis on combat effectiveness and  sport.  The book can also be read by someone who has never studied the  arts.  He doesn't use a lot of &quot;karate jargon.&quot;  When he does use  an unfamiliar term, he gives a quick definition.<br />He has also mixed  photographs and artwork into the book which gives it an extra flavor.  The  artwork is multifaceted; serioous, humorous, and at times, reverenced.  Most topics are discussed:  Sport karate, kata, combat fighting, and how to  find a good school.  Instructors will benefit from this book as well as he  speaks about many innovative topics as developed in the western world.	2000-07-28

This book is not a standard &quot;primer&quot; on martial art movements and technquies, but instead, is a masterpiece in giving the karateka tools,  both mentally and physically, to enhance their sparring abilities.<br />  The  book discusses everything from entry and retreat to attacking and  defending.  Ideas are explored such as offensive and defensive attacking  postures.The book discusses sparring for tournament, the dojo (training  hall) and self-defense. This book was published in 1982 and still remains  the epitome of sparring manuels.  An absolute must!	2000-07-25

It is a great guide for the martial artist and fills in many gaps in his or her training.  For example, Morgan has a chapter on Honor.  He is right when he states that we in the martial arts  \\"world\\" hear the word \\"honor\\" often, but, never have  its definition articulated to us.  He gives a groundwork of tenets  (obligation, justice, and courage)and builds a thesis as to why these  tenets are important to martial artist of all belt ranks.  Even though I  think his tenets are incomplete, but nerveless insightful; it is a great  start, and he is the first to forcefully lay down such a well reasoned  view in a long time.<br /><br />The book is full of training ideas and incorporating the martial  arts into one's \\"everyday\\" life.  I often refer to this book when  I have not lived up to one of the tenets and strive to be a better martial  artist and  after reading this book, a better man.	2000-07-25
US	49286822	RA1Q9SG4OGBYO	4079741790	725059358	Karate: Technique and Spirit	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A Gem	This book, may at first glance, seem a bit &quot;pricey&quot;, however, it is a great primer book, printed on high quality paper.  The techniques are standard karate type fare:  Blocks, punches, and kicks.  What makes this  book such a collectable is that the author and publisher, write a beautiful  introduction as to what the spirit of karate is really all about.  They  arrange the photos, bioagraphies of students, demonstrations, and martial  arts tenets in a masterful way.  This book will probably not add much to  the black belts (assuming he is well studied) knowledge of the subject of  karate, but, it will add much to his vision on a masterful way to write and  publish a karate primer book.  He or she will further just enjoy the book  for what it is: a great work of art.<br />To the beginning or intermediate  student, this book will engage his or her imagination.  The section on  ethical and moral values of karate is short, sweet, and to the point.  The  last chapter on &quot;Karate Meditation Lectures&quot; is outstanding and  not pretentious.  If you are a karateka - purchase this book for the beauty  of it.	2000-07-25

He has written other books such as  \\"Christianity In Crisis\\" (his first and  greatest work) and the \\"The FACE that Demonstrates The Farce of  Evolution\\" (another primer book).  Hank's strength is his easy to read  writing style which allows him to reach an audience who want to read a book  either quickly or they are embarking a new subject.<br /><br />  For this reason,  \\"Resurrection\\" works.  If someone is either trying to study this  outstanding feat in history for the first time or learn more about their  belief and how to defend it; this book is a great read and will give much  food for thought without straining the brain.  The book falls, however, in  two areas:  (1) It is not a book for serious academic study.  It gives  quick easy tips to help one defend their belief  against the average  atheist or agnostic.  The average Christian is ill prepared to defend his  or her beliefs (so is the average unbeliever).  But the serious skeptic can  raise serious objections and therefore, one may want to delve into other  works such as \\"Jesus Under Fire\\" and \\"When Skeptics  Ask.\\"<br /><br />  The biggest flaw of the book is when he deals with ideals  such as cremation and sex.  Much here is speculation and does not lend  itself with a book which is trying to deal with facts of history.  It is  distracting in my view and this material could have been reserved for  another book dealing with speculative issues.<br /><br />All in all, the book is a  nice and easy read.  I wanted to give the book a higher rating because I  admire Hank Hannegraff and I am a support of CRI.  I enjoyed the material  but felt more material should have been added in the realm of history and  manuscript evidence.  The book will be a great read for people who have  never really studied the subject before, but for the serious student, it  will be a leisure read and only a quick reference text.reference text.	2000-07-08

This book, \\"Relativism: Feet Firmly Planted In Mid-Air\\", demonstrates the non-sequinters of the moral relativists  positions.  This text is written in an easy-to-read style which makes it a  must for they layman.  Further, the book gives some compelling arguments  against relativism and has a chapter on \\"Relativism's Seven Fatal  Flaws\\" which helps the average reader more easily understand the  inconsistency of the moral relativists' position.<br /><br />  The only real flaw in  this book is that the book will probably repel emotional persuaded  individuals who are relativists.  In the begging of the book, when  discussing the current tortured state of our relative society, the authors  should have used more statistics on the problems of our society: i.e.,  crime, teen pregnancy, etc.  There are many studies that have been conducted  in recent years to empirically demonstrate the utterly hopelessness of  relativism. Some more stories on these \\"real cases\\" would maybe  penetrate the relativists mind a little so they would be at least open to  the idea of moral absolutes.	2000-07-05

This book is well edited by Peter Kreeft.  Unlike many books of this sort, Kreeft's introduction aids the  reader into the debate and if one is new to the questions of philosophy,  the background provided become even more important.  The debate itself is  average.  Even though I admire JP Moreland and think he is a great  Christian theist, he would receive an average rating.  Kai Nielson,  however, does a poor job and I agree with another reviewer that Moreland  would have been better &quot;stacked&quot; against Keith Parson, one of the  book's contributors.<br />  The book's strength are the writings from the  editor (Kreeft) and the contributors (Christians: Craig and  Willard/Atheist:  Flew and Parsons).  The contributions are thought  provoking and the writers takle the subject head on.  Even though I'm  parcell to Dr Craig, I think all the contributors did an outstanding job in  analyzing the debate.  For their comments alone, this book is well worth  the time and price.	2000-07-04
