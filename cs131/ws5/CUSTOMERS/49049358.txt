US	49049358	R38TBBQUSZB71E	0743245423	732518745	Last Car to Elysian Fields: A Dave Robicheaux Novel	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Another hit  in a great series	I have read all of the novels in the Dave Robicheaux series. I have thought that on the whole they are a fantastic series. The characters are always well draw and original. If you have read the series like I have you have a real interest in what happens to the hard luck Robicheaux. I can honestly say I worry in every novel that he will start drinking again. That kind of attachment to a fictional character is few and far between. This is perhaps a bit darker novel in terms of the main character. His third wife Bootsie has died (natural causes)and his house has burned to the ground. It is very obvious that he is even more troubled then in novels past. Once again you wonder if he will finally order that shot of Beam with a Jax on the side. As with the other novels in this series Clete Purcel is involved. I don't think there is a better \\"side-kick\\" in this genre as great as Clete. I thought the best description of him came from Robicheaux's mouth when he said that \\"We are opposite sides of the same coin\\". To be honest I would love to see a novel with Clete as the main character. In closing all I can say is that if you have read this series before (you kind of have to, to understand Robicheaux) then this will be another great addition to the series.	2005-01-07
US	49049358	R2FRE4ZXBZVT6	0425186873	555280414	Red Mafiya	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Interesting look at the Russian Mob	Having grown up very close to Brighton Beach It was interesting to read about some of the crimes and events that happened in the area.I thought the book was very interesting in terms of portraying the leading underworld figures and their rise to the top. Some of the information the author imparts is very disturbing, how far-reaching the mob is and the different things they are involved in. Having said that it's a very colorfull history of the Russian Mafia.	2004-12-21
US	49049358	RITRMKCI8T5B6	0316009571	224255669	London Bridges	Books	2	3	3	N	N	Nice start but the ending was just BAD!	I have read all of the Alex Cross novels. Some are better then others. I read the Big Bad Wolf in a day and thought it was pretty good. I figured the author would not be able to have Cross dispatch the bad guy for a couple of books due to the mysery surrounding his identity. I started London Bridges looking forward to a good novel. At the start it was indeed a very good story. However the ending was perhaps one of the worst I have ever seen. I don't want to give anything away but it was like the author was bored and wanted to finish the novel quickly. So he cooked up the dumb solution to catching the Wolf. It ruined the whole book for me. Why must all of the authors novels be so damn short? Either leave a cliffhanger or just write a bigger book! The ending just made no sense.	2004-12-21

The idea of this novel was rather original. The characters were well drawn and I really liked the central villian as well. Three brothers heading into the jungle  in search of their Father's fortune. As always the journey is the best part. There is a little bit of everything in this book, keeps you turning pages which to me is the MOST important part of a good book.	2004-08-23

This time the creepy one is in the heartland of America investigating a series of murders. The characters are VERY well written and the story is well plotted. You are unsure as to who the bad guy is until after the halfway point. Some people might gripe about the identity of the murderer but if you do then you have not read the other works of these author(s). I thought it was a rather ghoulish twist and highlighted the whole \\"creepy little town\\" vibe. I just picked up the next Pendergast novel..I'm quite sure it will be just as good as this one. Bravo!	2004-08-23

It seemed like the perfect book for my daily 2.5 hour commute home from work. The premise of a creature running amok in the Pentagon ripping people to shreds is too good to pass up. However towards the half way mark it became obvious (painfully so) what the plot twist was and how the book was going to end. I could not believe that the author was moving the story in this direction. Why? to what purpose? (I Don't want to give anything away) It started off great and it ended rather badly. Give it a try you might like dumb plot twists.	2004-08-23

I would have to say that it was a great ending to the the series. I really don't want to give away anything major but suffice to say you will not be sorry you picked it up. The only problem I have with this series is that there is never really any doubt that all will turn out well in the end. It would be nice to see the heroes get a few bumps along the way or to have the ending in doubt. Now having said that I will say that this is a great book as is the rest of the Riftwar series.	2004-06-22

It was non-stop action. Well Scarecrow is even BETTER!From the start of the book it is one awesome gun battle,explosion, car/boat/plane/missle chase after another. Reilly is my favorite author. NOBODY can write a novel the way he can. Caution if you are one of those wanna-be Tom Clancy guys who like to complain about the details &quot;That was all wrong the wxr-89 fires a .6754mm shell not a .6755mm one!&quot; Then this is NOT for you, go read the latest issue of Solider of Fortune. This book is for anyone who enjoys a exciting out of this world story with lots of things blow up and cool weapons. Perfect for the long commute home. The only problem is that it is so good you will read it in hours, leaving you begging for more. PLEASE tell me that the Black Knight will get his own book. Just make sure you read Ice-Station first, then pick this up and enjoy.	2004-05-25
US	49049358	R3ID6VTVZ181NL	0385488866	345588177	Missing Links	Books	5	9	9	N	Y	FANTASTIC!!!!! A GREAT READ	Let me start out by saying that this is the best book I have read since the last Reilly book I picked up (Who's your Caddy?). I'm sure everyone know who Rick Reilly is, he is the ONLY reason to read Sports Illustrated. This novel is no exception to the Reilly Rule (Read anything he writes). I would read the phone-book cover to cover if he wrote it.  Missing Links is the story of a group of &quot;chops&quot; that play on the worst muni in the country (Ponky). When I started reading it I was hooked right away, the characters are original and pretty funny as well. The writing is pure Reilly at his best, witty as well as poignant. I found myself laughing out loud on the NYC subway,which got me a few looks from the other passengers. I figured that the book would be just one big laugh. I was wrong there was actually a part or two that got you all misty! Still the events of the book are so funny don't be surprised if you miss your stop on the train or stay up all night to finish the book. My favorite part was how Two-Down got the Lexus! Pure Genius! Just take my word for it and buy it. You will NOT be sorry.	2004-05-20

First of all I would like to say that this book splits it's time between following Prince Arutha on his quest for Silverhorn and Pug and his search for answers about the danger they face. As with the other books in the series the story grips you and the action is plenty. I would say that Arutha's quest for Silverthorn is almost like a side quest in terms of the whole plot. It does help to introduce new aspects of the plot and it also has young Jimmy the Hand in the spotlight. I like how his character is developing. I also hope that his relationship with the &quot;Upright Man&quot; is further explored in later books. The one main gripe I have is how easy this books' main bad-guy was dispatched. You are made to believe that he is much more powerfull then he turns out to be. Everything is always wrapped up in a neat package at the end. Would not be so bad to see a good guy get his head kicked in (Lyam????)from time to time. Having said that I ordered the 4th book in the series within hours of finishing this.	2004-05-14

That was true to some extent but the majority of the book was devoted to the trials. If you are a lawyer or someone who is interested in that sort of thing then this book is for you. If you want a good read then pick up the Capeci book on Gotti,that is top of the line! You can also read this if you are having problems sleeping....	2004-03-19

This is hands down a fantastic novel!!!Now that I got that out of the way let me give a bit more detail. the novel follows the travels of a team into the farthest reaches of the Amazon. They are going there to search for what might be a cure for cancer,as well as look for a lost member of a previous expedition. There is a race to fine this cure becuase there is a growing plauge spreading into the US that is linked to this discovery. There are all the elements that make up a good story.The action scenes are great and there is just enough science fiction added in to give it a little kick in the pants.I really enjoyed the story it moved along rather well (Which is perhaps the most important quality of a good book). The characters were well drawn out and you found yourself caring for them.I have alos read Subterranean by this author and found it just as enjoyable.Pick it up!!!!	2003-09-11

I have read all of his fiction work and for the most part rather enjoyed it. When I was done reading Red Rabbit I thought, ok for some reason he needed to tell that boring uneventful story. The next one would once again run the normal 1200+ pages and keep me reading late into the night. Well I ran out an picked this one up. It's a little over 400 pages. In most Clancy stories that's just the prologue. The idea for the story is a good one,the whole independent spy shop deal.  The problem is the characters,why must the main characters be related to Jack Ryan Sr.? There is no reason for them to be related.  It is about time you move away from Ryan and start something else. Nobody says you can't write the techno-thrillers,just not with Ryan. Also everyone is a genius,they are all super super smart people who turned down the millions they could have made to either work for the US government or the \\"Shop\\". Everyone is a PHD or CPA,even the security guard at the door is a ex-Special Forces operator. Another thing that has started to get on my nerves is the way everyone talks. If I have to hear \\"she's a doc\\" or \\"when I had a fighter plane strapped to my back\\" again I think I'm going to scream!!!Nobody talks like that. <BR>  Now having said that, I would like to say again that the idea of the book is pretty good and could be expanded into a few good tales (the 1200+ page kind).Also the information we are given about the Ryan Sr. story arc seemed rather interesting. Would have been nice to got into that a bit more. So in closing, please drop the Jack Jr. ... and move on............	2003-09-08

I like just about everyone else waitied on pins and needles until my copy of Harry#5 arrived. I could have finished it the day I was delivered. However I forced myself to take it slow to savor the book, it's anyones guess when Harry#6 will be available.I enjoyed the storyline for the most part. It was good to see that it was not business as usual for the cast of characters. It was also a change to see Harry acting more like a normal teenager for once. As always the author is able to spin a rather outstanding tale and captivate the reader. Now having said all that I would like to touch on why this is not a 5 star review. I would have liked a bit more in terms of surprises or plot twists. The author tried that at the end but it kind of fell flat for me. Also there was alot made of the death of a major character, not sure if I consider this charcter (I will NOT give it away!!!!)a major one. However don't think for a second that I will not pre-order Harry#6 the minute I am able to do so.  The best thing about this fantastic series is that it gets children to want to pick up a book and read. So don't wait,order it and ENJOY!!!!!	2003-06-27

I was not sorry that I did. The story overall is excellent,it keeps you reading from the first page. Lucas is a fantastic character and his dark side is especially enjoyable(We all like to see the main charcter kick butt as well as solve the crime and save the day). Sandford's writing is right up there with James Lee Burke.I think that the most important thing is that the story flows, it does not bog down.

Pre-ordered just to make sure.On the one hand I was happy to be reading another Ryan novel. The story moved along quite well and kept my interest.On the other hand it was short. Yes I know 600pgs pages is enough to choke an Elephant, yet I am used to 1000 plus pages. Usually Clancy needs at least 500 pages to ramp the story up and set the stage for some action. Here there is little if no action at all. The stoy has no surprises at all you know from the start all will go well. I had hoped for a bit more action in Moscow with Ed and MP. I realize that this review is not painting a nice picture. If you are a Clancy fan you need to read this,you might find as I have that it does not measure up to some of the previous masterpieces but worth the couple of days it would take to read	2002-08-21

I found them outstanding,they were a perfect fix while waiting for Clancy to put out a new offering. In fact I thought that this author was molding his own style and it was pretty darn good! However this one missed the mark. It started out slow and the pace just did not pick up. Yes the characters that I loved in the other boosk were here. I really did not like the idea of bringing the characters from two seperate story lines into one novel. I kept expecting action to break out but it never happened. I made it to page 266 before calling it quits. It has been sitting in my desk drawer for months. I hope the next novel picks up where the first two left off.	2002-07-09

Yes he has gone outside NYC before but this was just plain BAD. What makes this series so good are the cast of characters that complement the main character. Like Max the silent, the mole, the prof, etc etc etc. Without them it's just not the same. Yes I understand that Burke needed to leave NYC, does not mean I have to like it!

I think it lends the book an additonal layer of authenticity. I found myself concerned with the plight of Srg.Bass and his unit. My only gripe is that the real action was a bit later in the book and it was too quick for me. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the portion of the book about their training as well.

However I felt that this was not his best work.There was very little in the way of action, the bad guys did not do much of anything until the very end, and even then it was not much at all. It was mostly one sided,would of been nice to see a bit of action. We all know that Clancy is quite capable of that(Red Storn Rising for example). The worst part by far was the ending, what the heck was that with Ryan? This was a fairly big letdown from his previous book, Rainbow Six. I hope the next novel will have more of the Rainbow crew. Fans of Clancy will find this one to be a decent book, but will know that it is not one of his best.	2001-01-27
