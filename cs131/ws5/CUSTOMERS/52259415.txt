But, their incorrect and even slanderous accusations of reputable people and organisations due to their ignorance and bias of them is inexcusable. They further compound their errors by insisting on their ludicrous theory and ridiculing all others as the ultimate hypocricy.<BR>Picknett and Prince see conspiracies everywhere, and that the individuals, organisations and ideologies ridiculed in the book are because- &quot;..faceless behind-the-scenes manipulators have no compunction in seizing their ideas and twisting them for their <BR>own ends&quot; (pg374). Are they serious? All of history depicts machiavellian and unscrupulous characters twisting ideologies for their own ends. The Catholic religion being one example of ruthless men (and popes) distorting Christianity for the sake of crusades, witch-hunts. inquisitions, tyranny etc. So using Picknett and Prince's logic should we ridicule, defame or ban Christianity ? - I don't think so !<BR>Another illogical and ludicrous theory they propose is that the pyramids and sacred knowledge has been garnered by shamans taking hallucanegic drugs, and not from any lost civilizations or higher beings (which they continually disparage). Isn't their theory even more absurd and unfounded, not to mention dagerous- glorifying drugs to find esoteric answers ? Should we use their own convoluded logic, and accuse them of being drug-pushers ? <BR>This is very poor research and theory (not to mention book writing), as well as being compounded by their own paranoia and delusions. <BR>I hope people reading this book do not take Picknett and Prince ill-founded conclusions &amp; disparaging of benvolent people and organisations conclusions seriously, and only make use of the names of the people and organisations to find out the truth for themselves and in other more objective and fair books.	2001-12-07

Yoga means spiritual union with God (not performing exercise postures), and meditation is the single most important thing a person can do to attain peace, love &amp; advance themselves spiritually. This book describes in detail and clarity, the various techniques for concentration, visualization, meditation and contemplation (the stages of Yoga).
