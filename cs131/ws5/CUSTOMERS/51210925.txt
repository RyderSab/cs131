Palahniuk's story of anti-hero Victor Mancini is dark, twisted & hysterically funny.  That being said, not everyone will like this book.  Palahniuk is raw and at times obscene.  Choke is incredibly so.  I imagine a lot of people will be offended by some of the language in this book.  If you don't look through the words and into the minds of the characters, all you'll read is obscenities.  For example, some of Victor's sexual exploits are described in graphic detail.  However, I felt as though Palahniuk did an amazing job of removing all sexual excitement from the scenes and making them the emotionless exploits of a helpless addict.  I'd love to go further with this, but it may ruin some of the scenes for those who haven't read it yet.  If you're intrigued by dark, twisted humor with a touch of cultural commentary mixed in, (and if you're not offended by words alone) you'll love this book.	2005-07-06

But I have read a good amount and this is by far the best I've read from him.  I tore through it in about 2 days. <br /> <br />The basic plot was enough to keep me interested.  The sub-plots only made things that much more interesting.  The love story isn't overdone and fits nicely.  I also love the way Grisham makes no apologies for Rudy's seemingly unrealistic good fortune.  He's a likable kid who knows he isn't really worthy of being in the situation he's in.  Things have fallen into place for him and he knows it.  This story line could cause the reader to throw the book down screaming, \\"Oh come on!\\"  But Grisham makes sure this isn't the case. <br /> <br />The courtroom drama itself plays out in such a way that it never becomes boring.  One thing I don't like about some authors is that they often seem to think their reader is fascinated with the same technical details they are (e.g. Clancy and his endless descriptions of ships and guns and such).  Grishman interjects enough technical explanations of the legal system to explain things and keep it interesting.  He never once goes too far.  Through the 500+ pages of this book, I never once put it down because I was growing bored of it. <br /> <br />As a disclaimer, I haven't seen the movie.  I suspect the book is much better, but if you have seen it and already know what's coming next, it may ruin the book for you.	2004-08-31

Those Grisham fans who read this book looking for courtroom drama or suspense simply because it's Grisham were probably thoroughly disappointed.  Nevertheless, this book is a riot.<br />This is one of those, 'If it can go wrong, it will' types of stories that had me rolling.  I don't think Grisham intended this book to be considered a work of literature with deeply developed storylines.  It's satire and a lot of fun.  I think that's what he intended.  None of the characters in the story are deep or believable, but that's not the point.  They're not portraits.  They're caracatures.  The entire plot is contrived for humor's sake.  And it works.  Nobody watches &quot;The In-Laws&quot; because we think that the relationship between Peter Falk and Alan Arkin will have some great impact on our view of family.  Don't read &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; hoping to find some deep meaning in the holiday.	2004-06-08

I read some of his stuff, but I find that his books too often drown you in pages of technical details that have little or nothing to do with the actual plot.  I find that Clancy is one of the few authors I've read where I can honestly say the movies are often better than the books.  Without Remorse is free from most of these dry details though and that makes it a great book.  I think this is because there is simply so much going on that Clancy doesn't have time to fit those details anywhere.<br />This book is pretty unique for Clancy in that it explores the history of his recurring CIA character, John Clark (aka John Kelly).  The action and suspense in this book are, in my opinion, second to none when matched against anything else Clancy has written (or at least that I've read).  Clancy paints a great picture of a man with problems who falls for a woman with much bigger problems, all while trying to do his job for the CIA.  A must read, not for only Clancy fans, but for anyone who enjoys edge of your seat suspense.	2004-06-08

Coben weaves an incredible story through twists and turns that kept me turning pages.  I bought this book at a hotel gift shop on vacation thinking it might be something to read while I fell asleep in the sun.  No chance of that.  I couldn't have fallen asleep reading this even if I had wanted to.  It seems as if Coben throws in a new wrinkle on every other page and somehow they don't seem contrived.  I flew through the last 100 pages of this book only to find myself disappointed that it was done.  As much as I wanted to finish the book to catch my breath, I found myself terribly upset that the roller coaster ride was over.  Great book!	2004-06-08
US	51210925	R1SZNHSWPTMIRL	0440225701	454775948	The Street Lawyer	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Never really gets started	The opening scene, with 9 lawyers being taken hostage by a homeless man, starts out pretty intense.  But, like the whole book, this scene looses it's luster after a few pages.  The book just loses its intensity and becomes more of a waiting game.  Sure, you keep reading to find out what happens, but you never really buzz through the pages waiting to see what's next.  There just wasn't enough going on to really grab me.  The entire story could be told in less than 5 minutes and you wouldn't really miss much.<br />In addition, there wasn't much character development (which may be why I felt like things never really got started).  This can be a good thing in some cases, as too many fiction writers find it necessary to tell me how his character got beat up by a bully at age 9.  But in this case it lacks too much.  You never really know much about Michael Brock's failing marriage except that it's failing.  We know nothing about his wife and very little about Mordecai Green, his new partner.  As a result, the few storylines that are present come off forced.	2004-06-08

I understand that good fiction often requires a little suspension of reality.  But Darkness goes well beyond &quot;a little&quot; suspension of reality.  This book is unbelievable almost to the point of being funny.  I never really got sucked into the story.  In part, because although I was able to picture the faces and places, the almost cartoonish story line meant it never seemed real, even in my imagination.<br />That being said, this book isn't horrible.  It's average and that's about it.  I'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but can't.  There's a few twists.  Most are pretty easy to see coming, but I don't think Saul was really intending to blindside you with them anyway.  The end was a little disappointing, although I read worse.	2004-05-24

This was a terrifying book full of suspense and twists that kept me turning pages.  Unlike many suspense novels I've read, this book doesn't waste much time before it starts getting creepy.  Things happen early and often in this book.  And each time I was sure I had it figured out, Saul blindsided me with a new wrinkle.  Great book.

I'll grant that it keeps you turning pages early on.  But after a while the obsession with sex gets a little annoying.  Even if not his worst, it's certainly his most vulgar.  Additionally, this one wraps up in what I've found to be usual King fashion.  Far too quickly and with little of the suspense and fear that the story starts with.  As is often the case with his stuff, I found myself just wanting to get through the last 100 pages.  Just to get it over with.  It left me feeling cheated.	2004-03-08

That being said, I kept turing pages to see where it would end up.  I can't say this is a bad book, but it's not a great one either.

It's football.  How could it be bad?  Well it is.  It's actually rather boring.  A story simply doesn't work unless the reader feels some kind of emotion for the main character.  Whatever that emotion may be.  In this case, I simply didn't care what became of Neely Crenshaw.  His story never moved me to sympathy and, as he grew more pathetic throughout the book, by the end I was just glad it was over.  Short of one chapter in the middle where a group of former players sit around remembering the big championship game, this book is very dry.	2004-03-08
US	51210925	R27IIE9Y89OE3L	1881273423	547764097	The Love Languages of God	Books	2	82	88	N	N	Starts good, goes downhill	OK, when I first started reading this book, I enjoyed it.  And I thought I would really enjoy where it was going.  I actually recommended it to several friends (a recommendation I now regret).  That opinion changed rather quickly as the book continued on and on without much to say.    The book started off with Chapman briefly explaining why he thinks some of us feel more connected to God in certain ways (ie., study, worship, prayer, ...).  He argues that this is a result of each of us having a primary love language.  And consequently we relate to God best in our own language.  This was, in my opinion, a very promising insight.  It goes a long way in explaining why my wife and I have different responses to worship and service.  To her, service is a joy, worship is a duty.  To me, it's vice versa.  I think Chapman was on to something.    He then goes on, in the next five chapters, to show how God displays each of the five love languages.  These chapters, although not very insightful, do offer decent support for his original theory.  Unfortunately, however, the book could have ended right here.  Because after this, the next 5 or so chapters seem like one big promotion for Chapman's Five Love Languages book(s) and lecture series.    I also felt as though Chapman was searching for something significant to write about in these closing chapters.  He seems to have run out of material for his original thesis and now just begins writing about anything that relates to love.  Which reminds me, the chapter on discipline was very disappointing.  At one point Chapman actually suggests that a man lost his children as a judgement of God.  Now, I'm not going to debate God's sovereignty in all things nor suggest that God does not have the right over life and death.  But to claim that this man losing his children was judgement from God is a leap of faith I'm not going to take.    All in all, the book is poor, but not terrible.  If you keep in mind that Chapman is a psychologist and nota theologian, you may find some very helpful information here.  But don't expect any grand revelations concerning love or God in this book.	2003-02-03

I was very disappointed that Strobel didn't interview any skeptics. It seems he just assumed that his own questions were the most difficult to answer. He does quote from a number of skeptics concerning the issues at hand, but he never looks for counter points or allows for the skeptic to answer the evidence. And when presented the evidence, Strobel seems to succomb far too quickly for me to believe that he was truly a skeptic when he conducted these interviews (I know he was already a believer, but the book is written from the perspective that a skeptic is challenging scholars). I realize some of these chapters could have been entire books if Strobel challenged every point, but I would have liked to have seen him really debate some of these issues. As a Christian, I did find some very interesting information in this book. But, even so, I cannot ignore the blantly one-sidedness of this book.	2003-01-06

He has been compared to the likes of Francis Schaeffer and C.S. Lewis, but if this book is any indication of what went on in Chesterton's mind (and most say it is), Chesterton is a dime store version of Lewis at best.<br />The book begins by setting up a strange world and an even stranger mystery.  It evolves through multiple twists that will interest the reader and keep them turning pages.  However, the climax is extremely disappointing and I felt cheated. Although Chesterton builds a good amount of suspense throughout most of the book, the loose ends wrap up so quickly, and so strangely, that I was left scratching my head, asking myself what I missed.<br />I know that this book is more than a simple mystery.  It is a conservative commentary on society and religion.  But in my opinion, the book falls far short in that regard too.  Whatever deeply insightful message the book may have been trying to say gets lost in a haze plot twists.  And, although I understood the basic message of Chesterton's parable, I found it not very insightful, and far from being the best work on the subject.<br />I recommend anything by C.S. Lewis before this book.  Even the childrens books (The Chronicles of Narnia) are more enjoyable and have more to say than this book.	2002-07-08

Eldredge suggests that the primary problem with Christian men is a lack of passion and desire.  He suggests we are too \\"nice.\\"  This drive to be a \\"nice guy\\" keeps us from being who we really are, adventurers.  I think Eldredge states the problem very well and although this was a good start, Eldredge then goes way off the deep end.    It all starts when he gives an account of his son being picked on by a bully.  Eldredge's advice to his young son?  Punch the bully in the face.  He then quickly mentions Jesus' command to \\"turn the other cheek\\" but claims that the church has misunderstood this verse.  OK, I thought, maybe he's going somewhere with this.  I thought wrong.  Eldredge never again mentions this verse.  I guess he just assumes that we all will reinterpret the verse his way after reading his book.  I didn't.  I'm not saying I'm siding with or against Eldridge on this point, but I just wish he would have supported his statement.    The problems continue as Eldredge further drives home his main point.  He claims that deep within a man there is a good heart waiting to be let out.  Men are, somewhere deep down, adventurous and this desire is inherently good.  OK, but Eldredge states his point by boldly proclaiming that men have a \\"good heart.\\"  This borders on a complete rejection of the Christian doctrine of original sin.  Eldredge really lost me when suggested that \\"we are never told to crucify our hearts.\\"  True enough, but we are told that the \\"heart is wicked above all things.\\"  Again, I looked for some deeper support for his statement, some better understanding, but found none.    Later in the book, Eldredge lays out what he believes are the three primary enemies against a man's heart, namely the sinful nature, the world and its influences and the Evil One (Satan).  However, Eldredge never again mentions the sinful nature or the world as man's enemies.  Instead, hespends the next chapter developing his battle plan against the Evil One.  In this chapter, Eldredge blames Satan for everything from dizzy spells to traffic jams to supermarket tabloids.  Interestingly enough, although Eldredge indicated that the sinful nature is indeed one of man's enemies, in this chapter on the Evil One he repeatedly infers that most of man's inner lusts and sinful thoughts are actually placed into our minds by Satan.  I'm not sure then where our sinful nature would actually fit into the picture for Eldredge, and unfortunately, as I mentioned, he never develops this.  One again, Eldridge makes an intriguing statement (three primary enemies) with little to back it up or explain it.    In the end, this is just a bad book.  Eldredge never develops any of his arguments.  Also, there is just too much bad theology in this book to warrant more than one star.  I understand that Eldredge is a counselor and not a theologian, but that doesn't exempt him from presenting sound Christian theology in his arguments.  If men are hoping to get a better grasp on what it means to be a man and a Christian, I highly recommend Man in the Mirror by Patrick Morley instead of this book.	2002-05-17

I bought this book after hearing the story of Jim Elliot, Nate Saint and the other missionaries at a recent Steven Curtis Chapman concert. Much of Chapman's Declaration CD was inspired by this story and I cannot say enough how incredible a story it is. This alone would make the story very readable. However, I was surprised to see how effectively Elisabeth Elliot weaves together the historical facts, her own experiences and the journal entries of the missionaries to create a book that is far more than simply readable. She has effectively portrayed these five men as men with an enormous passion for God's glory. A passion that they lived and died for. This is a book worth reading, several times. It is filled with inspirational quotes from the journals of the missionaries. This book allegedly pushed many Christians into the mission field. After reading it, I can see why.	2002-03-27

This one is no exception.<br />The first part of the book is a basic explanation of the different philosophical worldviews infuencing America today.  This is really the best part of the book.  Sproul briefly, but clearly, explains the history behind worldviews like pragmatism, existentialism and so on.  He explains how these philosophies gained support and how they manifest themselves today.  He follows this with part two, which is his view of the Christian response to these worldviews.<br />Overall the book is good, but don't expect an education on the finer points of existentialism.	2002-01-15

In fact, the book speaks very little of reconstructionism specifically.  As doom-sayers continue to make claims about the end of the world being right around the corner, Chilton's defense of a bright future for the church is something we really need.	2002-01-04

These are questions that every Christian must ask themselves, again and again.  Certainty of our salvation is not just a nice thing to have, it is commanded.  Peter tells Christians to make our calling and election sure.  This is the entire purpose of Guthrie's book.    This book is not for the casual reader.  Guthrie labors hard to show the believer, and the unbeliever, his true state, and I suspect he expected the same type of intense labor from the reader.  Like many puritan writers, Guthrie's style is foreign to us today.  He writes logically and completely exhausts his subject.  The effect of this is that it allows the reader full certainty of the point the author was actually trying to make and it gives readers conclusive arguments for that point.  However, a secondary effect is that it requires the reader to study the work intently and to really examine the evidence and conclusions the author makes.    This book is worth every bit of effort.  Being sure of our salvation is not something to take lightly and an intense study of Guthrie's work will give the reader enormous insight into their own eternal condition.	2002-01-04

Although he doesn't get the kind of press that others like Lucado and Wilkinson do, his writing is vastly superior and far more Biblical.<br />The Holiness of God is full of eye-opening insights into the inconceivable holy nature of God and consequently our sinful state.  In a very practical way, Sproul provides mere glimpses (that's all we can really get anyway) of just how holy God is.  At the same time, he refuses to avoid the difficult topics (like suffering and evil) that many feel-good, politically-correct religionists do.  When we consider the awesomeness of God it will force us to look at ourselves and see exactly how far we are from Him.	2002-01-04

He's easy to read and even easier to understand and retain.  However this book falls just short of being a five-star book because Sproul, like all partial-preterists, fails to see his inconsistency in Matthew 16:27-28 and Danial 12:1-3.  If, as Sproul suggests, Matthew 16:27-28 speaks of the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, than what of the \\"reward\\" spoken of there?  Sproul never gives any conclusive reasons why I should believe that this \\"reward\\" is not the same as that spoken of in Revelation 22, and in fact all throughout the New Testament..  And if it is the same, then the partial-preterist fails in his efforts at consistency because he still puts all those other verses in our future.<br />In addition, Sproul never really addresses the relationship between Daniel 12:1-3 and the great tribulation of Matthew 24:21.  If the great tribulation occured in the first century, than I need to know why I should understand that Daniel 12:1-3, including the resurrection, did not.<br />All this being said, Sproul's honest look at escatology is a breathe of fresh air in a church consumed with \\"Left Behind\\" science fiction.  I only wish Sproul would have drawn his logical conclusions to their complete end.	2002-01-04

The local flood idea was around long before Hugh Ross.  Furthermore, it is not even the central theme of this book.  This book does a good job of proving the existence of a god.  Unfortunately is falls short of being an effective apologetic for the Christian God.  This is not a result of Ross' writing, but rather his approach.  Recent cosomological discoveries are certainly proving the existence of a creator, as Hawking now understands.  But even Hume understood a creator in the universe.  That didn't make him a Christan.

However, I was disappointed with the concept.  Why does Christianity continue to point fingers at the Devil and/or demons?<br />Lewis uses an interesting format (letters written from a ficitious demon named Screwtape to his aspiring nephew Wormwood) to convey an important message, namely temptation.  Christians must be very aware of temptations that confront them in everyday life, and Lewis does his usual, masterful job of inserting wit and humor into a very serious subject.  He provides many useful insights into temptation and often helps the Christian see why things are not always what they seem at first glance.<br />That being said, I'm frustrated with Christianity's repeatedly blaming Satan and his demons for our own sins.  The Bible teaches us that &quot;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.&quot;  Man is wicked enough on his own to fall head first into a horrendous life of sin.  We need no assistence from the evil one.  Maybe I'm reading too much into Lewis' work, but in today's church, when angels and demons seem all the rage, I think many may miss this message's true intent.	2002-01-03

The chapters alternate between historical details and letters to/from Love from prison.  Christopher Love was an amazing man whose love for Christ is truly seen and felt in the letters.  However, the chapters written by Kistler are often not very informative.  This may be a result of the lack of details in Love's story, but whatever the reason it does not make for very interesting reading.  The longest of Kistler's chapters is actually a very long-winded sermon from Love at his execution.  And despite Love's deeply rooted passion for Christ, even this chapter can be laborous to read, as Love repeatedly and emphatically claims his innocence.<br />The most interesting part of the book were chapters two and four, as Kistler speculates on Love's education.  This was an eye opening look at 17th century, Puritan England and the rigorous education the Puritans went through.  I had respect for the Puritans before, but these chapters grew that respect exponentially.<br />What also made the book worth the read was the last chapter, which is Thomas Manton's funeral sermon for Christopher Love.  In puritan tradition, Manton delivers a great sermon, focusing on a holy God and His just wrath.  Great stuff there and that makes the book an overall fair.	2002-01-03

In an era where Arminianism is passing itself as the true gospel among protestent denominations, Luther's work would provide enormous insight into the real message of the reformation.<br />Luther systematically exposits Scripture on his way to utterly destroying Erasmus' view of free will. He clearly shows that man is in bondage to sin and, without grace, cannot do anything but sin. In the process, he clearly defines the doctrine of total depravity and points to salvation by grace alone as the true gospel message.<br />It is a shame that most of today's evangelical Christians have no idea what battles were truly being waged during the reformation. I fear most evangelicals today, given their Arminian position on salvation, would have sided with Erasmus and Rome against Luther.	2002-01-03

Lewis' condemnation of public education's relativism is desperately needed is today's culture.  By condemning public education's abandonment of objective truth, Lewis clearly paints a picure of the world we will have as a result, specifically the world in which we live today.<br />Through a series of three essays Lewis shows that when we lose objective truth and force everything into subjectivity we effectively destory any basis for reason.  Right and wrong become illusions.  Ultimatly, we will destory ourselves from the inside out.  This speaks volumes about the current condition of our culture.  In a world were disagreement in considered oppression and anything that opposes my personal morality is considered politically incorrect, Lewis is &quot;a voice crying out in the wilderness.&quot;  How long will it take before we see that Lewis was right and our politically correct subjectivity will finally make us a people incapable of thinking anything at all?	2002-01-03

The thought is that the historical church has always taught from a young earth perspective.  The fact is that a large number of great figures in chuch history held vastly different ideas about the age of the earth and the six days of creation.  Ross' progressive creationism, or day-age theory, is not a new idea.  Most young earthers hear &quot;billion year old universe&quot; and immediately connect it to Darwinian evolution.  Hugh Ross is not proposing Darwinism.  In fact, his position adamantly opposes Darwinism and gives the Christian real, scientific evidence to discredit it.<br />Although I don't agree with everything that Hugh Ross teaches, I think we have to consider the possibility of the day-age theory.  In an evangelical world where Christians are called to deny all scientific knowledge of the age of the universe, Ross' treatment of the Genesis creation account is a refreshing look at how science does not oppose Biblical Christianity.	2001-08-03

And with modern-day revivalists promoting emotionalism, Edwards' work is as relevant today as it was when he wrote it some 250 years ago. Jonathan Edwards has been called the greatest evangelical mind in the history of North America. I think this work proves exactly that.	2001-03-12

Although, the content of this collection is probably worthy of 5 stars. Burroughs touches the Christian deep within his soul, displaying why, although many of us may claim the Name of Christ, the vast majority of us display something entirely different. Burroughs calls on Christians to reflect in our conversation (Puritan speak for &quot;lifestyle&quot;) that which we claim with our voices. This is a must read for every Christian.	2001-03-10

He presents salvation by grace with such compassion and love that I find it difficult to see how anyone could reject his plea to call upon the Name of Christ.  Although I was a Christian for some time before reading Spurgeon's work and although I already held to salvation by grace alone, I still found his work to be incredibly moving, both intellectually and emotionally.  Spurgeon is truly a champion of the faith and this may be his best work.	2001-03-10

Prayer is an outpouring of one's heart to God. Bunyan suffered persecution and imprisonment for this cause. His passion for the subject of prayer is obvious in this book. It's a passion I think all Christians could use a little more of.	2001-03-10
