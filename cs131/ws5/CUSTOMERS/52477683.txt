In fact, once I started it, I had trouble putting it down!<br /><br />There are a few factual errors that surprised me. Example- about a third of the way into the book, it is incorrectly stated that Ridley Scott directed the movie \\"Aliens\\". Strange because later on in the book the authors correctly state that James Cameron was the director. Ridley Scott directed the first movie, \\"Alien\\".<br /><br />The book also talks about Pixar being located in Emeryville California around the time Toy Story came out. In fact, Pixar was in Point Richmond and moved to Emeryville years later. Pointing out these errors might seem like nitpicking but since these errors are fairly simple to check on, it leads me to believe that there might be other factual errors throughout the book as well. In other words, you probably shouldn't believe everything you read in this book.<br /><br />That said, I still found this book a great read. If you are interested in business, technology and animation or want to gleen a window into the way Steve Jobs' mind operates, you should read this book.	2005-10-02

This book should be treated as a work of fiction.<br /><br />It's an interesting fantasy to think that the world is run by a \\"committee of 300\\" and I would even be willing to believe it (in fact I would like to believe it), but this author makes a bunch of bold claims without backing them up one bit. Not only that, but he doesn't even say what his own qualifications are and comes across in this writing as some sort of paranoid wacko.<br /><br />In this way, one cannot tell what information in this book is simply fabricated by the author and what information might indeed be true. So, one is instead forced to write it all off as fiction because none of the claims made in the book are backed up with facts or references at all.	2004-08-17

I'm sure the fact that Jeff Bridges starred in 2 of my all time favorite films; The Last Picture Show and The Big Lebowski, doesn't have much to do with my high recommendation for this book. For it is a great book in it's own right.<br />I'm a bit of a sucker for photography books, especially ones with black and white photos, and needless to say, I've bought more than my fair share. Some I have regretted buying, having only looked at them once or twice.  Pictures by Jeff Bridges  is one of the few books I don't regret spending money on. In fact, my purchase was totally guilt-free because Jeff Bridges is donating all the proceeds to a non profit organization.<br />But maybe I like this book so much because I am a photographer myself  and have worked in feature film production. In fact, one of the companies I have  worked for did the special effects for Starman.<br />That aside, Jeff Bridges offers a unique window of opportunity to gain a glimpse of what it's like on movie sets, from the point of view of one of the members of the cast. Stars like Penelope Cruz, Michelle Pfieffer and Gary Busey are featured.  Although members of the production crew are also featured, I wish they would be featured even more (as a member of 'the crew' myself, I often feel like our contributions are overshadowed by the celebrities).<br />Jeff Bridges' special perspective is not only represented in the subject matter of the photos, but also in the panoramic format. There is something cinematic about these wide shots and the format suits the subject matter of moviemaking wonderfully. Further, Bridges has some stories and hand written notes throughout the book, a very nice touch, entertaining and appreciated.<br />The book is nearly 200 pages, seems sturdy and is put together quite well. Whether you are a fan of Jeff Bridges, filmmaking, black and white, panoramic photography, or all of the above, this is a comprehensive book you won't regret buying. Heck, I've bought photo books that cost way more yet only include a handful of photos. Pictures by Jeff Bridges is definitely a book in which you get your money's worth.ay more yet only include a handful of photos.

After hearing good things about this book, I bought it, read it, and was quite disappointed. Deldotto does a lot of rambling where he could have made his points in a much more clear and concise way. There's a lot of filler here and I got the distinct impression that he was trying his hardest to make something that could have been a pamphlet, into a book.<br />For example, he outlines that a good way to get below market cost deals on consumer products is through government public auctions. Then later in the real estate section, he goes through the topic government public auctions all over again.<br />Deldotto's writing style is bland and after finishing this book, I had to ask myself, &quot;What did I learn?&quot; I thought about it for a while and couldn't really come up with much.<br />This book is a good try I suppose but it seems as if the author is trying to cash in on the popularity of what I call 'money-help' books by passing off a sophmore effort in the guise of some sort of ultimate bible.<br />You could and would do better with a different book.	2003-08-14

That said, &quot;Written in the West&quot; is an awesome companion to &quot;Once&quot;. It has a great interview in the front of the book but the 60+ photos are featured without further commentary other than titles and locations.<br />&quot;Once&quot; has more commentary on each photo or series of photos and has more photos altogether. This is why I prefer that book. However &quot;Once&quot; is a smaller book whereas &quot;Written in the West&quot; is more of a coffe table sized book.<br />The presentation is great and the color photos offer a unique perspective on the American west. Wenders even tells us what camera and lens he used and why.	2003-07-10

Books	5	86	91	N	Y	Great book for general business too, not just Real Estate	I would have to agree that this is a great no-nonsense book for anyone interested or involved in Real Estate to any degree. I would go further and recommend it for anyone interested in business in general. It has lots of useful and truthful information and you don't have to specifically be in the field of Real Estate to benefit from it. This book will let you know if Real Estate is for you, or that it is not for you. It will tell you what you can expect and what you will need to pay attention to in order to be successful.<br />Even if you are just a curious outsider, you will gleen some insight into the realities that Realtors and business people in general face. It's a book that is easy to read, formatted well, priced right and even entertaining. Equally beneficial for Realtors already in the busines, those studying for their license, people wanting to buy or sell a home, or lost unemployed souls like me who don't know what the heck to do to make money.	2003-05-17

It's really like a long brochure or outline rather than a book. While it did offer a few helpful points, it did not go enough in depth in expanding upon them.  After reading this book, I felt like I had read an outline or a proposal to a book rather than an actual book.  Thus, I regret my purchase of this book.	2003-05-12

Carducci not only provides some of the background reasons behind why you might be shy, but also some simple solutions to help you deal with it successfully going forward.<br />There are a few sections that did not pertain to me such as the shyness in your child section but I found the majority of this book helpful and informative even though it took me a while to get through the book.	2003-04-10

Thus, I suddenly find myself back in the job market and felt ill-prepared to deal with it until I got this book.<br />I went on a few interviews but had been nervous about certain questions such as; do I tell them how much I was making at my last job? Do I write a &quot;thank you for interviewing&quot; me letter after the interview? etc, etc...<br />This book covers all the topics that you are nervous about. Examples; what to say in a cover letter, interviewing, salary negotiations + much more.  Included are some useful sample resum&eacute;s and cover letters in different formats.<br />After reading this book, I feel much more confident that I'm handling my job hunting in a more professional manner. I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a job, or even if you have a job but hate your boss and want another one.<br />In general, I like the For Dummies clear and concise and easy to read format.

If what you want to learn are the steps to being able to develop and print your own black and white images, then only Part III of this book will be of interest to you. Parts I and II delve into the rudimentary basics of photography in general such as choosing a lens and camera, what medium and large format is, taking people pictures, etc..<br />In this sense, the book can be considered a basic introduction to photography in general. It is not specialized to black and white photography as the title implies. If you already have the basics of taking pictures and just want to learn the best methods to begin developing and printing your own black and white prints, skip this book. It will repeat a lot of what you already know.<br />However, if you are truly a beginner photographer and want a good overview, with some information on doing black and white photography thrown in, this book may be just the book for you.<br />I find the title misleading in that the sections on black and white photography are minimal in comparison to the sections on the basics of photography in general.	2002-11-16

Despite the high price, this is one of the best photography books I have ever purchased.<br />As a photographer myself, I can say that it is refreshing to see a book that delves into the stories behind the pictures (many which have been featured in National Geographic magazine) with both meaningful text as well as the display of surrounding photographs which led up to the final published one-the outtakes so to speak. Seeing these outtakes is enlightening. It provides a glimpse via examples, into Sam Abells working style and methods of seeing.<br />Abell proves himself a very generous and inspiring person. He shows an uncanny ability to not only make amazing photographs, but to also talk saliently and make clear statements about the process of making them too. Abell shares with us his thoughts, and stories for his photography. I'm not sure many other other photographers would be so willing to do so.<br />I found it interesting to learn and understand what went through Sam Abells mind while making photographs. Oftentimes one sees a photographer's results (the final images) yet knows nothing about the journey of work it took to actually achieve the results. This book fills that gap beautifully.<br />One can tell that this is a very personal book for Sam Abell. He does indeed live the photographic life, not only documenting important public places and events, but those of his own inner life as well.<br />The size of this book is quite hefty, perfect for a coffee table-it's that type of book. The production quality is top notch-the book text is easy to read and the images are presented beautifully.<br />My only complaint (and it's a small one), is that the ink on the front cover (the book is cloth bound) is not even and is faded and light in places. Again, this is minor and all the text throughout the inside of the book is perfect. Also, the book is a bit expensive.	2002-11-11

The non-fiction hints and tips are on all the left pages and a fiction novel is on all the right pages. I would have prefered the book be divided into 2 normally formatted sections.<br />The books content is surprisingly full of empty rhetoric. The fiction novel section just seemed to pander to the reader and insult my intelligence in too much of a 'touchy-feely' style, the non fiction section was quite lacking in real workable solutions. It mainly delved into psychological and religious pep talks, even quoting the bible on a few occaisions.<br />I'm basing my rating on the fact that this book is a lowest common denominator type book in that it assumes a low level of intelligence for the readers.	2002-11-06

You don't have to be a landscape photographer to enjoy this book.

This book serves as a great example of what you can do in the darkroom to bring out a more poignant image than you actually shot at the location. It should be required for anyone who works with black and white photography in the darkroom; not because you will gleen any certain tips or techiques but because you will study the final results and perhaps wonder how they were achieved.<br />As a photographer, this book will remain in my photo book collection and it is Kenna's strongest work to date.	2002-04-20

While the plight of Teller's parents is not unique among Americans who's formative years were spent around the time of the Great Depression, Teller's way of telling the story is.

I can recommend this book-brick sized, jam-packed with some 800 pages of mostly black and white (but some color) photographs on such things as street and travel photography, portraits and a few nudes.<br />It's interesting to witness the progression of Gibson's style since the 1960s, up to the late 90s. At first, he was more interested in photojournalism and took those kinds of shots-wider, more encompassing. Later, he became more interested in the abstract, usually singling out one subject/idea and getting very close in. I find it particularly interesting that the vast majority of his photos are shot vertically. This is Gibsons signature style and he does it quite well. And for a black and white photographer, his color stuff is sure great! All of this is in this book.<br />As to as the size of the book, I have no complaints. It's very think and feels sturdy so I feel like I got my money's worth. I have opened it up all the way, spreading the pages out nearly flat so that I can study the photographs better. Doing this creased the spine, but so what? I think the spine is supposed to be like that and the book has held up well, especially for the price paid. ... This book would make a neat gift for someone who is interested in photography and doesn't mind some bit of sexual content (ie. probably not for a child).	2001-08-10
US	52477683	RS45K4TJ94TRM	0821227386	305249032	Brassai : Paris By Night	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Into the night we lurk	Little, Brown and Company needs to do something about their quality control. This is the second book I have obtained that is published by them and has had a problem. My copy of this book had a tear near the binding, even though it was received brand new in the sealed wrap.  Another Little, Brown and Company title I purchased brand new, '2 Times Into' by Michael Stipe, began falling apart after only one reading!<br />The content of this book is great. It's a dark book as it should be, for it depicts the night. The photographs urge you to want to look deeper. In viewing these photographs, I long to hear the mysterious stories behind them, and the conditions under which they were taken.<br />Modern day high speed film did not exist back in the '30s, so I assume long exposures were used for many of the shots. Yet most images evoke a real slice of nightlife feel to them, rather than anything contrived or artificially set up.  Each photograph stands on it's own, and yet the entire compilation represented here equals more than the sum of it's parts.<br />There are only 60 some images represented here and the book is too expensive, but the presentation is appropriate to the subject matter and the book dimensions are suitable for good study.	2001-07-17

She admits that the pictues are posed so they often don't represent any sort of reality. And about 30% of them aren't even of her, but a of look-a-like!<br />Further, the photos are not of good quality. They were taken with a digital camera so what? That doesn't automatically make them salient to the present day or any more fitting than if they were taken with a film camera. In fact, a film camera using black and white would have probably yielded more emotionally raw pictures even when given the same content.<br />The bottom line is that there is very little cohesiveness to this book. I can't help but wonder what the author learned if anything. I don't get the impression that there was any catharsis for the author in the process of creating this book.<br />The book fails in that it's a lot of noise without saying anything. The author fails to imbue her readers with anything real learned or gained.....	2001-07-06
US	52477683	RZPALAOVXSL2N	078686060X	791542848	Images	Books	5	7	7	N	N	David Lynch as photographer	You know David Lynch as a movie director and possibly as a painter, but this book will open your eyes to Lynch as a photographer. Packed with mostly black and white (I like the black and whites best) and a few color images, this book includes photos by and about David Lynch projects.<br />It includes production stills from some of his movies, but more importantly, it includes images from his personal creative projects. My favorite collection in this book are his black and white &quot;Industrial&quot; photographs. I also love his &quot;Nudes and Smoke&quot; project. Both evoke a feeling of Film Noir, yet with an underlying beautiful darkness potential that only Lynch can attain. He also includes studies on things like dental hygiene and spark plugs. This is all very Lynchian stuff folks-and that's rockin' good news.<br />I would have personally preferred to see more personal projects and less of the movie stuff, but I guess the movie stuff is what sells.<br />If you are a Lynch fan, then you should buy this book. And if you are not one, chances are your interest will be sparked by this book and you may become one.	2001-07-04
US	52477683	RQNXKYYS17MU1	0316815721	39539675	Two Times Intro : On the Road With Patti Smith	Books	3	9	9	N	N	Michael Stipe's view revealed in black and white	This book includes not just black and white photographs shot by Michael Stipe while on the road with Patti Smith, but also many polaroid photos taken by Patti Smith's guitarist Oliver Ray. Oliver Ray's photographs are designated by a little &quot;O&quot; near his photos.<br />While Stipe certainly has some real gems here, he doesn't demonstrate complete mastery over his camera equipment, which to my knowledge was a Leica M6. Many of the images here are blurry and/or out of focus. But that is ok, it evokes a certain frantic 'on the road touring with a rock band' style.<br />Oliver Ray's Polaroids are on the other hand, wonderful. Taken with a cheap Polaroid Land Camera 100 (circa 1960s) using instant Polaroid 667 black and white 'peel-apart' film (which is still sold), Ray achieves stunning results especially when you understand the' limited featured' camera he worked with.  This book is an interesting study for anyone who is as fond of Polaroid photography as I am.<br />If you are an R.E.M. and Michael Stipe fan, or a Patti Smith fan,  then of course you will enjoy this book. However if you are seeking true pristine photographic works of art, look elsewhere. Most of these images evoke a more 'grunge' (for lack of a better word) feel.  There is some great prose by Stipe, Ray, and many others including Patti Smith. And, there are many famous people depicted including the likes of Allen Ginsberg.<br />One note about my copy of the book-after just one reading, the binding fell apart and the first quarter of the book fell apart into separate pages from the book. This was very dissappointing and should not have happend under normal reading...	2001-07-04

For me, it delves into what it's like to be a creative person in the 'normal' material world. You always feel like an outsider. I identify with this book myself and it is one of my favorites.  The book has all the elements of a good book in it, including sex.<br />Without giving any of the plot of the book away, I can say that McMurtry makes some compelling, touching and prolific statements about what it feels like to operate on the fringe, as an observer. What do you hold onto in life as important? What do you let go of?  What indeed...	2001-06-29

It's an easy read, and presented in an interview question and answer style.<br />If you are a Lynch fan, you will enjoy this book which covers Lynch's history and some if his thought processes. Lynch realizes that his art should (and does) speak for itself so he keeps his ground and never talks about exactly what he meant in a particular shot in a film. Instead, he talks about the evoking of feelings and ideas as the genesis for his art.<br />I would certainly recommend this book as a more entertaining read than the competing texts, some of which are nearly ridiculus in their over-intellectualiztion.	2001-06-29

Don't let yourself be programmed by the consumeristic media about what success is.<br />Zig Ziglar delves into this issue by making the point that success doesn't just mean being successful in one area of your life, like in your career. True success comes from living a well rounded life and being successful in all areas of your life from family and personal relationships, to self image to money and career. I believe that this is a good overall approach to take and I found the book interesting and informative on this front.<br />I personally believe that people often take success too seriously. Self help is ok, but just don't get all bent out of shape about it.  Do what you love to do and be the best person that you can be in life. Success is not an event, but a continuing process. Ziglar makes this point in the book as well.<br />The one annoyance I have with this book is that the author uses religion to make some of his points. I am not religious in the traditional sense of the word, and felt that he could have made the same points without alienating people by bringing religion into it.	2001-06-27

Out of all of the personal financial books I've read, this one is probably the best. I was originally turned to author Eric Tyson by a friend of mine who informed me that all of his books are great.  And they are! [He's written several in addition to this one; Investing For Dummies, Mutual Funds For Dummies, Home Buying For Dummies, Taxes For Dummies, etc.]<br />Tyson has a very no nonsense and sensible approach. His books are easy to read and understand and they are packed with useful information that will help you save money and make your money work for you without risking it all on something risky or wasteful.<br />I'm going to go back and periodically re-read this book so that I can develop money habits that last me a lifetime.<br />This is a great book for anyone who would like to be rich, and recognizes the consumerism programming that modern day media forces down our throats. It reiterates common sense viewpoints about the handling of money that everyone should be aware of.	2001-06-27

It  reiterates common sense viewpoints about the handling of money that you probably already know, but just need to be reminded of.<br />The book is an entertaining read and not too 'heady'. Although it is not a how-to book, nor does it provide any specific 'do this' ways to gain and hold onto more of your money, you will find yourself contemplating your money and making more of the 'right' decisions about it.<br />Read this book, live long and prosper!	2001-06-24

If you are into photojournalistic photography, then you have undoubtedly heard of Magnum. This book is for you if you care about Magnum and are interested in seeing the work of prominent Magnum photographers and reading a bit about the history of Magnum and photography in general.<br />The book is quite big and heavy. This makes it great to display on a coffee table and to view the powerful photographs, but not so easy to read the 3 essays. Also, the book only covers up to the mid to late 80's. It should be updated to include the Magnum photographers of the 90s. That said, it's is still packed with important and inspiring work.	2001-06-23

If you are at all interested in documentary photography/photojournalism, then you will not be able to put this book down!<br />It is jam-packed with a collection of personal essays by the worlds most prominent documentary photographers. They speak about why and how they do what they do, their path in life and their experiences seeing the world up close and personal.<br />The book has at least one black and white image example per photographer, but it's not a coffee table photography book. It's a relatively small size and can be carried with you in a bag quite easily.<br />I'm going to go back and read this book again. It is full of reasonings and inspirations and as a published photographer, it makes me want to grab my Leica and hit the streets with some black and white film...	2001-06-23

It delves into the Tao mindset; how to co-exist living life to it's fullest and also photographing without discrimination. It's great in that it get's you thinking about not just the way(s) that you take pictures, but also perhaps why you do so.<br />It is filled with great black and white photographs by some of the greats such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Weston, in addition to the author's own photographic examples. The book is a relatively short and easy read and the photographs take up many of the pages.<br />1. The size of it is like a coffee table book but paperback. Since there is a lot of text to read, it can be a bit uncomfortable to read (but great to look at the pictures).<br />2. There isn't really much direct photographic, picture-taking techniques discussed. The book more makes parallels between the Tao philosophies and applies them to photography, but it doesn't outline enough photographic examples of this.<br />In all, it is a good book however dwells too much on the purely Tao teachings, without providing enough relevant direct examples to photographic techniques and practices.<br />It did however aid in changing my view of photography and the way in which I photograph now with a very observant, open mind. I did that before, but this book helped remind me to keep on doing it.	2001-06-22

If you find this style annoying as I do, you may have a difficult time with the book.<br />While the book is an interesting read, I was a bit dissappointed and unfufilled. I was hoping for a nice message about life and how to live it, yet didn't even get hardly much of a conclusion at all. The book is full of tangents (perhaps that's the point) and seems to dwell on all of the tiny minutia of every single thought that might go on in one's mind while on their lunch break.<br />It's certainly a 'different' kind of novel, however it left me cold.	2001-04-09
