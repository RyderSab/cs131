US	52351823	R2A92DF9HKUROV	0553587501	894969734	Hammered	Books	5	9	14	N	N	Excellent, captures the feeling well	Sometimes, when you read dark science fiction, you feel like there's a disjoint between the world and the characaters in that world.  In Hammered, the characters fit well into the world.<br /><br />You get the sense they grew up there, they belong there and they'll probably die there.<br /><br />Along the way, they'll help tell a compelling story that, unlike Goldilocks, is just right.  Not too much detail, not too little.  Not to fast or slow.  Not too long or short.<br /><br />A tale that has you turning the pages because you want to see what happens to the characters next.  And Bear does not disappoint with what the characters do, not even to the end.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-01-11

I was, unfortunately, gravely disappointed.  It reads like Douglas Adams on acid, only not quite as coherent.  The other book that jumps to mind is sections of the Illuminatus Trilogy, without the conspiracy.<br />Overall, I just didn't see the point.  Neat ideas, I guess, funny in a strange sort of way, but not enough of either or a sensible storyline or plot or concept behind it to make it worth struggling through to find the interesting parts.<br />I suspect I'm just a bit too linear to like this.  Which isn't to say it's bad, I just don't like it.	2001-05-30
US	52351823	R2R5KHR2BXC23N	0441003702	548875680	Schismatrix Plus (Complete Shapers-Mechanists Universe)	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Excellent	Those readers of the old school cyberpunk, back from the early to mid 80s will probably know Sterling's work, and his mechanist/shaper series.  Schismatrix is an extended set of stories (really) stitched together that detail the journey of one man past humanity to whatever the next level is.  Good vision, solid writing and fun to read.<br />Also thrown in is a collection of follow-on stories set in the machanist/shaper world, that build on the history outlined in the previous novels.  Again, more of the same good writing.<br />Basically the writings are a cyberpunk sort of future that details the next set of developments for man.  There are two paths and two warring factions.  The shapers - who work inside the gene code - and the mechanists - who use machines to enhance man.  Each of these viewpoints of life break further down into factions that have differing views of how to go about it, as well as interests, directions and futures.<br />The world itself is a bustling one beyond the earth but inside the solar system.  The science is all plausable with minimal hyper-whatsits and weird science.  Well recommended to any fan of the cyberpunk genre.	2001-05-30

This is one of those books that really sheds some insight into the mind of the phone phreakers and the 'hacker' subculture.  Kids, bored, learn everything there is to know about the phone system, social engineering, and various other things.<br />Because they are young, they do cool sutff with their knowledge, and because the world doesn't have much of a sense of humor, they get into trouble.<br />A very interesting read about the people who would be Internet Consultants and web designers today, but didn't have the material to work with at the time.  Proto-web as it were.  If you ever wondered about what the online world looked like before it was the web, read this book.  It's great fun.	2001-05-30

The book that came out of it was a very interesting look at what life after the war could be like.  It embodies the tension of the 50s and a very different lifestyle.  Readers today will find it interesting for the study of the different social dynamics and culture.  Plus, it is a well written story that provides interesting insight into how things could have been and, of course, the ironic ending.<br />Well worth the time it takes to read.	2001-05-30

Sorry, but the spoilers are minimal.<br />2 - Cover tradeskills.<br />I'm a fanitical tradeskiller, and I had to print out a chunk of a website to get the information I needed for the recipies.<br />Outside of that, There are a few things I keep by my computer for EQ.  This book, my tradeskill manual (printed from a website) and paer for notes.  This book is great for finding your way around a new city.  Just got gated to Commonlands and need to find the Freeport Bank?  Open to cities of Antonica.<br />Thinking about starting a new character?  Check out the race and class combinations to get a feel for the advantages and disadvantages or each.<br />The book has the final advantage that it is a hardcopy.  Unless you have two monitors and two computers, there are times you need to look up something quickly without camping.  This book is perfect for this.<br />Eventually you outgrow the information, that is you will need to take notes and pester people or visit a site, but you never fully outgrow it.  No matter how much you play there is always a use for the information in this book.<br />And of course,the information is not completely accurate.  That's one of the things that makes Everquest fun.  Caveat Emptor!  No reference guide is a substitute for doing it yourself.	2001-05-30

The only downisdes, such as they were, was the the book as a whole was just a bit too light for my taste.  Lisane seems to be a typical teen aged sort of person, with roughly typical teen sort of problems - most people aren't destined by birth to rule and don't have to worry about their race being enslaved by interstellar pirates.<br />Most of the ending of the book seems very rushed.  The beginning and mid points flow well, then suddenly everything happens and gets quickly wrapped up.  There are a dozen hints in the end of the book that could be further developed without cluttering the ending of the story unnecessarily.<br />But overall the book is certainly not a typical fantay novel, and is certainly worth reading.	2001-05-04
US	52351823	R1WO7145W4TIJT	0553576399	15854629	Distraction	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	Fun to read	Bruce Sterling is a fairly interesting writer.  His vision of the future is well-thought out and he's got somewhat of a decent track record in seeing where things are going.<br />The downside to his writing is that he often seizes on a phrase and beats it into the ground.  In this book, 'doable' and 'krewe' suffer from over over use.<br />The last problem is inherent in the vision of the future.  The world keeps moving faster and fractionating and everyone becomes more and more self  aware of their movement in the media flow, so that eventually life turns into a disjointed series of fragments of events that are analyzed and spun into the ground.  Which certainly is a plausible vision of the future, but it's not terribly fun for me to read.  I take that back.  It is fun to read, but not for 600-some pages and not with no goal that the story is building toward, just random noodling about the future.<br />If this was a short story or a shorter novel it would be much more enjoyable.  But it's still pretty good.	2001-05-04

The lessons and questions are those that you need to answer before you go into the business.  Interestingly, the release date for the book is about when the NASDAQ started its nosedive, and now most of the people who started a business to make money are out of the game or close to it.<br />The ones who actually understand what they want to do that's not get rich are still in the game.  Reading this novel will help you to understand why you want to get into the game and if you should.  Then again, it's really easy to miss the point reading this book.  While the riddle part is pretty simple, the answer is not.<br />As the Taoists say, those who know require no explanation, those who do not know can accept none.  If this book doesn't make sense to you, you might not get what you want out of the small business lifestyle.<br />I certainly liked it.	2001-05-04

This is a novel for the old school Gibson fans.  While it does suffer from chapters that run 3-5 pages and cut from scene to scene, the novel inspires thinking.<br />Just as Neuromancer started cyberpunk, putting a new set of memes into the collective consciousness, this novel created a new set of thoughts for me.  I'm not sure exactly what it all means, but I'm thinking about it.<br />Best recommendation I can give a book.	2001-01-30

It seems to meander in various directions, and I never once got the hang of what exactly was going on, or what was supposed to be going on - if anything.<br />It also suffered from a fault that many futuristic novels have.  It seems that references to past events stop about the present time, and go back from there.  Few novelist bother to fill in enough backstory for references to the past after the novel was published.  It's a minor thing, but it can annoy me at times.<br />It had the elements of an interesting story, but I couldn't put it together well enough to enjoy the novel.  If this is your sort of novel, you'll like this one well enough.  It isn't mine, so I didn't.	2001-01-28
US	52351823	R3OKB2QD6JSMFH	0312868375	519499668	Patterns	Books	5	6	7	N	Y	Fun to read	I don't mean fun in the normal sense of fun, of course.  Theses are not what anyone would call fun stories by any stretch of the imagination.<br />They resemble the works of Bradbury or Dan Simmons.  Normal everyday events, somehow out of kilter a bit, or taking that half step behind the everyday to show... something else.<br />Not quite as brooding as Simmons, and not quite as adjective happy as Bradbury.  Somewhere in the middle.<br />Overall, well worth reading, but they don't seem to fit in any particular genre.  A little like this, a little like that.  Horror maybe.  But they're much too subtle to be horror.  At least the conventional kind of everyday horror.	2001-01-28
US	52351823	R1C395AYRLPBHQ	0671721658	422948219	The Mind Pool	Books	2	7	11	N	Y	Uncertain voice	This book seemed to be a reprise of Golden age science fiction, in a world where technology is the saviour of all, people are ethical, honest, hard working, updated with a dash of cyberpunk mentality, with hard edges, drugs, lies and the accompanying details.<br />Unfortunately, the visions did not meld well, leaving the story as a mishmash of ideas, with various sub-plots spawning off in various directions, and seemingly never wrapping up properly.  In addition, I don't feel that sufficient detail is given to the elements of the story to make them believable.  There are too many glossed over details to draw the reader in properly.<br />The main plot (at least it seems the main plot) itself represents an interesting idea - the mind pool - but it is lost in the noise.<br />Nevertheless, it is a somewhat interesting story, and a unique vision.  It's just very hard to read.	2001-01-21

In April 1999, it might seem obvious that the New economy was here to stay, and you either got with the program, or were left in the dust.  Here in January 2001, alas, the old world is back and the new economy is left battered, with 2000 being one of the worst years for the market as suddenly the discovery was made that even if you were making a new world, it had to be paid for.<br />Which isn't to say that Blur is an invalid book.  The world did really change in the last few years.  It just didn't change as fast as the authors of the book would like.  The current market has the old economy picking what it likes from the wreckage of the new, and implementing the fundamental changes of the new into itself.  Of course, a few titans have risen and shrugged off the drop - well enough to survive anyway - and will soon take their place as stalwarts of the market.<br />I'd recommend reading this book, subtracting some of the enthusiasism and applying the lessons as you see fit.<br />It seems certain to me that counting on a company to take care of you for a career is a bad idea, and people will be balancing work at home and home at work for the forseeable future.<br />I think the concept of everyone doing an IPO for the futurized earnings potential is a bit too visionary.  David Bowie has established himself.  Most other people haven't.  The concept, though, of why one might invest in the aggregate of the careers of a group of people (buying stock in a company, that is), while not investing individuals in an interesting one to think about.  At a guess, it's a balance of risk and knowledge.<br />There are many other things that are worth thinking about in this novel.  Just remember that the economic environment that spawned it took a hard downturn, which doesn't invalidate the vision, but reality can dothat.	2001-01-21
US	52351823	R3NMDIEEJQVNGH	0886779049	321390679	Changing Vision (Web Shifters)	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	Acceptable	While I liked the predecessor to this book, I found this one hard to read.  On a gross level, the various pieces of a good story were there.  There were interesting characters, well developed background and a well-developed plot.<br />Unfortunately, this book tends to be somewhat disjointed, with what I find to be unnecessary amounts of tension in the various threads that make it up.  Items that could be resolved are dragged out in excruciating detail as the various characters viewpoints don't permit the obvious resolution.  Which is ok, since most problems in life aren't easily solvable, but some of the items could be left unresolved, instead of contortions being made to wrap everything up neatly, despite the fact that a neat wrap-up isn't really possible.<br />The last disappointment was in the villians.  I tend to find narrow-minded fanatics as villians a bit of a disservice.  Creating a compelling villian that is interesting enough to be plausible while not dominating the scene is difficult in the best of times.  Somehow the quality of the opposition didn't seem to rate effort the victories required.  Or, didn't seem to merit the victories.  Villians overcome by an obvious and silly fatal flaw just aren't good villians.<br />That being said, the book is still worth reading.  It's just not a book that excites me.	2001-01-21

It's also about learning that you were really a jerk as a teenager.  Which is what elevates this up somewhat from a typical fantasy novel into the realm of the truly interesting.<br />The characters are convincing and human, as is the world and the various structures that hang it together.  There is a certain suspension of disbelief required to make the story work, but it's not a terribly painful one.<br />The only potential downside is that the book seems a bit long in places.  Overall, I liked it quite a bit and would recommend without hesitation.	2001-01-11

This is, unfortunately, the image that I got into my head while reading and couldn't shake it.<br />While it roughly true, the novel is much better than that.  Unlike _Silence_, the characters are not quite as super-powered, and much more multi-dimensional.<br />While the economics that cause most of the jobs to be really bad is never explained (a B student is at best a janitor at the Institute for the Criminally Insane?  Grade inflation must get worse in the future), Siggy is an interesting character.<br />The plot and flow of the book is a bit disjointed as it skips around time - in more than one sense - but overall it's interesting to read, and Siggy is certainly an interesting character as she seems to have a knack for getting into all sorts of weird trouble, and somehow making it out the other end in ways that are still believable.  The author does that well, without resorting to Deus Ex Machina.<br />I'll be looking for other novels by this author.	2001-01-06

The beginning is set up describing the extreme power that can be brought to bear on an individual by a corporation that becomes interested in them.<br />After a string of bad luck (engineered by an interstellar corporation) Thiadora Murphy overcomes all (including the same corporation that had her helpless months ago) to change the Universe.<br />Once you achieve the suspension of disbelief - or maybe this is the sort of story that interests you - it's a fun story.  There is an interesting discussion of 'floater' (purely space born) culture with its own set of taboos, rituals and everything you'd need to describe a culture and make it compelling.<br />The book has the giants of physics made into Gods, and the science has the same sort of feel to it.  Very space opera in nature.<br />Nevertheless, it was a fun book to read.  The character of Thiadora also developed in interesting ways.  A bit heavy-handed, but still quite interesting. <br />Overall, well worth reading.	2001-01-06
US	52351823	R3CGNW08YEF46L	0441006329	251318464	The Color of Distance	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Interesting Twist	Normally, alien contact stories deal with aliens that are much more advanced, or much less advanced.  In a certain sense of consideration, the Tendu are both.<br />While the author is advancing and has a certain political sensibility, this does not detract from the story in any meaningful way.<br />Overall, the interactions between the races - at least Juna and the Tendu - are fairly interesting.  The others humans, as portrayed, are a bit too shallow and stereotypical to be truly interesting, and the story probably been better off without the last pages that describe the politics and maneuvering that accompany alien contact.<br />There are several interesting ideas that are left undeveloped, but that's not a bad thing.  They would have distracted from the main focus of the story.<br />Overall, the book is well worth reading, with the caveat that it is very obviously leftist and pro-environmental.  A modern version of _The sheep look up_ in a sense.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but worth noting.<br />It will be interesting to see how the book ages, as the political sensibilities that shaped it change.  Check back in a dozen or two years.	2000-12-31

Overall, it's a format that suits Sterling quite well.  I've read his novels, and they don't seem to be quite all there.  It's the short stories that he really shines.<br />All of his interesting sensibilities are there, and he has evolved to new concepts as time goes on and the future we expected changed.  The Japanese mega-corp - a staple of early science fiction - is dead.  Bruce was ahead of the curve in viewing Russia as an interesting place to do cyberpunk.  Certainly as history unfolds, it remains an interesting place.<br />Lastly, the evolution of the writing is good.  It maintains the cyberpunk view of the world, undergoing some few modifications for the Internet as it came out, not envisioned, as well as the toys that make cyberpunk fun.  Bio Drills that eat sugar, not eating and living on implanted fat for days.  The whole Urban spider concept is a fun one that needs to be explored more.<br />Overall, a must read for the old-school cyberpunk fan.  Heck, it's a must read in general.	2000-12-31

The writing was convoluted, seemingly for its own sake at times, and it never built toward an ending.  It seemed, rather, to meander in exacting description of just how bad everything is.<br />The last 40 pages or so wrapped the plot together by revealing a lot of off screen action that made for a 'happy' ending.  While the reader is struggling to understand the significace of McNihil's eyes, and why it is they are mentioned every 10 pages or so, McNihil is solving everything, without having the decency to let the reader know what the Hell it is that he's doing!  <br />It was, however, rather disappointing to wade through the baroque writing of the first few hundred pages and find it to be nothing more than scene setting.  Not plot development.  Scene setting.<br />Sure, the characterizations are interesting, and yes, the world is somewhat dark.  Wasn't worth the build up.	2000-12-28

There's not a lot of technical detail, just exposition about the major players and how they went about things.  Well worth reading for the reading interested in a deeper understanding of how the Internet got started.<br />It also clears up the myth about how the Internet was designed to facilitate communications after a nuclear war.  It wasn't.  So read this book and understand where the myth came from.	2000-12-28

Tired of reading tired knowledge passed off as far reaching vision because the author happened to be in the right place and made a pile of money?<br />This is the book for you.  Robert Cringley has no reason to be nice to anyone since (1) he writes a column on the dirt of the industry and (2) his name is a pseudonym.<br />So, the gloves are off, and no holds are barred.<br />Of course, there are a few of Cringely's laws, and some of those tired bits of vision (broadband.  It's the next big thing, as of 1996.  Spitting distance to 2001 and I'm still waiting!).<br />The addendum to the 1996 edition is interesting, since it's less predictive than the 1992 edition.  Sometime between 1996 and the present, things changed in ways that no one expected, and the predictions are rather amusing.  In 1992, looking at the 'new' 486s and looking at the future, the vision is true.<br />If you want to see someone analyze everyone's personality defects, in depth, this is the book for you.  If not, there's plenty else to read.<br />I'd recommend this work.	2000-12-16

Post-apocalypse, a new government has built up around the few survivors of the 'Great White'.  We are introduced to Elspeth, a Misfit with unknown powers.  She has a destiny to fill, and overcomes obstacles to understand it, her powers, and fufill it.<br />The joy, however, is in the reading.  The characters are interesting at all times, more than one dimensional, and well thought out.  The plot, such as it is, serves more as a mechanism to study the interactions of the characters and the  growing understanding of the characters as they develop.<br />The society that forms after the Great White is an interesting one. Things are left unclear, but that is the way of it.<br />The book neither delves too deeply into detail and interaction, nor leaves things that need to be said unsaid.  It is a quick fun read, and of interest to anyone who wants to understand what it's like to discover that something you thought about yourself that was unique isn't, and there are others like you.<br />Worth the time it takes to read, and it won't be long, because it reads quickly.	2000-12-16

It's like the horror movie where you know there's something behind the door, and the actor opens the door anyway, and there is in fact something bad there.<br />Irene, who looks nothing like her picture on the front cover, runs the risk of sucking.  She's determined to the point of stupidity.  It would be easy to make a story that sucked from that trait.  She's determined, she overcomes obstacles, she wins.  Bleah.<br />This does not happen.  The story runs along the edge of making that happen but, thankfully, avoids it.<br />It is instead an interesting story that talks about culture, and stress.  The lesson about the price for winning is, unfortunately, lost in the actual story where the protagonist wins - with minimal cost.  Heck, let's be honest.  All she loses is a negative character trait as she grows.<br />The story is still well worth reading, for the in-depth development of a culture, a 'realistic' look at other world settlement, and interesting aliens.  The most interesting aliens are off-stage, but that's life.<br />I read this book quickly, and the back story filled in quickly enough not to leave me clueless, but was drawn out in a parallel thread that stretched throughout the story.  Nicely done.	2000-12-13

This is a fairly rare gifts, where alien cultures are too alien.<br />The ending of the story itself does leave a lot to the imagination, but I don't think this is a bad thing as such.  The contrast between the two parts is remarkable, and shows a fair amount of talent to be able to make the transition from a story of a warrior to the spiritual journey that is the second part.<br />Overall, well worth reading, should the prose be something you can deal with.	2000-12-05

You'd expect a bit more of a politicial thriller.<br />Fortunately, this is a rocking action novel.  The type is a bit bigger than normal, so you can easily zip through this book.  The fact that it is clearly written, and flows well from event to event only heightens the speed.<br />The downside is that reading as quickly as I did, I sometimes got a bit confused on which faction was in favor of what.  Luckily, the alliances were straightforward enough, until they weren't.  And I had sorted out the main factions by then.<br />The only downside, if this is a downside, is that the main character is obsessed with female breasts.  Not that this is a bad thing, but having a detailed analysis of that feature of each female character for the first 50 or so pages did begin to wear.  Luckily, by that point, things were happening, so it became a non-topic until the denoument.<br />It seems that some of the other reviewers were not taking into account the perspective of the novel while reading.  While the political infighting seems minor next to the threat to humanity from the Enamorati Compact, no one outside of a half dozen characters fully understands the threat, and so it does not influence their actions.  This is actually a plus to the novel, as agendas are advanced in ignorance.  Only the reader can understand how the big picture fits together - and that knowledge is incomplete.<br />Of course, as befits a good action novel, the good guys win, the bad guys get beaten for being stupid and lose to boot.  Girl beds boy and all are happy.<br />Obviously, this is not a novel that plumbs deep intellectual depths.  It is suprisingly well thought out for a &quot;simple action novel&quot;, and represents some of the best entertaining science fiction that one can read.<br />Enough fluff for entertainment, and enough meat for thinking.  A good balance,and a book and author destined for my must read chart.	2000-12-02

The author takes a flair for creating interesting alien races, and applies it to a story that flows very well, from beginning to end.<br />You should add this book to your collection. I could say more, but I won't.	2000-11-28

This fact is important for two reasons:<br />1 - He writes clearly and well.<br />2 - While living in the Internet Gold Rush, he took notes on the details of conversations, instead of the meaning (or so he tells us).<br />So, this book is another interesting view in the ways and means of money.  Smart money, dumb money, no money for tomorrow's payroll and all that.<br />It's not written to give glamorous insight into how the author is a brilliant visionary, sharing his ideas with you, or anything that you'd find in a typical business book.  It's a detailed narrative about life in the trenches.  It certainly seems true enough to me.<br />For that reason, it's worth reading, since most books push an agenda of their own, and this book doesn't really seem to have an agenda or something to prove.  From the internal evidence, the author has tried to write a fun, compelling story that might sell, in order to make some money.<br />He succeeded.  At least, the writing of a story worth reading.  I have no idea about the money.	2000-11-28

Which doesn't mean that it's that bad, it's just not as good as the other novels in the series.  Spider loses his edge.  He goes around doing good deeds, and generally being pushed around by the people he hates the most.  After the manic whirlwind of first three novels, it makes for disappointing reading.<br />The story focus in a peripheral manner on the election, but since Spider has been removed from the streets by fame, he's too far away to really get at the heart of it.<br />Lastly, the artwork seems to have taken a turn for the cartoony.  It's a lot more '4 color' than previous efforts and just doesn't fit with the world of Spider Jerusalem as previously depicited.<br />The most interesting thread focuses on the relationship of Channon and Yelena.  Which is, while interesting, not what I buy Transmetropolitan for.<br />Overall, if you liked the first three novels, this is still worth reading.  If the first three novels were too offensive, you might find this one tolerable, but since so much of it is built on the first three, it's not that good a story in its own right.	2000-11-26

If you think that you might be offended - not easily, just offended - I'd dteer way clear of this book.  I can't really describe any of the scenes in here and stay PG-13, but I'll try.<br />Spider Jerusalem has decided that he will investigate religion to write a column.  That being done, he takes enough drugs not to sleep for three days, dresses himself in a toga (complete with motel logo from the stolen sheets), a tinfoil halo and a fake beard.  Leaving his apartment, he decides to jump on a car  ranting and raving about how religion is a crutch for the weak minded.  His assistant boils his comments down (out of his hearing) thusly: &quot;Take more breaths or just repeat 'I've taken lots of big red pills'.&quot; (that's a sanitized paraphrase).  If you're not sure if that's offensive or not, it gets worse.<br />If you think that's funny, buy this book.  It's a drug-soaked high-speed trip through a world gone crazy in the future.  There are a few touching moments.  For example, what happens when all the people that had themselves frozen in the past are raised in a future where cancer is cured and all that fun stuff.  Think on the changes from 10 years ago to now, multiply by a large number.  So what does society do with these visitors from the past?  The answer is fairly interesting.  In more than one way.<br />The artwork is beginning to hit its pace in this novel.  Channon's (Spider's assistant and ex-stripper) face goes from a middle aged jowled version to a younger one, but I never liked how she came out.  Her body is, of course, trim the whole time.  That's comics for you.  Spider's teeth have settled down and his broken tooth seems to gain a fixed location and is always there.<br />Overall, if this won't offend you, you are going to have to read it.  Now.	2000-11-26

It represents the first three comics in the Transmetropolitan series, and it takes us from a peaceful mountain to a squalid city, with great loss of hair.<br />Spider Jerusalem is a reporter of the future.  The future is not the greatest future in the world, but that's about what we expected.  Things haven't changed much, with people remaining people despite the neverending careening forward of technology.  And Spider understands people and government.  How they work and what they do.  In his own words, a journalist is a gun with one bullet.  Aimed correctly, it can blow the kneecap off the world.<br />Which is what he proceeds to do.<br />Before embarking on this series though, a warning is in order.  This is not for the easily offended.  Or even the occasionally offended.  You need a cynical view of the world and thick skin to read Transmetropolitan.  The fact that people are cloned, less brains, and sold to Long Pig restaurants shouldn't give you a shiver.  Wanton drug use shouldn't bother you - not in the sense of condoning it, but in the sense that you need to be able to accept is as a part of the story without letting it distract.<br />If you can read this, you'll love it.  If your world view just isn't that cynical, run, don't walk, away from this series.	2000-11-26

After that, he went to his mountain.  But he was called back, and in Lust for Life, wrapped his fingers around the pulse of the city.  Now, it's election time again, and his editor has spoken.  Spider will cover the election, since his readers demand it.  Not a threat, but advice for someone who wants to make money for himself and Spider.<br />You might think that a comic book is for teenagers.  Maybe even younger.  Some might be.  This is not one of them.  Spider is a drug crazed maniac.  But he's not the worst of the lot.<br />The politicians are.  Heller, with his &quot;America for Americans&quot;  catchphrase, and a Hitler lookalike in the crowd - in case you missed the point with the Gothic lettering of his name and having his rallies compared to Nuremberg, it's driven home is a rather unsubtle manner.<br />The Smiler is just plain deranged.  It's not clear if politicians look like that before they've been prepared by their handlers, but the scary thing is I don't find it implausible.<br />Vita is an interesting character, a nice addition to the cast of maniacs that populate this world.  The story line flows well, and demands several re-readings to see all the details that the first reading misses.<br />The artwork in this novel is simply at its best.  Yelena is a character that Darick Robertson is meant to draw, and he does the things he does well, well here.  No experimentation, no compromises.<br />This is easily the best of the series, and makes &quot;The New Scum&quot; all the more disappointing as a follow-up.<br />Absolute must read.	2000-11-26

Normally, I but ten or so books at a time, and re-order when the stack gets low.  I mention this, not because you care, but because it explains, somewhat, why I wasn't sure if I was reading a real account or life in the Valley, or a fictionalized one.  I actually thought it was real for a while.<br />What finally cinched it for me was when Omega was mentioned as a significant company that made chips.  OK.  So this is fiction.  In that case, the fact that certain things happened became obvious before they happened.  The ending was still a surprise.<br />Most of the reviewers seem to think that the characters depicted are a little too strage to be true to life.  Having worked with that sort of person, I didn't find them all that implausible.  You'll certainly find people that are a lot stranger wandering around technology companies.<br />The interesting thing is that the author 'got it'.  His explanation of what made an ironman what he is was almost dead on the money.  It's actually not brainpower that separates one from the others.  It's just that certain quantity that lets some people just do things while others don't.  Tiny is a perfect example.  He just figures things out and the others don't.<br />The cross and double cross that was happening in the background until it reached the front at the end was a nice touch.  The fact that our fearless heroes were uninterested and clueless about money was another heartwarming touch.  Since this was a fictional account, an ending that was a bit too contrived and neat can be forgiven.<br />Lastly, I found the whole relationship thing to be amusing to say the least.  Not that the salesguy gets the girl.  Though that was amusing.  But the fact that it was just so awkward and unnatural - for the characters.  I just had to smile inside at watching it.  Again, it was another touch that might have seemed a bit strange for the reader of most fiction, but was pretty true to life as I've seen life.<br />Either way, this book was absolutely fascinating, and a must read for anyone that might have to work with technical people who just plain can't understand them.  Why they are the way they are is all in the book.  You might not believe it, but it's roughly true.  Except for the psychological warfare that Benoit plays.  That didn't sit quite right.	2000-11-16

Of course, there are drugs and other fun stuff, a network of computers that are hacked, and large corporations.<br />Hardwired is different in that it is a much better action story, with the main characters being a street samurai and a panzer driver.  Gives the book a much different focus than Neuromancer with a decker as a main character.<br />And the world is much more alive.  Dirtboys and mudgirls are moving, struggling, alive in glorious MOTION.<br />It's a book that you can immerse yourself in for the hours it takes to read it, blink, stagger outside, and look around at the world, disappointed, because it's not the right world.  Somehow, the world of Hardwired is so compelling that you forget for a while our world.<br />That's about as high a recommendation as a book can get.	2000-11-12

Darwin days, a time of hyper-evolution, where the weak die, from plate glass windows dropped from skyscraper and worse, forms the backdrop of the urban chaos that is the heart of any good cyberpunk novel.<br />What do you get when you take a young gang member out of France, put him in rigorous training of both the body and the mind in Zen without the morality, and then drop him in the middle of a war that goes bad?<br />You get the Whirlwind.  And the voice of the Whirlwind calls to our hero across death, across 15 years of lost memory, across cultures.<br />Because those who sow the Wind will reap the Whirlwind, our hero is caught up in the events of a past life (his), that tears apart the current life he is trying to build.<br />As the reader and our hero uncover the mystery of his past life, the story builds to an inevitable conclusion.<br />We learn philosophy, and the trap of only getting selected pieces of philosophy.  We learn what one must do to survive.<br />And we enjoy the book immensely.	2000-11-12

As has been stated, Sira spent most of her time being pushed from place to place, with little to no control over her situation, or understanding of how or why she might control it.  Her amnesia, rather than drawing the reader in, hindered the story's development, leaving the reader with a sense of lurching along like a drunk leaving a bar with no sense of where they might end up, nor a sense of which way to take the next step.<br />When she finally obtained control, it was much too late in the book.  The denoument left me rather disappointed.  Sira Morgan had spent the bulk of the book being built up as a shell that would be discarded.  When that shell was discarded, the book ended in a single page, with no sense of what had been hinted at all throughout the book.<br />And all the events, deep and subtle, that led up to the climax were uncovered much too quickly, and then left hanging with the end of the book.  It was a neat explanation, but one that was done too quickly to satisfy.  Any number of analogies unsuitable for publication here suggest themselves to mind.  The reader is left to fill these in with their inagination.<br />While the book worked on a number of fronts, that is the story was compelling, the cultures described were sufficiently different to cause an interest in seeing more and the characters interesting, the execution itself was rather disjointed and disappointing.<br />The author certainly seems to have the potential to tell a good story.  This is not it though.	2000-11-12

Check.<br />Good ending? Check.<br />The author resists the impulse to make the story too heavy-handed, and the characters are idealists that don't always suceed just because the plot demands that the good guys win.  Although the good guys win, and man and woman are together, and the plot of the bad guys is foiled.<br />But along the way, we see that the characters are fallable.  Not in that annoying anti-hero sort of way - that manages to triumph against all odds.  In the way that you and I are fallable.  In a way that sometimes, we overcome our failures and rise above them.<br />To look at the review, it would seem to be another story about another set of people that has a happy ending.  While this is certainly true, I find that I lack the words to explain why I read this story as quickly as I could.  Perhaps because it is balanced.  Trying to put it into words makes the story seem weaker than it is.<br />Perhaps it is the simplicity that is appealing.  A simple story about a man that overcomes his weakness.  A man that crawls out of a bottle and makes something of his life.  Perhaps not too plausible, perhaps a bit to neat and happy an ending, but certainly one that I read toward, and enjoyed.<br />And that's all one really needs to say about a book.<br />Buy it!	2000-11-11
US	52351823	R3TYVI24FRQSED	0553580167	34846573	Gemini Man	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Different point of view	Having just read a set of biological thrillers, I came into this novel with a different perspective from the other reviewers.  I was expecting more of a discussion of the science, and less focus on the events and actions.<br />From my perspective, it was a thoroughly enjoyable novel, because it did some different things from a standard novel.<br />It was scientific enough to stand as a novel in that genre, yet there was enough action to make it a thriller in its own right - a bit of a dull one, admittedly.  Having read about another of the author's works on the back cover, I discovered I should have been reading it as a action novel, not a scientific one.  That I could make that mistake all through the novel should say something about the quality of thought that went into it.<br />It would have been all to easy to write a story of how Newman escaped and ran amuck until he was tracked down by a team of brilliant forensic psychologists (something like _Red Dragon_).  The author chose to write another story, and in doing so, made it more interesting.<br />The thing that interested me the most was the sliding viewpoint.  We are introduced to what appear to be the central characters in the beginning of the novel, yet when all is said and done, some of the central characters are repudiated.<br />This alone makes the book a step away from the formula, and as such, fairly interesting.<br />Walking halfway between scientific thriller and action, yet with some thought and a lack of formula, this book is worth picking up and reading.  Not just because it will make you wonder if our government would really do something like that (they probably would), but because it will make you wonder why more authors can't break away from formula to write novels that are this original - in certain senses.	2000-11-04

Was this because there was lots of action, or many plot twists to be told?<br />No.<br />It seems so thin because the book is a very deep, insightful look at some of the fundamental issues of life.  Certainly, science is science, and there is much to explore.  When, though, there is a world to explore by oneself, when science makes anything that is interesting to have, what is it that is worth having?<br />Original thought of course.<br />The culture of the survivors is interesting, and while it could be an easy throwaway, it is instead illuminating of values, and how they are shaped by the environment.<br />Biology runs amuck, but when all is said and done, it is randomness that sets some above the other.  Not randomness in the sense of sloppy thought, but luck.  Perversity if you will.<br />That is the true gift of life, where some rise above, and others remain mired on the bottom.<br />And this small homily is illustrated in a story where there is action enough, and alien (human and otherwise) races and alien thoughts (ditto).  Not to mention an interesting world, and the story of the struggle to survive in it.<br />Read this book.	2000-11-04

Certainly along with Vinge (True Names), this book predicts the rise of the Internet, but there is another prediction in there that people don't seem to be paying attention to.<br />The Plug-in lifestyle.<br />Corporations as a game, and not a source of all that is good.  People leave and change companies and towns as easily as... you and I do today.  Remember when switching jobs wasn't regarded as a smart career move and a chance at promotion?<br />It's easy to forget that even as recently as the 80's (ack.  It's not recent to me, but it is in certain senses) the corporation was a place to spend life and retire with a pension and a gold watch.  Since then, the concept of a pension is foreign to most of us, as is life-long employment.  The early 90's took care of that.<br />The 50's and 60's were the time of the &quot;organization man&quot;, not one who could or would switch places or jobs easily, and easily meld in with the newest grouping.  It's a shallow lifestyle, but how many people do you know that are experienced at it.  After Chainsaw Al (among others), how many people owe loyalty to a company?<br />A far-reaching vision.  The book is worth reading to see how true it has become in certain senses.  Predicting the future is a hit or miss proposition.  This book is a solid hit.  At least for me - in the Internet/Information Technology industry.	2000-11-04

A not-quite-man with rights and responsibilities, as well as a dragon that should never have lived.<br />Well, I don't have a dragon of my own, nor a hold of my own, but I understood how Jaxom felt as he tried to find his own path in a world where people thought they knew what was best for him.<br />Of course, he does heroic things, and even gets the girl in the end - though I bet he'll have a lot more than he reckons on his hands, as we all discover sooner or later.<br />He even manages to establish for himself a measure of respect that comes with being a full adult, and not a half adult.<br />A nice book, and certainly much more pleasant to read than _Catcher in the Rye_ as a coming of age book.<br />Plus, it'd be really cool to think about having your own dragon.  You could just fly off, and *blink*, you were wherever you wanted to be.<br />I know I wanted one.	2000-11-04

It certainly is illustrative of ecological thinking in the early 70's, but sort of misses out on some of the later developments in though since then.<br />Most important is the concept of Strange Attractors from chaos theory.  All of chaos theory in fact.<br />That is to say, conditions tend to stay near equilibrium, unless there are serious perturbations.  Brunner assumes a exponential decay, with the events of the book representing the steep edge of the curve.<br />History show us that linear decay isn't going to happen.  Things will get better and worse, but things tend to stay on track.<br />Of course, we have taken steps to prevent the events depicted from coming about.  It's not clear if they are sufficient, but I expect that the equilibium that man and the world have will hold - at least long enough for me to die peacefully.<br />Does this mean we should ignore the fears in the book?  Of course not.  While it seems silly in light of current events, it is worth reading to maintain a sense of perspective on how things could be, should we not exhibit care.<br />Consider the Iron Triangle in Eastern Europe.  50 years of the worst treatment imaginable, yet life goes on, perhaps even better than that depicted in _The Sheep Look Up_.<br />But what of the book?  Why is my review a lengthly discussion of ecology?<br />Well, the book exists as a vehicle for pushing the apocalyptic view of ecology popular in the 70s.  No more, no less.  I find it amusing to read given the state of thought in these matters, and insightful into the hysteria of the era.	2000-11-04

First thing, I wouldn't touch this book with a 10 foot pole if you are even a little bit inclined to be offended by blasphemy.<br />Second, if you don't smoke, try not to be smug.  Everyone dies in the end.  Except Constantine.<br />Third, if you do smoke, be very careful reading this book.  It just might make you quit.<br />So, what happens if you are the most intimidating magician of an age, a hard living man whose friends are about to die from the abuse that they've heaped on themselves - if they haven't died from associating with you anyway.  <br />Heaven won't have you, and Hell wants you entirely too much.  One of them is going to get you soon, unless you find a way to cure lung cancer.<br />And what if, after saying good-bye to everyone, you live.  Someone with a rep like Constantine can't make amends with his friends then live with reputation intact. (OK, so it's a spoiler, but given that this is the second of 6 or 7 Hellblazer graphics, I don't think I'm giving much away)<br />Great book.

The book is fascinating, tying in the fields of biology and anthropolgy in what can only be termed a biological thriller.<br />It draws the reader in, and weaves a compelling story, with an open, but still satisfying ending.<br />There is certainly science, but it accessible science, and doesn't seem terribly impossible.  Perhaps it could even be probable.  Our knowledge of this area is thin at best.<br />The down side:  The story never reaches a true climax, but instead seems to flounder after being drawn down from the larger picture to the story of two individuals.  While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it does make the ending seem to drag on a bit before the resolution.<br />Overall, if you are the sort of person who likes scientific hunt and chase, along with politics and people caught in between both, you'll like this book.  It will certainly not disappoint.	2000-11-02

The Amber Rulebook spawned a legion - small but rabid - of players of the game, and Shadow Knight was eagerly purchased by said players.<br />As one of those players, I cannot help but be disappointed by the book.  It's not because I don't like the source material (the 2nd chronicles), but it's because the book is just disappointing.<br />It's too little, too late.  Anyone who is a serious Amber gamer already had their own rules and variants worked out, and the sourcebook doesn't seem to really be above them.  I find it a lot worse in fact.<br />It's useful for the odd idea about adding to the game of Amber, but only buy it if you're a junkie who has to have everything on the topic.	2000-11-02

After all, roughly one Internet user in 10 is an AOL user.<br />And they did crush CompuServ, as well as buy Netscape (the mind boggles).<br />So, I read the book.  I have to admit, I still don't understand AOL especially well, but the book itself is absolutely fascinating.<br />It focuses on the old history of AOL, and the bits where CompuServ and Netscape run under the juggernaut are a mere footnote to the history proper, which delves deeply into the detail of how things started and zig-zagged from there.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who is even remotely interested in the Internet.	2000-10-24

Beautiful woman, forced to work for crime syndicate because they hold her brother hostage meets convict hacker recruited (and saved from a long jail term) by law enforcement agency.  They fall in love and...<br />I don't know what happens next.  I just could not finish this book.  Actually having to slog through the tedious detail just proved too much for me.<br />The book seems to be written in support of a RPG, and there is a lot of detail from the game that is introduced enough to confuse you.  Luckily, it's not central to the book.  Except there's enough of it to really detract and make you wonder what exactly *is* central to the book.<br />And the story and characters just don't cut it.  Nothing I can put my finger on, but I found myself completely disinterested in what happens to them.  The story itself is easy enough to flesh out and make the characters more than shallow stereotypes, but it never seems to happen.  The author is trying to pack a lot of background into the story, while keeping it moving and just doesn't succeed.<br />These things happen.<br />It reminds me of the first Shadowrun trilogy.  I guess I'm more impatient than I was in those days.  Or, as someone who has never seen the game system, just not that interested in the story for its own merit (or lack thereof).	2000-10-15
US	52351823	RLYYI4V74UDU1	0553262505	826884658	A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Simple, but not	Before I start, I should explain what I mean by high fantasy.  High fantasy is (to me) a writing style that does not concern itself with the mundane details.  Good is good and evil is evil.  People don't worry about where the next meal comes from, and death and disease are not immediate, except as the story needs them.<br />That being said, in some ways, A Wizard of Earthsea is a very simple book.  It's straight high fantasy, and it's a coming of age story about confronting your inner demons, and the price paid for the sin of pride.<br />And in an age where staggering complexity seems to be the norm, with plot twists and complex hurried action, sometimes it is good to sit and read a simple story, well told.<br />Perhaps it's a personal thing of mine.  So many people feel that it is necessary to do something new and exciting, the novel seems to exist to be novel and nothing else.  I find great pleasure in seeing people do the simple things well.  It's a lot harder than you think.  Witness how few do it well.<br />The fact that Earthsea is a seemingly simple novel, but complete in its simplicity makes it a classic in the field.  Other novels build on the base, or change it, but this is a book you must read to understand the root of how high fantasy is written.	2000-10-14
US	52351823	R1STKD4JGFX0VO	0312263619	327539499	Netscape Time: The Making of the Billion-Dollar Start-Up That Took on Microsoft	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good read, except...	The title neglected to tack onto the end &quot;and lost&quot;.<br />An otherwise good book is, to me, lowered by the constant complaining about Microsoft's tactics.  I'm not defending those tactics, or saying that the tactics were legal, nice or anything like that, but it just got a bit monotonous listening to them.  Of course, it's understandable how Clark could be angry about what happened, but it still makes the book less pleasant to read, trying to find 10 pages without a shot at Microsoft.<br />Clark is a good writer.  The story of how Netscape started is an interesting one.  It's one that I've read in one form or another a few times, so that part of the book wasn't that exciting.<br />There were two parts of the book I found interesting and make the book well worth reading:<br />1 - Jim Barksdale - the right stuff (chapter 12).  Jim Clark is a man who knows what kind of a leader he is, and knows what kind of leader is needed when.  Picking Jim Barksdale to be CEO of Netscape was a smart thing, and took a lot of guts.  I'd recommend a close reading of this chapter for anyone who thinks they might want to be a leader someday.<br />2 - The best of enemies (chapter 18).  It starts off with the Greeks who beat the Italians in World War 2, and in the process, attracted the attention of the Germans, who flattened them.  There is an obvoius lesson there (eventually you lose - Rome was sacked), and Clark adds the non-obvious one: Eventually you will fight a battle you lose.  But can you afford to avoid that battle?<br />So, the book has useful thoughts on leadership and business, interesting insights into the world of funding and Venture Capital and the birth of the Internet as most of us know it.<br />Read it.	2000-10-13
US	52351823	R2WDWFML11ZA71	0441003508	193313348	The Trinity Vector	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Typical Steve Perry	Steve Perry writes books that are fairly open about sex.  The details - such as they are - hardly titillate, but there are certainly details.  A lot of that depends on your point of view I guess.  If I was younger, I'd find the material to be somewhat racy.  Of course, the world the younger me lived in was different, but I digress.<br />There is also a strong martial component to his books. I actually prefer the Matador trilogy, because shooting people doesn't make for interesting reading to me.<br />The Trinity vector seems to be more of a story in search of a plot to make it work than anything else.<br />The story is about two people who have loved and lost, and find love again.  It's not that bad a story, all things considered.<br />The book doesn't really fit conveniently into any category.  The hero is much to sensitive for a good action novel, but some of the characters are much to... Policitally Incorrect for a novel with a sensitive hero.  Actually, they are portrayed with more depth than the equivalent character would be in a true New Age novel, and aren't really made out to be the monsters that a shallower treatment would make them out to be.<br />Sure, the ending disappoints, except, it's not about the silver box.  Once I understood that, it made a lot more sense.<br />So, what then is this book exactly?  Well, for me, it was enjoyable to read.  The characters were complex enough tp be interesting, without causing a lot of deep thought about what it all meant.  The story read well enough to draw you in, without tripping over itself trying to please.  It's just a good, solid, well-crafted story.  Nothing ground breaking or earth shattering.<br />A good afternoon's entertainment, any time (my afternoon was a gloomy one in October, yours can be different).	2000-10-09
US	52351823	RH8O96XQKH9PA	0930289234	777411096	Watchmen	Books	5	8	8	N	N	What's the stigma with comics?	I mean, it's just ink on paper, just like a book, right?<br />Actually, it's much more than a book could ever be.  A picture is worth a thousand words, to quote the old saw, but only the right picture.  Watchmen is full of those right pictures.  To me, the most powerful image is when Rorschach encounters his younger self and understands.  The frame that shows his understanding is my favorite image.  It's worthless without the context, but priceless with it.<br />I understand why people feel there is a stigma associated with the comic as a medium.  People who might look down on the medium have obviously never read Watchmen.  People who have read Watchmen and still look down on the medium as a whole are probably take themselves a little bit too seriously.<br />The book offers a compelling alternate history.  Not only the large historical events, but the smaller ones mesh in.  The world is displayed in the history that is created, with the details in place.<br />In addition, there is a wealth of reference to other works, which is explained sufficiently to not lose the reader, or not central to the story.<br />Lastly, there is a commentary on the comic as a medium, wrapped around a story within the story as a whole.  The comic embedded in Watchmen is a powerful comic in and of it's own right, but pales next to the scope of Watchmen.<br />Many levels to read and enjoy, no matter what your interest.<br />Of course, as an Alan Moore story, it features amusing synchronicity between the background dialogue (TV, cutovers between scenes, etc.) and the main action, and a dark alternate future.<br />Reading in this day and age it is, of course, somewhat dated, as has been pointed out.  The Russians aren't exactly a military threat any more, nulclear war isn't something expected soon.  But human condition is human condition.  If Adrian can learn from Alexander, certainly we can appreciate things from the perspective of 15 years ago.<br />Lastly, Watchmen offers some of the best one-liners and short quotes you can find anywhere.<br />And Rorschach.  Insane, right-wing vigilante (lest you think it's a priori negative, he's the only one who escapes with his morals intact - although how you read it depends on how you view life - that is, are his morals worth keeping intact?), I find his journey from Kovacs to Rorschach to be fascinating, and the reasoning behind how he became Rorschach is an interesting insight into the human condition.<br />Actually, the book is so grey on so many things, it's really hard to characterize it as having a particular political agenda.  None of the characters are all good, and all bad.  Given the anti-war stance, it would probably be viewed as leftist.  I think it goes beyond simple politics in its treatment of those things.<br />Rorschach tells us, &quot;You don't understand. I'm not locked in here with you.  You're locked in here with me.&quot;  It's just as true of the reader as it is of his audience there in the book.<br />Another favorite of mine: &quot;Those sure were good times.  Whatever happened to them?&quot; &quot;You quit.&quot;<br />That's Rorschach.<br />As some of the final dialogue goes, &quot;I won in the end, didn't I.&quot; &quot;In the end?  Nothing ever ends.&quot;<br />Yet Watchmen does indeed end.  Which is good, because you won't be able to sleep until it does.	2000-10-02
US	52351823	R38ECMIKBBQUS7	0553580272	737842842	House Atreides (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	2	8	10	N	N	Almost failed to disappoint	I picked up the book, and got about what I expected.  Certainly, it is not reasonable to expect anyone to be Frank Herbert, and trying to write in the Dune universe is a daunting task.<br />So I accepted that the characters weren't as subtle, the plans within plans ad infinitum weren't there, and there was more fluff that made the book while as long as a Dune offering, just not as satisfying.  On the upside, the borderline pretentious posing and glee at one's own subtlety was missing as well.  That could grate at times.<br />And the epic events depicted somehow just weren't as epic.  A hollow shell, without the abliity to draw in.  Perhaps it was the overt displays, the way most things were on the surface, rather than hinted at in a well turned sentence.<br />Consider:  In Dune, the Duke and Jessica hardly seemed to display and tension between themselves (as there are hardly any discussions between themselves), but by secondary discussions and inference, the tension is just as strong as if pages of prose had been devoted to building it.<br />The whole thing was &quot;Dune lite&quot;, as it were.<br />There were contradictions, from the death of the Old Duke, to the stretch for Elrood's chaumurky death and Baron Harkonnen being thin to start with.  I'd discuss, but it would be too much of a spoiler.<br />Then, as I was nearing the end, ready to go and write a passing review, I found something I could not countenance.  Someone being appointed &quot;Spice Production Czar.&quot;<br />That little slip, three words in a 700 page book, just turned me off.  Yet at the same time, in crystallized everything that nagged at the back of my head on reading.	2000-10-01

It wanders, and just doesn't get anythig interesting done.  None of the sweep and scope that you expect from Gaiman.<br />The world itself is not terribly cohesive either.  It seems part Daredevil, but it isn't really.  It's certainly not Sandman, or anything like that.<br />It's just a story.  Worth buying, perhaps, for completeness sake.<br />Hardly worth reading.	2000-09-30

Is Conroy a simple agent with his thatch of white hair, or a dude with the meanest mouth you ever saw?  Both.<br />Does this book wander off into some seriously weird voodoo?  You bet.<br />Is it still stylish in that 80s noir sort of way, with yuppies expanding to the ultimate form, Japanese ruling over all with mega-corporations, and the poor just plain poor.  You bet.<br />There's even hot cyberdecks, drugs and rogue biotechnology, for the cyberpunk purist.<br />The later exercises of Gibson take the same form, and repeat to triteness.  This book, being an experiment, is still fresh and interesting.<br />If it blows you away, keep reading Gibson.  If it's not exactly thrilling, there are many other authors to sample.  But give it a read and see what you think.  The time will be well spent.	2000-09-30

Not only do they make Neuromancer a lot more comprehensible, but they are good short stories in their own right.<br />From gritty noir type stories to the more happy, each explores a part of the human condition.  Although some, like Chrome, hardly aspire to human condition.<br />Why is it some people just fit in?  You don't want to know what Gibson thinks.<br />What happens to someone who is alive before the art they can create is creatable?  Or - what would Picasso's home page look like, if you prefer to reverse the question.<br />And if you take away someone's reason to live, can you take their place.<br />Plus there is, as always, monoclonal antibodies, drugs, the hot research scientists who create them and the Edge.  The people who live around the Edge.<br />It's filled with delightful images: &quot;Teeth so straight they could be used as a credit reference.&quot;<br />It's little pieces of Gibson's world, put out like a jigsaw puzzle, that Neuromancer assembles.	2000-09-30

I cursed and finished it anyway.<br />Swooping ultra-tech, meshed with Zen riddles.  It seems to make progress toward its goal, filling in without meandering, and read fairly quickly and cleanly - compelling, but not in a powerfully compelling way.<br />There is certainly science in there, and reading the back cover shows that the author has a MS in Chemical Physics.  Having studied in that field for a time, I can appreciate some of the things that are discussed.  It seems to be written well enough to be accessible to the layperson as well.<br />That the ending has elements of Deus Ex Machina can hardly be suprising, given the levels of technology.<br />That the characters are human, without being perfect or perfectly annoying makes this well worth reading.  It is truely hard to find characters that having more than one dimension without being carictures of themselves.<br />Sometimes you just want to give the hero a swift kick, but you never feel like he's responding to the situation in a way that is implausible.  The author doesn't even fall into the trap of having the Hero whine endlessly about how hard his life is.  I'll happily file it in my collection, and tag it for a later re-reading.<br />I expect I'll enjoy it then too.	2000-09-29
US	52351823	R1O0EXGIC8CFSO	0886771986	169918572	In Conquest Born	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Read this book	Looking through the reviews, it seems like many people find the main characters - I hesitate to tag either with protagonist or antagonist - to be immoral, vicious scumbags.<br />They are.<br />But it's hard to imagine the Braxins, a culture that values a good emnity more than friendship - and scorns friendship - turning out a pleasant person.  And it's hard to imagine an Azean who could stand against the best the Braxins have to offer being anything nice.<br />Actually, there is a nice Braxin.  Don't worry, he's persuaded to change.  He wasn't that nice either.  Never mind.<br />It's unfortunate that Braxin, with its 42 speech modes, doesn't translate fully into English.  A speech that has a way to explicitly express what we have to use unreliable tones to express would be interesting to read.  Trying to pick out the third level of speech left unstated by word or speech mode would be even better. Listening to two masters of the speech duel would be something I would like to have the capability to read in it's original language.<br />Did I mention the book is brilliant?  From the front of each chapter, which provides a quote from the founders of the Braxins (one of the main races), to the chapters themselves, it reads quickly and well, never getting bogged down in details, but filling in enough to give you a very strong sense of two cultures, and the some of the sub-cultures within them.  For better and for worse.  Proud accomplishment is tempered by difficulty and unexpected consequence.<br />Finally, after 700+ pages, the story is closed, without a clear winner.  But closed nevertheless.<br />It is illustrative that the book comes with Anzha - the Azean -on the front cover in one edition (pictured above) and Zatar - the Braxin - on the front cover in the other edition.  I picked up a copy with Zatar on the front cover, and read it with him as protagonist.  Then, I saw Anzha on the front cover of another copy of the book, and I was rocked.  Two protagonists.  Reading it looking from the other side yields just as much depth.  Either one is a good central focus.<br />Two bits from within the book illustrate the book itself:<br />1 - A poet is comissioned to speak a poem for a diverse group of people.  Having tried and discarded themes, the poet picks a large overarching theme that no one can admit to really believing, but does, and listens enraptured while the poet tells the story, because of her mastry of the language.<br />2 - There is a thing called the k'airth-v'sa - literaly 'mate of the private war' where two people are bound in a vendetta that strengthens them as they seek to eliminate their weaknesses and exploit their opponent's.<br />Lastly, a quote from the front of a chapter:<br />&quot;A man who will not resort to violence must find his own ways to manipulate men&quot; - Harkur<br />Nice philosophy.	2000-09-29
US	52351823	RCS66L98R3U3T	0441569595	769194143	Neuromancer	Books	5	1	3	N	Y	Created a genre	Actually, that's not entirely true.  _True names and otherdangers_ is the first book to have something like the Internet and isa lot more computer literate than Gibson - who wrote Neuromancer on atypewriter.  _Shockwave Rider_ has a fair amount of the concepts, andis pretty predictive as well - anyone who survived the 90s is likelyto appreciate the plug-in lifestyle.  _Neuromancer_ is hardly thefirst cyberpunk novel.  It's just the best.<br />Gibson has beencharacterized as a hack.  Fair enough.  I personally can't stand hislater work.  His short stories are strong, his characters areinteresting enough, and the story lines in later books develop themquite well.<br />Newer novels have expanded the genre more.True.<br />Gibson had one idea, and it spawned a whole school of writing.One that I enjoy.  Yes, I'm a foaming, rabid Gibson fan.  Have beensince I picked up Neuromancer on fine summer day in the early 80s.  Istudied chemistry for a time (and used to do computer simulations ofchemical models), and I remember pawing though an organic chemsitrytext to draw out the structure of a carcinogen.  So the jargon didn'tthrow me much.  My answering machine greeting was lifted straight fromthe Finn for a time.<br />If you really want to know where cyberpunk camefrom, the strange amalgamation of cultures, computers and biology, youhave to read this book.  Then you realize that more than likely, thecyberpunk you're reading is an offshoot.<br />But if you look at thewriting of the period, Gibson did something totally different.  Goneis the Golden Age writing, where smart scientists dispense wisdom andeasy, clever solutions.  Enough of the apocalyptic writing of the 70s.The world is not perfect, but it's not going to end any time soon.It's just here...  Get over it.  <br />And read this book.	2000-09-26

This book does so, but not the overly self-aware coolness associated with Cryptonomicon or Heavy Weather (by Bruce Sterling).<br />It's fun, it's never serious - even when someone is trying to destroy the world - and it makes you turn the pages.<br />I read a lot of science fiction, and am a rabid Gibson fan, and when I read this book, all I could say was 'cool'.  The world, and the cyberworld.  The arcane references to the Sumerians.  Da5id.

Reading the other reviews before paning this book, I realize I just must be getting jaded.<br />Clio - the main character - didn't impress me as a strong character.<br />The weird plot twists were just over the top.  Everyone  was so busy advancing their own agenda and lying to everyone else you just  had no idea what was really going on.  Except for the fact that there were  good guys and bad guys.  The good guys were on the side of right, and  always lied for good purposes.  The bad guys lied to advance their  nefarious agendas.<br />And this whole environmental apocalypse thing.  Ho  hum.  _Sheep Look Up_ was sorta fun in that hysterical environmental sort  of way.

There are some fairly harsh descriptions of things in here, and they are done in such a matter of fact way that it's fairly unpleasant to read.  Mosts authors would revel in  the inhumanity of the antagonists, rather than simply put it out there for  your consideration. In addition, the ending is really irritating.  It's  pure Deus ex machina.  You know what has to happen, you figure there's no  way it will, then it does.  There is a neat twist, but it's still  dissatisfying. On the other hand, the book is a very good read, and I  enjoyed it quite a bit.  I prefer Fire Upon the Deep, but let's face it -  most novels aren't that good.
