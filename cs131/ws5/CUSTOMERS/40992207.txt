This was a great story, I fell in love with Claires sweetness and the way the autor portrayed her, and who would not love a man like Bud? SO caring and in love with her. I tingle when I think of that snake tattoo, and those who have read the book know what I mean. What woman would not want a big tender man like that to come along and rescue her? I love Rice and hope that her other books are as wonderful.A keeper.	2005-09-23

Even though the book is titled Lacy she is just one of several female leads and I dont like that. I bought this book because I have read Noelle by Palmer and enjoyed that because of the focus on the male and female leads, it was also a simple story line. Skip Lacy.	2005-05-21

It seems that one day the girl is used to servants and living on a plantation, the next she has very rapidly become used to things such as guns, being on the run and the type of life that goes with that, being alone with a man and then living and conversing with indians. On top of that she seems to become part of the indians overnight and even gives birth like them (she must not scream or even cry out, etc) and all of this she embraces with hardly any trouble. My liking for the hero was on and off, sometimes he treated the heroine very lovingly and then the next instant he's leaving her and their son to go off and fight or do whatever it is he thinks is more important. I expected a better book, such as Brandewynes \\"The Outlaw Hearts\\" which was very well written and very flowing.	2005-05-08

The book started out with a good story line but in the middle and end it just left me irritated and disapointed. DID Cal ever figure out how much he had hurt Michelle with his behavior? Did he ever fugure out that she died thinking he did not love her? Cal was very unlikeable to me and seems to have gotten off too easy. If he was so afraid of kids then why was he not afraid of his newborn daughter? Did Jeffs mother ever blame the family for her sons death? Perhaps I am putting more into the book than it deserves but I do not like to be left with unanswered questions and I would have preffered to hear more about the blind girls life.	2004-11-15

It starts out with a good story and then goes downhill from there, I skipped about 29 pages just to get through to the end. The way a vampire is turned is gross and ridiculous (males have to have (...) intercourse with other male vampires while they are having (...)with a female vampire, and more) If you like vampire stories that have the male vampire falling in love and staying with his love and defending her, etc, DO NOT get this book. Its trash.	2004-04-14

I did not care about  any of the characters because there was no depth to them either.

The ending of this book was also lousy.	2003-07-28

Why did she ruin a deep friendship by not telling Claire about the reason Virginia left? Why not just say what happened, I do not understand her need to hide that. But anyway, you will have to read the book to see what I am talking about.	2003-05-12

The \\"hero\\" is very unlikeable and cruel, always raping his tiny wife and sleeping with other women. The heroine is likeable but stupid to put up with him and being tortured. The constant rape theme in Coulters books has really turned me off of her, but I did enjoy Beyond Eden because that story was really moving and the hero in that one was a real hero who helped Eden get past her traumatic past with gentleness and love. One of Coulters better books and one I will keep. Fire Song will be resold along with her other \\"I will rape and beat you, but I do love you\\" type books.	2003-05-02

I have really enjoyed all of her SEALS stories, but this one was missing something, I think it was because the main characters slept together immediately without really getting to know each other first. I prefer a buildup and letting them get to know each other first. Plus at times I found Savanna to be silly and irritating. I did enjoy hearing about Allyssa and Sam again and really wanted the story to focus more on them, hopefully Brockman will write a book focused on their on or off relationship. Overall a good story, but not one of her best, try her other SEALS stories first.	2002-03-28

Its characters had no depth and it was hard for me to feel any emotion towards any of them, also the plot was boring. The characters were not well-described and I still dont really have a picture of what the DA Hammond Cross (main character) looks like. Actually I dont really know what any of the people look liked because they were barely described. If you want to read really good books by Brown pick up &quot;Envy&quot;, &quot;Breath of Scandal&quot; or &quot;Best Kept Secrets&quot; which are only a few of her great ones.	2002-01-13

Does she not have any common sense at all? The things she will do without even thinking about consequences are ridiculous, she is not even concerned by the fact that MOG can get into her house and write on her body when she is asleep...HMMM, can  we say 'stupid'? Also rape is used against her and she apparently comes through it with no mental or even physical injury even though the writer of this book portrayed the man as brutal, I find that very upsetting and it downplays a horrible act. I have ususlly enjoyed the books by Layman but I think I wasted my money with this one.	2002-01-08
