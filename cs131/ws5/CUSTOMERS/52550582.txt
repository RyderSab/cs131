This is to say, a massive whitewash is underway to convince Americans that she wouldn't absolutely destroy their lives. Obviously, this effort will persuade quite a number of people; to put it charitably, it's been quite a while since the average American could be described as a critical thinker. <br /> <br />So, this book is the first salvo in what will almost certainly emerge as the most significant political campaign in modern American history. It's a masterful piece of propaganda, and reads well - as one might expect from a writer as talented as Ms. Estrich. But it is propaganda nonetheless. If you are (1) open-minded, and (2) motivated to some degree by gender, then please consider the rational alternative - Condoleeza Rice (honestly, the open-minded part is sufficient...).	2005-10-12

One wonders where Mr. Galloway finds the time to slap together such an assortment of lies and propaganda as this, given the inordinate demands that counting massive piles of cash from Hussein must make on his schedule. Perhaps he's employed one of the lesser clods he purports to represent to do the counting and stacking for him. <br /> <br />It is insufficient to call this man an apologist for Hussein's regime - the word calls to mind the image of one who makes excuses for another's bad behavior, while remaining, technically, apart. But Galloway's clear, unmistakable affinity for Hussein and islamofascists, and hatred for the West, calls for something a bit more substantial. Indeed, time spent with Galloway, in any form, gives one the impression that he yearned for an intimacy of involvement with thugs in the fashion of, let's say, holding Iraqi women down while Uday \\"had his way\\" with them. The man is repugnant; his book is therefore what one would expect. Which is to say, it will certainly find it's audience, particularly in America.	2005-10-02

We have all become accustomed to discourse via amplified insult; measured voices such as Hertzberg's are refreshing indeed. Having said this, it amounts to nothing more than a shame. When a leftist advances his argument with the typical manic lunacy, we may simply dismiss him as a fool. Hertzberg, however, cannot be so dismissed. He is bright and learned. Unfortunately, he's got it all wrong. All the facts are on the table, and the judge appears to be fair. Yet the judgment is random and chaotic - the judge has added it up as if following a different arithmetic altogether. After reading Hertzberg's work, one has the queasy feeling one gets watching news coverage of the person dragged off to the asylum, leaving puzzled neighbors in his wake saying \\"he seemed so normal.\\" Something's gone wrong, and no one can quite figure out how it happened. A shame, indeed.	2005-08-14

Someone who, having had evidence put to them, refuses to acknowledge said evidence and falls back on tired bromides as if the other person had never spoken at all. When confronted with such a person, one is shocked at how disconnected they are from reality - the mind reels as if they had denied the existence of gravity. Well, Gloria Feldt is just such a person. Perhaps it's that she's in way over her head when it comes to law. Perhaps it's that she's too close to her subject. Perhaps it's that she's not terribly bright. Whatever the reason, her book is utter claptrap and nonsense. Look, I actually support strong abortion rights and would oppose any effort to weaken Roe v. Wade.

As the black underclass experience has disintegrated, its victims - those living it - haven't sought to expose it for what it is - sick and degenerate. No - instead of calling it out, they defend and advance it as authentically black. And those who do have the guts to tell it straight are assailed as racists, bigots, and, if black, Uncle Toms. Or, in Dyson's phraseology, \\"afristocrats.\\"  <br />  <br />To some degree, this is understandable. With the Stockholm Syndrome, the kidnapped is compelled to humanize and identify with the captor, principally because the urge to do so is human. Similarly, one is driven to find value in one's experience, despite what may be overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The culture may be diseased, but for those living it, it is seductive to construct elaborate justifications and excuses for its failures, redefine values to the point of twisting them entirely out of shape, and demonize anyone with the intellectual honesty to tell it like it is (read: Cosby). <br />  <br />The part that's not understandable is how our brethern like Dyson sleep at night. As the black underclass psyche struggles to find yet another mechanism by which to excuse the culture's disease and failure, in spite of what has become an insurmountable body of evidence, Dyson, instead of using whatever intellecual gifts he possesses to advance truth, serves up another helping of tripe to the needy. How long, I wonder, will it take for the cripped victims of this disintegrated culture to get such words as \\"afristocracy\\" and \\"ghettocracy\\" out of their systems? How many more kids will get shot? Babies abandoned by fathers? Jails populated? Hard to say, but probably quite a few. <br /><br />The bottom line? MLK wouldn't have approved. Dyson is taking advantage of folks who are thirsty to be told they're not off track, despite what people like Cosby say. He's making a buck off people's need. These are old, failed ideas dressed up - the same ones that have been running black culture into the ground for about 40 years. Finally, people like Cosby are starting to step up to speak truth. It's a shame they have to shout it to be heard over immoral opportunists like Dyson. <br />  <br />At this point, you may be suspecting I didn't care for this book. You're right. I didn't. I'm black, and I'm sick of the apologists. I'm sick of \\"hip-hop culture.\\" I'm sick of hearing the same, tired stuff. I'm particularly sick of people in my community falling for the trap - you can't say what I'm saying without being precisely the people Dyson warns about. Used to be, you were an Uncle Tom. Now, evidently, you're an afristocrat. Whatever. But a lot of my brothers and sisters fall for this twisted, circular reasoning every time, and I'm just sick of it. This is one book no one needs and many will be hobbled by. Don't be one of them.	2005-05-04

I'll only add two points:     1) The following has been mentioned, but probably not enough. Malkiel, at most, presents a semi-strong case for efficiency. The core of his argument is that while inefficiencies exist, they are short-lived and of a nature such that only professionals can reliably exploit them. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the average non-professional should act as if the market is efficient. This, in essence, is his case for indexing.     2) The most vituperative reviews are written by technical analysts - confirm for yourself below. I'll say only this: it may not be coincidence that these particular reviewers are uniquely incapable of spelling correctly and occasionally edge toward incoherence. Draw your own conclusions - I'll say no more.	2005-03-08

The very best thing the left can do is assert itself unapologetically; when they do so, they lose. The curious thing is that the left believes, perversely, that their past success was an era of open progressivism to which they must return. More power to them! The truth is, of course, that their past successes depended exclusively on manipulations and sleights-of-hand that have finally been unraveled. The emperor, now naked, is flatly and consistently rejected; those of us thankful for this fortunate turn cannot be more pleased to see the left so clueless as to believe that the trick is to assert said nakedness proudly! <br /> <br />Have at it.

As an advocate of reason (and therefore free market economics) who is (1) practical enough not to vote libertarian until we can rank votes, (2) tolerant enough to live side by side with Christians whose values I share although believing said values spring more convincingly from reason than from the Bible, and (3) certain that FDR, LBJ and WJC have shredded this nation, I wholeheartedly embrace any such effort as this book. The one thing the authors have right is that the divide exists, and it is truly great (and becoming greater). The analysis is so far off the mark, however, that it is absurd. But that's what makes this a truly marvelous book. <br /> <br />The good news is that they really don't have any choice. Clinton et. al. may have triangulated to appear palatable, but with the ascendancy of the new media, Michael Moore, the Dean crowd, moveon.org and thousands of crazed leftist supporters will never again allow such a watered down approach. Only one thing has changed - everyone now sees the dems for what they are; there is no going back. And they cannot win by advancing more forcefully what is so odious to so many, as this book suggests. Either way, it's a win for the good side. But how much more entertaining to watch them seal their fate by unapologetically advancing undiluted leftism, to the abhorrence of all who happen to care for the American experiment. <br /> <br />NOTE: the book can be had for free from retrovsmetro.org in PDF format. Whichever way you go is fine - purchase it and finance the insanity, sealing the dems fate further. More of this sort of gobbledy-gook only helps, through the back-door, so to speak. Alternatively, grab it for free, and get a little personal pleasure over denying some cash to those who would take your money and finance all manner of irrationality with it.

DuBois, which are of course silly as DuBois was a serious thinker and writer (one greatly overshadowed by Frederick Douglass, but that's another subject altogether). You'll also see comparisons to such a luminary as Dyson, which, on the other hand, are appropriate as Dyson is an idiot with nothing to say. However, the least known fact about this book is that it was written by Powell's dog. <br /> <br />Admittedly, I exaggerate. I suspect that Powell himself actually did sit down and tap this out on his very own computer, or some such. But you do have to take it on faith, because there is no evidence whatsoever of a thinking person behind what amounts to a glut of words arranged to create the appearance of sentences, paragraphs, and thoughts. Indeed, the whole enterprise brings to mind the bit about the infinite monkeys, with infinite time, and War and Peace - oh, wait a minute - in that version, a real book comes out in the end. Here, well, let's just say that 2 or 3 monkeys with their respective typewriters for an hour or two will suffice. <br /> <br />It is not inconceivable that people exist who think this book has some redeeming value. After all, there are people who pay good money for scribblings drawn by elephants with paintbrushes in their trunks. Of course, now that I think about it, even those elephants are assisted by their trainers, so there's a human intelligence at work as well ... ok, well, the analogy's not perfect. The point is, if you're one of the 10 or 12 people who will get something from the book, whether appreciation of the pretty colors, or recollections of the author's time on MTV, well, have at it. Everybody else, hopefully, started investigating other reading material long before reaching the end of this review.	2004-10-30

To paraphrase, De Toqueville observed that America's success depended upon an informed, rational public to an unprecedented extent. The success of this book demonstrates just how much trouble this country is in - or, to put a positive spin on it, makes clear just where the battle lines are drawn. Yes, technically, the clintons are part of history. And so is John Wayne Gacy. But presumably a book trumpteting that fact with his leering mug on the cover would elicit, at the very least, disdain from the buying public. The fact that this book is not met universally with the same is astounding, and of course, alarming. To put it bluntly - if clinton had any integrity whatsoever, she'd be ashamed of the fact that she is part of American history. And so would the reviewer from Columbus.<br />Let's be clear. This book reads like an unwitting autopsy, a confirmation of De Toqueville's worst fears. One might think that hillary is merely deluded, if not for the lies she tells (both massive and frequent) to cover and dodge. She knows what she's doing; her willingness to continue doing it is sickening.	2003-12-23

But the clintons, in their relentless self-aggrandizement, seem to be incapable of ratcheting down even slightly their efforts to build monuments to themselves in the complete absence of accomplishment. If one were being charitable, one might suggest that the title indicates nothing more than the observation that one is living in historic times. But it is, of course, the other meaning that clinton and her (and his, for that matter) apologists intend - that the clintons themselves are living history. this would be laughable if it weren't so sickening.

I am not used to seeing  such abominations as these in titles from Wrox Press; say what you will  about Microsoft, the author's software, etc., the point is that none of it  has anything to do with the subject at hand, on which Wrox Press typically  focuses like a laser. The editors really dropped the ball in a couple place  on this one - there were two authors who sorely needed to be kept in check.	2000-06-19

Ms. Noonan has presented her argument cogently.  Much as it saddens me to say, this book echoes the view of Hillary Clinton  I slowly came to admit to myself with reluctance over the course of 8  years. If you find yourself with misgivings concerning the nature of the  Clintons, read this book. Finally, in the end, we'll all have to face the  true nature of these people, I suppose. Books like Ms. Noonan's are the  first stage of the healing process.	2000-04-09
