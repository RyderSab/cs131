There are a lot of authors who take on the absurdities of mainstream religion, but books that cut to the quick with this degree of lucidity are rare. \\"The End of Faith\\" has quotable material on nearly every page. Moreover, Harris' reasoning is so astute and so devastating to mainstream nonsense that Publishers Weekly has described \\"The End of Faith\\" as a \\"sometimes simplistic and misguided book\\" and then, they feint astonishment that Harris doubts the \\"rationality\\" of \\"faith.\\"  Considering the new age drivel that these folks praise routinely, Harris should take this criticism as badge of honor.  Intellectually, America is an adolescent country which makes \\"The End of Faith\\" a book for grownups.  I think Sam Harris has the potential to be the Robert Ingersoll of the 21st century. Highly recommended.	2004-12-04

I'm an outsider to academia, although I have been writing about self-education for nearly two decades. I read this book while finishing a book of my own about lifelong learning to be published in 2004. Cottom's book was like riding an intellectual lightning bolt, powerful enough to cause me to reexamine some of my fundamental ideas. If you are truly interested in theories of higher education and its utility, then you can't afford not to read &quot;Why Education Is Useless.&quot; Cottom's book raises questions worthy of a lifetime of reflection.	2003-11-17

One of Delta's music features available on their headset selection at the time was &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; which I listened to while reading &quot;Samsara.&quot; It was a perfect match to the text. Lewis is great at both characterization and suspense. <br />I'm personally preoccupied with the concept of joss and write about it myself in a somewhat different sense than Lewis does. So, if you don't know your joss, then you need read this book to find out what it is. Highly recommended.	2003-11-15

I've spent a fair amount of time researching this theme in preparation for writing a sequel to a novel. There are a number of good books on the subject, \\"Evil in Modern Thought\\" and \\"A Problem from Hell,\\" are two that I recommend highly. <br />Morrow's book is, however, in a class by itself, because of the way he directs questions of morality to the reader so that you have little choice, but to get personally involved in his exposition.  This, in my view, is the whole point of studying the matter.<br />I find the smug and condescending review by Publishers Weekly to be excruciatingly irritating and suggest that the reviewer should take a hard look at his or her own objectivity. Morrow's book is incredibly thoughtful and deserves a wide audience.	2003-09-01

Schumaker's work at every available opportunity. Amazon has a standing order to notify me any time he releases a new work. In my view, he is one of the world's most gifted explainers of the human condition. In the preface to &quot;The Age of Insanity,&quot; Schumaker expresses a love affair with the &quot;big picture.&quot; This affection comes through on every page. That this book was published in September 2001, amounts to a prophetic explanation point at the ending of one era and the beginning of another. If you have concerns over the state of mental health in the world today, then I highly recommend &quot;The Age of Insanity.&quot;	2002-01-08

There are lots of books about how to save money when you are building a house, but this is the first one I've ever read that shows you how you can maximize your comfort while insuring that you don't pay an unnecessary fortune in taxes during the life of your home. Every building contractor should read this book as a strategy for basic survival, but if you are building your own home independently, then you can't afford not to read it.	2001-07-20

I shied away from it at first because of my aversion to books with the word spirituality in the title. The term is used so often and in so many ways that I'm never certain what it means. I should have know better in Berman's case. This is a fascinating read, and it  raises questions about the history of consciousness which should have been aired decades ago, were it not for the tendency of scholarship to converge into group-think. One thing for sure, Berman is always out in front, ahead of the group. His complete confidence and maturity of thought enables him to lay out paragraph after paragraph of serious thought and then wrap it up  with a personal statement that shows he respects the reader more than the institutions that rein over serious subject matter. If you want to read something that will give you food for thought for years to come, read &quot;Wandering God.&quot;	2000-10-30

Shel Horowitz is a publicist  extraordinaire, and &quot;Grassroots Marketing&quot; is head and shoulders  above the crowd in its genre because it contains timeless information that  is both creative and economically practical. Whether you are an  entrepreneur, an independent publisher or a media magnate, your efforts in  securing publicity must address economic sensibility or at some point you  will likely experience failure.

His books \\"Coming to Our Senses\\" and \\"The Reenchantment of the  World\\" not only gave me new insights into the notion of a more embodied  existence, they also gave me a lasting epistemological appreciation of the  kind of rigor necessary to bring light to any subject that one truly wants  to learn more about. My views about the possibilities the future holds for  humankind run hot and cold. I'm optimistic one day and pessimistic the  next. But I've long held the position that while the mass of American  culture seems to be, as Neil Postman observed, \\"drowning in a sea of  amusements,\\" individuals still have an opportunity to live as meaningful a  life as is possible to live. Now Berman comes along with \\"The Twilight of  American Culture,\\" which captures this reality not only in a theoretical  sense but also in a very practical way. Berman advocates creating \\"zones of  intelligence\\" both public and private and says, \\"This is not about `fifty  ways to save the earth,' `voluntary simplicity,' or some program of trendy  ascetic activities. Nor does it involve anything showy and dramatic, and  virtually anyone reading this book is capable of making an effort in this  direction.\\" \\"The Twilight of America Culture\\" is a rear-guard action for  finding an oasis of meaning in an insane world.

Breaking Into Print is a clear, enthusiastic examination of what it takes to begin a writing project or to get one off dead center that has stalled. This book is a straightforward, no nonsense, step-by-step guide from the inception of your idea to seeing your finished work on display on a bookstore shelf or magazine rack. I'm in a unique position to know about this -- for more than a decade, LuAnne Dowling has edited my books, newsletter and essays. This book, like her editing, is written with affection for the reader. She shares with her co-author, Jane Evanson, an unfailing belief that everyone has something to say and can learn to express it well in writing. Breaking Into Print is a concise, thoughtful, and unpretentious crusade for clarity in a field that is often made to seem more complicated than it really is. If you've always wanted to write, but have had trouble getting started, here's your chance. Highly recommended.	1999-10-25

This is not pop-psychology but scientific inquiry at its best. Blackmore gives her critics the ammunition to discredit her theory and then invites them to do  so. But most of the criticism of her book amounts to an attack on  materialism by people who can't stand the thought that idealism is dead and  can't be argued into anything more than a wishful existence--which won't  stand up to scientific scrutiny. Scientists who autopsy the human brain are  never going to find a meme any more than they'll find a soul. The whole  field of memetics may amount to nothing more than a flashlight grope in a  cave, but it's a very thoughtful probe in the dark and it may be far more  useful than most.

This is one best cases for a more equitable society that I've ever read. The author can't be tagged as a liberal or conservative, though elements of both parties have attacked him as such. He writes, \\"By scaling back on the rate at which luxury consumption has been growing, we could drink safer  water, breath cleaner air, and eat food that is less likely to make us  seriously ill. We could have more autonomy, variety, and safety in the  workplace. We could fill the potholes in our streets, fix our crumbling  bridges, and provide more help for people with serious drug problems. We  could save enough to retire with complete financial security.\\" What I like  best about Frank's argument is the change a consumption tax would have on  wealthy people: it would restore them to the role of people to be admired  for their contributions and not just their wealth and their ability to  avoid taxes. Highly recommended.	1999-06-24

He says power justifies itself by pointing to powerlessness as proof of incapacity. Gems of wisdom like these appear throughout this book. \\"Being examined is one of the things you become an adult to avoid,\\" he writes. \\"Once you pass  twenty-five, you learn how to cover your weaknesses and ignorance and lead  with your strengths. Every adult, by definition, is a corner-cutting phony;  experience teaches you what to attend to and what to slough off, when to  rest and when to go all out.\\" One of my criteria for a great book is  finding I dread being finished reading with it.

Nussbaum tell us that Socratic questioning is still on trial, that becoming a citizen of the world is a lonely business, and that a visceral  and intellectual understanding of compassion is a key requisite.

Daniel Goleman's book &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot; shows how the undervaluation of emotion has wreaked pathological havoc on America. Divorce, depression, aggression, chronic anger, violence, ruined careers, and poor health are the evidence. When you think about it, in a \\"postmodern  world\\" where \\"reason\\" seems to be in perpetual danger of drifting into  chaos, it seems inevitable that the value of emotion would become a  meaningful topic. The truth is, of course, that emotions have always been  far more significant and consequential than the high-reasoning side of our  culture has been willing to acknowledge. It is a great paradox that  generations of suppressed emotions would lead to a backlash of  overvaluation of the notion that emotions are something one is not  responsible for--that when we're overcome by emotion, nothing can be done  about it. Emotional outrage often becomes the basis of successful criminal  defense strategies. On the other hand, millions of people do not realize  that feelings are to life experience as a wet finger is to wind direction,  and that emotion is also a veritable societal barometer. The key to  emotional intelligence is equilibrium. In a postmodern world, emotional  intelligence is equilibrium. Highly recommended.	1999-06-24

I have always been puzzled by anti-intellectualism. It never ceases to amaze me how America can be such a technological giant at the same time it is so easily duped by telephone psychics. Richard Hofstader puts the dilemma into historical perspective. He shows how intellect has come to be  \\"resented as a form of power and privilege\\" and how \\"at an early date  literature and learning were stigmatized as the prerogative of useless  aristocracies.\\" Such thinking remains a barrier to fighting racism and  achieving greater quality of life for all of us. This book offers deep  insights into how and why ignorance is still revered by so many people in  what is supposed to be an age of enlightenment. Highly recommend.	1999-06-24

Wilson has one of the finest scientific minds of the twentieth century. \\"Consilience\\" is a beautifully written, sweeping synthesis of science and the arts. Wilson writes, \\"The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of  complexity with reductionism makes science.\\" Wilson, like all of us,  appears to fall short of his objective at times, but what an effort! Where  are the books from his critics? None of the negative reviews I've read of  \\"Consilience\\" rise to the intellectual level of the work itself. Highly  recommended.	1999-06-24

I've reread it more times than any other, but never without reaching new insights and finding new inspiration.   It's filled with wisdom like the following: &quot;[I]t is a serious misapplication of psychology to make the presence or absence of neurosis  the touchstone of truth, and to argue that if a man's philosophy makes him  neurotic, it must be wrong. `Most atheists and agnostics are neurotic,  whereas most simple Catholics are happy and at peace with themselves.  Therefore the views of the former are false, and of the latter true.' Even  if the observation is correct, the reasoning based on it is absurd. It is  as if to say, `You say there is a fire in the basement. You are upset about  it. Because you are upset, there is obviously no fire.&quot; Watts talks  about the many subtle proprieties of life in which we are all engaged but  which we seldom discuss. Then, the instant you read them, you feel as if  your own thoughts had been read aloud.  I can't recommend this book highly  enough.	1999-06-24

Anderson tells us, \\"We are living in a new world, a world that does not know how to define itself by what it is, but only by what it has just-now ceased to be.\\" One of the most positive aspects of postmodernism in my view is that, because there is so much chaos of opinion today, reality is being  created in plain sight.

Dawkins is a gifted explainer. When he tells us that the spirit of wonder that leads to mysticism is the same that motivates great scientists, one is inclined to believe him. He turns the anxiety of those who despair at the  prospect of a brief non-eternal existence right back at them to ask how and  why, given such an opportunity, would you squander it in the grip of an  illusion which doesn't square with any of your practical experience.

People  don't get this upset (read the reviews) unless a nerve is directly  involved. At the very least, Harris has loosened a tooth-perhaps a wisdom  tooth.

For decades Ronald Gross has been bearing the torch for lifelong learning with unrelenting enthusiasm. I'll never forget many years ago discovering the first edition of his book, &quot;The Independent Scholar's Handbook.&quot; It gave me the confidence I needed at the time to take self-education seriously. What I would have given to have had a book like &quot;Peak Learning&quot; when I began my journey of lifelong learning.<br />My philosophy of autodidactic learning is to think of an education not as something you get but as something you take. The new edition of &quot;Peak Learning&quot; shows you how to proceed on such a journey for yourself.  Ronald Gross gives practical advice that seems like common sense, except that traditional education in America is far too focused on predetermined outcomes and spoon-fed knowledge. Many people who think themselves to be highly educated have little sense of their own strengths and learning styles. The result is a life of frustration and often a haunting feeling of inadequacy because they have never truly experienced the exhilaration of discovery based upon quenching their own thirst for knowledge.<br />In &quot;Peak Learning,&quot; Ronald Gross shows you how to gain the kind of confidence that will allow you to take charge of your education and dramatically change your life.
