Using this book helped me to earn honors in Legal Research and Writing, and I use it every time I write anything, be it a research memorandum or other work  product.  I cannot more strongly recommend this book, it will be invaluable  in any writing endeavor.  According to former University of Minnesota  Professor Irving Younger &quot;From now on, anyone who tries to write about  the law without this book close at hand will be guilty of literary and  perhaps of legal misfeasance.  In short an invaluable reference.&quot;   What more do you need to know.	2000-06-04

See infra review of Thomas Blackwell.  However, this book will not be very helpful to most users of the bluebook.  The book is very,  very brief and contains nothing not contained in the bluebook itself.   Further, the index of the bluebook allows easy location of the applicable  rules for even the most obscure of situations.  This very short book merely  reiterates that which is already contained in the bluebook, I would only  recommend this book to the truly bluebook clueless.	2000-06-04

This book should ideally be read after at least one semester of law school, I read it between my criminal law, and civil procedure exams.  If you do read it before beginning law school, fear not, its not as bad as  it sounds.	2000-06-04

It is a good casebook, although it should be about half the size it is.  Looking through my assigned readings, I crossed-out approximately a third of the pages  assigned as they were mainly poems, short stories, and excerpts of novels,  including the grapes of wrath, and a reprint of the lyrics to Love Me  Tender by Elvis Presley.  For those who enjoy the extra-legal readings this  book is ideal, for those who don't the readings will be half the pages  actually assigned, and the real contract law portions of this book are  competently done.	2000-06-04

The full hardback edition of the dictionary is a must own, as it contains everything that Black's has to offer.  In addition, I strongly recommend law students  purchase a compact pocket book edition to carry with you to class at all  times.  The pocket book edition is relatively inexpensive, under $10, so it  will only add slightly to the overwhelming cost of books in law school.   However, in whatever form you choose to buy, this dictionary is a must own,  unless you are fluent in Latin.	2000-06-04

It includes many extras, but especially useful is the text of the US Constitution with cross-references to specific pages of the Federalist Papers referring to  that provision.  I highly recommend the Federalist Papers generally, and  more specifically this edition to anyone wishing to know more about the  founding and ratification of the Constitution.	2000-05-13

If you have a choice as to which casebook to use, I would  recommend this one.	2000-05-05

This book provides lawyers  or law students with the analytic skills necessary to be successful at  practice and at class.  In addition if you do not develop those skills you  can always use the plethora of statutory cannons contained in this book.	2000-05-05

The true greatness of this casebook is that it renders hornbooks and other guides superfluous.  It is a truly great casebook in an area of the law I thought would bore me to death.

However, I would not lay the blame at the feet of what is an excellent casebook.  If one is looking for a quick and shallow statement of the  blackletter law then I recommend reading Emmanuel's (full disclosure: I was  a paid reviewer for Emmanuel's).  If you want to understand Constitutional  Law without having to read the cases, then I highly recommend American  Constitutional Law by Laurence Tribe, which is an excellent book in its own  right, and I would strongly recommend it in addition to the Gunther and  Sullivan casebook.  However, it is necessary in order to gain a full  understanding of the law to go through the process of case analysis.   <br />This is especially true in the field of Constitutional Law.  While it is  perhaps possible for one to become an expert on the topic of Criminal Law  or Torts on Emmanuel's alone, it is necessary to read the cases to fully  understand Constitutional Law.  This is because Constitutional law is  composed of primarily three things: first, the text of the Constitution  itself; second, historical documentation such as the Federalist Papers (I  strongly recommend the Mentor edition); and third, the cases themselves,  precedent.  This is the stuff that con law is made of, Justice Brennan and  the &quot;spirit&quot; of the Constitution notwithstanding.  <br />If you have  the capacity and the desire to learn constitutional law, I would strongly  recommend purchasing this casebook.  Gunther and Sullivan do an excellent  job of structuring the cases, and the notes will probe and challenge your  understanding of the material, and even provide a synopsis of the  &quot;law&quot; in case you failed to read the case as thoroughly as  perhaps you should have.	2000-05-04

This hornbook does an excellent job of covering the many complex issues of constitutional law in a well organized and surprisingly deep manner.  I was tempted to write that this book is second best only to Laurence Tribe's  American Constitutional Law, but after using both to study for my Con Law  final, I find that both do an excellent job, and have their strengths and  weaknesses.  <br />As such I would strongly recommend either, however, if you  do not mind investing heavily in Con Law books, I would recommend you  purchase both.	2000-05-04

However, I would strongly recommend purchasing the Mentor edition, as that edition contains the text of the Constitution, as  does this edition, but the Mentor edition has cross-references to specific  portions of the Federalist Papers which address that clause of the  Constitution.<br />In general the Federalist Papers is a must read, no matter  what edition you use, for anyone interested in the founding of the US, or  desiring to learn how our system of federalism, and separation of powers  was intended to work. I recommend reading numbers 10, 49, and 78 first.	2000-05-04

It is an excellent source to supplement and even embellish the law of Civil Procedure contained in whichever casebook you are using.  Since most Civil  Procedure courses are a year long, I would strongly recommend investing in  this hornbook, it is very handy to have when outlining and preparing for  finals.	2000-05-04

The Mentor edition (used by Scalia among others) is by far the best  edition of the Federalist Papers.  It includes substantial amounts of  related information, but of primary importance is the entire text of the  Constitution with cross references to specific pages of the Federalist  Papers on that topic.  This is an extremely useful tool to anyone desiring  to gain more knowledge about the Constitution and the founders intent, and  it is especially useful to anyone taking a Con Law class.<br />In general  the Federalist Papers is a must read for anyone interested in the founding  of the US, or desiring to learn how our system of federalism, and  separation of powers was intended to work.

I purchased this book as an individual who was undecided about this issue,  although with a leaning toward viewing affirmative action programs with  strict scrutiny.  In my opinion this book provided a well rounded and fair  presentation of this issue.  I found it to be an excellent source of  information and arguments written by some truly great minds, co-editor  Cornel West the most prominent among them.  I would highly recommend this  book to everyone with an open mind who wishes to gain greater insight and  more information on this issue.

This treatise on Constitutional Law is essential to every law student.  I am currently enrolled in first-year Constitutional Law course, and I open up this book at least once everyday.  The information contained in the book  almost always answers my question, but on the rare occasion it does not the  case cites and especially the secondary legal cites are excellent.

It is hard to read this book and not become cynical about the Supreme Court, however, I think scrutinized under the  proper wattage light, this book could be seen as having a potentially happy  ending.  I would recommend this book highly to anyone in the legal  profession, it is an intelligent narrative of the many decisions in two  areas of the law, death penalty and habeas corpus, and abortion.  It is  also an excellent inside look into the politics of the selection process of  Justices and the politics inside the Court.	2000-01-30

Books	4	21	21	N	N	Good book of basic law school test taking advice	This is a good book for pre-law students and 1Ls.  It gives some basic advice about how to think about and write law school exams.  However, I have one big caveat, there is not a &quot;secret&quot; to law school test  taking.  The keys are to know the black-letter law cold, and to be precise  and concise in your analysis, and to practice taking tests under test  conditions as much as possible.  This book is a good quick read for those  who have never taken a law school test, or who did not perform as well as  they would have liked.

This is a truly  enjoyable and entertaining book to read, but more than that it is profound  in its insight and wisdom into the organized religious structure of society  today.  Vidal uses the origins of the various religions and slightly veiled  fictional religions to present his thesis and critique of the monotheistic  religions.

If there is a secret other than hard work, it is to be found in this book.  This book enumerates, in great  detail, everything from setting up a work place, starting your writing, to  getting your work published.

In this book Levi gives an overview of the process of legal analysis and demonstrates how legal &quot;rules&quot; are made.  The book consists of primarily 3 parts.
