This short book, ostensibly a memoir of William Tolbert, a black man who lived most of his life on Millwood Farm, Buckingham Co., Virginia, has jacket commentary by former governor Mills Godwin and a Foreward by Virginius Dabney (at pp. xv-xvi).     While use of the term \\"memoir\\" may be true in the strictest sense (the book does indeed contain Johns' personal reminiscences concerning Tolbert), its focus is subtly different. Dabney himself notes that \\"[t]his is the story of life at Millwood Farm... where Dr. Johns and his six brothers and sisters grew up\\" (at p. xv). While Tolbert is described as the \\"central figure\\" who \\"came close to being the mainstay of Millwood,\\" Dabney adds that the book \\"is also the story of `Uncle Tom', another black man on the place...\\" (at id.). The list of sources (at p. 63) makes it obvious that Johns did not rely on any information gleaned from Tolbert's own children (see p. 11) to fill in the gaps in his early life (at p. 9). Clearly, this is more than a study of Tolbert's life. What Johns has done is to dress up a perfectly reputable, but unremarkable, account of Southside life in the guise of black biography.     The result is unique, if sometimes off-putting. It is hard, for example, to imagine a contemporary memoirist noting that, \\"Willie had a characteristic odor about him, an interesting mixture of leather harness, horse manure and b. o. His smell was as typical of Willie as frying bacon is of breakfast\\" (at p. 10). At the same time, it is interesting that in Jim Crow Virginia, the single hired workers \\"ate their meals in our kitchen in the winter, and in summer on the back porch. All their food, like ours, was prepared by my mother and whatever female help she might have\\" (at pp. 11-12). Pre-Civil War blacks were allowed to be communicants in white churches- they sat separately (see p. 19), and later, front pew seats were saved for whites in black churches on Big Meeting Sundays (at p. 52).     Perhaps most interesting are the small touches of early 20th century life in this \\"remote, secluded region... of quiet neighborhoods, and small well kept churches, of few tourist attractions, bad roads, and many fiercely loyal sons...\\" (at p. 5). We are told about drying fruits and vegetables on tin roofs (at p. 12), carrying hot bricks in the carriage for the ride to church on cold winter Sundays (at p. 17), and the prohibition of cards or checkers on that day (at p. 20). We are told how each boy in the family, upon his first return from college, became \\"Cap'n\\", at least to Mr. Tolbert (at p. 14), and are offered wonderful descriptions of the threshing machine (at pp. 31-32) and of a white boy's view of  black church services (at pp. 52-55).     For all its posturing, Willie Tolbert offers us a useful view of Southside life - it is too bad that more Virginia families have not produced similar recollections of life in the state.

US	44549820	R262HZ9L4DX28	0834110598	995272765	Villages nearby: A story of outreach in Alaska	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Glen Lewis Van Dyne, Villages Nearby: A Story of Outreach in Alaska (1985)	This is a well-meaning, but in the end disappointing, account of the author's pastorate in Sitka, Alaska from 1974 until the early 1980s. Van Dyne, a member of the Church of the Nazarene, had preached the gospel to imagined multitudes as a youth in the Kansas woods (see pp. 8-9), but later discovers \\"that my call to preach was not to be to large crowds but to small groups of people. It was not to be to distant lands and exotic peoples, but to those in my own native land\\" (at p. 9). This call took him to Hawaii, California, and, in due course, to Alaska. <br /> <br /> It is not that the author is tongue-tied. He can clearly recognize the apt phrase, from his own fear \\"of slipping into a velvet-lined rut\\" in southern California (at p. 13) to his statement that \\"Nazarenes in Sitka felt more affinity for fire trucks than tombstones\\" (at p. 33; their church was located between the old cemetery and the town's volunteer fire department). Van Dyne also mines the gold in others' conversations- from the people who christened his (non-reversing) car the \\"One-Way-mobile\\" (at p. 36) to the bereaved Inuit mother who told him, \\"'You have been like a Band-Aid to my heart!'\\" (at p. 86). The author transmits to us some of the region's strangeness. Thus we discover that he who is \\"top man on the totem pole\\" is the least significant, because more recent (at p. 62). Nor is \\"Eskimo ice cream\\" the expected Eskimo Pie, but rather \\"an uncooked dessert made by mixing Crisco or seal oil with generous portions of sugar and wild berries\\" (at pp. 67-68). In a region of 8-10' annual rainfall (at p. 20), we are introduced to cars used only to drive on ice-bound rivers in the winter (at p. 72) and buildings built on stilts so that their heat does not melt the permafrost (at p. 81). All this should make for a heady mix as Van Dyne describes his trials and triumphs as a minister of the Gospel. <br /> <br /> What appears lacking, however, is organization, and perhaps a spirit of true involvement. In many ways, Villages Nearby is reminiscent of a 19th century travel account; the pieces of a fascinating story are present, but an invisible wall separates the author from the people he chronicles. Van Dyne certainly makes the effort. In discussing the origin and development of ACTS-TV (at pp. 50 ff.), he offers some insight into the lives of interesting individuals such as Don Ethulein (at pp. 48 ff.) and Roger Adams (at pp. 77 ff.). At other points of the narrative, however, Van Dyne seems to be just \\"going through the motions.\\" The death of his brother's family in an air crash takes up less than three pages (see pp. 103-05), and is immediately followed by an account of a helicopter crash and rescue that involved him and his son (see pp. 105-08). While the author may have grouped these occurrences in his Epilogue to strengthen the book's Christian message, their placement fritters away important elements of the story he has to tell. Nor does it make sense to spend three pages on his call to Alaska (at pp. 14-16) and cover his departure from Sitka in four sentences (see p. 97). The Alaskan wilderness has a way of dwarfing human endeavors. It is a pity that something similar appears to have happened to what might have been a first-rate testimony. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-07-19
US	44549820	RYN00KZ1CBQ7S	B0006WQ6H8	222913021	Around the corner after World War I	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Joseph C. Eddins, Around the Corner After World War I (1977)	This paperback book of slightly more than fifty pages deals with life on \\"The Corner\\", a commercial section of Charlottesville that abuts, and generally caters to, the University of Virginia and its students. The author, presumably a relative of the F.A. Eddins who co-managed the University Shop (see p. 18), has produced a work in elegant, but legible, calligraphy (with a well-done sketch at pp. 40-41). The book, paperback notwithstanding, is so pretty, that one expects to be disappointed by the content in a \\"nice but brainless\\" combination. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Eddins has not only \\"cornered\\" the volume's layout, but he has produced a short but elegant study somewhat parallel to James Alexander's Early Charlottesville Recollections (1942). Few Wahoos will read this book and not come away with a better appreciation of the Corner's pre-War culture. I found it interesting, for example, that the redoubtable Mincer's was not established until after World War II (at p. 47). <br /> <br /> Noting the strategic intersection of the C&O and the Southern railway in the town (at p. 1), Eddins gives us a picture of Charlie Hopkins, who delivered trunks from the station to student lodgings (at pp. 1-2), and follows this with a sketch of Captain Schnieder, the newsman (at pp. 2-3). Charlie Zehab, who left Charlottesville after shooting a man he found with his wife (he magnanimously took her too- at pp. 6-7), is covered, as is Walter Page, the florist, who delivered floral displays for 7 Society funerals (at p. 30). Local landmarks like \\"Score Bridge\\" (at pp. 33-34) and \\"Kenmore Kennels\\" (at p. 47) are identified, while structural problems with the Student Health Building are explained (see pp. 15-17) and the fact noted that the statue of Homer in front of Cabell Hall is \\"off center with the Rotunda from  to  inch\\" (at p. 33). Eddins gives us pictures of the football team suiting up at Memorial Gym before proceeding to Lambeth Field (see p. 36) and the jam sessions at the pool hall under the Virginian (at pp. 44-45). Particularly attractive are the accounts of the two University \\"mascots\\" buried in front of the University Cemetery on McCormick Road- \\"Beta\\", who was \\"lettered\\" before many games, and returned from such distant locales as Richmond, Washington, and Atlanta (at pp. 49-50), and \\"Seal\\", who entered University folklore when he urinated on a Pennsylvania cheerleader's microphone (at pp. 51-52). Readers interested in music will also be interested to hear Eddins' explanation of how \\"The Good Old Song\\" became Guy Lombardo's theme (see pp. 52-53). <br /> <br /> In short, Around the Corner is a very pleasant surprise, not only pleasing to the eye, but informative to boot. One might have wished that Eddins had included a sketch map of the area he covers so well, but his book remains a significant contribution to Charlottesville lore. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-07-19
US	44549820	R2KHLRJEVD5AR8	0393059898	258613410	The Remarkable Baobab	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Thomas Pakenham, The Remarkable Baobab (2004)	In his introduction, Pakenham notes, \\"[h]ere's a book bursting with ripe baobabs .... It's a personal book like its predecessors. I have scoured the world for baobabs with shapely limbs and unusual characters\\" (at p. 8). Here's the reality. Of the eight species of baobab, Pakenham has only seen five (missing three in Madagascar because \\"one of my family was ill and I was on borrowed time\\" (at p. 30; see also p. 8). That trip was made back in 2001, suggesting that Pakenham may have a different concept of \\"scouring\\" than the rest of us. Nor are any pictures of the three missing species offered, although a large number of the photographs in this book come from Corbis (see p. 142), with one illustrating a baobab in the Comoros (at pp. [122]-[23]), an archipelago that Pakenham does not appear to have visited, while another picture prominently features a non-baobab (at pp. [122]-[23]). This volume appears to be an offshoot of the author's Remarkable Trees of the World (2002), although there is evidence that Pakenham has incorporated materials from recent trips to St. Croix (see p. 127) and South Africa (see pp. 14, 97, 134). Why did he not return to Madagascar when this meant leaving almost 40% of the world's baobab species uncovered? <br /> <br />     The photographs of baobabs included in the book will mesmerize most readers; the trees are worthy subjects, and between his own photos, Corbis, Kew, and his British publisher, Pakenham has put together a wonderful collection of pictures. Those of us who have seen baobabs - my own first experience was in the Mozambique bush - find them unforgettable, and this excitement has been conveyed to potential readers. Fewer, though, will find all of Pakenham's chatty comments attractive. His description of his companion at Leydsdorp (apparently his wife- see the photograph at p. 94) as a \\"slip of a girl\\" (at p. 97), for example, seems a bit too much. <br /> <br />     The author does, however, have the gift of a light touch, andis able to convey a mass of information about the trees to his readers. Several facts were new and interesting to me although I researched the topic over a quarter of as century ago at Yale. These included the pods' appearance in Cairo markets in the 16th century (at p.13) and the 15th and 16th century graffiti found by Adanson on baobabs in Senegal in the 1750's (at p. 55). Herbert Basedow, who investigated a baobab in Australia in 1916, found bleached bones and a skull with a bullet hole (at p. 117), but Pakenham has no reference to the explorer in his bibliography (at p. 137; the information may come from Pat Lowe's The Boab Tree (1998), which is listed). Equally interesting is the probable importation of the tree to the Caribbean by black slaves (see pp. 127-28) and the legend that a hollow in the tree, opening at the full moon, would lead children back to Africa (at p. 131). The \\"upside-down\\" nature of the tree is explained in several stories (see p. 14)- a version not given by Pakenham states that the Creator replanted the tree in disgust, with its roots sticking out, after it had complained several times about its surroundings and had been duly replanted. The author does a good job of describing both the baobab's utility to native cultures and the uses to which it has been put by colonists. Not only can one pound a nail into the trunk without a hammer (see p. 13), but I can personally testify that a sharp twig can pierce the trunk. It is unfortunate that the distribution of species given  (at p. 139) is not accompanied by a map. <br /> <br />     In sum, The Remarkable Baobab is a flawed, but ultimately fascinating, discussion of one of the world's arboreal wonders. One can but hope that other works will appear which deal more thoroughly with this genus. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee	2005-05-25

It is ostensibly about Spix's Macaw, a bird fluttering on the edge of extinction (although no specific evidence is offered that it is \\"the World's Rarest Bird\\" (see p. [iii])). At the same time, the book deals with parrots in general, considers avian extinctions where relevant, and makes us think deeply about mankind's relationship with Nature. <br /> <br />     The section on \\"parrots in history\\" is particularly good, although it is here that Juniper pulls the one major bona fide boner of his work. The Emperor Heliogabulus did not rule from 222 to 205 B. C. (see p. 37), but rather from 218 to 222 A. D. It is interesting to note that the bird shown in the portrait of William Brooke, Baron Cobham, appears to be an unknown variety of parrot (see p. 40) and to find that several Caribbean macaws have vanished since the early days of exploration (at pp. 119-20). Juniper doesn't miss a beat in pointing out that many of the parrots allegedly carried by pirates may have been worth more than the loot they stole (see p. 121)! We are shown the place of parrots in Christian theology- one supposedly learned to recite The Lord's Prayer (at p. 44) and are informed that parrot tongues were occasionally eaten to cure speech impediments (at id.). It is therefore strange to find no mention of the role of the \\"parrot spy\\" for plantation masters in Black American folklore (see Richard M. Dorson, American Negro Folktales 120-23 (1968)) and not to have Monty Python's Dead Parrot sketch mentioned until page 236. <br /> <br />     Juniper is excellent in painting a portrait of the life of a Spix's Macaw, as well as providing information on parrot \\"hand-eye coordination\\" (see pp. 42-43), \\"dialects\\" (at pp. 44-45), and bonding with specific individuals (at p. 50; I remember one Brazilian friend telling me of a family parrot who loved him, but who was finally given away because of his hostile attitude towards the boy's mother). What make's Juniper's book special, however, is the information and vignettes it contains: Tony Silva, the renowned breeder, whose bird-smuggling activities brought him a prison term (at pp. 77-80), the wildlife market at Duque de Caxias (at p. 89), the raid on a Paraguayan wildlife dealer's house (at pp. 139-41), and the tragicomic dance between Brazilian authorities and breeders to save Spix's Macaw (see pp. 160 ff.). At the same time, Juniper does not (and perhaps legally cannot) name names to accompany all the rumors of foreign bird ownership (see pp. 153-54) and fails to comment on what seems to be an obvious parallel between the world's first endangered species studbook (for the European Bison- started in 1932- see p. 159) and the political events which led to World War II and the Holocaust. Those who wish to read more in the area will be hindered by the fact that the volume has no bibliography. <br /> <br />     What Spix's Macaw does do, however, is to bring home the poignancy of this dwindling species and to make us view its travails in a larger context. Despite minor faults, this book is a wonderful addition to any environmental bookshelf, and no one who reads the volume will put it down unmoved. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee	2005-05-25
US	44549820	R2R6MPW9IUUDIR	0810835541	390965334	American Travellers Abroad	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Harold Smith, American Travellers Abroad: A Bibliography of	Is it possible to produce an important bibliography that at the same time possesses major deficiencies? American Travellers Abroad suggests that the answer is yes. The second edition of a work initially published by Southern Illinois University, the book currently includes some 1894 entries (up from approximately 1800 in the original; p. v). Items are identified by an alphabetical numeration, thus John Lloyd Stephens' Incidents of travel in Yucatan is S149 (at p. 284). One might presume that this is being done to facilitate the insertion of new books, but Smith accomplishes this by adding a letter after the appropriate numeration, such as C53a (see p. 54). Frankly, there is little excuse for not renumbering if one accepts that the second edition should represent the most up-to-date information available in the easiest to use format. <br /> <br />     More troubling is Smith's acceptance of later editions in his list without apparently seeking out the original works. Aaron Ward's Around the pyramids (W14, at p. 323) is a fourth edition, while Bayard Taylor's A journey to Central Africa (T10, at p. 298) is a tenth edition. It is difficult to believe that the author couldn't improve on these citations in a revised version of his work. Occasionally, the problem is not even apparent; Stephen Olin's Travels in Egypt (O16, at p. 221) is elsewhere identified as a third edition (see Martin R. Kalfatovik, Nile Notes of a Howadji (1992), at p. 135 [0363]). Stephens' Incidents of travel in Egypt (1837) (S147, at p. 284) was in fact first published two years earlier in London (see Kalfatovik, at p. 128 [0342a]). The original secondary title for William Wilkes Warren's Life on the Nile (W37, at p. 327) differs from that given by Smith (see Kalfatovik, at p. 212 [0589a]). And then there are the omissions .... <br /> <br />     A perusal of one book, Kalfatovik's Nile Notes of a Howadji (dealing with travellers' accounts of Egypt, and published by Smith's own publisher seven years prior to his revision) yields some fifty-eight titles of seemingly relevant works not listed by Smith (see Kalfatovik, at pp. 157-58 [0426a; 0426b], 159 [0429], 173 [0463], 174 [0467], 192 [0565], 197 [0538], 204 [0561], 209 [0581], 216 [0604], 226 [0632], 228 [0640a; 0640b], 236-37 [0672], 237 [0673], 240 [0682], 245 [0699], 246 [0702], 246 [0703], 249 [0712], 249 [0713], 254 [0729], 272 [0787], 275-76 [0802], 277 [0806], 280 [0819], 281 [0821], 281 [0824], 282 [0826], 284-85 [0834], 285 [0837], 285-86 [0838], 287 [0845], 288 [0849], 288-89 [0851], 289 [0852], 292 [0864], 294 [0872], 294 [0873], 294-95 [0874], 298 [0883], 299 [0886], 301 [0897], 303 [0902], 304-05 [0908], 305 [0909], 307 [0916], 307-08 [0917], 309 [0923], 311 [0929], 311 [0931], 311 [0932], 312 [0933], 312 [0934], 316 [0947a], 317 [0951], and 322 [0968]), almost half again the number of the new entries in the updated edition. Smith's work does not include items such as Sarah Barclay Johnson's Hadji in Syria (1858), nor is it clear that he has considered 19th century published accounts of whaling, which often include stops in South American or Pacific ports. <br /> <br />     All this aside, I have found Smith's work to be an excellent source for books dealing with 18th and 19th century American travel. An Index of Places (at pp. 357-76) will be of great assistance to those wishing to concentrate their researches (there is also an Index of Occupations at pp. 377-82). All bibliographies are, in some sense, works in progress, and one may hope that a 3rd edition of American Travellers Abroad will continue to improve upon former incarnations in this useful area of research. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-05-25

Unfortunately, this was not just any tree, but a near unique golden Sitka spruce in British Colombia's Queen Charlotte Islands, some 165 feet tall and over three hundred years old. The tree was sacred to the Haida tribe, who believed that it was a transformed youth  (see pp. 155-57). Hadwin, who subsequently perished while crossing Hecate Strait- or disappeared before his court date, depending upon which story you choose to believe (see pp. 159-81)- was ironically an environmentalist who wished to draw attention to the destruction of the region's forests. <br /> My pet peeve first. Where is a picture of the tree? It is inconceivable that no view of the book's subject, either before or after its felling, is available, and yet (with the doubtful exception of the picture on the cover) none of the sixteen pictures in the book deals with the object which \\"stands\\" at its epicenter. In a way, this absence is a fitting symbol for the larger work. There is no question that Mr. Vaillant can write; he brings logging alive in a way that lesser craftsmen could not. We find out why the Queen Charlotte Islands are termed the \\"Canadian Galapagos\\" (at p. 28) at the same time that British Colombia is referred to as the \\"Brazil of the North\\" (at p. 100). We are introduced to a specialized argot, with terms such as \\"nurse logs\\" (at p. 8), \\"spruce flats\\" (at p. 16), \\"logger's smallpox\\" (at p. 76), \\"highballing\\" (at p. 77), \\"widowmakers\\" (at p. 129), and \\"pig's ears\\" (at p. 132). Vaillant, not content with this \\"forest\\" of information, discusses ecological problems, Haida culture, and intercultural relations. The void left by the fall of the Golden Spruce, however, is paralleled by a lack of in-depth information about Grant Hadwin. While Vaillant appears to have made, well, valliant efforts to interview those connected with the incident and indeed acknowledges \\"those members of the Hadwin family  who shared their memories and insights with me\\" (at p. [xi]), no specific citations appear to be listed in the Endnotes (see pp. [243]-50). This lack of information prevents us from more fully understanding Hadwin and his motive, and that in turn leaves only a gap in space where the real object once existed. <br /> The Golden Spruce should be read both for the information it imparts and for the quality of Vaillant's prose. Ultimately, however, it does not break the log-jam of facts and speculations surrounding this hopefully unique (but see pp. 140-41, 213) occurrence. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee	2005-05-25

Johnson comp	This collection of stories about people in Rappahannock Co., Virginia, is based on two hours of tapes made by the author in December, 1969. \\"The stories here are only the tip of the iceberg of the wealth of those told in the county, and a number of amusing incidents have occurred since 1969 .... [A]lthough I have tried to reconstruct some from notes my husband made on little scraps of paper, we never did get back to recording any more\\" (at p. i). None of the tales in the pamphlet appear to date from the 1970's or 1980's, so the reader must draw his or her own conclusions about reliability, although it must be said that the tone of all the stories appears fairly consistent. Johnson notes that \\"[i]n most cases actual names have been used\\" (at id.), and it is indeed possible to identify the Tony and Wafie (Hiawatha) Terry mentioned (at pp. 22-23) with sons of Caroline Terry mentioned in James D. Russell's Beyond the Rim: From Slavery to Redemption in Rappahannock County, Virginia (2003; see pp. 37, 40-42, 45-47). <br /> <br />     Johnson, born in 1904 (see p. 1), offers a number of stories \\"collected over the years\\" (at id.), which- to a certain extent- help us to better understand the county's social history in the first half of the 20th century. We are told about one individual who made several trips by \\"hopping a freight\\" (see p. 7), and another who disrupted telephone service by keeping his receiver in a box (at p. 13)! Another trickster managed to keep lubricated during World War II by collecting whiskey ration books when the speaker at a Baptist camp meeting elaborated on the evils of drink (at p. 21). Throughout all these stories run the authentic voices of the people; Episcopalianism is described as \\"religion ... in a damned mild form\\" (at p. 4), while a child is described as \\"'hanging over that fence like some garment or other'\\" (at p. 8). Those who assumed that \\"3 Dog Night\\" was an Australian expression may be interested in Dido, who \\"judged the weatherby the number of dogs he had to pile on his bed\\" (at p. 2). Local nicknames are described (at id.) and several ingenious tricks used by Confederate deserters are reported (at pp. 10-11). My two personal favorites are the story about the woman who, when asked if she had poultry, replied, \\"`I did have some, but the darned chickens ate it all up'\\" (at p. 10) and the allegedly true story of the Baptist who avoided being \\"unchurched\\" for dancing by successfully pleading that \\"'I had had a few drinks and just didn't know what I was doing'\\" (at p. 12). <br /> <br />     While one could wish for more material, we owe Elisabeth Johnson a debt for preserving her husband's memories of the county. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-05-25

[Stoneberger's] unique and colorful writing style, including his vocabulary, word usage, sentence structure, and so forth\\" (at id.). While Stoneberger died after the first rough edit, the resulting collection is one of which he could have been truly proud. <br /> <br />     Memories is largely focused on Stoneberger's family and boyhood, thus it is only from the Preface that we learn of his hitch with the CCC and his subsequent career operating heavy construction equipment (at p. v). While one might have preferred a linked and amplified narrative, we should be grateful for what we have; Stoneberger had the gift of evoking pictures and his memories of life on Lewis Mountain in the pre-Shenandoah Park era are hard to beat. Sometimes he shows how outside events such as the courthouse shootout at Hillsdale (see p. 29) or the sinking of the Titanic (see p. 41) affected people in the region. Other descriptions convey an in-depth understanding of country practices that would be almost impossible to replicate today- the descriptions of butchering hogs (at pp. 45-49) and of driving a horse team up a steep mountain incline (at pp. 69-71) immediately spring to mind. Memories also preserves some wonderful/horrendous stories; the man who lost his pants killing a deer (at pp. 56-57), the black man forced to dance all night (at pp.78-79), and the boy who trained two large rattlesnakes to drag \\"logs\\" to his play sawmill (at p. 26). Occasionally there are references in passing (riding the freights to apple pickings; at p. 16), or sometimes only a cryptic comment (why was John Scott Roche known as \\"the mountain prophet\\"?; at p. 6). While most of the stories relate to the Stonebergers, the Roches/Roaches, and the Lams, readers with no mountain ancestry will appreciate this unique insight into the region's culture. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee	2005-05-25

White, a minister of the Church of God in Christ, and founder of God's Storehouse, a building filled with smoked hams, food, and clothing to be distributed to locals in need. Ada Holland, who had written articles on White for Ebony and Texas Magazine (see pp. x, 206, 213; incidentally, she donated most of the fees she received to God's Storehouse), provided him with tapes and a recorder, working the result \\"into a logical, readable form\\" (at p. xi). Although \\"done largely in his exact words,\\" Holland notes that \\"[m]any good incidents had to be eliminated, and others had to be condensed\\" (at id.). After reading No Quittin' Sense, one can only hope that the tapes have been preserved. <br /> <br />     What White gives us, with Holland's assistance, is a first rate autobiography, showing what it was like to grow up black in East Texas at the turn of the century. His eye for the apt phrase is remarkable; Lucille, his first wife, tells him, \\"'You know, Charley, even the rocks look pretty,'\\" when they clear their land (at p. 107), while only someone with a heart of stone could fail to be moved by the description of her new kitchen furniture: <br /> <br />          Lucille was so proud of her new safe she could hardly leave it alone. She rearranged her things in it nearly every evening. Once, when she didn't know I was watching, she pushed her drawer in and out several times and didn't put anything in it or take anything out. Then she opened the doors and shut them a time or two, and run her hand over the smooth wood, just as gentle like. She never did know I seen her (at p. 111). <br /> <br />     Any description of black life at that place and time would be interesting; it is our good fortune that Rev. White is a master raconteur. We are given descriptions of a creek baptism (at pp. 3-4), hog butchering (at p. 24), laying out a corpse with a saucer of salt on its chest and silver dollars on its eyes (at p. 69), and of an extramarital affair at a schoolhouse (at pp. 100-01; Rev. White was the custodian at the time). We learn about  \\"stick and cat\\" chimneys (at p. 28), using old hornets' nests for gun wadding (at pp. 51-52), and the Reverend can almost make you taste his mother's biscuits (see p. 66). The reader moves seamlessly from C.C. White's childhood, when he shows early signs of his vocation by baptizing sticks and burying Old Poke, his doll (at pp. 5, 11), through the building of his storehouse for tithes (at pp. 166-67), to race relations in Texas in the 1960's (\\"'They may beat a man half to death trying to make him confess something he never done, but they've always let him vote'\\"- at p. 212).  <br /> <br />     This book offers a window into a world that has now largely disappeared. You don't have to be religious to enjoy No Quittin' Sense. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee	2005-05-25
US	44549820	RGIDL1Q5AMYGC	0895872366	762712581	Duck: An Outer Banks Village	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Judith D. Mercier, Duck: An Outer Banks Village (2001)	Judith Mercier is an author with unquestioned command of the apt phrase. Although Duck: An Outer Banks Village reads like a high-end magazine article, there is no evidence that Mercier has previously published any of this material. As early as her introduction, Mercier sets the book's tone: <br /> <br />Duck remains a place worth knowing. Its people are worth meeting, its heritage worth guarding. Stories are what bolster the spine of this coastal community, an old village bent but not yet broken. For that reason alone, these are stories worth telling (at pp. xi-xii). <br /> <br /> One finds it hard not to like phraseology such as: \\"A coat of simplicity has been brushed over every million-dollar deal, a homey quaintness hammered into each joist and floorboard\\" (at p. 36) or reference to blacks who \\"concealed whatever blues and bitterness they felt as cleverly as bootleggers hid their liquor\\" (at p. 105). That this glowing prose is combined with numerous facts about Duck and its environs should make for a rich mix, and it does. <br /> What tempers enthusiasm about Duck, and to my mind makes it a \\"very good\\" rather than a \\"great\\" read, is the general treatment of references. Mercier says, for example, that Suzanne Tate's Bring Me Duck (1986), \\"provided insights and reading pleasure\\" (at p. 256), but this is tepid praise for what appears to be a major precursor to her own work. Mercier's comments about Lewis Scarborough (at p. 162) and Ruth Scarborough Tate (at p. 169) reflect material already published in Bring Me Duck (see pp. 28-29, 5), while the quote from Tate about \\"cripple-ducking\\" (at p. 170) is directly taken, without attribution, from Bring Me Duck (see p. 6). The superstition about sweeping sand out of doors at sundown is found in both books (at pp. 196-97; see also Bring Me Duck, at p. 6), while other examples could be added. Indeed, readers of Bring Me Duck may regret that even more of Tate's work was not utilized in Duck. <br /> At the same time it is clear that Mercier has done a lot of research on her own. While it's frustrating that no bibliography lists articles from the \\"dozen mainland journalists and travel writers [who] have dropped in on Levin [Scarborough]\\" (at p. 41- or sources for the quotes at pp. 50-51), materials such as Frank Scarborough's cooked sea gull story (at pp. 149-51) are almost certainly appearing in print for the first time. <br /> Details such as the 600 canvasback killed in a day (or the 892 ruddy duck shot in less than ten hours in 1905- see p. 166) give us glimpses of a community now dominated by condominiums and tourists- although the contemplated Food Lion mentioned (at pp. 241-45) does not appear to have been built (personal observation in Duck; May 2005). Duck: An Outer Banks Village, is a lyrical introduction to the town and its social history, providing a worthy and informative read for summer visitors and Bankers alike. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee	2005-05-25

Blair, Tragedy at Montpelier: The Untold Story of T	Whoever said \\"the pen is mightier than the sword\\" had never read Tragedy at Montpelier. This 122- page book is an account of the execution of ten deserters from the Third North Carolina Regiment at Montpelier, Virginia in 1863. Blair spends the first thirteen pages dealing with Montpelier and its most famous owner, James Madison. This is fair enough, as is the account that follows of the Civil War and the activities of the Third North Carolina (at pp. 15-56). While Blair's writing is at its best in this section, her organization could be improved. She first discusses the Battle of Gettysburg at page 17, follows this with an account of the engagement's consequences (at pp. 17-18), and returns to refight the battle in more detail at pages 23-56. Similarly, Charlie Futch of the Third North Carolina dies once (at pp. 36-37), and is then dying again at page 54. It is not until about halfway through the book (at p. 57) that the desertion, the engagement with regular Confederate forces near Scottsville that took the life of Richardson Millett (see pp. 78-79), and the subsequent trial and execution really begin to be addressed. <br /> <br />     While Blair's description of the action at Gettysburg is excellent, if a bit hard to follow at times, the rest of the book does not live up to this section. There are, for example, near repetitions. \\"I am an interpreter at Montpelier and as such receive many questions. One of the most asked question [sic] is `What happened here during the Civil War?'\\" (at p. i). \\"As an interpreter at Montpelier, one of the most frequently asked question [sic] I receive is what happened here during the Civil War\\" (at p. 1). On page 58, \\"the citizens of Orange County, once again, opened their hearts and their homes to the men\\" and then, in what must have been an effusive display of politeness, \\"[t]he local citizenry opened up their hearts to the men\\" two pages later (at p. 60). And then there are the errors..... \\"gapping [sic] and painful wounds\\"(at p. 18), \\"[f]igures for the Confederate army is [sic] non-existent\\" (at p. 103), and my personal favorite, \\"John Futch was insoluble\\" (at the death of his brother, Charley, at p. 54). Nor are these the only examples. We are given \\"the below information\\" (at p. 107), and on the same page are told that \\"[I]n the majority of the cases, no family or friends to claim them except this writer\\" (at p. 107). Excuse me? And the list goes on .... <br /> <br />     This is not to say that Ms. Blair's book is without merit- it is clear that she has done significant research on the Montpelier executions. She does a good job of conveying the changing Confederate attitude toward desertions (see pp. 72-77) and it was interesting to find that each of the executed soldiers was buried with his face down; \\"[s]ince the deceased turned his back on his comrades and deserted, he would thus spend eternity with his back to the world\\" (at p. 96). Blair does not, however, list the monographs she cites at pages 21-22 and page 97 in her section on \\"Articles and Manuscripts\\" (see p. 119). While her book topic is one of some interest, what this volume needed (and did not receive) was a thorough vetting and proofing. In the absence of these corrections, the most dedicated Civil War buff must be excused if he goes AWOL. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee	2005-05-25

It covers the cultural remains of those who lived in the area before their removal for the Park and is beautifully illustrated with pictures of abandoned homesteads (at pp. 13-24), artifacts (at pp. 29-42), cemeteries (at pp. 46-55), and other signs of human habitation (at pp. 61-68). It is clear that the authors invested many hours in locating and photographing these remains, which in their way compare favorably with those from the better-known western ghost towns (see, for example, Lambert Florin's Ghost Towns of the West (1992)).<br /><br />  What this book does not offer, however, is any map to help locate the more than three hundred sites (see p. 71), including scores of cemeteries (see p. 11), that the Reeders have located in the course of their researches. Nor are locations given for any of the sites or cemeteries photographed. One can understand a desire to protect artifacts from vandals or collectors (indeed my copy of this work had not one, but two notices inserted, stating that removal of items from the National Park is a violation of federal law). If locating the surviving homesteads and cemeteries for readers, however, is considered deleterious to the structures' continued survival, one is hard-pressed to imagine a rationale for publishing this work. Education would seem to be the surest form of protection, and if providing maps to the sites is considered too dangerous, one might at least have expected the Reeders to identify former owners when they could or give general locations for the pictures taken to be of lasting value (many photographs in their Shenandoah Heritage (1978), for example, are identified by county or sometimes by more specific locations). Without such locators, photographs are much like artifacts wrenched from their stratigraphic context; a great deal of their value is lost. Quotes are given without attribution on pages 19 and 23, and there are no pictures of the representations of homes or automobiles mentioned as being chiseled in some rocks (see p. 60).<br /><br />  At the same time, Shenandoah Vestiges makes one want to be up and about in the Park. The Reeders give useful hints about their techniques for finding cultural vestiges (see pp. 12, 45) and note the use of non-native flora to identify homesites (see p. 59). The Reeders also have an excellent grasp of local ethnology- it was particularly interesting to learn that when families \\"left the Park area they were not allowed to take any parts of their buildings or fences from their farms. The government planned to recycle these materials in the homesteads being built for families who lacked the resources to relocate on their own\\" (at p. 67).<br /><br />  We are left with an interesting book, produced by knowledgeable authors, which, ironically, suffers from the lack of closer connections with the land about which it is written.<br /><br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee	2005-05-25

Ballard, Discussing the Peculiar Institution: Ass	This twenty-eight page unpaginated pamphlet deals with antebellum slavery in Page and Rockingham Counties. Ballard gives no bibliography, but does offer sources for his information in the Endnotes (at pp. [21]-[24]; pp. [25]-[28] are blank). <br /> <br />     Ballard's monograph challenges the idea that only a few blacks lived in the central Shenandoah Valley in pre-Civil War times (at p. [12]) and calls into question John W. Wayland's view of a Germanic Valley antislavery culture (see pp. [1]-[3]). Unfortunately, Ballard conflates the titles of Wayland's works as Histories of Rockingham and Shenandoah Counties (at p. [1]; as his endnote at p. [21] indicates, the correct titles are A History of Rockingham County, Virginia and A Short History of Page County, Virginia), which could lead to confusion for the cursory reader. The twenty pages of text have at least one sentence fragment (\\"A factor that  ...\\"; at p. [4]), and one typo (\\"Tewnty\\"; at p. [8]). <br /> <br />     What Ballard does do, is to indicate the importance of slaves for working iron furnaces (see p. [4]) and to demonstrate their ownership by \\"the largest and wealthiest landowners, millers, farmers, professional men, and ... iron makers of Page and Rockingham Counties\\" (at p. [10]). Ballard discusses The Narrative of Bethany Veney A Slave Woman (1889), an important autobiographical source for slavery in the region (see pp. [13]-[19]; he does not note that this is reprinted in the same Page County Heritage Association series as Aunt Betty's Story: The Narrative of Bethany Veney A Slave Woman (1998)). A particularly interesting tidbit concerns the rouse used by blacks to hinder their sale (at pp. [16]-[17]). Ballard also utilizes other sources on antebellum blacks in Page and Rockingham counties, and reproduces an interesting account of the Valentine's Day, 1842 murder of John Wesley Bell by his slaves (see pp. [14]-[15]). <br /> <br />     Although short, Ballard's work provides a useful introductionto slavery in the area and is an important starting point for those desiring to do further research on the topic. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-05-25

(at pp. 99-134), and a compilation of accounts from Chinese beggar boys at the Adullam House (n.d., published as H.A. Baker, Visions of Heaven (n.d.)) (at pp. 137-45). (Liardon also refers to Kenneth A. Hagee, I Believe in Visions (1984) and Jessie Duplantis' Heaven: Close Encounters of the God Kind (1996), as well as books by Lester Sumrall and Norvel Hayes (see p.21), although none of these are assessed at any length.)         None of the accounts herein resemble Dante's Paradisio, perhaps not surprisingly considering the Protestant background of the authors. More disturbing, however, are the variations between authors. Are the \\"Pearly Gates\\" of pearl (see p. 25) or jasper (see pp. 77, 139)? Are the streets paved with gold (see pp. 28, 139), pearl (see p. 100), or marble and precious stones (see p. 120)? And to the degree that the details differ, how much can the full accounts be trusted?         Ironically, the most thoughtful part of this book is Appendix A (at pp. 153-62), which discusses these and other questions about Heaven from a Biblical perspective. I do not agree with every answer that Liardon reached, but feel that this important Scriptural evidence should not have been relegated to the back of the volume. While the author does offer some background for understanding visions (at pp. 16-20), his work would have been much more powerful had he explained why accounts were included- or excluded- and provided an evaluation of the \\"insights\\" offered by the various visitors. As it is, unless someone provides a more comprehensive and critical approach to the question, Iguess we'll just have to wait and see.    Samuel Pyeatt Menefee	2005-04-25

Logs & Moonshine is the only one of Tate's four oral histories (see also Bring Me Duck, Memories of Manteo, and Whalehead) to be set on the North Carolina mainland. Over a third of the booklet's forty-eight pages are taken up with pictures showing Buffalo City in its heyday (at pp. 10, 14, 22, 26, and 32-45), as well as what now remains (at pp. 46-48). A map (at pp. 24-25) sketching one resident's memory of the city, circa 1929, is also of use. <br /> <br />     Tate has interviewed six of Buffalo City's former residents to obtain a picture of community life in the first half of the 20th century. The ghost town, formerly christened \\"Moonshine Capitol of the World\\" (at p. 5) was located west of Manns Harbor, North Carolina (at p. 3). Not surprisingly, many of the reminiscences deal with the production and sale of illicit spirits (see pp. 8-9, 12, 15-16, 20, and 27). Some of the earliest inhabitants of the town were Russian lumber-workers, who were brought over on contract (at p. 6). The town was segregated, with blacks living in white houses and whites in red dwellings (at pp. 6, 31). Workers were paid in company coins, redeemable at the company store (at pp. 6, 31, 33). The reminiscences describe the removal of the town's only telephone line (at pp. 6-7), use of sugar sacks to make dresses and sheets (at p. 12), burning tires to discourage bugs (at p. 18), and the old pole road (at p. 19). Particularly interesting is the account of William Basnight's prediction of television and atomic power (at p. 31). <br /> <br />     This is a useful account of a community that no longer exists, and Tate should be commended for her collection and preservation of this social history. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-04-25

The author and a friend, Evey Muggleton (now Evey Muggleton Heckman) smuggled scriptures into Albania during a ten-day tour of that country in 1973. Apprehended, they were threatened, interrogated, and expelled. <br /> <br />     Although interesting, the story does not, to my mind, match others in the International Adventure series in either the extent of the Christian service described (see Peace Child, A Cry From the Streets, and Living on the Devil's Doorstep) or the perils undergone (see Imprisoned in Iran). Indeed, one wonders whether Joly's position as personal secretary to YWAM's founder, Loren Cunningham, played any part in the decision to publish this book (which might have been better as an article). <br /> <br />     Many lengthy quotes are not specifically ascribed to their source (see pp. 100-01, 148, 148-49, and 158-59) and some lectures are offered verbatim (see pp. 59-61, 62-64), even though there is no evidence that Joly kept a diary and Heckman's record was destroyed during the trip (see pp. 107-08). Nor does Joly's treatment, traumatic though it may have been, appear to rise to the level of the \\"imprisonment\\" she claims (see p. 160). <br /> <br />     This aside, the volume has useful insights into the smuggling of Christian literature into totalitarian countries and is a useful description of tourism in Albania in the 1970's. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-04-25

Originally published in 1988, the volume offers current updates to Floyd McClung's biography (at p.[202]), but does not explain why he left Amsterdam for Colorado in 1992 to found All Nations Institute, or why he assumed the pastorate of Metro Christian Fellowship, neither of which would appear to be following C.T. Studds' desire \\"to run a rescue shop/ Within a yard of hell\\" (see p. 201). It is certainly McClung's right to follow wherever God has called him, but some explanation of this mission change in the new edition might have been useful.<br /><br />  McClung's account of his Afghani experiences (at pp. 15-97) supplements the book he co-authored with Paul Conn, Just Off Chicken Street (1975) and provides a useful, if slightly external, view of the Hippy Trail which ran from Europe to India in the 1970's (see p. 22). Like so many earlier missionary accounts, the book is useful as an anthropological/sociological account as well as in a religious sense.<br /><br />  The second half of Living on the Devil's Doorstep (at pp.99-201) deals with the McClung ministry in Amsterdam. This was initially established to reintegrate converted travelers into Western society and to prepare Christian volunteers for the outreach process (at p. 97), but it led to a series of outreaches, including work in the city's red light district. Again, a unique view of this area is offered, although, as noted above, the story of this particular ministry remains incomplete.<br /><br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee	2005-04-25

That having been said, there are some disappointments in store for potential readers, most of whom will be perusing the book for insights into Hillerman's creative mindset. Hillerman does an excellent job of describing his childhood in Oklahoma, his World War II experiences, and his subsequent life as a college student and journalist. It is only about two thirds of the way through the book (at p. 251), however, that he seriously begins addressing the fiction which has made him famous. Furthermore, as Hillerman himself notes (see p. 321), only six books are discussed in any depth in the text: The Blessing Way (at pp. 266-73), The Fly on the Wall (at pp. 274-82), Dance Hall of the Dead (at pp. 283-88), The People of Darkness (at pp.294-98), Hunting Badger (at pp. 300-10), and Finding Moon (at pp. 311-17). All the others are discussed in more depth in an addition (at pp. 321-31), which to me was the most interesting part of the book. Why they were not treated in more depth at appropriate places in the text is never explained. <br /> <br />     The volume also has no index, so that it is not possible to trace themes without riffling through the book. Additionally, the bibliography of Hillerman's works lists two compilations, The Joe Leaphorn Mysteries and The Jim Chee Mysteries, but inexplicably leaves out a third, Leaphorn & Chee. <br /> <br />     One is left with the impression of a hastily-produced book, with a thoughtfully crafted and detailed account of Hillerman's early years supplemented by a more impressionistic, some might say spotty, conclusion. Hopefully Hillerman's health will give him a chance to return to the genre and produce and produce a more satisfying, definitive account of his life and work. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-04-25

Baumann, holding dual American/Swiss nationality, was falsely accused of espionage by the Iranians and jailed from January to March of 1997. Imprisoned in Iran seems to be an accurate reconstruction of these events and, unlike Joly's Tomorrow You Die (1997), Baumann does not appear to be over-sensationalizing his experience. As Floyd McClung indicates in a Foreward (at pp. 7-8), Baumann does not write as if he is a Christian hero, and his book is all the more effective for this. Similarly, it is clear that the author does not divide Iranians into the \\"saved\\" and the \\"unsaved\\"; his nuanced approach gives his prison memoir special credibility. <br /> <br />     While Imprisoned in Iran is particularly pertinent for its Christian perspective, it also serves as a useful account of the attitude of Iranians toward Westerners.

We can understand the work of missionaries like Hudson Taylor and Gladys Aylward, and perhaps the contribution of martyrs like Watchman Nee, but how did the house churches, with their multitude of devotees, poured forth from the crucible of Chairman Mao and his successors?  <br /> <br />     Freddie Sun's autobiography sheds important light on this subject. Accepting Christ as his Savior as a young man, Dr. Sun suffered censure and imprisonment under the Communists, but never renounced his faith. The Man in the Fiery Furnace is not only a first-hand account of the problems faced by a devout Chinese Christian during the Cultural Revolution, but a moving love story as well. (One hopes that in due course Dorothy Sun will produce her own autobiography.) <br /> <br />     Of the book's 199 pages, nine are devoted to some of the author's poetry (at pp-. [191]-99), while only seven pages (at pp. 180-86) cover his life in the United States since 1988. As Dr. Sun is still active as Director of Christian Aid's Chinese Division, it is hoped that when the political climate allows, he will produce a sequel on the breakout of Christianity in China over the last twenty years. Certainly few are as well-positioned to know the ins and outs of this groundswell for God. My only quibble with the present work concerns the cover illustration; I have yet to determine what seems to be an illustration of the Li River near Xingping has to do with the text. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-04-25

As in Tate's other works, the final (sixteen) pages of this forty-eight page work consist of pictures, which might better have been placed throughout the book at appropriate locations. <br /> <br />     Whalehead's written contents consist of stories offered by Norris Austin, Corolla's Postmaster for twenty-eight years. Many of these memories came from his father, John, who served in the same position from 1935-59. Not only were these men central to Corolla's life, but Norris was the town's oldest living resident. In addition to telling the story of Corolla and Whalehead's names (at pp. 7,8), Tate's work includes accounts of clearing away the wildfowl that crashed blindly into the Corolla Light during winter (at p. 8), the covering of certain areas by the sand (at p. 10), and a lightning strike on a spelling bee (at p. 11). Subjects as diverse as community taunts and fights (at p. 14), the addition of perch to rain-barrels in order that the fish might eat mosquito larvae (at id.), and the rural sport of \\"tailing the cows\\" (at p. 15) are covered. Tate writes of persimmon battles (at p. 16), the use of local beaches as thoroughfares (at p. 19; see also pp. 30-31), a \\"rag\\" in which the local mail cart was transported to the roof of the church (at p. 19), and the breaking of tusks off wild hogs (at p. 28). Several reminiscences cover the Whalehead Club (at pp. 21-23), which is still a local landmark. Austin also touches on supernatural topics such as spectral ships (at p. 10), trickster tales showling how locals avoided Union soldiers (at p. 17) or the draft (at p. 25), and reports of strange submarines on local beaches (see p. 24). The vulnerability of the area is emphasized both by accounts of World War II attacks on the Merchant Marine (at p. 29) and by the war games subsequently staged on the Outer Banks (at pp. 29-30). <br /> <br/>     Tate's account is a useful addition to the history of the area; her efforts have ensured that these tales are no longer in danger of being lost (see p. 5). <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-04-25

Interestingly, of all the subjects of these volumes, Loren Cunningham is the only one still living. One wonders to what extent his inclusion in this group is due to the fact that he founded YWAM in the early 1960s, and whether the volume might not have been more appropriately placed in YWAM's International Adventures series, all of which deal with contemporary missions work. <br /> <br />     Loren Cunningham offers a bibliography (at p. 219) noting Cunningham's own works (co-authored with Janice Rogers)- Is That Really You, God? (1984), Making Jesus Lord (1988), and Daring to Live on the Edge (1991). Several of the people and events covered in other YWAM books are also mentioned in passing. The refitting of the Anastasis (see pp 182-84), for example, is treated in Jeannette Lukasse's A Cry in the Streets (2002), while Floyd McClung's work in Amsterdam (see p. 190) is covered in greater depth in McClung's Living on the Devil's Doorstep (2001). <br /> <br />     The Benges' book serves as a useful biography of Cunningham's life to date. The subject has had an undeniable impact on missions in the latter part of the 20th century and this work is accessible to both juveniles and adults. Like most works in the hagiographic tradition, its focus is on the positive, and the fact that it is published by YWAM could raise questions as to its impartiality. While the definitive biography of Loren Cunningham's life has yet to be written, the fact that the Benges were not content to rely exclusively on secondary materials, but went to the trouble to interview their subject (see p. 219), means that their work will play a role in any subsequent discussion of YWAM's founder. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br /> <br />      <br />	2005-04-25

It contains a bibliography citing Alan Burgess' The Small Woman (1957) and Phyllis Thompson's A Transparent Woman (1972), but does not mention Gladys Aylward's Gladys Aylward: The Story of Gladys Aylward (1952), Cyril James Davey's Never Say Die: The Story of Gladys Aylward (1974), Mildred T. Howard's These Are My People: A Biography of Gladys Aylward (1984), Catherine Swift's Gladys Aylward (1989), and Janet & Geoff Benge's Gladys Aylward: The Adventure of a Lifetime (1998), to list only those books published prior to Wellman's work. Several works on other missionaries to China are also referred to (at pp. 203-04. See also p. 23). <br /> <br />     Despite the drawbacks of his bibliography, Wellman has done an excellent job of covering Aylward's life. Far from being a standard \\"cut-and-paste\\", this biographical account shows an impressive grasp of the ins and outs of British domestic service, life in China at the time, and Far Eastern politics, all of which are imparted without stemming the flow of this book. While the biography appears to be intended for juveniles, adults can equally benefit from its account of Aylward's missionary endeavors. <br /> <br />     The account of the movie made of Aylward's life is particularly interesting. \\"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness\\" was based on the actual Inn of Eight Happinesses, which Aylward helped run at Yangcheng (see p. 197). Similar economics resulted in her adopted child Ninepence being rechristened Sixpence in the movie (at id.). While one can understand why this and other names might have been changed for privacy's sake, it is less clear what the love scenes and tampering with history accomplished (see pp. 197-98). Wellman presents a cautionary tale in miniature of what contact with the film industry can produce.  <br /> <br />     Despite concerns about the bibliography, this is an excellent account of Aylward's life and should serve as a benchmark for other books in the series. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />      <br />	2005-04-25

It is one in a series of monographs put out by the Great Smoky Mountains Natural History Association (including The CCC in the Smokies, Churches of the Smokies, Gristmills of the Smokies, Historic Buildings of the Smokies, and Logging in the Smokies). The book lacks not only a bibliography for further reading, but more critically, any map to show where the nine cabins covered (out of twenty historic log homes found in the Park- see p. 5) are located. Nor is it clear why coverage of the entire set of buildings was not possible, as pamphlets such as The CCC in the Smokies are significantly longer. One is sure that Aurora Foods (makers of Log Cabin Syrup) who sponsored the booklet and funded restoration of key cabins in the Park and elsewhere, would have sprung for the difference. <br /> <br />     For a fourteen-page work, however, Daniel does very well, noting the differences between single pen, dog-trot, and saddlebag design (at p. 3), and defining such terms as \\"granny holes\\" (at id.) and \\"Elijah room\\" (at p. 13). Park Historian David Chapman has noted that Great Smoky Mountain National Park \\"has one of the largest collections of historic log buildings in the world.... The quality and variety of buildings ... makes it a very significant collection\\" (at p. 3). The buildings surveyed were built or lived in by some of the over 1,200 families who had to sell their homes when the Park was established (at p. 4), and Daniel notes the toll taken by vandalism (see pp. 4, 8).Houses treated include the Baxter Cabin (at pp. 5-6), the Bales Cabin (pp.6-7), the Cook Cabin (pp. 7-8), the Davis-Queen House (pp. 8-10), the Noah \\"Bud\\" Ogle Cabin (pp. 10-11), the Henry Whitehead Cabin (p. 11), the John Oliver Cabin (pp. 12-13), the Elijah Oliver Cabin (p. 13), and the Walker House (p. 14). In all these cases, information about the people who lived in the building is offered in addition to a description of the building, enabling the reader to better visualize life on the homestead. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br /> <br />      <br />	2005-04-25

Howard, Covered Bridges of Virginia: A Guide (1999	This forty-eight page book is one of a series dealing with covered bridges of various regions (including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Bennington County, Vermont, and Madison County, Iowa). The title, however, is misleading. In his preface, Howard notes that \\"[I]n the early years of our country wooded bridges numbered in the hundreds in the Virginia countryside,\\" (at p. 5), adding that, \\"[I]n the mid 1930's, Virginia still had some 50 covered bridges\\" (at id.). Howard's book, however, confines itself to surviving structures, and then states that \\"[p]rivately owned bridges are not included in this guide\\" (at id.). One could wish that the author had been more inclusive, particularly since the difference would have meant covering three more bridges, Links Farm Bridge and C.K. Reynolds Covered Bridge in Giles County and Biculer Farm Bridge in Rockingham County (see &lt;[...]>). <br /> <br />     A more serious mistake, however, is that while the author covers Means Bottom Bridge (at pp. 23-26), Bob White Bridge (at pp. 27-30), Jack's Creek Bridge (incorrectly identified as \\"Jack's Bridge\\" in the Contents at p. 7- see pp. 31-34), and Humpback Bridge (at pp. 40-44), the fifth bridge included is the destroyed Marysville Bridge (at pp. 35-39). If this span is, if you will pardon the pun, \\"covered\\", there would seem to be no reason for omitting other destroyed bridges about which information exists, including the Shenandoah Bridge at Harper's Ferry and the covered bridge across Rock Castle Creek (see &lt;[...]>). Howard's major omission, however, is his failure to cover Sinking Creek Bridge in Giles County, built about 1916 (WG 46-35-01 in the identification system which Howard adopts), and covered by both websites noted herein. In a book with such restricted coverage, this qualifies as a serious error. <br /> <br />     Lesser problems with the volume include a poor map (at p. 45) indicating the location of surviving public-access bridges (although better written directions on how to get there are given under the relevant locations) and general tips for photographing the spans (at pp. 10-11), although with only four surviving bridges being covered, more informative personalized directions on photography might have been offered, such as those in Andrew Hudson's Photo Secrets San Diego (n.d.). Not surprisingly, Howard does not refer to Leola B. Pierce's later work, Covered Bridges in Virginia (2002), dealing with the same topic, nor does the list of \\"Covered Bridge Societies\\" (at p. 46) include the Covered Bridge Society of Virginia, Inc. (see &lt;[...]>). <br /> <br />     All this having been said, there are parts of this volume to recommend it. An introduction discusses the question of why bridges were covered (at p. 9), in addition to considering what woods were used (at pp. 9-10) and the types of trusses involved (at pp. [13]-19). Each of the five bridges covered has a useful discussion of its history, although these are not necessarily complete; while Howard states that all of these spans are included in the National Register of Historic Places (at p. 5), only the section on the Humpback Bridge gives a date of nomination (at p. 41). The bridges discussed are accompanied by a number of useful photographs illustrating their appearance. <br /> <br />     Howard's book may therefore be considered a useful, if limited, source on covered bridges in the state. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-04-25

Jolley, The CCC in the Smokies (2001)	This booklet is a very useful, if short, introduction to the operations of the Civilian Conservation Corps in Great Smoky Mountains National Park during the 1930's and early 1940's. Part of a series put out by the Great Smoky Mountains Natural History Association (including Churches of the Smokies, Gristmills of the Smokies, Historic Buildings of the Smokies, Log Cabins of the Smokies, and Logging in the Smokies), Jolley's twenty-page work appears to be the only monograph specifically written about the CCC and its role in the Park. This makes the lack of any bibliography more understandable, if regrettable. <br /> <br />     Several sidebars enhance the value of the work, including criteria for CCC enrollment (at p. 4), a typical workday (at p. 7), and doggerel by one of the workers (at p. 9). Pertinent illustrations from National Park Service archives are scattered throughout Jolley's book. He treats the CCC in the Park from its establishment in 1933 (see pp. 3,4) as an extension of Franklin Roosevelt's New York conservation project (see p. 4) until its closure in 1942 (see p. 19). Jolley is excellent at picking out descriptions, such as those of arriving recruits (at pp. 5-6) and describes the Army influence on CCC workers (at p. 7) as well as the effects of bias and political graft (at pp. 7-8). He notes, for example, that African-Americans never worked in the Corps at the Park due to local attitudes (see p. 9). Some of the Corp's Park projects are illustrated (at pp. 10-11) and discussed (at pp. 12-14); indeed the Park had more CCC camps (twenty-two, according to p. 19) than any two other parks (see p. 12). Occasionally there are lapses, as when Horace Kephart is quoted without any further identification being offered (see p. 3. Kephart was the author of Our Southern Highlanders). Generally, however Jolley is master of his material. One of his best sections is on \\"Camp Life\\" (at pp. 14-20), which includes discussions of \\"deserters\\" (at p. 15), information on nicknames (at p. 18), and some survey of camp newspapers (at pp. 17-18). After the program's closure, some of the camps were turned into military posts or holding locations for conscientious objectors (at p. 20). <br /> <br />     This volume and others in the series make one wonder why a similar approach to information has not been tried for all the other National Parks. The CCC in the Smokies represents a valuable addition to the local history of the region. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-04-25

It offers a short (twelve page) history of gristmills in the Park, but has no bibliography, nor any map showing the location of current (or former) gristmills. <br /> <br />     The four surviving gristmills found within the Park are discussed, viz.: Mingus Mill (at pp. 4-8), Cable Mill (at pp. 8-12), Reagan Mill (at pp. 12-13), and Ogle Mill (at pp. 13-14). Strutin notes the central role corn played in breadmaking (at p. 3; he even includes a recipie for spoonbread at p. 11) and discusses the grain toll levied by millers (at p. 5) and the social import of mill days (at p. 7). He also covers the use of rot-resistant hemlock in millraces (at p. 5), the use of applewood, \\"which is hard enough to hold an edge without cracking\\", for gears (at p. 11), and the use of beef tallow- the longest-lasting animal fat- for greasing the gears. \\"Tub mills\\" are discussed (at p. 12) and Strutin tells about the use of \\"a `weaner' cabin for newlywed offspring\\" (at p. 13). <br /> <br />     The materials discussed are interesting, but one is left with the impression that almost anything is grist for the author's work. Only one of the pictures (at p. 3) is not contemporary, suggesting that Strutin has had to stretch the materials available to produce his twelve pages. When one is told that Cades Cove alone had four to five mills (at pp. 8-9), one wonders why the book was not extended to include the sites of former mills within the Park. <br /> <br />Samuel Pyeatt Menefee <br />	2005-04-25

There is no mention, however, of the window breaking, which led to Cousteau being sent off to school, while the statement that Cousteau was assigned to a ship in the Mediterranean to recuperate after his automobile accident (see p. 17), is not reflected in either Madsen's nor Munson's more thorough biographies, both of which merely state that he was assigned to the naval port of Toulon.  The account of the Undersea Research Group (more correctly, the Groupe d'Etudes et de Recherches Sous-Marines - or Group of Studies and Undersea Research) was established after the defeat of Germany, rather than during the war as Iverson's text suggests (see p. 30), while \\"the first undersea human colony\\" (at p. 47), mentioned as being built in 1963, was clearly Conshelf II - its prototype had been constructed in the Mediterranean the previous year.	2005-01-15

Russell, Beyond the Rim: From Slavery to Redemption	This book, by James D. Russell, is billed as a biography of Caroline Terry, an ex-slave who lived to the age of 108. The narrative \\"is based on Caroline's recollections of events as related to the author, her great-grandson, then a 12 year old boy ...\\" (at p. [ix]). Seventy years later, Russell has \\"re-created scenes and conversations consistent with Caroline's recollections as told to me\\" and has \\"used my imagination, and my understanding of black people's lives in those days, to create scenes and dialogue that fleshes out Caroline's life story ...\\" (at pp. [ix-x]). While this approach may improve readability, it detracts from the historical usefulness of the information conveyed, as it is not possible to tell what has been reorganized and what added. <br /> <br />     One sample of the problems which result is the coverage of \\"plantation children,\\" the issue of master-slave unions. While this practice has been documented elsewhere, Russell's account suffers from a failure to directly name the plantation owner (it appears to be a James A. Ryan or Rhine- see pp. 43, 55), as well as a confusion in dates. The Preface states that Caroline's son, Theodore, was born in 1858 and a daughter, Florence, in 1868 (at p. ix). In the text, however, Theodore's birth appears to occur in 1863 (see pp. 21-23), while Russell states that the Master's last visit to the cabin was in the spring of 1865 (at p. 28). Some may also be taken aback by the use of dialect (\\"' Heah ah is, Marse, I'se coming in now'\\"- at p. 2, for example), although I am willing to give Mr. Russell the benefit of the doubt on knowing how his great-grandmother talked. While accounts of \\"jumping the broom\\" (at pp. 34-35) and black music (at p. 41) are of interest, there is no way to tell whether they actually occurred or have been borrowed. <br /> <br />     Ironically, what really saves the book are the oral interviews concerning James Russell's own life in Sperryville (at pp. 69-90). While these have been edited, they represent an eloquent account of growing up black in segregated Virginia, and are just as interesting as, and less adulterated than, Russell's memories of Caroline Terry. <br />	2005-01-15

Westman does not mention boarding school in Alsace as do Munson and Madsen, and is the only source of which I am aware that mentions training at Stanislas College in Paris (at p.10).  Nor is there any evidence that \\"the navy sent . . . [Cousteau] to command its base in Shanghai, China\\" after his graduation from the naval academy in 1933 (at p. 11).  Perhaps understandably in a juvenile work the topic of Pierre Cousteau's collaboration with the Axis Powers is not alluded to; more surprising is Westman's identification of Cousteau as the inventor of the aqualung (at pp.3-18), even though the device's co-patentee, Emile Gagnon, is mentioned by name in the text.       The Roman wreck, which Westman discusses (at pp. 19-20) was searched for for six days (see Richard Munson, Cousteau, The Captain and His World, at pp.57-58) rather than explored for a similar period of time (see p.20).  \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" caused Maurice Fargues to pull an air hose from his mouth, rather than somehow pulling it from the diver's lips (see p. 27), while the unidentified \\"wealthy friend\\" who helped Cousteau purchase the Calypso (at p. 30) was Thomas Lowll Guiness (see Axel Madsen, Cousteau:  An Unauthorized Biography at p.64).  Westman also passes over in silence major events in the French oceanographer's life, including his book and award-winning film, The Silent World, and his appointment as Director of the Oceanographic Institute in Monaco.  He wastes almost a page discussing the loss of the Titanic (at p.41), before discussing its sister shipwreck, the Britannic, which Cousteau's crew investigated (a not inconsiderable detour in a book with only thirty six pages of text).  Westman also offers only a poor treatment of Atlantis (\\"Atlantis is famous in myth and legend.  Old records state that it sank into the sea thousands of years ago.  Many people have tried to find traces of the fabled island.  Cousteau's crew tried too, but they didn't find anything.  The undersea city is still a mystery\\" - at p. 42).  Finally, no source is offered for the astounding comment that, \\"[n]early half the life in the seas has been killed by pollution during Cousteau's lifetime alone\\" (at p. 44).	2005-01-15

Many of the cards have no actual or approximate date, which limits the value of the book as a reference work.  One could understand if it were not possible to place one or two views temporally, but the number of pictures lacking such information suggests a sloppy approach to the subject, particularly when other volumes in this series (such as Nelson Harris' Roanoake and Vintage Post Cards) do offer dates for all the cards shown.  Perhaps less excusable is what appears to be a mixing of pictures with postal views.  The young hiker (at p. 6), a woman with outstretched arms (at p. 8), the rocks depicted at p. 9, and possibly the Indian brave at (p.10) are but a few examples. (Cabins at p. 36, the CCC pictures at pp. 37-39, and the farm at p. 75 also seem suspicious.)  For a volume that is supposed to be about postcards, this appears to be a serious lapse.  Again, had these views been dated, questions about the pictures would have been less likely.   <br /> <br /> Frederick's introduction (at pp. 7-8) adds little to our understanding of the Park and its environs; fortunately, she does a better job on individual captions.  While some have criticized Frederick for her failure to explain the disruption to the lives of many when the Park was formed, she does touch on the matter (at pp. 26 and 55).  The picture of Luray Caverns (at p. 32) does not mention the major suit which decided their ownership (see Russell H. Gurnee's Discovery of Luray Caverns, Virginia), while the picture of the Foot Tunnel (at p. 59) states that information was updated \\"15 years later,\\" but does not give the original date of issue.  No explanation is given of the name \\"Limberlost\\" (at p.61), while a picture of dying trees makes the interesting observation that, \\"[c]hipmunks will use the rotting bases of tree trunks for protection from largeranimals, and certain species will deposit their eggs under loose pieces of bark\\" (!-at p. 66).  Finally, a card on p. 124 makes an obscure reference to \\"Culpepper [sic] in Warrenton\\" - in fact Culpeper is both a county and a county seat, while Warrenton is located in Fauquier County. <br />	2005-01-15

Another positive feature is the bolding of occasional pertinent vocabulary words, which are defined in a glossary in the back of the volume (see pp. 60-61).  The book offers suggestions for further reading (at p. 62), although these are of only moderate use.  The volume is written in a comprehendible, although slightly \\"slangy\\" (see \\"earned a bad rap\\" at p. 29), style, and is reasonably well illustrated with pictures of Cousteau and his researchers.   <br /> <br /> King's biography does cover Cousteau's prickly relationship with his sons (at p. 53) and his remarriage (at p. 57), although it does not mention the previous affair with his second wife, his brother Philippe's collaboration with the Axis during World War II, or indeed the stone-throwing affair of Jacques' youth, which led to expulsion from school.  The mistakes which do occur are fairly minor.  Cousteau met his first wife, Simone at a party in Paris, not in Toulon (see p. 14), according to both Richard Munson and Axel Madsen's more thorough biographies.  King's discussion of the bathyscaphe (at p. 27) ignores the earlier bathysphere, which had also been used to plumb the depths.  Nor does there seem to be any reason to have omitted 19th century vessels when speaking of times \\"when mariners did not have the sophisticated navigation equipment that sailors use today\\" (see p. 45).  Finally, to say that all the silver, gold and gems found on Silver Bank had been \\"plundered\\" (at p. 46) is to ignore Spain's extensive New World mining operations and distort the historical record. <br />	2005-01-15

Books	4	0	0	N	N	Suzanne Tate, Bring Me Duck:  Folktales and Anecdotes from D	A series of reminiscences by Ruth Scarborough Tate, presumably a relative of the author, furnish the core of this book.  Bring Me Duck is one of Tate's oral histories, which also include Whalehead, Memories of Manteo and Logs & Moonshine.  Slightly over a quarter of Bring Me Duck's forty-eight pages are pictures of Duck, which might have been scattered through the text to better effect.  The remaining thirty-three pages (there is also a one-page glossary of local terms - at p. 48) of reminiscences include local sayings (\\"`He's so tight he'd skin a louse for his tallow'\\" - at p.6) and the origin of personal nicknames (at pp. 8-10).  Ruth Tate talks about the hutches used to sweeten sweet potatoes (at p.11), pounds used to keep carp alive (at pp. 13-14), and   net-mending (at pp. 15-16).  She also reports pre-War rumors of German spies in the area (at p. 23), traditions of local witches (at pp. 23-24), and stories of pirates and buried treasure (at p. 24).  One tale concerns a lost Civil War safe from Baltimore allegedly dumped off Martin's Point Creek (at p. 26), and Tate is also informative about the practice of fire-lighting for swans (at p. 27).  Taken in sum, these stories are an interesting addition to information about the area and the book does a service in preserving them.	2005-01-15

While most of the high points are hit, important supplemental information is occasionally lacking; thus we are told that \\"[i]n 1973 Greensprings was named a National Landmark District\\" (at p. 8), but no mention is made of the fact that this was in part the result of a campaign to deter the mining of vermiculite in the county. <br /> <br />     It is clear that this volume attempts to straddle the divide between covering the town's history and that of the county around it. Of the book's six chapters, the first two are split between town-county coverage, while the last four deal exclusively with the town of Louisa. By my count, Mineral rates four pictures, Cuckoo- one, Bumpass- one, and Greensprings- only one. Other county locations have similarly scant representation, and one wonders why the book did not simply concentrate on doing a more thorough job of covering the town. <br /> <br />     The jacket blurb is incorrect in several assertions, although this is probably not Ms. Cooke's fault. While the book does contain \\"an impressive array of photographs,\\" it in no way can be said to be \\"[f]illed with local stories and  anecdotes\\" (jacket blurb). Similarly, none of the pictures are described as being \\"high school class pictures from the 1950s\\" and none document recent changes to the city or county (id.).  <br /> <br />     Monticello is not in Charlottesville, as stated on p. 17, and one Deputy Clerk of Court is variously identified as John Thomas (at p. 35) and John M. Thomas Jr. (at p. 39). The spelling of \\"Louise County\\" on the standard pint pot depicted ( at p. 13) is not explained, nor is the difference between the station sign \\"Frederick Hall\\" at Frederickshall (at p. 27). The photographs on p. 75 seem to bear no relation to the \\"Businesses\\" of the chapter, nor do other photos (at pp. 93, 100, and 102) have aught to do with \\"Residences.\\" Many pictures (such as those at pp. 46-48) have no approximate dates, while noting who took other photographs (see pp. 39 and 83) is probably more information than most readers need. Finally, the captions at pp. 78-79 and 86-87 would have been clearer if the relevant buildings had been identified by letters or numbers on the relevant photographs. <br />	2005-01-14

Basnight made \\"frequent visits to area schools to talk about her early life on Roanoke Island\\" (see &lt;[...]>) and the stories in this volume, arranged in a roughly chronological order, offer insights into early 20th century life on the island, from bootleggers (at 10), to the sight of the first airplane in the region (\\"'Young'uns, get under the house'\\" her mother ordered, \\"'[t]he Kaiser has sent the Germans to blow us all off the earth!'\\"- at p. 15), to those who thought a radio worked like a record player, and that songs could be \\"replayed\\" ( at pp. 20-21). While information on gathering mistletoe to be shipped to New York in barrels (at pp. 23-24) and the visit of the Show Boat in the 1930's (at p. 25) may be of interest to future social historians of the region, the volume's major interest lies in the reminiscences offered of The Lost Colony (at pp. 28-34), in which Basnight played the role of Agona for twenty-five years.  Almost the last third of the book (pp. 37-52) is devoted to pictures of Basnight's friends and family- perhaps a few too many illustrations under the circumstances. It is a pity that these could not have been incorporated in appropriate places in the work.	2005-01-14

This is a juvenile work which allegedly deals with the underwater explorations of William Beebe and Otis Barton. Of the thirty-nine pages of text, however, almost a quarter relates to post-bathysphere explorations. This includes not only the exploits of the Picards and the Trieste (at pp. 36-40), but also accounts of Cindy Lee Van Dover and Sylvia Earle (at pp. 34-35). The latter two are included under the rationale that Beebe and Barton inspired them, but there seems little doubt that their sex played a major role in their appearance here, as neither is stated to have been involved in a record-setting deep sea dive. Perhaps another clue to this grab-bag approach is the publisher website's statement that the series is aimed to appeal to \\"reluctant readers\\" (see [...] (visited Oct. 19, 2004)), but the lack of focus is shown in the dearth of background given by Matsen for both Beebe and Barton (at p. 7), and the fact that Barton's subsequent explorations of the depths are not considered.<br /><br />\\"Aquanaut\\" does not mean \\"deep water voyager\\" as stated at page seven, but merely refers to someone who travels in the water. Similarly, while round-offs are allowable in metric computations, 4.5 feet is given both as 1.4 m (at p. 9) and as 1.5 m (at p. 24). Some of the Fun Facts (at p. 25) could have been made more interesting; Matsen does not note, for instance, that the bait used to attract fish was a live lobster who survived the descent, or that Otis Barton was involved in filming Titans of the Deep. We are not told who broke the Beebe-Barton descent record in 1948 (at p. 28), while the Challenger Deep is said to be named \\"after a famous British ship\\" (at 38-39), with no reference to the vessel's importance for oceanographic exploration.<br /><br />Books which are listed in the chapter notes do not appear in Further Reading, nor is Barton's book listed in either section. Finally, while the ephemeral nature of internet websites is noted (at p. 2), the site reference forChapter 5, fn. 2 pulls up a useless screen.	2004-10-29

He was born in 1910. He has learned and taught about life underwater\\"- at p. 3). Ironically, the photographic captions require a higher level of reading; that on p. 9, for example, notes that \\"Jacques Cousteau would grow up to use machines, such as the windship Aleyone, and to make films of his exploits and underwater adventures.\\" One wonders whether words like \\"regulator\\" and \\"aqualung\\" are appropriate to the age group targeted, at least without further explanation. At least one photograph, that on page ten entitled \\"A French navy ship gives a 21-gun salute as it enters the harbor at Havana, Cuba\\" has nothing to do with Cousteau, while it seems foolish to identify Bernard Delmotte in a picture (at p. 31), but not to name the co-inventor of the aqualung (\\"A man in Paris helped him\\"- at p. 16). Similarly, many of the photographs are not parallel to the text. The account of an amphora wreck off Grand Conglove is illustrated by two statuettes found off Greece (at p. 23), while although wars and typhoons are mentioned in the text, the picture offered is that of the Calypso in a blizzard (at p. 34). <br /> <br />Greene incorrectly indicates that Cousteau did not help clear enemy mines after World War II (at p. 17), gives the wrong date for Philippe Cousteau's death (1979, not 1978), and confuses the aircraft involved with the accident which was a flying boat, not a helicopter (at p. 41). <br />	2004-10-29

DuTemple, Biography:  Jacques Cousteau	This biography of the French oceanographer is written for juveniles and has good pictures. Endnotes, found at pp. 106-07, refer to pages in the text (a fact not noted in the volume), while Madsen's good, but dated, biography appears here, but not in the bibliography. More problematic is the bibliography's use of websites. Unlike books, these are subject to change, and change they have. The site given for a list of Cousteau's videos, [...] , no longer exists, and only one video is listed at [...] . Similarly, [...] is now [...] . At least one of the endnotes, referring to Cousteau weeping when he heard news of the sinking of the Dupleix, gives an incorrect reference in The Silent World (it occurs on p. 34, not p. 31). <br /> <br />DuTemple gives a short treatment of Cousteau's romantic relationship and second family, but avoids any mention of his brother Pierre's collaboration with the Axis during World War II or of Jean-Michael's suit against Jacques over use of the Cousteau Society name. More worrisome in a book for students, the author states, \\"[i]n September 1939, France and Great Britain declared war on Germany\\" (at p. 29), adding later, \\"[t]hen Hitler rolled into Poland\\" (at p. 30), which indeed many of us thought was the reason for the declaration of war in the first place. <br /> <br />It is also interesting to compare DuTemple's assertion that Cousteau \\"and a group under his command dove under the ships of the French fleet, placing enough explosives to sink every ship. The fleet could be destroyed if necessary to prevent Hitler from using the ships\\" (at p. 32) with Axel Madsen's statement that, \\"Cousteau and the artillery specialists under his command were busy booby-trapping the whole fleet. Against whom they weren't quite sure. But bombs were placed aboard every ship ....\\" (see p. 36 in Madsen's book; emphasis added). <br /> <br />DuTemple incorrectly states the date of the founding of the Cousteau Society as 1973 rather than 1974. The chart on \\"The Evolution of Diving Gear\\" (pp. 34-35) fails to give credit to Otis Barton, who designed the bathysphere in which he and William Beebe plumbed the depths, and does not note that Cousteau actually knew Guy Gilpatrick when he lived at Cap d'Antibes. <br />	2004-10-29

Only one of these pictures rings false (at pp. 8-9; what are the chances of three divers being in a position where neither their hands nor feet show?). Reef does make mention of Jacques' brother's collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II, although his relationship with and subsequent marriage to Francine Triplet are ignored. Conshelf I-III are noted, but there are no references to the Cancellation of Conshelf IV and V or the abandoned Argyronete project. <br /> <br />The book occasionally has a tendency to \\"telescope\\" events in a way which, while not exactly incorrect, is misleading. Thus Daniel Cousteau's boss, Eugene Higgens, is mentioned, but Daniel's former employer, James Hyde, is not. Similarly, Reef's description of the testing of the aqualung (at p. 29) makes it appear that all this was done in a single day rather than over a longer period of time (see Axel Madsen, Cousteau: An Unauthorized Biography, at pp. 44-45). <br /> <br />Despite Reef's claim that \\"[o]ne day, Tailliez brought a pair of swimmer's goggles to the beach so they could see more clearly under water\\" (at p. 24), there is evidence to the contrary. Axel Madsen states that \\"[p]osterity would fail to ascertain who of the three new friends first brought goggles to the beach that summer\\" (see p. 21). Finally, it would have been more accurate when discussing Cousteau's film on Conshelf III to note that it debuted on television because of his failure to line up a distributor, as the helium in the Conshelf atmosphere made the voices of the aquanauts too squeaky (see DuTemple's book on Cousteau, at p. 86). <br />	2004-10-29

While the book is generally well-illustrated with photographs, one does wonder at the choice of a picture from Desert Storm rather than a more appropriate illustration of post- World War II mine-clearing operations (at p. 45). <br /> <br />Napoleon Bonaparte is mis-identified as an enemy of France (at p. 25), and Simone Cousteau's bolt to a caf to order a \\"stiff cognac\\" (see Alex Madsen's Cousteau: An Unauthorized Biography, at p. 57) becomes Simone sitting \\"alone and frightened in a caf waiting for word of her husband's fate\\" (at p. 52). Sinnott does not mention the reason Cousteau's film on Conshelf III became a television special (see DuTemple's book on Cousteau at p. 86) nor does she say anything about the cancellation of Conshelf IV and V or the Argyronete project. The power struggle between Philippe Cousteau and Jacques is not touched on, and one might wish for more on Cousteau's theory that a grouper swallowed the Biblical Jonah (at p. 106). <br />	2004-10-29
