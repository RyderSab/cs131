Covering the amazing achievements of one of the finest pitchers - woman or man - of all times, Jackie Mitchell, this picture-book biography is sure to fly off the shelves and engage even emerging readers, with it's intense, bright illustrations and cliff-hanging text. The story centers around Jackie's determination and hard work to become a great pitcher, fighting sexist discrimination and bad press.  It's a tale of what someone can do with their dream, and would be an inspiration to all young people, ballplayers or not.  The illustrations perfectly complement the text, and serve to make the story more intense and easy to relate to.  This would be a great read-aloud for any classroom or library story time, and might be used to inspire older children to write stories of times they persevered with their dreams.  Book has an author's note that lets kids know what happened to Jackie later on and a brief bibliography in the end papers.	2005-04-07

This biography is a work of art: it's tough to blend this much biographical data, anecdotes, photos, and clippings into a coherent and interesting story.  Yet, teacher-librarian-author Dublin has done just that; the book is engaging enough to pull in even reluctant young researchers.  Kids who are sports fans will find it particularly interesting and inspirational, as Rosenfeld was an amazing athlete who had a wonderful sense of humor, team work, and fair play. The text is rich in ethnic (Rosenfeld was a Russian Jew) and feminist themes, as well.  Book has T of C, timeline, suggestions for further reading, bibliography, and index.	2005-04-07

This fictional autobiography is a lively portrayal of Teddy Roosevelt's youngest daughter, Ethel. Young readers will be amused by the antics of this 'rough riding' first family and will empathize with Ethel's conflicting feelings about being a first daughter.  The story opens as T.R. receives a call in the night that McKinley had been shot, and we follow the family in their move to the 'dark and musty' White House, Ethel's enrollment at National Cathedral (boarding) School, and her joyous, tomboy visits home.  Bradley's meticulous researching is well-reflected in the text, but it never becomes bogged down in biographical data.  The dialogue is very well done, and characters and setting are rich in detail. It is a thoroughly enjoyable, engaging read for older elementary and younger middle school students and would be a wonderful read-aloud in a classroom studying US Presidents	2005-04-07

The plot feels dreamlike, and the wonderfully creative illustrations help maintain this milieu.  This would make a great read-aloud or read-alone for the younger set, with a bit of interpretive help on the terms like \\"guild\\" and \\"back to the drawing board\\".  This is a remarkable first book for the author, I can't wait to see what he comes up with next!	2005-03-03

Her vagabond mother left Dizzy and her father when she was only 4, and Dizzy is struggling with her loss and trying to recoup a mother-daughter relationship when her mother arrives on her birthday and takes her away to join her freespirited livestyle.  Her mother, \\"Storm\\" is a self-centered thrill-seeker who uses Dizzy and others and betrays their trust.  Written in Dizzy's voice, this book is funny and sweet and also manages to present a dismal picture of substance abuse and mental illness.  While the tone is juvenile and the plot somewhat predictable, the character development is rich and easy-to-relate to.  There is a good message in the text: that 'being real' is more important than thrills and that love prevails over all.  This book is a quick read and would engage youth grades 5 and up.<br /><br />BTW, some of the comments made by others make me realize that there are folks out there who don't know how common this sort of scenario unfortunately is.  It may be meth and not grass that the parents chase after, but Storm's  behavoir is all-too-common in our society with parents who breeze in and out of their children's lives as they enter and exit rehab and the revolving door of substance abuse.  While  Dizzy is more of a romp through hippie festivals, it would still be very easy for kids who do endure parental drug abuse to relate to the protagonist of this book and find solace in her story.	2005-03-03

The illustrations are bright and evocative, and the text is mnemonic and fun.  It takes us through a 'typical' day with a group of robot friends performing their specialized duties.  Uh-oh, it starts to rain and the wet robots short circuit, confusing tasks, for \\"When it comes to robot brains, nothing's worse for them than rain.\\"  They start fuddling up their work and decide they need to switch their heads, so they pop them off and trade them.  All ends well for the mixed-up group, proving that teamwork and flexibility are key to getting things done right.  There's a lot a teacher/parent could do with this book to inspire children's creativity: making colorful robot collages, designing robots for specialized functions, or creating 'mixups' with heads and bodies of different creatures/machines.  What fun!	2005-03-03

This has got to be one of the most creative, funniest kids' books I've read in a long time, chock full of puns metaphors, and allegories.  Henry, the protagonist, is \\"having a loud day\\", loud enough to wake the dead.  He does, and what follows is a Zombie romp through the town, searching for noisy Henry.  On the way, they visit a beautician ('dyeing' hair), librarian (who expects 'dead' silence), the post office clerk ( who refers them to the 'dead-letter' section) and have lots of other deadpan adventures.  Kwas' watercolor and ink illustrations are perfect - not cute, but not grisly, funny but not distracting from the text.  It's obvious that the author and illustrator had fun in collaborating on this book and I hope they do it again and again, what a great duo!  The publisher indicates on the end papers that this book is suitable for ages 4 through 8, but I think it has wider appeal.  I could see teachers using this book to help teach about similies, metaphors, allegories, etc.; it would be a splendid book to use at Halloween or during the Days of the Dead.	2005-03-03

Odd thing about this tale is that it is a dill pickle and an Antarctic penguin who forge the friendship.  If this wasn't enough of a lesson in tolerating diversity, the Pickle is a wealthy talk-show host on TV and the Penguin is just some bored bird who wants a change from all his 'fish and ice'.  Making more than a cameo appearance is the Statue of Liberty, who, Pickle says \\"shines her torch for those lost from all over the world.\\"  Through the predictable plot (Penguin gets lost and ends up again at the Statue of Liberty where Pickle finds him, after broadcasting his Missing Penguin on the air) we see that friendship prevails.  It's a sweet story with a happy and quirky ending that would be a great read-aloud to grades PK-1 or an engaging read-alone to emerging readers.	2005-02-08

He tries to grab it, but it just slips through his fingers.  On the walk along the beach to his home, he finds a starfish and thinks it's a star from the sky.  The last picture is of the boy sitting with his starfish and reading to it.  Even though the story has been told before (think Pooh), it's always magical, and the illustrations are simple, yet mesmerizing. This is a wonderful bedtime book and would also make a great read-aloud in a classroom, where it could be used in a beginning astronomy unit.	2005-02-08

Sequel to My Little Sister Ate One Hare, this book follows the same basic format: rollicking, lively rhyme, fun illustrations, and ridiculous plot.  It follows the once-omnivorous, now hug-iferous sister through hugging episodes with animals from a (ape) to z (zebra).  The vivid, action-packed illustrations are a riot and would work well for both classroon read-aloud and read-alone sessions.

She thinks they go to bed, but they stay up all night making a special tribute to her as she sleeps.  In the morning she is greeted by all they made and manages to make them each feel like they are 'loved best'.  All that said, it is only the storyline that is typical: the family is trollish (cute) monsters and what they do is fairly gross (e.g., for a gift for Mama, \\"Mattie hukkkked hairballs and wrapped them with stinkweed\\") so the story is more appealing and engaging to kids.  The illustrations are detailed enough to make this a great read-alone, but large and vivid enough to pull in an entire classroom.

This book is a sequel to Excuse Me!, using the same set of froggy characters, quirky illustrations, and subtle humor.  Like the first book (which dealt with burping),  Tissue, Please! is a book on using good manners, even when body functions get out of hand (literally, in this book - yuck!)  The main character, Frog, is having a difficult time with his runny nose and doesn't know about using tissues. He grosses out several adults, before his mother finally introduces him to tissues.  There are a few funny scenes (like during the ballet, when frog deftly swoops up a tissue en plie to wipe his nose and the other froggy dancers follow suit.<br /><br />As anyone who has worked with a class full of very young children knows, many do not know about blowing their nose; this book provides humorous, yet delicately handled, instruction.  This is a great book to use during the fall and winter flu seasons, perhaps coupled with a nonfiction germ book for young children, like Germs Make Me Sick (Reading Rainbow Books).	2005-02-08

It begins with a rather ordinary fellow (normal except for his odd taste in striped, pointy hats) who escapes into adventures he finds in books.  \\"If only his real life were as exciting\\" is his lament, while the readers are clued in that a female match for Mr. Katapat is nearby (same weird hat).  Predictably, they meet...unpredictably, on unicycles.  The book ends with them sharing literary adventures, \\"but that's another story.\\"  It's a sweet book that is pleasant enough, but lacks the depth and detail it needs to be popular with the age group it is written for.

You know you have joined the 21st century when children's books show the protagonist playing a video game.  Undoubtedly, most kids will be able to relate to this, but I confess I didn't know what \\"level 20\\" meant when I opened this book.  It was a jarring contrast to what seemed to be the topic of the book: fall leaves.  Then it hit me, the contrast is one of the things that makes this book interesting and as arresting as the bright, digitally-colored illustrations that help tell the story.  And the story is that Mom forces the video-game-playing boy to go outside and play.  While outside, he and some likewise digitally marooned boys decide the last leaf to fall is the lucky one.  His friends finally give up the wait, and there are some humorous frames of the boy and his dog in the leaves, impatiently waiting.  Finally, he does catch it and take it home where - no surprise - he is wearing the leaf on his head to give him luck while he again plays level 20.  It's not a typical story where the young boy rediscovers nature, but it is something kids can relate to, even if it does make some of us diehard video-game haters blood boil!	2005-02-08

The 3rd book in his wildly funny series on body parts idioms, Even More Parts shows this author has never lost his ability to see things from the child's perspective, even if is macabre and a bit weird!  The scene opens with our protagonist writing a \\"list of all the scary things\\" he's heard.  This list is what the bulk of the book is constructed around: idioms on body parts, illustrated with crazy interpretations of them.  For example, \\"I want all eyes on me\\" shows a teacher being pelleted with her classes' eyeballs.  In the bottom margin of the pages are even more crazy interpretations of common idioms, in miniature.  Altogether, this is a hysterically funny book, and is a great read-aloud for younger elementary classrooms and an engaging read-alone for older children.  This might also be used for to stimulate student creativity in upper elementary and lower middle school art/anatomy/literature projects and is a wonderful introduction for kids on what idioms are.	2005-02-08

It's easy to blow this book off as too saccharine, repetitive, and dull -  but it's good to remember that nursery rhymes are important to very young children's sense of meter and phonetics.  This book represents a modern treatment of Brown's work, written in 1952, in that the illustrations pull the reader farther into the story than the text does, which was considered verboten then. This helps make this simple book of rhyme more engaging for young readers. While it would work as a classroom read-aloud, it's a better bedtime book, one that would be a wonderful gift for a new grandma, too	2005-02-08

Newspaper cartoonist Bramhall has cooked up a fun book out of a bit of jazzy dialog, lively illustrations, funny settings, and a pinch of problem-solving.  Our protagonist, Hepcat, has a case of stage fright that makes him think he has no music in him and say \\"I lost my groove.\\"  As he searches for the self-confidence to finish his concert, he runs across a fun cast of characters (beatles who are Beetles, for one) who give him advice and/or cacophony that makes him realize that music IS everywhere and give him back his 'groove'.  While many of the jokes may be out of kid's comprehension, adults who read this will get a kick out of his charicatures of famous personalities and they way he weaves their lyrics into the text.  Kids will enjoy the action and expression Bramhall has packed into the hysterically funny illustrations.

Hot City is one of those picture books that jumps right off the coffee table and gets under your skin.  The funny, jazzy, spontaneous, and easy-to-follow text is perfectly illuminated with the bright, lively, syncopated, and imaginative illustrations.  The plot is simple enough: a sister and her younger brother finding things to do on a very hot summer day in the city.  The dialog moves us through their activities: spying on the 'blah-blah' ladies (that must be universal - how kids feel about their mothers' company and their endless prattle); eating snow cones (\\"we lick fast, but not fast enough\\"); and escaping into a cool library.  While plopped \\"down in a big old chair, smooth and cool, like a throne\\" sister (now Princess) escapes on the back of a unicorn and thwarts a pirate-robber before her brother - riding in on a T.Rex - calls her back to the reality of the library and they depart for home.

The book takes us through a neighborhood in transition, from a slum to a service area to a vibrant, tree-filled paradise.  Through it all, the story of a young girl growing up weaves it together and provides a timeline that is easy for small children to comprehend.  It's a simple story but eloquently presented to viewers through the incredible collages of paper, fabric, and pressed plant materials that are rich in detail and meticulously arranged.  The author closes the book with a beautiful passage, \\"People are discovering the need to nurture and to be nurtured by the unique character of the places where they live.  It takes time, as this book shows.

This book is just right for emerging readers; the text is action-packed, illustrations exciting and fun, and the story is easy-to-relate-to.  Superdog (aka weenie dog Dexter at the beginning of the book) gets tired of being bullied by the other dogs and even a smart-alecky tomcat named Cleevis.  Through determination and hard work, Dexter goes on a body-building mission that results in a (hilarious) new physique and bolstered confidence.  Laced with wonderful similes (e.g., Dexter \\"looked like a plump sausage sitting on four little meatballs\\") and comic-book action, the book would make a splendid read-aloud for younger elementary classrooms.  The author makes some wonderful points, beyond the central theme of \\"you can do anything you put your mind to\\": the good deeds Superdog does aren't big-time things, but small ways he worked to make the world a better place. Older students might be encouraged to write their own \\"Walter Mitty\\"/Superdog tale as part of a creative writing exercise, using this book as inspiration. Classroom applications aside, it's a great read-alone or bedtime read, partly because there's pictures hidden within the pictures, typical of Mark Buehner's other playful illustrations.	2004-10-28

Though the story ends on a positive note, there are plenty of nail-biting parts that are macabre enough to impress even the most jaded young reader.  The story is an action-packed and scary adventure that would make a great read-aloud in a classroom setting, as a study in African American folklore or story teller's perspective.

The illustrations are rich and fanciful, but not frilly - some of the pictures are downright scary and dark, as befits the shadowy poetry.  The book would work well as a read-aloud introduction to descriptive poetry in a classroom, but the language might be difficult for younger children to understand.  For example, the \\"Scottish Folk Poem\\" begins \\"Gin ye ca' me imp or elf\\" and is written entirely in Brogue - with no translation offered.  However, it would be a wonderful bedtime book for an older child who wouldn't be frightened by the images and could understand the similes and metaphors the poetry shines with.

It is an exciting presentation that would leave students hungry for more Shakespeare; Coville is a miracle-worker.  Many of the more famous lines of the play are left intact, making it easy for teachers to draw parallels between Coville's version and the original.  This is not surprising, considering Coville's background as an actor, playwright, and teacher.  Gore's illustrations are just right: cloudy, dark, filled with despair, and yet too interesting to ignore.  Exploring his shadowy pastel and linework technique would make a great classroom exercise to further illuminate the story line.  This is a book that obviously was carefully and lovingly crafted; I would strongly recommend it as an addition to all middle school libraries.	2004-10-28

In the eyes of 2nd - 4th grade readers, however, this book is likely 'just right.'  It's suspenseful, but not scary; intricate, but not boggling; fanciful, but not hard-to-relate-to.  It's a nice change from the typical early reader books and a good book for the transition to more involved chapter books.  The book, the second of a 4-part series, is O.K. for a stand-alone.  One nice thing about this book was that it showed a young girl dealing with challenges in a positive way and learning from her foibles; there is always a need for more books with messages like this.	2004-10-11

Even squeemish spider-haters couldn't help but love this book, it's so readable and fun!  Arachnologist  Sam Marshall leads the author and photographer on a quest that will inspire even the most reluctant young scientist.  Journeying through the jungles of French Guiana, we enounter the world's largest spider, the Goliath Birdeater Tarantula.  Nic Bishop's photos of the spiders are unexpectedly beautiful (how many eyes does that thing have?); he even managed to capture images of a spider shedding it's skin on a silk mat it wove especially for the occasion.  The book has a lot of human interest as well, as readers learn that Marshall was an apathetic student himself, until the joy of discovery through research snared him.  (Marshall is considered to be the world's foremost authority on tarantulas, and now is director of a the J.H. Barrow Field Station at Hiram University, where he is also an assistant professor.)  One of the neat things about this book, beyond telling us everything about tarantuals, is that it gives us a glimpse what scientific inquiry means in the field and lab.  There are photos of young lab students working with their research projects; a grade 5-8 reader would relate and be inspired by this portrayal.  This book would be an excellent addition to any middle school library or a great gift for an aspiring biologist or tarantula owner.	2004-10-11

If only the text delivered what the luscious illustrations in this book promise!  Everyone in our library who saw this book wanted to read it, the pictures and cover are so enticing.  However, after reading it I felt like I'd just been served a Big Mac by Julia Child, completely disillusioned.  Perhaps the characters are developed in the earlier books, but they ring hollow in this installment; they are as flat as paper dolls and the author resorts to a tired, old vision of the protagonist as Snow White.  The 3 kids, who have discovered a 'Faerie Field Guide' that is a hot commodity in Faerieland face off with some nasty goblins and dwarves.  The plot is all too predictable and yet we are left hanging in the air at the end of the book, presumably a tactic to sell the 5th book in the series.  This series might be fine for elementary-aged kids, if it wasn't for the scary scenes.  Surprisingly, the scare isn't from the goblins or other monsters, but from the way the mother of these kids fails to believe and/or protect them.  The series is dark like Lemony Snicket and The Awful End, but without the parody and fun the other 2 series offer readers.	2004-10-08

They just ask them.\\"  This line captures what is so unique about Cave Paintings to Picasso: analysis that provokes readers' critical thinking skills.  As an art student, I read so many tired art history books that did little to inspire or even entertain.  This book does both, and somehow manages to cover a lot of facts about 50 masterworks of art.  The beautifully-written description of the art and artist is chronologically organized, with sidebars on each page visually portraying the artist's timeline.  In addition, each work of art is briefly described as to media and size (information that is not easily gleaned from other art history texts).  There is a brief, but helpful glossary in the back of the book, and the book is well indexed.  The text is easy to read and very interesting; it would easily engage the interest of students grades 6 and up.	2004-10-08

The Alligator and His Uncle Tooth : A Novel of the Sea is a beautifully written book...Hayes' prose is lyrical and mystical.
