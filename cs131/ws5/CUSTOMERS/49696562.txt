Abby Cooper is an Intuitive, which comes in handy for solving this mystery.  I love the characters and how they interact in this book, and I think Ms. Laurie has struck a gold mind with this concept. The mystery was really good, kept me guessing and the humor is just the right amount for this reader.  I look forward to reading all the books in this series.	2005-10-13

Ranger is still mysterious, Stephanie is still confused and Morrelli is only thinking of one thing. The characters are all still funny but they are all doing the same thing in the same place. We need Stephanie to get married, maybe move, have kids, possibly go through police academy or something. I hate to give up on the series but if it continues like this, I see no reason to keep reading.	2005-09-27

The book starts out great then slows in the middle, then from out of no where is wrapped up in the last chapter. The London trip seemed like it was thrown in to take up pages. There didn't seem to be any big surprise as to who the bad guy was and I didn't seem to rush myself reading this book, more like having no interest in picking it up to finish it.  I really want to like this series, but the characters seem to be missing something....	2005-09-08

You get to see the life of a young carefree Benni and are introduced to Jack her first husband. Don't worry there is a mystery here and it is played out in the usual fashion that people love when they read this series.  I loved the ending of this book and also somehow Gabe came across as more sensitive than he has previously been. I like seeing that too! Look forward to the remaining books in the series.	2005-08-09

She was irritating, stuck on herself, had no morals, foul-mouthed and drank a lot.

This isn't your standard mystery/thriller story but a good story all the same.  If you are looking for a mystery/thriller you might be disappointed in this one. IF you are looking for a well told story, you will be glad your read this book.  I do have to say there is a slight twist to the story in the end. Although the story did leave me feeling sad with how the events played out it was still very well told.	2005-08-02

It seems that several authors that start out writing horror books end up maturing with their writing and putting out books like Life Expectancy. This is a very good book, not at all like Koontz's  earlier work but all the same a good book.  There is a story here, of family, love and commitment, believe it or not. You will not be bored though, because Mr. Koontz puts his wonderful, humorous and witty spin on things.	2005-07-01

However, you must read the 1st two books in the series first to get to know the characters and their past situations.

While the mystery was o.k., I didn't think it took top billing over the recipes and mention of food. Honestly, don't read this book if you are hungry.

I really liked the book, but this is the first time where I have read a book and liked it but hated all the main characters. I am wondering if that was Ms. Gardners intentions? Each character comes with a problem(s) and the author writes the suspense/mystery around the whole group. Very well done. The story builds over time so you must stick with it till the end. If you are a fan of Ms. Gardner you will be very happy you did.	2005-06-06

This book dealt more with the past than the present. Not much on mystery, but very good read anyway. You know who the bad guy is, and the whole mystery part takes place in 1942. It is enjoyable following Mary around and listening to her dialouge esp. to herself. I do like the way Ms.Scottoline ties everything up at the end. I will read/listen to more of her books.	2005-05-25

I will always read each book that comes out starring China Bayles. This book, however, felt and read more like a transition book for China and some of the main characters. The mystery seemed secondary, which is fine for me, I like to see character development. If this had been the first book in the series I had ever read it may have turned me off from reading any others.  So if you have not read any other China Bayles books, please start with the first one.	2005-05-12

I loved it. It was nice to see the history of O'Connor and his mentor Jack. I thought Ms. Burke pulled this one off nicely with the mystery being spread over a 40+ yr timeframe. Nice job. It was nice to see new characters introduced also, I hope to see them in future books. If you haven't read this series, you could probably get away with starting out with this book. I have to tell you though that you are missing a lot by not reading all of the other books in the Irene Kelly series.	2005-04-27

Critt and feel she does a wonderful job. Snapshot takes you into the  world of hospitals and medicine and secrets they may hold. Carlotta is  taken into this world by her customer who later cannot be found. Snapshot  has many twist and turns (which I enjoy in a novel). Several people who  could be the bad guy, and our old favorites Mooney, Gloria and Sam make  appearances. Although they are not involved as much as in the previous  novels.  Snapshot will not let you down if you are looking for a good  whodunit with a great protagonist.	2000-06-08

This is a great who done it that keeps you guessing till the end. I usually don't read police procedure books but I found that this one  really gets you involved with the characters. Read and enjoy!	2000-05-26

The main character is very independent and the storyresolves around horses and a good mystery. Another favorite to add tomy list!	2000-04-19
