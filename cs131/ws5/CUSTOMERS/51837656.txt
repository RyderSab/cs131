About Short: <br /> <br />There is enough to read along especially in the <br />games on the 2nd half of the book. <br /> <br />On games: <br /> <br />The explanationations are often clearer than what I expected, <br />so that was a pleasant surprise (being 1650, I often <br />find these annotations over my head). <br /> <br />There are plenty of diarams. <br /> <br />But, sometimes 10 moves will go by and there will <br />no explanations in any of those moves.  <br /> <br />The drama of the World Chess Championships earned <br />the 4th star. Otherwise, I may have to give it 3. <br /> <br />Recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-07-05

Majority of them are good <br />for 1000-1500. 1500-1700 rated people will benefit b/c <br />of the practice, b/c there are definitely some tough ones. <br /> <br />negative point: <br /> <br />this idea of \\"target\\" really does not work evry well <br />in real life. These should have been presented in <br />different context. e.g. What is white's best move? <br />Then, each could have been explained in terms what <br />should have tipped off the reader to the break <br />through tactics. <br /> <br />It still deserves 4.5 stars b/c they are so many <br />to practice with and they are all good ones (some <br />are easy, sure, but not all). <br /> <br />If you are over 1700, most likely you will not benefit <br />from this.	2005-05-16

However, you don't have to become really good <br />at tactics before reading book. see, the tactics book has <br />2 levels of porblems. Ones that are easy and ones that are <br />really tough. As long as you can get through the erasy ones <br />in each chapter, you are ready for this book. <br /> <br />This book is real genius (2 negative poinst are mentioned <br />below), here is why: <br /> <br />1. author used very simple language <br />2. he answered so many of my questions  <br />3. it, i think, covers every situation I could think of <br />4. it is broken down by chapters, each one covering <br />   either a a general principle (e.g. where <br />   pieces should aspire to go, only it is NOT boring) <br />5. It teaches you how to think and evaluate any position <br />    and then formulate a strategy. <br /> <br />2 negative points: <br /> <br />1. really there should have been more diagrams per example. <br />2. there should have a chapter (separate) on \\"how to evaluate <br />   a position\\". The topic is covered in different chapters. <br /> <br />I am so impressed: I want o give examples: <br /> <br />lets say you are ahead a minor piece, what should <br />youn do? <br /> <br />lets say you are ahead in development, what should you do? <br />answer is attack. <br /> <br />Ok, so where should you attack? center, q-wing, k-wing? <br />let's say that you should attack on king-side, what <br />conditions must exist (or you should play to create) <br />before going for the actual attack? <br /> <br />How do you attack? pawns? prices?  <br />what do you attack? king? a piece? a square? <br /> <br />great book really. <br />I would say best for ratings 1350-1800. mine is 1600+.	2005-03-15
