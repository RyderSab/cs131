And he wrote the book on writing westerns.  <br /> <br />This review is based upon the online version of the story, \\"Tumbleweed Fever\\", but at $115+ I'm unlikely to buy the PB. :) <br />The author has a neat way with dialogue and the ploting is pretty good, but there are some jarring bits dealing with the West that hurt the story. If these were corrected in the PB, I appologize. <br /> <br />For example, the use of the term 'rider', rather than cowboy or cowgirl. There is actual slang from the period and various terms are still used today. \\"Hand\\" or \\"Top hand\\", \\"Wrangler\\" etc.  Cowboy, btw is actually not historically accurate. But to invent a term in order to be PC just doesn't work.  <br /> <br />The author also seems to lack even an elementary knowledge of firearms. <br />\\"Devlin just glared at the young woman and her sense of humor. The rider double checked the load of the rifle and slid it into its leather holster on the left side of the saddle, stuffing an extra box of cartridges into the saddlebag. She pulled one of her own six-guns from it's holster and pulled the chamber open to assure herself there were indeed six bullets in the cartridge. Then she held the pistol out for Sarah to take\\" <br /> <br /> <br />1) you don't \\"pull the chamber open\\" the chamber is the hole in the cylinder that takes the cartridge. You pull open the loading gate, on pistols that have one. Like the Colt SAA. <br /> <br />2)There aren't \\"six bullets in the cartridge\\". The bullet is the lead projectile. The cartridge is the metallic case, powder, primer and bullet. <br /> <br />3)If this is a Colt SAA or 'clone' you only load 5 cartridges. That's because the firing pin is fixed and a sharp blow to the hammer will detonate the cartridge, putting a bullet through your leg or rear end if the pistol is in the holster, or through your head if you drop it on a rock. Usually the chamber under the hammer was kept empty or perhaps used to hold a rolled up bill or 'mad money'. <br /> <br />The author show a deal of promise as a story teller. There is some really good dialogue and nice interaction between the lead characters. However the background/history is poorly done and secondary characters are not well fleshed out.	2005-09-18

There's now a movie \\"Grizzly Man\\" based on the authors own videos, where you can see and hear the author himself. As a party game, try and count how many times he mentions \\"dying for these <br />bears\\". Obsessed with bears? Perhaps. Obsessed with dying? Yes! <br />Unfortunately the movies producer decided *not* to add the final video (actually audio as it appears the girlfriend didn&#8217;t have time totake the lens cap off) of this idiots final moments.  I think this sanitizes a horrible and stupid death which is precisely the lesson people should take from this man&#8217;s life. Sadly he managed to get his girlfried killed as she attempted to save his life. &#65279;Apparently the author changed his mind about dying for the bears at the last moment. &#65279;With incredibly bravery she apparently attempted to drive the bear away, losing her own life in the process.   <br /> <br />Interestingly the movie's website compares it to \\" Into Thin Air and Into the Wild\\" both books about how reality will turn around and bite you . <br /> <br /> Book and movie are perfect for home or school to show children what happens to stupid, careless or ignorant people.  Better for them to learn from other people mistakes than end up dead or crippled. Or worse, take a friend with them. Used copies of all these books are easily found and a must give to your school or family members.	2005-09-02

I can only give it three stars due to the authors breakdown in logic. He is wrong about gun control for the very same reason he is right about non-drug control. If an individual, under the influence of drugs, commits a crime: beats his wife, robs a bank, crashes a plane, he or she is busted.Otherwise the author, rightly IMO, believes the entire effort to&#8216;control&#8217; drugs is both futile and an enormous waste of effort and money. Why then are firearms seen differently? If you make a mistake with a gun or commit a crime, you pay the penalty, just as if you misuse drugs or your automobile or anything else.  But the use or misuse of drugs, automobiles, airplanes or guns is a human decision, not something inherit in guns or anything else. <br /> <br />A well written, articulate book worth checking out of the library and possibly worth buying at the bargain bin.  <br />	2005-08-28

If you're a \\"true believer\\" in Ayn Rand, this is the book for you. The thing than Randists seem not to grasp is that, big business is just like big government or big religion. ANY large organization exists for itself. There is no intrinsic virtue in capitalism, just as there is no intrinsic virtue in government. Mr. Hull seems not to have ever heard of the Robber Barons of the 19th Century or some of the more recent episodes such as  Archer Daniels Midland or WorldCom.  <br />The point is *not* that capitalism is evil, but that it&#8217;s not good either. It (like government or religion) can be either, or both, depending of where the observer stands in relation to the event. y all means, check this book out of the library, but also look at history, even recent history. Unrestrained, business is perfectly happy to use child slave labor or to dump tons of toxins in people back yards. *Not* because business/capitalism is evil, but because is simply doesn&#8217;t care. A corporation has no morality, any more than a government bureaucracy has any morality.  Both simply follow policy, whatever that policy is. <br />	2005-08-20

It&#8217;s a beautiful book with wonderful illustrations and <br />photographs.  E. G. Heath is one of the world greatest authorities on the bow and it shows in this comprehensive book which starts with the origins of the bow (with some terrific photographs from the 1930's of primitive hunters who actually used the bow as their primary weapon) graduated to the compound bow and then on to the heyday of the English Longbow, its military decline and revival as a sporting weapon. If there is a fault, it is that the font is a bit small for comfortable reading and the index is not quite as extensive as it might by. These are minor faults for a unique book that gives such a broad review of archery from the stone age to modern times Asian and Western. While the coverage of any one subject or area is necessarily brief, this is more than made up for by the bibliography at the end of each chapter. <br /> <br />I note that there is a new (2002) edition listed on Amazon.co.uk, New for USD $135.00, Used for USD $102 while the 1971 edition that I have is available for USD $207.00. I can not speak to the 2002 edition but the 1971 edition is well worth the price.	2005-08-16

Real Publishers, with editors tell them the truth. Real Publishers also demand at least a modicum of ability and originality. This book is a rehash, badly done, of arguments, quips, quotes, etc. from hundreds of previous essays by better writers.  Bad enough to waste your money on this trash, but you'd also waste a few hours of your life as well.    Read, Stephen J. Gould, C. S. Lewis, Martin Gardner, The Talmud, The Blind Watchmaker . . .    There are thousands of better and better written books in the world. Spend your time and money on them.    Don't take my word for it, try interlibrary loan and <shudder> read it for yourself.    Update:  Reply To \\"Tami Nobel\\"  &#65279;I've got a fan. :)  1)I'm not a mystic. If you read my review you'd see that I suggest that readers spend their time and money on Gould & Lewis. In other words, read both sides and make up their own mind,  rather than swilling down regurgitated pap. I like your list of authors, but note it seems a bit one sided.  2) A couple of points about ad hominem attacks. Youre using two variants:    a)Assertion of Perversity: stating (as is you know my own mind better than I do) that my statements are the result of . . .   \\"mean-spirited, arrogant,\\"  *such fulsome praise warms the cockles of my heart.* None the less, its ad hominem an attack of my person, not my review.    b)  False Consciousness: again, stating that unless I adopt a certain mindset or point of view, my opinion is at fault.   No literate person on earth. . . could possibly say that \\"Atheist Universe\\" is not exceptionally well-written.    \\"irrelevant reviews of books he's obviously never even read\\"    (...)      c) I simply gave my opinion, that this book is trash and offered some alternatives. BUT I also, as I often do, suggested that the reader of my review read the book for him or her self. I simply  suggested that he or she get it from the library before buying it. The very same thing Ido myself before buying a book.  I also very seldom give more than one star, because  normally only the  badly written (IMO) books irritate me enough to actually write a review.     <sigh> I suppose, in fairness, I should write some favorable reviews. I do sometimes suggest certain alternatives when I do a review. Naively I supposed that readers would think those books  were ones I liked.  Look for the following reviews at some future date:    Religion: The Essential Teachings of Zen Master Hakuin, translated by Norman Waddell  Fiction: The Palm-wine Drinkard & My Life in the bush of ghosts by Amos Tutuola  History: The Grey Goose Wing, Legends of the Longbow (reprint) by E.G. Heath  Biology: Behavior Problems in Dogs by William E. Campbell  Math:    Mathematics; A Chronicle of Human endeavor by Herbert I. Gross  Biography: The Letters of Private Wheeler ed. Captain B. H. Liddell Hart    In case it is not apparent from context, IMO these are book well worth the money to purchase them and the time spent in reading them.	2005-08-15

Which is unfortunate, for he is right about intellectual hucksters in many cases. However he himself becomes one when he starts his rants about evolution, sexuality, etc. One problem, among many, appears to be that he simply has no grasp of scientific method at all.   As a brief example, his idea of discrediting Darwin is to inform readers that Marx, Hegel & Hitler liked the idea - - - which discredits Darwin? Oh, and Hitler was a vegetarian and non smoker, which discredits ecologists?  Kinsey & sexuality: What the author seems not to grasp is that Kinsey was investigating what people actually do. Not what the author wishes they would do, not what the author believes god, church and government wants them to do, but what people actually do. And they do some pretty bizarre d**n stuff.  A brief reading of history will show that Kinsey was right. A brief look across the Internet will show things that would give Kraft-Ebbing nightmares.   &lt;sigh> For the author&#8217;s benefit, let&#8217;s review the scientific method:  1: Observation: Scientists actually *observe* the thing they are studying and gather/record information, sometimes called data (sing: datum) 2: Hypothesis: a generalization the, hopefully, explains the observations 3: TEST the hypothesis: often scientists try to *disprove* the hypothesis to see if it actually accounts for observations. 4: Hypothesis is accepted, rejected or modified.  This is NOT a checklist, but rather a mindset.  The author OTOH, appears to favor argumentum ad hominem, argument by attacking the person rather than the argument itself.  A moderately  readable book if you stick with his rants on the political rather than the scientific, but don't buy  it. Go to the library.	2005-08-14

Police, animal control, landlord.<br /><br />2) If she couldn&#8217;t get satisfaction, and quickly, *she* should have moved out.  It&#8217;s not fair, it&#8217;s not right, but it would have gotten her out of the  way of the dogs and their idiot owners.<br /><br />3) She should have armed herself. That&#8217;s not PC, but if you&#8217;re going in harms way you need to take precautions. And she, through no fault of her own, was placed in harms way.<br /><br />The dog owners?

Frankly terrorism and terrorists come and go, but the constitution is with us always. Unlike the author, I'll keep the <br />constitution and bill of rights and take my chances with terrorists. <br /> <br />As an example of the authors flawed thinking, he mentions that after 1973, when new airport screening was introduced, 5000 guns were collected from passengers as if this were a good thing <br />(or that armed passengers were a bad thing) but what he fails to grasp that, although 5000 guns were collected there were NOT 5000 or even 500  or even 5 incidents involving firearms then or <br />in the previous years before screening. Nor does he seem to make the connection that the 9/11 hijackers managed to take over their aircraft with box cutters and planning and willingness to die. <br />Could armed passengers or pilots have made a difference? Would things have been any worse? <br /> <br />Lets look at the UK. Many surveillance cameras and draconian police powers. The result? Pretty pictures of men alleged to be bombers (yet the bombs still went off and a second attempt almost <br />succeeded) and one innocent man shot dead by police.  <br /> <br />Terrorists are always going to be with us. In an industrial society technology acts as a force multiplier. One or two or a dozen men can kill thousands if they are determined. Auto accidents kill 50K/year.  A Tsunami  will kill tens of thousands. Civil war kills hundreds of thousands. And a pandemic may kill millions.  And no one is even bothering to count dead and dying of starvation.  <br /> <br />Terror is a problem, but it's more a problem of the mind and the author is stoking fears to sell books. Shame on him.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-31

Health savings account, Thrift savings to replace SS, etc. Unfortunately when the author speaks about a national sales tax he does not seem to be cognizant of a tiny problem with his idea. Taxation is used to control people, that's where 'deductions' and special interest come from. A sales tax will have the same problems. Special Interest and others will use a sales tax to eliminate things they don't like by taxing them out of existance or reducing tax on things they approve of. The beef board will fight to remove tax on meat while PeTA will loby to tax beef out of range of any but the very rich. The same thing will happen with SUV's, books, churches, guns, abortion, etc. I'd love to see reform of the tax code, but a national sales tax simply moves the battle from money you earn to money you spend.

We know when the society was founded, have written records covering almost the entire period and it&#8217;s isolated from European culture for all practical purposes. Read &#8220;Collapse&#8221;, then read about the Free State.  Look at how Icelandic society and economy changed according to changes in natural resources.   The question is not whether the reader *likes* the results, but do observations match the hypothesis.  The hypothesis (very generally speaking) is that environmental  <br />collapse leads to societal collapse.  The book then presents observations to support that thesis. There are nearly always problems when trying to write a popular book covering such a broad and complicated thesis. <br /> <br /> The reader doesn&#8217;t have to believe me or the author or any reviewer.  The data is public record for the most part, available at any public or university library.  <br /> <br />While I may disagree with some of the details, overall I agree with the thesis.  Environmental collapse leads to societal collapse.  Which is neither a pro environmental nor anti business stance.  Frankly, both sides of that argument are mush-for-brains.  For years &#8220;business&#8221; fought the introduction of &#8216;environmentally friendly cleaners&#8217; to replace the old petrochemical cleaners. After they were forced to accept them . . .they found the new cleaners were cheaper, better and easier to use. And workers didn&#8217;t get sick using them.  Productivity and profits went up.  <br /> <br />OTOH, some rabid environmentalists seem to feel that business is their natural enemy, without realizing that a subsistence society has neither the leisure nor the free capital to *think* about the environment, let alone  work to preserve it. If it&#8217;s a choice between starving or eating the last great auk . . . Only rich societies can afford to worry about the environment. <br />  <br />Read the book, do the research make up your own mind.	2005-02-10

On a top ten list, he'd be somewhere around -230 or so. Basically he's an SF author for people who don't like SF. Lot's of Gee-Whiz science which quickly becomes dated, hackneyed, predictable plots and characters who are two-dimensional at best, one dimensional normally and occasionally no-dimensional. I won't speak for the rest of the world, but IMO Americans are smarter than Crichton seems to give them credit in this novel.(then again, his novels are predicated upon his characters doing incredibly stupid things. Perhaps that's simply his view of the rest of the world.) <br />At any rate, his science is dated, his view of the world is dated and the story is painfully turgid and boring.

McNamara is going to go down in history alongside:<br /><br />Ambrose Burnside (instead of using a shallow ford at Antietam creek he funneled them across a narow bridge),Montgomery at Arnhem (194: 70% of his troops killer or captured)or Clades Variana who managed to lose two entire legions in the Teutoburg forest (and help hasten the end of the empire)<br /><br />Actually, McNamara will make a name for himself just as Braxton Bragg did.  A 'mcnamara' will be a blind blundering egocentric who causes death and anguish yet couldn't pour p*ss from a boot with the instructions printed on the heel.<br /><br />For a better read<br /><br />try:<br /><br />Dirty Little Secrets of the Vietnam War<br /><br />or better still<br /><br />Steel My Soldiers' Hearts : The Hopeless to Hardcore Transformation of U.S. Army, 4th Battalion, 39th Infantry, Vietnam<br /><br />or indeed anyting by David Hackworth	2005-01-05

Not nearly enough time is spent building up the characters. There's an abrupt and totally unexplained bit of 'elf soft porn' between Tinker and 'Windwolf', followed quickly by an almost rape by Tinkers friend and almost lover 'Nathen'. And it all happens simply because the author wanted it. NOT, as far as I can tell, out of any internal logic. The entire story seem to be like this, bits and pieces stuck together at random. A bit of fantasy here, some SF jargon there, a dash of soft-porn here, mix quickly with some mystery and half-bake for 340 pages. <br /> <br />What a shame. This had the start of a great story. Instead it's a mish-mash of almost this and nearly that but not a complete story in the lot.	2004-11-18

Instead it's insufferably slow going. <br />I found myself constantly thinking \\"get to the point already!\\" <br />There is no focus. The book skips from one disjointed, confusing and ultimately uninteresting subject/POV to another. The main character is \\"almost\\" interestng, but not quite. A minor \\"surfer dude\\" character uses a faux accent that might have worked for a few lines, but goes on for a migraine making chapter's worth of: <br />\\"Um . . . no. Not like that at all. Just . . . she wears a lot of black, okay? And silver jewelry. She'll probably be wearing, like, lots of silver jewelry. And she has this really cool Celtic knot kind of bracelet tattooed around one wrist. Like, left, I think.\\" <br /> <br />There are some interesting bits in the story, but ultimately not enough to make up for the fact that the main character is uninteresting, the story is boring (how may post apocalyptic worlds/evil galactic civilizations do we really need? Especially badly written ones?) <br /> <br />Fortunately BAEN offers free chapters for most of their books. Go to baen.com and read for yourself.  <br /> <br />Personally I think this is bargain bin material.  It's a shame, because there are flashes of really good stuff here. IMO, one of the two authors knows how to write. It's just too bad the collaboration was so disastrous. <br /> <br />If you want to read really good stories about galactic civilizations, post apocalyptic earth, etc. try H.

Which, as anyone who is moderately observant (or reads Jay Gould)knows is not the way the universe works.  For example, he postulates humanity \\"500 and 1,000 million years from now . . .the birds are gone. So too are the <br />amphibians. . . .There are still lizards, and snakes, and scorpions and cockroaches. And humans. All of humanity, or what is left of it, now lives underground in the cooler recesses of the Earth.\\" <br /> <br />Good grief . . . humanity can manage to survive 500 million years and the best they can do is huddle underground with cockroaches and snakes?  We're probably within 50 years or so of being <br />able to re-create extinct species, almost certainly no more than a century and possibly much less.  But 500 million years from now, the best humans can manage are scorpions?  <br /> <br />And the idea that humanity is somehow extinction proof flies in the face of reality. If the Yellowstone caldera should decide to erupt North America would be destroyed and much of the rest of the world would be severely if not fatally damaged. Solar flares, very large rocks falling on the earth, pandemics, etc. etc. These are just a few things that could destroy the human race. Saying humanity is extinction proof is as silly as saying a ship is \\"unsinkable\\" because it has few water tight bulkheads. That simply makes you harder to sink, not impossible.   <br /> <br />On top of errors such as this, the writing is simply bad. It's turgid and unimaginative, not much above a sophomore college level.  Ward is supposedly a geologist. He should stick to talking about rocks. It's possible he may know something about them. <br /> <br />IMO, this book speaks more about Wards psychology than it does about possible future evolution. <br /> <br />Buy this book used or in the $1.00 bargain bin.	2004-09-22

The opening was great and there are flashes of good stuff throughout. But, overall, it's pretty bad. Characters are introduced w/o any real build up. Characterizations are spotty at best and the heroine, Karigan, isn't very heroic. Mostly she seems to worry/complain a lot and wait for someone (one of the 'Eletian' for instance) to help her. There are a lot of other problems as well. For example, Karigan and the guide both feel uneasy about the spot chosen for a camp. The expedition leader refuses to give in to 'supersition', and of course everyone is attacked and slaughtered during the night. On top of a cliche that would be old in a teen-age slasher fic, Karigan gets up early for guard duty . . . and goes off w/o her sword! I got as far as page 83 and couldn't force myself to read further. I flipped through the book, hoping to find a better spot, w/o success. <br />Why are elves, excuse me, 'Eletian', always immortal and *unhappy* about it? Why do they always brood about the past? Why not some *happy* immortals? Magical messengers on horseback? I suggest Mercedes Lackey. She did it better. <br /> The dread ancient evil awakening has been done to death. <BR>For a complete list of every overdone cliche in this and many other fantasy books:<BR>&quot;The Tough Guide to Fantasy Land&quot; by Diana Wynne Jones.<BR>Sadly out of print, I got mine from Amazon.com UK.

I wish Ms. Britain had written that story and forgotten about Karigan.<br />I'm asking for my money back on this one. Hopefully Ms. Britain's next effort will have a better editor.	2003-12-24

For someone who is supposed to be an historian, Burke makes<BR>some surprising blunders.  He makes constant and poetic references such as \\". . . scattered islands of light in a sea of darkness. . .\\" p 95 or \\". . . papal mind control . . .\\" p104 and talks about the \\"dark ages\\" p93.<BR>The \\"dark ages\\" as well as the *Fall* of the Roman Empire. Both the \\"Dark Ages\\" and the *Fall* are discredited terms, not used by serious historians. The so called \\"Dark Ages\\" were actually quite active in terms of science, technology and philosophy, while the Roman Empire never actually fell, but rather transmuted in the West and flourished in the East.<br />Burke and Ornstein both seem to ignore the fact that there  was another world besides the Greek and Roman one. There is brief mention (*very* brief) of other civilizations, Chinese, Indian, etc. but the general thrust of the book seems to imply that the entire world began and ended with the Roman West.<br />NONSENSE! During the periods he is talking about, trade flourished, technology and pure science were vigorous and innovative and the arts were respected and supported. Certainly there were times and places dominated by poverty, intolerance and ignorance.  Even without the \\"Axemaker's Gift\\" there are still periods of famine, drought and disease. Populations crash quite nicely without any human intervention.<br />Then there is the nonsensical theme that technology (the \\"axemaker's gift\\") is bad or detrimental. This is something that could only have been written by someone who has never had to work, really work, in their life. Certainly technology<BR>can be abused. Nor can it be disputed that individuals have been exploited and abused by ruling elites.  But these same large technological civilizations have also provided the wealth and leisure time to support philosophers and artists. If not for<BR>the \\"axemaker's gift\\" Burke and Ornstein wouldn't have had the ability to even think about the *problem* of the \\"Axemaker's Gift\\", let alone been able to write it. They would have been too busy trying to gather and store enough food to last through the winter. Or would have died of old age at 40, never having had the time and leisure to accrue the knowledge and experience to even worry about the ills of technology.<br />This book is worth a $1 from the `Bargain Bin'. Otherwise, don't waste your money.<br />If you want to get an idea of what the \\"Axemaker's Gift\\" was<BR>really like during the \\"Dark\\" ages:<br />1) Cathedral, Forge and Waterwheel<BR>by Joseph Gies <br />2) The Medieval Siege by Jim Bradbury<br />3) Technology in World Civilization by Arnold Pacey<BR>4) The Medieval Machine by Jean Gimpel<br />5) Engineering in History by R.

He is the ONLY fiction<BR>author that I automatically buy the Hard Back editions as soon as they are published. Or at least I used to.<br />This book is both new and interesting. Unfortunately, what is new is not interesting and what is interesting is not new. Boring characters, plodding and predictable plot.  <br />I am predisposed to like anything Mr. Weber writes and (as a snow storm is expected in the area) I was looking forward to a good read during a snow bound weekend.<br /> I couldn't make it as far as the third chapter before I gave up and returned the book. The characters were entirely uninteresting and unsympathetic. The plot was cliched, basically a much watered down \\"High Crusade\\" and there was as much dynamic tension as might be found in a broken rubber band. <br />I can only assume that his publishers at Baen are pushing him to churn out as many words as possible since he's their biggest money-maker.  But quality is suffering, as his last two books \\"March Up Country/to the Sea\\" were, In My Opinion, so badly written and boring that I couldn't get past the first five chapters and returned both to the store for a refund.<br />And to compare this to Paul Anderson's \\"High Crusade\\" is like comparing \\"Man O' War\\" to a donkey. They've both got four legs and hooves, but that's the extent of it. <br />If you're a David Weber fanatic (which I am) you'll want this book. But wait for it to be reduced in price. I'd estimate that ($$$) is a fair price for the Hard Back edition.  If you've never read David Weber, don't start with this book. Try \\"Path of the Fury\\" instead. I've worn out three copies and am working on a fourth. I've worn out two copies of \\"Crusade\\" and I've got 'reading' copies of all the Honor Harrington books (as opposed to  collector editions which I keep sealed in plastic  bags)<br />This is of course ONLY my opinion and there are quite<BR>a lot of best sellingauthors that I can't stand.  In My Opinion, David Weber at his best compares  favorably with Robert A. Heinlein or H. Beam Piper. So, I am perhaps being unfair, since this is probably a quite readable story. But it suffers badly in  comparison with David Weber's best efforts,  (\\"In Death Ground\\" for example)which are superb. <br />If Mr. Weber was not such a wonderful writer I would not bother writing such a negative review.<BR>However I am concerned that quality is being sacrificed for quantity. I would rather have fewer<BR>but better books, than a glut of hastily written and inferior works. <br />Baen publishing should take better care of the best writer they have.	2001-12-22

The government of the United States is a representativerepublic; rule by law ----not the mob rule of democracy.

He seems to believe that the individuals that make up government would be able to create paradise on earth if only they weren't hampered by outmoded concepts like laws and rules. <br />The Federal Government is not perfect. It is not supposed to be. NOR is it supposed to be efficient and streamlined.  It is deliberately designed so that no one is _in charge_; allowing individuals to get on with their lives with the minimum possible interference. The idea that individuals, merely because they have a laminated US Gov. ID, are somehow more moral, ethical and honest than those without such imprimatur is completely divorced from reality.  You only have to watch the physical battles (fists, guns and knives) among parliamentarians in various parts of the world to see that being a government official conveys no especial virtue.<br />The illogic, distortions and poor scholarship make this book a painful read.
