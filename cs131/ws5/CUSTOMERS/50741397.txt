Lawana Blackwell did a fantastic job of creating a contemporary story in quaint Mississippi. Her character development was superb with the complexities of Carley's and Brooke's characters. Carley Reed is a teacher in California, living the life she fixed for herself after her unstable mother, Linda dies. She focuses on her teaching trying to forget her rough upbringing until one day a P.I. arrives, saying her grandmother has died and left her quite a sizable heritance. After being fired from the prestigious school, Carley decides to travel to Mississippi, to the little town of Tallulah to see her grandmother's estate for herself. After meeting the local people and seeing the quaintness of the small town life, Carley decides to stay and open a cafe. Then comes Brooke, a high-school dropout whom Carley takes under her wing after learning about Brooke's almost identitical rough start in life as Carley, herself. To add to the suspense in the story, there is a unsolved hit and run of the local pastor's wife and the murderer could be closer to Carley than she realized. Then there is Carley's refusal to attend church with other believers because of the horrific ordeal she has gone through with a \\"believer\\". Will Carley turn her heart back to God and trust His believers? Will the murderer be found before Carley finds herself in an even worse situation than ever before? I loved this story very much and I am so looking forward to Lawana's next contemporary book.	2005-07-20

For those of you who have read the first edition of \\"Like A River Glorious\\" I would like to let you know of this book.... Lawana rewrote her first edition and this version is much better than the one before. So if you didn't enjoy the first edition you might want to try this new edition. I connected much better with the characters especially with Corrine Hammond. Rachel Jones is a lovely young maid caught in a desperation situation. She is an unwilling partner in an evil intrigue of extortion and blackmail with her employers Gerald Moore and Corrine Hammond. Though she would like very much to leave this household, the fear of being arrested along with her employers held her captive. Then Rachel meets the latest victim Lord Adam Burke who has secluded himself after his war injuries and his fiancee's rejection. Will Rachel escape the vile plot and from Gerald Moore's unsavoury lust? Or will she sacrifice her life in order to save Adam? I am very pleased that Lawana has re-written the book and I'm so looking forward to her new contemporary murder-mystery \\"A Table by the Window\\" which will be released next April.

Engaging, intriguing, well-written, and excellent character development; that's what I want to say first about this awesome story. Kristen Heitzmann really outdid herself in this book. She takes you back to Sonoma, California where a young woman named Rese Barrett, as tough as nails and as independent as any woman could be, is fixing up this lovely old villa she happened to buy on an auction. Little did she know that the man she hired was actually the orginial owner's great-great grandson, Lance Michelli. Lance arrives at Sonoma from the Bronx in New York City to fulfill the mission his nonna Antonia had sent him on. What he didn't expect was the secrets he unearthed beneath the carriage house and the tough yet vulnerable young woman who hired him to be a cook/maid for the bed and breakfast she planned to open in the old villa. As Rese begins telling secrets to Lance that no one had ever been able to discover from her, Lance realizes the longer he keeps the secrets he unearthed, the more of the chance Rese would not allow him a place at her villa...and in her heart. Great story. I'm so looking forward to reading the sequel \\"Unforgotten\\" which continues the contemporary story along with a dual time-line in 1931 when Antonia had lived in the villa. Great work, Kristen!	2004-11-25

I must confess, I believe this series is one of the best by Linda Chaikin! I loved the characters. I loved the plot. And I loved the exotic background to the whole story! The future Sir Rogan Chantry of Rookswood estate of Grimston Way, England is searching for the gold his uncle, Henry Chantry had left to him after Henry's supposed suicide. Despite facing his family's opposition and their own plans for him, Rogan sets out on his own to try to find the gold deposit in rich South Africa. His incredible journey to Bulawayo and Salisbury were well-detailed and well-thought out. The description of the colonists' journey admidst the escalating tensions of the natives and the Boers were also well-descripted. In England, Evy Varley has finally accomplished her dream of having her own piano school. But a confrontation with Henry's murderer has left her scarred for life. Will she and Rogan be reunited? Or will they lose the love they had discovered before Rogan left for South Africa? I couldn't put this book down, I finished it in one day. The suspense of finding out who is Henry's killer and Evy's attacker and the impending reunion of Rogan and Evy kept me reading to the satisfying end. But as you know, there is \\"Today's Embrace\\" which will continue the story of Rogan and Evy and their destiny in South Africa so I will definitely buy the third book when it comes out. Linda Chaikin is definitely one of my favourite authors and I can't wait to find out what she has in store for Rogan and Evy and other characters she will create in the near future!	2004-10-18

Bethia Rayborn is the new wardrobe mistress of London's Royal Court Theatre. She accepts a seemingly innocent invitation for a tea outing with her cousin Jewel's cousin Douglas Pearce after the departure of her intended fiance, Guy Russell.

In the heat of anger as he continues to persist, Bethia writes him a scathing letter, sending Douglas off on a wild chase which results his death.

I really like how Linda Chaikin sets up her story in the historical setting of the silver boom in Virginia City. She really did her research on this time period. The characters Rick Delance and Callie Halliday were engaging and lively characters. I admit that I fell in love with the cocky handsome gunfighter because even though Rick was set on avenging his family's deaths, his faith in the Lord was just below the surface.Will he be able to set aside his desire for revenge? He was an awesome example of a manly hero.  Callie Halliday is the beautiful actress who is determined to make it in the theater world of Broadway with the handsome Ashe Perry. After a year of performances in San Francisco, she returns to Virginia City, Nevada to perform in the new theater and to get engaged to her leading man. What she didn't count on were bizarre incidents in which in one she narrowly escapes death...and her renewed attraction to Rick Delance, who was clearly, she thought, was out of her bounds. Her uncle is also insisting that the man she is thinking of marrying was not a Christian. Yet in spite of everything, Callie is determined to make her dreams come true. What will it take for her to realize God's plan for her? Will love shine in the darkness?	2004-08-04

Words cannot describe accurately the way I felt about reading this book. This is now one of my favourite stories by Kristen Heitzmann. She amazed me with her insight into her characters' situations, such as Jill Runyan's desire to re-establish her virtue after her daughter was born, Morgan Spencer's rebel facade actually hiding his regrets and doubts about his salvation, Kelsey's strong unwavering trust in God as she battles cancer and finds her true identity. A heart-breaking story that will also have you cheering in the end. A wonderfully written passionate story about how God could turn our mistakes and turn them into tools for His wonderful plan.

This is one of the best books I have ever read by Kristen Heitzmann. The story of a young woman in a tough situation with everything she has in the world stolen and a cynic yet lovable male character has his life and perspective changed because of her has moved me. Alessi Moore's kindness and optimistic outlook on life, changes the people around her and makes them see how the little good things in life go unnoticed and underappreciated. Steve Bennet is a cynical Christian with a not-so-very-glamourous life either. But his outlook is changed dramatically when Alessi comes into his life. The town of Charity also need to realize that their suppressed secret will still continue to harm innocent people. Will the miracle Alessi anticipated with the appearance of the halo around the sun will take place despite of the underlying attitude of the seemingly quaint town? Awesome story. Kristen Heitzmann is one of my favourite authors and I will read her next story &quot;Secrets&quot; which is coming out this fall and continues the story generations later of Quillan and Carina in the Diamond of the Rockies.	2004-06-24

I thought it would be an interesting plot. But it wasn't. I was disappointed at how slow the plot went. Ms.Wick made Lily's character too naive and too nice. The other characters (Bailey, Evan, Ashton, and Gabe) were all too goody goody. I also disliked Ms.Wick's writing style. It's way too confusing. (I don't know who's thinking what.) I did like how she contrasted the two cultures but it did not tell why Lily's father treated her the way he did.  I did like how she finally stood up to her father at the end when he couldn't accept that she was in love with Gabe. Then the book really loses the steam it had after Gabe and Lily got married. But I did understand that Ms.Wick wanted to tell her readers how they do adoptions in Kashien. So I'm giving this book 2 stars because it had potential and there were some good parts in it. But all in all, it needs some tweaking.	2003-09-10

As the Hallidays travel from California to join him, they became trapped in a fierce winter fighting for survival. Marshal Brett Wilder is also searching for Jack Halliday...but not for the same reason. He is commissioned by the governor to arrest Jack Halliday for a murderer of a card dealer and for crippling Brett's father's arm who was a great surgeon. He rescues Annalee and her family from death. Annalee fights her attraction for the handsome lawman and her illness. She tries to deny the fact that she is not strong but her Lord could use her to have an impact on other people's lives. A great and wonderfull story about a young woman and her feelings of worthlessness and heartbreak and a handsome Brett Wilder who struggles with showing justice and mercy to the people who ruined his and his father's lives. I have news for everyone who likes this book. There is a sequel and it's called &quot;Desert Star&quot; and is due to be published in January!	2003-08-22

This book is one of the best I have ever read by Linda Chaikin or should I say the best I have ever read, period! I loved the setting of South Africa, of the anguish of the Zulu war in 1879 and how the missionaries serving the Lord were martyered. A decade goes by and we find Evy Varley in Grimston Way, England the niece of the local vicar and the daughter of the missionaries who were martyered. Rogan Chantry is the handsome future squire who lives in a maginficent mansion just down the road from Evy's uncle's rectory. I loved the romantic dynamics between Evy and Rogan as they grow up pursuing their dreams. Rogan, to South Africa to locate the gold mine that his deceased uncle had claimed to find. Evy, to become a music teacher. She was expected to marry the curate's son Derwent Brown but in spite of her logic she finds herself growing more and more fond of the squire's son. Rogan, in delving into his family's past, discovers a link from the mysterious Black Diamond to Evy's mother and his uncle Henry. Her mother is accused of stealing the missing Black Diamond. Evy knows this cannot be true so she sets out to prove Rogan wrong. But what she finds out is not what she expects or hoped for; her aunt and uncle had concealed the truth about her parents and that Rogan had his own reasons to seek the missing diamond. A well-written story of danger, romance, mystery and suspense. For all you Linda Chaikin fans out there, I've learned that the sequel to &quot;Tomorrow's Treasure&quot; is called &quot;Yesterday's Promise&quot; and is scheduled to be released in February 2004!	2003-07-09

I have really enjoyed Kristen Heitzmann's first book and series. She does excellent character developement and plot twists that emotionally wraps the reader. What I liked best is that her books are not predictable. You'll never know what she would put upon you next. Young Abigail Martin is a headstrong, determined, feisty and tomboyish woman who loves to call Rocky Bluffs, Colorado her home. She meets aristocratic and sophisticated Montgomery Farrel from South Carolina who stirs the romantic fires in her heart.

Through devastation, murder and the terror of being kidnapped by ruthless outlaws, Abbie grows up to become a changed young woman as she surrenders her destiny and fate to God. Monte will learn also the grace of God and that all things work out good together for those who love God. Though the book is a bit boring in the beginning but you must read on because there is descriptions of the lovely Colorado plains and rugged mountains, the people who struggled to make a living there, the Indians in the Post-Civil War era. I definitely recommend reading this book and the series if you have enjoyed first Kristen's DIAMOND OF THE ROCKIES and Twilight.

Very well researched of a terrifying era.	I enjoyed this book alot. Though this isn't my favourite Linda Chaikin book I still liked it alot. This book is about love for God's Word and between two lovers who risked their lives to translate the New Testament into English when it was forbidden. Justin Brice and Regina Redford are the main fiction characters along with non-fiction character William Tyndale. Justin is sent to Rome to ease the conscience of his sin-tormented father. While in Rome Justin discovers in his daily monk rituals that this is not the way to seek forgiveness for his sins and also dares to translate the Bible from Latin into English. He escapes Rome with his life and makes back to England...to Regina who is promised to a different man. The romance is not the main focus of the story but you will get a deeper appreciation for the people who had risked their lives to bring God's light into the dark world. Admidst betrayal, danger God remains the only true light. I suggest that you read this book so that you will know how it was like to live through that era. I will read it again because it is very well-worth reading more than once.	2003-02-24

I believe this series is one of Linda Chaikin's best that she has ever written. She is great at creating complicated plots that work out smoothly to the end. Jace Buckley, a major in the British army in 1800 India is caught in intrigue that threatens his life, Gem's life and Coral's. He is on a mission to find Coral's missing adopted son but Coral's Uncle Hugo stands in the way of getting to Gem in his own quest for political gain. Coral's heart and mind is set upon building a school for the India's forgotten children, the untouchables. With the help of Dr. Ethan Boswell, she builds the school of her dreams but not without the disapproval of the natives there. Ethan is the man that her family wants Coral to marry. Will Coral find her true love? Will Jace find what his heart is longing for? Can he get to Gem in time? So much to say about this book that will certainly thrill you about the culture of India, how the British lived among the natives and the Hindu religion. Linda Chaikin weaves a great story about love, danger, betrayal and sacrifice in this final book of the HEART OF INDIA trilogy.	2002-09-21

I have read all of the LEFT BEHIND series books and I found that this latest one is not as good as the previous ones. I liked the description on how everyone was on fire at Petra when it was bombed and that no one was injured. I also liked the banter between Abdullah, Mac and Albie. But what bothered me was that Buck and Rayford, the original Tribulation Force members were not much in action. I liked that Chloe got her chance at some action in the assignment in Greece. I thought she deserved that one. I also think though that there were too many pilots on the Trib Force. I mean where are the doctors,lawyers... etc?? More than half of the Trib Force are pilots. I think the authors here should really spruce up on their characters and plots.<br />Nicolae Carparthia is getting more blood thirsty and psychotic everyday. It didn't surprise me during the plague of the sun scorching that Nicolae went outside and sunbathed while his henchmen and employees took refuge underground. But what bothered me was that he also didn't do too much during the 2 and a half years this book went through. What I would really like is Nicolae coming face-to-face with either Buck or Rayford again. I was disappointed in the lack of action. But I still give this 3 stars because the ending is suggesting that the 11th one will be more of a thriller than this one.	2002-09-01

I really loved this book about romance, and honor in the state of Colorado in the Post-Civil war era. Abbie and Monte are great characters and the plot took me off guard a couple of times. I like all of Kristen Heitzmann's books so far. They aren't dull, boring and same old kind of plot all the time. She is doing a great job on her books. Abbie is wondering why Monte's property is being sabotaged and when her determination takes over, a gun battle takes place and the results leaves Abbie devastated and shaken. Monte is being pulled back in the days of the Civil War and there is one enemy he must fight to protect Abbie and his ranch before it is too late. It shows us that God is with us in all we do and will forgive us for our sins. All in all this is one great addition to Kristen Heitzmann's ROCKY MOUNTAIN LEGACY series.

Linda Chaikin did a fantastic job on writing about pirates, buccaneers, the Spanish Inquisition, life in Spain and conflicts that those people faced back then. The main characters Devora and Bruce were well-developed and realistic. I tried to put myself in Devora's slippers to discover how it felt to have a mother that abandoned me, then all of a sudden show up and turn my life upside-down. I really admire someone like Devora who uses her Christian faith to sustain her during her trials. I would like a husband like Bruce who unlike his father is a gallant, dashing, and somewhat roguish man, with a teasing nature. I wonder how it would feel to be a half-English and half-Spanish especially when the two countries were at odds with one another and to be rejected as a little boy by his ruthless father. I definitely going to read this series more than once!	2001-08-29

To her horror, she finds herself interrogated by an handsome officer who stirs the fire of romance. Then the plot gets even more complicated: she finds that she is the only one who is holding the key to locating the information that the two other agents had thought worth dying for. And who is the murderer and the German enemy agent? Great story with an very well-developed, excitable,and complicated plot that is deftly woven into a time when the world will soon be at war. This will keep you on the edge of your seat and won't let you put it down. Follow the adventures of Allison Wescott in her journey with the Lord and as she follows her own heart in her romance with the mysterious British intelligence officer, Bret Holden.  Linda Chaikin deserves an award for this series: LIONS OF THE DESERT. An outstanding, wonderful job!	2000-08-10

I'm usually the kind of reader who like mystery, suspense, danger and that sort of thing, but when I reluctantly started this book, I was drawn into the plot. What I thought was going to be boring turned out to be very interesting and inspirating and not boring at all. Julia is realistic and she sounds like someone who could have lived in the Victorian times in England; a woman who was used to being pampered facing a difficult time when her world came crashing down around her. Andrew sounds like a minister I would like to have in my church, Fiona is like the person I want to be, and Ambrose is someone I would love to talk with. I also like Julia's son Philip who is a normal teenage boy struggling to become a man. Lawana Blackwell weaves all the stories here into one book and it doesn't seem choppy or jumping from 1 character to another. Read this book! I'm sure you will enjoy it!	2000-08-02

This book is about romance, WWII, sisterly love, Paris France, patroitism and courage. Valli and Marc were well-developed characters and the plot was great. Valli also learns that though she is full of grace the grace of God is able to sustain her during her trials and her relationships with her sister Giselle and with the courageous, adventureous Marc Durell. (I found nothing wrong with the romance.) Linda Chaikin did another amazing job to make her latest series A DAY TO REMEMBER more intriguing. I really enjoyed all of the books in this series so far. Mrs. Chaikin did great on the research of the WWII in 1940 when Hitler was on the verge of invading France and North Africa. I like how she goes into other countries that I haven't dreamed of going there. Like Algeria for one and Morrocco. I really, really love to see what's next for this series!	2000-06-04

I am amazed at how easily Linda Chaikin can adjust to writing books from long-time-ago scenario to the 20th century. Her main characters Krista and Jorden are great & well-developed. Krista is a supermodel and has another job: collecting information for her fiance. Little did she know that she is being followed and that there is a mystery surrounding her parents' deaths. Jorden Keller is a Mossad agent/lawyer seeking justice for the atrocities done to Jews in WWII. Krista is stunned to find that her family might have helped Hitler financely and were members of Hitler's Gestapo and Hitler's Youth. What's with the book that Krista was told to buy? There is also another mystery: How did Krista's mother get possession of the ring that Jorden believed was stolen from Stella Cohen's family? Also a accident makes Krista realize that her worth is not in her fair face but what her spirit within. Linda Chaikin did an EXCELLENT job on this book and I'll read it over and over again.	2000-01-08

I learned alot about the Spanish Inquistion, how slaves were brutally treated, how a father could make his own son turn against him, and the Spanish way of life.  Linda Chaikin's TRADE WINDS are similar to her THE BUCCANEERS series, they are not exactly the same.  I'm going to read this book again and again because I believed that Mrs.Chaikin did an excellent job on the research and plot in this book.	1999-11-25
