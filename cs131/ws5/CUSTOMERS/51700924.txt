Unmanned space flight is the poor cousin to human exploration of space but the story behind JPL's many probes sent into space is fascinating.  Those not interested in space may find the book hard going. The end result however, is a greater understanding of the planetary bodies in our solar system and some of the men behind our greatest astronomical discoveries. The book would have merited five stars had Mr Klugar included more photographs and diagrams.	2004-05-22

For me, this book was engrossing from start to end.  I found it hard to put down.  The depiction of suffering inflicted on humanity by itself, at times made for harrowing reading, but was necessary in the context of the retelling of this story.  This is a book that will appeal to those with a genuine interest in military history.  The book focuses much attention on the details of the battle both at tactical and strategic level.  It is this ability of Beevor to shift from a strategic perspective to rendering accounts of the battle at tactical level that provide much of the interest.  The book is full of description of the decision-making processes of the leaders and Generals from both sides.  Complimenting this are stories and anecdotes of individual front line soldiers that anchor this story.  Here he has struck a wonderful balance that maintains interest throughout.  I'm not sure if this book will appeal to non-military enthusiasts, as there is a significant amount of detail about military units and their disposition, movements and performance in the battle. As an account of the suffering that occurred on both sides the book pulls no punches and allocates blame for atrocities to both the Germans and Russians.  Overall this was an excellent read, which I highly recommend.  I'm primed now to read Beevors work on the closing battle of World War II,  \\"Berlin\\".	2003-10-30
US	51700924	ROG81SIJWX37Q	0553578545	336167274	The Emperor's General	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Superb - One of my all-time favourites.	The Emperor's General is set at the end of World War 2 in the Pacific and centres around the American occupation of Japan following the surrender of the Japanese. It tells of the political chess game played out between the Japanese Emperor and General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the allies in Asia. The story is told through the eyes of Captain Jay Marsh, an aide to General MacArthur. The three main characters in the story are Jay Marsh, General MacArthur and number one advisor to the Emperor, Lord Privy Seal Koichi Kido. Although the surrounding events to the story are based on historical facts and the major historical figures did exist, the author James Webb tells us the story is otherwise one of fiction, and the interplay of the characters is drawn from his surmise and deduction. Nonetheless, one can't help but ponder how much Webb has accurately deducted from his research.  I thoroughly enjoy historical novels, but tend to lean towards ones that have a deal of action in them. The Emperor's General has no battlefield fighting and no action in the normal sense of the word contained within the story, so it was going to be a test for me and I think a test for the book to see if it could hold my interest. I wasn't disappointed. This is a beautifully written book. It draws you into the story in such a subtle way that it has a mystical quality to it. Webb has masterfully created the atmosphere of the Asian cities where the story unfolds. Reading about the Philippines, one can feel the prickly heat and the rain soaked roads leading from the capital Manila. The destruction of Tokyo is contrasted vividly with the elegance of the few remaining buildings deliberately left untouched by allied bombing. Webb has portrayed Japanese culture and tradition in a very convincing manner and has woven it into the story intricately. This aspect plays a lead part in the crafting of this story and from this perspective the book will appeal to those with an interest in Asian cultures and is a wonderful introduction to those interested in knowing something about the Japanese psyche. Running parallel to the political mind game being played out in Tokyo, where Captain Jay Marsh is stationed for most of the story, is the romance between Marsh and his Philippine lover Divina Clara. Marsh is torn between his love for Divina and his love for the diplomatic role he plays in the shaping of Japan. The relationship between the young American Captain and the beautiful Philippine woman is a swirling mix of romance, clash of cultures and a surreal Asian atmosphere which is all marvellously rendered by Webb. The unfolding relationship between Marsh, MacArthur and the Lord Privy Seal Koichi Kido is where the obvious drama in this story takes place, but always hauntingly in the background is this yearning romance which culminates the book. My hat is off to the author. This is an engrossing and stunning stage-show penned in the highest calibre. I know these words have been used before to describe this book, but they are so appropriate I feel obliged to reiterate them. The Emperor's General is &quot;sublime, romantic&quot; and utterly mesmerising. &quot;An unforgettable read&quot;.nd is a wonderful introduction to those interested in knowing something about the Japanese psyche.

This book is more well known as \\"An Archers Tale\\", but here New Zealand it has been released under the name Harlequin.  The story is set around the time of the 100 Years War with the main protagonist's being France and England.  Thomas, the son of a priest starts his adventure after leaving England to join the army of King Edward III and do battle in France.  Not only is he there to fight for honour and money, but to recover a sacred relic, a lance stolen from Thomas's village of Hookton, when the French sacked it and killed his father.  Thomas's father is not originally from Hookton and his family heritage is a secret that Thomas is intent on uncovering.  Thomas is an accomplished archer and despite all the gallantry of the Knights, and masses of men-at-arms, it is the English King's common archers that spread fear throughout the French troops, and ultimately determine the outcome of battles.  Cornwell's works of military history, of which his most famous are the adventures of Richard Sharpe, are hugely detailed and infinitely researched.  Although the characters in Harlequin are fictional, many of the battles portrayed actually occurred which adds to the interest of the story.  Cornwell has that magical writer's quality where he can thrust the reader into the era he is writing about.  It's akin to entering a time portal every time you pick up the novel.  Once you are there he puts you in the heart of the battlefield and it's difficult to return to the 21st century without being sickened by the reality of warfare in this dark age.  He pulls no punches with Harlequin and the horrors of battle and the treatment of civilians are vividly rendered.  As with all Cornwell novels and as indicated by the title of the series `The Grail Quest' there is an underlying story evolving with the main character that runs parallel to the fortunes of the army he fights for.  Thomas of Hookton exhibits many of the characteristics of Richard Sharpe.  He is physically strong and tall, he likes his woman and he is an efficient and ruthless adversary in battle.  Above all, Thomas is a flawed character.  I look forward to book two in the series, `Vagabond' to see how Cornwell develops Thomas's personal traits.  This is an era where battles are brutal affairs fought with vicious weapons.  In contrast to this, the traditions of the knights, Lords and other nobles in the story provide an interesting insight into human behaviour.  One moment a soldier can be merciless and cold-blooded and the next moment, a gallant gentleman.  Cornwell explores this human trait nicely and it adds to the flavour of the story.  I enjoyed this book.  I don't rate it up there with the best of the Richard Sharpe books, as I have an affinity with the Napoleonic Wars and with Sharpe himself. If you think the French and English hated one another during this era, wait until the Scots make an appearance in the second book in the series, and be appalled at how they treated one another.

Hero Jack Reacher, an innocent bystander is thrust into a life and death struggle when he is inadvertently taken hostage along with FBI agent, Holly Johnson. Die Trying is not a serious book, despite the subject matter.  Reacher is an implausible former military policeman who is able to single-handedly defeat the hostage takers, raking up an impressive body count along the way. Child has certainly done his research and if you have an interest in the military and the operations of the FBI then aspects of the book will appeal.  He is very descriptive when it comes to weaponry and military equipment.  The book's story line is pretty straightforward with few unexpected twists.  It relies on action to keep you interested, and a `Rambo' type performance is what you get from Jack Reacher. I would recommend this book to action buffs with an interest in the military and FBI.  The story line is ho hum, but if you want a detailed description of what a M16 will do to a human head at 100 yards using 5.56mm calibre bullets designated M855, then look no further than `Die Trying'. If you're after an action packed, thinking person's book with a slick story line, I suggest you try elsewhere.  Something by Gerald Seymour may be of interest. Did I enjoy the book?  Appreciating the book for what it was, yes I did.  I confess it took me a month of picking it up and putting it down for days on end, but it managed to fill in the time on the ferry trip from Half Moon Bay to downtown Auckland.  From my perspective, an average read that was mildly entertaining.  Recommended as a filler.	2003-02-28

So, confession number one out of the way, I saw the movie before reading the book.  Confession number two. I read \\"The Hobbit\\" by Tolkien earlier in the year, but I never finished it.  Somehow, the book and writer failed to maintain my interest, but I am sure I will return shortly and complete that journey.  There are so many different takes and perspectives on this book I thought it beneficial to this review to convey my background to reading this novel. Okay, onto the book itself.  One of the traits of Tolkien I have had to battle with, is his flowery writing, in particular his tendency to burst into song (or at least his characters do) on a very regular basis.  While obviously somewhat relevant to the development of the story and a key part of Hobbit culture, I found the plethora of poetic singing rather tedious at times.  Nonetheless, I have read through most verse, except maybe the longest pieces at 2am in the morning.  Certainly this style of writing will appeal to some and not others, but be forewarned.  It is the mythical worlds that Tolkien has created that really elevate this book to lofty heights, and overshadows any (flowery) flaws the book MAY have in some reader's eyes.  What Tolkien has brought to life is a sumptuous and complex mythical world that really has no comparison.  The depth and detail to which he has gone into, begs the question, 'had Tolkien an all seeing private window into another dimension?'  The many lands, races, languages and creatures are just glorious in all their pageantry and it is all laid out for us in a way which makes us feel that it was always so, and will always be.  The unique storyline is complimented by Tolkien's ability to bring to life emotions such as fear, sadness, terror, and joy along with qualities such as loyalty, bravery, perseverance, doggedness and humility.  The book is literally dripping with all these ingredients.  I personally did not find this book an easy read, it demands attention and a degree of concentration, but the rewards are great.  A masterpiece, truly deserving of classic status.k is literally dripping with all these ingredients.

I found the book very hard to `get into' and halfway through the book, found  I was enjoying the story, but it didn't set me alight with enthusiasm.  The second half of this glorious story however, blew me away.

Sharpe's Company tells the tale of the British Army led by Wellington and the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz.  As usual Sharpe is in the thick of things.  I didn't enjoy this book as much as some of the others, mainly because all the action revolves around the sieges. Personally, I favour action in open country, with battalions of soldiers manoeuvring for tactical advantage and cavalry pitted against infantry. Nonetheless, Cornwell still provides the reader with an articulate depiction of siege warfare, that is grotesque yet mesmerizing.  The detestable Sergeant Hakeswill makes a reappearance and the plot centres around his hatred for Sharpe.  Frankly, I have had a guts-full of Hakeswill and I wish Sharpe would just finish him off and ...... (but I will let you read the story to find that out).  A couple of the fateful encounters Sharpe has with Hakeswill  in this episode of the series, just don't seem to gel, and I'm left with the feeling Cornwell has placed too much emphasis on this aspect of the story. This is a well researched book. The historical notes at the end are very interesting, and some readers might consider reading this part at the beginning or during the book.  Again this book leaves me in no doubt that Bernard Cornwell has had a previous life as an infantryman during the Napoleonic wars.  Recommended for military enthusiasts, but may be too gory for the squeamish at heart.	2002-08-19

If your interest is more serious then this book is a must have.  The authors have put together an outstanding collection of modern day photographs of fully dressed German Soldiers.  World War Two is broken down into different sections: '1939-40 The Blitzkrieg Years','1941-From Crete to Moscow', '1942-The Last Victories', '1943-The Turning Point', '1944-Setbacks on all Fronts', '1945-The Last Stronghold'. The actual quality of the photographs is excellent.  The way the subjects modelling the uniforms are presented is excellent.  The attention to detail is excellent.  As a reference for uniforms and equipment of this period, this book is superb.  I have only read the book as a passing interest and have been captivated by the detailed photographs.  They may have been a fascist regime and guilty of starting a war, but it must be said, the German Soldier certainly had the smartest uniforms of all combatants. I have no doubt, modellers and military enthusiasts will treasure this book.  Highly recommended.	2002-08-13

The book is hardcover, covered black, with a dustjacket depicting a picture of British Infantry storming German trenches.  (I thought it unusual that the cover had a picture on it when the book was a photohistory). The photographs in the book are showing their age somewhat, with many of them being rather blurry and fading, but overall they still convey the scene being photographed adequately.  The plethora of photographs are all numbered with a small black diamond pointing to the actual photograph, which is useful given the number of photographs that can appear on any given page.  Each photograph has a caption which in general is comprehensive, given the little space left in the book after the photographs.  While photography dominates the book, there are sections outlining 'Orders of battle', 'Organizational Tables' and 'Weapons, Badges and Insignia'.  Overall, this is a very interesting book and certainly one that will appeal to persons with an interest in the period. Recommended.	2002-08-13

Covering the period August 1944 to May 1945 the reader is presented with a wide variety of photographs from war torn Europe.  I found the choice of photographs to be very interesting, with quite a few being actual combat footage.  Some of the photographs appear staged for the camera, such as the one on page 116 showing a British soldier trying to pinpoint a German sniper, but otherwise they tend overall to present an interesting and historically accurate portrayal of this period of World War 2.  Flicking through these photographs it highlights to me how well researched the movie 'Saving Private Ryan' was.  Some of the shots in this book could have come out of the movie.  An interesting read.

The pages are all high quality gloss which is a pleasure to handle.  The book gives a history of 200 of military leaders rated by the authors as having contributed significantly or featured prominently in world military affairs.  The leaders appear alphabetically throughout the book and at the beginning, a chronological listing by date of birth is provided.  What is most satisfying about the book is that each leader is given a very good description of his personality and achievements.  Despite there being 200 entries we are still provided with ample information on each leader.  Most of the entries are for field commanders but a few 'ifluential theorists and administrators&quot; such as Clausewitz, Steuben, and Carnot appear.  Although there is not a picture or photograph of every leader, the book has many, and I particularly like the authors choice of photographs for the book.  Pre-photography days are covered by pictures and drawings of leaders.  All photography and pictures are black and white.  Overall, this is an excellent general source of information on military leaders.  It is the sort of book you can pick up now and again after you have read it through and read up on a leader that interests you.  Well written. Recommended as a purchase.	2002-08-05

There is also informative accompanying text, but the photographs take up the larger proportion of the pages.  The photographs are all numbered and are easily referenced by the number to the notes describing each photograph.  Interestingly, war photography during this period does not include many phtographs of actual combat, particularly close combat. Photography still being in its relative infancy and the perilous nature of raising ones head above a trench, probably account for this.  The reader is presented with hundreds of photographs which serve to give a sense of what it was like for the soldiers during World War One.  There are very few diagrams in this book.  For a more detailed look at World War One in a similar format check out The &quot;Historical Atlas of World War I&quot; by Anthony Livesey, H. P. Willmott (Editor).  &quot;Chronicles of the Great War&quot; is an interesting read but is not as comprehensive as the &quot;Historical Atlas of World War I&quot;.

Roze captures the deep sadness and utter futility of 'The Great War' with photos of the battlegrounds as they are today.  These are accompanied by smaller photographs from the era itself, of which the majority are of soldiers in the trenches.  There is also comprehensive text describing the photographs and historical background.  The modern photographs are really breathtaking in how they convey the solemnity of what they are actually portraying.  World War One is a not an often visited subject, both in literary or movie form, which in some respects is a shame.  The scale of horror endured by the men on both sides is really staggering.  To have the significance of this lost with new generations is like turning a blind eye to a lesson that should not be forgotten.  This is an attractive publication and is highly recommended for those interested in the history of World War One, with emphasis on how the battlegrounds of old have aged.	2002-07-19

Both in its size and the wealth of information therein.  You need to be sitting at a desk or table to be able to comfortably read this book.  That aside, the amount of information it contains is vast.  Although a novice can pick up this book and benefit from a read, many will probably find the text too technical.  This is a book I return to often and always learn something new.  It contains hundreds of photographs and graphs to compliment the text.  Don't be mislead into thinking this is an atlas, as it is not.  It really is a comprehensive illustrated encyclopedia of astronomy.  If your after an atlas head to &quot;The Cambridge Atlas of the Stars by Wil Tirion&quot; or &quot;Sky Atlas 2000.0: Deluxe by Wil Tirion, Roger W. Sinnott&quot; for the two best available.  Recommended.	2002-07-06

I didn't read any other of Neale/God's books for some time.  I continually returned to these books for inspiration, guidance and upliftment and they are a great source to help one remember who we really are, particularly at times when life seems a little heavy.  I was fortunate to hear Neale speak on his visit to New Zealand and he masterfully reinforced all that he and God had written in books 1,2 and 3.  Even after that event I still wasn't motivated enough to read their book &quot;Friendship with God&quot;.  It wasn't until my wife bought the book home from the library for me unexpectedly that I read it.  I must of subconsciously thought that because the first three books were so unbelievably magnificent that &quot;Friendship with God&quot; couldn't possibly be better or contain anything new.  Well, it wasn't better, (you can't better the plain truth). But just as inspirational? Yes.  Just as helpful? Yes. Just as enlightening? yes. &quot;Friendship with God&quot; is right up with all his other books, simply unmissable if you are seeking the truth about existence.  As a bonus their are some really useful tools explained by God to assist us getting in touch with ones true self.  And the best of all, God's wit is still there.  He has a keen sense of humour which pops up occasionally, and makes this book a fun read.  These books have a habit of appearing in your life at exactly the appropriate time.  Well done Neale.  Well done God.  Good effort from both of you.  Keep it up.	2002-07-03

This is an off-beat, relaxed story about a family holidaying in South East Asia.  Donna,  a disillusioned unpatriotic American with her French husband Pierre, along with  their 8 year old daughter are seeking a life away from stress and looking for life (somewhere) in  Paradise.  They settle on a Greek Island only to find life in winter is not what they remember of the Greek Islands.  From one disaster to another, they announce enough is enough. They  travel to Thailand and Malaysia to get away from the Greek winter and to also follow a lifelong dream and discover `the real Asia'.<br />What follows is a witty and exotic account of  her survival in an unfamiliar environment,  with a sick husband and young daughter.  Carrere humoursly expresses a neurotic fight between her protective maternal instincts and their struggle for survival within a different culture.  I picked up this book and finished it in one day.  I had a couple of laughs, and  it was humourous enough to make me smile now and then. I found it easy light reading, almost a short story more than a novel.  The plot was really set out like a diary of one disaster after another from monkeys, to chicken legs for dinner, to violent rain-forest outbursts, to tacky male tourists looking for `love', and `girls who need to eat' (young prostitutes).  This book is a good light read,  although its not long enough to entertain for more than a couple of days.	2002-07-01

What impresses me most about this book is the quality of the maps.  There are more than 100 colour maps which trace the development of the major campaigns with unprecedented clarity.  Along with the maps there are numerous photos and drawings which are all easily read and understood. The accompanying text is detailed but not overbearing. Overall this is a lovely reference of World War One which is very nicely balanced in its presentation. It also makes an informative accompaniment to the World War One grand strategic boardgame, 'Paths of Glory' by Ted S Racier of GMT games.  This is a boardgame which those interested in reading this book may wish to explore.  It is one of the best grand strategic boardgames available.	2002-07-01

If you can get a revised and updated version then ignore the above comment. I found this book more of a history of the game, rather than an encyclopedia.  If you are looking for detailed statistics, then look elsewhere.  This book focuses on a history of the players, teams and coaches.  In that respect it is a very enjoyable read.  The book is divided into 16 sections. The major sections of the book include - 'The NBA Teams', 'Legends of the NBA', 'The Great Players' and 'The Great Coaches'.  Other sections include 'The NBA Draft', 'The Hall of Fame', 'The NBA All-Star Game' and others.  Plenty of black and white and colour photos are included in the book and there are six pages of NBA records at the rear of the book.  This is a hardcover book with, you guessed it, Michael Jordan, featured on the front.  It also comes with a glossy dustjacket. Enjoyable read, but for a definitive book of this type look no further than Basketball : The Legends and the Game<br />by Vincent M. Mallozzi.	2002-05-27

Griet, the main character, was  often frustrating with her withdrawn  manner and lack of confidence in herself. This itself is probably a reflection of her status in society in 17th century Europe.  I found it disappointing that the painter himself was not really brought into the story as well as he could have been.  We only  were given an indepth look into Griet's character, and the story was seen soley from her perspective.  The plot was luke warm around the relationship of Griet (his maid) and the painter, but we discover that Griet has an artistic ability, that adds light to an otherwise monotonous plot.  I was drawn to reading this book by the idea behind it. It is a good, light read, and one which I recommend .	2002-05-27

A young man visits his old dying teacher, and learns more about life than he bargains for. It is one of those books, that can be a catalyst for a life-changing experience for a reader.  At the very least it can wake you from the doldrums of life and encourage you to take a long hard look at yourself, and examine where you are personally heading along lifes treadmill.<br />With 191 pages, and the lines well spaced out, it is easy to get into and doesn't take very long to read.

US	51700924	R3295PRLJ6M9R5	0553381393	282597222	Tides of War	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Excellent portrayal of the Peloponnesian War	Coming on the heels of the brilliant `Gates of Fire', `Tides of War' is another epic novel centred around ancient Greece, this time focusing on the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta.  To put this review into perspective, let me just say that I rate Pressfield's previous novel `Gates of Fire' as one of the finest works in its genre and certainly one of my all time favourite books.  So, for me, `Tides of War' held high expectations, yet I knew it was going to have a hard job if it were to be anywhere near as good as `Gates of Fire'.  As in the first novel, `Tides of War' tests the reader ability to grapple with Pressfield's interpretation of the ancient Greek language.  I found it a little disconcerting in the first novel, but wholly acceptable in the context of the story. In `Tides of War' I have to admit, Pressfields presentation of the ancient Greek way of speaking is beautiful, yet it did test my ability to stay focussed on what the characters were meaning to say.  As in `Gates of Fire' his description of the battles is first class, albiet many are naval in this book. I found the story quite long, which is probably perfectly applicable given the length of the Peloponnesian Wars.  It didn't excite me as much as `Gates of Fire' and I reluctantly admit I struggled through a couple of chapters where things slowed down a little too much for my liking.  This book however is a very worthwhile read, but I would expect many readers will find it's style very difficult and consequently the book may be hard going.  It is not as easy to read, nor as utterly gripping as `Gates of Fire' is.  In some respects had Pressfield not written that novel then this would have been a sure winner with me.  As it is `Gates of Fire' has set such a lofty standard that any novel of the same genre, will in the future be judged in comparison to it.  Recommended.	2002-05-27

Not only so for the characters who are on a great trek across Ice Age Europe, but also for the reader. We have followed Ayla, the main character, through three previous books.  It seems impossible that Auel can add any more detail to the plethora of research she has done for her previous books, but again we are introduced to so much more about pre-historic Europe in this chapter of Ayla's life.  There are many more tribes of people that we meet, and many more discoveries are made.  I loved this book and recommend it and the whole series to any interested readers.  This is an outstanding read from a truly gifted author.	2002-05-27

Ayla meets up with her first clan of people, the Mammoth Hunters, who are at first hostile, and then come to love her.  Her love with Jondolar is tested and she learns new skills and abilities.

If my memory serves me correct this was his first, or one of his first books.  I thoroughly enjoyed Harry's Game, concerning the IRA and it's struggle with the English. It's certainly not as polished as his later offerings, but Seymour still manages to grip you with his ability to get into the underbelly that was and is the Irish conflict.  An interesting read for fans of Seymour who haven't explored his early offerings, and a gound sound read for all. Recommended.	2002-05-24

Accordingly many of the photographs may have been superceded by more recent shots from Hubble, and recent developments with the telescope are not covered. That aside, I found this book an interesting read. Of particular interest is the coverage of the early days of the telescope and the scandal over the faulty optics.  The comparative before and after photographs of the faulty and corrected optics are also fascinating.  There are a large number of photographs in the book which really lends itself well to sitting on the coffee table and occassional viewing.  The book is plain black hardcover with a glossy dustjacket. It is set in landscape view and I'm not quite sure what it is but the layout of the book doesn't really gel together that well.  I would recommend prospective purchasers check out the book in a library before purchasing to see if it meets their requirements.  This book would have received a higher rating in 1996, but it is showing its age now.  Check it out first.	2002-05-24

It is a large hardcover book with a glossy front and glossy dustjacket.  It features about 300 of basketballs all time great players.  Each featured player is allocated a page which has some narrative about the player and his career.  There is a 'fact file' on each player which lists : Birthdate, height, length of NBA career, major teams, records/awards.  Each feature also had a large photo, generally of the player in action and a smaller photo of the player where available.  The photos are in glorious colour apart from the earlier photos of legends such as 'Pistol Pete' Maravich.  There are also a number of 'special features' in the book highlighting some great basketballing moments. Full of facts and action photos this book will not disappoint basketball fans.  For the older reader this book will bring back fantastic memories.  I can't recommend this book highly enough. Superb, essential purchase for basketball and sporting fans alike.	2002-05-23

The author of this book utilised the efforts of Honore de Balzac who 150 years previously had researched this battle with a view to writing this book.  Rambaud has done a commendable job portraying the battle and the reader is cartwheeled headlong into combat and into the Aspern-Essling battlefield. Napoleonic battlefields were anything but glorious and this is conveyed by Rambaud who gets down to the nitty gritter of warfare.  I  enjoyed the book, especially the description of combat itself.  The depiction of characters such as Napoleon and his marshalls was also interesting.  Overall, this was a good read.  It does not match the fantastic battle scenes depicted in Stephen Pressfields 'Gates of Fire' (few books ever will) but it doesn't pull any punches either about the horrors of war. The hardcover version has a plain tan cover and a glossy dust jacket featuring a rather dashing Napoleon on a white steed. The cover notes that the book was a 'Winner of the Prix Goncour and Grand Prix du Roma de L'Academie Francaise' awards. Recommended.	2002-05-23

It is set on Pre-historic earth and follows her life from being found as a five year old to becoming a young woman and leaving the clan.  Life is a struggle for Ayla, and she finds it very difficult to fit in with the ways and customs of the clan.<br />Basically it is a struggle for survival in a harsh ice-age world, and I found myself fascinated with the real historical world that Jean has researched and written about.  I couldn't get enough of it and I have since read the following four books.  Thoroughly recommended.	2002-05-21

I have to confess to being very bored with the first part of this book. Unlike her other books, which I was able to read long into the night, after about two pages reading each night of this one, I had trouble staying awake. It took me about 3 months to work through \\"The Fiery Cross\\" but the saving grace was, that things started to improve towards the latter stages of the book. I felt however, that Claire & Jamie's relationship had been dragged out to the bitter end, and to be quite honest, I felt as though I wouldn't be very upset if a wild Grizzly bear broke in and killed them both (it would have been a little more exciting). Perhaps I have been harsh here, as Gabaldon's previous books have been nothing short of outstanding, and I suppose anything short of her best is really surprising.  Then again, an average book by Diana would in many cases be considered something very special by any other author. So overall, this is a long read which lacks the excitement and energy of the previous instalments, but still has that remarkable attention to detail and atmosphere so characteristic of this author.  Slow in the beginning but picks up later.  Still a must read for fans of this author, but as a first time Gabaldon reader I suggest you start with an earlier book in the saga.	2002-05-17

The fascinating aspect that this book focuses on is that the client in question recalls experiences that identify him as an extra-terrestial being.  The book catalogues his past experiences on alien planets and on earth and attempts to unravel the connections between them.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I am a discerning reader and do not believe everything I read and certainly this book pushes the boundaries between fact and fiction.  Draw whatever conclusions you want from this book.  Whatever your belief system, it provides some valuable lessons.  Those in the 'KNOW' will benefit greatly from this book, as it is a real wake up call.  It may also be of assistance to victims of alien abductions as an alternative explanation for their experiences.  I found this book an easy and quick read as most of the text is in question and answer format. Watch out for the revelation at the end as to the past life of the subject which lead to his present incarnation.  About as an impressive job as you can get. Highly recommended.	2002-05-16

If you are deeply analytical, or very religious, then you will have great difficulty here. The churches will absolutely loathe it, for it instantly shatters their world which so many millions believe is the truth.

For heavens sake, only god fearing men and women who preach in richly ornate churches, and belong to religions that for centuries have been corrupt can truly preach the word of god.

Each period is prefaced with the heading &quot;Ancient Authorities&quot; and outlines where the following information is sourced. Then the period is discussed in flowing narrative which highlights the key personalities and events of the time along with an indepth look at the mechanics of warfare. The strategy and tactics presented is blended nicely with the historical discussion. The numerous battle maps and accompanying data are a treasure for the military, history and wargaming buffs. The artwork throughout is first class as are the maps. I particularly like the full page colour depictions of combatants from different armies with detailed explanatory notes, some of the best I've seen. I found the middle part of the book focussed a little more heavily on the historical aspect. It did not contain as many battle maps as the first and latter part did, and I found myself flicking ahead to see when I would reach one of the battle descriptions and maps. In summary, this is a terrific encyclopedia and ranks as one of the nicest books I have seen on the subject. Superb.	2002-01-05

The map at the front of the edition I have showing the deployment and subsequent tactical redeployment of the opposing forces makes a nice accompaniament to Cornwell's depiction of how Wellington deployed his forces.	2001-05-13

A good rollicking read and it's not hard to imagine that Cornwell spent a previous incarnation trudging through India with a trail of bibbis behind him.	2001-05-13

I have found this book to be useful in providing detail about all the areas in the title &quot;organization, tactics, dress and weapons&quot;. The sections on dress and equipment can be a little tedious but provide an excellent reference.  I enjoyed the section on the major battles of the period but found the descriptions a little short, but that I dare say is another book in itself. As a general reference for the period the author has done an excellent job.	2000-10-07

Given its age, it has wonderful colour photographs of masses of Napoleonic troops battling out on wargames tables.  The rule system set out by Grant is now dated but this hardcover book has been a welcome part of my wargaming literature for many years and is a worthy addition to any library on the subject, for the photographs alone.	2000-10-07

God's humour is what delights me most about book 3.  What a wit (s)he is.  Look, I said it all in the heading so I'll make this quick. Read this book, it's my duty to tell you.  If you don't like it, or hate it, fine, you are not ready (I'm not trying to be condascending or anything, but a fact is a fact) For those that read it, and 'get it', &quot;isn't this like discovering life on Pluto, sort of thing?&quot;  Wooooah, thanks Neale Donald Walsch.  Heck, how's this going to look on my review resume`?	2000-10-07

I recomended it to many friends, most of who enjoyed it also.  Don't touch this book though a) if you are you are a skeptic (stick to something more scientific and tangible and languish there where you feel comfortable), b) are offended by simple truths, c) are more deeply concerned whether the book is fiction or non-fiction than the message within d)if you can't get your head round the fact that despite outward appearances all humans belong to one race.  For readers with an open mind, you may or may not enjoy the book, but there is a message within for everyone if you care to look.	2000-10-07

This was the first Pressfield book I have read, and I enjoyed it enormously.  The battle depictions coupled with his style of writing allowed me to get into the soul of the Spartan,  and forced me stay up till  the early hours on a number of nights until I finished this book. Despite  the mixed reviews coming in for &quot;Tides of War&quot;  I will certainly  be purchasing that book, if nothing more than to support Pressfield for  this excellent effort.	2000-07-25

I enjoyed the book, and the picture  of the world it painted.  I was a little disappointed with the story  itself, it didn't seem to go anywhere in the end.  I identified a few links  to some of the prophecy cards, but i would have enjoyed the book a lot more  had the book been closer linked to the characters in the card game.	2000-07-18

If you are deeply analytical, or very religious, then you will have great  difficulty here. The churches will absolutely loathe it, for it instantly  shatters their world which so many millions believe is the truth. It must  be unthinkable and blasphemy for them that the true prophet could converse  to the masses through a lowly person such as the author of this book.  For  heavens sake, only god fearing men and women who preach in richly ornate  churches, and belong to religions that for centuries have been corrupt can  truly preach the word of god.  It really is so simple, yet most of us will  denounce this book, because if we don't, we will probably go to hell and  sit forever polishing the shoes of a guy holding a pitch fork and has horns  sticking out of his head, while we sweat profusely........shudder shudder.	2000-07-18
US	51700924	RC3030WMUI6RZ	0837157110	460289688	The Struggle for Europe.	Books	5	12	13	N	N	brilliant	I attended the New Zealand Armed Forces Staff Course in 1997 and had to read numerous books on military history.  None of them were as engrossing and well written as Chestor Wilmonts Struggle for Europe.  This has been on  my bookshelf for many years and I have read it twice.  A terrific expose of  the second world war in Europe. Chester draws you into the war as if you  were there on D Day, and turns what could have been a very boring strategic  overview of the war into an indepth study which keeps you wanting to read  more.	2000-05-10

Okay I'm only halfway through the book, but this is the best read I've had for a while.  Absolutely fascinating, well written and insightful.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of South Africa and or the strength of human spirit.  My next book will be one  written by someone who supported aparthied.  I am very interested to see  some arguments in support of the system Nelson fought against.	2000-05-01

At every stage of the book it has clearly explained the current topic and the chapters flow nicely together.  The author seems to have been able to get into the mind of the  beginning C programmer, and answers all those nagging questions. Every  question the book raises for me is answered. I am really enjoying this  book, I like its style and approach, and best of all it is actually  teaching me something.  Well done.	1999-05-01

I now have Linux up and running on a dual boot machine with no problems.  The installation was straight forward, but I  feel that had problems occured the book wouldn't have had enough detail to  help me overcome them.  An easy to read book that doesn't go into any real  depth, but can get a new user up and running relatively quickly.	1999-03-25
