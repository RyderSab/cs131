After all, it was her life.  I'm sorry that she could not break away from him.  <br /> <br />I found it interesting to read about the amount of money he was paid and how they spent it all.  He probably realized he wasn't going to live to be old.	2005-04-25

I was really hooked when I read that the main character was an orphan who was named Oswald T.(for tomato)Campbell for the can of soup that was in the basket when he was left outside of the orphanage. <br /> <br />I grew up in the country near a small town and now again live in the country. There are the usual characters as in Lost River, AL. <br /> <br />We have at least two resident cardinal couples here year round and they are at the feeders every day.  They aren't as friendly as Jack.  However, I'll think of him when I see them from now on. <br /> <br />A great book with happy endings for all. <br /> <br />	2005-04-22

You wouldn't think this would make a difference, but it does. <br /> <br />The only thing I can say is that you had to have been there to completely understand this book.

There wasn't much I hadn't read before, but I did enjoy the never-before-seen photographs.<br />If the book is a bit dull, it is because the subject is.  The Queen isn't terribly interesting or exciting. I think she is a nice person.  A good Christian and very good at her duties which she takes very seriously.  Maybe that is enough. I think she relates better to animals than to her family, but that doesn't make her a bad person.	2004-04-30

It is beautifully illustrated with pictures of the author's home nicely decorated for Christmas.  She uses natural things like pine cones and branches painted gold, ribbons, etc.  Photographs of her home and family are so nice.  The recipes are written for U.S. kitchens, too. <br />She begins with a family party at a hotel in Cornwall and then describes Christmas in Scotland.  A short story finishes the book.

Writing this account kept him sane.<br />There were many quite awful moments with petty rules to learn about the routine and who to avoid.<br />Also some funny moments like the prison librarian coming to scold him for signing his books which prisoners had taken from her library never to be seen again.<br />I recommend this book to everyone who wants to know what prison life is like.	2003-08-26

The details of daily living in prison are dreadful.  Such petty rules.  I can't imagine conditions are much better in the U.S.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what really goes on behind bars.  His habit of writing every day saved him.

Jessica fills in the details of her story, which has been told in other books, but this in her own words.  She wrote with wit and humor.<br />It was fun to read about her plotting to run away from home.  She was the bravest of the bunch I think.  <br />The travels in America are interesting to read.  Her observations of Americans are on the mark.  I was tickled to read how she enjoyed central heating in country houses here considering the cold houses the Mitfords lived in.<br />In the last chapter she tells of her love for her husband which is very touching.	2003-07-27

I grew up in the Midwest in the 40's and 50's and that's the way it was. Younger folks may not understand that.

I remember stopping in the telephone office to use the phone to call my grandmother.  The operator, who you gave the phone number to and she would make the connection at her switchboard inside said, &quot;Oh, she's not home.  I saw walking by a little bit ago.&quot;  That was one good thing about small towns.  The bad I won't mention.<br />I loved Neighbor Dorothy.  We had two such ladies to listen to.<BR>Leanna Driftmier, not Driftmiller as the author wrote on page 14, on &quot;Kitchen Klatter&quot; and Wynn Speece as &quot;The Neighbor Lady&quot;.<br />There were several other errors such as the Gateway Arch date in St. Louis, but these are errors an editor should have caught.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the conversations and the observations.  Like those in the barber shop where no one saw themselves as the middle aged men they were.  They remembered themselves as the little boys they still were.<br />Bobby Smith's trip back to his friend Monroe's funeral was very touching.  It was a turning point in his life.<br />I recommend this book highly for its humor and telling it like it used to be.  If you didn't grow up near or in a small town you may not understand it.

Some were White House employees.  She has written an introduction to each article which is helpful.<br />There are many interesting stories never seen before.  I especially liked the articles of behind the scenes preparations for the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1939 by White House employees.  Eleanor Roosevelt's article is different than the one she has in her book as it does not include the stop at Hyde Park.<br />Mamie is presented as a difficult taskmaster by the White House seamstress.  All good reading.<br />I don't know if young folks will enjoy this book as much as I did, but they should give it a try.<br />Only objection.  There were not enough pictures!	2003-01-17

Philip missed a lot of signals and not only from her.  He didn't realize that his mother had another man friend and wasn't really feeling jilted by Gerard.  Philip seemed too tied up with himself to notice what others were doing. <br />Interesting story of how it all ended with mistaken identities and lack of communication.  A winner, however.	2002-12-03

I did not know how the term would be worked into a mystery story.  I soon learned much to my enjoyment.<br />I did not feel sorry for Lisa and the way she was over-protected by her mother.  That was her life and the only one she knew.  I thought that soon something would happen and she would be able to become a part of the real world.<br />I thought the way the author handled the things that Lisa gradually found out about was done very well.  Never going to school or having friends her age, etc. must have been difficult, but then she did not know anything else.<br />I was pleased with the ending.  You just know that Lisa went on and made a success of her life.  Not the usual Rendell ending which usually is in chaos with the police car at the door.	2002-12-03

I got out my map of London to pinpoint the location as she described the streets around Regent's Park.  I was there some years ago, but had forgotten just how it is laid out.<br />Her characters were wonderfully complicated as usual.  They weren't quite what they seemed.  Mary was rather naive and sheltered, but believable.  I was happy she could defy her boyfriend, Alstair, who came across as a control freak.  I liked the way Roman and his reasons for being on the streets were explained not all at once, but gradually.  If only we knew the stories behind those we see on the streets we might feel compassion towards them.<br />Mr. Bean, the dog walker, was great as a snobbish ex-servant.  He was just eccentric enough to make you wonder how many more are there like him?	2002-11-26

I would have liked to read more about her childhood from her point of view.  Nancy's stories about it were from another vantage since she was 16 when Deborah was born.<br />I wasn't bored by this book at all.  Have been reading about the Mitfords this summer and fall and am interested in their way of life which is so different than mine.<br />I don't mind the footnotes telling who people are.  Some I knew, others I had never heard of.  I didn't think the use of footnotes was excessive, but then I read a lot of books that have footnotes so am not concerned about them. <br />The Duchess has been very successful with managing Chatsworth House and I admire her for that.  Her wit and wisdom come through as she writes matter-of-factly about her life.  She doesn't sound stuffy at all.  I wish I could visit Chatsworth and meet her.	2002-11-19

I loved the ending where the bad guy forgets one very important detail and can't do anything about it.  We assume that he will be caught, but don't know for sure.<br />What I like about this book was that the characters seem to be normal, but they are anything but.  It makes one wonder what ones neighbors might really be doing.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a great story.	2002-11-15

Got hooked and went back to &quot;A&quot;.  It's interesting to see how her detective, Kinsey Millhone, has developed over the years.<br />I believe Sue is keeping her placed in the 80's before cell phones, DNA, computers, etc.  I love the continuing lines about her landlord, Henry, the VW she drives, her one black dress.  I cannot make a peanut butter and pickle sandwich, tho.<br />I enjoyed this book because it is based on a true story.  That the victim is still not identified does not take anything from the story.  Kinsey's detective friends are funny and I was tickled at her lesson in ironing a shirt that she gave one.  That's the way I iron a shirt!  The fast food binges made me hungry.<br />I wrote to Sue many years ago.  She and Kinsey send a Christmas card each year and I get an advance notice about new books coming out and where Sue will be signing them.  She always sends a token gift.  For &quot;M is for Malice&quot; it was a key chain with the letter M encased in plastic attached.

Another I spent reading all I could find on the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.  This was my Mitford summer.<br />It began with Mary Lovell's, &quot;The Sisters&quot; and I've read most of the Mitford biographies and novels that I could find.<br />I am enjoying this book for the letters and pictures.  The footnotes don't bother me because I know who most of the people are from my reading of English history.  French phrases don't bother me because I know enough French to be able to understand them altho it is nice to have translations given.<br />I believe young readers may have a problem with this book because they do not understand how it once was.  I was a small child during WWII and didn't suffer as much as people in England did.  The Mitfords were a wonderfully strange family and readers probably should read Mary Lovell's book first as background.<br />I love Nancy's sharp observations and style.  It saddens me that she didn't like Americans.  I wonder why.  I believe she was one of the most interesting of the Mitford sisters, but they were each special in their own way.  I am just so sorry she had such a painful illness at the end. It was very sad to read of her last days.	2002-10-05

Mary Todd Lincoln ran up clothing bills that she tried to hide---just like Jackie.<br />Other stories that I found amusing were that Nixon would not allow guards or policemen to speak to him or Mrs. Nixon.  Betty Ford couldn't understand why they ignored her greetings until this was explained to her.<br />Ronald Reagan served tea to Prince Charles who did not touch it because, as he explained later, he didn't know what to do with the little bag!<br />Many such amusing stories made this a truly enjoyable book.

Some really hated the book and others loved it.  <BR>I read the book a couple of years ago and liked it.  I don't understand the hateful reviews.<br />You know, of course, that an arsonist destroyed the Cedar Bridge on Tuesday, 3 September, 2002. That's why I decided to read the book again.  I was in Iowa at the time of the movie premiere in 1995, but did not attend any events connected with it.<br />A comment on page 78 reflects the view of the average Iowan.<BR>\\"And why in the world would anybody wanna take pictures of 'em?<BR>(The covered bridges.)  They're just all fallin' down in bad shape.\\"  I grew up a few miles north of Madison County, Iowa, and never went to see the wooden bridges. <br />One thing that I noticed the author missed was I am sure that neighbors noticed Kincaid's pickup at the Johnson farm.  In a rural community there are no secrets.  There was no mention of him parking the truck out of sight.  Someone must have seen it.<br />I think city slickers may have had trouble with this story, but we real people did not.	2002-09-08

I thought it was dreadful the way these supposedly upper class families treat their employees.  What is worse is how the nannies and others put up with it.<br />I believe this book was made up from several experiences with different families.

Have read all of Nancy's novels, this being the last.<br />I loved it for the way she poked fun at the French and English, too.  A reviewer on 1/3/2000, I believe it was, missed the whole point.  The characters in this book aren't vapid.  They are upper class English and French who quietly carry on affairs.  Everyone knows, but no one talks.  Well, they do among themselves, but we peasants aren't to know.<br />I did not have trouble with the few French phases here and there as I read French.  They were not as numerous or long as in some of her other books.<br />Grace may not have been the smartest person in the world, but it was a good story.  I felt sorry for her at the dinners where she was unaware of the undercurrents going on around her.  Her father was also an interesting character.<br />&quot;The Blessing&quot; otherwise known as Sigismund was an awful child, but with a name like that what could you expect?  When you think about it the title is a joke as he certainly didn't seem to be a blessing. I wonder what other terrible things he did as he got older?	2002-08-28

I liked \\"The Pursuit of Love\\" best, but both were excellent in describing life in England between the wars for this eccentric upper class family.  There were many laugh-out-loud moments as another reviewer has written.  <br />I would suggest that you read Lovell's book first so you know the background of some of the events.

I am a few years past 50 and can see why younger readers would be confused.  Unless you lived during WWII you cannot begin to appreciate this story.<br />I did not know much about the Mitford sisters altho was aware of Jessica, Nancy and Diana.  I did not realize until I read this book that Unity lived so long after her suicide attempt.<br />It is a book that gives an excellent view of a time and way of living that is now gone.  The Mitfords were cash poor, but managed trips, coming out seasons, servants for their various homes, etc.  It is difficult for us to understand that way of life.  The Mitford parents might seem eccentric, but they were not that unusual really for their class.   <br />Many photographs added interest to this book.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in history and how life was lived in England during WWII.	2002-07-28

It's where we went shopping on Saturday nights and watched the news reels about the war at the movies.  Those newsreels and LIFE magazine brought WWII to us.<br />This is a great story.  You wonder how these people managed to produce all of the food.  What a sight it must have been for the fellows when they got off the train and saw the tables piled high.  I liked the details such as china cups being washed and sent back from the next station, etc.  And how they just packed food in baskets and nothing spoiled.  The idea of putting names on a piece of paper in a popcorn ball was great.<br />I've driven across Nebraska to and from Denver several times and also have ridden on the train.  This book brought it all back to me.  <br />This a book everyone should read.  It shows the real America and how everyone pulled together during WWII.	2002-07-16

James and Ruth Rendell, are more my cup of tea, but I have enjoyed the few books I've read by Mary Higgins Clark.<br />I thought this story moved along quickly.  I read it in two sittings.  There was no big surprise ending, but more details  surrounding the death of the narrator's sister were revealed when she came back to investigate years later.  I think people told her more than they normally would, but this is fiction  after all.  I liked the first person writing.<br />I believe too many reviews have criticized this book because it wasn't what they thought it should be.  If the author was happy with it, let it be.	2002-07-11

However, the author has given us so much background and detail on what was going on in England at this time that I will say those parts were enjoyable!<br />It seems unbelievable that the government apparently had not done much advance planning.  It's as if no one thought the Queen was going to die.  I was reminded of the smooth operation of the Queen Mother's funeral in April where everything went like clockwork.  Queen Victoria had given a few orders for her funeral, but the details were left to others with the usual squabbling.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the British Royal family.	2002-06-28

Also the writer has known her personally for twenty years.<br />I was disappointed and am glad that I borrowed it from my library.

However, my small town in the Midwest wasn't quite so provincial as Knockglen.  There were no Catholics and we didn't worry about class.<br />There were too many references to Benny's large frame.  Once or twice would have been enough.  I felt sorry for her as the over-protected only child of a very boring couple.  Thank goodness she escaped to Dublin.<br />Simon was a real rat, but so I'm not surprised at the way he treated Nan.  He obviously intended to marry money and she didn't have any.<br />I liked all of the different characters, except Sean.  All types seemed to be there.  Mother Francis was very kind to Eve and everyone.<br />I don't plan on seeing the movie after other reviewers have said what characters were left out and that the ending was different.  I liked the way it ended.	2002-05-13

I have read many other biographies of Queen Elizabeth II, but there were some<br />new details presented here.  Nothing shocking or in bad taste.<br />The author has written fairly about a woman whose life we cannot imagine.  You wonder how she has managed to cope these years.<br />I came away with the belief that the powers that are behind the throne, the men in grey, should be eliminated or at least brought into this century.  However, tradition is what keeps Elizabeth going and where would she be without it?	2002-03-18

I had not heard much about any of them.  Texas folks probably would like to read about them, but I found them boring.  I've given it five stars for her writing.<BR> <BR>There are some interesting things about how retail stores have changed over the years and how customer service has deteriorated.<br />I think that only Texans would be interested in the parts about oil and gas companies.	2002-03-11

I'd never heard of her, but found the book in my library yesterday.  I'm glad that I had not bought it.<br />I live in Connecticut, but am not a native like the author.  I am not upset at her snide comments about Texas.  That is the way people in Connecticut are.  They are very snobby and superior.  They do not believe there is anything west of the Hudson that is worth knowing about and they make fun of anything out there.<br />As far as this book, I liked it except for the vulgar language here and there which I guess is necessary these days.  It lowers my opinion of the author, tho.  She doesn't really have to write that stuff.<br />Interesting story with a few twists.  However, Sue Grafton's Kinsey is more to my liking.  I don't think I'll read another book about Poppy.	2002-03-08

She is not overly sympathetic, but relates what happened.  Unfortunately she was one of the friends/helpers Diana had turned away from by the time of her death and Ms. Simmons describes why.  I think if the accident hadn't happened they'd have made up by now.<br />This book doesn't praise or bash a very sad and mixed-up young woman.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in Diana.	2002-03-03

I worked in a nursing home for several years and saw all sorts of strange things like she has described.  She has written perfectly about the atmosphere in such a place and the people who work there.  I wish we had learned if Leila actually stole the money out of the bank account and more about her, but she wasn't the main character.  I didn't particularly like either of Dr. P's wives.<br />Henry, her landlord, is one of my favorites.  I wish I had a neighbor like him!	2002-02-22

Well, at least one part of it.  The self-centeredness of Prince Charles is not surprising.  He expects every whim to be catered to without question and immediately.  He comes across as very spoiled and out of touch.<br />Princess Diana is another matter.  Her instability is so apparent.  It is too bad that she did not get professional help.<br />The last sentence, &quot;But where is it all going to end?&quot; is sad when you think about what happened to Diana.<br />The author doesn't take sides, but has given us a good look into the private lives of a very unhappy family.	2002-02-21

These are strange people and it is only by accident of birth that they are where they are.  Some parts will make you laugh and others will make you cry.  The author doesn't give us much hope that history won't repeat itself.  It may all be over upon the passing of Queen Elizabeth II.  I am re-reading this book after a few years.  What an interesting book it is.  A lot of detail that I had forgotten.  It ends in 1993, but that is fine.  I wonder what the author thinks of what has happened since?	2002-02-05

The author's insights and observations are right on target.  It was published in 1993 before the tragic death of Princess Diana, but that does not change his thoughts on the problems of the monarchy.  Nothing will change until the death of Queen Elizabeth II as she is too bound up in tradition to modernize.  The whole family lives in a time warp.<br />I recommend this book highly to anyone who is interested in the history of the House of Windsor and how it is crumbling.	2002-02-03

What a great book to be snowed in with.<br />In addition to being a good love story involving several couples, it is a great book on life as it was before and during WW II in Great Britain.  The hardships the people endured are told in great, and sometimes amusing, detail.  No matter how bad things become people just carry on.  A good cup of tea seems the answer to everything!

Telling us the condition now of places mentioned and objects once owned by Marie Antoinette and where we might see them are a welcome addition to a biography.<br />I've been lucky enough to visit Versailles twice.  Once spent a day there touring all of the sites on the grounds including the Petit Trianon and the little farm.  Also saw her cell at the Conciergerie which remains still a dreadful place as the author has described it.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history and having a fresh look at a sad story.

I thought it was right that Natalie insisted on full make-up and nice clothes when going anywhere to keep up her image. I have seen most of her movies and don't have a favorite. It is odd to think, though, of the number of times she had to be in or near water and how frightened she was of it. You would never know from watching her. For that reason, I wonder why she spent so much time on boats. Her last hours put her in great danger, but she seemed unable to stop the spin. It reminded me in a way of Princess Diana's last day where she did threw caution to the wind. The questions concerning her death are disturbing and I don't suppose the truth will ever come out. I recommend this book to anyone who remembers her and for those who would like to know about a real star.	2001-08-28

After all, both author and Charles are still alive.  Diana can't fight back.  And who knows what the truth is anyway? <br />There isn't anything really new in this book except details about how news of Diana's death was received at Balmoral, actions of Charles and the Queen then, etc.  There are conflicts with other accounts I've read.  Was Diana's face damaged?  Was an autopsy done in Paris?  Other sources said her face was unmarked and body was not autopsied until it was returned to London.  It is little details like this that make me wonder about rest of the book. What is the truth?<br />I continue to be amazed at the influence the press has in England.  Do they really have that much control over the Royal Family?  Apparently they just make stuff up and everyone believes it. The Royals are so out of touch and isolated.  I think they should just be left alone and out of the newspapers like they used to be.	2001-06-17

Have just re-read it and find that it is mostly gossip.  The author's annoying way of identifying her sources puts me off.  Few are named by their real names.  It's like reading a tabloid.<br />Diana comes across as a spoiled brat, but Charles leaves a lot to be desired also.  At this point, do we really care?  The Royal Family and their &quot;toadies&quot; in the UK seem so outdated.  Their lives are very superficial and pointless according to this book.	2001-06-14

The Adams apple appeared after she was given male hormones.  She ran away from those doctors and discontinued medication.  Surgery corrected her problem which her parents didn't know how to handle when she was born.   <br />Reviews should only be about books and writing style.  Not personal problems.

Other reviewers have written that they thought there were too many unconnected stories.  I think it just shows you what a mix of people there are in this small town in England.  Crime touched all neigborhoods it seems.   <br />The explanation for two of the disappearing girls was touching.

Liked the first story best.  You just knew he would come to a bad end with his obsession for perfection.  I couldn't feel sorry for him.  He drove himself over the edge.<br />Another reviewer mentioned she wondered if the author was getting back at readers who send her criticisms?

James books available, I've been reading the books by her friend, Ruth Rendell. This is the first one I picked up. I enjoyed the characters, who are a strange bunch and not very likeable really, and what happened to them. The deaths that occur are not your usual murders with police investigation. In fact only one is brought to the attention of the police. The others are just disappearances of the persons, which no one follows up on, and one apparently from natural causes. I loved the ending. It would make a good Hitchcock movie.  I have just ordered a used copy of this book because my library no longer has it.  My sister is reading it on my recommendation and really likes it.  I've hinted that the ending is a surprise and am so afraid I will let something slip.  I can hardly wait to read it again.	2001-05-16

It is a great read.  I liked the way the characters didn't reveal everything at first questioning.  They didn't volunteer information, but made the police investigators work.  I think some of us don't understand this as we tend to talk too much.<br />I was upset by reviewers, especially Publishers Weekly, who revealed additional murders.  That spoiled it for me.  I think  reviews should be edited so none of the plot is given away for books like this.<br />I believe the reference to leeks as mentioned in previous reviews was only important as far as they were wrapped in newspaper which  made one of the characters remember something.  I won't give anything away.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.	2001-05-04

As a pilot's ex-wife a lot of things were familiar, but a lot was odd.<br />Most pilots' families travel as often as they can on passes.  Kathryn didn't seem to.  She seemed detached from Jack's life.<br />I wasn't surprised at the double life he was leading (personal experience).  He was sending out all sorts of signals.<br />I agree with a reviewer, Maureen Earl, that the second marriage probably came out during the trial in England.  Wouldn't that be in the news?  And, yes, I wondered if a page or something was missing from the abrupt ending.<br />I skimmed through the reviews and think it is interesting to notice that readers either hated or loved this book.  There wasn't much in between!<br />I read the author's book &quot;Resistance&quot; which I enjoyed much more than &quot;The Pilot's Wife&quot;.	2001-04-01

I've read so much about the Kennedys that I almost skipped it.  Am glad I didn't.   Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.<br />There are a few new things and more details about other events.  I particularly liked the parts about Joan.  She's always been my favorite of them all.  That Ted was so cruel to her is unforgivable.  The Kennedy men come across as poor husband material!<br />It was interesting to be reminded of these times again. I would recommend this book to anyone.  These are three strong women.	2001-03-22

I had no idea until I read this book of what a full and interesting life she was living.  She had much pain and sorrow in her life, but she carried on.<br />I like her down to earth writing.  She has written about ordinary things and left some things unsaid which is fine.  She came from a very reserved background so it's to be expected.  Her childhood was during a very different time than today.  That she did so much for others is evidence of that upbringing.    <br />After reading this book, I visited Hyde Park.  I went first to her house at Val-Kill before I went to the Big House and Library. I recommend a visit to everyone because I believe you get a real feel for her there.  At Val-Kill it's like she has just stepped out for a moment, but will be back.<br />I recommend this book to everyone.  Editors give background information before each selection for those who weren't alive during the time.  Eleanor did not go into great detail in her columns as, of course, her readers at the time would know what she was talking about.	2001-03-16

There isn't much in it that I had not read elsewhere except there is too much about JFK and his  skirt chasing.  After awhile it gets boring to read about all of escapades.  I've lost a lot of respect for him.<br />I was surprised to read that Jackie did not actually spend much time at the White House, but was always traveling.  There is a lot we did not know at the time.  It is hard now to know who to believe.	2001-02-23

It sounded interesting to me and so I ordered it.<br />Since it was written in 1898, it tells of a life very different than any today.  As an Englishwoman, it was difficult for her to live in the stuffy German society in the city.  Having a garden and house in the country where she did quite what she wanted kept her sane.  Of course, having a houseful of servants helped.<br />She has a wonderful sense of humor while describing all the little things that she cannot do as the lady of the house.  It must have been a very difficult situation.<br />I loved the term she gave her husband, &quot;The Man of Wrath&quot;.  I'm going to look for more books by this author.	2001-02-11

Was interested in what Sarah Bradford would write as have her biography of George VI that I enjoyed.<br />The writing is fine, except for the lack of editing as mentioned by others.  The subject bothers me.  I knew that Jackie was a shopaholic and sold her clothes to a resale shop, but reading about it again really turned me against her.  What a greedy, insecure person she was.  I don't think that she was ever really  happy even with her money and several homes.  I used to envy her when she was in the White House, but now that I know the rest of the story, I don't.	2001-01-03

Harold Ross had such a way with words.  I particularly liked the letter of sympathy to E.B. White (page 97) upon death of White's father:  &quot;...after you get to be thirty people you know keep dropping off all the time and it's a hell of a note.&quot;  And about Christmas:  &quot;...it always comes at the very worse moment in the year for me.&quot;<br />Here is truly a genius at work.  I thought it was ironic also that although he said don't waste time writing letters as you don't get paid for them, he wrote them so well.  It is also interesting that the editor of this book finally found some recordings that Ross made and he was dictating letters!<br />I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys The New Yorker and  would like to know how it developed over the years.	2000-12-28

My sister and I were talking about this book yesterday and I checked to see if it was still available.  Thank goodness it is!<br />I first read it in 1987 and laughed out loud at parts.  It is all so true.  If you grew up in the Midwest with Swedish-American parents like we did, it is all familiar.  Particularly funny are the photographs and captions.<br />Sections on the Lutheran Church are just the way it was for us. Jello was the food of choice at every church occasion that required food and from what I've heard still is.<br />I think it helps if you have a Scandinavian background so you can understand the jokes which are so funny to us, but may not be to outsiders.<br />I still get a laugh each time I look at it.	2000-12-26

Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter, but read it first.  In fact, I read it as soon as I got it home from the bookstore!<br />Found it a very attractive book.  The story of the restaurant is interesting and photographs of completed dishes were well done.  Having the real employees in the pictures makes it fun.  Also identifying and picturing local suppliers shows some of the real people on the island.  Recipes aren't that complicated.<br />I've spent limited time at Martha's Vineyard as don't really like it there.  Last summer the line at The Black Dog was too long so we went elsewhere.  Maybe next time I'll try to get inside.  In the meantime, have recipes to try!	2000-12-22

Was this the author's choice or did someone at the publisher's make the final decision?<br />The moment I heard the announcement over the radio that Saturday morning that his plane was missing, I knew his was gone.  And as  the day went on and more details were made known I wasn't surprised that the plane had crashed.  Andersen's chapters about the events leading up to the flight and the search had a few things I hadn't read before, but it was heartbreaking to read them again.<br />I've read a lot of books about the Kennedys, the last being the cookbook by Marta Sgubin, but this one gives more information about John's and Caroline's formative years than I've seen before.  Mostly had seen photos of them attending graduations, weddings, and was nice to read the rest of the story.<br />I think that John did a fine job of being normal.  Just think of his life - handsome and rich enough to do anything he wanted. That he wasn't a playboy like so many rich people can be is a miracle.<br />There are private things we do not need to know or shouldn't know and I think the author has gone far enough.  I wasn't disappointed that there was so little about Carolyn Bessette.  She didn't seem very interesting to me.<br />I think those of us who were here at the time of Camelot will always be interested in the family.  This book has just enough gossip to make it worth reading.	2000-12-05

I was very disappointed.  The author is trying too hard to be clever and funny and he isn't.<br />I didn't find it very amusing as I'm surrounded by these vapid creatures. In the past few years the area where I live has become &quot;in&quot; and they have arrived in their SUVs and with bad manners to clutter up our quiet spot with their McMansions.  They are shallow and boring, but a source of amusement to watch playing country.

I bought this book on Saturday afternoon and have been reading it almost non-stop.  Just glanced at the Sunday papers.  <br />In the Forward the author writes that biographies are difficult as different people tell what happened at one particular time or event in different ways.  It is hard to know what is the truth, but in this case he was able to interview people who are still alive and could provide insight.<br />I had never known much about Maria Callas before I read this, but have so enjoyed reading her story.  She was larger than life and things that happened to her reflect that.  <br />After reading about all of the affairs, power plays, wasted lives, etc, of these supposedly &quot;beautiful people&quot;, I am glad that my life has been boring.  <br />I grew to dislike Onassis as the book went on.  He wasn't a very nice person.  Don't feel one bit sorry for him for all the trouble he had in his last years. <br />Many pictures, that I'd never seen before, added to book.  I'm so glad the author wrote this.	2000-10-30

No one says you have to read every word!<br />This book is another example of the mystery books that the English seem to write so well.  What is it about them that make their mysteries so interesting?  Is it that they seem more civilized?

That's how I feel about this book.    <br />The story is too predictable and I found myself skimming through the last chapters after reading the first few to find out who the characters were.<br />Maybe I will go back for another reading later, but I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed with this latest book of Mrs. Pilcher's.	2000-10-11

I had read excerpts in The Sunday Times so knew what to expect.  Have read most of the recent books about the Royals and there isn't too much new here except for more details on several events.<br />This is a wonderful, balanced account that tells of the daily workings of the Royal Family---at least one part of it.  There is nothing to be shocked about except at the spoiled, self-centered bunch they are.  It is amazing to think that they carry on as if their lives are normal!  An accident of birth has placed these people in a terrible position.  I don't envy them for a minute.<br />Poor Diana.  How did she ever get mixed up with this bunch?	2000-10-11

Echo has a great way of expressing herself.  Love the comment about her fiance who gave her &quot;that sort of blank Lutheran stare he gets whenever I mention spotting a ghost.&quot;  Having a teacher whose name is Mrs. Olson struck me as funny.  You don't usually think of psychics and ghost hunters in Minnesota!<br />I had never heard that ghosts are low energy and that is why we can't always see them, but that makes sense.  <br />Am going to read her other books as soon as I can.  Really enjoy her light-hearted style.  No doom and gloom here.	2000-10-08

Loved it and could barely put it down.  Interesting setting and good plot.  Just enough detail about the medical profession in England.  Watched for clues along the way, but was surprised by ending.  I had picked someone else for the murderer altho I decided early on that the two murders were done by same person.  This book has me hooked on Ms. James. Am planning to read the rest of her books as soon as I can.	2000-10-01

Was so surprised to see that no one had reviewed it before!<br />Whitaker had observed Charles and Diana for years and he comes to insightful conclusions about the self-centeredness of Charles such as &quot;... it never occurred to him that maybe his life should alter when he married.&quot; and &quot;For the first time in his life he was upstaged and...he did not like what was happening.&quot;  Diana didn't stand a chance against the men in grey or the ever present Camilla.<br />This was published in 1993 before the sad ending to Diana's life. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants the view of a working journalist.  Coverage of the Royal family was excessive during  the Diana years, and I'll admit I read almost everything about her, but I believe this a very balanced view of the sad situation that the Royal family is in.  They are outdated and unnecessary.	2000-09-23

Although I love mysteries and usually  check back pages to see who did it so that I can look for the clues the  writer gives, I did not with this book.  I was drawn in by all of  characters and liked the way she gave motives for most of them.  Any one of  a number of people could have done it.<br />I had not guessed who the murderer  was and was disappointed by the confession in a long, long letter.  The  ending was a let down also.  Felt it left things hanging.<br />I do enjoy her  writing and insights on why people act as they do, but something was  missing here.  I intend to read more of her books before I form a definite  opinion.	2000-09-17

I found this book in my library yesterday and have read it almost  non-stop.<br />It is truly delightful.  I like the understated way she  weaves her life story.  What impressed me most is her down to earth way of  saying that she realized that she would have to support her family since  her husband was unable to.  She just did it without whining or expecting  anyone to help her.  Her ideas and opinions on the health care system are  right on target.<br />Her references to other works, both hers and other  authors, will keep me busy for a long time.  I want to check out all of  them.<br />What I envy most is her mention of going here and there to  conferences and book signings, etc on the great train system in England.  I  have spent some time there and know how convenient it is.  Wish we had such  a rail system in the U.S.<br />Her thoughts on the writing experience are also  informative.  Am so glad she has written this book.	2000-09-06

Her parents divorced, her first husband cheated on her, her  second husband did also.  Who cares about who she supposedly had affairs  with? <br />She never had enough money to make up for not having enough love.  So this is somehow unique?  Somehow I can't feel sorry for her.  <br />The  rest of us manage to muddle along with what life throws our way.  We don't  make such a production of it.	2000-08-11

When you read about all of her comings and goings you wonder if she had any idea of how it would turn out?  Did she know it would soon end?<br />One  of my favorite books about her.

I began reading it immediately and found it so interesting.  <br />You must read the text between the recipes to get the full impact.  What  a story.  One can't imagine the life and times of these people, but Marta  gives you a good idea.    <br />The recipes aren't that difficult and I'll be  trying some soon.  They are very healthy sounding.<br />What is sad is to see  all of the family pictures and to realize that so many of them are  gone.<br />They had a magical life with &quot;Madam&quot;.  Grand Jackie fits  her best.	2000-05-24

I have read all of her books and recommend that readers do the same to see how Kinsey develops from A to O.<br />I have written to her and am on her mailing list for personal  appearances and advance notices of new books.  Sue is a great example of  how to treat her readers.  She respects us!<br />What I love about her books  is that there are a few sentences to tell you about Kinsey in each book.   Even though you may have missed the other books, it doesn't take you long  to learn about her. I love the idea that she has one black dress, has a  neat apartment, nice landlord, etc. <br />Her awful junk food choices washed  down by a glass of Chardonnay are wonderful!  She's the perfect person with  one dress and a VW.<br />I hope that Sue does not bring her up to date with  cell phones, etc too soon.  I've learned some great investigative tips from  her.  It's amazing what people will tell you over the phone when you play  dumb or are less than truthful.  No real crime here.  Just a fact-finding  mission.<br />O for Outlaw was a good read.  I didn't pick up who was the bad  guy until late in story.  Great ending as always.  The little bits of info  she  puts in lead to a surprise ending.  You think, &quot;How did I miss  that clue?&quot;<br />How can one say seriously, I'm awaiting &quot;P&quot;?   What will that stand for?	2000-05-05

I found it a thoughtful handling of an interesting subject.  It's very inspiring and, since I believe in guardian angels,  a good read. <br />I feel  my guardian angel was with me on the way home from my trip.  I left the  book on top of my suitcase by a chair in a bus station and went over to the  snack bar a few feet away.  Suddenly something made me look back.  A  suspicious looking young man with a jacket over his arm (on a hot July  afternoon) was seated by my suitcase.  I quickly went back to pick up the  book and suitcase before he ran off with it.  I feel my guardian angel told  me to look back at that moment.  Have written to the author about that  experience.	2000-04-09

Three years ago, I added this book to my too-large collection of books about the Royal Family.  I started re-reading it this week when looking up something about her disinterest in clothes while reading the reports of her  visit to Australia.  Whoever is doing her hats now should be drawn and  quartered!<br />This is an enjoyable book and I can only feel a bit sorry for  the Queen.  For all of her worldly possessions, she leads a rather dreadful  life.   Smiling, looking interested, holding flowers, etc. must almost  drive her out of her mind!  She does a good job of it, though, and for that  I give her credit.  It's a good show. I've been watching it for over 40  years!	2000-03-31

A very moving story of the only survivor of the most famous car crash in recent times.  It tells what facts were distorted in the media and what really happened during the time leading up to the  accident.  Trevor and his family have great courage and deserve health and  happiness.  I wish him a continued speedy recovery.<br /><br />25 May, 2017 I am re-reading this book as the 20th anniversary of this accident is this year.  One thing that I liked about the book was Trevor's explanation of how bodyguards actually work.  The things they check out before an appearance.  Why they want backup people.  Mr. Fayed was a tough man to work for.  I wonder if he still is?	2000-03-19

It has taken me this long to find it in my library.<br />I was put off by her way of going back and forth between  present, past and future.  It spoiled the flow of the story.  The Harvard  experience sounds awful, but Ivy League people have that mind set. As a  Midwesterner I know, but don't let it bother me.  There are many more  important things than a degree from Harvard which I think she finally found  out.<br />The paranormal experiences were interesting and believable, but am  sure bothered some readers.<br />The last few pages (316-18) were the best.	2000-03-12
