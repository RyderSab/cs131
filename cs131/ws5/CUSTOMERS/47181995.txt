John Man tracks the development of alphabets from the ancient Middle East and their spread across the world.<br />Man's basic theory is that the alphabet is a revolutionary idea.  It is not, he says, necessarily a BETTER way to record information than syllabic/pictographic scripts, but it is certainly a different way, and one that requires a fair degree of abstraction.<br />He further posits that writing systems have a great deal of inertia once established, since literacy is associated with knowledge, power, and social status.  Those who have put effort into learning a complicated system of writing, such as Chinese ideograms or Egyptian hieroglyphics, resist the establishment of a new system.  Therefore, the alphabet is likely to have developed in fringe societies of the Middle East, those who did not want their writing to be beholden to either Egypt or the great powers of Mesopotamia, which used cuneiform writing.<br />Man also discusses the spread of the alphabet system, with much attention given to the development of the Latin alphabet by way of the Etruscans, Greeks, Phonecians, and probably the Hebrews.  He also talks a little about the theory of alphabets and their inability to ever completely and accurately represent a language, if only because pronunciation changes.  (The chapter on the Korean Hangul alphabet is particularly interesting, both in terms of alphabet design and the reluctance of the Koreans to adopt the new system over Chinese ideograms.)<br />Man is a little vague in places, and spends a fair amount of time spinning speculative fictions about the transmission of the alphabet through the Mediteranean.  However, he is fairly careful to stress that he is only speculating, and nobody has solid evidence for much of the history of our alphabet.<br />In short, this is a fascinating book, and a wonderful introduction to the study of writing systems and the history of literacy.  While not as in depth as I might have prefered, it does cover a vast range of time and space, and offers interesting directions for further reading.y speculating, and nobody has solid evidence for much of the history of our alphabet.<br />In short, this is a fascinating book, and a wonderful introduction to the study of writing systems and the history of literacy.

US	47181995	R7SC9DISGKCT4	0876636946	567307376	Star Tales	Books	4	11	11	N	N	very good for what it is	Ian Ridpath's &quot;Star Tales&quot; is exactly what its title says: a collection of the myths and legends (mostly Greek) attached to the 88 recognized constellations.  The constellations are listed in alphabetical order, each with its accompanying history and legends and often with an illustration from old star charts -- ones that drew pictures over the collections of stars instead of linking the stars with straight lines.  The use of archaic star charts makes it difficult to properly identify any individual stars Ridpath mentions, since they are only marked as alpha, beta, epsilon, etc. in those pictures -- and the writing is very small!  It is also hard to transfer those free-form pictures to the more popular connect-the-dots view of constellations.<br />However, Ridpath never claims to be writing about how to find constellations or identify interesting stars.  He promises to tell stories, and he does.  Exhaustively.  With all alternate versions, plus references to the ancient Sumerian myths from which many Greek constellations sprang.  He also includes a discussion about the origins of star tales and a list of the more well-known obsolete constellations.<br />In short, &quot;Star Tales&quot; is a book with a deliberately limited subject matter that it treats intelligently and in great detail.  So long as you don't expect anything else from it, you'll be fine.  (Some of the stories are awfully fun in their own right, too!)	2003-01-29

It is quite limited in its scope -- containing only the northern constellations and no complete star maps -- but is very useful for basic constellation identification.  I used it mostly as a source of seasonal star maps for the boys to copy.  It also helpfully identifies some key stars in various constellations, and provides tips for finding various constellations once the positions of others are known.<br />However, this is about all the book is good for.  The explanations of various phenomena are extremely limited, VanCleave provides none of the legends behind the constellations, and her suggested questions and activities are often impractical or pointless.  (She also turned Saggitarius into some unholy thing she dubbed 'The Teapot.'  Sheesh.)  The book wavers between being a teacher's handbook and a student's textbook -- and fills neither purpose very well.<br />In other words, don't buy it.  Skim through it and take any useful activities and explanations, but don't be too disappointed if you come away with only a few ideas.	2003-01-29

Ignore the recommended age range on this book -- it's being discriminated against for being a comic and having some fairy-tale elements.  It ISN'T a children's book.  Not at all.<br />\\"Clockwork Angels\\" is one of Lea Hernandez's Texas Steampunk series of graphic novels.  As such, it is set in Texas (duh!) and describes a semi-Victorian society filled with magic and strange technology.  It's a loose sequel to a previous story, \\"Cathedral Child,\\" but it's not necessary to read the previous book to understand this one.  (Trust me.  I still haven't read \\"Cathedral Child,\\" but after reading \\"Clockwork Angels\\" I intend to get my hands on it posthaste!)<br />Stripped of complications, the story has two basic parts.  A woman once saw a beast that walked like a man and made seven magical daughters to defeat it.  One daughter was tricked into working for the beast to protect her sisters, and another -- the youngest, who has a weak heart -- has forgotten who she is.  In the other half of the story, Temperance Bane, a young woman who can read the dead, is asked to read the head of a man named Parrish, who was murdered over a hundred miles south of where his head appeared -- yet his head was discovered at nearly the same time as his body.  There are unexpected consequences to this reading.<br />Eventually Temper and her companion Amy flee south to Parrish's home town, where the two halves of the story come together.  Along the way we encounter mysterious cloaked women, fights on moving trains, mythical animals, long-lost relatives, a touching love story (between two women; if that disturbs you, perhaps you should avoid the book), kidnappings, and a cleverly discovered secret.<br />I have only two quibbles with the book.  First, the scene leading up to the discovery of Sacerdote's secret is a bit unclear, particularly with regard to Temper's internal dialogue.  Second, though Hernandez's black and white art is lovely -- sort of a mixture of shoujo manga and Art Noveau -- it can be a bit hard to tell various characters apart at first.  But these are minor difficulties.  Overall, \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is a wonderful story and definitely worth your time.e a bit hard to tell various characters apart at first.

I slow down, reading individual words instead of compressing them into sentences and paragraphs; McKillip's language is half the pleasure of her books.<br />The other thing I love about McKillip is how little her books resemble cookie-cutter \\"fantasy\\" dreck.  While her books are all reminiscent of each other, they are all individual.  And they are not like anything else I've read.  \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" is no exception.<br />Ombria is an ancient city; its past lies buried underground, layers of buildings and previous incarnations of the city shrouded in darkness.  Aboveground, the city is troubled.  The prince has died, leaving his five-year-old son Kyel Greve under the control of Domina Pearl, a woman who is steadily running Ombria into the ground for her own purposes.  She is opposed by the prince's mistress, Lydea; his bastard nephew, the artist Ducon Greve; Mag, the \\"waxling\\" servant of a mysterious sorceress who lives in the underground city; and various coalitions of nobles who know nothing of the magical forces also working in Ombria.<br />Magic and legends of a shadow city weave in and out of the political story.  I am still not sure how everything connects, particularly since none of the characters completely understands what happens towards the end.  I am not terribly convinced by the explanations given to Ducon and Mag, and the last chapter left me thoroughly confused.  However, while the story leaves a lot to be desired on the everyday level, the end *feels* right.<br />I just wish it made sense, too.	2002-03-29

Aramanth is a joyless city, divided into color-coded districts, with White being the best and Gray the worst.  Families are ranked based on the results of yearly examinations, and everyone is told to strive harder, reach higher, and better themselves.<br />Kestrel gets fed up and publicly insults the High Examiners, the Emperor, and the whole way of life in Aramanth.  This puts her whole family in danger, and she, Bowman and Mumpo (a hapless boy in their class at school) go on a quest to find the voice of the Wind Singer, a strange contraption at the heart of Aramanth, which has been silent for hundreds of years.  Meanwhile, their parents are fighting for their dignity and freedom in Aramanth.<br />The book is a wonderful fantasy, very inventive.  In addition to the thoroughly unpleasant culture of Aramanth, we meet the mud people who live under the city, the Baraka and Chaka who travel the desert plains in great wheeled ships, the disturbing \\"old children,\\" and the unstoppable Zars, who serve as the army of the Morah, an evil being who holds the voice of the Wind Singer.  Unfortunately, the later stages of the quest, once Kestrel, Bowman and Mumpo leave the plains, are not nearly as detailed and absorbing as the first two thirds of the book.<br />\\"The Wind Singer\\" is a lovely, fun book, which manages to deliver a message without beating readers over the head.  Though it's the first book of a trilogy, it stands very well on its own, leaving only a few dangling hints unresolved.  However, it's aimed at people between 8 and 12 years old; adults and teens should adjust their expectations accordingly.	2002-02-21

I was an idiot; I admit it.  Finally, in early October, I gave in and bought &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes.&quot;  Two days later, I bought two more &quot;Sandman&quot; volumes, and, over the next three weeks, all the others.  I would still be buying the rest of Gaiman's work, but I have no more money.<br />&quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; introduces Dream, called Morpheus, who is both lord over and incarnation of dreams and stories.  This first volume contains eight issues or chapters; the first seven describe a quest and the eighth is an epilogue of sorts.  Dream is imprisoned at the beginning of the 20th century; he escapes in 1988 and must retrieve three powerful tools that were stolen from him.  The overall tone is quite dark and more influenced by horror than much of the later series.<br />&quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; is undoubtedly the &quot;Sandman&quot; volume that fits least well with the others, but I wouldn't call it weak.  Gaiman's stories have a peculiar ability to take up space in my imagination; they have an almost physical presence and demand to be reread.<br />It is not surprising that this book is not the most accurate representation of the series.  After all, &quot;Sandman&quot; was written as serial fiction.  It's hard to find the heart of a story until part of it has been written, often with a lot of floundering for tone and style; in serial fiction, the writer has no chance to erase or edit that experimentation.<br />Think of &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; as Gaiman groping for the heart of his story.  He finds it near the end of the book, particularly in the epilogue, which has nothing to do with quests and battles but much to do with life.  However, the uncertain beginning chapters are well-written and powerful in their own right, and their events, though perhaps not their tone, are an integral part of the later series.r events, though perhaps not their tone, are an integral part of the later series.	2001-11-18

So, what's your favorite book?&quot;  But if I had to answer, I think I would choose &quot;Very Far Away from Anywhere Else.&quot;  I found this book when I was a sophomore in high school, and I could not believe how well I understood Owen and Natalie, and how similar their lives were to mine.  I still can't believe Le Guin fit so much into such a short book -- my paperback edition has only 87 pages.<br />The story unfolds like life, following the course of Owen and Natalie's friendship, in their senior year of high school.  Owen narrates, at the end of the year, trying to figure out exactly what the year, and Natalie's friendship, meant to him.<br />But the story itself is not that important.  Owen and Natalie themselves are the heart of the book, and are two of the most human characters I have ever encountered.  Owen has never fit in with people, wants to be a scientist, and has trouble telling anyone what he really wants from life.  Half of his trouble may be that he isn't quite sure what he wants.  Natalie is a musician, who performs and teaches, but she is really a composer.  Unlike Owen, she knows what she wants from life, and is following a careful plan to reach her goals.  Of course, neither is really that simple; no real person can be summed up in two sentences, and neither can Owen and Natalie.<br />&quot;Very Far Away from Anywhere Else&quot; is a book which is easier to read than to explain, and any summary will lose the parts of the book that make it really worthwhile.  If I could sum up the book for you, I doubt I would love it enough to reread it at least once a year.  Let me close, then, by telling you how much I love this book.  I own hundreds of books, and love at least half of them.  Of all those books, this is the only one I brought to college this year.  This is the one I take on all my trips.  This is the one I read whenever I start to feel my life is pointless.  This is the one that is dangerously close to falling apart, just because I read it so much.<br />Buy this.  Read it.

I found two of the three main characters somewhat boring and annoying, the story too slow until the crisis point, and the ending a bit abrupt.<br />&quot;In the Company of Others&quot; has an extensive backstory, which is revealed in varying degrees of grace. It goes like this: in the future, humans have invented space travel (it's FTL, as is the communications tech, but is never discussed; this is a character, sociology, and xenobiology story) and have terraformed many barren worlds. However, these world were contaminated by the Quill, a formerly harmless alien species that has now become deadly; people on terraformed worlds die instantly, for no discernable reason. Tens of thousands of immigrants (immies) and many spacers ('siders) are trapped on space stations originally intended to house only a few thousand people. Earth has imposed a near-total quarantine on the stations, and has stopped space exploration and terraforming.<br />A generation after the Quill incursion, Dr. Gail Smith has a theory that the Quil on the terraformed worlds are genetically linked to the chief terraforming engineers for each world. She wants to test her theory on Pardell, a world whose coordinates were known only to Susan Witts, the chief of all the terraforming engineers, and the one who gave Quill as presents to the other terraformers. Gail comes to Thromberg Station, searching for Aaron Pardell, Witts's great-grandson, and his ship, the Merry Mate, which holds the only known record of Pardell's location. Pardell is more than just an anonymous 'sider, however; he was born on Pardell, and is the only person to survive an encounter with the Quill. He, however, doesn't know this.<br />The story follows Aaron, Gail, and Hugh Malley, Aaron's best friend, as they travel from Thromberg to Pardell, learning about each other and the Quill. The plot is fairly intricate; I won't attempt to describe it, because the Quill are supposed to be a mystery. (That said, I do think it's odd that nobody, Rosalind in particular, ever realized the source of Aaron's odd medical condition.) The chief supporting characters are interesting and well-drawn, and the Quill are satisfactorily alien aliens. However, I found Gail and Malley somehow flat, and often skimmed their sections, wanting to get back to Aaron. (To be fair, Gail does improve in the second half of the book.) There is a nicely understated love story, and a lovely conclusion. However, for some incomprehensible reason, Czerneda added a brief epilogue that completely threw me out of her world. It was completely unnecessary, and very grating.<br />&quot;In the Company of Others&quot; is a bit thick and intricate for light summer reading, but not especially deep or difficult.

P>Modesitt continues to fill in the history of Candar and Recluce, this time reaching back before \\"Fall of Angels\\" to show how the ancient empire of Cyador wasn't always a horrible place, even though it was based on chaos.<br />\\"Scion of Cyador\\" continues the story of Lorn and Ryalth, the couple introduced in \\"Magi'i of Cyador.\\" Lorn, an officer in Cyador's army, has mysterious plans and some magical abilities, as well as many mysterious enemies. Ryalth, his wife, is the founder of Ryalor House, a successful trading house; Modesitt is obviously not afraid of women. In this book, Lorn returns to Ryalth in Cyad, the capitol of Cyador, and faces deadly intrigues as the Emperor lies dying, without an heir. To understand \\"Scion of Cyador,\\" you almost have to read \\"Magi'i of Cyador;\\" this is less a sequel than a continuation of an unfinished story. Familiarity with the other Recluce books is not necessary, but it is helpful.<br />However, familiarity with the other books makes perfectly clear how thin and tired the series has become. As I started \\"Scion of Cyador,\\" I was afraid I knew exactly where the story was going, and I was right. There were a few brief moments where I thought Modesitt might actually break out of his foreordained plot, and send Lorn and Ryalth off to found Lornth, the nation that figures prominently in \\"Fall of Angels\\" and \\"The Chaos Balance,\\" but if that ever happens, it'll take yet another sequel.<br />Modesitt has hit a formula for the Recluce Saga, and his formula is choking the life from his stories. I still like his protagonists, though they are all variations on one character (a young man learning that the world forces good people to make hard choices, who agonizes over his actions and inactions), but I find I no longer care enough to overlook the deadening plots. I stopped buying Recluce books after \\"Fall of Angels,\\" and I have yet to see any reason not to simply borrow them from libraries. If Modesitt continues the series, but doesn't improve, I will stop reading them altogether.<br />Also, Modesitt's poetry is distinctively mediocre, which is awkward, because he links Lorn's realizations about the way of the world to Lorn's interpretation of poems \\"written\\" by one of the founders of Cyador. I dislike mediocre poetry, and Modesitt's tendency to treat it as deep and meaningful irritates me.e, I will stop reading them altogether.<br />Also, Modesitt's poetry is distinctively mediocre, which is awkward, because he links Lorn's realizations about the way of the world to Lorn's interpretation of poems \\"written\\" by one of the founders of Cyador.

Stover is amazingly good at using the conventions of action, fantasy, and dystopian science fiction while also subtly twisting them in service of his all too believable and recognizable characters.  Unlike many authors, he understands that actions have consequences, not all conflicts have good solutions, and nobody can be a hero all the time.  He writes great fight scenes, too.<br />&quot;Blade of Tyshalle&quot; is, in some ways, very similar to &quot;Heroes Die.&quot;  It focuses on Hari Michaelson, and his alter-ego, Caine, as he fights against impossible odds to save his family from threats on both Earth and Overworld.  It includes action, dungeons, desperate last stands, and so on.  However, this book spends a lot more time on other characters, including Shanna/Pallas Ril, Hari's wife; Ma'elKoth, who goes by Tan'elKoth for much of the book; Raithe, a young Monastic dedicated to killing Caine; Kollberg, Hari's old nemesis, raised up from his exile to the Labor Pool; and Kris/Deliann, the Changeling Prince of the elves.  Also, Earth has become more directly involved with Overworld, to the point of creating an enclave of technology, and later releasing an incurable virus to justify an armed invasion, in the name of &quot;restoring order;&quot; this changes the rules of the game.<br />The plot is even more intricate than in &quot;Heroes Die,&quot; but the story also contains much more social commentary and philosophy.  There are many brief, odd, semi-mythic interchapters, which, once you figure out which character corresponds to which mythic figure, provide a handy road map for the rest of the book.<br />After I finished &quot;Blade of Tyshalle,&quot; I wasn't quite sure what I thought of it.  I let it sink in for a few days, then reread the book.  I knew I liked the action and the characters, and the way the loose ends from the first book, particularly the much-vaunted &quot;black flow&quot; were finally resolved, but I wasn't sure about the philosophy and social theory, or about the balance among the various elements of the book.<br />I think, finally, that &quot;Blade of Tyshalle&quot; is a very, very good book.  It is also, unquestionably, a flawed book, from which several plot and character complications -- and fifty to a hundred pages -- could profitably have been trimmed.  But it made me think, it involved me emotionally, it convinced me it was worth the money I paid for it, and it hooked me enough that I have already reread it three times.

Reading them in 2001 creates an interesting time-lapse effect, especially when he refers to the &quot;recent&quot; creation of Image, or the &quot;recently concluded&quot; Gulf War.  Some of the columns are a bit dated, while others are more or less timeless; even the dated ones are worth reading, for a glimpse at the comics industry in the early ninties.<br />David has a marvelous sense of humor, and an eye for stupidity and inconsistency.  His columns are entertaining, even when I have very little understanding of his subject matter.  (Hey, I was only nine years old when these were current!  What did I know back then?)  He also explains his subject matter, which is very helpful.  Looking back, it's interesting to observe which of his opinions and predictions were accurate and well-founded, and which weren't.<br />Basically, this is good entertainment, with information about comics writers, artists, publishers, and fans in the early 1990s.  It's also a good, though indirect, look at Peter David.  I would definitely be interested in a collection of his more recent columns.	2001-05-28

It's probably the most overtly weird book I've read this year -- outside of some novels for my German literature classes -- which is a sad comment on the current state of sf, fantasy, and comics.  What is speculative literature for, after all, if not to show us things we'd never imagine for ourselves, and draw us into different worlds?<br />This volume contains the first seven issues of &quot;Finder,&quot; a black and white comic book written and drawn by Carla Speed McNeil.  After seven issues, I'm still not quite clear about the overall story, but honestly, I don't care.  I'd be happy to read about the daily lives of people in this world for years, because they are just that: people.  As much as there is a main story, it seems to be this: Jaeger, the titular character, is involved with Emma, a woman who, with her three children, abandoned her abusive and controlling husband.  Jaeger is also involved with the husband, Brigham, and he's not quite sure how to deal with the situation, or even what the situation really is.<br />The story can sometimes be hard to follow, not because McNeil's art or layouts are unclear, but because she introduces bits and pieces of characters' lives without explaining how the people got into those situations, or whether the incidents are connected to the &quot;main&quot; story.  This adds a level of realism to the characters and the world, but it can be disconcerting.  Fortunately, footnotes at the back of the book explain some of those incidents, and some confusing bits of dialogue.  The dialogue, incidentally, is only confusing because it's realistic; people don't speak in expository paragraphs, so McNeil's characters don't either, which means characters don't explain their more obscure statements or references.<br />I have already read &quot;Finder: Sin-Eater&quot; several times, and each time I have loved it more.  If I weren't broke, I'd buy the second volume immediately.  Read this.  Trust me.  It's wonderful.rust me.  It's wonderful.	2001-05-28

Jesse and Tulip's relationship is developed well; Jesse can't stand the idea of Tulip in danger, especially after what happened in &quot;Until the End of the World,&quot; while Tulip can't stand being patronized.  I completely understood Tulip's point of view, of course, but I also sympathized with Jesse.  Congratulations to Ennis and Dillon for making those two into real people, in the middle of their hilariously gory chaos.<br />Eventually Jesse confronts Allfather D'Aronique, Starr, and the rest of the Grail, in his quest to rescue Cassidy.  He also learns more about Genesis, the being who gives him his power, and makes a deal with the Saint of Killers.  Meanwhile, God appears to Cassidy, with another message for Jesse, and further cements his impression as an asshole.<br />The last two issues alternate between modern New York and Cassidy's memories, as he tells Jesse how he became a vampire and came to America.<br />These books are gory, sick as hell, and often truly hilarious.  I love that aspect of this series.  They also have a thematic undercurrent of friendship, love, and responsibility.  I like that too.  A lot.	2001-05-02

About a month ago I went to my local comics shop and spent over thirty dollars on &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; and &quot;Proud Americans.&quot;  It was money well spent, though I don't think this series is for everyone.  In fact, people who can't accept an outsider's view of Christianity or a lot of gore and depravity should stay far away.<br />&quot;Until the End of the World,&quot; the second volume of Preacher, collects issues 8-17 of the series, continuing the story of Jesse Custer.  There are two story arcs in this volume.  First, Jesse and Tulip travel south to deal with the man who hired Tulip as a hitwoman, only to be kidnapped by Jesse's incredibly twisted family.  God finally makes an appearance; he's a bit of an...<br />In the second half of the book, Jesse and Tulip head to San Francisco to meet Cassidy, and become involved in a depraved party at the home of Jesus de Sade, a most *interesting* man.  The mysterious Grail, an organization mentioned in &quot;Gone to Texas,&quot; finally appears; Starr, a man high in the Grail, wants Jesse to play the messiah in Armageddon.  The Allfather of the Grail also wants Jesse captured, for reasons as yet unknown.  The book ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.<br />There are times when the violence and sexual depravity are tiresome, not funny, especially in the second story arc.  When the gore and depravity get gratuitous, they detract from Jesse, Tulip, and Cassidy, who are the heart of the story.  I would remove a star, but the rest of the book is so good it makes up for occasional lapses.	2001-05-02

Well, actually, according to Duncan, magic works in our world too, but we can't use it.  A person from our world can use magic in any other world, where he or she is a &quot;stranger,&quot; but no one can use magic in the world of his or her birth.  Magical power is called mana, and is especially powerful at places called nodes, which also serve as gateways to other worlds.  In our world, strangers work secretly, but in Nextdoor, they are gods.<br />&quot;Past Imperative&quot; is the story of Edward Exeter, a young man accused of murdering his friend in mysterious circumstances.  He is rescued from a hospital and sent to Nextdoor, where he is apparently known as the Liberator; prophecies in the unnervingly accurate Filoby Testament claim he will bring death to Death.  Edward wants no part of this; he wants to return to England and enlist as a soldier.  He spends much of the book avoiding various deities who would prefer not to deal with the Liberator and the chaos described in the Filoby Testament.<br />A significant portion of &quot;Past Imperative&quot; is told from the point of view of Eleal Singer, a young girl who finds Edward when he first appears in Nextdoor.  Those sections move slowly, especially near the beginning of the book.  Edward's sections are more interesting, though they are also slow at first.  The first two thirds of the book feel somewhat like a very extended first chapter, which sets up the main story.  It's good to have a world developed in great detail, but it does make for rather tedious reading.<br />At the end of the book, Edward has abandoned Eleal to avoid falling into the clutches of Tion, one of the Five great gods of Nextdoor, thus fulfilling parts of the Filoby Testament and the first third of an ominous prophecy given to him by a gypsy fortune-teller in England.

Actually, I never felt a need to read them, even to make sense of the third book.  That could mean either that each of the three books can stand alone, or it could mean that Martin almost completely dropped earlier plot threads.  Based on the book itself, which contained some hints and references to the two earlier books, I'm inclined to suspect the latter.<br />&quot;The House of Bairn&quot; opens with Bjorn, a mage-gifted hunter, accidentally unleashing a MageLord on his unsuspecting world.  This Lord, Soren, transported himself from the distant past, before the MageLords died in a world-devastating war, and he sends Bjorn back in time to balance his spell.<br />In the past, Bjorn, now called Bairn, becomes an apprentice to the MageLord Rylur.  He learns magic and math, while plotting the destruction of the MageLords, who rule the world with no consideration for the powerless.  Martin makes an interesting link between this world's magic and modern theories about subatomic particles, and the conversion of matter to energy; in this world, magical Power is produced by the destruction of matter, not a nuclear explosion.<br />Bairn eventually provokes a war between the male Northern Alliance and the female Southern Alliance.  After the war, he ends up as the most powerful man in the world, lives for thousands of years until the time he, as Bjorn, released Soren, and returns to set the world to rights.  He defeats Soren, and forcibly establishes peace between normal people and the magi, who have lived in hiding according to his laws.  He also miraculously saves his parents from death, and ends up with three loving wives.<br />This whole book is basically adolescent wish-fulfillment.  Bairn, alone of all people, is willing to study Power reservoirs, and so learns the secret of converting matter to Power; he doesn't tell anyone, and for some reason, Martin assumes no one would ever be able to duplicate Bairn's experiments.  Be serious, please.<br />Also, Bairn has so much Power that he can effectively take over the world, and for many intents, does so.  He provokes a world-devastating war, instead of trying to change the future.  He could save thousands in the years he spends on the moon, yet he only saves his parents.  He imposes sanctions against any normal people who harm the magi, and enforces them, yet doesn't do a thing to stop any other crimes.  We're supposed to treat this man as the hero?  This is supposed to be an emotionally satisfying conclusion to a story of hideous persecution?<br />&quot;The House of Bairn&quot; is selfish, childish trash.  No, I wrong trash.  This is tripe.  It is, however, reasonably well-written and entertaining tripe, though it left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.or some reason, Martin assumes no one would ever be able to duplicate Bairn's experiments.

Every time I try to read a series in order, I run into odd gaps in bookstores' shelf stocks, and I end up reading things all out of order.  For example, I planned to read &quot;Preacher&quot; in order, buying each volume from a local comics shop, but when I applied for a job at Borders, I happened to look at the graphic novel section.  And there they sat: &quot;Gone to Texas,&quot; &quot;Salvation,&quot; and &quot;All Hell's A-Coming.&quot;  Any sign of the volumes in between?  Noooo...  I have no willpower when it comes to books, so I bought &quot;Salvation&quot; and &quot;All Hell's A-Coming,&quot; and all my plans of actually following continuity went straight out the window.  Oh well.  This has never impaired my enjoyment of other series, and I guess it won't matter much now.<br />&quot;Salvation&quot; is the seventh collected trade paperback volume of &quot;Preacher, and is apparently a departure from much of the earlier storyline.  Following an epic confrontation in which Jesse loses his left eye, and Tulip goes off with Cassidy, Jesse is confused about his mission and his understanding of the world.  While trying to find his purpose, he spends some time as the sheriff of Salvation, a small town in western Texas.  Jesse soon angers Odin Quincannon, the crazed and crooked owner of a local meat plant, whose efforts to kill Jesse fill most of &quot;Salvation.&quot;  There are also subplots involving a former Nazi, a woman from Jesse's past, and Cindy, the deputy sheriff.  After Jesse leaves Salvation, he reaches the Pacific and takes peyote in an effort to remember what happened to his eye.  He remembers, and apparently makes a vital discovery about God's motives and fears.<br />The violence is a trifle more restrained, though Ennis and Dillon don't shy away from showing plenty of sexual perversions.  I personally think Quincannon's particular obsession might have been better left unrevealed; I imagined many things much more disturbing than what Ennis and Dillon finally show, which probably tells you more about me than you really need to know.  &quot;Salvation&quot; also contains numerous references to Westerns and the myth of America, which sound slightly out of place in the mouths of Americans, but I can easily forgive that lapse, since the story as a whole is so fun.<br />Yes, &quot;Salvation&quot; is quieter than &quot;Gone to Texas,&quot; but is that really a bad thing?  As my band director used to say, unchanging fortissimo gets old fast; you need to vary the volume and tempo to get the full effect of the exciting bits.  And soft is good in its own right, anyway.

It's also funny as hell, even though I still feel slightly disturbed that I actually laughed at some of the things that happen.<br />&quot;Preacher: Gone to Texas,&quot; is the first of the trade paperback collections of the comics series.  I haven't read any of the others, so I really have no idea what happens later, but after reading this first volume, I plan to buy the next ones in the very near future, and continue to not believe I'm laughing.  This stuff is addictive.<br />From what I can tell so far, &quot;Preacher&quot; is the story of preacher Jesse Custer, his ex-girlfriend Tulip, and Cassidy, an Irish vampire.  At some point, an angel and a demon had a child named Genesis.  Genesis was a new idea, as powerful as God Almighty; it has escaped its heavenly prison and bonded with Jesse.  Now Jesse, a moral person despite his many flaws, is searching for God.  He plans to ask some serious questions.<br />&quot;Gone to Texas&quot; falls roughly into two parts.  First there's the introduction, where we meet the three main characters, and others, such as the Saint of Killers.  Then the three hitchhike to New York City, where they start looking for God and get involved in a serial murder case.<br />There are times when the gore and cursing get too thick, so  they're tiresome instead of funny; that's why I'm not giving this five stars.  Still, &quot;Preacher&quot; is one of the best comics I've read in a while, and I'm looking forward to the next collected volumes.	2001-03-12

It is not fantasy.  If anything, it's social criticism or religious fiction, perhaps even subtle religious propaganda, though those aren't really accurate descriptions either.<br />In the 1890's, Jed Dey, the son of a wealthy supplier of exotic jewels and such, travels to Tibet with his father, in search of a rare type of gold.  His entire party is killed by bandits, and as he is dying in the snow, he has a mystical experience, somehow relating to a local mountain.  When he is rescued by a wandering man, he attempts to fit the experience into his life.<br />He later ends up in a Buddhist monastery, learning to read auras and use them to heal.  He also learns a Tibetan Buddhist way of looking at life, and does not want to leave.  This surprises his friend Will Detroit, a scion of upper-class America, who comes to rescue him by way of Paris and India.  Will is also transformed; however, he doesn't become a Buddhist monk, but resolves to go home and become a philanthropist.<br />&quot;Land of Precious Snow&quot; is a very odd book to read, particularly because it switches times as well as points of view, so some &quot;earlier&quot; chapters occur chronologically after &quot;later&quot; ones.  The writing is dense, and the first chapter, following Will's father and presenting large chunks of exposition, is hard to get through.  I found the book as a whole somewhat moving, through its sheer wealth and variety of imagery, though I have no particular idea what its point was, other than to expose Westerners to Tibetan mysticism, or comment on the miseries of life in poorer nations.  It's not very clear about the belief systems or ways of life, though, and it's not a terribly coherent narrative in its own right.<br />&quot;Land of Precious Snow&quot; is the kind of book that requires careful reading, and will probably strike some people as very deep and stirring.  It never quite captured me.me.	2001-03-12

People expecting explosive fights between Spidey and Venom will be very disappointed.  Unfortunately, the cover art and the back-cover blurb both focus on Venom, and wax enthusiastic about his violent tendencies and his role in the book, while DeCandido and Nieto present a police procedural that happens to involve superheroes.<br />Imagine, for a second, that you're a police officer in the Marvel Universe.  How would you feel about costumed superheroes?  Especially one whose face you never see, whose voice is muffled, and who almost never stands and walks like a normal human being.  One who interrupts crimes, leaving people webbed up with no evidence and no witnesses, then vanishes and lets you deal with the resulting mountains of paperwork.  DeCandido and Nieto have asked those questions, and written a book about them.<br />On Wednesday morning, three people are kidnapped: Joe Robertson, editor-in-chief of the Daily Bugle; Frank Esteban, a police captain; and Ann Weying, Venom's ex-wife.  There appears to be paranormal involvement, and Venom will almost certainly cause damage trying to find Ann.  The police and Spidey work together, trying to crack the case, which soon involves the FBI and a group of Puerto Rican separatists who have turned to terrorism.  It's nice to see that while Spidey has amazing luck with supervillains, he needs the help of the police for more realistic crimes; it's also refreshing to see Spidey from other points of view.  It's very easy for readers to forget that most people in the Marvel Universe know nothing about him, since we know about Peter Parker, his job troubles, his family, and so on.<br />To sum up, this is a good police story, and a good Spidey story.  It is NOT a Venom story.  If you read superhero comics for fights and explosions, this is not the book for you.  On the other hand, if you like some thought put into your superheroes, along with a healthy appreciation of how silly it is for people to run around town in long underwear, you could do a lot worse than &quot;Venom's Wrath.&quot;<br />(I'm taking away a star for four reasons.  First, there are a lot of police officers, and they can be hard to keep straight.  Second, Venom's characterization is slightly off.  Third, MJ isn't quite herself; she plays the policeman's faithful wife, though she does make a good point to Peter in the epilogue.  And fourth, the cover and blurb attract people who will probably be disappointed by a lack of action, and drive away people who might like this as a police story and meditation on identity.)ome thought put into your superheroes, along with a healthy appreciation of how silly it is for people to run around town in long underwear, you could do a lot worse than &quot;Venom's Wrath.&quot;<br />(I'm taking away a star for four reasons.

I had never read &quot;Teckla,&quot; and was a bit leery of it, after reading the reviews which all seem to call it depressing.  Well, it is depressing.  Very depressing, actually.  However, that doesn't necessarily make it bad.  In fact, I think it may be one of the better books in the series, in terms of human drama.  If you follow this series chronologically, Vlad becomes more complex and human with each book, and &quot;Teckla&quot; is an important step on his journey.<br />In &quot;Teckla,&quot; Vlad discovers that his wife, Cawti, has joined a revolutionary organization, composed of Easterners and Teckla, and based in South Adrilankha.  Vlad can't understand why Cawti cares about revolution and social justice; they argue throughout the book, and their marriage is under serious strain.<br />The plot is complicated, as usual, involving numerous assassination attempts, Jhereg internal wars, and the three-way clash of the revolutionaries, the Jhereg, and the Phoenix Guards.  However, it isn't nearly as fun as the chronologically &quot;earlier&quot; books; Brust poses serious questions about the social and political organization of the Dragaeran Empire, and the costs and true effects of revolution.  Along the way, he finally manages to make Vlad question the morality of his lifestyle.  Vlad, who had previously accepted organized crime and assassination now has to face Cawti's disapproval, and realize that maybe, when he looks very closely, he doesn't like himself that much.<br />This was the third Vlad book Brust wrote, but at the moment, it is chronologically fifth in the series.  However you count, this is NOT the place to start reading; without knowing Vlad's past, &quot;Teckla&quot; is a bit confusing.  It's also a lot darker than the earlier novels, and less fun, but it builds logically on everything we know about Vlad.  Brust, interestingly, makes Vlad a real, changing, growing person, not just an entertaining but utterly unrealistic assassin.not just an entertaining but utterly unrealistic assassin.	2001-03-07

This first book deals with astronomy and dynamics, and the union of those two disciplines that created our modern ideas of the universe, forces, motion, etc.<br />Toulmin and Goodfield begin in ancient Babylon, where highly accurate mathematical techniques were used to calculate the positions of heavenly bodies.  They move through several periods of Greek thought, through the medieval period and the flourishing of Islamic scholarship, on through the Renaissance, up to Newton, past Einstein, and on to the middle of the twentieth century.  They are careful to show how and why past astronomers and natural philosophers asked the questions they did, why things that today appear to be common sense were inconceivable in the past, and why obviously brilliant people explained the world in ways we now see as misguided.<br />&quot;The Fabric of the Heavens&quot; is an amazing book, especially because of Toulmin and Goodfield's ability to make complex ideas clear to those of us who aren't physicists or astronomers.  I was, however, somewhat dissatisfied near the end.  Toulmin and Goodfield, while skilled at explaining the distant past, seem a bit slapdash describing the first half of the twentieth century, and, of course, do not describe the second half at all.  The book also has a highly Western focus, probably because cosmological ideas in other parts of the world did not directly affect the development of modern science.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;The Fabric of the Heavens&quot; is fascinating, well-written, and enjoyable.  I highly recommend it.	2001-03-07

Having not read &quot;Operation Chaos,&quot; I can't say whether or not its sequel, &quot;Operation Luna,&quot; is similar.  It's not really necessary, however, to read &quot;Chaos&quot; before reading &quot;Luna,&quot; since Anderson apparently decided to redo all his expository work.  And my god, did he redo it!  It took me two days to get through the first 150 pages, and I can normally finish a 700 page book in an afternoon.  The book does get better after those first 150 pages, but I'm not sure it's worth plowing through that morass of banality.<br />&quot;Operation Luna&quot; is set in an alternate world, where magic was reawakened by an unexplained physics experiment in the early 20th century.  People ride broomsticks and flying carpets; traditional deities, fairies, ghosts, and other magical creatures exist; the IRS uses the tax code as dread incantations; etc.  The time period is not terribly clear; Steve says eleven years have passed since &quot;Chaos,&quot; which was apparently set during this world's WWII, but the tone seems very modern.<br />As the story opens, Steve Matuchek, an engineer and werewolf, and his wife Ginny, a beautiful witch (must the women always be beautiful?), are working with NASA to send people to the moon.  When NASA's program is sabotaged, they begin -- oh-so-slowly! -- to work on their own space program, and to discover who's behind the sabotage.  There are complications with the IRS, the FBI, Steve and Ginny's children, a Chinese spy, and demons of various nationalities, which eventually come together in a climactic battle, after which the book abruptly ends, without ever quite resolving its issues.  Also, the overarching theme of the story never becomes clear, though Anderson seems to think there is one.<br />Steve Matuchek is a lousy narrator; the book would have done much better in third person.  Steve has three main functions: to tell us he can't describe things well, thus excusing Anderson's lack of descriptive ability; to be confused by magic, thus allowing Anderson to avoid showing a clear system of spells; and to wonder what his world would be like without magic, thus allowing Anderson to show differences between this world and ours, in one of the clunkiest expository techniques it has ever been my misfortune to read.<br />I know Anderson can write, and I enjoy his other books.  But this one is too long for its own good, and the charm of some later scenes (particularly those with the enchanted sword Fotherwick-Botts and his/its smith, the dwarf Fjalar) is dampened by the tedium of the exposition and Steve's narration.  Also, Steve tends to reveal plot twists before they occur, and, despite his loud claims of not being able to think clearly as a wolf, he narrates exactly the same way in wolf form as in human form!  Yeesh.<br />I feel somewhat cheated by &quot;Operation Luna.&quot;  It could have been amazing, and it just wasn't.

Their original motivation?  As Richard Feynman says in the first chapter, &quot;A place that's spelled K-Y-Z-Y-L (Tuva's capitol) has just got to be interesting!&quot;<br />The book chronicles the adventures and misadventures of Ralph Leighton, one of Feynman's longtime friends.  Though the book is subtitled &quot;Richard Feynman's Last Journey,&quot; it's really Leighton's story; Feynman is more of an inspiration and a supporting character.  Over several years, Leighton and his friends wrote letters, researched articles, read books, and became more and more fascinated by Tuva, a tiny country in the middle of nowhere.  They learned, among other things, that Tuvans practice three different types of steppe herding lifestyles, within a hundred miles of each other, and that Tuva is the home of throat-singing, a musical technique in which a single person produces two notes at the same time.<br />Leighton's narration is chatty, reminiscent of Feynman's autobiographical works; one suspects Leighton learned to tell anecdotes from his friend.  However, Leighton isn't as inherently fascinating a narrator as Feynman.  Also, Feynman's persistent cancer, which kept him from participating in several preliminary trips, and finally killed him shortly before Leighton received permission for a group of Americans to travel to Tuva itself, casts a pall over the book.<br />Still, this is a fascinating story -- a great example of what people can do if they really care about a cause, and don't realize precisely how little chance they have of succeeding.  It is also informative, if somewhat superficial in its description of Tuvan culture; I now want to know more about Central Asian peoples, and Tuvans in particular.  But while the chapter &quot;Reflections 2000,&quot; included in the new paperback version of &quot;Tuva or Bust!&quot; is interesting, I really don't think it was fair of Leighton to mention a new idea for a Tuvan monument to Feynman, and refuse to give any details.

US	47181995	R106LR3N2H8OBZ	039914269X	339033223	Fantastic four: redemption of the silver surfer (Marvel Comics)	Books	2	1	6	N	N	childish, shallow and mindless	I don't read Fantastic Four comics, so I can't say whether Michael Jan Friedman's novel successfully captures the spirit of the comic book.  However, I must say that if it does, I won't be adding the FF to my comics buying list anytime soon.<br />The plot of &quot;The Redemption of the Silver Surfer&quot; seems promising enough.  The FF are drawn into the Negative Zone by Blastaar, one of their old enemies, who enlists their help against Prodigion, who may or may not be a Negative Zone equivalent of Galactus, the eater of worlds.  The Silver Surfer, Galactus's former Herald, joins the FF in the Negative Zone, where Prodigion perhaps offers him a chance for redemption.  Hence the title.<br />However, Friedman's writing is childish and heavy-handed.  There is no subtlety of characterization; the FF are essentially one-note cardboard-cutouts, and the Surfer's guilt is completely unconvincing.  Given his past, I'd say it must have taken work to make him so shallow.  Great job, Mr. Friedman.  Furthermore, the is-Prodigion-good-or-bad question, which could have been interesting and raised hard ethical issues, gets old very fast.  The ethics never get much more serious than &quot;It's good to help people, and bad to hurt people.&quot;  Wow.  I never knew that.  Thanks for telling me.<br />&quot;Redemption&quot; is a fast read, and fine to fill an otherwise empty afternoon, but I know comics can provide a lot more.  One great thing about superhero comics (besides the action and ridiculous costumes) is their ability to cut to the heart of myths and archetypes, without having to worry about strict realism.  &quot;Redemption&quot; keeps the action and impossible costumes, but it's novelization by the numbers.  It has no deeper level.  Hell, it doesn't even have a human level, to give the action even minimal coherence.  And that hurts.<br />(The illustrations, on the other hand, are great!  Pity there aren't more of them...)	2001-02-11

And she raised interesting issues, though she never really resolved them.  But I think Diane Duane works better with a smaller cast.  Her original novels are fine; they have much smaller casts.  Her Spiderman trilogy is fine; it has only three main characters.  Even her Star Trek novels are fine; she tends not to use more than five major characters per book.  In &quot;Empire's End,&quot; she's dealing with Professor X, Beast, Gambit, Wolverine, Storm, Bishop, Iceman, Cyclops, Jean, Lillandra, a Shi'ar lord, etc.  There are simply too many characters, and though each gets a few scenes or &quot;moments,&quot; they all seem shallow.<br />The plot is as follows: the Shi'ar discover that a mysterious creature, which destabilizes galaxies by eating their cores, is heading their way.  They enlist the X-Men to stop the creature.  This totally unequal confrontation is made &quot;plausible&quot; by a strange device that enhances the X-Men's powers.  Gosh, how convenient.  Meanwhile, Lillandra's council is pressuring her to marry a Shi'ar noble and produce an heir, instead of continuing her relationship with Charles.  Ooh, look, a romantic subplot.<br />There are some interesting discussions about the effects of absolute power, and the enhancement of the X-Men's powers at the expense of the more human aspects of their personalities, but when they finally save the day (you never seriously thought they wouldn't, did you?) those issues vanish like mist, never fully confronted.  The power-enhancing device also conveniently disappears; I sense an author avoiding the implications of a bad concept.<br />Also, I'd really like to know exactly what the huge, ghostly X-Men-shaped constructs are.  They are first described as psychic projections, or something along those lines, but later seem to become real.  They seem to be a device for avoiding the idiocy of pitting the X-Men against a creature larger than Manhattan.  I say, if you're using the X-Men, give them an adversary they can confront as is.  But if you lack the foresight to do that, the least you can do is remain honest to your original premise, and keep the relative sizes of the space creature and the X-Men as is.  (Actually, the ghost figures aren't needed for the final victory, which makes me wonder even more why they were there in the first place.  I sense more bad concepts.)<br />The story is fast and fun, and Duane's style is quite readable, but &quot;Empire's End&quot; feels like a rush job by an author not quite familiar with her world and characters, who tried to make up for the gap by shoving them into Star Trek.an adversary they can confront as is.

However, I don't think it's as disappointing as some people have said.  We merely have higher expectations of Le Guin than of other authors.<br />In &quot;The Telling,&quot; Sutty Dass, born on an Earth ruled by a fanatic, monotheistic theocracy bent on exterminating science, is an Ekumenical Observer on Aka, a planet first contacted by Terrans.  Aka is now ruled by a fanatic, consumeristic technocracy bent on exterminating religion.  Sutty leaves Dovza, the center of the technocracy, and travels to Okzat-Ozkat, a mountain village where some of the old ways survive.  While there, she tries to understand the old Akan philosophsy/religion/way of life, and to learn why Aka has changed so radically.  It is true that Sutty's character is a bit hard to pin down, but I think that's because she's avoiding her past and doesn't understand herself.<br />Le Guin's writing is subtle, and should be read slowly; if you miss any little detail, the whole picture becomes blurred and two-dimensional.  While some reviewers have said that Le Guin shows the Corporation State as Bad, and the old ways, known as the Telling, as Good, they are missing details.  The Telling was perverted in Dovza before the Terrans came, and the Corporation was in part a reaction against that, which is perfectly understandable.  Furthermore, the Corporation embodies some values of the Telling, and much of its fanaticism against religion comes not from a reaction against Akan culture, but against the Terran theocracy.  Also, Aka suffered from wars and sickness under the old ways, and the Telling contains a lot of mystic mumbo-jumbo; it's not perfect.<br />Still, these things are subtle, and one of the other complaints, that much is told while little is shown, is fairly accurate.  Le Guin has said that the best writing should completely embody a theme within its characters and story, so you don't realize you're reading a sermon of sorts; she has also said she tends to fail at total embodiment of themes.  She fails again here.  But &quot;The Telling&quot; is lovely and poetic, despite a deliberate pace and an occasional sense of preachiness.<br />I do wish Le Guin had drawn her characters a bit more clearly.  I wish the ending didn't feel quite so rushed.  I wish she had shown a bit more of Sutty's research into the Telling, which I found quite interesting.  But I think some of the abruptness and lack of explanation come because she's demonstrating a characteristic of the Telling: to tell, not to explain.<br />If speculative literature makes you think, whether you agree with the book's premise or not, it succeeds.  By that criterion, I think &quot;The Telling&quot; is successful.  If a novel is enjoyable, it also succeeds.  For me, &quot;The Telling&quot; is successful on both levels.s also said she tends to fail at total embodiment of themes.  She fails again here.

I care deeply about the English language, especially proper grammar.  If you asked my friends and family, I suspect they might even use the word &quot;fanatic&quot; to describe me.  Therefore, believe me when I say the non-standard English in &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; is not hard to understand after a few pages, and that it is integral to the characterization of Mannie and Lunar society.  There are times and places for linguistic purism.  This is not one of them.<br />Computer technician Manuel Garcia O'Kelley Davis is a free citizen of a Lunar penal colony, run for Earth's benefit.  He discovers the master computer (it manages telephones, newspapers, electricity, air supply, etc.) is sentient, names it Mike, and befriends it/him.  In his efforts to humanize Mike, Mannie introduces the computer to Wyoming Knott, a fiery member of a flawed revolutionary organization, and to Professor Bernardo de la Paz, a lovable rational anarchist.  With Mike's help, they determine that under current management policies, famine will strike the Moon.  Being Loonies, they gamble on a revolution.  A real one.<br />One pleasure of this book is learning about Lunar society, which Heinlein creates with great attention to detail.  (Hence the language.)  The other great pleasure is watching the revolution develop.  The propaganda, misdirection, government machinations, and ingenious weapons (yes, throwing rice can be deadly - if you throw from the Moon!) are marvelous.  I didn't notice much overt characterization, but by the end of the book, I cared about these people; I had traveled a long way with them.<br />&quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; contains libertarian, or anarchist, philosophy, but one purpose of science fiction is to present challenging ideas.  Whether or not you agree with the Loonies' political philosophy, or are offended by some of their social structures (such as their forms of marriage) I defy anyone not to sympathize with their quest for freedom.<br />Note: While I find Heinlein's obsession with female bodies a bit annoying, and while he uses some sexual stereotypes, any society where a woman, as he says, &quot;calls tune,&quot; and a man has to dance to it, can't be all bad!/>Note: While I find Heinlein's obsession with female bodies a bit annoying, and while he uses some sexual stereotypes, any society where a woman, as he says, &quot;calls tune,&quot; and a man has to dance to it, can't be all bad!	2001-02-05

I think it's also one of the better Discworld books, but since people seem to have such idiosyncratic favorites, I can't really predict whether anyone else will agree.  Nevertheless, if you like Pratchett at all, you will like &quot;The Truth.&quot;<br />&quot;The Truth&quot; is like &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; or &quot;Soul Music,&quot; which take cultural staples from our world and introduce them to Discworld, where they always end up slightly...wrong.  However, it appears that, unlike movies and rock and roll, newspapers don't drain the reality from Discworld, and so are here to stay.<br />Early in &quot;The Truth,&quot; William de Worde, the disaffected son of an old noble family, meets a group of dwarves who have introduced the printing press and movable type to Ankh-Morpork.  Shortly, William and company are printing the Ankh-Morpork Times, Discworld's first daily newspaper, and competing with Discworld's first tabloid.  On a more serious note, Lord Vetinari has apparently attacked his secretary and attempted to flee with embezled city funds.  William suspects the Patrician has been framed, and invents investigative journalism, which is likely to get him killed.<br />&quot;The Truth&quot; offers an outsider's view of the Watch and Vimes -- very interesting -- and continues to modernize Ankh-Morpork, in a sideways, upside-down fashion, of course.  Many old characters make cameos, including the Bursar, Gaspode, Carrot, Angua, C.M.O.T. Dibbler, and Nobby.  It also introduces Mr. Tulip, a criminal who wants to have a drug habit; Sacharissa, William's partner and chief reporter; and Otto, a vampire who has sworn off blood and taken up flash photography, a dangerous profession for a creature sensitive to light.<br />There aren't as many footnotes in &quot;The Truth&quot; as in some other Discworld novels, but the satire is dead on, and the humor is still present, just more intertwined with the actual story.  &quot;The Truth&quot; will probably also appeal to first-time Pratchett readers more than some other Discworld novels.or is still present, just more intertwined with the actual story.  &quot;The Truth&quot; will probably also appeal to first-time Pratchett readers more than some other Discworld novels.	2001-01-25

Hamilton's Anita Blake series; the books move fast, have monsters, magic, action, mystery, sex, moral dilemmas, and are narrated by Anita, my favorite tough woman...what more do you want?  Unfortunately, I found it impossible to keep Anita out of my mind while reading &quot;Kiss of Shadows,&quot; which is narrated by Merry Gentry, another tough woman with weird powers.  Merry and Anita sound alike, are surrounded by gorgeous supernatural men, and look alike -- allowing for Merry's tri-colored eyes and glowing white skin; she is part sidhe, after all.<br />I think, on the whole, I prefer Anita.  This has little to do with Merry herself, but more with the two women's respective worlds and Hamilton's plotting, or lack thereof.  Anita has a sense of purpose and reality, despite her crazy circumstances.  Merry has a job at the beginning of &quot;Kiss of Shadows,&quot; but it's only used to introduce a sex scene and reveal her as the missing Princess Meredith NicEssus, niece of the Unseelie Court's Queen of Air and Darkness.<br />The whole book is like that; it lacks purpose, and meanders through tenuously connected episodes.  After Merry's cover is blown, the sluagh come to town, and there is fighting.  Then Doyle, the Queen's messenger, arrives to take Merry home.  Then Merry meets some old friends at the airport.  Then she confronts her cousin.  Then she talks to her aunt, and the conversation takes odd turns.  Then she is attacked by magic.  And so on.  Things just happen, one after another.<br />The episodes work well by themselves, and the society of the Unseelie Court is interesting, but the story lacks cohesion.  Each Anita book coheres around a mystery, and often a change in Anita's character.  If there's a uniting plot thread in &quot;Kiss of Shadows,&quot; I couldn't find it.<br />&quot;Kiss of Shadows&quot; feels like a drawn-out introductory chapter.

He soon learns he's stumbled into a cliche fantasy world, during the final battle between Good and Evil.  It's fun to have a person who doesn't automatically reject Evil, and Bogey's adjustment to his new body puts an interesting spin on the story.  There is also a moral message: Good is good,  Evil is evil, big business and lawyers are often on the side of Evil, and riches aren't really worth much if you're not Good.  This is not earthshaking news.<br />Fun though &quot;Top Dog&quot; is, it's nothing very special.  The basic story has been done hundreds of times, often much better.  Caroll's fantasy world, though realistic enough to be grubby (thank goodness!), never becomes fully real; whole towns can burn, and we don't care, because the inhabitants seem like plot devices, not people.  The Fair Lands remain a sketchy backdrop for the characters -- Bogey, a bumbling inventor, an angel, an evil wizard, and the devil -- who are themselves thinly disguised cliches.  (Note: the only significant female character in &quot;Top Dog&quot; is Bogey's rich, spoiled wife, seen in flashbacks to Bogey's life in our world.)<br />The moral issues are drawn in a very simplistic, black-or-white manner.  While the question of why god allows evil is raised, it is never satisfactorily addressed; Caroll sidesteps it with a climactic battle and Bogey's personal moral reformation.  And that reformation...despite his constant talk of costs and benefits over morals, I never quite believed Bogey would join Evil.  Since he makes such an issue of choosing sides, I hoped that either he would be more of a stinker, or that Caroll would show Evil as the seductive, adaptive, terrifying force it really is.  No such luck, unfortunately; it becomes a bad cartoon.<br />Basically, &quot;Top Dog&quot; is a minor, though amusing, variation on a very standard plot.

I didn't expect more than a standard, entertaining slash-em-up, and am delighted at how wrong I was.<br />&quot;Heroes Die&quot; follows anti-hero Hari Michelson, an Actor (the capital is warranted; this is not the acting we know) in an unpleasant, caste-bound future whose job is, basically, to kill people in another reality for the entertainment of the rich Leisure caste on Earth.  On Overworld -- a gritty medieval fantasy setting -- Hari is Caine, a legendary assassin and warrior; his excessively bloody adventures have made him immensely popular back on Earth.  As the book opens, he is estranged from his wife Shanna, an Actor who plays magician Pallas Ril.  On Overworld, she poses as Simon Jester (a nod to Heinlein), champion of the lower classes.  However, she has vanished from the studio's tracking systems and will soon fall back to Earth, fatally and uncontrollably.<br />Hari is sent to Overworld to rescue his wife, depose the suspiciously godlike emperor of Ankhana, and revive the studio's fortunes.  The story includes betrayals, mysteries, megalomaniacs, daring escapes and rescues, gods, magic, gobs of violence, and a climactic final confrontation.  &quot;Heroes Die&quot; works beautifully as a straight adventure, but also contains much more.  The characters are well-developed (though the villains are occasionally a bit two-dimensional) which gives weight and meaning to their ordeals and changes.  And the entire adventure is colored by the ethics of the studio system and the political situations in both worlds.<br />But the story is not flawless.  Stover dangles some portentious hints and ideas that unfortunately never amount to much.  He also never resolves his ethical and political dilemmas to my satisfaction.  After taking the trouble to set them up, he shunts them aside or tries to subsume them in Hari's struggle with the studio head and his relationship with Shanna.  Given that little changes on Earth, the ending seems unreasonably upbeat; it's also a letdown after the government's grave concern that Hari's subvocalized political musings might affect the people who live his adventure with him.<br />Despite the loose ends, Stover does a fantastic job bringing plots strands together while maintaining suspense and a breakneck pace.  He integrates serious issues without making his story one bit less enjoyable.  I honestly think he could have resolved even the dangling bits and still made everything work.

Arthur also provides an immediate hook into the story, which contains some of the most recognizably human characters I have yet found in an epic.  Finally the knights are real, the whole bloody lot of abrasive, pigheaded men torn between loyalty to their clans and to the whole of Britain.  Finally the women are real; Morgana is a very interesting twist on a Faerie queen, and Guinevere, long cast as a scheming adulteress or a weepy deadweight, at last stands as Arthur's equal and his most worthy opponent.  As Arthur says, most kings have wives, but he had a queen.  (Btw, if you like her here, read &quot;Beloved Exile.&quot;)<br />The tale is a bit nonstandard, in that Arthur's father Uther is merely a Romanized noble, not the king of Britain; Arthur suceeds Ambrosius directly.  Merlin is mostly absent, as is any overt magic, and when he does appear is anything but a bearded old man.  Religion is largely a catch-as-catch-can issue in the complex, often self-destructive British society; there is also no Grail.<br />Instead, we get a look at a gritty, tumultuous period in the history of Britain through the eyes of a flawed, ambitious man who develops vision and compassion while stumbling towards true nobility.  I cannot speak for historical accuracy, but the way things fall apart is stunning in its subtle inevitability; the characters react to each other and their environment in ways that seem natural, not forced by a preordained plot.  Arthur and Guinevere's last effort to redeem themselves and patch things together has such desperate, moving potential that I find myself pleading with fate each time the story marches, naturally and relentlessly, to Camlan, where Modred fulfills his destiny.<br />And the ending is priceless..	2000-11-30

His longer works, while also brilliant, have an unfortunate tendency to lag at points, but in short form he shines.  Though not all the stories are of equal quality (hey, everyone has bad days), none are bad, and many are things of beauty and power.

It also covers other standard territory: the gifted child, the troubled family, and the slow understanding of an alien culture.<br />No story in this volume is bad, though I personally found &quot;Saint Amy's Tale&quot; a bit confused and not equal to the others.  &quot;Saving Grace&quot; and &quot;Kingsmeat,&quot; on the other hand, are very powerful, and the award-winning &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot; is a moving character study.<br />Be warned: this book is not always pleasant to read; it contains some extremely disturbing images, especially in &quot;Kingsmeat.&quot;  But as an examination of the power of religion (for good or otherwise), it is invaluable.	2000-11-30

However, the fact that the heroes are villains, out to save the world from the forces of good, makes all the difference.  Besides which, Eve Forward is perfectly well aware that her story is derrivative, and pokes fun at cliches even as she uses them.<br />Our &quot;heroes&quot; are Sam, a depressed and unemployed assassin; his thieving friend Arcie; Kaylana, the druid who warns them of the world's immanent destruction; Valeriana, the evil sorceress; a dark knight who never speaks or raises his visor; and the centaur Robin, a rather hapless young minstrel.  They travel through the Six Lands, searching for pieces of the key that will open the Dark Gate and return evil to the world.  As their quest progressed, I did find myself wishing Forward had been slightly less tied to the strict conventions of epic-quest fantasy, which forces her characters and plot into a very familiar pattern.  But though the story arc and episode types are predictable, the details are well-handled; many scenes are utterly hilarious, and some are unexpectedly poignant.<br />There are a few efforts at philosophy, including discussions about the relationship of ultimate good and ultimate evil; both are dangerous and meaningless without each other.  The idea that no worthwhile art has been created since evil was vanquished strikes me as dead-on accurate.  And the secrets of Valerie's past, while never making her in any way a nice person, do illuminate the sticky, evasive morality inherent in battles against &quot;irredeemably evil&quot; creatures.<br />Mostly, though, &quot;Villains by Necessity&quot; is just sheer fun, very welcome to anyone who ever secretly doubted unicorns' perfection and dragons' nobility, found the villains more interesting (and human) than the heroes, and wished that after all their effort, the bad guys could finally win.

I first met Arithon and Lysaer in &quot;Warhost of Vastmark,&quot; then read &quot;Curse of the Mistwraith&quot; and &quot;Fugitive Prince,&quot; and began &quot;Grand Conspiracy&quot; before I finally found a copy of &quot;Ships of Merior.&quot;  It was a great relief to understand (at last!) the many back references.<br />&quot;Ships of Merior&quot; was originally the first part of a huge hardcover, with &quot;Warhost of Vastmark&quot; being the second half.  I think this explains the slow pace of the book; it's not meant to stand on its own, even within the series; it's meant to set up &quot;Warhost.&quot;  We open a few years after the battle that ended &quot;Curse.&quot;  Arithon has been traveling with the Masterbard, while Lysaer has been living in Etarra.  Dakar is sent to Arithon, and is unaware, for quite a long time, that he has found him; Arithon is nothing if not a master of disguise.<br />The story takes Arithon and Dakar (who can become tiresome in his drunkenness and hatred of Arithon) through several seemingly unconnected events, while Lysaer begins to take control of Tysan and gathers an army to destroy Arithon.  Eventually, the brothers meet in yet another climactic battle, in which Arithon again uses guile and shadows to drive Lysaer back, at a great cost in lives.  A strength of this series is the pain both brothers feel when others die in their personal war; all too often, common soldiers die and it is merely regretable, but Arithon feels each death like his own, and Lysaer (though becoming less likeable) is also tormented.  Sadly, the Mistrwraith's curse twists his pain away from the obvious course -- peace -- into renewed determination to capture and kill his brother.  Thus do the Wars of Light and Shadow (fortunately for us, unfortunately for the characters) continue.<br />The transitions between events are not always smooth, and some motivations are a bit sketchy.  For example, Dakar distrusts Arithon because he misinterpreted Asandir's reasons for memory-blocking the Master of Shadows in &quot;Curse,&quot; and because he doesn't know why Arithon used dark sorcery during the battle in Strakewood.  This is not clarified well.  Also, Wurts continues to overwrite.  She rarely seems content with one adjective where she can fit two, or a simple sentence where she can twist it around.<br />Still, &quot;Ships of Merior&quot; does a wonderful job of showing the characters moving through their world.  Elaira takes a larger role, Lysaer shoulders the burdens of a kingdom and a cause (at some cost to his original morals), and Arithon's prickly, difficult character is examined in greater depth; he has quickly become my favorite hero/anti-hero.ot always smooth, and some motivations are a bit sketchy.

US	47181995	R1YMNBJI5K97BR	1573456632	726126541	Stone Tables	Books	4	7	8	N	N	serious religion, (mostly) believable characters	To begin: I am not now and never will be a Mormon.  I am, however, religious, though perhaps not in the classic Western sense of the word.  I am a humanist Unitarian Universalist with mild pagan sympathies, a respect for the mystery of the world, and a deep distrust of benevolent omnipotent beings unifying, all-encompassing plans.  Given that background, I admit I was slightly unnerved when Moses is granted knowledge of Jesus and prays in his name, given that Moses, if he lived, lived a loooong time before Jesus was born, let alone crucified.  I was more or less familiar with the other divine elements in &quot;Stone Tables,&quot; (living in this country, who isn't?) but that one threw me for a loop.<br />With that out of the way, I would like to say that personal religious views need not affect your acceptance of a character's religion, especially when religion is integral to his or her personality.  Also, stories of triumph over adversity are moving, no matter what the character relies upon to overcome her or his troubles.  &quot;Stone Tables&quot; is the story of several triumphs, most especially Moses' discovery of purpose and the Hebrews' journey to freedom.  Yes, I knew the ending before I began reading (come to that, how many books have you read in which the &quot;chosen&quot; people, whoever chooses them, lose?) but the pleasure is in getting there, in watching stiff Old Testament characters become painfully real.  Yes, and seeing them interact with an undoubtedly real god.<br />I refrain from giving &quot;Stone Tables&quot; five stars because, good though it is, it could have been better.  Some characters, such as Aaron, become flat and repetitive; beside the more human characters, they are jarring.  Also, Moses' wife (whose name I confess I have forgotten), engaging in the early sections, later recedes to the background along with Moses' concerns for his family.  The whole story, in fact, weakens toward the end; I think the two trends are not unrelated.  One of OSC's greatest strengths is showing realistic family interactions and the influence of families on all of a character's actions.  Why, then, did he neglect this?<br />Despite my few reservations, &quot;Stone Tables&quot; is a wonderful book: an adventure, a coming-of-age (and what comes after), and a rare and effective portrait of people whose religion is truly part of their lives.e of OSC's greatest strengths is showing realistic family interactions and the influence of families on all of a character's actions.

I love her ability to create moving and absorbing characters, an interconnected plot, and wonderful descriptive passages (when she isn't tripping over her own wordiness, that is).  So when I found &quot;The Master of White Storm&quot; in a library I thought, &quot;Hey, it's Janny Wurts; even if it's an early work, it must be decent.&quot;<br />Sadly, I was wrong.  Korendir's friend is an instantly forgettable whiner; the only reason I remember his existence (though not his name) is that, unfortunately, much of the story is seen through his eyes.  To be fair, he also has one brief, moving scene at the end of the book.  Korendir could have been interesting, but is never seen clearly enough until the end.  And after his motivations are finally somewhat clarified, I found some of his earlier actions even less explicable.  Furthermore, the magic is not well thought-out; it is neither mystical enough to be left largely unexplained nor coherent enough to be believable.<br />&quot;The Master of White Storm&quot; tells the story of Korendir, a man with a mysterious past, who escapes from slavers and becomes a hero-for-hire.  He wants to build an impregnable fortress, called, unsuprisingly, White Storm.  His badly connected adventures are uniformly depressing, though otherwise dissimilar, and the plot threads involving his heritage and his wife read like a late attempt to add meaning to an essentially lightweight story.  The book struggles to meld episodic adventure with deep, philosophical questions about human nature and motivations; it is, perhaps, a noble attempt to humanize an adventurer, but in my opinion, it fails.  It doesn't work well as an adventure (too moody and slow) or as a serious novel (too disjointed and vague).<br />Reading &quot;The Master of White Storm&quot; is a reasonable way to fill an otherwise empty afternoon (unless you have other books available), but nothing more.  And don't be surprised if you find yourself wondering just what exactly Janny Wurts was thinking when she wrote it.noon (unless you have other books available), but nothing more.

If Zelazny had never written anything else, this one novel would qualify him for immortality.  It is far better and more meaningful than his Chronicles of Amber.<br />&quot;Lord of Light&quot; follows Sam, a man (or is he a god?) who seeks to overthrow the despotic rulers of a colony world.  The rulers, humans with peculiar powers who live forever by transferring their essences into new bodies, play gods in a mutated version of Hinduism.  They control the means of reincarnation; those who oppose them are reborn as dogs, or worse.  Sam assumes many personas in his long quest to depose the gods, and he meets fascinating characters such as Rild, the assassin sent to kill him; the death-god Yama, whose eyes drink life; Tak, the ape who is more than he seems; the goddess Kali in her many incarnations; Ratri, the goddess of the night; and Taraka, the strongest of the demons.<br />The story is told in a long flashback, which gives Sam's quest a sense of weight and inevitability.  Zelazny's style is perfectly matched to the story.  Quotations from various holy texts head each chapter, offering insight into the world's culture and the religions on which the story is based.<br />&quot;Lord of Light&quot; is a powerful story of a stuggle against tyranny.  It is also a story of religion (pure and twisted), loss, love, the implications of immortality, and the meaning of humanity.  I wouldn't say the book changed my life, but it gave me an understanding of holiness, of the tragedy and comedy of humanity, and of the presence of truth and beauty in seemingly unlikely places.<br />After an incredible story, &quot;Lord of Light&quot; delivers one of the most perfect endings I have ever read; the last pages should be enshrined.  The only complaints I have about the book are the typos, the comparative scarcity of female characters, and the fact that it had to end at all.	2000-11-28

If you find a copy, buy it, read it, cherish it, and know you have my undying envy (I have to rely on libraries).<br />In this book, Zelazny freely borrows from Stoker, Shelly, Conan Doyle, and Lovecraft (most especially Lovecraft!), screen adaptations of the same, and other popular touchstones.  &quot;A Night in the Lonesome October&quot; follows 31 days in the lives of watchdog Snuff and his master Jack, as they prepare for a Halloween ritual.  Some players want to bring Lovecraft's ancient gods of chaos back to earth; some want to banish them, at least until the next ritual.  Discovering who is who and what is where are vital tasks.  The story works in its own right, but the more familiar you are with Zelazny's sources, the more fun it is to read.<br />The book is not as powerful as some of Zelazny's works, but it is wickedly fun and well worth rereading (many times!) to catch and savor the details.	2000-11-28

However, I would advise reading her other books before this one; it is not as easily accessible as some.<br />&quot;Basilisk&quot; is the story of Rook, a musician who lives with the bards of Luly and has avoided his past for over thirty years.  Eventually he is forced to remember, and he travels to the city of Berylon to right a decades-old wrong done to his family.<br />But &quot;Basilisk&quot; is not a typical revenge quest, and it holds far more than Rook's story.  It tells the stories of Guilia Dulcet, a musician from the provinces; of Justin, a young man with secret plans; of Luna Pellior, the Basilisk's mysterious and powerful daughter; of Hexel Barr, the distracted, irate composer; of Damiet Pellior, the Basilisk's other daughter; of Hollis, Rook's impatient and protective son; and other intriguing characters.<br />I have read this book many times, and each time it quickly pulls me into a dreamworld where everything is hidden or cast in a new light.  Yes, the characterizations are subtle, and the magic is unexplained.  Yes, the first few pages are confusing the first time.  Yes, the story moves slowly.  However, if you accept the book on its own terms, it is rewarding, and will linger with you for weeks.<br />This is one of the few books I can read over and over, and never find myself skipping ahead to the &quot;good parts.&quot;  The whole book is that good.	2000-11-27

I wasn't even aware it was the second book in a series until I told my father I loved it.  He, fortunately, owned all four books.  After many years, &quot;Tombs&quot; is still my favorite Earthsea novel, though I admit I may be biased because it was the first one I read, and I read it while I was a young girl.<br />&quot;Tombs&quot; is a portrait of an isolated girl who struggles to find acceptable values, and to become a free and responsible human being.  Tenar/Arha is a priestess who serves the nameless powers of the earth.  The early chapters show her life in a religious community, and her first steps towards becoming a woman.  Later, she encounters Ged, a wizard on a quest of his own.  Tenar and Ged are believable characters, whose journey and friendship avoid an artificially happy and neatly-wrapped ending.  &quot;Tombs&quot; was a godsend to me; in it, I found a strong female character who didn't have a stereotypical relationship with a &quot;hero,&quot; and a thoughtful portrayal of the true meaning of adulthood and freedom.<br />For many years, the Earthsea books were a trilogy, with &quot;Tombs&quot; the odd book out.  Ged, here a supporting character (though vital!) is the all-important protagonist of the male-dominated &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea.&quot;  And as far as &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; is concerned, Tenar might as well never have lived.  I was fortunate enough to read the series after Le Guin completed it with &quot;Tehanu,&quot; which again focuses on Tenar.<br />I am grateful I read the series out of order, because I find the tetrology a balancing act between two perspectives on life: outer-directed, and inner-directed, with Ged representing the former and Tenar the latter.  At the end of &quot;Tehanu,&quot; the two characters have learned, aged, and come to terms with themselves and each other.  Without &quot;Tombs,&quot; &quot;Tehanu&quot; is incomprehensible.<br />&quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; is also a miracle in its own right.r.

US	47181995	R1LS9SK3LP4XWE	0345314255	643750532	The Sword of Shannara	Books	4	3	6	N	N	good, but not great	(More precisely, I give this three and a half stars, but I liked it enough, as casual reading, to round up rather than down.)<br />I discovered Terry Brooks when I was young, but after I had already fallen in love with Tolkien, Le Guin, and McKillip.  That previous experience perhaps kept me from appreciating &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; the way many other readers did.  It was not a revelation to me.  I enjoyed the book, but not excessively, was certainly able to put it down at various points, and never cared to reread more than a few passages.<br />&quot;Sword&quot; follows Shea Ohmsford, the only person who can wield the magical Sword of Shannara (Shannara is a person, not a place, incidentally) and thus defeat the evil Warlock Lord who threatens the four lands of the known world.  The sword's powers are not quite what one expects -- a nice surprise, given that the story is otherwise a fairly standard epic quest.  The large cast includes the usual characters, such as a faithful friend (Flick) and a mysterious stranger who is magical, wise, and somewhat inscrutable (the druid Allanon).  The tone is serious -- after all, the fate of the world is at stake -- which prevents the book from being as enjoyable as pure entertainment as it might be.  Instead, it reaches for depth and message; it does not quite succeed.<br />I liked the idea behind the sword, and enjoyed the hints that the four lands exist in our own distant future, after a catastrophe devastated the world and recreated magic.  I found Allanon intriguing and somewhat compelling; he seemed the most real of the characters, most of whom, unfortunately, never quite rise from the page.  However, while entertaining, and of better quality than much of what passes for serious fantasy, &quot;Sword&quot; lacks the depth and true magic evoked by the best and most original works.  It does not transcend the genre.	2000-11-27

I had lived as Ender and Valentine and I expected them to quickly appear; this was a sequel, wasn't it?  Unfamiliar characters such as Pipo, Libo, and Novinha bored and confused me.  I skimmed until I found Ender on Trondheim, still haunted by his childhood.  From then on, I was hooked, and when Ender reached Lusitania, I discovered the people weren't boring at all; they became real.<br />The plot of &quot;Speaker&quot; is fairly simple.  The native pequininos on Lusitania are the only sentient species found in the thousands of years since &quot;Ender's Game.&quot;  For no apparent reason, they kill two human scientists, eerily echoing humanity's violent first contact with the Buggers.  Ender arrives on Lusitania, where, with the help of Jane (a sentient computer program) he tries to understand the pequininos, Novinha's family, and the community of Milagre.<br />&quot;Ender's Game&quot; was an adventure story about a brilliant child, made sympathetic by his isolation and empathy.  &quot;Speaker&quot; is a much more complex novel, which deals with family, community, religion, truth, and the nature of humanity; its characters and ideas are as important as the plot, if not more so.  Those who loved &quot;Ender's Game&quot; for its action and boy-against-the-world theme may not like &quot;Speaker.&quot;  However, those who loved &quot;Ender's Game&quot; as much for its characters and ideas as its plot will find &quot;Speaker&quot; incredibly rewarding.<br />The first time I read &quot;Speaker,&quot; I was thirteen.  While I liked the book, I missed the faster pace of &quot;Ender's Game.&quot;  However, over the years, I have come to love &quot;Speaker,&quot; opening chapters and all, more than the other books in this series.  My one quibble is the conclusion; though tonally perfect, it leaves enough loose ends to fill....two more books!<br />&quot;Speaker&quot; belongs to the special group of books, science fiction and otherwise, that treat religious and ethical issues seriously.  Whether or not you agree with OSC's conclusions (or completely believe Ender's Speaking for Marcos could occur in our universe) the book raises important questions within a moving story about characters with real problems.  It also recognizes that people have families, cultures, and other community ties.<br />To summarize, &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; is a wonderful novel that uses believable characters to raise questions about human existence.  Like &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; it explores alienation and misunderstanding, but it is a richer and slower book, and in my opinion, better.<br />(If you like &quot;Speaker,&quot; I highly recommend OSC's &quot;Hart's Hope,&quot; a fantasy with similar themes.

In some ways, I regret not being able to come to &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; with no expectations and foreknowledge, but I am also grateful, because I knew there was a purpose behind the slow points, and I appreciated the detailed background.  The Wheel of Time series deals with an epic struggle to save the world; without understanding the world, why would anyone care about saving it?<br />&quot;The Eye of the World&quot; is indeed slow, especially at the beginning.  However, it creates a world whose distances and kingdoms feel real, and lays background for the characters' later actions.  Also, in this book, Jordan has not yet descended into the rather stereotypical, two-dimensional portraits of Elaine and Nynaeve that mar the later series.<br />I loved the way the young people from Emond's Field were drawn into events they slowly discovered to be earthshaking.  I began knowing little about the world (it is a testament to Jordan at his best that I was often absorbed enough to forget what I knew from &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot;) and learned about its beauties and troubles with Rand and his friends as they traveled, searching for each other and for the Eye.  This is one of the better introductions to a world that I have read, and would be worth reading simply to appreciate Jordan's milieu.<br />On the basis of this book, I loved Nynaeve.  She was a character to leaven the others: older and more resourceful than Rand, Perrin, Mat, and Egwene, but less inscrutable and powerful than Moiraine and Lan.  There is a scene late in the book, where Rand overhears a conversation between Lan and Nynaeve, that broke my heart.  I admit I hated Jordan when, by &quot;The Shadow Rising,&quot; Nynaeve mysteriously became a youthened cardboard cutout with no relation to her previous self beyond her name, her relationship with Lan, and her inability to access her powers.  &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; and &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; show that Jordan can portray reasonable female characters, and originally made some effort to do so.  It is a great pity that he later abandoned his characterizations for an irritating reliance on the old, tired &quot;war between the sexes.&quot;<br />Despite its slow pace and somewhat meandering plot, &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; is necessary to fully appreciate Jordan's world and epic vision.  Its characterizations also provide a welcome antidote to some of his later failings.access her powers.  &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; and &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; show that Jordan can portray reasonable female characters, and originally made some effort to do so.
