Frist, Sr	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Like Rush Limbaugh, just no politics	This is the original saga of the good Frist family of Tennessee, who were good people, descended from good people. They were not yet out to do good in the world. This would not happen until young Bill Frist, who was of course good, decided more money could be produced by doing good in politics than by doing good in the HMO industry.<br /><br />So, if you want homegrown ostentated goodness, the good old Tennessee kind, with smiling yet stern pater familias and simpering mater familias, well behaved, good children, all sitting on the porch laughing as the mockingbirds dive-bomb the non-good alley cats and human riff-raff out in the street, with godknowswhat going on in foreign countries, here's your story. Stay away from politics, where it is impossible to be GOOD, it's enough to make a good Tennessee Christian cut loose cussing.	2005-10-05

Odd, poking at a library database (a big one, because most libraries can't be prevailed on to buy this sort of thing) reveals that there was a book, of the same arrogant and desperation-inducing title (I mean, I don't know about you, but I've had some BAD people among my antecedents; will we, corporately taken, ever make GOOD?) written & published about \\"Thomas F. Frist, Sr.\\", presumably the good daddy of good Bill, and written by some operator named Karl F. VanDevender. And now we have this new edition, written by, it says, \\"William H. Frist and Shirley Wilson\\". Now, what's the story here? Is the ostensibly GOOD William H. Frist UN-good enough to have plagiarized his very own daddy's book (and it was a GOOD daddy too) and passed it off as his own? (Let's forget the business about Shirley Wilson; I suppose he PAID her to actually write the thing, and a contract is a contract, there's nothing GOOD or BAD about it.)  I suppose it all had something to do with going from the medical business, these days in such disrepute, what with nobody being able to afford seeing a doctor and getting no results when they do, and going into the even MORE disreputable business of politics. What? You say it will get better, that is to say, MORE GOOD, when GOOD people, begotten by GOOD people, get into it? That's GOOD! So, just in case there was a mistake, don't just settle for a GOOD person. Make sure that it was a GOOD person, who was sired and dammed and GOODLY begotten, by GOOD persons, who had GOOD thoughts while they were begetting this GOOD person. And, for full measure of GOODNESS, make sure the GOOD person was born in a GOOD place, in the middle of a GOOD country, and there's only one that can be counted on to be GOOD, namely America. But, just to make sure, get the GOOD person is a reliably GOOD state, like the State of Tennessee. That will be GOOD, even if you're NO GOOD yourself.  [...]	2005-10-04

Why do you need a plot when you've got great history? The South, the Lost Cause, General Nathan Bedford Forrest, who did so much not only to kill Ohio & New York and Illinois boys during the War but really put the fear of God (or something) into them when they tried to Do Business in the South after the Cause was Lost, using everything from fire to white sheets to scare the meddlesome carpetbaggers back where they came from. Or else. <br />The nobility of the Lost Cause!

And it's true, too, that the obscene assault on Japanese ethnics in 1941, the result of FDR's pandering to the vituperative bigots in California, including not just city hicks and rustics who wanted to steal sweat-of-the-brow businesses and Cal's most productive farms for themselves, but local bigshots like Earl Warren, did NOT lead to what could sensibly be called \\"concentration camps\\" in today's parlance, even though FDR himself used this term. No one was gassed, no one was tortured, AND the US began backing out of this folly after the first year, with subsequent administrators of these camps doing everything they could to resettle the victims of this populism (opposed by even the then not-yet-old paranoiac J. Edgar Hoover)in less benighted parts of the country like Chicago. It was one of the worst mistakes in US history, but NOT on a par with slavery or the assault on the lives and cultures of the American Indians. <br />Malkin's book turns out to be just a professionally right wing screed that does nothing to relativize some of the rhetorical excess flying around these issues. \\"Racist\\" is a word flung around way too much by too many people, but if someone called this society dame of the nut right, a true sorority sister of Ann Coulter, a \\"racist\\", I don't think I could defend her. <br />The most enlightening book on the Japanese American internment may still be the first one: <br />Prejudice : Japanese-Americans : symbols of racial intolerance <br />by Carey McWilliams, published in 1944. <br />Thisauthor excoriated the initiative and its authors; nonetheless, you'll see plenty of evidence in this book, amazingly published in the thick of WW2, that those saddled with administering this obscenity detested it and were attempting all the palliative measures they could devise in the face of government inertia and local racisms in California and elsewhere. <br />And yes, many people were victimized by \\"patriotism\\" and the delight that good citizens everywhere, not just California, take in proving that blood is thicker than water and that \\"real Americans\\" are so-and-so and such-and-such. Among these were German-Americans and German nationals who had nothing whatsoever to do with the National Socialist government; read: <br />Undue process : the untold story of America's German alien internees <br />by Arnold Krammer, published in 1997. <br />Yes, the made-for-television-movies about the Japanese-American internment tell an idiotically simplified story, and yes, television doesn't pick up on the victimization of many of history's victims, and yes, there is a real case to be made, one you won't hear on television,  for considering a person's affiliation with a nut religion like Wahhabi Islam or Protestant fundamentalism when assessing the likelihood that they'll defend God's honor with hijacked airliners or a lot of fertilizer. But why don't you just stop watching television? And why don't you stop buying un-researched, un-reflected racist and war-mongering screeds like the kind Regnery Press churns out? Like Malkin's tripe. Just let her wait until it's HER turn to be \\"profiled\\" or \\"interned\\". THEN we can extend a sympathetic ear to her self-righteous howlings. <br />	2005-08-13

Well, contact with self-righteous, self-centered, holy-no-matter-what religious types over the years teaches you that it's EASY for someone who believes in nothing in particular to BELIEVE IT WITH HEART AND SOUL, to use G.'s own original eloquence. \\"Where are we going, why are we here etc.\\" were the kind of questions that motivated this character who, as his former business associate Paul McCartney managed to say in weak eulogy, \\"didn't suffer fools gladly\\", e.g. tore up the bits of paper proffered to him by star-struck kiddies or signed all of the Fab Four when sought for his own unique sign, the sign that he did indeed inhabit the same universe that the rest of us milling around outside of his preposterous mansions were forced to inhabit.  <br />Did this guy EVER do anything for anybody else? <br />Try Catholicism, Judaism, Baha'i, deism, radical atheism, anything other than \\"I'm-too-good-for-the-worldism\\".  <br />Or if you want to stay with the Beatles, stick with jabberin' John, who seems to have been more or less sincere in his peaceniking, or send a card to Paul, who's done some good in the world and certainly deserves to get a card on his 64th.

They hoped he would take it over. But he was stymied and so thoroughly neutralized that Illinois did not even bother to take him to the border. Now he begs quarters at the airport and waits for the United States Government (i.e. the Republican Party) to rescue him. But Karl Rove and Dick Cheney (father of the daughter that Keyes likes to yell about) have something in mind for the somewhat brave Mr. Keyes: by this time next year they hope that he will be Senator from Iran.	2004-11-16

The King and the Duke wound up getting tarred and feathered, ridden on a rail.  <br />When's Lahaye going to get shown up for what he is?

Need to pay the AIR FARE back to Maryland from Illinois. The Negroes of Illinois were not impressed with this OLD TIME NEGRO recently imported into the state by the Republican Party and voted instead for Barack Obama who does not shout so much about EVIL people and does not inquire about your REPRODUCTIVE PRACTICES all the time. The same proved true for other Illinoisans who already have a STEADY JOB in the state. Mr. Keyes is thinking about a job in the rejuvenated BUSH REGIME, perhaps playing the soldier in some part of the world which he CANNOT FIND ON THE MAP but in the meantime he DID NOT GET THE JOB HE SOUGHT as he was OBSTREPEROUS AND OFFENSIVE TO HIS PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS. SO, please buy this book - you do not have to READ EVERY WORD.	2004-11-04

At one time, Toledo was pretty representative of 2nd ranking cities in America, in architecture as in other ways. As anyone who lives there or has had the misfortune to visit it knows, it is now one of the grungiest cities in America, the geographic incarnation of obese, emphysemic, morose, ignorant America. Check out the downtown these days, and you'll see something reminiscent of Newark New Jersey at its nadir. Buildings crumbling, gang graffiti on the walls, junk in the streets, shabby library, the works. Good art museum, though, for some reason. <br />Check out this collection of postcards, you'll see that even a dump like Toledo once had a money grubbing middle class and a few hot shots that felt the need to thump their chest architecturally, and saw fit to do it in public rather than in a private dwelling, which seems to be the norm these days. <br />\\"Tempora mutantur, et Toledo mutantur in illis\\" [sed non renascit sicut Cleveland].	2004-09-25

Wm. Shakespeare, an enterprising businessmen of the stage, hired the multitudinous young genius Chr. Marlowe to translate these works into English. By some shady strategm, public knowledge of this work of antiquarian scholarship was prevented from transpiring to the ears of the public and posterity. One wonders how the great scholar of Cave Man Language actually met his early demise. <br />We know from all this, completely disregarded by the authors, that the Neanderthals were in truth every bit as intelligent as Cro-Magnon Man. Or at least Cave Man Jake was.	2004-09-24

The intersection of sexual behavior, LOCAL sociology and the conflict of norms between Podunk and the cosmopolis that has been characteristic of Greece for the last two or three generations, and all this described by a trained social scientist rather than a beach weeker or a sex tourist: how could you fail to have an interesting story? <br />By writing the book in a language that is spoken by no one. Kirtsoglou has written her book in one of the most unendurable mishmashes of postmodernist, postmarxist, englishacademiotic gibberish I've ever seen. I tried dipping into this screed in twenty different places and could never get more than two paragraphs before I grounded on the bizarre jargon that seemed crafted for the express sake of ugliness, if not incomprehensibility .  <br />If you routinely read stuff written in this argot, you may find it valuable as she certainly seems to have properly investigated her topic. If not, skip it and wait for it to be translated into standard English.	2004-09-17

Sacco is himself among the characters, treated objectively like the rest. This is a plain record of a visit to the territories occupied by Israel since their victory in the Six Day War. It is Sacco's intent, clearly, to portray the physical suffering and mental anguish suffered by all the participants. Among those participants are several Israelis. They are treated with just as much sympathy as the Palestinians. Those who claim that this book is \\"biased\\" have not read it or are themselves bigots of the sort that would embarrass millions of enlightened Israelis.  The reviewers of July 25th and May 13th 2004 are writing from an agenda no better than that of a Klansman or a Marxist. They watch American television, rather than reading books. Can you see any evidence that they read Sacco's book?	2004-09-01

No kidding, this is the kind of stuff you'll read in the book. There's some confusion about the author, though. \\"Harold\\" is apparently the daddy, no doubt the personage whose autodidact goodness is portrayed in the lines above. Yet press reports (available at the book's website) claim that this business is actually written by his daughters, one of whom has a name beginning with \\"E\\", and one of whom has a name beginning with \\"C\\", yielding the \\"pen name\\" \\"E.C.Miller\\". Now who is it? Did daddy or his dutiful daughters pen this pensive pap? Which? Is this an example of what old-fangled family-valued Anglo American Christianity can do to youngsters' minds, or to an adult's?	2004-08-13

I was able to finagle the business and cajole my parents into leaving everything either to me alone or at least with my hooks in it. Seven children and seventeen grandchildren, all scheming and backbiting to get as much as possible and fritter it away. I had to get some sort of help to get me past the family values claptrap. I mean, how are you going to do your patriotic duty to the economy and keep estates intact and working for the profit of a few? What's the point of protecting inheritances from taxes if they're just going to be sawed up into a million pieces?	2004-07-24
