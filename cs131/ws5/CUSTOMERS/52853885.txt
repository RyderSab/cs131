For This Heart of Mine, I re-read Nobody's Baby But Mine and It Had To Be You to re-aquaint myself with Kevin and Molly. I had a great time with both books, re-affirming my long-ago decision to put these two books in my 'keeper box.' <BR>So I had high, perhaps unrealistic expectations for \\"This Heart of Mine,\\" following in the footsteps of two great SEP comedy-romances. I was pleased with Molly--being a quirky children's book author made perfect sense for her, and made for some great, humorous lines. I agree with other reviewers, though, that Kevin was a disappointment; so much time was spent describing his muscles, and so little time spent on his internal motivations, that she could have inserted a cut-out of a Calvin Klein underwear model to the same effect.<BR>Molly's tragedy is handled sensitively, and she is allowed a generous amount of book time to recover, but Kevin's turn-around from his own personal upheaval seems to happen in the blink of an eye. We never know why he is suddenly plunged into life-threatening activities, only that he is happy he finally found someone to share them with. I never felt I understood him. Given SEP's great track record as far as describing her male characters' thoughts, desires, and motivations, I can only assume that she didn't know what to make of Kevin, either.<BR>So while I would most heartily recommend Nobody's Baby But Mine, It Had to Be You, and even Heaven, Texas (although it was a little 'over the top' for me), This Heart of Mine is a borrower, not a keeper.	2002-07-15
US	52853885	R1M2A3EC4RISBX	0515128007	824641136	The Morning After	Books	1	6	6	N	N	Strong premise - but an unreadable book	I picked up this book because the opening premise sounded like a winner--a woman wakes up in a swanky hotel room, all evidence pointing to a romantic wedding night, but she can't remember a thing. A great start, but Ms. Forster bungles this from the get-go with implausible plot twist on top of sorry cliche on top of irritating coincidence.<br />As other reviewers have noted, the romance is next to nonexistent--just about the steamiest scene is between the heroine and herself--and so the book relies on &quot;Outbreak&quot;-style suspense for it's energy. Unfortunately, the plot has holes the size of a Buick, and the ending was pure, unbelievable hokum; a man completely manipulates a woman's life--creating jobs, friends, isolating her in a remote location and messing with her mind, and making her pregnant--and in the end she forgives him everything. Sheesh! A very disappointing read from a fairly good writer.	2002-03-10

Bowen's Evan Evans series certainly fits this bill, but with \\"Evan Can Wait\\" the series moves into deeper, more interesting waters.  <br />As usual, this book finds Evan Evans at home in Llanfair, an underappreciated sleuth whose fellow citizens are as colorful--and as hard to get to know--as the mountainous terrain. As usual, outsiders descend upon the town to wreak various sorts of havoc and get one of their number murdered. <br />But the mystery in \\"Evan Can Wait\\" takes a very satisying turn--we learn a great deal about Bronwen, the town schoolteacher who has been such a good-girl cipher up to this point, and we learn more about some of the darker parts of recent Welsh history, such as the life of a typical slate miner. Not only is there a recent murder to solve, but the murder has links to a decades-old crime and the two are tied together in a satisfying fashion at the end.<br />In short, it is still a light, amusing read, but with a little more depth to make the characters more real, the situations more complex, the ending a little more nuanced.	2002-03-08
US	52853885	R25UI7HTOUHMR1	1551668874	923301610	Heartbreaker	Books	3	4	5	N	Y	Some reprints are keepers - not this one	Early Linda Howard novels all share some similar characteristics:<br />heroes who are overwhelmingly strong, chauvinistic, opinionated, immovable, -- walking bundles of testosterone<br />heroines who are pretty, helpless, dithering, fearful, confused, yet somehow able to appeal to and interest the hero<br />a borderline nutcase (or not so borderline) or other villian intent on inflicting Great Bodily Harm, from which only the hero is truly capable of protection.<br />Sometimes this formula works pretty well- other times you aren't really sure if the heroine isn't just transferring from one sort of nutcase to another. Heartbreaker falls sort of in the middle; it's not a real wall-banger, like Loving Evangeline, but it's not as successful as Diamond Bay or White Lies. The problem is both with the heroine, who is a dithering, needy mess, even though she is a jet-setter with a &quot;minor in Business Administration&quot; (!), and the hero, who is on the knife-edge between possessive and obsessive. <br />I could easily see the heroine lapsing into the same sort of relationship she had with her first husband, so I had a hard time believing in the happily-ever-after. In order for a Linda Howard book to really work for me, the heroine has to have a core of inner strength to offset the Neanderthal tendencies of the hero--Grace in Son of the Morning is a good example. This book just didn't have that balance.	2002-03-07

The book is a series of letters, most of them from one sister to another, who are separated when the younger sister marries and moves to an isolated farm in Iowa. The younger sister, only 16, writes the sort of callow, self-centered and judgemental letters that only a sheltered 16-year-old could write, but she has a kind heart and a good brain, and it is a true joy to watch her learn the sometimes painful lessons of adulthood, especially in the trying times of the Civil War. The characters were all so real, so well-defined and true that it was almost impossible not to think of them as real people, and to think about them long after I completed the book.<br />I recommend this book for quilters, for readers of women's fiction, and for anyone who enjoys Oprah's picks but who also likes a novel that ends on a positive note.	2001-08-20

The story is told in several layers, the first part being a straight narrative of the search for, arrest of, and trial of the abductor, the second being a choppy series of first-person vignettes in only rough chronological order. McDermid is a talented writer who manages to hold all of these threads together (even a sappy re-created letter) but she is not talented enough to overcome the basic thinness of the story. <br />A girl disappears, and she is not found. A story is built around her disappearance. A trial results from this story. Years later, new information comes to light about this story. That is the entire plot, decorated by well-meaning (or not) but not very complex characters, enough coincidences to fill a Victorian melodrama, and a shocking, surprise ending that I saw a mile away. Anyone familiar with Sherlock Holmes' favorite saying will have this mystery figured out by the time they are 2/3 of the way through. And the trial, which was basically a retread of the previous 200-page narrative shouted by annoying barristers, was a bore.<br />I read it, because I felt it was my duty considering how highly regarded this book is. But I do not feel that all of these high accolades are deserved.	2001-08-15

Both Lillian and Gabe have money, success, and no lack of interest in the opposite sex, but drift together like two lost souls all the same.<br />It is easy to see why; a more cold, repressed, introverted pair have yet to have a novel written around them. This couple is so uncommunicative that their marriage proposal is done almost by mental telepathy. There are some funny lines, and these people certainly are written true and believable--but why should we care? They were both as chilly and distant as the frequent drenching storms off the Oregon coast, and just as welcoming and easy to know. <br />I read the book, and Krentz had her usual writing chops up to speed so it was easy and pleasant to read, but it still left me with an empty feeling--I'd read about these people, but I really didn't want to know them. The ending especially crumbled, as the weak central characters were unable to support it. Gabe and Lillian might be fine people, but together they were a black hole, sucking all the energy out of the story, no matter how many pairs of red bikini underwear, iridescent rain slickers, and striped silk ties were thrown into it.	2001-07-22

Andrews' second mystery bears some resemblance to her first--Meg and Michael still can't get any time alone, Meg is still put upon by all and sundry, and she again does her sleuthing in fits, starts, and stumbles. As in the first book, the mystery is fairly easy to solve, but it's a fun trip to get there. Some readers prefer the first book, which had more slapstick, manic humor and a faster pace, but I prefer Puffins. <br />Murder with Puffins moves at a slower pace, its humor more gentle but also a lot more realistic, and the characters also become more fleshed-out, less stereotypical. The exploration of Meg's parent's relationship, in particular, makes this book a deeper, more realistic read. I look forward to the next book in the series, as this may be one of those rare, treasured mystery series that actually allows the characters to grow, change, and become more complex and interesting.	2001-07-15

Publisher's everywhere have somehow decided that readers cannot keep their attention on a romance if it runs over 350 pages. For some stories, this arbitrary stopping point works OK, but this is one of those stories where page 350 comes like a slap in the face. <br />Up to the final chapters, it's a roaring good tale:  a ne'er-do-well, mysterious hero, a repressed, highborn spinster gambling for very high stakes, an unsolved murder. Lady Gabriella must make her way through society, find a husband for her achingly eligible sister, and keep some very important information completely under wraps, all by the side of a charming rogue who alternately helps and hinders.<br />Then, with the quickness of lightning, the villian is exposed, the plot twists neatly unravelled, and everyone lives happily ever after. Not only is this ending rushed in the extreme, but it leaves all sorts of unanswered questions. I can only hope that book 2, the middle sister's story, clears up some of my questions--but that in turn will deprive this poor dear of her measely share of pages (I'm sorry dear, but we need another fifty pages for your sister; you have been demoted to a novella...). In short, a great story, seemingly cut off at the knees.	2001-07-10

A championship archer on the lam from her family? A drunken tycoon escaping from an enraged bride? Leave it to Ivory to whip them together, strand them on the moor, make the plot turn around a flapping pair of red longjohns--and make it all believable, and touching.  A fabulous book, one to keep you up way past your bedtime and make you smile and remember a certain scene or two, days later.<br />I have one major issue with the book, and that is the modern morality inserted, sometimes jarringly, in a story set at the height of the Victorian age. The heroine accepts pre- and extramarital sex, homosexuality, and illegitimate birth with a cheerful carelessness that feels like Ally McBeal, not Victorian virgin. Especially considering how snobbish and tradition-bound the lady is in other areas, this does not ring true. If you can overlook this slight pull out of the time and place of the story, you will have an unmitigated great time with this book;  even with the above flaw, I still give it five stars, because the style, the inventiveness, and the sheer heart in the story deserve it.	2001-04-27
US	52853885	R2HCEY20LE9K9S	1581820089	141601899	Manassas (The Civil War Battle Series, Book 1)	Books	1	26	31	N	N	The Worst &quot;Civil War&quot; Book I Have Ever Read	The Civil War era is a gold mine for the novelist--everywhere you look there is tragedy, family strife, vicious politics, overturned lives, burned cities, collapsed civilizations. <br />I was amazed, then, to read such a leaden, uninteresting novel, filled with cardboard characters, pointless actions, unbelievable motives. Mr. Reasoner sifted through the colorful pageant of the Civil War, and came up with a novel reminiscent of a B-movie Western. With the dull, single-minded black/hats white/hats roaming this countryside, I expected Tom Mix to come over the ridge at any moment. The female characters, just like in bad Westerns, are especially stereotyped. The family matriarch, for example, is a religious zealot who loves her family but suddenly, arbitrarily decides to disown her eldest son. None of her children can figure out why she would do this, and neither can the reader--except that it moves the lead-footed plot forward another notch, forcing a character out of a posse (at last!) and into the battle.<br />The Southern viewpoint espoused in this novel reminds me of the Shirley Temple movie, &quot;The Little Colonel,&quot; for the fervent (very fervent!) simplicity of the viewpoint and rosy, selective view of slavery. Virginians are Good, Abolitionists are Bad, even though, of course, the Really Good Virginians don't happen to own any slaves. In fact, the author is careful to make sure that none of the &quot;heroes&quot; in this novel are or ever have been slaveowners; thus any uncomfortable soul-searching on the part of a reader (are these really the good guys?) is avoided. Any other aspects of the North/South political conflict, such as immigration, the division of federal spending, and the wider issues of states' rights, which had as much if not more importance in 1860-1861, are brushed aside in favor of a sensationalist story about honest farmers and the froth-at-the-mouth abolitionists who harass them.<br />When our heroes at last rode off into the sunset, Iwas glad they were leaving, and glad I wasn't forced to follow them on their next adventure. If you are truly interested in Civil War-era drama, look to &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; &quot;A Faded Coat of Blue,&quot; &quot;The Black Flower,&quot; or &quot;By Blood Posessed.&quot; &quot;Manassas&quot; is poor history, and fluffy writing.	2001-01-02

Instead of, for example, a novel addressing what life would have been like if the South won the Civil War, &quot;Grant Speaks&quot; poses the question, 'What would Grant's memoirs have been like if he was an impostor following a vision received while he was high on mushrooms in Mexico?'<br />Some people will have a hard time with this book--if they don't like their history varnished and decorated, if they don't like 'great men' shown, literally, with their drawers down--then this book will not please. If, on the other hand, you have in some small corner of your mind longed for someone to come right out and call George Armstrong Custer a &quot;little foppish yellow dog&quot; and Halleck a &quot;fatuous, double-dealing, conniving louse,&quot; then this book will be a welcome, albeit guilty pleasure. I enjoyed new twists on Lincoln, Lee, and Sherman. I laughed out loud at Grant's brutally honest assessment--as presented in the novel--of the deficiencies of the Army of the Potomac, and I actually thought his depiction of the character of Lee made sense, with reasonable explanations of the man's sometimes difficult-to-explain actions. <br />&quot;Grant Speaks&quot; is proof that fiction has it's own advantages--it can dance around literal truth, entertaining and amusing--and perhaps revealing larger, more universal truths.	2000-11-03

Julia Ross's My Dark Prince opens with a tall, dark, handsome and inscrutable hero dashing across the moors to a castle in ruins, where he abducts an innocent, ignorant girl. Hark! It's the Devil's Prince! And his princess has been abducted! I almost put the book down, thinking it must be some parody of romance novels of times gone by. But I soldiered on, and was rewarded--after the stilted beginning, we find that the heroine is a grimy-nailed collector of hedgehogs and is not so innocent after all, and that our seemingly amoral and bullying hero is covering up some pretty frightening cracks in his armor. The villian is also more than a  mustache-twirling stereotype, although his flaws have been used in fiction so often that they are becoming a stereotype of their own.<br />The hero is prince of a tiny Alpine country, buffeted about by its larger neighbors, France and the Austro-Hungarian Empire and fought over at the end of the Napoleanic wars. Its dilemma is quite believable, as it matches the history of many of the other small German principalities of that time. So, historically and in terms of characterization, the story is believable, but it constantly hovers on a knife-edge of fantastic plot turns, high emotion, and poetic language that almost plunges it into the realm of purple prose--or parody.<br />It is saved--again and again!--by the sheer writing talent of the author. In the end, instead of putting it down, I mulled over it far into the early hours. Was it a well-meaning, honest effort that just got out of hand, or was it a subtle poke-in-the-ribs about the sometimes florid nature of historical romances? I'm still not sure.	2000-10-23

Tim Cockey's The Hearse You Came In On has some fabulous things going for  it--great dialog, great one-liners, quirky and lovable characters  (especially the achingly earnest mortician-hero), and a tie-in with Our  Town that actually works into a plot point--that make it a fun, fast,  pleasant read. But it does have some of the deficiencies you might expect  in a first effort;  for one, character cliches abound, which made it easy  to unravel most of the puzzle, and for another, the pacing was a bit slow  in the beginning and almost frenetic at the end. But these are small  quibbles--go ahead, take a little trip to Baltimore and meet the folks,  both below and above ground. You won't regret it.	2000-09-14

The photographer, Shea Waterston, connects with a Denver  judge, Cameron Galliimard, and the novel follows the rocky course of their  relationship as they continually peel back the veneer of the present and  wrestle with the phantoms from their pasts.<br />The characters are  well-rounded, multi-dimensional, and believable. The descriptions are  fascinating, informative, and painlessly reveal what must be weeks of  painstaking historical research. Some scenes--the hanging, the midnight  intruder, the love scenes--are just pearls of fabulous writing.<br />So why  wasn't this a &quot;keeper&quot;? The characters were so believable, and  the settings so sharp and meticulous, that a series of incredible  coincidences jolted me right out of the story. I could certainly accept one  coincidence, but three? four? A few of the plot threads needed less  fantastic endings for the story to hold up. By the end, I was almost  expecting the photographer's assistant to turn out to be Shea's long-lost  brother. If you find such coincidences endearing, then you will adore this  book.	2000-09-04

It is a tough assignment  for anybody, so the reader should be prepared to cut our heroine a little  slack.<br />And a little slack is definitely needed--the heroine, Laura  Truitt, is certainly plucky and determined, but she is also crude, rude,  and with frequent bouts of obliviousness and stupidity. One scene, where  she repays one woman's slight rudeness with an extensive comeback on the  piano, and then tricks the woman into propositioning a cook in front of a  roomful of important houseguests--bordered on the cruel. Everyone likes a  little payback, but like many things with this headstrong heroine, she took  it way too far. At another point, she is so clueless she needs a ghost to  point her in a very obvious direction. She also keeps information from the  supposed love of her life for way too long to be believable--trust is  non-existent in this relationship, which made the romance one of the weaker  elements in the novel.<br />So read this book for a fun, fast-paced plot, and  some accurate history, and an interesting paranormal premise. Recommended  for those who don't mind flawed characters, a flawed romance, and a  villianess who--I kid you not--comes complete with her own black cloud,  which she carries around with her from place to place. Very convenient.	2000-09-04

I read it in a day because I just could not bear to put it down.  By Arrangement has everything you could want in a  historical novel--<br />a couple, David and Christiana, thrown together by  politics, held together by attraction, and slowly realizing their love,<br />a  historical background that is alive with sights, sounds, and realistic,  character-accurate behaviors, but never bogged down in detail or  description,<br />characters that have depth, believable emotions, interesting  ambitions, and that show contradictions, growth, and humor. I especially  liked how Christiana's discovery of the true nature of love was handled,  with an accumulation of everyday situations, each one handing her another  piece of the puzzle until the whole, shattering picture was revealed. Even  the &quot;villians&quot; were not cardboard cut-outs, but had believable  motivations and pasts that explained their current behaviors.<br />In short,  it is a masterfully crafted novel, and I can't wait to buy the next in the  series.	2000-07-31

I slogged through the first six chapters, then skimmed the rest. I found both lead characters just  incredibly dull. They were so repressed, every emotion seemed buried under  a thick woolen sweater. The heroine spent most of her time cooking and  hanging out laundry. The hero wrote things he didn't want anyone else to  look at. Even their lovemaking was subdued and furtive, a struggle under  the blankets and then quick smooth things down so no one else will notice.  I would say they weren't only born in ice, but they stayed that way, too. I  ended up skimming the book because these characters, and their tenuous  story, just could not interest me;  I found it a very realistic portrayal  of some very uninteresting people. Rabid Roberts fans will of course not  agree, but I didn't care for it.	2000-06-21

Two things, though, were enough for me to  lop off some stars in my rating.  <br />I took off one star for the irritating  practice of mentioning an event several times throughout the book--in this  case, a &quot;hot&quot; date between Benni's best friend and her  cousin--and then having the event happen sometime out of the time frame of  the book. Unfair, annoying, and unnecessary, near as I can tell. <br />I took  off another star because a young photographer gave Bennie an album of her  pictures on page 13. When the photographer is subsequently killed, I  waited--and waited--and waited--for her to finally remember the album and  look at it. It's one of those times when you want to shout at the character  for being such a numbskull. On page 289, I could finally rest easy. I love  San Celine; I think its inhabitants are a lot of fun, so much so that I  resented being tripped up by the author and reminded that this is, after  all, a manufactured story.	2000-06-12

For example: &quot;The ceilings were open, the rafters  exposed, and many was the Saturday night when the music was loud enough  that those rafters shook. The floor was scarred from the boots of men, the  scrape of chair and stool...&quot; One or two sentences of this is fine,  but an entire paperback of it is enough to turn me green as a shamrock. I  know some people are enchanted with flowery language--Kathleen Woodiwiss  has a loyal following--but I find it distances me from the story, making it  too charming, too contrived, and too syrupy to slog through.<br />If the  characters were new and inventive, it might make an interesting contrast  with the language, but instead we have a hero right out of John Wayne's The  Quiet Man and a heroine straight from several other Roberts novels. For  those who read this and are ready to buy their own flowery cottage by the  sea--please remember that this is, partly, a fairy story.	2000-06-01

US	52853885	R17QWJBBCVZVLP	0449149676	542957512	On Mystic Lake: A Novel	Books	2	23	30	N	N	Poorly-researched, throwback to another age--a triumph?	I truly looked forward to reading this book, my first Kristin Hannah and one that has received rave reviews. On Mystic Lake is the story of a woman who, cruelly abandoned by her husband, goes back to her home town to  &quot;find herself.&quot; The premise was great, but my disappointment in  the story grew as I read page after page. <br />From the beginning, I was  frustrated with the heroine, Annie. How could she be so clueless about her  husband? Didn't she have any sort of life for herself, outside of her  daughter and picking up her husband's dry cleaning? As a stay-at-home mom  myself, I found her doormat attitude about life downright insulting. What  on earth did she do with herself day after day, while they were away at  work and school? She seemed child-like in her isolation, her lack of  interests, her total definition of herself as a wife and a mother. <br />I  hung on, through the untrue depictions of Malibu and LA, through the  flowery, almost purple descriptions of Mystic, hoping she would figure out  who she was... well, it turns out, she is a &quot;wife&quot; and a  &quot;mother&quot;! She finds an old beau on the skids and his troubled  daughter, and so becomes his surrogate wife and dear little Izzy's new and  improved mother. We are supposed to cheer for her, because she helps  frightened Izzy and tortured Nick become better people, and she feels good  about it. But do we really learn anything new about her? Does she learn  anything new about herself, beyond her sex drive? I don't see it. She has  vague plans about opening a bookstore. Once, she wanted to be a writer, but  that idea is also taken nowhere. She blames this on her father, who never  taught her to have goals of her own.<br />The final straw, for me, was the  arrival of her pre-term daughter. Anyone who has spent any time in a modern  NICU will roll their eyes at the inaccuracies. A five-pounder in mortal  danger? Not these days. Annie's rivers of tears are downright annoying to  anyonewho has seen the brave, stoic parents of those babies truly at risk.  Annie would not have been allowed to wring her hands at her daughter's side  for days on end, and the instantaneous nursing scene was almost laughingly  unrealistic. In retrospect, I would say this plot turn was egregiously  manipulative, designed for everyone to get out their hankies one more  time.<br />While Annie is a truly noble person, who is a fabulous mother and  certainly an attentive, efficient wife, I did not find her heroine material  because I did not see new dimensions of her personality revealed, I did not  see her moving in new directions. And, frankly, I felt insulted by  inaccuracies of detail and a plot obviously designed to wring the  heartstrings as effectively as a Hallmark commercial. I like Hallmark  commercials; but I was expecting more.	2000-05-26

I am one of those people who never pays any attention to &quot;category&quot; romances - just breeze right by them--so this book was my first exposure to Ruth Wind. Boy, have I been missing out! She is a  fabulous writer, with the ability to wrap a location around you, people it  with believable characters, and even give you a sound track to go with it.  I devoured this book in two days, with the house practically falling down  around me, but I couldn't stop until I had all the answers. I loved the  characters--small town, but not cliches or caricatures, and I loved Pine  Bend, with it's heat and its food, it's sorrows and its secrets. I can't  get enough of Pine Bend, and I can't get enough of Ruth Wind. Anyone who is  getting tired of romantic suspense, or who wants something a little more  in-depth and darker-edged than Krentz or Roberts, look no further.	2000-05-26
US	52853885	R35M8S4TVV5REI	1551665921	135146320	Hostage	Books	4	48	51	N	N	A wonderful sense of place	The Hostage, the first of a planned trio of stories about a group of girlfriends in 1870's Chicago, tells the story of Deborah Sinclair, a pampered, yet wounded, financier's daughter who is taken hostage by Tom  Silver, a man bent on revenge against her father for a mining disaster. Tom  forces Deborah away from her home on the night of the great Chicago fire,  taking her to beautiful, yet primitive and remote Isle Royale, a large  island off the spectacular Lake Superior coast of upper Michigan.<br />Having  grown up in Michigan, with several trips a year to Chicago, I was able to  enjoy this book on several levels. First off, it is a wonderful character  study: we get to see two wounded people, narrowed to one-dimensionality by  environment and circumstance, blossom into fully aware, realized people who  not only discover romance and conquer their fears of intimacy, but also who  discover themselves, and learn to resolve their personal tragedies.  Secondly, I thoroughly enjoyed the &quot;minor players&quot; - namely,  Chicago and Isle Royale/Lake Superior. Each place is, in its own way,  stunning, majestic, powerful, and sometimes cruel. It made me homesick, and  reminded me of my own families' stories of &quot;the great  fire.&quot;<br />This story is not for those looking for a quick read with  instant gratification--we are there for each small step on Tom and  Deborah's roads to recovery. The romance, and the healing, grows slowly,  and the ending is perhaps a little too swift given such a long buildup. But  this is a minor flaw in a tale that is both grand and also intimate. The  book does, definitely, reward a patient reading.	2000-05-22
US	52853885	R3RYDFNPVYL722	042517428X	983788058	The Burning Point	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A powerhouse contemporary novel from a master craftswoman--	Do you like Mary Jo Putney's historical novels? Then you are in for a treat. Do you prefer contemporary or women's fiction? Then you are in for a treat. Ms. Putney is known for writing characters with depth and  complexity, characters with very real issues, flaws, and problems to  overcome, such as alcoholism or degenerative illness. In The Burning Point,  she blends this talent with a contemporary setting, a fascinating current  technology, and modern problem-solving techniques to create a riveting,  emotionally satisfying read.<br />In The Burning Point, a woman comes to grips  with an intense, abusive relationship and helps mend a family fractured by  death and divisiveness. But Ms. Putney never gives us cardboard characters,  either all good or all bad. Each character must face their weaknesses and  find the inner strength to overcome them. This process is fascinating; you  feel, understand and empathize with their desire to 'do the right thing'  and also to grow and fulfill their potential as completely as possible. For  example, rather than present the abuser as a cliched villian, Ms. Putney  brings us inside him, to see (in flashbacks) his horror during his growing  realization of his problem, his acceptance (including therapy, support  groups, and radical lifestyle changes) and his continuing struggles with  feelings of guilt, self-disgust, and hopelessness.<br />Seeing an issue from  the inside out brings new possibilities and new insight. While this novel  has romance, and a large extended family of characters, each character must  privately accept and vanquish his or her own demons, finding their own path  of truth and justice in a morally ambiguous world. In The Burning Point,  abuse victims can see to their own healing, but they are never responsible  for the redemption of the abuser. Can family rifts be healed, even after a  decade of silence? Can an abuser recover, or is he or she a lost cause? Is  there even room in the modern world for such notionsas redemption and  forgiveness? Ms. Putney gives us a hopeful 'yes', and I was left with a  sense of satisfaction and promise, as well as a set of characters that I  will not soon forget.	2000-05-08

The women in this novel  are so well-written, so multi-dimensional, you feel as if you've known them  for a long time. Each of them has strengths and weaknesses, enjoys grand  sucesses and suffers indignities large and small; but what is especially  well done is we see how their problems result not only from outside sources  but from their own personal faults and idiosyncracies, and this makes the  solutions they struggle to find so much more real and riveting. Although  the women in this book are all, to a greater or lesser extent, sucessful  writers, their story is something anyone can relate to. I recommend this  book to all my friends--as an opportunity to make some new, literary ones.	2000-04-21

A story of redemption, about how people can grow and change even when they feel their life is at a standstill, this was an absolutely marvelous read, a definite keeper. All the characters were very believable, an intruiging  mix of good and bad, and their struggle for growth and meaning in their  lives made you root for them every step of the way. I especially like the  realism in the situations they faced, and the fact that not every conflict  was neatly vanquished and tucked away. There are things these people will  still struggle with, but the faith and love they share as a family will see  them through. It reminded me a bit of Summer's End, by Kathleen Seidel,  another good book about families.	2000-04-10

Her doting husband tells her to take a lover, since he is incapable. After a few half-hearted protestations she  does so, and so starts this soap opera that supposedly takes place in  Regency England. It features a divorced hero (he and his ex-wife are still,  unbelieveably, seen about in society) who had a daughter named Chelsea  (Chelsea?) and a typically froth-at-the-mouth villian out to stab, burn,  ravish, and stab our poor heroine (in that order). The poor old duke is  conveniently done away with, the marriage of convenience inevitably occurs,  and the heroine is stupid enough to believe what the ex-wife decides to  tell her. Despite the plot, the writing is good, although a bit flowery. If  you like soap opera, aren't fussy about historical details, like your  heroines sweet and blonde and your heroes dark and brooding, then you  should enjoy this.	2000-03-30

While the hero and heroine were,indeed, bona-fide lab-coat-wearing scientist-types, don't read this book expecting to learn something new about artificial intelligence or robotics--or even plastics, for that matter. Our intrepid couple are as reality-based as the absent-minded professor. That aside, the story was cute, with the misconceptions (of otherwise very clever people) ripped away in a satisfying manner. The only thing I found a bit icky was a character being massaged and otherwise 'serviced' by a robot. Granted, this was only mentioned in passing (sorry, no interesting salacious details) but I still felt some moral twinges. If it's a robot, is it sexual harassment? Is it fair to create artificial life for use as a toy? Do androids dream of electric sheep?	2000-03-30

Barbara Delinsky's  Within Reach, of course. Just like Within Reach, our intrepid heroine  escapes the confines of her restricted political life, all without  revealing any messy details about her husband's private life. But, since  this is the 00's, not the 80's, our heroine ends up in office, not a happy  housewife, and there are problem children to take care of instead of  indictments. Granted, the problem children are realistically cute and  annoying, but the ending is over-the-top and cloying (would Andre really do  a black power salute? Would our hero really become Our Correspondent In The  White House? Not!).	2000-03-30

Was I in for a  disappointment! The hero, if you want to call him that, is a bone-headed  neanderthal who spent his years from age fourteen onward with a tribe of  Bedouins who taught him a) to survive in the desert and b) to believe women  were chattel, impossible to love. When he finally decides to return home to  his grieving, if scatterbrained, mother, he immediately selects his  children's governess as the woman for him, and so sets about socially  humiliating her and sexually molesting her until she is forced to marry  him. Even his mother calls him a &quot;jackass.&quot; This caveman carts  his new bride off to a tent after they are wed, rips her wedding clothes of  off her with a knife, and rapes her. Never fear, we are told she liked it.  As she wondered later, &quot;What kind of primitive creature lived in her  heart, craving his mastery?&quot; Indeed, I wonder, too. A psychotherapist  would have a field day with this crowd. The story line of workplace sexual  harassment circa 1830 is fleshed out with a supposed embezzling scheme and  the heroine's fruitless task of civilizing the hero. The embezzling angle  is wrapped up in less than a paragraph, and the &quot;civilizing&quot;  theme is very sketchy--on one hand, we are supposed to believe the hero is  a hot-blooded shiekh of the desert who somehow forgot everything he learned  prior to age fourteen, and on the other hand we are told he plays 'stupid  savage' just to be sure to get his own way. Finally, his children (!)  assure our dysfunctional hero that yes, indeed, he does love his bride.  Supposely a light bulb goes on over his head, and he is a Changed Man, yet  we are told once again that &quot;reluctant maidens should be  kidnapped.&quot; The only way to really enjoy this uncomfortable, illogical  tale is to take it as some sort of spoof of 1970's-era bodice-rippers, and  laugh off all of our hero's caveman behavior as if it were just a pie in  the face. Good Luck.o take it as some sort of spoof of 1970's-era bodice-rippers, and  laugh off all of our hero's caveman behavior as if it were just a pie in  the face. Good Luck.	2000-03-29

If you are sick and tired of reading about foreign  royalty, designer clothes, jaunts to Monte Carlo, and meaningless sex laden with tired metaphors, here is your antidote. Jenny Crusie writes about real people,  characters I could recognize right from the people in my home town, and yet  their story is told with such humor and sensitivity, such great  understanding of the dark and the light, that I was riveted.

Everyone knows SEP is a good writer, able to come up with interesting characters from wildly disparate backgrounds who somehow get together, but this book is not one of her greats. First off, it suffers what I consider an &quot;80's disease&quot; - a Sidney Sheldon/Judith Krentz - like  obsession with designer names, foreign princes, descriptions of yachts, and  lots of pre-AIDS catting around. Secondly, its characters are not all that  endearing: our heroine is obsessed with looks, money, and success, and our  hero is obsessed with bimbos and failure. He neglects to tell her he's  married;  she neglects to tell him she had his son. I had a hard time  liking these people, wondering if it was worth the effort to sort through  several relationships and lots of confusing flashbacks.

Meriel Grahame lost her parents in a horrifying  encounter that left her stranded from her family, her culture, and even her  ability to communicate. Her slow return to the world is brought about by  the power and support of those who love her, especially Dominic Renbourne.  Dominic, who suffers from his own nightmares of the past and estrangement  from those he loves, slowly develops a special rapport with Meriel that not  only helps her to recovery but also gives him a renewed sense of purpose  and the strength and insight to once again connect with his family and  renew his special bond with his twin. The Wild Child is filled with  memorable characters, large and small, each crafted with Putney's fine  sense of detail and humor. For those of you who are already Putney fans,  there is a return of Kenneth and Rebecca from &quot;River of Fire&quot;  as  well as echoes from the past of &quot;Uncommon Vows&quot;--you don't have  to have read these stories to appreciate The Wild Child, but they do add  another special layer of resonance.  I can't recommend this book  enough--you come away from The Wild Child not just entertained by a  terrific love story, but with renewed sense of the healing power of love.	1999-06-16
