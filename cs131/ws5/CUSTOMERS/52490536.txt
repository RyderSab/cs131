The photographs of children expressing their emotions are very appealing and since each page features a new face with an up-close image, as well as additional smaller shots, there are no distractions to take away from the emotion being taught.  Here's what's included:  Happy, Sad, Angry, Shy, Sleepy, Messy, and Silly.  Sturdy, good sized board book with overlapped pages and easy to find tabs to point out each emotion.	2005-09-14

On the last page, she always whispers, \\"Good night, Elmo, I love you,\\" which is how we always say goodnight.<br /><br />Though it has very few pages and simple one sentence text, not much more is needed at this age to engage your child's interest and get the message across in a way they can understand.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  I also suggest TOO BIG FOR DIAPERS with Ernie as the star showing off his new potty training skills.	2005-08-17

The words on each page are short and simple, the pictures are very appropriate for youngsters who can relate to the different activities they encounter each day and how they can signal a grown up that they need to use the bathroom.  The steps are so matter of fact that it makes potty training seem as simple as 1-2-3!<br /><br />I like that this is a sturdy board book so it withstands daily reading for both our kids.  Very well worth the price.	2005-08-08

Ms. Shriver has succeeded in putting all the sensitive feelings and thoughts that naturally occur when a loved ones develops Alzheimer's.<br /><br />Soft watercolor pictures accompany meaningful text to describe families from all backgrounds as they begin the long and sometimes painful journey with seniors as their memories fade, they repeat themselves, can't remember things, and ask the same questions over and over.<br /><br />Meant for older children, this book is a wonderful starting point to begin discussions of this topic with classes and/or your children at home.<br /><br />So thorough is the coverage in this book that it even includes a wealth of additional resources in the back pages with websites and 800 #'s for further information on Alzheimer's education and aging.	2005-08-05

This book is by far the only one that has withstood the test of time in our library.  It is colorful and the photos of babies and toddlers playfully interacting with puppies of all sizes are just precious.  Unlike other baby books, this one hasn't been tossed aside and forgotten.

She misses her father, who was brutally murdered when she was just a small child, and she finds it difficult to do well in school, make more than one true friend, stay out of trouble at home.  Emma is her only salvation, her only guts and defense in a cruel and heartless existence.<br /><br />I can't say much more for fear of ruining the story.  Suffice to say you will be mesmerized by the poignancy of this story, your heart will absolutely break for their suffering, and you will be torn between rooting for a happy ending and just wishing the pain would stop at whatever the cost.  There were chapters that left me shaking in sobs, I was so in pieces over the graphic abuse.  And reading it from a child's perspective is what made it all the more heart wrenching.<br /><br />You won't close this book with a smile on your face, rather, with a heavy heart.  It is tremendously hard-hitting and will stir your soul.	2005-05-08

Each page shows a familiar setting for baby -- high chair, napping, splashing in a pool, riding in a carriage, bathing in the tub, etc.  There is a slot or ribbon to fit the little stuffed infant into every scene on each page, making it lots of fun to tell a story to your little one as they try to put the baby inside.  Measures a nice 7.5\\"x8.5\\" so it's good for lap time reading and play.

Since Elmo can do no wrong in our house, this book seemed like a natural pick to help introduce manners to our fussy two year old who likes things her way.  She actually followed along when we read about teaching Cookie Monster to say please, but when it came to the part where Bert says, \\"How do you do?\\" to an octopus, I think it went over her head.  Obviously the idea of learning basic manners early on is a great one, I just think the book didn't hit the mark squarely enough so that young ones can apply what they see and hear to their everyday activities.  Better to have shown real life scenarios that a child can relate to when showing them how to behave politely.<br /><br />\\"Thank you\\" and \\"excuse me\\" are also covered, so it doesn't miss the mark completely.  And the large board book format is perfect for lap reading and rough little hands.	2005-04-10

Filled with scenes of the Sesame Street gang in familiar settings, your child will love hearing you read the simple rhymes on each page, i.e., \\"Bert loves pigeons, and pigeons love to coo.  Can you guess who Elmo loves?  Elmo loves you!\\"<br /><br />The story explains how everyone and everything loves something, from babies loving noise and toys, to penguins loving the snow.  The adorable pages will come to life and you'll find your child returning to this book just to pick out all their favorite things like Big Bird and Grover in the swimming pool, Ernie playing the drums, and other favorite characters shopping with Mommy in the grocery store.<br /><br />This book was mainly advertised in book stores for Valentine's Day, but it really is appropriate any time, teaching children about love all year round.	2005-04-03

It's all downhill from there.  I was misled into believing that there would actually be some different and UNIQUE phrases in here.  Being one to write out a greeting card to family and friends at least once a month, I sometimes could use a fresh expression or two.  I bought this book with the assumption that I'd find all that inside.<br /><br />Sorry to say, this book offers nothing by way of originality.  Do I really need someone to suggest writing these phrases in my greeting cards:  \\"Have a sensational birthday\\", \\"Have a wonderful birthday\\", \\"All the best to the best\\", \\"Just to keep you on your toes, I like to introduce you as my 1st husband...\\"  and more ridiculous wording such as that.<br /><br />I see that it must have just taken money to find a publisher to put this book on the shelves.  Talent and an ability to offer something new was not part of the mix here.  I could find more appropriate wording in a grammar school English paper.<br /><br />I hope I can at least sell my copy at a flea market for a buck.	2005-03-28

After reading and appreciating THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER years ago, I assumed I'd enjoy THE ONE MINUTE MOTHER now that I have two kids of my own.  WRONG!  The author's needless use of a silly story, very slow and unappealing, does little to nothing to enhance the principles of One Minute Parenting.<br /><br />The main three ideas are simple, they seem effective enough, and I'll definitely give them a try when my children are older (not really best suited for real youngsters).  THEY ARE:  1. Set and review goals regularly as a family; 2. Catch your kids doing something right and offer prompt praise; 3. Conversely, when kids are at fault, offer a short and succinct reprimand taking care not to scold the person, just their behavior.<br /><br />Dr. Johnson's characters, a mom to be, a One Minute Mother whom she is interviewing, and the One Minute Mother's children, sound like condescending stick figures in their dialogue and after a few pages you find yourself just wanting to turn to the final chapter to finish get it over with.<br /><br />The chart at the end of the story easily sums up what could have been said in a one page essay for a magazine -- this was a needless waste of publishing.

The colorful depictions of the animals are eye-catching, though I think Grover is a little one-dimensional and not nearly as cute as the actual photos of him in more realistic board books.  However, you will be able to teach your youngster lots of animal facts, such as what has fur and whiskers (cat) and what has long floppy ears and flops around on long legs (bunny rabbit).  The pages are set up so that your child can choose which animal correctly matches Grover's description, so you can also point out the various other animals once the correct one is chosen.  My favorite in this Sesame Street series is the Elmo's Guessing Game About Colors, though all four are cute and enjoyable while offering a fun way to teach.	2005-02-11

GETTING DRESSED! presents cute and colorful pages of Elmo in various stages of dressing himself.  It also shows the clothing appropriate for different seasons, i.e. snow boots in winter and bathing suit in summer.  Our child loves to point to all the clothes and mention their names, colors, and where they belong on the body.  The wording is very familiar if you watch ELMO'S WORLD on Sesame Street, and since there are no flaps like in some of the other Elmo's World board books, you won't have to worry about your little one ripping the doors off.  Lift the flap books are not our favorite, so we were glad this one didn't have them.  Add this to your child's book collection and it will soon become a favorite.	2005-02-11

Each page has a very short line about \\"why a daughter needs a mom...\\" i.e., \\"to read to her,\\" \\"who can play on her level,\\" \\"to listen closely to what troubles her,\\" etc. etc.<br /><br />I found nothing overly moving or memorable here, in fact, the black and white photographs accompanying each of the 100 Reasons do nothing to bring these pages to life.  Most photos are clearly contrived portraits of \\"everyday-type\\" models posing to reflect the sentiment on the page.  None of them look spontaneously photographed to capture a feeling or a moment.<br /><br />I'm assuming that the author, Gregory E. Lang, aimed at tearing at the heartstrings, but I'm not so sure it was accomplished here in that you'll find very little originality and even less to keep you turning the pages to read more.  By the time I got to Reason #100 (...because without her she will have less in her life than she deserves) we are pretty much bored and will think twice before giving this book as a gift.<br /><br />I'm both a mom AND a daughter, and I normally love these kinds of books, dedicated to capturing the feelings and sentiments behind family bonds, but this one just doesn't hit the mark.

We don't get the idea that this dangerous, unbelievable stunt was \\"okay\\" -- Philippe Petit did get arrested once he came down off the wire, however, we see his point of view, his affinity for the buildings, and how he perfected his skills before attempting this feat.  I recall, as a young child, when this story was in the news.  And when the towers fell on September 11, 2001, I watched this gentle Frenchman come to tears on the news during an interview, as he remembered walking between them.

She is a tough cookie to get to sleep, but we have now found a way that works every time.  She absolutely LOVES this book, she picks it out each night before we get her p.j.'s on and tuck her in, then we read it together (three or four times!) before she gets droopy-eyed and yawns herself to sleep.  I even find myself getting mesmerized by the repetition of verse and pictures on the colorful (yet easy on the eye) pages.  The story is simple, the characters few, but my daughter delights in picking out the tiny mouse on each page, in finding the red ballon, the clock, the kittens, mittens, and the bowl of mush.  I recommend the Lap Edition since it is nice and large; our little one looks as though she can step right into the \\"big green room\\" as I read to her on each giant page.  A must have for early childhood reading!	2004-05-22

Now that I have two little girls of my own, I love that this story is still around!  Lorna Balian has managed to create a character that is sweet and mischievous and endearing and by the end of the story, you will find yourself with a huge smile on your face!  I recall begging my mom to help me put all the special and kooky ingredients into a big pot in the kitchen to see if I could stir up some witches' brew!  I won't tell you if it worked, you'll just have to see for yourself!  &lt;wink wink>  Great illustrations go along with a memorable story.  A must-have for any kids' library.	2004-05-01

I'm a fan of squooshy bathtub books because my little ones, close in age, love to bath together and \\"read\\" to each other while we lather up.  This book is not only cute and colorful, but the story is lively and easy for little toddlers to love.  I recommend this and all the other Einstein Bath books for your wee ones!  They are just the right size for little hands, float perfectly on top of the bath bubbles, and hold up well to twists and tugs in the tub.  Enjoy!	2004-04-21

The film was a theatre experience for me, and I looked forward to the soundtrack, which we just purchased and love, and now this compilation of movie stills presented in full color in a generously sized coffee table book.  The photos take you through the entire film, with the exception of omitting the character of SATAN, which was, in my opinion, a pivotal force in this whole story, both historically and in the movie.  The viewer/reader should be made aware that at every point in Christ's Passion and death He was tempted by this demon and refused to succumb.  Incidentally, the androgenous role of Satan was played by an Italian female model, Rosalinda Celentano, with such convincing realism that I would find it hard to look at her in any other light.  It's a shame that this book neglected even one photograph of her, since her image was so powerful in the film.  You will find this photo essay quite bloody and graphic, just as in the film, but otherwise, it is a truly beautiful collection of movie scenes with a Foreward by director, Mel Gibson.	2004-04-14

This little Golden Book takes you back to that special time when cuddling up next to Mom and Dad for a story was the highlight of the day.  This beautiful story is from a father telling his little daughter how very much he is blessed to have her, just how much he loves her and how someday, though she will grow up and wear a wedding dress and leave him, he will always have her in his heart.  Any young child will love this book, the soft illustrations and meaningful verses.  Share this with your special little someone, it will become a treasured favorite.	2004-04-11

Shaped like Baby Woodstock, the 12 pages open up like you're unfolding Easter eggs as Snoopy and Woodstock paint their eggs in their favorite colors.  The text is simple and the bright colors are eye catching so your little ones will eagerly turn each page to see what the next egg will look like!  If your toddler is a biter like ours, watch out for the cardboard tail and hair on Woodstock since these pointy extremities seemed to be very \\"tasty\\" for our kids, but otherwise they will enjoy this little book as much as you'll love reading it to them.	2004-03-31

Not only does she ramble on incessantly about trivial nonsense, such as how she washed her hair in the airport bathroom before interviewing Yolanda Saldivar, but she never gets to the reason fans wanted to read her story -- WHAT IS THE SECRET?  She claims she promised Yolanda never to reveal it, however, she misleads the readers by her title and deceptive description of her story.  Ms Arraras better stick to her trash tv job, or go back to college writing 101, where she can actually form a sentence that does NOT include a self-serving piece of information or a non-important remark about inconsequential things.  She repeatedly toots her own horn, bragging about how she was the first to get inside to talk to Yolanda, how Selena's family grew to trust only her, how she worked so hard and so long to report the &quot;facts&quot;  -- what BALONEY!  One so-called &quot;fact&quot; she reported was that one attorney had huge fleks of dandruff in his hair!  WHO CARES?  These are the kinds of things this book talks about, nothing substantial, and certainly nothing that a true SELENA fan would care to waste time reading.  The book is more a rag piece on Saldivar, and the author obviously has an affinity for her as she attempts to tell a lopsided version of the story of this talented singer's tragic death.  Just save your money, PLEASE!	2003-09-17

I'm a first-time Fielding reader and will be back for more after this one.  The four female characters are richly developed, their lives spanning more than two decades where we are taken on an emotional rollercoaster filled with family drama, career angst, personal turmoil and ultimately a horrifying twist and subsequent resolution.  There is no way you will put this one down.  Chris, Barbara, Vicki and Susan will jump off the pages and if you are like me and enjoy unexpected story twists, you'll find yourself shocked and even crying before it's over.  A must read!	2003-08-09

Now that we've taken that maiden trip, are we glad we did!  The recipes in the book include every kind of yummy breakfast treat you can imagine. (The coconut and chocolate chip Peter Paul Pancakes are my fave!)  If you have the time and patience to fuss over breakfast and don't just want to grab an apple and cup of coffee as you race out the door, this is a great way to enjoy Breakfast as a main meal of the day, and treat your family to something special too.  The recipes are straightforward and easy to follow.  The author (who is also the restaurant owner)has a friendly and easy to read style and it makes the cookbook more than just a step by step instructional.  If you are ever in New York City, stop by this place on the Upper East Side and see for yourself why Carrie Levin has earned such a great reputation in her business.	2003-07-06

This book is so typical Seinfeld that even as you read each page you can hear his whiny tone and exageration in each line.  The accompanying CD is perfect to play along while you read, and the illustrations are on the money when it comes to capturing the essence of childhood \\"Halloween frustration.\\"  The cartoons look just like him! Jerry spoke to a generation on national television, making us laugh so hard we sometimes cried, and he continues to do so in syndication; now he tickles our funnybones in hardcover too, and our older kids will even enjoy the humor!  He tells his own childhood story of how he suffered through horrible homemade costumes and cheezy cheap candy from the neighbors, and what a dream his Superman costume was until the dreaded rubber band on the darned mask snapped and got too tight.  True stuff, very real and very funny!  This is a must have for any Seinfeld fan.	2003-06-11

A New Yorker all my life, I still cannot believe what happened that day, what my own eyes witnessed as the towering steel pillars crumbled to dust.  My children will ask me questions when they grow up about what we experienced on 9-11-01 and I know that the images will be as clear to me in the future as they were on that day.

This is one book I should have borrowed from the library...\\"Bridges\\" was one of a kind, turn-paging and heartfelt drama which I could not put down till I completed it.  \\"Country Roads...\\" is long and drawn out, boring, with no hooks whatsoever, nothing to make you want to keep reading through the end.

If it were not for the awesome cover shot of these steel phantoms, we would not have even a glimpse inside of the beauty that once was before September 11, 2001.  Having lived in New York City all my life, I witnessed these towers crumble, and I can't get my hands on enough stuff even remotely related to them, this is why I ordered this book.

She gives me very few highly recommended titles, but this one she had no doubt about --- BUY IT AND GET YOUR HILIGHTERS OUT!  It is a simply put, beautifully expressed vision of the ways in which love, romance, dreams of forever, and the challenges of partnerships are faced by women.  We tend to take on &quot;roles&quot; in our love lives, and Ms. Williamson captures the roles in such a way that you will find yourself within her words.  I was so engrossed with the very first half I could barely put it down.  It helps to know when you are reading that if your partner is willing to open up in the ways the book describes, you are both in for a wonderful journey into the spiritual side of love.  If only one of you is aware of the need for change, it will be a very different, if not somewhat empty, journey alone.	2001-06-30

I was amazed at his ease of telling a TRULY HEARTFELT account of a man's personal battle with the bulge.  It is never easy to watch someone struggle with their weight, but Van Whitfield's portrayal of these genuinely likeable characters makes you stand up and cheer for their success.  I laughed right out loud with some parts, and really enjoyed his unique story-telling style.  Keep up the DYNAMITE work, Mr. W.!!!

Of course seasoned  entrepeneurs will find the contents boring and irrelevant, (then again,  they're not the ones who should be reading it!) but to someone who has  never explored the area, this guide is a good starting point of reference.	2000-01-11
US	52490536	R1BDN2LH7DZ1XH	0394884663	387632886	The Snowman	Books	4	15	16	N	N	Magical	The simplicity of its message, the sweetness of the characters, the emotion of the story, all serve to make THE SNOWMAN a child's fantasy come true.  I'd recommend the video first, as the music makes the scenes come alive, but reading the book alone allows for the imagination to take off  with the little boy and journey with him through the snowy night.  Hopefully this book will become a modern-day children's classic.	2000-01-11

There is nothing ordinary about THE GREEN MILE and you won't put it down till the last breathless pages.<br />In a cold and lifeless place, Paul is the only Officer who can &quot;see&quot; what convicted child killer John Coffey sees.  His fellow guards trust and  respect Paul, but know that their jobs are at stake if they give in to  emotions.  The electric chair is the final seat for once hardened (but some  now softened) criminals, and it's all but impossible to keep your wits  about you in a cell block filled with sadistic officers like Percy and  psychopathic killers like Wild Bill.  But Paul will make you see things  differently, like J.C. (Jesus Christ perhaps? ) sees them.  Nothing will  look the same to you again.	2000-01-10
US	52490536	R6D8Y99EVK4IZ	0425147762	980393930	Red Azalea	Books	5	111	114	N	N	Tremendous	As required reading for a college course on Asian history, I picked up this book one night and finished it the next.  It is a heart-stoppingly real, rough and dramatic account of a young woman's ascent and descent in  the Red Army during Mao's reign in China.  At times I was moved to tears,  literally -- while commuting on a subway.  I was enthralled with the  author's &quot;voice&quot; in telling her own sad, victorious, heart  wrenching story from childhood through adulthood.  Red Azalea is an  important piece of writing which I'd recommend not only to students  interested in Chinese history, but to anyone who enjoys a real human story  with historical reality.	2000-01-04

It is crammed with words of wisdom, quick snip-its of advice, inside peeks in human nature, personal mantras to recite to yourself when the going gets  rough.  You won't want to read this one just once; rather, keep referring  to it whenever the right circumstance presents itself.  And don't loan it  to a colleague, for you might never get it back.  Buy them a copy of their  own!	2000-01-04

That when you walk a quiet stretch of beach you can almost HEAR the ocean whispering to you?  Opal Whitely was an extraordinary human being, both misunderstood and respected, though  unfortunately not as much until after her death.  This book was required  reading for a college Orality in Literature course and it set the stage for  the entire semester.  It is so thought-provoking, sensitive, forthright and  creative that you will not be able to put it down without somehow being  changed in the way you &quot;see&quot; &quot;feel&quot; and  &quot;hear&quot; the world around you.  There is so much to be learned.  Let Opal teach you.	2000-01-04

Being a life-long dog owner, I knew nothing about the feline's particular ways, habits, personalities, or even possible conditions or diseases.  I DO NOW!  This  book is a wealth of information, beautifully photographed, with every breed  imaginable.  A MUST HAVE for the cat lover/owner/admirer!	1999-12-26

I've referred to this book so often when watching old episodes that it's frayed on the edges!  It's a great source of info and helps viewers get more in depth with each show.  Also offers behind-the-scene tidbits of  interest to die hard fans.  I enjoyed the &quot;dictionary&quot; style  which lists each episode by title, making it easy to look up your favorite  shows.  For any Twilight Zone fan, this is a great addition to your  bookshelf.	1999-12-22

Their dialogue is never unbelievable, their love story is timeless.  You will fall for these lovers from the moment you begin the book.  I  especially loved the fact that it was told from the perspective of an  elderly man looking back on his one true love.  If you are young, you can  learn something about true love from this story, that it truly will hit you  out of the blue and will grab onto your heart and soul, never letting go if  it's truly meant to be. I shared this one with a friend and she finished it  in one sitting!	1999-12-21

This book can be read in one sitting, but you'll want to go back again and again to remind yourself of just how much we allow the minutia of life to overcome us.  My yellow hi-lighter worked overtime for me, making notes on  all the relevant issues that affect my sense of well being each day.  SMALL  STUFF forces you to look at how silly our worries sometimes are, how to put  nearly everything into perspective, and how to genuinely believe that it's  all SMALL stuff!	1999-02-01
