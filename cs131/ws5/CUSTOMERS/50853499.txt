On its own, ON A LONG AGO NIGHT is a pretty decent story of a long-ago-pirate-in-Middle-East-loves-me love story rekindled in Regency England. There are some great tender emotional scenes between the two, but frankly, it is too similar to previous book THE PRICE OF INNOCENCE for  comfort.<br />Hero and heroine meet and have a very mad affair.

I'm somewhat reluctant to admit that I'm bored flat by the whole coochie of love scenes. The start of the book has a gratuitous scene of bondage-........ involving Damien and an actress, and that sets the tone of The Seduction - a no-holds barred hot, hot read. I must be getting older  than I thought, because I was bored enough to start glossing over the many  scenes. When I peel away all those heavy breathings and moanings and  groanings, what's left is a very substandard exercise in clich&eacute;.<br /><br />What  makes Damien a hero? He's a rake, and he uses women like toys. But since he  also loves gardening, he knows his classics - aww, how sweet - and he takes  time to make sure the actresses and mistresses &quot;find pleasure&quot; in  his sessions, I guess that makes him a cut above the other womanizers  prowling around. Oh, and he is also a big man, reaching past his navel, or  so I'm told so many times. I guess size is also a virtue.<br /><br />Her late  husband was an adulterer, popular among mistresses, widows, and actresses.  But somehow he was brutal to Vanessa in bed, never once giving her a  climax. You'd think a man so successfully promiscuous when he was alive  would know how to bring a woman her pleasures, but somehow, no. Go figure  out yourself how this man got so many extra-marital affairs if he was so  lousy in bed.<br /><br />Me, I think it all boils down to two words: plot  clich&eacute;.<br />Maybe it's because I'm tired of the whole Good Girl/Bad Girl  complex. Am I supposed to believe that Vanessa is okay to be loved because  she's not like those actresses or prostitutes that Damien favors? Am I  supposed to root for Damien because he knows his Shakespeare and he has  read suffragette tracts?<br /><br />The author fails to convince me that Vanessa  is more than just a novelty, not when she makes Vanessa yet another  standard Proper Heroine Giving Herself To A Rake To Save The Family.<br />That's the one fatal flaw about this long-delayed Nicole Jordan romance.  I'm afraid this time my glasses don't fog up, but my eyes have a hard time  keeping focused on the pages. Sometimes sex isn't enough, I'm afraid. Not  for me anyway.le Jordan romance.

This story is basically Sleeping Beauty with a role-reversal twist - the hero's the sleeping beau here. Years ago, Alain Devereaux lost his one true love Brigette to an evil curse of the latter's dead hubby. A sorceress  takes pity on him and puts him into a magical sleep, where he would awake  from when Brigette is reborn in another time and place.<br /><br />Alain in his  crystal coffin gets passed on the sorceress Odette's descendents. The  coffin ruin quite a many of these women's lives. Now, in New Orleans in  year 2000, Danielle Curtis sees her boyfriend head for greener pastures,  thanks to a big conflict about that Thing In The Coffin Upstairs. Dani has  seen her parents' marriage detoriate thanks to That Thing, and Dani has to  scarifice her Olympic Gold Medal in Gymnastics, again thanks to That Darned  Thing. She's had it with responsibilities. She takes a knife in an  impulsive attempt to mutilate that... you know, but lo, Sleeping Beau  awakens.<br /><br />Alain now has 30 days to find Brigette and marry her before  he disappears from existance. Dani finds herself helping him, and things  get a bit sticky when Alain identifies the new and improved Brigette as  Cate George, actress. And Brigette's evil hubby may be also reborn in the  present. And of course, Dani feels the hormone thing about Alain too. Oh  dearie me.<br /><br />SILVER RAIN is an entertaining story about magic, but as a  romance, it kinda flounders. I sympathize with Dani's initial hostility  about that darned man in the coffin business ruining her life. I would ma  that man with the hardest rolling pin myself if he ruined my life the way  he ruined Dani's. And come to think of it, when Alain asks me to help him  find Brigette, my first reaction would be to kick his butt out of the door.  Dani is a better woman than me, I must say.<br /><br />The trouble is, very  little of the story is devoted to Alain's point of view. Hence for the most  time I'm subjected to Dani's thoughts. Which means Alain is trying to woo  Cate, not Brigette. Then, suddenly Alain is sleeping with Dani while  mooning for Cate. My eyes narrowed into tiny slits of annoyance at this  point because since I have no idea what makes Alain tick, he comes off a  horny, flacky creepo. And the abrupt confession of love from him at the  last few chapters don't ring true because frankly, I have no idea what is  going on in his head.<br /><br />And to be honest, I don't find Alain a sexy  hero. He is always befuddled and making Dani do everything for him for  setting him up with Cate all the way to showing him the wonders of modern  plumbing. A lost, hapless St Bernard doggie who keeps requiring my constant  pampering and time and help isn't what I would call hero material, no  matter how adorable a St Bernard Alain reminds me at times. Guess Dani  likes her man that way, but I find Alain more of a lost child than a sexy  hero. Worse, a child who doesn't seem to be able to take care of himself or  do anything. (I'm old fashioned in that I like my heroes to be able to do  things, you know.)<br /><br />The romance in SR isn't very absorbing, but I must  say everything else in the plot is very engaging and entertaining. SR makes  a better book as a paranormal story with some romance-lite thrown in. It's  entertaining, but as a romance, it misses the mark.means Alain is trying to woo  Cate, not Brigette.

She is about to confront her father Arthur when the whole town of Chicago is hit by the Great Fire. And among the confusion in comes Tom Silver like an avenging angel, wanting to put a bullet through  Arthur's head. Instead, he ends up taking Deborah hostage.<br /><br />See, years  ago several men working in Arthur's silver mine died in an explosion. Among  them is a young boy who was Tom's brother (not biological, but more of a  kindred kind). Tom and the surviving members of the victims of the disaster  see the accident as a result of greed and negligence on Arthur's part. And  Tom, never actually quite a samaritan, loses all focus in his life after  Asa's death and now he lives just for revenge.<br /><br />But of course, among  the isolated wilderness of Isle Royale, with the moon and stars above, who  knows what will happen, eh?<br /><br />Now, I love THE HOSTAGE, which I feel is  the author is back in top form after the dip into Muzaksville with THE  HORSEMASTER'S DAUGHTER. It is, however, not her best work, although it is a  very good book. Tom and Deborah's relationship, despite the sleazy  captor-captive scenario, always ring true.<br /><br />Deborah slowly shines  under adversity, blossoming into a woman of courage and slowly gaining  self-confidence along the way. It is easy to see why Tom would be attracted  to a woman like Deborah. She's an intriguing mix of feminine assertiveness  with enough but not too much distress factor to get his manliness all  hackled up. And Tom is indeed a nice man, lonely and lost, that I'm  half-tempted to shove Deborah off the scene and comfort Tom myself.<br /><br />TH is vintage Wiggs - explosive emotions, slowly unfurling of the  relationship which is a friends-first lovers-later sort (my favorite sort,  because these sort of relationships are always the most convincing), and  great handling of character conflicts that never gets bogged down into a  head-banging session in trauma welfare.<br /><br />But I have one quibble - this  book is around 200 pages too short. The premise is such that these two are  antagonists in the first half of the book. The relationship between Tom and  Deb, therefore, takes awhile to blossom, and by the time they are almost  there, the author fits in a rushed ending of bullets and fire, and next  thing I know an epilogue is shoved at my face. What is this? Deb is just  realizing her full strength and courage. Tom is just slowly letting go of  the past, and - zaaaaap! - they're making babies one year later?<br /><br />I  feel so cheated! And I'm not too pleased of the way the author handled  Arthur's fate, the man has so much potential for redemption by a nice,  spirited widow or something in his own book.<br /><br />TH is good, but it also  offers promises and hints of things to come that are never delivered.

Let's see - the heroine who believes 100% in the hero after her first ooh-la-la  (convincing, I'm sure) and then is led on like a puppy by that man, for  one.

Mat Jorik is a big baby trapped in a caveman's body and his girlfriend is a wimp. Sure, the  conversation is fun, the kids are fun, but the two main characters are just  plain boring.<br />I have no idea how they could fall for each other, unless,  of course, one believes in babies being reason enough for a happily ever  after. Likewise, Mat's behaviour is boorish and immature for too long in  the story, I can't help but to pity the heroine who, undoubtedly, would  have to babysit babies all her life here onwards.<br />And the epilogue makes  me cringe, because since dear Cornelia shows little authority or charisma  in the story... the epilogue makes me wince on behalf of the rest of USA in  FL.<br />The author has the knack for making endearing bad boy heroes - Kenny  Traveler in &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; (which I recommend wholeheartedly) for  one. But Mat just doesn't end up right, the whole romance lacks color or  life, and most of FL is reminiscent of everything cliched about  contemporary romances.<br />Definitely not the best SEP romance out there.	2000-02-19

The heroine is a silly woman who isn't sure whether she wants  to boink Harry, mistrust him, or take on the Mafia single-handedly. When  these two characters spend their time bickering (or boinking) with little  quiet moments to tell me they actually feel more than lust for each  other... well, I don't think I really buy it.<br />Oh, there's a sympathetic  teenage boy and a poor wronged woman of ill repute, but with Harry and his  girlfriend and Harry's mule of a partner and the latter's messy love  triangle causing a spillover of unpleasantness over every page, I just stop  caring.<br />I wonder what's wrong with this story - I mean, everyone loves it  but me! But upon some introsprective thinking, I decide that  &quot;Bodyguard&quot; fails where &quot;Heartthrob&quot; succeeds because  the former never actually succeeds in convincing me that the two main  characters are in for real.

People  talk in grandiose manners - &quot;I will die if you will ever leave  me!&quot; - they even die in impressive manners, slowly falling down  staircases in slow-mo.<br />It doesn't help that the heroine's name is Kitty,  and her Barbie-doll name only reflects her nature fully as she clings to  the hero whenever there's trouble. The hero with his superhuman strength  can do everything, too bad that everything doesn't include some semblence  of human emotion.<br />Grandiosity, corniness, and some really cheesy  adventures (check out the &quot;Swimming With Crocodiles&quot; scene!) can  be fun when one mixes in enough humor and wit. Humor and wit are clearly  lacking in &quot;My One And Only&quot; - rendering it a total loss even as  a guilty pleasure.	2000-01-25

Simple yet cunning, this woman can stand on her own. Which makes her attraction to helpless bystander Max all the more inexplicable. Why would an independent  woman fall for a man who can't make up his mind most of the time? Why make  the Other Woman take all the blame in the end?<br />Apologies for fans of the  Evil Other Woman plots, but the fact that the author takes the pains to  spin a carefully-crafted story only to resort to a cliched ending... that's  the true anticlimax.	2000-01-24

Grand passion? Interesting and body-stretching positions? Well, the hero here prefers the missionary position. What a disappointment.<br />And the story  isn't anything new as well. It's readable, but I can't help wondering where  they hid the real Master of Seduction.	2000-01-24

Jackson is a man  who actually moves heaven and earth (figuratively) for the heroine Cammy,  and for this alone, I am already moved. Jackson and Cammy are so right  together, their quiet moments so tender yet funny, it's hard not to love  this book.<br />Ms Hart is a rare author who makes me cry and laugh at the  same time (check out the last few chapters!). &quot;A Kiss To Dream  On&quot; is indeed one of the best stories I've ever read in a long time.  Excuse me while I dig into my bag of bad puns - this book is indeed &quot;a  story to dream on&quot;.	2000-01-24

An unusual Amazonian heroine with a yen for discipline and an unrepetent rogue who loves women in all incarnations. Put them together and ... kaboom. Really.<br />Ms Coulter somehow gets everything right in this book.  The humor, the characters, the silly secondary characters, even the names  of the secondary characters! There's plenty of laughter as the hero tries  his best to get into the heroine's leather pantyhose without losing his  heart in the process. Plenty of intrigue as a magical lamp, a horse-race  mad preacher and Helen's champagne-mad father stir up trouble. And then  there's the hero, a naughty lad who's a rogue with the easiest charm this  side of the world.<br />For a good time with two characters who make no  apologies for their past and isn't afraid to take the plunge... - by all mean, dive in &quot;The Courtship&quot;!  You'll have a grand time. I did.	2000-01-24

Ms Brockway returns to top form after the disappointing &quot;The Passionate One&quot;. The story is unrelentingly dark and turbulent, with two characters tortured beyond tortured, but they find redemption through  their love for each other. Raine and Favor are two people whose lives have  been filled with nothing but pain and guilt and loneliness - watching them  complete the hollow in each's soul is simply an enchanting  experience.<br />The story is filled with exciting intrigue and the villian  Ronald Merrick, Earl of Carr deserves the Loreena Bobbitt's VIP Cut  Treatment. The secondary characters shine - Fia, Gunna - these people are  as real as Raine and Favor.<br />Great plot, wonderful love, and an utterly  satisfied reader - that's a great combination, right?	2000-01-24
US	50853499	R27254TNLY3R69	0553578421	960341723	Magic Spells	Books	3	3	8	N	N	Not exactly Hoffman.	&quot;Practical Magic&quot; ain't what this book is. Too often the prose goes overboard until it is substanceless. A greater crime is the treatment of the main characters - Jane is a stereotypical can't-trust-men doormat,  Graham is your usual passive-SNAG-good guy, Devon is the usual rebel  without a cause.<br />Jane's oscillating emotions and clueless behavior when  it comes to men causes her to come off more often than not an immature  woman who would be the first to appear on Jerry Springer. And of course,  she can't trust men and she's not worthy of any men, while Devon can't be  decent because he loves the notion of being unworthy of any decent woman  too much. And Graham waits in the corner, the nice guy he is.<br />Maybe next  time. Until then, it's still &quot;Practical Magic&quot; for me.	2000-01-04
US	50853499	R3RJWCNGBXJ0ND	0380802600	167045660	The Proposition	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Will I? You betcha.	Judith Ivory can't do wrong. Really. She doesn't just write - &quot;The Proposition&quot; is a gorgeous piece of artwork. And it is romantic too. Mick and Winnie are two of the best characters I've ever read in a novel,  and just in time for the New Year too. What a treat!<br />Yes, I admit the  ending is tad too convenient and unworthy of an author who has taken risks  before in her stories in the past, but I can't really complain. Every word  is lush, romantic, and sweet while the foreplay and love scenes are hot  enough to scorch. Judith Ivory can sure create romantic yet  erotically-charged romances with characters I care deeply about, and for  that, I'm in awe.<br />Will I? Get out of the way, here I come! You bet I  will.	1999-12-30

How long would the novelty last?<br />In  &quot;My False Heart&quot;, its strongest points are the hero's convincing  nobility underneath his dissolute front, and he has a worthy match in the  heroine.<br />Indeed, the woman in question may be a token innocent, but she  is obviously intelligent enough to challenge the hero's jaded senses. The  hero's slow bond of affection with her family is so well done that yes, I  believe he will and can be a good husband to her and a guardian to her  siblings. The love and sexual tension are explosive.<br />The only flaw is the  overabundance of external plots, but that's okay. This is the author's  first book, and already it shows enough brilliance in terms of character  and relationship building. Bring on the rest, Ms Carlyle, I can't wait for  more.	1999-12-21

I adore the two main characters and the secondary characters, especially Aunt Florence.<br />However, points are deducted for too much coincidences in the  story and too many interrupted foreplay. Next time Emory'd better lock the  bedroom door AND the windows annd place a bazooka by the bed to shoot any  interrupters before he and Annaleah check each other's tonsils.	1999-12-18

Thanks to this book, I'm now in love with Ireland. Ireland is beautiful and glorious and the skies are blue and strangers open their doors wide for me.<br />But frankly, this story is snoozesville. The heroine is your typical  sappy no-confidence no-clue woman who realizes, &quot;Gee! I don't love my  ex!&quot; while having tea with a Wise Woman in a scenic inn. The hero is  your typical see-her-want-her tepid sort of guy. What's to stop them from  snogging at first sight? Well, there's always the heroine's contrived  no-confidence plot angle.<br />This book is pretty, scenic, well-written, but  it is also slow-moving and nothing actually happens. All that's missing is  the &quot;Sound Of Music&quot; soundtrack when Jude walks around Ye Irish  Countryside.<br />File this under &quot;Favorites Of The Irish Tourism  Board&quot;.	1999-12-18

I always love Ms London's way of writing, but really, this book is padded too many a characters. Everyone has issues, and everyone loves someone (except the psycho). There are three brothers and their father who love  their respective girlfriends, and these men and women have to deal with  their relationships with everyone else. Then, we have a mad rapist-wannabe  sending underwear to one of our heroines.<br />When it is time for the final  Big Hug scene, I'm just too tired to keep score to care. It is as if four  short stories are glued into one big romance. Sometimes many isn't better.	1999-12-18

This is a delightful seafaring romp featuring a refreshingly non-wimpy heroine and a gruffy but good-natured hero. The relationship between the hero and heroine is well-done, with just the right blend of passion and  laughter.<br />Indeed, while Sophia's bungling around the &quot;Miss  Deed&quot; may be a bit hard to swallow, she makes up for it with a healthy  dose of spunkiness and fire. And Jack is an intelligent and kind man  despite his bluster.<br />When I finish this book with a big smile, why, yes,  I'd call this a keeper. Jack and Sophia are indeed two of the funniest and  well, perfect romantic leads I've ever read. It is easy to believe a  happily ever after for them.<br />One thing though: the cover depicts a nice  garden scene. The closest thing to a garden in this book is the Yukatan  forest. What is the art department thinking?	1999-12-18
