Unfortunately, this one just didn't grab me and hold my interest.  I thought Callie was, frankly, very annoying.  As a big fan of the &quot;In Death&quot; series, I thought I saw a little recycling of &quot;Eve&quot; in Callie, but without her humor and heart.  I thought the story line about Callie running into her true parents while on the &quot;dig&quot; a bit far fetched and ultimately I wasn't particularly touched by any of that story line.  As always, Mrs. Robert's does her research and the technical look at a &quot;dig&quot; was interesting. Given all the books this prolific author turns out every year, I guess I can't complain when one of them lets me down.  She is still one of the best writers out there for romance and mainstream romance/thriller genre.	2003-07-16

When I saw that he was a Pelecanos fan, that's what drew my interest. Not only did this book entertain and keep me guessing, but I found myself re-evaluating my own attitudes about discrimmination and stereotypes that plagued the complex character of Terry Quinn in the book.

No one writes a family series in romance better than Nora Roberts.  My only complaint is that the publisher, looking much too closely at the $$ bottom line, made this a hardback book instead of paperback like the others in this series.  My advice to anyone thinking about purchasing this book--DON'T.  Borrow it or go to your public library.  If you still want to own it, wait until the paperback is released.  While this is a wonderful romance novel, it's not hardback worthy unless money is not your main concern.  Otherwise, it's a great story and a fun read.	2002-12-12

In the character, Tempe, the author has created an interesting, strong, yet vulnerable character it would be very hard for anyone not to like.  So smart, and yet so foolish, when she allows her stubborn and often impetuous streak to get the best of her. For us the results of that happening normally wouldn't put us in danger.  When it happens to Tempe, she finds herself in a life or death situation which is, of course, why we all love to read fiction.  Personally, I'm enjoying Tempe's forensic/anthropology world as it ties into crime, and the complexities involved when Tempe transitions herself between her worlds in Quebec and NC.  The love interest character of Ryan is a nice balance with all the other heavier, grusome story lines.  I'm also not disappointed that their relationship has been allowed to grow slowly--more maturely I think--given their ages and past disappointments with relationships.  Watching the trust grow between them, along with the lust, has made for very enjoyable reading as well.  This last in the series is a fine addition and I was not disappointed.	2002-11-14

I started this series with the first book, &quot;Deja Dead&quot;, and was pleasantly surprised to find the second in the series even more difficult to put down.  I find Ms. Reich's complex plots with all their twists and turns undaunting, and in fact, much more enjoyable than some of the other writers in this genre that seem to apply a cookie cutter approach to their prose.  I especially like that Tempe is well rounded and that as readers, we have a better understanding of this character because of the writer's penchant for detail.  Whether it be as an anthropologist, or as a woman, this character is fully drawn and very compelling.  Because of this, I can forgive some of the author's unrealistic circumstances into which Tempe often falls prey.  The growing relationship between her and Rayan is well developed.  I doubt, however, that there is any sort of smooth ride ahead for these two.  I'm about to start #3, and I can't wait!	2002-10-17

There is no cookie cutter at work here. Dark Horse didn't disappoint, in fact, I had a hard time putting it down. Strong characters, an interesting relationship twist, and a gritty, complex plot for this &quot;whodonit&quot; keeps readers guessing at all the answers until the very end.  With a cast of characters pretty much all guilty of something, it was very difficult to figure out this intricate crime-on-crime until the writer decided to reveal it.

I didn't give this one my usual 5 stars because I have to admit that some aspects of the story-telling are getting a little repetitive. Certainly one can't love this series and not love the characters.  They are always a strength of this writer and she is continues to be true to them.  While we get to enjoy their growth and the changes that make them come alive and believable to us as readers, I have to admit that I'm getting a little tired of Eve's overly familar idiosyncracies.  When I start to skip over paragraphs because I've read the same thing in all the previous books, it might be time for the writer to figure out how to freshen up this series a bit. While I do realize that each book must also be written for people who have never read any of the others,  I think the criticism of Ms. Roberts proliferation abilities might be starting to ring true.  The Janet Evanovich series with Stephanie Plum come out once a year, and I think they just keep getting better.  ARE YOU LISTENING NORA?

While I agree that the &quot;voice&quot; in this story often changes too quickly and can be confusing, that flaw is easy to overlook when compared to the creativity and deeply moving story.  Whenever a writer forces the reader to feel, think and touch a personal spiritual well, how can we criticize her for an editorial error in putting the ending as the very first chapter?

While Ripley's &quot;witch denial&quot; gets a little irritating at times, Ms. Roberts ability to make her characters ring true, (with real human qualities), remains consistent in this book.  It's only natural that some characters are more appealing than others. But in the end, a good romance writer will find a way to reconcile their imperfections to the satisfaction of the reader. That's exactly what happens in Ripley's case.  <br />I live with an &quot;absent minded professor&quot;, and Mac's imperfections were right on.  Through my work, I once met a doctorate in paranormal activity who, just like Mac, had designed equipment for reading paranormal &quot;activity&quot;.  He traveled to haunted houses and castles all over the world.  Perhaps some readers thought that Mac's professional was a figment of the writer's imagination.  It is not. While she may have embellished, much of what she wrote was very consistent with my experience.<br />Another great read!	2002-01-30

Thank goodness Ms. Galbadon didn't give in to typical pressures placed on authors who write a series.  Instead of pandering to soap opera readers, she stayed true to herself and gave us a beautiful and satisfying tapestry into life on Frasier Ridge. This book allows our favorite characters to grow.  It allows the reader a detailed and interesting look into the establishment and readjustment to the characters new life in America.  I have to wonder if the people who criticised this book as &quot;too slow&quot;, aren't the same people who prefer epic movies with special effects and poor story lines over a smaller movie with a great story and wonderful acting.  Relationships grow, children grow, and Aunt Jocasta's wedding reads a little like an Agatha Christie mystery complete with a murder.  There is drama, there is conflict, there is adventure.  Not only will you continue to love Claire and Jamie, whose relationship continues to satisfy, but you will grow to love Brianna, Roger and baby Jemmy as they bond as a family and mature into the challenges of their new life.<br />Read this book slowly.  Savor the carefully crafted images and character development.  This book sets up, what I hope will be, number 6 in this series.  Then, no doubt, there will be enough rape and pillage, blood and guts from the Revolutionary War that should satisfy any soap opera reader who thought this book too dull.  In the meantime, &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot; gives us a welcome breather into normal life on Frasier Ridge.  DON'T MISS IT!	2002-01-07

I am constantly amazed by reviews from readers who try to place harsh literary restrictions on the romance genre.

I may not find her choice of a story my personal favorite, but I always come away feeling like the price and my time was worth it. And so it is with &quot;Midnight Bayou&quot;. As is the case with all her books, her characters are interesting and her stories creatively unique.

All Nora Roberts fans have their own expectations when they purchase one of her books. Rarely does she disappoint. In the end, it isn't her talent in question, but her choice of story telling and ending that may conflict with the readers preferences. I had to chuckle just a little when reading some of the other reviews. Criticizing a romance author for overkill when describing a character is like criticizing Mel Gibson for being &quot;Mel Gibson&quot;. It just comes with the genre! A writer is doing their job by arousing emotions in the reader. Sometimes you may not like those emotions, but that's life, isn't it?  Like every book Nora has written about Ireland, this series was not only entertaining, but it also gave us a longing for a culture, a family, and a life we will never have. As readers, we would all do better to focus on &quot;the journey&quot;, and not &quot;the destination&quot;. Sure, I would have enjoyed a little more closure at the end about Carrick and Gwen.

I'm a fan of all Ms. Robert's books, but I had to give this one 4 stars because I figured out &quot;who did it&quot; almost immediately.  Otherwise, it was an enjoyable story but easier to put down than others in  the past.  Ms. Roberts, who somehow never fails to deliver the goods to her  fans, manages to keep her writing fresh while word processing her work out  at a rate other authors must find mind blowing.      I must say, though,  that I don't think this particular story was hard back worthy.  Perhaps  because I figured out &quot;whodonit&quot; so easily, I wish I hadn't had  to spend quite so much money for this particular book.  Before, I wouldn't  have hesitated to make the investment in one of her hard back books.  After  this experience, I might be a little more careful next time around before  running out and making the investment.  I still love you, Nora.  Keep them  coming!	1999-03-18

To pigeonhole the trials of Julia Weslin and the relationship that grows between her and K. C.  Houston as a typical romance novel certainly doesn't due this book justice.  Satisfying at just about every level, I couldn't  put it down.  Ms. Eagle did an especially good job of pacing the  relationship between the two main characters with the same patience K. C.  used on his horses.  The result was a more realistic book in many ways than  &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;.  If you loved Tom Booker, you'll enjoy the  way Ms. Eagle gave her hero the same gift with horses, but used her  creativity to make K. C. Houston equally interesting yet fascinatingly  unique in his own way.  The plot, the minor characters, and of course, the  horses give this tale equal parts of color, depth and humor with enough  emotional twists to keep just about any reader happy.  <br />I've enjoyed all  Ms. Eagle's books, but without a doubt, this is my favorite.	1999-01-19

(alias Nora Roberts) Robb continues to entertain and surprise with this latest in her &quot;Death&quot; series.   Watching Eve's emotional growth catch up with her laser edged, cop brain has been a lot of  the fun in this series.  I hope the author continues allowing Eve and  Rourke to deepen their marriage relationship beyond their current sexual  frenzy.  Not that getting steamy with them hasn't been a kick. It's just  time to add a new ingredient to the marital cocktail that Ms. Robb has  already shaken and stirred. Peabody is a delight, and I'd like to see her  develop a little more too.  Of course, none of us can ever get enough of  Rourke.  These two characters who couldn't possibly be right for each  other, have turned out to be absolute perfection together.  Since life  rarely works out this way, isn't it fun to read a little futuristic,  romantic mystery and discover how much fun it is to escape reality.    Thanks for another fun read, J.D.	1998-11-19

For those of us who have read just about everything this master story teller has written, &quot;The Reef&quot; did not disappoint. No one does it better than Nora Roberts for light, entertaining reading with a lusty  punch.  Her books may not have the literary depth of a &quot;Cold  Mountain&quot;, which I also very much enjoyed, but then, I also like an  ice cream cone once in awhile too!  For this particular genre, Ms. Roberts  has earned her crown with consistently great story telling.	1998-11-11
US	52585939	R160K1VYO4FW94	038531700X	117143822	The Loop	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A compelling story about a very timely environmental issue.	As a fan of &quot;Whisperer&quot;, I began &quot;The Loop&quot; clearly  intent on not making comparisons.  I wanted to let this book stand on its  own, and for me, it certainly did.  Mr. Evans is at his best when he opens  our minds and our hearts to the mysteries of nature.  The fascinating pack  of wolves are really the center of the story around which all the human  characters evolve.  Sensitive readers will be horrified reading about the  device for which the book was named--animal lover or not. For myself, the  characters were well drawn with clear motivations and actions that rang  true.  It is easy to understand many readers missing the spiritual  character of a Tom Booker from this novel. Maybe reality just doesn't allow  a character like him in every story.  I like to think that a more mature  Luke would share many of the same qualities we loved so much in Tom. While  Helen and Luke did not enter the story as emotionally appealing characters,  by the end of the book they had most certainly grown into stronger, more  interesting people.  In many ways, I found the ending of &quot;Loop&quot;  more satisfying than &quot;Whisperer&quot;, and almost as much of a  surprise.   &quot;Loop&quot; is a great read that held  my interest from  beginning to end.  If you loved &quot;Whisperer&quot;, don't let the  &quot;naysayers&quot; put you off.  Buy it and make up your own mind.  For  people who see life as only black and white and just &quot;don't get  it&quot; when it turns mystically gray, I say, &quot;find another  author&quot;.	1998-10-27

This series is so vividly well written, that  when at last I'm forced to put the book down, I immediately feel the need  for a shower! I enjoyed this second in the series almost as much as the  first. The middle of the book went a little slow, and I felt that Alex's  death scene with Jamie and Jack in the room together didn't quite ring  true.  If I had been &quot;used&quot; and tortured as Jamie had been by the  perverted Jack Randall, I don't think I'd have been quite as sensitive to  his feelings, beloved brother or not. We know our Jamie is delightfully  more than any mere mortal, but even he has his limits of endurance shown  more realistically in other parts of the saga.  The satisfying ending left  me hungry for more. Isn't it nice that I had the foresight to puchase  &quot;Voyager&quot; so I don't have to wait. It's a compliment to Ms.  Gabaldon that when I travel with her back to 1745 Scotland, my husband has  a difficult time getting me back.  Thanks again for another satisfying  read!	1998-09-27
US	52585939	R3302SSNAPXE63	0440212561	983256815	Outlander	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	Scottish history laced liberally with lusty romance.	I made the mistake of reading &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; first and was disappointed, not realizing that there were three books that came before.  Yes, Ms. Gabaldon's fascination with Scotish history and attention to detail can bog down the faint of heart.  But for others who are looking for a good excuse to read &quot;Romance&quot;, (in their hearts they know they LOVE the lust, but have to justify it someway) OUTLANDER more than adequately delivers.  Although Clair, at times, seems almost too perfect in her ability to adjust to early 1700's Scotland, you can forgive Ms. Gabaldon because she gives us Jamie.  Oh, yes, he's too good to be true too, but we can easily forgive him.  Ms. Gabaldon proves the theory that there is a lot to be said for a younger man.  My only caution would be the vividly explicit homosexual sex and torture scenes.  My own goose bumps and shivers were a physical reaction to very bloody mental pictures.  A compliment to the author, but not a good read for everyone. (I recommend the squeamish buy the book anyway and just skip those parts.)  They really don't want to miss this very entertaining and &quot;educational&quot; read.	1998-09-18
US	52585939	RXWNYS1CHRS23	0446605972	917004128	The Passions of Emma	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Love can wear many different faces	In this delightful story, Ms. Williamson deftly shows how love continues  to &quot;make the world go around&quot;.  Historically rich, this tale  transports us back into the late 1800's and vividly depicts the colorful  but conscienceless rich against the black and white goodness of the Irish  poor.  If readers step outside the &quot;romance&quot; for a minute of  reflection, they might wonder that things haven't changed enough in the  last 100 years.  Although we love to hate them, some readers will be  uncomfortably familiar with the characters who control the story with their  selfish brand of love. Though they are capable of unforgivable acts, their  pathetic emotional limitations make us feel a little sorry for them.  On  the other hand, Bria's saintly, unselfish love puts us all to shame.  Then  there is Emma with her ability to experience both kinds of love that makes  us just a little envious.   Thanks Ms. Williamson for another successful  combination of historical accuracy and damn good story telling.	1998-08-23

I'm a Nora Roberts fan so that makes me partial to all her books.  Marrying a Quinn of my own, who also taught English and Literature for 20 years, may also be making this series more personally satisfying for me.  But, in the genre of &quot;Romance&quot;, most serious readers know that if we want to invest our $7.50 wisely for entertaining and compelling stories, Ms. Roberts is always a great value.  Thoroughly enjoyed the first in this series, but loved Rising Rising Tides probably a little more because of Ethan and Grace.  The struggles of these two very real characters will have a way of touching every reader's own reality bank just enough to make them uncomfortable. No matter what the cause of the fears we struggle to overome, if for no other reason, this book reinforces the importance of winning our own personal battles. When we cop-out or wear those convenient &quot;denial&quot; glasses, in the end we are such huge losers.  Can't wait for Phil's story in &quot;In! ner Harbor&quot;, and for what I'm sure will be a very satisfying ending to this particularly enjoyable series.  Love you Nora!	1998-07-27

People may discount my opinion as &quot;name&quot; biased, but I thoroughly enjoyed this first book in Nora Robert's new trilogy.  I re-read it a second time last week in anticipation of &quot;Rising Tides&quot;, and enjoyed it almost as much as the first.  While Cam and Anna possess the sexy looks and wild passion sadly beyond the comprehension of mere mortals like us, it was fun to watch the sparks fly with these two interesting characters.  It looks like Ethan and Grace share more down-to-earth roles in this trilog, and I look forward to meeting them as well as watching Seth blossom in the love of this unique Quinn family.  As true &quot;Romance&quot; fans know, these stories are not designed to compete with Jane Austin.  Understanding the genre, and appreciating the gift a writer must have to be as prolific as Nora Roberts, I say &quot;thank you&quot; to a writer who never disappoints her readers.  She continues to set the standard for my tastes in this genre along ! ! with Debra Smith, Penelope Williamson and Tami Hoag.	1998-07-17

Just when her fans think she simply can't produce anything better than our most favorite of her previous books, the queen steps up to the plate and hits another home run with her diamond tierra! My husband groans a little when he sees me reading another Nora Roberts book.  But not for long. He knows that getting my attention while my eyes are glued and glazed carries the same odds as winning &quot;Megabucks&quot; here in Las Vegas.  But, he's a smart man.  He knows that it won't be long until Nora's well crafted romance, misted with just the right amount of eau de lust, will ultimately work in his favor.  They call Ms. Roberts a &quot;prolific writer&quot;. For those of us who have read and enjoyed every one of her books, she simply can't be prolific enough to ever satisfy our imaginations.   We bow at your feet, Queen Nora...long live the queen!  (P.S.:  Can't you write a little faster?)	1998-07-09

I had previously read &quot;Hearts of the West&quot; by Ms. Williamson and was pleasantly surprised to find &quot;The Outsider&quot; even more enjoyable.  Perhaps the conflict of cultures provided an unusual twist of interest, but I also found very satisfying the way the author slowly developed the passionate love story.  She also accomplished this in &quot;Hearts of the West&quot;, but in &quot;Outsider&quot; the characters didn't have a brother &quot;in the way&quot;, just their own code of ethics. Like all of Ms. Williamson's characters, they are well drawn and interesting.  As a woman, I find her men particularly compelling and fascinating.  Her attention to detail and authenticity makes her stories even harder to put down.  Thanks, Ms. Williamson, for another great read!	1998-07-08
