Nothing could be further from the truth.  Antonin Artaud was a man interested in nothing less than the violent exhumation of real life from the cold, icy tomb that civilization has attempted to seal it in.<br /><br />As we see here in his letters to the sympathetic, but ultimately helpless Jacques Riviere, Artaud's suffered from a kind of hypochondria of the mind which resulted from his scorching intensity of thought.  He explicitly rejected happiness as the goal of human existence, and this is what separated him not only from the surrealists but from other thinkers of his age and ours.  Perhaps he put it best himself in his own strange, archaic language:<br /><br />\\"For nothing bestializes a being like the taste for eternal happiness, the search for eternal happiness at any price, and mademoiselle Lucifer is that slut who never wanted to abandon eternal happiness.\\"<br /><br />There will be nothing in this anthology that the Artaud admirer has not already seen, although the whole text (particularly the photographs of Artaud starring in Dreyer's \\"Joan of Arc\\" and Gance's \\"Napoleon\\"), comes together like a bizarre little work of art.  I have referred to it repeatedly, given it away, purchased it again.  The most important piece that this little publication has to offer is \\"I Hate and Renounce As a Coward\\"..., which is at the very end:the closest thing we have to a coherent philosophical position from Artaud.  Also, \\"Van Gogh:The Man Suicided By Society\\", which is more about Artaud than Van Gogh, gives us an indispensable glimpse into the psyche of the genuinely tortured, doomed artist.<br /><br />There are moments in which Artaud becomes as important in his commentary on the human condition, as thinkers like Nietzsche, Plato, Pascal, and all of the greats.  Unlike in their work, though, it is not maintained consistently.  This is also the case with his poetry.  His internal anguish did not allow him to consummate his enormous potential.  His value lies in the threat he poses to our complacency simply by virtue of his memory.<br /><br />Read \\"The Theatre And It's Double\\" first, and then tear through this.  Savor Artaud's sentences as you would a delicate meal you'd never tasted before.<br /><br />May the looming shadow of this demented renaissance man never stop haunting us.ently.

And if he hadn't murdered Daniel Faulkner in the 80's, he'd be just about nobody right now.<br /><br />This book is filled with horror stories from death row, and Jamal does do a good job of affecting the reader on a gut level--but other writers on the subject (less self interested than Jamal, and far less self important) have pointed out the racism inherent in the American judicial system far better.  The core of Jamal's writing voice (although it seems inconsistent at times, often degenerating into mere rage/personal bitterness rather than any objective viewpoint beneficial to the reader) is anger.  This in itself is no objection to his work, as this has been the case with many authors.  Jamal is not that compelling and his rants are turn-offs.<br /><br />Being a left-wing liberal, I took an interest in the case of Mumia Abu Jamal years ago.  It took about one week of research for me to realize that this guy is no political prisoner (although they exist:Leonard Peltier's \\"My Life Is A Sundance\\" is a good example of REAL activist writing from \\"inside the pen\\").  Anyone who has even a little intellectual integrity, right-wing or left-wing, conservative or liberal, has to concur that this guy is guilty after reading about the case.  If he admitted that he committed the crime I'd have a lot more respect for him and would keep reading him for his insider's accounts.  But with his laughable pretense of innocence, everything he writes is poison of a sort.  It is disturbing indeed to see so many of the literati cuddle up to him, some of them very talented:Alice Walker, Norman Mailer, etc.  Maybe if he gets real lucky Mailer can free yet another murderer, like he did with Jack Abbott, so they can kill someone else.<br /><br />I look forward to the day that Daniel Faulkner's wife writes a book about her horrendous experiences (one can only imagine what this must be like for her), having a nation of uninformed lefties, most of them under the age of 18, cozy up to her husband's killer.nation of uninformed lefties, most of them under the age of 18, cozy up to her husband's killer.	2005-09-16

There is a certain elegance and eerie understatement about his work that is the hallmark of a great talent.  While I think it would be unfair to compare him to Philip Larkin, who was far more of a conscious \\"Nay-sayer\\" than Justice ever was, his gentle melancholy and razor-blade lucidity pervade even his lighter work:<br /><br />\\"On The Death Of Friends In Childhood<br /><br />We shall not ever meet them bearded in heaven<br /><br />Nor sunning themselves among the bald of hell;<br /><br />If anywhere, in the deserted schoolyard at twilight,<br /><br />forming a ring, perhaps, or joining hands<br /><br />In games whose very names we have forgotten.<br /><br />Come memory, let us seek them there in the shadows\\"<br /><br />This luminous regret coupled with the appreciation of fleeting beauty is tempered by the not quite ultimate, but certainly undying, hope of a kind of redemption:<br /><br />\\"A Birthday Candle\\"<br /><br />Thirty today, I saw<br /><br />The trees flare briefly like<br /><br />The candles on a cake,<br /><br />As the sun went down the sky,<br /><br />A momentary flash,<br /><br />Yet there was time to wish\\"<br /><br />For all his seriousness, Justice was not afraid to play around, even sometimes employing Dadaist techniques in the subject matter of his poetry: \\"Ode To A Dressmaker's Dummy\\", one of his best pieces, was inspired by the instructions found on the back of a store-front window dummy. This is the kind of work that deserves national attention, and I have little doubt that Donald Justice's poetic legacy will with time become legendary.	2005-07-13

Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life	Books	4	23	27	N	N	Flawed, but exhilarating	Very rarely do we see the likes of a Michel Houllebecq--darling of the 21st century's aggressive postmodern nihlism, controversial writer both in the United States and France, champion of the \\"new\\" hedonistic revolt (is there really such a thing?)--join hands with the decomposed but very much alive likes of Howard Phillips Lovecraft, the legendary misfit of Providence.<br /><br />\\"Life is useless and disappointing\\", writes Houellebecq, and beginning from this premise attempts to tie such morbidly sacred short stories as \\"The Call of Cthulu\\" and \\"The Whisperer in the Darkness\\" in with what he envisions as the call of the true poet, \\"the creation of an entirely alternative world to this one\\".  Championing Lovecraft's life (more than his work) as an example of unparalleled existential defiance, he sees similarities between himself and the pulp writer who told us quite directly that we are nothing but floating electrons, gaseous entities destined to perish in a meaningless universe.  It goes without saying that Lovecraft himself was never as outspoken as Houllebecq, and that his quiet skepticism regarding all human hope is at almost complete odds with the French icon's exhibitionism.<br /><br />Still, there is something to be found here that is not to be found at all in the miles of scholarly toilet paper and mediocre biography heaped up HP since his death.  This is an impassioned attempt to understand the man who, like Kant, was suspected of not being fully human.  Lovecraft's tragic and reclusive plight in life, composed mostly of literature and his own doomy imaginings is in Houllebecq's eyes worthy of the most profound veneration.  Rather than saying the great Nietzschean \\"Yes\\" To Life\\", Lovecraft uttered a \\"No\\" without weakness or complaint.  His racism is recognized by Houellebecq for what it really was: a reviling of ALL things human, particularly that which sticks out from the standard heaps of flesh with any marked characteristic.  How everything went wrong almost consistently for Lovecraft in every aspect of his external life is given excruciating exposure.  I'd call this less of a \\"study\\" and more of a manifesto for hardline misanthropes.  (The introduction by Stephen King seems out of place at first glance, but strangely enough fits right in as one gets into the meat and potatoes of Houllebecq's rant.)  Included are what Houllebecq considers Lovecraft's most telltale work: \\"The Call of Cthulu\\" and \\"The Whisperer in the Darkness\\".almost consistently for Lovecraft in every aspect of his external life is given excruciating exposure.

Sad to say, since none of these guys would have wanted just to be novelties.  We have Jacques Rigaut, the morbid dandy who, according to the man who employed him for awhile, was not quite the dadaist rebel he played at being; Arthur Cravan, perhaps the highlight of the book, with his intoxicated adventures and bitingly witty dismissal of just about everything!  With Cravan, more so than Torma or Vache, one gets the sense of a man who could have been so much more than merely a scandalous figure who scribbled some opiated aphorisms.  Torma is a trip too, however, his creepily composed and pale phantom haunting the black and white pages with telling lines:\\"Perfection is mediocrity.  Only excess is beautiful\\".  And we have the infamous Jacques Vache, goofing off to Breton about the state of his own health and his possible impending death (or not).<br /><br />This is sort of an epitaph for four men who represented, in one way or another, the final \\"No\\" to values finally proved false.  One wonders, though, while being awed by their enigmatic rebellion against society and art, whether they would have had anything to say had they not offed themselves so very quickly.  THIS however is the most bizarre book I have yet to encounter from Atlas Press, and that's saying something.  Beyond a must read, the ever sharpening sense of the edge and the immediacy of our lives in the face of death makes this a must have, right now.  Read it.	2005-04-07

Alquie's determination not to dismiss the philosophy of Surrealism as mere hedonistic tripe or pseudo-thought is inspiring, and he writes with a language that is<br /><br />vibrant and alive.<br /><br />We see the innumerable misinterpretations of the incandescent, sometimes impossible hope of the surrealist--Breton being taken for a Satanist, Nadja a glorified lunatic, etc--and Alquie does a slick job of essentially saying that while the surrealist philosophy (the ultimate combination of the real and the imaginary) may not be possible, it is worth dedicating a lifetime too.  He redeems what to an outsider or skeptic may seem flowery (and surrealism is anything but) nonsense.  Just by itself, this is one hell of a book and wonderfully written.  Better than the flashy, picture filled garbage we see so much nowadays.	2005-02-10

Morrison, unlike so many of the poetic idols (Shelley, Byron, Blake) he never lived long enough to equal (and perhaps transcend?) was not afraid to expose, explore and cut right down the middle any experience, line of thought, or moments of madness he had.  This works to both his benefit and detriment in his poetry as it did in his short life.<br /><br />More than the larger than life persona he tries to project in his early poems: (\\"Power)\\", Morrison is a conceptual and verbal magician, able to pack the weirdest and most minute philosophical observations into a few lines: \\"A man rakes leaves into a heap in his yard, a pile, and leans on his rake and burns them utterly/The fragrance fills the forest/children pause and heed the smell/which will become nostalgia in several years\\" (pg. 17). This is not all \\"intoxicated\\" poetry, not by any means.  Beneath all the poetic personas Morrison adopts through these crashing, manically curious experimental dives into the extremes of consciousness, one personality emerges again and again: that of the prophet.  In the tradition of Artaud and Rimbaud, Morrison as poet gives us a less polished but equally powerful diagnosis of a corrupt and diseased culture through his Berriganesque visions of hippiedom, his visionary observations of America as a nation and his place in it(\\"What am I doing in the bullring arena?\\"), tributes to fallen friends (\\"Ode To Brian Jones While Thinking of LA\\"),<br />and the recognition of his own fate in \\"As I Look Back\\".<br /><br />There is something else in this poetry behind the surreal streams of consciousness and the subtle calls to personal change, something which is so quiet and undetectable at first, and then which simply explodes in his retrospectives and self evaluations: vicious despair.  One can feel the rumbling chaos of the poet's life just by reading him for any extended period of time and it is not shocking when at long last the work simply stops.<br /><br />That said, this is some of the best poetry of the 60's generation, and not only that generation.  Morrison had the kind of voice one finds a few times every hundred years, and the ultimate tragedy is that he never gave himself the chance to nurture it to maturity.  A must, absolute must read for lovers of poetry that falls outside the pedestrian and comfortably middle class.valuations: vicious despair.

The George Jung we read about in Bruce Porter's book is a quite different one from the one played by Johnny Depp.  He's a lot smarter (while not exactly being a genius), a lot more greedy, and a lot tougher.  Plus, anyone enamored of the movie will be starstruck by the level of embellishment Ted Demme indulged in while making it.  Jung never stopped dealing, even after he basically got a \\"get out of jail free\\" card for testifying against Carlos Lehder (Diego in the movie), a sinister megalomaniac who along with Jung basically introduced coke to the US.  There was no \\"one last run\\" for his daughter, who we only hear about a few times in the book in vague reveries of regret Jung has for all she had to witness in his \\"glory days\\".  Mirtha was not quite the ruthless bitch Penelope Cruz played, and seemed to have stuck by Jung through quite a bit.  The book is essentially a repetitive documentation of drug smuggle after drug smuggle, until Jung gets way too comfortable and dipping into his own stash all the time.  He just doesn't know when to calm down.  Soon, he's so fried that he starts bragging to undercover cops and taking them under his wing as fellow smugglers, and so of course getting busted.<br /><br />For all this, Jung is no ruthless monster like many of the people we see him associate with.  He's actually kind of a middle class goofball who had a business mind and weird determination to never be poor, which may have stemmed from his childhood (who cares? that's no excuse.) He seems to have had quite a bit of intellect and could have been successful at something other than his purely destructive occupation.  He simply chose his own path and paid for it.  He gets out of jail after he should have gone away forever, starts dealing weed again, and then goes away for good.  There's no heartbreaking twist to any of this, just one man's greed getting the best of him.  This is a sad story not for Jung but for his daughter, his wife, and his father, who also seems to have seen some good in him the whole way through.

Simic's tone is flippant and unmistakably poetic; he can take the most ordinary situation and make a slick, subtle metaphysical comment about it (\\"On the Sagging Porch\\" is one of the best examples of this, as he takes a local president of the SPCA in a few beautiful stanzas makes Judas out of him).  In fact he seems to have a better grasp of what the oft used and abused word \\"surreal\\" means then a lot of the original surrealists themselves; these poems are not word games or pretty images, but both employed into substantive, moving poetry that sticks to the mind.  I think this collection as much as \\"The World Doesn't End\\" deserved the Pulitzer Prize.  Anyone who loves challenging, consciousness altering poetry will become a devotee of Simic.	2004-11-15

His work is an odd kind of majesty, a masterful coagulation of the early decadents, the modernists, the beats, stellar figures like Rimbaud and Baudelaire, yet with a voice all his own.  He gracefully charts the map from humorous to solemn, sacred to profane, personal to universal without skipping a beat.  He is a magician of images, and in the tradition of his predecessors weds seamlessly the most disconnected visions: \\"The ambulance passes/we sit up/pinned eyes of nuns that genuflect between stars/ambassadors on marble staircases in steam tropics...\\"Midnight\\" pg. 80).  After having read \\"The Basketball Diaries\\" I feared that Carroll's poetry would be bitching and whining over his checkered and painful past, but nothing could be further from the truth.  He seems to take the attitude of a grateful warrior to his time spent shooting dope, losing the friends he pays homage to without self pity: (\\"Some detectives in worn suits slide at my door/They told me Eddie was dead on Lexington and 103/stabbed in the jugular at mid-day/outside two automated hospital doors/He often walked East Harlem after dark, high on reds, calling out the black man/And I salute you, my brother. \\"New York City Variations\\" pg. 183).<br /><br />Most of Carroll's poetry, though, is the product of his own imagination and only refers to his youth when necessary.  He is obviously aware, though, of the parallels drawn between his and the chaotic life of Arthur Rimbaud with his enchanting prose pieces like \\"Rimbaud Goes To the Dentist\\".  For all that he is not capitalizing on the success of \\"Basketball\\": you know just from reading the first few (\\"The Blue Pill\\", \\"The Distances\\") poems that Carroll would have become famous just by virtue of his talent and not his sordid autobiography.<br /><br />This is a must for those who love raw, genuine poetry.>This is a must for those who love raw, genuine poetry.	2004-10-12

The other reviewers who claim that Jack Kerouac advanced somehow or became a better writer are simply wrong.  \\"Orpheus Emerged\\" is all one needs to read to understand Jack's ever present \\"on the edge\\" mentality.  And I found it enjoyable.  One character (we might as well call him Burroughs, since that's who he was) stands out among this seriously jaded crowd of people as the only one with guts enough to adhere to his somewhat loopy and wild notions of life.  He constantly quotes Rimbaud among the most dismal scenes, which I found inspiring and pretentious at the same time.  The women in Kerouac's works are exceptionally strong and, paradoxically put up with the worst kind of men imaginable.  This is exhilarating in the same way as \\"Fight Club\\" is exhilarating: so over the top and doe eyed rebellious that one has to love it.

Genet transcends the stereotype of \\"the literary prisoner\\" and does justice to Rimbaud's famous cry of revolt: \\"I admire the criminal on whom the prison bars close again and again.\\"  He paints the cretins with whom he is incarcerated with stunning beauty.  His idealization of the the \\"dregs\\" of society works well, and never falls into pretentiousness.  The way in which his fellow criminals lament their fate is astounding, and one wonders whether Genet took a little artistic license with the affair.  One young man exclaims: \\"Wow!  They really did a number on me.  Hard labor for life.\\"  With somewhat homoerotic overtones, Genet looks on all these young hoodlums with the tender pity of a mother for her child.<br /><br />Of course, Genet knows that his \\"negation of reality\\" and his willing descent into the underworld is little more than a wistful illusion which cannot last.  The pimps, thieves, and addicts he idealizes so beautifully are merely pimps, thieves and addicts.  His celebration of evil as the ultimate form of beauty goes from being believable to being absurd.  The idea of Genet having been the embodiment of Sartre's philosophy seems petty in retrospect, as Genet's work has held more water than Sartre's.  Sartre's dimestore psychoanalysis, laced with faux pas Marxism and some pastiche ideas he lifted from better thinkers, was never enough to explain any human being, let alone Jean Genet.  I suppose it was good Sartre was so obsessed with him, though, as Genet would have gone away for life had Sartre and the existentialist crew not showed up at his trial.<br /><br />Do not miss out on this.xistentialist crew not showed up at his trial. <br />Do not miss out on this.	2004-09-24

It is, they say, H.P. Lovecraft's purely subjective enthusiasms for certain writers and nothing more.  But this study is far more than a novelty, or an interesting peek into the mind of an exceedingly strange man.  If anyone ever did, H.P. Lovecraft knew horror from the inside out; and the racism notwithstanding (there is a disclaimer on the back of the book, so if it really bothers you that much, DON'T BUY IT) Lovecraft's assessments of Poe, Benson, Bierce and some other greats are so hard hitting and effective BECAUSE they are indeed so subjective.  And I don't think it's asking too much to simply ignore when he goes on a rant about how this or that writer had \\"good blood\\", or came from this or that race.  Lovecraft's prejudice is abundantly clear in the most celebrated of his works, so one must assume the Lovecraftian has already transcended this idiosyncratic nonsense to find the all pervasive feeling of dread at the bottom of his work.  If you're going to write horror, forget all the petty qualms people have with this little gem, and read it more than once.	2004-09-24

Johann Nagel, a dandyish/genius/maniac/ romeo type in a yellow coat, wanders from the eternal Nowhere into a small town, destroys all it's pretensions, and returns to the eternal Nowhere in the end, his suicide a protest against complacency of any kind.  There are scenes in this novel which I simply cannot forget, such as when Nagel brings the town's hypocritical intellectual circle to the point of mortal desperation simply by his presence.  He befriends a pathetic hunchback and teaches him how to assert himself.  He simultaneously attracts and repulses the town's women with his pledges of undying love and bizarre subconscious visions.  Hamsun is on a plane with Hesse and \\"Mysteries\\" is as good, if not better, than \\"Steppenwolf\\".  The vial of Prussic acid he carries in his coat is a symbol for the dangerous line we are treading in Western Civilization.  This is a dark descent into the mind of a complete outsider.  I agree with another reviewer in that this has the subtlety and terror of a Greek tragedy.  Hamsun treats his frenetic character with the compassion of a mother with a newborn child, but does not romanticize him a bit.  Unforgettable.	2004-09-17

Some of his \\"Unrealities\\" blend poetic word salads with ingenious covert metaphor: (\\"be these haunters of dreams always demurely half smiling from cool faces..\\") Cummings outdoes the beats with his crazed verbal exhortations to life.

His 'metaphysics of absence' is not as important as the dark, incandescent images he creates while employing it.  (Just a few pages and one knows he spent too much time around Daumal.) Despite his constant references to 'eternity' and that sort of thing, he is unsanctimonious and irreverent in his approach.  \\"What a Howling Shame\\" paints the poet as both friend and enemy of technology and the modern world: \\"From the phantom of spunk/the spirit of flint/ and the spectre of steel/a magic instrument/ of incalculable shamanic and poetic value.\\"  Lecomte's world is like a shadowy funhouse mirror.  The poet's exhilarating self reflection in \\"I'm Not Scared of Wind\\" is reminiscent of Rimbaud: \\"You bring things that would be doomed the most flat footed inertia madly alive/ You engender major phantoms and fits of the willies/You dervish clown/You kind of change/You rascal/You excessive cherub.\\"  It's surprising that Lecomte's poetry isn't better known.

It opens innocently enough, with budding artist Unica Zurn describing her childhood visions.  By turns ecstatic, horrific, depressing and extremely strange, the clash between imagination and reality which Zurn experiences first hand is riveting.  Her delusions (the Dadaist poets planning to liberate her from a mental ward, for example) are so manically inspired and magical that they genuinely achieve what so few of the surrealists could: the destruction of the boundary between fantasy and the world as we know it.<br /><br />Zurn walks the tightrope of delirium with alarming grace, at times unwittingly raiding the hazardous realms of deramgement which Breton and the gang could only admire from the outside: \\"As she returns to her hotel she allows herself to be directed once more by the voice within, telling her the way.  She lies down on the bed in her room and, as already for several nights, is unable to sleep.  Suddenly the stove starts to emit smoke--the smell gives  her the impression that a shady, dubious unknown surgeon is preparing to conduct a hideous operation which she must escape at all costs.  She leaves her room, closing the corridor and opens the first door.  The room is empty\\" (pg 53).  Wow.<br /><br />In the course of the narrative Zurn quite literally LIVES the surrealist manifesto as very few of the group ever did--casually pouring a cup of water on a policeman's hat, relying on an invisible Henri Michaux for support while witnessing the horror of life in the numerous mental hospitals she is forced into, and allowing the mathematical anagrams she is constantly writing to make many pivotal decisions in her life.  Unlike many surrealist pieces, however, this is not all word games and defiant pretension; Zurn's frenzied exaltation is taken apart piece by piece.<br /><br />Zurn peers out from the veil of convulsive beauty with the fortunate or unfortunate aid of psych meds and the result is tragic disillusionment.  She becomes a mere mortal, no longer wishing to see hallucinations.  Zurn's leap from a sixth floor window is as much a challenge to the surrealist quest as Nadja's psychosis and Nerval swinging from a lamppost.  It seems that the degree of ferocity with which the surrealist pioneers and legends embraced the fantastic at the cost of the mundane an equally ferocious psychical toll is suffered when they return to earth.  Still, this is a masterpiece which should be right up there with \\"Paris Peasant\\" and \\"Liberty or Love!\\"  I read this in one night and could not get over it.

In the tradition of Beckett or Kafka (with a little Marquez), Buzzatti employs the fantastic in the service of philosophy. Unlikely situations abound (such as the one in which each prisoner serving a life sentence is given the opportunity to make a speech to the public which, depending on the crowd's reaction, will set him free or keep him imprisoned for life) and in some of stories the name &quot;Dino&quot; is even used directly, as though the author were writing directly about himself. Buzzatti is also obsessed with the Devil (who, in the peron of a dark angel of death, gives Albert Einstein the congrats for his groundbreaking work.)

His cohorts' names are often as ludicrous as the fruitless, ominous adventures they embark upon; but for some reason I liked this better than Kerouac's &quot;On the Road&quot;. There's something more sincere about it. Think of it as &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot; of an earlier generation with a little more art thrown into it.<br /><br /> We get a sense of Gnossos early in the tale as a young man with something to prove, his philosophy of Exemption--complete individuality, maintaining his cool in the face of extreme adversity--bringing him into closer and closer contact with the authorities as the novel goes on. He consistently defies tradition, morality, and all forms of institutional orthodoxy through pranks, his obsession with criminals and 'degenerates' of every sort, mind-expansion (and, let's face it, simple drug abuse) through hallucinogens. For all his heroic and daring qualities, however, Gnossos is not a nice guy. He screws a girl with a fiancee, unblinkingly telling her that he is wearing a condom when he is not, and handing her an enema bag after he is done. He is abrasive and unnecessarily cruel, giving the finger to every person he sees simply because he fails to get laid in one scene. All the while, though, his desperate search for 'something more' comes across even as his darker and more despicable qualities surface. The ending is shocking and sad, but predictable. Pynchon's introduction is telling about the actual Farina.<br /><br /> One of the only beat novels I'd take the time to read.	2004-08-04

One definitely does not have to be a genius to understand this, one only has to read with sometimes excruciating attention. While it would take hours to get into the entire plot, the whole thing reeks of both Cold War Traumatic Syndrome and idiosyncratic genius. We are taken on a consciousness trip, admittedly sometimes all over the place, by an author who is looking toward the apocalypse. If Stanley Kubrick had possessed literary talent, he may have produced a book similar to this one.<br /><br /> This guy gets a hard on every time a V-bomb hits, and the entire planet lies in ruins. It is a sort of 'ghetto sci-fi' novel, a great Twilight Zone episode replete with pornography and some of the worst human instincts imaginable.

Rarely does a day go by without me thinking of Rilke's Nietzschean, no-holds-barred philosophy of the real poet.  For him, a poet is no simply one who writes verses or rhymes words: it is a different kind of human being who embraces not only beauty and happinesss but suffering and misfortune.  His thoughts on solitude are absolutely indispensable.  Any artist or aspiring artist who has ever been in a fruitless relationship (&quot;loss of the self&quot; is a theme he explores almost obsessively) will realize that Rilke is writing through experience on the necessity of a good amount of solitude, both spiritual and physical, to create art.  He is achingly honest to the poet with whom he is conversing, and passionately sincere.  He knows that not every poet is a poet, and that some will find the Promethean task far too exhausting to actually go through with it: the real artist is the one who has no choice in the matter.  His inner demons or angels will not ALLOW him to stop writing.  Bukowski's thoughts on the matter are similar, as are most major writers and artist.  This is a demanding, unforgiving collection of letters.  Rilke has no patience for weakness or dilly dallying.  But it is more inspiring than any self-help book on the shelf.  This should be nationally distributed, not only for artists but for human beings as a whole.	2004-07-12

Jacopo Ortis, a young romantic (Romantic with a capital R, as you'll see) manages to wallow whole heartedly in every imaginable feeling of alienation, exile, painful love, pessimism regarding man and nature, suicide, weakness that he can muster-- and muster them he does in his venomous letters to his friend.  From the beginning, we realize that this guy isn't going to be around long. A love affair (not unrequited, surprisingly enough) with a woman named Teresa drives him to the extremities of self hatred, self recrimination, and self destruction.  He alternately claims that all society is constructed on illusion, and yet goes on page-length rants about the singular beauty of Italy and its unjust occupation by whoever.  In the tradition of Leopardi, he dissects every human belief as comforting illusion, all while feeling that there are sufficient reasons for him to off himself and exalting morality. Jacopo is a confused guy, but manages to cast a strange spell over others--Teresa's father, for instance.  He exudes the sanctimonious air of a priest.  This is literature, of course.<br />The end is predictable.  It is truly a touching work, but there is a point past which Jacopo's rantings become both depressing and annoying.  Now we know why Nietzsche couldn't stand Rosseau.  Still, there is a delicious self indulgent, tragic touch to it.	2004-07-12

HG Wells, a man who spent most of his life penning works such as &quot;Ye Shall Be As Gods&quot; and optimistic science fiction, suddenly did a frightening 360.  For centuries, Wells tells us, human genius has been looking for something beyond the realm of the everyday, something essential--in short, something meaningful.  The unreal character of human life is made abundantly clear in Wells' almost bitter, certainly disillusioned tone.  &quot;There is no way out or round or through,&quot; Wells tells us with complete assurance.  Not only is there no hope, hope itself is merely an illusion that arrived with human consciousness.<br />While this might not be for everyone, it is certainly fascinating for those who know the 'lifelong' Wells or remember Orson Welles excitedly reading &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; over network radio to much acclaim.

At times the pitch of intensity reached in his tales is actually frightening.  The stories themselves, yes, lack focus and often degenerate into subjective meanderings, but this only bespeaks of the artist's state of mind.  His obsession with &quot;the other&quot; or &quot;the shadow&quot; seems to have been his overwhelming desire to enter the realm of the imaginary, the aesthetic, entirely.  His narrators are, like Bernhard's (but more so) seriously messed up people voicing their misanthropy in sometimes unintelligible, sometimes intelligible ways.  Most end up killing themselves or someone else.  All are extremely anti-social and despise the contented, even revering murderers and drug addicts over 'normal' people.  One will be left with a paradoxically tasty distate in one's mouth after reading these stories, and will gain a clear understanding of why this disturbed man ended up dead at 26 years old.	2004-06-30

Eric and Dylan were two young men who, in the throes of alienation and despair, combined their legitimate rage at constant mistreatment into an excuse for a quite illegitimate reaction, the vicious murder of 13 other young people.  Eric (who Brown seems to feel was disturbed from the getgo) and Dylan, whom Brown suffered through junior high with, became progressively more hateful toward not only the group of morons harassing them at school but humanity in general.  We are given some insight into their deteriorating minds when Brown recounts an instance in which they shot a little children with bebe guns on Halloween night--and laughed about it.<br />If Eric and Dylan had simply been evil sociopaths, Columbine as culture shock would be easier to absorb, simply a glitch.  But this was not the case.  While Eric had anger problems and Dylan was clearly predisposed to violence from a certain age, these tendencies seem to have emerged from two boys who had been rejected one too many times.<br />To my mind at least, this eyewitness narrative takes us right back to the original feelings about Columbine when it occured, that these were two isolated and abhorred young men with something horrific to prove.  All the convoluted nonsense about 'fame' goes out the window.  This, Brown aptly comments, serves the authorities well in their sweeping dismissal of the idea that something might have actually been wrong with their little community to begin with.  The psychological trauma of the incident on Brown is probably indescribable and, to an extent, irreversible.  He is commendable, however, for reaching through the haze of mediated lies and excuses to deliver truth in this heartwrenching tale of two boys who degenerated from kids with extreme potential to hopeless murderers.trauma of the incident on Brown is probably indescribable and, to an extent, irreversible.

After reading the first few paragraphs of &quot;Wittgenstein's Nephew&quot;, I knew I had misjudged the man's writing beforehand.  This is not so much Schopenhauer or Cioran as it is Ionesco or Gombrowicz; there is an element of humor in Bernhard's work (although not overt) which exposes the comedy of human existence in a comedic, rather than depressing and foreboding, way.<br />Bernhard's narrator is a close friend with Paul Wittgenstein, nephew of the famous philosopher.  Paul, while as brilliant and analytical as his prestigious nephew, is unfortunately quite insane and completely misanthropic.  Bernhard takes pains to highlight the fact that Paul, despite his pronounced writers' block and inability to produce anything (except a few scattered memoirs, which are apparently destroyed before his death), is as much of a giant as his nephew.  The absurdity of life surrounds the two friends, as they are both incarcerated for more-or-less terminal illnesses, the narrator's being physical, Paul's being mental.  We watch the sad deterioration of this once outgoing genius to a raving maniac, unable to pass a homeless man without giving away his life savings.  The narrator describes his nearly inescapable feelings of hopelessness as his troubled friend Paul responds to everything with a disturbing:<br />&quot;Grotesque, grotesque.&quot;<br />The narrator hates nature, and here we are reminded of Huysmans.  His descriptions of the 'walks' he is recommended to take (&quot;I was never a walker&quot;) arouse in him nothing but the most repulsed feelings.  Bernhard's writing sometimes reminds one of Schopenhauer's essays; once he or his character voices an emotion or thought on human existence, they feel the need to repeat it five thousand times in five thousand different ways.  In Schopenhauer, this is merely annoying.  In Bernhard, it is funny.<br />The ending is the saddest part of the novel. The narrator, out of a &quot;sickening instinct of life preservation,&quot; avoids his friend. He appears psychotic and talks of nothing but death.  Paul, hated by his family (along with his nephew, the two are the familial outcasts), decides to play a &quot;prank&quot; which does not go over well.  The last line by the narrator is crushing: &quot;I have not visited his grave to this day.&quot;unny.<br />The ending is the saddest part of the novel.

It is a gripping, unputdownable novel of amazing power.  I would venture to say that Carneiro is more decadent, in his delirium, the complicated sadness and alienation of his characters, and subtle depravity than most of the big names--Beardsley, Verlaine, etc.<br />In this mind bogglingly perverse tale, a young man named Lucio is writing to us from prison.  Taking an attitude of resignation to his horrendous fate of life imprisonment, the lush prose grips from the beginning.  Obviously intelligent, Lucio seems to have no interest in demonstrating his innocence to the reader, since, according to him, his life &quot;ended&quot; long ago with his indulgence in the strongest pleasures and pains life has to offer.  One could interpret the following events in any number of ways, but the operant word here really is perverse; his artist friend, a happy poet named Ricardo who is unable to feel &quot;affection&quot; for anyone, only &quot;tenderness&quot;, shacks up with a mysterious woman named Marta, whom Lucio becomes obsessed with.  There is no clear picture as to how Ricardo became involved with this beautiful woman, who she is, or where she comes from.  Painting her toenails gold and generally behaving in a completely uninhibited way, we are at no point given insight into WHO Marta actually is beneath the veneer (or is it?) of complete anonymity.  This, as Lucio confesses, is his only real attraction to the woman; her complete inaccessibility.  After nearly losing his mind in obsession over this woman, he suddenly begins an affair with her.  Again, Marta's motives are without explanation.  At first Lucio is concerned that his friend might notice, but he does not.  In fact, and this is where the 'insanity' per se really begins, Ricardo seems oblivious to Marta's behavior with others entirely.  In one scene Marta demands that Lucio kiss her forehead right in front of Ricardo, and he does.  Ricardo then exclaims, along with Marta, that this was not a 'real' kiss, and kisses his friend full on the lips.<br />Hmm.<br />Confusion of identity is paramount here.  While Lucio does not feel ingratiated enough with Ricardo to refer to him as &quot;tu&quot;, meaning friend, he does so accidentally--because this is what he calls Marta.  Lucio begins to descend into dementia, such is the power of the bizarre situation over his sensitive mind.  He begins describing a dark, grey cloud which does not allow him to remember things, and occasionally comments that he is never sure if he has kissed or embraced Marta at all.  He makes an effort to forget the entire distasteful affair, flees Paris and begins the finishing act on his play &quot;The Flame&quot;.  It is denounced by the impresario of the theater as nonsense, although Lucio considers it his best work.  Here again we see Lucio's radical divorce from reality.  More than once he is asked by acquaintances whether he is &quot;cracking up.&quot;<br />The ending is a terrifying series of seemingly inexplicable events which land Lucio in prison for life.  I won't ruin it for other readers, but I think the appropriate term here is &quot;creepy ambiguity.&quot;  Was Marta a delusion, a product of Ricardo's brilliant mind invented for the express purpose of driving others to insane depths of obsession?  Or was Marta a real woman Ricardo 'assimilated' in order to relieve his overwhelming sense of loneliness?  We are left with a troubling question mark that Carneiro probably left deliberately. Lucio's is a tragic destiny made all the more horrific by its inexplicability.  He himself does not understand entirely what occured.<br />While many 'decadent' works serve only to shock and titillate sensually, I would venture to say that Carneiro has a real message here, albeit an unpleasant one.  He raises unanswerable questions in a strangely compelling way.  The unfathomable nature of human relations, their selfish nature, the tenuous character of identity, etc.  If David Lynch were to have written a book ages ago, it would have been something like this.

The analysis of his 'poetry' is pedestrian, nothing special.  I gave it three stars because there are some amusing stories and hitherto untold tales about Artaud's bizarre exploits toward the end of his life.  All in all, though, a disappointment.	2004-06-16

It is strange and slightly demented, but these qualities seem only to add to the overall quality.  If one were to be in a peculiar state of mind and smoke opium, the result would be something like this.  The protagonist is a sick, solitary misanthrope who suffers from what seem to be hallucinations of an old man with a turban with a horrifying laugh (this is repeated over and over again, like some kind of mantra) and a beautiful woman our anti-hero is fixated on.  He persistently refers to his wife as \\"the bitch\\", but seems to love her dearly despite her infidelity and disdain of him.  Hedayat's character is both self loathing and world loathing, preferring to his hypnagogic visions and sickly existence to 'real' life.  He no longer makes distinctions between sanity and insanity.  He finds a woman's body chopped up (it seems) and does not tell the police.  By the end of this novel, really a series of incomprehensible happenings spliced with some bitter comments on humanity, we have come to understand him as a lucid but self divided man losing his mind.  This is a must.	2004-06-13

Vadim does not actually use cocaine until the end of the novel ('the beginning of the end', as it were) and the novel is mostly composed of his Dostoevskian self loathing and inability to relate to his peers on any level.  It is almost an exercise in depressive solipsism; while Vadim's peers play a large role in the novel his inner world is so tortured and miles apart from them that the author might as well have portrayed him as a complete misanthrope.  In the opening we get a feel for where his moral compass is swinging; he gives a venereal disease to a young woman in full cognizance of what he is doing.  He agonizes over it, but this does not prevent him from actually doing it.  The most catching scenes in the novel are when his classmates, thrown into a kind of cocaine induced revolt against the orthodoxy of the school they attend, verbally attack priests and teachers.  Burkewitz, a character we encounter later in the book, gives a particularly interesting speech to the headmaster priest of the school in the middle of a sermon.  There are thoroughly disturbing scenes; Vadim strikes his mother, steals from her, all the while recognizing her basic goodness and frail attempts to relate to him. Vadim wants to consider himself exceptional, a unique student and son, and at the same time loathes himself.  Many of his self evaluations strike a schizoid note.  His entrance into the world of cocaine use is preceded by his rejection of a girl with whom he was too fearful to consummate his relationship.  Like everyone else, she has a false image of him and rejects him entirely when he fails to live up to it.  We are only given blurry pictures of the lengths to which he goes to obtain cocaine after a few seamy scenes in which his 'friends' instruct him in the mechanics of use.  &quot;My son is a thief&quot;, his mother wails.  Vadim's disturbing coke dreams are not of the usual variety; far from being visions of grandiosity, they are unconscious and violent recognitions of his own guilt and wretchedness.  I wouldn't hesitate to say that this is one of the most bizarre novels I have ever encountered.  It oscillates between philosophy, self loathing and insanity, and does not strike an even balance.  I would recommend it to anyone, not for knowledge of a cocaine addict's world (this is not a realistic depiction) but as a jolting primer for any study or enjoyment of  the literature of decadence.My son is a thief&quot;, his mother wails.

Despite the sometimes condescending comparisons made between LIgotti's work and Cardin's, I would say that Cardin is more in the vein of William Peter Blatty or Georg Heym than Ligotti himself.  Cardin clearly has more than a working knowledge of theology and all forms of spirituality, and his terror of the void shines through even in the biblical passages which he precedes his tales with.  In &quot;Notes of a Mad Coypist: The Monk's Answer&quot; Cardin's art reaches it's height.  A devout monk suddenly has what might be called a &quot;vastation&quot; of the most extreme sort which his contemporary monks mistake at first for a spiritual enlightment of sorts, and then recognize for what it is. Cardin carries St. John's &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; to a new level.  Any of us who have at one time gone mad with ideas or had deep, intuitive doubts about the reality (or 'goodness') of human existence will immediately recognize Cardin as a fortunate survivor of this indescribably painful and hopeless experience.  He has come out the other side to deliver dark juicies in the tradition of Grabinski, Andreyev, etc.  It would be interesting to know what Cardin's actual beliefs are, since the tales suggest a titanic struggle between Christian faith and absolute meaninglessness.  This is real horror.	2004-06-10

This powerful tome on struggle and suffering as a way to redemption was given to me as a gift by a fantastic Catholic author.<br /><br />Bernanos' main character, a country priest burning from the inside out with both discouragement and a seemingly unshakeable faith in personal redemption through Jesus Christ, encounters every form of doubt, despair, revolt and mediocrity as he endures his role as scandalous freak in a narrow, provincial town.  He encounters a young girl who despises her mother, the church, her weak and indulgent father, and who may have killed her baby brother as a child.  Flaming with rebellion and a desire to escape the town which is oppressing her, we see the young pastor's incredible power of faith and humility as he engages in truly frightening dialogues with her, trying to bring her back to faith and convince her to stay with her mother. \\"God will break you,\\" he insists.  The other priests the young pastor encounters are lackluster or despairing, not possessing a fraction of his energy and enthusiasm.  In a powerful scene one of the town peasants, in the midst of a heated dialogue with the ailing pastor, comments: \\"When you're dead, everythin's dead.\\"  Despite his obvious superiority to the parish in which he is working, he maintains a humble and even self deprecating attitude, wanting to appear far more common than he is.  The town gossips viciously about him and his relationship with the young girl and her mother who later commits suicide. Even the young pastor is not immune from doubts and frequent fits of despair, losing his ability to pray numerous times.  In the end, however, we discover that throughout the entire novel the young man has been suffering from stomach cancer, and after a few horrific scenes in which he pukes blood and faints, comes to accept his fate with what seems a certain relief.<br /><br />The incredible thing about Bernnanos' character is that he is utterly human and so are the other characters in the novel: there is no sugar coating as in some many novels dealing with faith.  He encounters Darwinists, atheists, and feels the effects of their doubt upon him.  He is a thinker despite being a believer and rejects nothing out of hand.  The primary quality of the novel is a painful authenticity.  The ending is particularly touching, the pastor's last words to his friends' concern over his ailing state:<br /><br />\\"Does it matter?  Grace is everywhere\\"utterly human and so are the other characters in the novel: there is no sugar coating as in some many novels dealing with faith.

His Jesus Christ is actually less different than the traditional one he imagines people have erected, but a political, social and personal revolutionary who deliberately rebelled against the dangerous atmosphere of his times to convey his message of unconditional love.  Harvey harps far too much on his \\"Divine Feminine\\" concept, which while interesting is more idiosyncratic than relevant, but his enthusiasm for Christ's love of the disinherited, rebellious and suffering of all kinds is infectious.  While one may be up in the air as regards faith and the divine, this book is a necessity notwithstanding.  The quotes introducing each chapter are taken from the most diverse and obscure of sources, everyone from Boehme to Luther, Kempis to Griffiths.  I hope Harvey doesn't go haywire with the the circle of believers he will undoubtedly attract and start some \\"Cosmic Christ\\" cult.	2004-05-28

The author continually contradicts himself and sometimes what he is trying to say is entirely inaccessible:he condemns &quot;the Devil's contemplatives&quot; who seem to view bodily sensations and the exhilaration of the senses as some sign of God's approval in their discipline.  And then, a chapter later, he will approve of certain sensate phenomena as true signs of God.  This could be merely the confusion of a novice, but I would say the anonymous author approaches agnosticism with his view as the actual CONTACT we can have with God: &quot;the cloud of unknowing&quot; prevents it entirely, although we must &quot;beat upon it&quot; until, eh, something happens.  This is the path of spiritual darkness as a way to the Divine, which is indeed fascinating.  The author's recognition of the tenuous and error prone nature of human consciousness could be seen as a precusor to the existentialist view of human life.  I would recommend reading St. John of the Cross first, but have fun with this one.  Who knows, maybe the whole thing will make perfect sense to me one day.  But I doubt it.	2004-05-28

In the tradition of Maupassant, Schopenhauer and Trakl, Heym employs dark poetic atmosphere to reveal the futility of human effort and obsesses over life's horrors (in an entertaining, exhilarating way.) Hallucinatory imagery abounds as Heym's wretched, often deranged narrators commit atrocities, believing themselves to be in another state of being then they actually are (case in point: &quot;The Madman&quot;).  I'm thinking that Heym's poetry must be in the vein of Brennan, Leopardi, and the more bleak parts of Dante.  These tales, however, are not to be taken in large doses for most.  Definitely recommended if you're looking for something discouraging, odd and exciting all at once.	2004-05-28

The cover itself held my attention: a deranged, \\"Deliverancesque\\" face grimacing at the jagged orange lines which gave us a clue into the psyche of the protagonist, or rather the anti-protagonist.  Along with Kubrick's blurb (I couldn't imagine a better or more believable \\"sociopathic\\" narrative than the one Kubrick offered in his classic \\"Clockwork\\") I envisioned in my mind a seedy novel which detailed the gleeful rampage of a madman with a badge.<br />I was dead wrong.  Not only is this not your typical \\"I'm actually a twisted (...) and no one knows it\\" piece of fiction, Thompson's murderer is in actuality as mind numbingly complex as the beautifully simple, commonplace mentality in which he writes.  Lou Ford is a town sherrif with seemingly honest sensibilities, hardline values, and a great deal of empathy for the downtrodden and disinherited.  Striking his fellow townspeople as a warm, somewhat monotonous but ever reliable upholder of the law, Ford's slow and fascinating downfall reveals the inner world of a man who is not so much a ruthless killer as a conflicted psychopath attempting to grasp his own identity (which he does not have) within the circumference of his surroundings and by turns tender and vicious relationships with the opposite sex.  The brutal scenes in which he coldly calculates and executes those who 'stand in his way' (including women who are seemingly ignorant of 'the sickness' right up until the bloody end) are so divergent from the rest of his narrative that the reader is genuinely shocked and frightened.  Ford displays not so much a facade to others as a pathetic 'do gooder' mentality which he needs to conceal the fact that not only does he lack much emotion of any kind, but that the other side of his split/schizoid personality could emerge at any moment.<br />Ford's relationship with Johnnie Papas, the young town 'screw up' is perhaps the most poignant aspect of the entire novel.  On one level he seems to genuinely empathize with the young man's pitiable position in life, and we see understanding dialogues between the two characters; later, in the depths of the county jail, we see Lou bash his throat in after giving his 'real', chilling feelings about the world and Johnnie's honest but rough position in it.<br />In the last chapter, we see the 'other' Lou Ford full blown.  I won't ruin it for other readers, but I will say that it is undoubtedly one of the most chilling pieces of fiction I have ever read.ip with Johnnie Papas, the young town 'screw up' is perhaps the most poignant aspect of the entire novel.

His interviews are as enigmatic and mind boggling as ever, his brilliant essay (hilariously defaming the mystique of the vampire) and a few mild speculations on 'how Ligotti came to be Ligotti' make the book worth reading.  Anyone who is an avid fan of Ligotti will instantly recognize Matt Cardin's poignant essays, analysis of his stories, and longstanding interviews such as &quot;Disillusionment Can Be Glamorous&quot;.  Perhaps the highlight of the book is David Tibet's short but sweet essay on his personal relationship with Ligotti, including an excerpt from an amusing letter which Ligotti apparently wrote after watching the horrible &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;.  All in all, this is more than worth buying and putting in one's personal library along with Lovecraft's letters, Poe's stories, as are the rest of Ligotti's masterpieces.	2004-04-18

He himself says in &quot;Revolution&quot; that all important statements on human existence ended with the furious revolt of Lautreamont's inspiring creation of absolute rebellion, &quot;Maldoror&quot;. But thankfully he contradicted himself, here condemning not only Globalization as destructive and ultimately imprisoning to everyone on the planet, but defending such rights as &quot;The Right of the Human Being to Move and Think As He or She Sees Fit&quot;, &quot;The Right of the Human Being To Hold Nothing Sacred&quot;, so on.  He is more fierce in old age, suprisingly, than ever.  His unrelenting attack on the negative and ultimately suicidal forms of emotion as fear, hatred, authoritarianism and a plethora of other &quot;arms that chain us&quot; is written in the same lustful, lush prose as his texts of 68.  One can only hope (not pray) that someday Vaneigem's world vision will become our everyday existence.	2004-04-08

Like Nabokov, Ionesco found solace in his work as a refuge from the the basic meaninglessness of world events, politics, and in some ways even art itself.  In one passage he renounces Rimbaud's &quot;Illuminations&quot;, so far does he descend into the depths of skepticism.

Perhaps the only problem with his work is that it is being marketed in a culture directly inimical to it's message--as a Westerner, I have trouble inculcating his on-the-mark attacks simply because I am a Westerner.  Osho has written the same book countless times, and his message never becomes less relevant for the repetition.  He is a poet, philosopher and sage all at the same time, and his constant exhortation to 'drop the ego' could be characterized as the central message in his work.  The only thing I take issue with in his work is his persistent dismissal of culture's irrevocable (and sometimes irreversible) influence on the individual.  If one could simply 'drop out' of this mass neurosis a lot more intelligent people would have done it by now.  Nonetheless, his work is invaluable and I am certain that one day Osho's name will be up there with the greats of both literature, eastern thought and creativity.	2004-02-29

What piqued my interest in the book was his essay on &quot;Steppenwolf&quot;.  It disappointed me, because it is barely a page and a half, a unsatisfactory synopsis of his most personal (I believe) book.  When Hesse comes to mind I immediately think of &quot;Steppenwolf&quot; before the &quot;Glass Bead Game&quot;, &quot;Siddharta&quot;, or any of his other masterpieces.  Like Hamsun's &quot;Mysteries&quot; or Ingmar Bergman's film &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot;, perhaps it was simply too &quot;personal&quot; for him to go into.<br />The rest of the essays, however, reflect a meditative, open, imaginative mind free of prejudice.  I can't recall the exact name of the essay, but it has to do with bad poetry, and Hesse articulates a feeling that other lovers of poetry will immediately understand: that poems traditionally considered 'bad' often reflect our feelings in a less 'rhyme-scheme', formulaic way, and have a sort of tonic effect on the emotions.  Hesse was truly a revolutionary.	2004-02-25

I have no doubt of the sincerity of your belief that Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin were suffering from the exact 'disease' you diagnose them with, but referring me to *movies* (I think it would be appropriate here to distinguish between reality and cinema, particularly in the case of &quot;The Doors&quot;, an Oliver Stone carwreck containing so much misinformation and misportrayals of every character, particularly Morrison, that we can hardly rely on it as some objective portrayal of the bands', and by extension Jim's, life and times that in looking at the actual man and not the fantasy we should positively run the other way).  Shouldn't a psychotherapist discount films and souped up biographies to get to the real man as opposed to the myth?  &quot;The Rose&quot;, concerning Janis, while a better film, is still only a film.  That a licensed psychotherapist, psychologist, whatever could even think of invoking a movie to diagnose even a long dead &quot;patient&quot; is absurd to the point of insanity.<br />You speak as if you knew them personally, which clearly would not be possible. You probably read &quot;Break On Through&quot;, &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;, &quot;The Lizard King&quot;, etc, and took everything in them as gospel truth--at least that's how it seems from the inane spouting of the Cartoon Morrison in your &quot;interviews&quot;.  I am more than certain I know as much about the lives of these two legends as you do.  Yes, they were self destructive; yes, they used drugs extensively; yes, they played with different identities, different costumes.  No one will EVER know why.  This is precisely my point. Diagnosing them with Borderline Personality Disorder is about as solid as guessing what color shoes they wore from day to day.  It is, once and for all, subjective.  Your book is pure hypothesis, useful in the genre of hypothesis, but nothing more.  Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin were doubtless two individuals suffering on the inside; in this they are no different from many creative geniuses.  But to reduce their creativity to illness or twisted therapy accepted during a time of social turmoil is to stain their memory.  Your thoroughly distasteful reductionism (&quot;the facade of Morrison as poet began to crumble&quot;) is positively offensive to anyone who values his groundbreaking creativity.  Did you actually speak to their families?  Anyone who knew them as opposed to people making money from books and films?

His seeming determination to drive himself insane is a facade: he is actually a lonely man seeing the world through the filmy, pessimistic lens of a COMPLETELY lonely man.  When one is bereft of any contact beyond the slightest acquaintances, the most minute events become magnified to an absurd proportion and if anyone could get inside our heads for a matter of more than five minutes they would realize that something was grotesquely, horribly wrong.  Obsessive thought patterns often result from this kind of loneliness which is not only oppressive but all encompassing: it usually starts with social anxiety and blows up into a cartoonish nightmare of the most paltry sensations become gargantuan.  His joy over even the slightest contact with another human being is pathetic indeed, but revelatory of his complete isolation.  I would not agree that this is manic depression or anything of the sort, but Hamsun's masterful articulation of the oscillating moods which occur when a human being becomes neurosis itself and fears everything.  Hamsun has accomplished in this novel what centuries of literature have been unable to do: to articulate the inarticulate.

Cooper is speaking not only to our conscious, intellectual or philosophical selves--he is tapping into the subconscious.<br />&quot;Openness means pain, and, despite attentive kindness and help and clarification that one may get from other people, the pain ultimately has to be suffered alone. It is from this position of solitude that the ultimate clarification must come.  Make no mistake about it, other people will always sense, even without realizing what they sense, when someone in the group has been through this sort of self confrontation.  It would be fatuous to speak of communes without the presence in the group of, in the first instance, at least the person who has rigorously enough dealt with his life in these terms (pg 46).&quot;<br />Confident enough to generalize here, I would say that anyone who denies the singular brilliance of this passage has thrown the baby out with bathwater--that is, they unconsciously deny the very real kind of liberation Cooper writes of before actually reading the book. (Case in point: Reviewer Number One).<br />Cooper goes onto illustrate the System of Guilt so prevalent in our society, which prevents any true self realization and condemns us to a life of stagnation and mechanical responses engendered by fear. Cooper has the intuitive, not only intellectual, honesty to understand and admit the nearly insufferable pain which results from true self examination: abandonment, despair, the whole host of human emotions which absolutely must be worked through lest we endanger our chances of self realization.  Like the greatest of revolutionary authors, he exhorts us to dissolve the self-image, which now (far more so than when Cooper wrote this) governs our society and the better part of our day to day behavior, insulating us within walls which one day, if we persist in our neurotic non-communication, may become insurmountable.<br />Yes, of course: the talk of communes and Marxism are no longer relevant. Some of this is a time piece, and some it rivals and even surpasses the work of oft-touted 60's gurus like Herbert Marcuse, R.D. Laing, and (of course) Timothy Leary.

Carroll's &quot;8 Fragments for Kurt Cobain&quot; is a really moving piece, and if you have any knowledge of the subject you will feel something shift inside you while reading it, and a deep disappointment that it ends at all.

(\\"i have nofing, nofing!\\") while pnin is a mostly comical character (intended, i think, to represent in his slightest characteristics, our embarrassing and futile attempts to control what cannot be controlled or understood--life). perhaps the most significant and telltale part of the novel is in the beginning--nabokov frankly admits the pessimism and sense of the absurd running throughout the tale, confessing that he \\"hates happy ending\\".  he is speaking for not only a certain kind of reader but a certain kind of human being, the kind that never feels comfortable with sugar coated takes on human life, in literature or otherwise.  beautiful and heart rending, not to be missed within this lifetime.	2004-01-02

(although i'm sure he would hate me for calling him any of those things.) ultimately, he is himself, and this should be enough for us to change our lives completely. vaneigem wants no following, no idolatry; he wants what everyone really wants, change. vache, cravan, all the great dada and surrealist rebels are quoted at length in this impassioned tome which will only grow more and more important with age-actually, it really doesn't age.  it is the NOW sitting in front of our eyes at every moment of every day embodied in a book. everyone in the world should read this book.	2003-09-10

It is in the tradition of Rimbaud, the poet as deranged rebel and tortured visionary, and Reed is clearly not pretending.  &quot;Outsiders&quot; is one of his most iconoclastic pieces, and perhaps more than any other poem in the collection expresses his credo.  It is also, despite very upbeat imaginative trips, very dark material: Reed is not praising the felicities and trivial joys of life so much as reaching for its core in his urgent, existential fashion.  Some of the most haunting poems are dedications to his deceased friends who were obviously as committed to his 'live on the edge' philosophy as he is.  There is no posturing involved, and it would not surprise me at all if in twenty or thirty years &quot;Reed&quot; is mentioned in the same breath as &quot;Artaud&quot;.	2003-08-14

I'd like to qualify that statement by frankly admitting that I do not like the translator.  His introduction is arrogant, prickly, and self promoting.  Mason seems bent on convincing us that every image ever created of Rimbaud, the passionate and vicious young poet from Charleville, are all simply projections and fantasies.  While I've obviously seen this from many translators concerning many figures, Mason pulls it off with more pretentiousness than usual.  &quot;I don't want the reader to come away with his or her own Rimbaud,&quot; he says.  As if that were possible:as if it were not part of the creative process to take away our own impressions of a poet or artist.  Truth be told, there is very little ambiguity as regards the interpretation of Rimbaud's life: it was a vicious search for the absolute through any means necessary, sadly abandoned through poetic burn out.  Mason's form of analytical pomposity is nothing other than the desire to destroy the passion inherent in Rimbaud's life and works by casting doubt on his memory and talent.  That said, the translations are catastrophic and deserving of praise, &quot;The Drunken Boat&quot; in particular.  The poems speak for themselves.  In short, listen to Rimbaud, not Mason.	2003-02-07

In &quot;Third From the Sun&quot; Matheson tells a sad tale of a family trying to escape a planet about to self destruct.  This really is horror in its purest form: it reflects the quakes and ruptures beneath everyday life without making them look absurd, costume like, or obvious.  It is subtle and disturbing.

The best in this collection is perhaps Benjamin Peret, the most uncompromising surrealist of them all.  His work is completely recalcitrant to mundane reality, forcing it to become magical and, of course, surreal.  Admittedly, some of these writers are difficult to penetrate, but the effort is certainly worth it.  Jarry especially.	2003-02-05

 wilson puts such an emphasis on the importance of the individual will as the chief determinant of how much meaning or the reverse an individual feels he or she possesses in their life, and yet the individual will means little indeed when we are headed for the morgue.  the ubermensch, for all his accomplishment and 'self actualization', is going to buy the farm like everyone else.  wilson claims that the work of wilhelm reich was based on a fallacy, that of the freudian sexual theory, and he is right, but one could say just as legitimately that wilson's life work is also based on a fallacy, the fallacy of avoidance!  after all, isn't this the dilemma that camus, sartre, and kafka made us aware of, the relativity of all human actions in the face of death? wilson obsesses over these authors and claims to harbor the same doubts about the reality of our existence, but seems quite content to write them off as gloomy pessimists who never realized that after a jog, darn we feel good. the thinkers that wilson lambasts as not taking into account the 'absurd good news', our periods of joy and creativity in fact experienced precisely what wilson claims they were ignorant of, but they looked at things as one is supposed to in philosophy, the human condition as a whole. he slams the romantics for not realizing that the moments of life affirmation and wonder they felt were necessarily more objective than the periods of misery and decadence because the former is a 'bird's eye view' of life and the world whereas the latter is the 'worm's eye view', but wilson seems to forget that the bird's eye view is still doomed to be torn away from us, just like everything else, by death. his idol george bernard shaw was not quite the christlike figure wilson imagines him to have been, and senses the same insistence in his work on purpose and underlying meaning where any idiot can see that there doesn't seem to be any. although i still feel his work has value, it seems like more of a dogma to me now than philosophy, a dogma of suspect optimism and happy happy joy joy.morgue.  the ubermensch, for all his accomplishment and 'self actualization', is going to buy the farm like everyone else.  wilson claims that the work of wilhelm reich was based on a fallacy, that of the freudian sexual theory, and he is right, but one could say just as legitimately that wilson's life work is also based on a fallacy, the fallacy of avoidance!  after all, isn't this the dilemma that camus, sartre, and kafka made us aware of, the relativity of all human actions in the face of death?

'will to power' rhetoric aside, nietzsche was, in the final equation, anti authoritarian, although he never would have admitted it.<br />taking these substantial flaws into consideration, this is still an immensely important book and one that will be read by those self educators of philosophy who yearn to understand the 'why' of existence.' of existence.	2002-03-25

Although a flawed and decidedly ambivalent man, Breton was the first out and out surrealist worthy of the name, seeking the spirit of magic and 'immanent transcendence' of a sort in the marvelous, a sense of mysticism and wonder in no way supernatural or otherworldly. Breton exhorts us to break the sterile and suffocating chains of rationalism and logic, and to realize the relativity of perspectives and perceptions of reality, thereby freeing both our intellect and the supreme weapon of the human mind, the imagination. The surrealist lifestyle is nothing if not a furious attempt at total liberation, and Breton knows that this cannot be said often enough. The mad, the imaginative, the dreamy and the alienated are true 'surrealists' and unwittingly live this defiant philosophy of rebellion through their resolute refusal to conform to society's norms and to replace their own thoughts with those of the uninspired, the average, the ordinary. The literary and poetic precursors Breton cites are absolutely perfect and in accordance with the ideology he is formulating:anyone who has deeply felt the power of imaginative art has felt the spirit of surrealism, and Breton was possessed by it. He once screamed furiously, &quot;I AM SURREALISM!&quot;--and far from seeing it as arrogant or pompous, I think he was right.	2001-11-20

This will shake your banal perceptions and your begrudging acceptance of the monotony of everyday life by advocating a form of rebelliousness and hatred for the ordinary the like or equal of which I've never seen in any other medium. Although I am in definite disagreement with his misguided denunciation of surrealism, without which he never could have written this book, Bey has created one of the most unique and fascinating revolutionary manifestoes written for decades. &quot;Poetic Terrorism&quot; is the most exciting idea I've encountered in a long while, and after your first read you'll be eager to start 'terrorizing' the norm yourself, even if you're the most self controlled and mild mannered person imaginable. The beauty of this tiny molotov cocktail is it's insistence that personal rebellion, rather than superficial political activism, is the real way to freedom, a conviction I've held firmly for a good deal of my life. Only through a reordering and a total recreation of the individual's perceptions can he or she be truly free, and even then the mental discipline necessary for true liberation must be maintained with the greatest  vehemence.

(i, for one, felt like saying &quot;don't flatter yourself, dude&quot;). then read a collection of his essays, and he'll babble about how all of his friends loved him, and how he was just one of the guys.  any close reading of his work makes it apparent that he was simply an arrogant narcissist with a ridiculously inflated view of himself. it's fine to think highly of yourself, but past a point it becomes simply delusional, as it clearly did with miller. he thinks that during his lifetime he grasped every experiential truth life had to offer because screwed women of all kinds every which way he could, and yet his capacity to translate it into the abstract with style is nothing to write home about. every other paragraph you'll find poor old henry trying gallantly to communicate the meaning of life, and then three paragraphs later he'll say (as he did in &quot;the wisdom of the heart&quot;) that &quot;life needs to be given a meaning because of the obvious fact that it has no meaning.&quot; all great men are contradictory and this does not take away from their value or importance one bit, but the problem is that in miller's case he was not a great man at all, and so his endless contradictions and oxymorons only serve to take away from the small value that his books had in the first place. i share his hatred of authority and established values and share his love for the surrealist/modernist rebellion against literature, but i guess i'm classicist enough to expect even the most nihilistic and revolutionary author to have just a tiny bit of talent. read his work for the admittedly refreshing anti traditionalism and astute critique of conventional morality, but do not buy into the hype.to be given a meaning because of the obvious fact that it has no meaning.&quot; all great men are contradictory and this does not take away from their value or importance one bit, but the problem is that in miller's case he was not a great man at all, and so his endless contradictions and oxymorons only serve to take away from the small value that his books had in the first place. i share his hatred of authority and established values and share his love for the surrealist/modernist rebellion against literature, but i guess i'm classicist enough to expect even the most nihilistic and revolutionary author to have just a tiny bit of talent. read his work for the admittedly refreshing anti traditionalism and astute critique of conventional morality, but do not buy into the hype.	2001-11-06

(***)nonetheless, wilson is a truly passionate thinker (albeit one who engages in error and is clearly tainted with the snobby disdain virus that so many intellectuals are) with a natural propensity to explore and illuminate obscure philosophy and literature. just be wary of his claims to impartiality and objectivity.	2001-11-04

US	41093134	R4RL8ZKFNAY4V	0374249822	428211047	Revolution of the Mind: The Life of Andre Breton	Books	4	7	12	N	N	Essential for lovers of surrealism, but negatively biased	As far as pure information about Breton goes, this book is an absolute must have, and I immediately bought it myself.  But I personally feel that Mark Polizzotti is far too prejudiced in the negative direction as regards Andre Breton, and every admirer of his should keep this in mind.  He is an excellent translator and an undeniably well informed scholar with respect to Dada and Surrealism, but if he was so determined to bash Breton and take shots at him left and right, maybe he should have written another book called &quot;I'm Pissy and Cynical:Why I Hate Andre Breton&quot;.  Yes, it is true that Breton had contradictions in his character and attitudes, but all great men do. Breton's relentless campaign against all forms of coercion and institutional authority (indeed, authority of any kind) more than makes up for the flaws that he had, the flaws which we all have in one way or another. (A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, Mark.)  And let's keep in mind, not to be mean, who is writing the biography and who is getting the biography written about them.  Polizzotti makes sure to magnify Breton's admittedly dubious and perhaps even downright hypocritical stance on homosexuality to the point where you would think that Surrealism was about gay bashing.  Without Andre Breton Surrealism would never have even gotten off it's feet. His so called 'ex communications' were botched but at the same time basically well intentioned attempts to keep the surrealist rebellion genuine and authentic, and his supposed 'dictatorial personality' was simply his passionate nature translated into action.  Like all great leaders he wanted to adhere to the principles he had set for himself and the friends who accompanied him on the great spiritual adventure of poetry and 'the marvelous' that was Surrealism. Hate him or love him, what Breton himself said of Rimbaud's drinking buddy Germain Noveau can be said of the arch surrealist himself:&quot;Absolute non conformism ruled his life from beginning to end.&quot;is life from beginning to end.&quot;	2001-10-30
US	41093134	R3RET94H4DYFVT	0786703024	331431575	The Nightmare Factory	Books	5	15	21	N	N	Philosophical horror at its most chilling and disturbing	Ligotti blows Barker, King, and all of those other lightweights clear out of the water. His work is what I would call 'horror literature' as opposed to King's work, which he himself described aptly and which also applies to the work of most living horror writers of our time:&quot;the literary equivalent of a cheeseburger and fries&quot;. Using what might be called 'philosophical surrealism', Ligotti viciously rips the illusion of rationality and meaningfulness from our banal, everyday existence, and makes us painfully aware that the mystery behind our lives probably veils a truth that would upset us, or, as Nietzsche put it, &quot;disappoint us most unpleasantly&quot;. Readers who get off on literary nihilism and decadence (like myself) will delight in Ligotti's work. In the work of King or Koontz, good always triumphs over evil and all is ultimately well.  No such consolation in Ligotti. He himself has named H.P. Lovecraft as his primary influence and inspiration, and the similarities between these two dark horror gurus and genuine pessimists are not small.  For those of you with morbid or depressive tendencies, Ligotti's work might nudge you just a little further off that proverbial edge--his (probably accurate) assessment of the human condition as incomprehensible, dark, frightening, and ultimately meaningless is not pretty. You might say Ligotti is to horror what Schopenauer and Leopardi are to philosophy.  If you thought Kafka was scary, watch out.  This is not a guy who wants to confirm your optimistic delusions.	2001-10-29

It is a work of absolute passion and brilliance, and it is obviously Becker's 'magnum opus', the product of a lifetime's worth of study and reflection on the mystery and underlying meaning of human existence. First, Becker courageously faces what he knows to be true: that human culture and everyday activitity is a 'frantic sedative' of sorts and is not at all what it appears to be. Second, he admits that the human condition is in some ways terrifying and maddeningly paradoxical, in that human beings are quite vulnerable animals unfortunate enough to have the capacity to reflect on their horrid fate:death. He has no illusions about what so called 'neurosis' actually is--Becker knows that the people society call 'neurotic' or 'weird' are precisely those who have a deeper philosophical insight into the nearly paralyzing fundamental questions of human existence. His 'answers', (although as Sam Keen puts it, they are really only palliative solutions) are mostly pragmatic in nature and require what Kierkegaard (to whom a chapter is devoted)termed 'the leap of faith'. The only consolation Becker offers, really, is the acknowledgment that these agonizing ultimate questions are what all the great souls in the history of man (Tolstoy, Peguy, Nietzsche are just a few of those mentioned), have struggled with. The book's reputation as being depressing and heavy handed is not entirely unjustified, but this in no way detracts from its beauty or undeniable importance. Sometimes chilling, but nonetheless a supreme work of perfection, beauty, and authenticity.	2001-10-29

It blows &quot;All Quiet On the Western Front&quot; out of the water with ease, and that old hat needs to be replaced on high school book lists with this one.  After reading Trumbo's horrifying tale of a young man mutilated to the point of being better off dead, those 'strapping young bucks' might think twice about stepping onto the battlefield for any cause whatsoever, even democracy.  This book is a hopeless nightmare of sadness and unendurable suffering and I found it gripping to the point of basically reading it cover to cover.  If you're a very sensitive person (as am I), you should probably avoid it altogether or at least take it in small doses.  There really isn't a glimmer of hope in this book. In the end, although I have to admit that at times I wish I had never touched it, you have to respect Trumbo for having the courage and the talent to write something so courageous and deeply moving.  Trumbo forces us to realize that this young man's life is completely and irreparably destroyed, and that we are indeed to blame for it.  He makes sure we don't come away from this book psychologically unscathed: we ourselves were complacent enough to allow a senseless, horrific event like the first world war to take place, and the living hell this kid was unwittingly plunged into as a result of his naive trust in the values of country and so called 'honor' is of our own making.  He wants to rid of us our illusions about the invulnerability of the young to injury, and attack the ludicrous belief that war is somehow 'honorable' or glorious.  It is a senseless massacre that ruins and takes live remorselessly.  Maybe after reading this book (or seeing the movie, which in my opinion is equally as gut wrenching, perhaps even more so than the book because we have to watch the suffering rather than just read about it), will give you second thoughts about preaching to your kid the virtues of 'patriotism' or their so called 'duty' to get shipped to another country to be killed or even worse, to be reduced to the level of poor Joe Bonham, an innocent and trusting young man who never knew what him until it was too late.tism' or their so called 'duty' to get shipped to another country to be killed or even worse, to be reduced to the level of poor Joe Bonham, an innocent and trusting young man who never knew what him until it was too late.	2001-10-25
