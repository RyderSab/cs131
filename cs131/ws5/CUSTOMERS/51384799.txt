The isolated character of the Jewish people gave birth to an ecumenic belief afther refusing to share the universal ideas of the helenic civilization during the roman empire. This book is an academic work that, because of it's content, turns into a saga, the drama of mankind in it's depredation of mankind itself. <br />The history of the jews is plagued with irony, blood, fascinating stories of survival and enmancipation. This book narrates one of the most fascinating aspects of history, how the jews have managed to survive every depredation sent against them since much before our era. I think that the role of jews throughout the entire history of mankind might enlighten many other aspects for the avid history reader. I would consider this book a must read for anyone interested in history.	2005-07-07

Manfredi has made a wonderful work in bringing to life a journey through history in the rise and fall of the Greek civilization in Athens. The book is a journey through history, as well as a personal journey described by Manfredi, as he sends the chapters to a greek friend and then asks him what he thinks. <br />The narrative includes description of some of the greatest naval battles, like that of Temistocles against Jerjes of the Persian empire. It clearly depicts the problems, and advantages of warfare in the greek period. A must read for anyone who enjoys history.	2005-07-07

To read this book the reader must free himself of all prejudice, whether he's of the Christian confession or not. Even more if he is a Roman Catholic. Johnson has done a great job in writing this book in the most objective manner. I find that the church has much to regret for in it's history, as every institution run by men. That, however, is not the most important part of this book. <br />As Johnson begins taking us into the depths of the complex history of christianity, he talks of the importance of St. Paul, and how his letters (mainly that of Romans and Corinthians), gave final shape to a doctrine initiated by Jesus. Johnson does a great job in explaining the importance of the ecumenic and escathologic components of the christian belief. He also explains the ambience which gave rise to Jesus. <br />After attaining the most importan beliefs of the religion, and reviewing some fundamentals found in Romans and how they enter into the shape of the new religion, as well as narrating the first years of christian history, we arrive to Constantine. As teh roman empire embraces Christianity as it's religion, things must change, in order to make it an official religion. These changes requiere the unification of every scattered belief, such as the monofisits, or gnostic movements within christianity. This brings up the need to stablish de Canon. <br />This begins with a new phase in the history of this religion, which will then get to the roman empire, the middle ages, the cruzades, the reform, the counter reform, and so on, until it covers two thousand years. I find this book fascinating, but as always with history, the reader must be able to understand the pass of time, and viscisitudes concerning such institutions as the church. To claim the author tries to diminish the church, or use this book to claim that the religion is flawed, are both phallacies.	2005-07-07

But no book achieves to represent the dicothomy of christian values as The Idiot does. <br />The main character is every christian virtue as viewed by the bizantine church on Dostoievsky's time represented and exaggerated.

THis is even more so with Monte Cristo, the book is quite long, but filled with intrigue, if you think Dantes could be cruel on the film, just read the book. Also, it has a less corny ending, which I appreciate.<br /><br />Truth, the book is quite long, but it is completely absorbing, I just couldn't put it down, I finished it on 12 hours of straight non stop reading, just couldn't stop until the end. I most definetly recommend this book, and would consider it as a Must read for anyone who claims to be at least moderately knowledgeable.	2004-11-27

The author manages to make it unnerving to read. Not because of facts presented but because there's no sequence, no effort to write the book adequately. He goes un using exaggerted words, which come out of context with the book. <br />It is as if a highschool student wanted to make a display of his extense vocabulary, grabbed words out of a dictionary and made a great example of not knowing how to use them. The book is also too opinionated. It is leading you to the author's opinion, he leads on a battle without backing, to direct you to think that secret services are over funded, still filled with a seemingly patriotic belief in their good intentions. <br />On the whole, the author set on an ambitious idea of writing a book, tried to fit anectotic facts with hard history and set his opinions, and managed to make a hideous menage. There are better books on the subject, and I wouldn't recommend it.	2004-11-25

The subject is also undermined by it's own complexity. Slava Katamidze does a great job in presenting it in a simple manner, without losing the connections, and without losing sight of the man on the front. <br />The whole facts presented, I found it astonishing, and extremely revealing in the many things that allowed the extension of the cold war. It also serves to present the facts behind the communist regime of terror. In the whole, this book serves not only to understand secret services of the USSR, but the whole history of the Soviet Union. <br />The whole book is written in chronological order, which serves to keep the reader in track of everything happening at the time onthe global scene. The hardcover edition, with high quality paper, and the picture filled pages make it worth buying. I, however, disliked the unattention to several facts of history underlying the development of the cold war. The book centers itself on the history of the secret services, and somehow misses part of the international big picture.	2004-11-25

He is no philosopher, also truth. However, it is important to understand that this book is meant as history, not as philosophy. What the author intends is to portray the different perceptions of truth that have been developed throughout history. He does a great amount of research and the work is properly developed, however, he doesn't keep his distance in this one. He forgets that he intends only to portray, neither to support, not contradict different points of view.<br />This book lacks the cold view of the sckeptical historian that would create the propper environment for such a work. Better examples of truth understandig throughout history might be found after studying history itself. I would ratner recommend &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; by Sir James, and suggest &quot;Anacalypsis&quot; by Godfrey Higgins, if you can get your hands on any of them.<br />One thing to keep in mind though, truth never ceases to be theleology, a distant explanation, even if it comes through scientific theory. To understand this will help understand the variegated points of view about truth throughout history.	2004-01-12

The special relativty is easily understood, yet it is a topic covered in university as an speciality in majors more involved with physics, and general relativity is coverd in masters. Both topics can be quite esoteric, and the mathematical explanation for the relativistic deformation of the time-space due to speed uses Fourier's transforms, so most people will have to just have faith in what Einstein is trying to explain. However, he does simplify the subject enough, so anyone with a basis of physics could grasp some of the most important ideas behind his theory.<br />Furthermore, this book is important in the fact that by proving that relativity was a real fact in physics, the shape of the world in the twentieth century took a great change. I believe that without Einstein's work, the nihilism porfethized by Nietzsche, toghether with the despotic regimes that the will of power would create guided by deviations of the &quot;übermensch&quot; might not have com in such strenght as it did.	2003-11-29

Furthermore, he clearly unveils the myths behind the steel wall and clearly explains the Bandung generation which would give rise to many of the current conflicts in subsaharian Africa. To understand the twentieth century, he is as important as the books he makes reference to, excluding almost nothing, he even begins explaining the great influence of the relativity theory in modern times, yet some profound knowledge in several areas is necessary.	2003-11-29

The book has nothing of a prejudice, in fact the author begins explaining that his belief was that he would redeem the historical paper of Pius XII, yet he found that the church itself had been infected by some of the moral relativism that was profetized by Nietzsche, initiated by Einstein's theory, and gave rise to the despotic regimes of the twentieth century.	2003-11-29

It also treats a civilization of great importance in the history of America, and especially Mexico.

There is however one thing that could diminish it's greatness, and that is the tragic sense of Jennings.

However, what makes this book great is the fact that it clearly states the way coffee had an influence in the world and how coffee was influenced by different historical events. This book is not about coffee, but as the title states, it is about the influence of masses and advertizing over a product, as well as the influence of a product in the shaping of society.<BR>This book won't specify a lot about the plant or the drink in itself, but rather as it was brought to it's consumers and how separated is the origin from the end user of an agricultural product. It will help you understand more about economics than about coffee, yet it is not a bad book.

Nowadays it is hard to find an accurate and impartial history of civilization, and most of the civilizations we'll be able to read about do not illustrate the effort to transform the environment like some of the civilizations portrayed in this book. The book is arranged according to similarities in the environment which sprouted especific civilizations and which similarities these weathers produce in their civilizations.<br />In a different manner to what you'll most often find, he will explain the similarities of civilizations neither as the product of a proto civilization nor as a global consciousness, but rather as a direct consequence of the desire to transform the environment. The other thing that made this book refreshing (I know that most wont find a comparative history of civilizations refreshing) is how lucid Fernandez-Armesto's thougths on civilization are.<br />On most explanations you'll find that the process of civilization is a way to improve the way of life, which this book clearly proofs wrong, via evidence, not because he is against civilization, but because in a short term it would reduce the diet of humans, and would increase infectious diseases.<br />This is not only a work of history, but it clearly ilustrates the human mind and how it adapts, not only to it's own environment, but to external cultural influences. Though, as said on other reviews, Armesto fails to deliver all he promised (probably because he promises too much), still his work is worth of praise.	2003-04-08

The characters clearly evolve during the story, each facing their own situations, despite having a common origin. The series is long, but I intend to read all of it, for it promises a lot.<br />One most important thing is that, though the long walks are still involved in the book, you can easily go through the pages, entangled in a plot which is not over complicated, where, though the element of conspiracy and intrigue is still involved, it does not become a soap opera. A must have for any fantasy reader, or anyone who liked Tolkien's work.	2003-04-08

This particular companion, however, instead of optional rules or player characteristics, it gives a more complete background, absolutely necessary when running a chronicle for a game as Exalted. This sort of history and backgrounds is what will separate your chronicle from a common AD&amp;D RPG and a more complete, more human world.<BR>This book avoids the storyteller from inventing everything on the city and gives hundreds of guidelines for possible chronicles, besides, exalted is extremely hard to run precisely because of historical background, so, this book is quite useful.	2002-04-25

First, it's written in an essay form, not in his most known aphorisms. Second, it only speaks of classic thought, presocratics and dyonisian abandonment. This book is not Nitezsche's best, but it's always Nietzsche, if you are really interested in his work, this book is a most, if you are interested in the classics, this book is a most too. However, if you're only interested in philosophy, there are buch better books, specially when referring to Nietzsche.	2001-04-14

The Wolf and the human, throughout the book, Haller finds himself tormented by all things he has done, and all he knows.

Didn't Nietzsche say sckepticals were the only acceptable kind of humans? Well this book has a great sckeptical idology behind it, with a wisp of humor, of course, not adequate for Americans. Though the author is American, he's clearly what Nietzsche defined as a free spirit.<br />If you wish to understand philosophy and haven't quite withstood the ideas behind plato or find most books to institutional, you should read this book. Zarathustra was different before and after this book, this is how far it goes into explaining the ideas behind each philosopher, destroying it with the same Nietzschean hammer. (Read the epilogue also).	2001-03-28

This book is far to historical, can be somewhat overwhelming unless you are inlove with Nietzsche and Greeks. It is a clear demonstration that Niethzsche is a philologist and a great studier of pre-socratic thought. Personally, I would recommend other books of Nietzsche befor this one, even Freud's books are fresher.<br />Despite all it's errors, only Nietzsche can attain such a good view on greek thought. He is the onlyone that can rescue so much of the Greek culture, different from mithology, in one book.	2001-03-28

Humanizing Nietzsche is done greatly in concordance with &quot;Human, all too Human&quot;, the explanations to some of the ideology behind Zaratustra that appear on the book, as well as an example of Psychotherapy that clearly demonstrate Yalom's capabilities as a writer and psychologist. This book is, however, best intended for those who have experience the solitude of both characters in the book. It is also recommended to do some research on psychology and read some Nietzsche so you can better exploit the great contents of the book.	2001-03-27

Nietzsche's ideas behind the concept of free spirits talk about an intellectual elitism which is only to be understood by those who have lived it. A book trully for free spirits, but recommendable for everyone who wishes to reach such a status, or become knowledgeable on Nietzsches ideology.<br />Most of the ideas on this book prevail up to his latest works, unlike previous essays which are later diminished by Nietzsche himslef. If you like this book read &quot;The day Nietzsche Wept&quot;, if you liked that one, read this one. Let us face the truth: Nietzsche is a great thinker, specially for his time.	2001-03-27

Rather it will bring a new viewpoint on both buddhism and chrisitianity. Here Nietzsche makes the best use of his aphorisms to explain the ideas behind &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot;.If you are familiar with Niezsche, then, I don't have to say anything besides of saying it is one of Nietzsche's greatest.	2001-03-27

Nietzsche has expressed his desire to write &quot;A Will to Power&quot; even before &quot;Human, all to Human&quot; saw light. It is Nietzsche's most important and long work. However, be advised, this book is taken from his notes and arbitrairly arranged by Elisabeth Nietzsche, which could make us doubt it's fidelity on Friedrich's thought. There's also another warning, &quot;A will to power&quot; is for few of Nietzsche's readers and devoted one's, it is not just an opinion on things, it is a criticism and final development of his thought.<br />Only this book shows Nietzsche's final bite to the snake that bit his throat in Zarathustra. There's also a problem, Nietzsche assumes nihilism will invade the world in the 20th and 21st centuries, though nihilism hasn't really arrived everywhere. The arrival of new religions and mass media difusion of them have prevented the pragmetism first required for nihilists. Another problem is that people haven't really understood why Nietzsche claims god to be dead.<br />I think of this book as a great one, but i don't recommend it unless you are a devoted reader of Friederich's works.	2001-03-27

This book, as most of Nietzsche  talks about a wide variety of subjects and demonstrates his importance as Philosopher. Beyond good and evil is not only one of the most important and descriptive phrases by Nietzsche, but is also one of his best books. If, however, you're unfamiliar to Nietzsche's books, you should try &quot;Human, all too Human&quot; or rather look for &quot;The day Nietzsche wept&quot; this will help you decide whether Nietzsche is for you or not.	2001-03-27
