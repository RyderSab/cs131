Lori Foster is as reliable as the sunrise for a steamy romance and \\"Too Much Temptation\\" is certainly no exception.<br /><br />This book was wonderful from the first page to the last. Noah and Grace are such likable characters, you'd need a heart of stone not to root for them to fall in love. Grace, as the quiet, untouched beauty is the perfect contrast for modern, experienced Noah. She's loved him from afar (aaahhh) and Noah -of course- had no clue. Watching as Noah shows Grace (shy, virginal and way too low on self esteem) the woman she is inside, is fantastic. Grace thinks a few extra pounds should put him off, but it only makes Noah love every inch even more.<br /><br />The fact the Grace works for Noah's cranky, cantankerous and filthy rich Grandmother has kept her around Noah for years, but that does'nt stop our heroine from sacrificing that much needed job in order to stick up for him to the older woman when she gets her feathers ruffled. The results will have you chuckling with humor and sighing as Noah realizes that now that his eyes have been opened, he can never let Grace go.<br /><br />Lori Foster is a master at weaving characters throughout various titles, so look to follow \\"Too Much Temptation\\" up with \\"Never Too Much\\" where you'll meet Noah's brother Ben, and watch him also suffer the pains of falling in love. And you'll get to catch up with Noah and Grace. Two great titles...one great author.	2004-08-14

You can never lose with a Lori Foster novel. \\"Never Too Much\\" is a perfect example. While it picks up where Too Much Temptation left off, it stands on its own beautifully.<br /><br />\\"Never\\" is Ben and Sierra's story. Ben owns a motel and resteraunt, while Sierra owns the new landscaping business across the street, working 24/7 to get thing up and running. Ben is taken with the self contained workaholic, and wants to cozy up the her, but she resists (at first). But Ben soon sees Sierra is hiding from an unhappy past, and he realizes he'll do anything he can to help and protect her...if only she'll let him.<br /><br />Sierra is a great heroine - strong, independant and completely capable of controlling her life and her business without anyone's interfearence. Seeing these two strong willed characters come together is worth the fireworks! Ben is so determined to show Sierra she can lean on him, and Sierra wants to keep Ben out of the loop- and out of danger. Love, however, finds its way, thank goodness!<br /><br />Lori Foster -bless her heart- gives us a supporting cast to root for too. Like Ben's beautiful mother Brooke as she tries to fight her attraction to Sierra's only employee, the hunky Kent. These two are too hot for print, and would have even been great in a book of their own. You also get to catch up with Noah and Grace (Too Much Temptation) and of course Grandmother Agatha -who manages to hide a few surprises up her expensively tailored sleeve by the last chapter !<br /><br />\\"Never Too Much\\" is another fine example of a great story from a great storyteller. Romantic fiction it its best!	2004-08-14

'Public Displays of Affection' was actually my first Susan Donovan novel, but soon after reading the last page, I rushed to add 2 older titles to my Amazon cart!<br /><br />I thought this book was wonderful from beginning to end. The characters were easy to like and our hero, Joe Bellacera is almost impossible not to fall in love with. Charlotte, a widowed mom of 2 can't forget the fantasy man she spent one unforgettable afternoon with, and when he turns out to be - literally- the guy next door, the memories he sparks only prove how much she missed during her happy; yet tame sex life with her rather dull late hubby. The erotic poetry she secretly writes is her only link to the man shes forced to relegate to her fantasies until he drops into her life out of the blue, bigger badder and better looking than ever. The only damper is the $1 million price on his head, leveled by a drug lord DEA agent Joe is set to testify against - provided he lives!<br /><br />Joe and Charlotte have sizzling chemistry, and their romantic moments, both past and present, pepper the book at good intervals. The sex is certainly hot and steamy and Joe and Charlotte make a perfect romantic duo. Ms. Donovan has done a hell of a job. This is definately one that will be re-read!<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-08-13

'One and Only'is a fabulous fairy tale kind of love story between a beautiful, pampered yet independant princess and a hottie New York business tycoon. Barely out of her teens, Princess Isabelle is betrayed by the man she thought she loved and the older sister she once looked up to, when they announce their engagement. Things evolve into a tricky game of who's scamming who, but it still manages to take a backseat to the love story that grows between Isabelle and Daniel Bronson, a brash New Yorker who seems determined to treating her Royal Highness as just an ordinary girl. After a few heated, verbal sparring matches the two converge on a live New York talk show, as Isabelle strives to make a living after her sister exhiles her from the Palace. The heat between them is undeniable, and the pair decide to see where the sparks will carry them.<br />  Barbara Bretton ( The Day We Met, A Soft Place To Fall) does a fine job of giving her readers a front row seat to beautiful,and sexy romances, as well as sweet and unforgettable love stories. Her descriptions of the fictional principality of Perrault give you just enough detail to form a clear and stunning picture in your mind without lulling you into a coma. Her characters are well written and have some of the wittiest conversations you'll find in romance novels. The sparring matches between Isabelle and Daniel will make you chuckle even as your heart rate quickens as you wait for the next embrace.<br />  'One and Only' is a re-release (originally out in 1994), so if you did'nt get it then, pick this one up now. There's nothing better for curling up on a cool spring afternoon, than a romance by Barbara Bretton. Trust me, this love story will make you oooh and aaah till the last paragraph.

As is the case with all the finales to her trilogies, Nora Roberts kicks some serious butt with 'Face the Fire'. We finally get Mia's story, and what a story it is. As the most powerful and experienced of the descendants of the original Circle of Three, Mia taught Nell who and what she was (in Dance Upon The Air) and coaxed the reluctant Ripley back into action (in Heaven and Earth). Mia knows that in order to face and defeat the evil lurking at the tail end of the 300 year old curse placed upon Three Sisters Island, she needs the combined powers of both of her sisters, as well as the 'fourth element' - Sam Logan, a powerful witch himself. Mia and Sam's story of lost love is detailed her as well, as the reason for the rift between Mia and Ripley, and Ripley's reluctance to perform magic.<br />  With the very existence of Three Sisters Island hanging in the balance, Mia knows that she has to defend the people she loves and the island that means so much to her. No longer outsiders, Ripley's new husband Dr. MacAllister Booke and Nell's hubby Sheriff Zachary Todd vow to stand beside the women they love as well as Mia when the time comes for her to 'face the fire'.<br />  I was a bit surprised at Mia's final 'battle'on the cliff's, along with the rest of the cast. I thought it would have been longer and more detailed, but it was so full of emotion and excitement, you'd hardly notice. It was great to catch up with Nell, Zach, Ripley and Mac and see whats been going on in their lives. And to finally have Mia front and center was  fantastic.<br />Her conversation with Ripley early on in the book, explaining what had forced Ripley to distance herself from Mia and Magic for almost 11 years brought tears to my eyes.<br />  Bottom line....Nora Roberts is the best. She writes exciting romances and always adds that special touch of magic that makes her books the ones you'll reach for over, and over, and over.....	2002-06-24

When it comes to Sandra Brown, you never have to worry about her delivering a great story, packed with twists and turns. But  ENVY tops the charts !  The whole 'book-within-a-book' was masterful. As always, Sandra leaves her reader wondering if the truth really is stranger than fiction with the story of how two friends allowed envy to totally rip their lives apart, and the woman who must be clever enough to wrap together 15 years of loose ends. The insider info on the world of publishing was great to experience, and gives you an overview of what goes on behind the scenes before a book ever reaches your hands. It was informative without being boring. And as always, Sandra's bunch of colorful, strong, and savvy characters will leave you itching for more. Don't wait for the paperback.

It's truly been a while since I got up early to continue reading a book, but I did it for this one. This book was fantastic.It had everything.  May Taylor is a quiet, reserved woman, making the best out of a life that has left her dissappointed too many times. To top it all off, her daughter Kylie is 'gifted' with the ability to talk to, and see, angels. It is through Kylie's frequent trips to various doctors and specialists that May meet hockey legend Martin Cartier.One of Kylie's 'angels' tells her that Martin needs their help, and they need him. After a chance meeting and a freak accident, May and Martin find themselves so deeply in love it seems that nothing can tear them apart.<br />  As always happens in the books we love the most, reality is a nasty presense in the lives of our fictional heros, and May, Martin and Kylie must all face their own demons. Struggling to build their family and protect their future, the Cartier's must make their peace with the past.<br />  By the last three chapter of 'Summer Light' I was constantly dabbing at the tears. I was totally touched by Ms. Rice's  story, and found little Natalie to be as real as any other character in the book. This is a book I will HAVE to lend to friends, because I know how much they will enjoy it. And I know that I'll be keeping &quot;Summer Light&quot; handy enough to read again soon. Great characters, great story, great romance, great, great ending. Need I say more =:)	2001-09-03

Nora Roberts is one of the few 'constants' in romantic fiction today. As an author, she paints vivid characters and sets a colorful scene in your mind where her story will unfold. Her books never fail to capture your interest from the first paragraph and hold it till the last sentence. Her trilogies are beyond compare. 'Dance Upon the Air' is the first of a new trilogy that we fans have been panting for. As she did with her 'Donaovan Legacy' novels, the backdrop here is witchcraft. Trust me when I tell you, when you've finished reading this book, you'll wish you knew where to find a local, practicing 'good witch'.  Mia Devlin  finds the completion to the 'circle of three' in new islander Nell Channing. She knows Nell is running away, but sees in her the promise of the future. As in all Nora Roberts books, or hero Zack Todd is big, brainy and beautiful. The perfect knight in a shinig sheriff's badge. You get immersed in the love developing between Zack and Nell, and intrigued by Mia's spell casting and 'calling up the wind'. Ripley Todd, sure to be the star of one of the two remaining installments share some of the wittiest and most biting dialog with Mia. Their all too brief altercations will having laughing out loud.  I can, and have blindly recommended Nora Roberts books to all my friends without reservation, and 'Dance Upon The Air' is no exception. I can not wait until the fall release of the second book of the trilogy. Thanks again Nora! We can always depend on you !	2001-07-04
US	52840520	R2BD15A8QMJWYX	0451409825	479817725	Paradise Island	Books	4	4	6	N	Y	The Perfect Beach Book!	I'd never read a Gena Hale book before, but it was an AMAZON recommendation, and they're usually pretty much on the mark. This was no exception.  I enjoyed this book very much. I found it a bit thin in spots (like the sudden return of Jade's memory) but overall, I'd have to say that on the strength of this novel, I'd buy Ms. Hale's next book without question.<br />It was full of mystery, with plenty of twists and turns, and when the romance between Luke and Jade heats up, you'll be wildly flipping pages. I could completely understand Luke's suspicion of Jade as a plant by the media especially since a newspaper is offering a large cash reward to any woman who can 'prove' she's slept with the reclusive scientist. And when Jade literally floats into Luke's life, wearing nothing more than underwear and a blistering sunburn, and no memory of who she is or how she happened to be set adrift in a life raft with a head injury, the story really pulls you in. The secondary characters were interesting enough, but they only made me want to hurry and get back to Jade and Luke.<br />I'm really glad I bought this book. This is the kind of book I wish I could have saved for a day at the beach. But who knows, I may just toss it in my beachbag and re-read it on my next trip to the beach! Grab this one. You'll be glad you did.	2001-05-05

I knew it was a book I would read and enjoy... and boy, was I right !  Ms. Skye's charactres always seem SO vibrant and real, you almost feel like you could pick up the phone and call them. In 'Overboard', Carly and Mc Kay were no exception. Carly is the workaholic photographer haunted by the similarities to her deceased mother that she is only now discovering in herself. Mc Kay is the too-gorgeous-to-be-true hunk who bails her out of a jam professionally, and then risks his life to protect her when some slimey Russians take greed and revenge too far. Of course, being a Navy SEAL helps.<br />  As usual, the course of true love is anything but smooth, and the pair find themselves  caught in the middle of a dangerous swirl of murder and deception.  Basically, this book has everything. Looking for romance? Got it. Mystery? Check. Side-splitting dialogue and sharp witted sexual tension? Bingo.<br />  This book is everything we buy romantic suspense for. Don't wait. Click on the 'order' icon now.

As a 30-something avid reader, I still find myself digging into the closet and reaching for my old Judy Blume books from way, way, way back in my grade school days. Even then, as long as it had Judy Blume's name on it, my goal in life would  be to torture my mother until she bought it for me. Luckily for me, she always did.<br />I remember 'Sally J....' as being one of the bigger books I'd ever read, and one of the ones I carried around with me for days on end, sneaking a page or two during recess or in the cafeteria. I even remember having to hide my borrowed copy of 'Forever' because it had, what at that time, was a totally foreign subject matter.... s-e-x !  These days, I still don't hesitate to pick up a Judy Blume novel when it hits the shelves (or the pages of AMAZON.com).  But on those rare, quiet, rainey Saturdays when all the house cleaning is done, I'll still pull out &quot;Superfudge' or 'Deenie' or 'Tales of a Forth Grade Nothing' or 'Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great' , and have a high old time flashing back to my younger years. Judy Blume is greatly responsible for forming me into the voracious reader I am today, and I can't thank her enough.	2001-04-21

You made me laugh, you made me cry and you made me wish Jake were mine! I really enjoyed this book. (Can you tell?) I loved the 'heart' that managed to shine through each and every character, especially the eccentic and wonderful Annie. Here's a love story that grows from the most bizarre set of extenuating circumstances. Two people who were the unwitting victims of a somewhat crazed fertility doctor who decided to 'play God'. The result? A beautiful baby girl.  The characters were vivid and colorful, oh, and by the way, thanks also to Ms. Wells for a dynamite supporting cast !

Brilliant, funny, romantic and suspenseful enough to keep you turning pages like crazy. One thing you can always depend on, is Nora Roberts talent for immersing her readers in the 'world' she creates on paper. 'The Villa' is set in the California wine country, and by the time you're savoring the last page, you'll realize that you have not only just finished a great book, but you now have an informed perspective of the practice of growing grapes and producing wine. Nora always manages to teach you just a little bit about the topics of her books. And who can afford to turn down the opportunity to learn a little something new every day ??? As is typical of Nora, her lead characters of Sophia and Tyler spend the better part of the first half of the book sniping at one another, all the while wondering how long they can avoid their mutual attraction. Pilar and David also provide a beautiful and touching love story, and only add to the mental picture being created in your mind of the grand Giambelli family. The bottom line is this. Nora Roberts has another winner here. Are you gonna sit around reading endless reviews, or click the little 'order' icon, and have this book on your doorstep in just a few days? Don't wait.

I'll read absolutely anything she writes, and I devoted the better part of an entire afternoon to 'Voices Carry'. After enjoying 'Brown Eyed Girl' as much as I did, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one to see how Genna and John's story  would continue. There was lots of action here and a few twists I never even suspected. Thats the great thing about Ms. Stewart - she keeps you guessing !<br />  I thought 'Voices' had just the right blend of suspense and mystery and, of course, romance. Ms. Stewart writes characters you just can't help rooting for. It might be good to read 'Brown Eyed Girl' first just to get a feel for the characters, but 'Voices' will stand proud all on its own. And while you're shopping, if you happen to see any other books by Mariah Stewart - grab 'em! You won't be dissappointed !	2001-03-21

I fell in love with these characters in the first chapter! Shelby Barrett is the girl we'd all like to be- even for just a little while. Fabulously talented, smart, witty and  beautiful with a handsome snake of a boyfriend (who refuses to propose) and a mysterious 'make believe' admirer... who turns out no to be so 'make believe' after all. This book has everything you want ...romance, comedy, drama, and a cast of secondary charactres like Shelby's mom, romance writer Diana Valentine and Matt's Romeo uncle Lance- who steam up more than a few pages themselves. I really liked this book and will definately keep my eye out for other titles by Ms. Rabe. It's a lot of fun, and a really enjoying read. Grab this one today.	2001-01-24

No matter what kind of day I'm having, I can manage to sink into one of her stories like I do into my favorite chair. I look forward to ripping open my Amazon.com box and tearing into each new novel.Her characters are always fun and quirky , and seem to share a sometimes off-kilter sense of humor. 'All Shook Up' is no exception. I loved Dru. Here, we finally have a single mom who doesn't drone on for page after page about how life handed her the fuzzy end of the lollipop.Unwanted by her own parents, and forced,at 19, to raise a child on her own, Dru loves her son to pieces, and faces each day with a smile and a positive outlook. And J.D.? Oh,well. Ladies, how could you not love a guy who lives in faded jeans, crisp white T-shirts and has the shoulders of a football player??  Susan Andersen has done it again. This book is a bit lighter in tone than 'Present Danger', but still completely enjoyable. Her stories always make me smile. And isn't that the point of romantic fiction?	2001-01-17

I loved this book! It was sharp, witty and surprisingly touching. In 'First Kiss', the twist is that it's the man who wants to settle down and marry, and the woman who's looking for nothing more than a thrilling affair. Of course, we the readers , know that every good love story needs a little kick-in-the-pants from fate or perhaps something more along the lines of...divine intervention. By the first quarter of the book I was in love with Tom myself, and couldn't figure out what was taking Holly so long to go completely head over heels for this gorgeous hunk. Even the secondary characters here were enjoyable and pleasant, and Holly's confession of love actually brought a tear to my eye. I'll be on the lookout for other books by Ms. Pappano. 'First Kiss' is joining my collection of books I will definately read again.	2000-10-18

If I sat here all day, I couldn't begin tell you how much I enjoyed &quot;The Switch&quot;. Being a fan of Sandra Brown's, I bought the book the day it hit the shelves as I always do with each of her titles as they are released. I was kind of expecting the typical 'twins switching places and getting into trouble' story, but what I got was sooo much more !  Ms. Brown has worked her magic on an old story and given it a brand-spankin-new-twist! It's the kind of mystery that keeps possible endings hanging in the back of your mind, just waiting for the most bizarre shocker to pop out.  The ending of this book had me whooping for joy !  Outgoing Melina and reserved Gillian know each other better than they know themselves and when Gillian is brutally murdered after taking a life-altering risk (by being artificially inseminated), you can almost feel the anger and the loss her twin feels at the life thats been so cruelly wasted.  When her sister informs the police that, just the night before, the women had switched places so that Gillian (impersonating her media escort sister) could meet astronaut Christopher 'Cheif' Hart, things begin to get a little jumbled. But Sandra Brown only manages to weave the web tighter. After only two chapters, you'll be frantically turning pages trying to guess whats coming, and solve the mystery. This is definately a book to invest on in hardcover. Don't wait for the paperback version. Get it today, and enjoy it.	2000-10-01

We expect the best from her, and she never fails to deliver. In this, the second installment of her latest trilogy- 'Tears of the Moon' she brings us back to Ireland, and to  the Gallagher family.  This time we get to watch the fireworks that bring  middle child Shawn Gallagher to the realization that his one true love had  been his best friend since childhood, the fiery Brenna O'Toole.<br />  Brenna  is a classic Nora Roberts character- sharp, witty, clever with a phrase and  funny as hell. Her casual attitudes toward life and work give us all a  clearer picture of how much calmer we could all be if we'd only lighten up  a bit. Shawn, another of Nora's strong, silent heros with a heart as big as  the Irish countryside, will make you a beleiver in the power of love, the  bonds of friendship and the importance of family.<br />  As always, we get a  beautifully painted picture of Ireland, from the quiet charm of a family  cottage to the hustle and bustle of a busy Irish Pub. Nora has once again  givine us a great love story and a reason to keep our eyes glued to the  racks looking for the finale that will round out this trio (Heart of the  Sea- due in the fall).<br />  If your wondering whether or not this is the  right books for you, just be sure to grab 'Jewels of the Sun' (the first in  the series) and then move on to this one.

This was my first Elizabeth Bevarly book, so I wasn't quite sure of what to expect. And believe me, I was more than pleasantly surprised, I can tell you that! I really enjoyed this book. I thought the concept of Dorsey being  both the 'buttoned down' teacher vs. the 'sexpot' writer was going to be a  bit tiresome, but I truly enjoyed Dorsey and Carlotta's attempts to give  women a modern-day manual for trapping millionaires, and Dorsey's desire to  remain anonymous, so as not to jeopardise her academic career.<br />  As the  editor and CEO of a &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; for men,sexy, rich Adam Darien  feels its his duty to expose the mysterious, alluring 'eye-candy' sex  goddess Lauren Grable-Monroe and her runaway best seller 'How To Trap a  Tycoon' to his readership. Only trouble is, the writer of said best seller  actually turns out to be his bartender (at his Men Only Club), the brainy  and cerebral Dorsey MacGuiness or Mack - as he affectionately calls her.  Adam has already begun to fall for Mack, and she for him, when Dorsey is  forced by her publisher to make public appearances - under heavy disguise -  as Ms. Grable-Monroe. When the fictional writer turns out to be flesh and  blood, these two have a lot of fancy footwork to do to try and keep things  on an even keel, and still enjoy the fun of falling in love. Adam's friend,  fellow writer and employee Lucas ends up head over heels for Dorsey's  co-worker Edie. Their story is touching and charming, but I wish it had  been a bit lighter.In the end though, you can't help but rooting for Edie  to put her troubled past to rest and for Lucas to perservere and win Edie's  heart. The foursome are a whole lot of fun.<br />  I've already ordered 'Her  Man Friday' and will no doubt start on that as soon as the nice folks at  AMAZON  ship it out. I look forward to other titles by Ms. Bevarly, and can  highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good old fashioned  romance.Comedy, romance, wit, and a dose of reality make it a total 'beach  book'.

At first glance, I thought that since 'Guilty Pleasures' focused on the lives of two women, I might not be able to look forward to the strong love stories I've come to depend on Barbara Bretton's books for. Wrong. Corey  Prescott and Lili Spaulding are two independant females who are bound  together by 30 years of mistakes and regrets.  Lilly Ann finds herself  pregnant at 17 and is forced to give her baby away. Convinced that the  little girl will have a better life than what she could ever provide, she  gives up her daughter, knowing she'll regret it for the rest of her  life.Corey's life begins troubled. As an infant, the child is scarred in an  auto accident and Corey spends the first 6 years of her life shuffled  around rough foster homes and rougher foster parents who have no sympathy  for the childs disfigured face. Fate brings Corey to a family that long to  have a child to love, and it is not until she's a grown woman, that she  learns who her birth mother is. Corey vows to find the now famous cosmetics  tycoon Lili Spaulding and destroy her, but fate has other plans. Corey  finds that she must choose between vengence and the mother she never knew,  while Lili must destroy her 'son' to protect her daughter, and learn to  accept the love of the man who's held her heart for years.  Barbara  Bretton is so good at weeving these intricate lives, I sometimes forgot  that this book was fiction. She builds her characters so well, that you  keep wishing for just a few more chapters so you can keep the story going.  The bond between a mother and her child endures for over 30 year in  Guilty Pleasures, and it is one of the best 'love' stories, I've read in a  while. As with all her books Ms. Bretton keeps me hanging on to each  chapter, knowing that the next one will reveal more, dig deeper, and just  get better and better than the one before. It's a great book. Don't wait!  Click now, and grab this one. You won't be sorry!	2000-06-25

This is one of my favorite Sandra Brown books, and one that I re-read most often, because the love story of Ria and Taylor is so far off the beaten track, you can't help but root for them. One night of passion turns into a  committment neither of them could turn their backs on, even when all the  odds seem stacked against them. They put up a brave front for the sake of  Taylor's voting public, and Ria's family and professional colleagues, and  all the while they are falling so deeply in love with one another, you  can't imagine an outcome that does'nt have them strolling off into the  sunset. Be aware though, they do have their share of ups and downs,  tragedies and triumphs, but all in all, &quot;Tidings of Great Joy&quot; is  a must read for any fan of true romance.	2000-06-14

While I remain a devoted fan of Sandra Brown's, I was hoping for 'UNSPEAKABLE' to concentrate more on Anna and Jack, than I was about the twisted, and perverse highjinks of the Herbold brothers. Still, the story  was a deep and powerful one, and Ms. Brown painted for her readers, very  clear and concise pictures of her characters.  Her villianous siblings were  two  low-life's you just could'nt help wishing evil things on! And of  course she has us rooting all the while , that true love will conquer all.  While it may not be her best or most romantic book, it's well worth the  read ; as are all Sandra Brown novels.	2000-06-10

Typical of Sandra Brown, the only complaint I could find with &quot;Standoff&quot; was . . .  it was too short! Tiel Mc Coy is the type of character you want to really get to know, and once she and the handsome  and mysterious Doc band together to help two troubled teens out of a  suicide pact and a seemingly no-win situation with family interference, we  get the best of Sandra Brown's expertise - romance.  Standoff is a page  turner, right from the beginning. Each chapter ends with a hook that will  have you rushing to turn the page. Ms. Brown can always be depended upon to  give us a sharp,intricate story, and a beleif in the power of true love.  Standoff is no exception. Don't think about it. Get it.	2000-06-10

Aside from author Christie Ridgway, I have to offer my thanks to the editors at Amazon.com for this recommendation. I devoured this book in a day. On the bus, on my lunch hour, during dinner, after dinner...well, you  get the picture. I mean, what more could you wish for in a romance novel? A  super,sexy ex-astronaut, his big-wig NASA pal, and a pair of beautiful,  joined-at-the-hip sisters, who run the Islands Bed and Breakfast Inn, set  smack in the middle of a lush, fairy tale Island in the Pacific.  No deep,  twisting plots or dangerous villians here, just hours of pure escapist  pleasure. A true love story -through and through. I will most definately be  seeking our more books by Ms. Ridgway, and know that &quot;Wish You Were  Here&quot; will be joing the good old 'keeper' shelf of my personal  library. It is total enjoyment,just as perfect for your day at the beach,  as for a rainy afternoon trapped indoors. This is one book you'll never  regret buying.	2000-06-02

As with all of Barbara Bretton's books, this one is one that I know I'll take down every few months and re-read for the simple joy of getting lost in a sweet, romantic, touching love story that stays with you long after  you read the last chapter.<br />  Molly is a determined woman, forced to  find the strength and the courage to make a life for herself and her unborn  baby after her husband deserts her, and Rafe is the epitome of the big,  strong, silent Dream Man we'd all sell our souls to claim as our own. The  only thing they have in common is Molly's good-for-nothing husband, and an  empty, lonely house. With the promise of true love, and the anticipation of  'their' baby's birth Molly and Rafe turn a house into a home, and help each  other heal some very old and painful wounds.<br />Don't even hesitate.

After devouring both &quot;Simply Irresistable&quot;  and &quot;Truly  Madly Yours&quot;, I waited as patiently as possible for Rachel Gibson's  next release. It was well worth it! &quot;It Must Be Love&quot; is another  romantic treasure that will find itself among the books you'll consider  your &quot;keepers&quot;. I know for a fact that come the steamy summer  days, this will be the re-read I grab for a day at the beach! New Age  devotee Gabrielle Breedlove and  Officer Joe Shanahan are wonderfully  written characters with wit, humor and romance to spare. Ms. Gibson gives  us two radically different people (who upon their first meeting, pretty  much hate one another) and weaves an interesting story of intruige, mystery  and romance that drags us along with the happy couple on the bumpy road to  true love. Joe is the lucky cop elected to pose as Gabrielle's boyfriend  while the police try to nab her business partner for fencing stolen art.  Sparks fly left and right, and you'll find yourself wondering why the cops  in your neighborhood never seem as yummy as Joe!Note: Keep a watchful eye  and ear out for Joe's pet parrot Sam, who aside from being an avid watcher  of Jerry Springer shows and Clint Eastwood films, manages to repeat many  choice quotables from his favorite passtime - and interject them into the  story at the best possible moments!  Applause to Ms.Gibson for another  great story! I hope she's busy writing her next release. I CAN'T WAIT!!	2000-03-30

Way more!  I was looking for a flat-out old fashioned, sweet-n-sappy romance and I found it. Maggy and Conor are the  perfect ordinary people who find that love is definately better the second  time around. Better, and sweeter. They are none too trusting of the romance  blossoming between them, but they know it's something special,  and lucky  us,  we get to discover the joys of falling in love with them with each  page we turn. No deep mysteries, no gruesome murders, no crazed killers, or  flashy lifestyles. If your looking to sink into your favorite chair and get  that warm and fuzzy feeling only the best romances can offer, then this is  the book for you. Barbara Bretton has moved herself right on to my 'must  buy' list, and that's not an easy thing to do!	2000-02-15

Nora has hit the literary nail squarely on the head once again with the first installment of a new trilogy. Anyone who has read Nora's  &quot;Born in...&quot; or &quot;Dream&quot; trilogies can  appreciate the fact that these books are SO worth waiting for. Romance,  laughter, witt and humor mix together seamlessly in &quot;Jewels of the  Sun&quot;.

All you really need is Jayne Ann Krentz's name on a book to know it's more than worth the time and money. Her books never fail to give you a diverse and interesting group of characters, plenty of twists and turns, a great  love story, exciting settings, and a few surprises thrown into the mix for  good measure.  Elizabeth and Jack spent only one night together, but we  feel like we've been there from their first glance. Elizabeth is a tough as  nails, smart, succesful business woman who has no intention of letting the  handsome company head pull the wool over her eyes. Their dialog together  crackles (especially their resteraunt showdown) and the Film Noir Festival  setting is written with enough detail and description to be informative,  and yet not be overbearing.Jack and Elizabeth make a great couple, but it's  no less than we expect from Ms. Krentz.

Simple story about a runaway superstar singer locked away in gilded a cage by the manager who gave her her first break, and the man sent to find her, who eventually  loses his heart. Harley and Duncan are two characters who you can really  see living the 'happy ever after' kind of life found in all the best  novels. Michelle Martin did a fine job of keeping the story moving, the  romance hot, the charactres fiesty and the plot thick! Theres lots going on  in &quot;Stolen Moments&quot;, but most of all, it's a great example of how  important freedom and independence are, and how sometimes, the best things  in life are the ones that come along when you least expect it. You'll enjoy  this one. Don't wait, get it now !	1999-11-30

I'm not sure what book the'reader from Maine' was referring to, but it could'nt have been &quot;The Long Shot&quot;by Michelle Martin. 'The Long Shot'has everything you could possibly want in a romance novel - a  hot,steamy romance, a good mystery to keep you guessing, an interesting  background story, years of unrequeited love,plenty of interesting 'second  string' characters,lots of sharp, snappy, witty dialog to keep you turning  pages, and even a few surprises.  I just wish this story could have been  longer, but had to settle for pulling out my copies of 'Stolen Moments'and  'Stolen Hearts' - not exactly a hardship since they're two more Martin  faves. If you want a good book to get completely lost in for a while, pick  this one up today. After all, is'nt that the reason we fans read romance  novels in the first place? Enjoy!	1999-11-30

After falling head over heels for &quot;Truly Madly Yours&quot; I hoped &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot; wouldn't let me down. IT DID NOT !! What a great book! Georgeanne Howard has to be one of the freshest characters I've  read about in ages. A woman with what many would consider a less than  perfect figure, a limited education ( and a learning disability), and the  guts and grace to overcome even the highest hurdles life puts in her path!  Even big, rough-tough pro hockey player John &quot;The Wall&quot; Kowalsky  can't resist her sweet Southern charm! Rescuing her from marrying his aging  boss was not what John expected and certainly not what Georgeanne bargained  for, and after one night together their futures are changed forever.  It's  a sweet, romantic love story, with characters you can't help but root for.  Get this one today! You'll love it, too!!!!!	1999-10-05

But I simply could not wait for the paperback of this book. Thanks to AMAZOM.COM I did'nt have to. I had the hardback delivered to my door, and am I glad I did. Another great Donovan tale from the incomprable Ms. Lowell. For those of us who loved the steam and  suspense of &quot;Amber Beach&quot; and then &quot;Jade Island&quot;,  &quot;Pearl Cove&quot; was sooooo worth the wait. Big, bad, Archer is back  with a vengence... and a sizzling story. Hannah is the perfect match to the  eldest Donovan, and we are given hints to what happened after other  favorite couples (Jake and Honor, and Kyle and Lianne) 'walked off into the  sunset'. I am comforted to know that the remaining Donovans will be  cropping up in the future, and look forward to reading about Lawe, Justin  and Faith. READ THEM IN ORDER, AND READ THEM NOW !

I pull it off the shelf every few months to re-read it, and it's still as fresh and interesting as the day I bought it. Meredith and Matt are irrresistable as the lovers whom  you know in your heart will make you truly believe that love makes anything  possible! Circumstances hinder their relationship at every turn, but still  they manage to beat the odds, and find a way to be together. And best of  all.... after you read the last page of &quot;PARADISE&quot; you get to  pick up with Meredith and Matt in &quot;PERFECT&quot;,  and find out what  happens after they walked off into the sunset. While not a sequel,  &quot;Perfect&quot; is another great love story. Julie Matthison and  Zachary Benedict will remind you just how great a writer Judith Mc Naught  is. Two exciting stories that prove the true power of love. Sometimes,I try  to decide if I have a favorite among the two, but there's no need. After  all two are better than one anyway!Pick up &quot;PARADISE&quot; and  &quot;PERFECT&quot;. You Just can't ask for a better way to spend your  'reading' time!	1999-05-08

How can you possibly get enough of the Mac Gregor clan?

Cybill and Preston make a great romantic couple, although I found  myself pleading with him to 'chill out' a lot sooner than he did! Still Ms.  Roberts has always given us grade-A romances and this is no exception. My  only complaint is that ; as with all of her books, I wish they were longer.

Although she was'nt exactly the 'warm and fuzzy' type of character, I found myself really rooting for Lydia.The promise of more on her relationship  with Nicholas kept me going thru Molly's and Cassie's stories, neither of  which held the same heat - although, a lack of heat was definately not a  problem!

Zach Taylor seems to be the immovable force that  Julia needs to give her life the direction she searched for.

It's the kind of book that you never tire of reading and re-reading. The characters are like old friends. It's a love story that survives out of the most stressful and  dangerous of situations, but Julie and Zack still manage to capture our  hearts.From childhoods that could'nt be more different - except for their  shared unhappiness, Julie Matthews and Zachary Benedict have worked to  create the 'perfect' lives for themselves, and we get lucky enought to tag  along for the ride. And as an added bonus we get to catch up with Meredith  and Matt from &quot;Paradise&quot;. It's a testament to Ms. Mc Naught's  ability to resume the lives of these two great characters and not manage to  beat the story to death. They are still as fresh and interesting as they  were in the first novel. Future readers beware! Be sure to read  &quot;Paradise&quot; and then continue on with &quot;Perfect&quot;. I  promise you will not be sorry you did.They are both great summer-time  &quot;beach books&quot; but don't wait to spread your towel on the sand .  Grab them now and enjoy them.

As a fan of Meryl Sawyer's for quite some time, I am used to snatching her books off the shelf the minute they're unpacked, and &quot;HALF MOON BAY&quot; was no exception. I had been waiting for this book since I  learned of it's existence last summer, and it was definately worth the  wait. As usual Ms. Sawyer has turned out a fine mystery, a sizzling love  story, and a group of characters  that stay with you long after the last  chapter. Amy Conroy has  been forced to live with a hideous facial  birthmark all her life, until a freak accident gives her a new identity,  and a man to love her - if she can manage to elude another man who wants  her dead. Matt Jensen, who made an all too brief appearance in  &quot;TEMPTING FATE&quot; is back as the man who mistakes the badly injured  Amy for &quot;Shelley&quot; -a woman who turned into a stalker after their  one and only date. Twists and turns are Meryl Sawyer's specialty, and she's  done her best to keep her readers busilly turning pages. Teasing references  to great characters from novels like &quot;THE HIDEAWAY&quot; and  &quot;UNFORGETTABLE&quot; help to make &quot;Half Moon Bay&quot; like a  visit with old friends. Thanks Meryl, for making Half Moon Bay worth the  wait - and for keeping us waiting for more ! DON'T WAIT. GET THIS ONE NOW  !!!	1999-02-16

Being a native  Philadelphian (where the story is set I appreciated the many references to  places I grew up around. But believe me, my life was never half as exciting  as Kate's !!

I loved this book! I purposely kept it to read on  vacation, and am glad I did. I read it in a day, and then found a bookstore  by the beach and dug up another half dozen Linda Howard's novels.  Sweeney is a great character, a lady whose preoccupation with her art  does'nt always allow her to understand whats happening to her, but does her  best to cope with the hand she's been dealt. Richard Worth is the  quintessential leading man - strong, handsome, loyal, sexy and romantic.  Once he realizes that Sweeney is the woman he's been looking for to give  his life some meaning, he does'nt let anything get in his way. And there  are plenty of obstacles - like a lover who see ghosts, and paints as yet  uncommitted murders - in her sleep,not to mention the brutal murder of his  soon to be ex-wife .  I'm sure fans of Linda Howard's are not surprised  with such a great novel, and I look forward to searching thru Amazon.com 's  stock for her other available titles. A great love story, a great mystery,  and a whole bunch of memorable characters. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE !!!	1998-09-22

If you like a mystery that keeps you guessing, a love story  that sizzles, a leading lady who is as smart as she is sexy, and a hero who  defines the meaning of the word - then this is the novel for you. Claire  and Cassidy leads a cast of well-crafted characters, that will keep you  eager to turn the page and find out what comes next. Unfortunately for us  readers,(as with all Sandra Brown's books) the endings come way to quickly,  and you have to shift your imagination into overdrive to keep the story  going in your mind past the final chapter. &quot;FRENCH SILK&quot; is a  fantastic read. Set against the colorful and captivating backdrop of New  Orleans, Ms. Brown weaves a tale of mystery, suspense and an unforgettable  story of romance and family loyalty.
