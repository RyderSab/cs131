US	30632463	R4LBIPR6SLU9F	014143984X	821153252	Dracula (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Dracula	I have watched several versions of Dracula but reading this book is the first time for me. Well, it has no close similarities with any movies I've seen except, of course, Bram Stoker's Count Dracula which has Hollywood spices in it. Compared to the movie, I felt the book's sense of the sensualities and Dracula's motivation in choosing his targets were less fluid and sometimes too coincidental. But I enjoyed the original hunting process more than the movie one, with treasured views from each man involved, not just Van Helsing's. My edition has the afterword which really helped to understand how the writing came to be like that but aside from all values it tried to represent, this is a referenced literature work everybody must not missed.	2005-10-13

The twist of a far away time in the future, when Ancient civilization (us) has destroyed themselves by warfares and ultimate mortal engines, really made the story hard to put down. The stage was created complete with the new religions, new ways of life and new societies. All was well but I can not help if I feel something missing by the end. Perhaps it was the easiness of the author in killing many of the key characters, but I think it was necessary to picture the power of destruction of the resurrected engines or it just the quiet ending after the great climax. In short, I like the unexpected elements and am looking forward for the next book.	2005-10-13
US	30632463	R1353XK88LQG3U	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	3	13	16	N	N	A Vague Historian	I picked this one because someone told me it was great and surely, the cover image was very tempting (is still now). The prologue and the premise looked inviting. I admit I was hooked from the start and I felt I would have a great time with long mysterious adventure. The language was literary well composed and the lines were easy to grasp and you could sense the rhythm when you read it aloud. And of course the thrill of the vampire chase was addictive, with histories thrown here and there like parts of a giant puzzle. What vampire maniac could resist? <br /> <br />But on my way, some things started to bug me. I warn you to finish the book first or at least have the resolution not to be affected in any way, before you read any of these. <br /> <br />First was the vague history of Vlad the Impaler. It was said that he lived from 1428/31 - 1476 with several ruling periods, at least three from what I gathered but I didn't find when was his first and for the one after that, it got muddled up with the time of his imprisonment in Hungary, which confused me in the midst of my reading. I have never read the real timeline document of The Impaler but at least I know logically if a king is in prison, automatically the throne falls into either his successor or opponent.  <br /> <br />Second Ms. Kostova seeming effort to make this as a story told form first person view was very disturbing. Too long letters were supposed to be written, in spite of the assertion that it was done in 6 (long) months. Well, just imagine yourself writing every detail of conversation, research, event of 20 years ago and put it down in a pile of papers.... that sounds implausible. Do you remember any important event with its details from start to finish 20 years ago? I don't think so, unless you used a camcorder and taped every one of them :P.  <br /> <br />Third, the insistence of making the narrator nameless (until almost the last chapter if I'm not mistaken), has impacted: a key source, who was the narrator's grandmother, was nameless too, so she was known only for her family name (poor grandma); her mother called her 'my dear daughter' even when she was face to face with her, like some dubbed Mexican telenovela; her father seemed a very remote figure, self-centered person; her boyfriend became a weird guy, didn't seem able to say her name even once. And you know what, it didn't pay of a bit. No mystery in itself, it only left the taste of the improperly stubbornness of the author. <br /> <br />Fourth, the end is too abrupt, too easy. Was Dracula that clumsy? How the hell he could live 500 years if he didn't have any cunning and cruelty larger than life? Pathetic. So much for the (waaay tooooo) long notes. <br /> <br />Fifth (don't frown too much, it's the last), her attempt in leaving the reader with a question after finishing this book fell flat. What did it signify anyway? That the narrator must search all over again for Vlad's history, which she has learned by heart long time ago? That one of his servants had managed to take over his command (although without the books any longer if the clue had the right meaning)? It was like ' Oh, I need a full circle ending, what could it be ....' and voila .... I think it would be better to leave it just with the question: what would happen with others who had been contaminated? Undoubtedly they were not as shrewd and cruel as Dracula himself so no way anyone could change that position until perhaps another 500 years.	2005-09-15

I don't know why the critics say the question this book presented is: Whether the apparitions were ghost or the governess' imagination? It surely doesn't seem to me as a product of an unsound mind. The governess didn't have any history connected with the so called apparitions and the last scene did show that the boy knew and could connect with 'the others' all along, not just a passive party who didn't know anything, like the housekeeper. Note that the way that he was the one who first pronounce the apparition's name, unlike when with the little girl, who was posed with the entity's name by the governess first. <br /> <br />While in the movie \\"The Others\\", which is said to be based on this book, the conclusion is made clear and the horror is deepened although there is a difference concerning guesses about the viewer's mad situation. In movie, the apparition had never show their face unless they were the same 'species' with the mother and the kids were not so much cunning sweet angels themselves which is a plus for the book. <br /> <br />As a warning, the words could confused a modern reader because there are so many long sentences with more than 2 clauses included. Luckily it is a short story. <br />	2005-09-09

I opened the first chapter and wow! a science fiction time travel that asked for my attention every minute until it finished. <br />It was opened directly to the sensation after drinking the experiment drug which can bring you back into the long forgotten past. The past I am talking here was not in the time span of the narrator, but outreached 600 years, digging from the DNA memory of his ancestors which built his now. The theory of survival. This is not some Einsten Relativity story, where mind and body could be transferred along the time dimension, but it was only a loop of mind travel in which could do nothing to alter the past. <br /> <br />The writing style is the trademark of Du Maurier, with clues, subtleties and irony turn of events whose importance sometimes escape from the first time reading although the sentences themselves are effective but still have the literary beauty. She dared to explore the possibilities and left no stone unturned. The selection of past time itself can raise a debate to whether it was a pure past or already meddled with personal infliction. However, the introduction chapter (warning: read this AFTER you finished the book) by other famous author gave some light to the background circumstances. <br /> <br />The ending is quite open to give the reader freedom of thought, to imagine the meaning of it, whether it was all over, in the real meaning, of both worlds or just for one, or better yet, if an 'alter' ego gone, will the other follow ... or was it 'alter' ego anyway?	2005-08-26
US	30632463	R2KPO2P6STNZNZ	0060392487	986540287	Transgressions	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Woman Disturbed	I thought I was going to read a smart thriller and Boy, I was surprised. I admit I agreed with most of her thoughts and perceptions but with her being seductive to a rape-intentioned stranger? That was like the inner mad impulse of a female attraction to the wild, unpredictble thing... even too crude.  <br /> <br />At one point, I thought Eliza was crazy in inviting him in the first place. Why didn't she just make a move to cunningly seize the weapon and attack him while he was in a trance? Like the woman she created on top of the original translation work would do? Yes, it's true, a woman always fights back but I don't think the fight-back principal was presented well in this story. Her want of the stranger was too obvious to be taken as a revenge or a fight back. Perhaps that the whole point, Eliza didn't know herself well. It is the Dr. Jeckyl and Ms. Hyde problem. The dark side you never want to recognize.  <br /> <br />Although this is not my cup of tea, I felt intrigued by the ending. There was a spark of ingenious when you can review the whole story. <br />Mind you of the many (I mean MANY) the F*** word.	2005-08-16

I feel like I have been growing along with the characters.  <br />Just like John Lennon's infamous 'Imagine', this book showed that no matter how different your religions, idealisms, nationalities, genders, and races may be, you are still all the same human beings, with the same sense of moral, of humanity, of appreciation of differences which makes life not dull. When humanity lost, there is only automaton, war and destruction beyond hell's fire. <br /> <br />Filled with some unusual words that you must have at least a complete English dictionary next to you to understand it fully and appreciate the selection of the word. I felt I was listening to a historical story told by someone's grandfather because it seemed so personal with witty conversation and humorous lines but filled with shrewd observations and reflections. It doesn't mean that all of it was told by the same person. Each character, even Musolini had his part in story telling.  <br /> <br />The romance was portrayed in the relationship between Pelagia and Antonio Corelli, brought together by means of his beloved mandolin. This was not the 'roll-in-the-dust' romance, but an old fashioned one. The scenes and dialogs when Corelli courted her till Pelagia's acceptance and their short togetherness keep playing in my mind. You don't easily find this kind of romance nowadays.  <br /> <br />But I have an objection though about some last chapters which to me is too self-indulgent if I may use a term from the book.  <br />All in all, it is a very great read :))	2005-08-16

This whole thing made it hard to guess what will the seventh book bring. <br /> <br />Many questions about Voldemort's parents answered and the suspected would reveal himself, cold hearted.

Based on her great-great-grandmother, Ms. Du Maurier weaved a story of a woman's power struggle and web of intrique played in society dominated by men. Set in London at the time when Paris was being ruled in Terror regime, London was in  parliamentary turmoil and both countries are in war at the end of 18th century.  <br /> <br />Mary Anne, with her cunning wit and unbeatable Irish blood, was born in London slum neighbourhood. With her resourceful mind, she determined to be a success in men's world by playing the same game, with the same rules. She first tried to find a wealthy husband but got a big-mouthed, good-for-nothing one instead. Not to be beaten by circumstances, she left her husband and started to use her unique beauty to make connection, to be a 'social climber', in order to provide food and shelter for her 3 children, a mother, a half-sister and a brother. As time would have it, she was introduced to The Duke of York, became his mistress and the scandalous dealings began. <br /> <br />Being a mistress to a prince didn't mean she would have unlimited income. On the contrary, to maintain the house, lifestyle and servants, she must do 'side job' by promoting soldiers to the Duke with some amount of fee.  This would lead to the most scandalous trial(s) in England concerning royal family. <br /> <br />The dialogs and the statements were beautifully written (but no ramblings) while the characters each had their own strength and weakness. It was said that there are some resemblances between the author's life with the main character which added to the substance of the story. All I can say is I admire her wit and I see the reasons behind her every move. <br /> <br />Feel the spirit, see the dreams and understand the love of life which came from a woman named Mary Anne.	2005-07-20

But no, it went much much deeper. It evokes the essence of the nature, what nature is, who are humans and why are we here. This is the book to remind us amids the glory of tool, weapon and gadget inventions, to open our eyes to the world around us which does not only consist of human, but also full with animals, plants and the earth itself. <br /> <br />There is also some thoughts of religion, what should we believe in religion when we found out that the stories were not true (like what has been happening lately). Even I can identify some of the make-up religions the wolves had. It is so inspiring read for those who felt cheated by life and religion.	2005-07-01

I was intrigued by the-Prince-Pauper thingy but with more weight on the issue that caused the charade. Although I can't say I like the ending but I feel it is the true way to end this story. Not a simple type of ending where everybody get all they wanted, the good characters win over the bad. It belongs to the whole story, adding the irony. Each character was in grey zone, no one was all white or black. <br /> <br />The issue of family and people relationship played the circumstances over the exchange of John and Jean, the 2 look-alike person but with very different background. John, the loner, had no family ties, as the narrator. While Jean, a father, lives with a sick mother, a silent sister and a troubled family of his brother to deal with. While John felt himself as a spectator of life, Jean complained about his demanding family. Was it only the family's fault or Jean's himself who caused the oppressive situation? <br /> <br />All things were started from inside oneself. It is like throwing a stone into a pool effect. What you think, which will come out as words / action will affect all the people around you. What you think a good decision does not always give the same impression to other people because each person has her/his own perception, unique way of viewing a problem. <br /> <br />You would just feel as conceited as the characters you were reading. A thoughtful story.	2005-06-15

Fast paced. No extra burden for the eyes. <br /> <br />THE BIRDS, the inspiration of Hitchcock's movie version. Although it is different between the book and movie, the dread they caused <br />is almost the same with their own focus. In the movie, you'll get the visualization of the dread while through book the description of the attack was violent enough that you couldn't see no end. <br /> <br />MONTE VERITA. It's like reading supernatural story about Maya people at first which was followed by friendship between 2 people, their meeting with a very beautiful enigmatic woman until the strange happening in Monte Verita. In the end, it was still the supernatural one but behind it, there was a horror value in it that makes you see what Monte Verita really was. <br /> <br />APPLE TREE. This is my fav story of this book. A creepy tale of a wife that haunted her husband after her death. <br />What you thought will not be the same with what you would along the way. A very good material for Outer Limit program. <br /> <br />LITTLE PHOTOGRAPHER. Like watching an Agatha Christie's mytery movie but leave the detective part. This is a story of unintentional villain with heart that was numbed because of life. <br /> <br />KISS ME AGAN STRANGER. Hohoho, this one has a horror surprise!! I wouldn't give any detail what kind of surprise less it would spoil the fun. <br /> <br />OLD MAN.

Now, I had the second chance to appreciate it by reading the book. Oh, I found the source story is more beautiful than ever. As most movies from book, though the plots are almost the same, but there are details and small plots that weren't included. My understandings, feelings, thoughts and visions are deepened from the reading experience. I must watch the movie all over again.  <br /> <br />Mr. Beagle is a great storyteller. He didn't just make a fantasy with typical plot, but he used details from other fairytales and composed them as the frame to represent his thoughts. So, my opinion about this story has not changed since I watched it in 1980's: this is a beautiful original one. Just consider these points: Do your part in this life though you don't seem to like it now; define your own time; there's no ending to the story of life, only the continuation from one story to the next; and last but not the least: unicorns live forever @-->--	2005-05-02

The language beautifully flowed and the feeling it invoked is very deep, even after you have finished it. Although some would say there were loose ends in this one, I'd say all answers is in the lines, all is there for you to read and feel.  <br /> <br />The story itself is a combination of Tam Lin and Winter Queen, with a bit of folklore spices. It didn't give a direct answer for every question but it certainly gave clues for you to figure out the whole picture. Also it rarely gave names to the answers, just a representation, a hint. This is what I like about her books, it always gives me space to build my imagination, to make my own dream along with the story. Excellent!!	2005-04-25

Like all the rest, I assume it was just a relic hunt. But No, Dan Brown saw to that and now I am hunting for the facts. <br /> <br />Named in Da Vinci Code, this book is one of the source Langdon and Teabing used in their explanation. So naturally I looked for and was very fortunate to find it. With more that 30 pictures attached as the references of what she tried to say in her book, this was very satisfying in its own way.  <br /> <br />The book is started by a fiction story of Mary Magdalene which was not clear who wrote it, then it proceeds to each subject concerning Magdalene based on the Bible, along with the facts and fiction gathered from books by other researches , added with some hypotheses from Ms. Starbird. There is so much info I get from reading this, including more understanding of what Tarot cards really hold in their pictures.  <br /> <br />But I think there are still too many repetitions of subjects between the chapters which sometimes made me lost focus of what was being discussed. It is very helpful to have the Index page but it would be better if Ms. Starbird could reorganized some of the subchapters an make it more systematic.	2005-04-21

Although some people say that not all of the info is true but just the whole idea is provoking and plausible. I'm going to check them out on ther books. Well, you can not read the Bible (specially New Testament) with the same light now.<br /><br />Dan Brown has managed to bring the data and not just made it in boring essay but into a thriller and mystery.<br /><br />But this book is not perfect. Actually I want to give this book less than 5 because the main characters need to be worked up a bit because of their inconsistency response to problem at hand. Specially agent Sophie Neveu that I felt too slow at the beginning for a French CIA's agent but nearing the end, suddenly to self confident. If that was used to array the clue from Langdon, I think Mr.Brown could use another method than slowing her down.	2005-04-19

(Teen's Top 10 (Awards))	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Pirate Queens	This book is about 2 girls, with different background and culture, embarked on a coming-of-age story as pirates. I always am interested in pirate stories, especially after watching The Pirates of Caribbean which is exactly where these girls did their first pirating period, Caribbean Sea. <br /> <br />Needless to say, the premise already hooked me, with all the story of Nancy's childhood. As she grew up, she would find out how far a woman's worth, as the same as cattle, ready to be married and be breeder to strengthened family position. In this story, the villain is described in a very dark nuance, backed up with dark mysteries (what's a pirate story without mysteries?). <br /> <br />Basically, the plot is simple, no big twist occurred actually, other than pirate fightings which were scarcely described, which made me kinda thirsty for duel scene. The inviting premise wasn't fully followed by heart thumping adventure and the climax seemed a bit flat and again, no battle scene. <br /> <br />As for the main character, Nancy and Minerva, although Nancy was the narrator, but I felt more in awe to Minerva. I didn't think Nancy could do anything piratical, although she claimed to have learned the skill of sword duel from her officer-brother. Her only described duel only ended in her captured so fast that it didn't feel like one. Not like the duel between Minerva and the mutineer, it was so much exciting. It seemed when she became a pirate, she was a different person from the one who can lead other children and had her own principle. <br /> <br />Well, that's why I only give this book 3.5 for good story but lack of action and twist for a pirate theme.	2005-03-31

Well, I confess, this is an amazing story and I think rather original, not like any other 'smooth happy-ending' fairy tale. <br /> <br />First, Ani (Princess Anidori) was reared not as the only child. She has 4 other siblings. Second, she has gifts, which was expected, but not used them so eccessively (not for doing 1 on 100 battle), just simple use like conecting with her surrounding. Yes, she used that gift in a fight once but she also was helped by her goslings and it made sense.  <br /> <br />And the prince (which is the third), though introduced with a way that is usual, but very different in action compare to ex. Prince Phillip from Sleeping Beauty. Oh, he was heroic and all, but he didn't feel ashamed to be helped in his combat and 'real' with human weakness and vanity too. <br /> <br />Fourth, the happenings was not like being made up with nice coincidents and you just have to turn the next page to know. <br /> <br />And all of that tale is told in simple but beautiful words, just like a story-telling should be. I can only say, reading this, has made me repeating the song 'Tammy'... just read it an you'd know why.	2005-03-17

I have watched GWTW many times (but not read it yet) and I have read 'Scarlett' looong time ago but in a jump around mode (because I was not a good reader back then) and I thought well, it was a very romantic sequence. Then I watched the 'Scarlett' miniseries and thought I liked the book version better. Now, finally I got the chance to read the book as a whole and ... I can not say it is totally good anymore. <br /> <br />I enjoyed first chapters very much although some may say that Ms. Ripley taken Mammy out too quickly from the picture but I found no trouble with that. In fact, I became to know who Scarlett was, a determined, fight-till-the-last-drop heroine. I think Ms. Ripley has done a nice job for making the event in Tara and make Scarlett showed herself instead of just moping and get on with life in Atlanta. <br /> <br />When the event was turning from America to Ireland, I also didn't find it disturbing. I was actually glad she found something new and I love Irish themed things. As when Scarlett realized how bad she had treated Rhett and all of the people around her and for not thinking consequences of her acts, I really loved her then. She became a woman finally, not just I-want-it-the-way-I-want girl. The mature side was emphasized by the unconditional love she felt for Cat.  <br /> <br />As for the Georgia's Tara, Scarlett did love the land and fought for it, but in the end, after she had Ballyhara and know the 'real' Tara, she inherit the land to Wade, her son from Hamilton (not Sue Ellen as a review mentioned. Scarlett knew better than that). It was a logical thing. When you have a nature like Scarlett who sometimes could be generous towards those that matters to her when needed plus her new found wisdom, yes, that could happen. <br /> <br />But somehow, from somewhere after she gave birth till the finish, I found the plot went out of the track: <br />1. If Scarlett loved her child more than anything in the world, how could she leave her in 6 weeks? There was no phone yet remember?  How could a mother, who supposed to love the last child she ever gonna have, not get anxious about how her baby was doing in a day? Why didn't she take Cat with her? She certainly can bring a maid for Cat and arrange so nobody found out that she had a daughter (would it be a nice event? the hide and seek game). And how slow minded she was in finding out that the people of Ballyhara scared of Cat? I'd say she didn't care a bit about Cat, all she thought was I I I me me me.  <br />2. When Fenton bluntly asked her to marry him, stating the plain terms of their marriage, I thought, well, Scarlett would certainly open her eyes wide now, but no. She accepted the proposal just because she thought Rhett would get a new baby form Anne and Cat would have a clean reputation, thanks to Fenton's money and title. God's nightgown! Clean reputation? From whom? The English? Who cared? Cat was unsafe from the Irish, not English! And Scarlett worsened it by accepting the proposal. Where her devotion to her love of her land and people? Gone the woman I was getting to know. Back to the Fiddle-dee-dee air headed girl who would stop at nothing. But at least that girl loved Tara with all her heart. This Scarlett... I'm sorry to say, I don't know her at all. <br /> <br />So now I think the miniseries version is much better than the book except for the misfit actor and actress. I wish they spent more time in casting. Would someone make a remake please?	2005-02-28

I feel like I was reminded what a very good story is like and am amazed to still find it as engaging as I read before. But now, there's a plus, you HAVE to read The Thief first to get the true feeling of this book. I hadn't read that one when I read Attolia the first time and there had been times I felt a bit lost on the comments and thoughts that specially involved Eugenides, Eddis and Attolia. Now that I have, the experience is enriched and I fall in love again with The Queen of Attolia, deeply. It is a total satisfaction to understand the love story behind the big picture. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the interaction between the characters and between character and gods. You could get the message without feeling being preached. The main characters fought, lost and won with you, gave you the anguish, irony, love and joy to your heart. While the politics and war proceedings colored the story more than The Thief's, they didn't bog me down. They even gave you a background that helped you understand the personality of each character. Furthermore, there was a conversation between Eugenides and a goddess which held a truth that we all need to know, if you belief in God or gods, without being too religious about it. <br /> <br />Some may say that the story is for much older kids, but I think everybody who enjoys The Thief, can read this one right away. All I can say is this book is as good as The Thief, maybe with a love story, but I say, it's as good! You can not read only one of them! <br /> <br />So, reaching the end, I think there is a premise for a third book. I hope it will come out soon because I do care what would happen to the characters in The Thief and Attolia next and their offspring.	2005-02-09

He was an excellent one, with attitude, pride, wit and of course, a 'big' secret of his own. I totally enjoyed his interaction among the Magus group. From the first page, you will build a maze in your mind, trying to guess who was Gen, what was he going to do next and why did he do what he did. It's like starting from the folded end of a folded rope and ending to find the start and the end of the rope tied majestically, with the gods' meddling in it :). <br /> <br />I couldn't stop being surprised and touched by the relationship bertween the Magus and Gen, a not-successful too-much-bragging thief the Magus thought he was. How the clash between them changed into a deep and honorful friendship. Not to mention Gen's outright comments that sometimes got the best of him and his effort to place Gen back into just a tool to steal. I can't get enough of it. Mrs. Turner surely knows who her characters were. <br /> <br />In the end... No, I don't want it to get ended coz I will pick The Queen of Attolia right from my shelf next... I think I will get back to this book after I finished rereading that one too after a looong time :))  <br /> <br />Thank you for waking me up from a long dull slumber. This is more than a 10 starred worth review for it.	2005-02-02

Sometimes Mattie's pace of mind can make you want to shake her to just wake up! But that only shows how different it is to be really living the period than just reading it. <br /> <br />The murder case, which built up by including some of Grace Brown's letters, are well combined with Mattie's fictional life. The bitterness and the realization that came from it were used to help Mattie decide what to do with her life. I must admit that I don't quite catch why Grace's death could motivate Mattie to set her mind other than they were both teenage girls and one had failed to continue her life because of wrong choices she made and their persistence to believe things according to what they want to believe. Grace still believed in Chester 'Carl' though he said about having fun without her and Mattie believed in secure feeling with her boyfriend though he was certainly lack interest in her passion with books. <br /> <br />What interest me most are the words, the main thread in this book. Whether how words are not just words and all the new terms I have never known such as gravid, which had its moment when Grace's ghost said it. With a vigorous poem as opener, some stories about famous authors and some poems for comparisons and nuances, added up the volume of thoughts in it.	2005-01-27

I could feel my heart goes up and down along with Carolina's. I always have this curiosity with Hades which made me pick this book and thankfully I did :) <br /> <br />I have a little problem though, It is the language used which makes the gods like modern supermen and superwomen put at ancient time. Even the twangs and jargons of Lina's didn't make Hades confused. That in someway diminish the divine value. But it is still one a very lovable story.	2005-01-14

Lucy Honeychurch, a young girl from a bourgeois middle-up class, decided to look at the world by visiting Florence in spring time, chaperoned by her elder cousin, Miss Charlotte Bartlett. What was started by an argument about a room with a view developed into an impulsive kiss from George Emerson amid the violets thus ended the Florence period in a flight to Rome, away from the 'bold' suitor.<br /><br />Now, George Emerson was not a brackish bold person. He was just a passionate one, who had deep feelings about anything and was in a distress mood over 'everything doesn't fit' and there was no reason for him to enjoy life, though he didn't intend to commit suicide. While his father is an outright-spoken person which didn't fit nicely with English stiff etiquette style. Together, they were misfits among English tourists in Florence's Bertolini Pension. But a murder scene just took place right before Lucy's eyes and George, coincidentally, was able to help her away from the mass. From then on, his dour view of the world was changed and he discovered the wanting to live his life and Lucy found some extend of the deep emotion of a George Emerson.<br /><br />His impulse to kiss Lucy is understandable for a passionate guy, who was unprepared, caught the most beautiful sight of a lovely Lucy, who had revived him, among the violet blooming on the hill where you can have the best view of Florence. But unfortunately, the kiss was also seen by Miss Bartlett and that certainly put a chaos feeling to Lucy. Being forbidden to tell the accident to her mother or anyone else and fled to Rome the very next day, she did not have time to think her feeling over and quickly countered and proposed by Cecil Vyse, the son of her mother high society acquaintance in Rome.<br /><br />The uncertainty, self-denial and buried feeling masked all her actions. The frivolity and passionate spirit that loved the Beethoven music just went under beneath the hypocrisy of 'clever' society standard. Would she discover her true self and feeling at the right time? Or should George go back to his previous gloomy state? What would the so called clever society think?<br /><br />Find the funny but thoughtful lines in between and be invigorated by Beethoven!feeling masked all her actions.

Not a boring moment despite the political intrigues and the building up of the alternate world, Terre D'Ange (situated about France nowadays). The culture society is described well, given little by little along the way, not in a full history lesson, except for explaining the religion foundation of The Blessed Elua and His Companions. The story about who was Elua itself is a new thing for me and close related with crucifixion tale. <br /> <br />Against the strong religion and political background, Phaedr, a whore's unwanted get, adopted by Anafiel Delaunay and raised as the rarest scion of Kushiel, in other word, an anguisette, the right hand of the Punisher Angel and also as a spy. In the end of her lessons, she found herself in the mist of political turmoil, with the Princes of Blood trying to take the throne from a very old King and his young granddaughter by way of marriage or force. <br /> <br />Who was Anafiel? Why was he so interested in political game and using Phaedre and Alcuin, his other student, both as pawn and spy? Befriended from childhood by Hyacinthe, a Tsingano boy who could see the future, Phaedre tried to find out the truth which only made her rue the day she found it out.  <br /> <br />Spiced with 'chaste' romantic relationship between Phaedre and a Cassiline brother (though I'm sure will develop in the next book), this dark romance novel is a hard-put to be put down. A sensually engrossing story.	2005-01-06

I just cried when I read it. Bravo to Ms. Wein \(^o^ )/ <br /> <br />I won't recite any summary here since it's already been done. I thought I would never ever want to pick anything related with Arthurian legend since it has been depicted many times through movies. But voila!! This book is not talking on the legend, but about the people, especially Medraut, which is considered the irony antagonist, being the high king's first born but not the heir to the throne.  <br /> <br />If I hated Medraut in Arthurian movies (The Mist of Avalon, The First Knight, etc), I LOVE this Medraut. I care what he felt, why he did this/that. It was such a feat! Food for mind! <br /> <br />I'm off to pick up Coalition.	2005-01-06

I've been told that this book is very valuable and from watching the movie 'Eloise',  I just jump to the chance of buying this. Such a slim book for invoking deep thoughts. Simple language yet indepth meaning even if you don't have a clue who Antoine de Saint-Exupry was (The Little Prince is thought to be a disguised autobigraphy).  <br /> <br />Open with the tale of a child trying to communicate his thought to adults (his parents) by drawing a boa constrictor from outside and inside. How he had problem to explain it, his conclusion that adults need more explanation about things than children who knew them by heart and the ending of his artistic debut (this part was a witty one, makes you ask yourself, who are you? an ignorant adult, who needs much explanation, or a child, who understand things by heart).  <br /> <br />And then, when this child grown to be a pilot (after cut from his artist one), he crashed his plane into a dessert. In the middle of nowhere, came a little child, in grand apparel like a prince, asking to draw him a sheep! Bewildered, he draw it, with a few attempts, since his only drawing ever was the boa constrictor. Then the tale of the little prince (the pilot named him because the child had never answer any questions he asked nor gave him any name) began. <br /> <br />There is one part about stars near the end which touch me so deeply though I don't really feel right about the little prince's decision in the end since it did not reflect the creativity by which he came to Earth. <br />Overall, read it and find what the really serious matters are in your life.	2004-12-10

It was opened by the mysterious conversation between the Builder and his assistant about the building of a city called Ember that needed to be kept hidden for at least 200 years and after the time was up, the instructions for leaving it. In this city with pitch black sky, the people only had electricity light bulbs as light source and vegetable from small crop plants as their staple food. They was told to have unlimited supply of can foods, clothes, medicine, tools, etc which turned out to be dwindled nearing the year of 241. There were no production in this city, let alone clothes manufacture. All supply comes from the storage and foods come from greenhouses which were equipped with photosynthesis lamps and some beehives for honey.  <br /> <br />Outside its known territory, the Unknown Region, was a very dark area and no one from Ember had ever managed to go into it. Their main problem was they didn't have a movable source of light since all the lights attached to an electric cable. There were so much forgotten and unknown facts in this city that to us just a common knowledge like things about heaven, boat, animals etc. The population just adapted their way of life only knowing that the city was build by the Builders and there was no other city than Ember. <br /> <br />Big problem began when the generator for producing the electricity was starting to crumble apart and the food became scarce. It seemed the end of the world was coming for them. Some thought to search for other place but they never made it far into the Unknown Region without light. At that time, miraculously Lina found the long lost Instructions for leaving which was a bit destroyed and incomplete. Together with Doon, she embarked on a mission to find the way out of Ember. <br /> <br />What a chilling and thought provoking idea presented by this book. It reminds me of a movie about a family who built and lived in underground bunkerfor decades but in this case, centuries. The details and the dialogs were well told and sometimes I just didn't expect it. It would be very nice to see this one made into movie. Highly recommended.	2004-12-09

It turned out like reading a fairytale put into the real world, with places and time in history. It was so amazing :) and the heroine not just win the white bear then married him, happily ever after. This book gave a more believable start, process, climax and ending with help from magic since the cursed bear was born out of magic (the goblin's) too so it was only fair. <br /> <br />I only have small problems in reading it. There were some dialog/thought not properly put into a character and they sometimes made me stop for a while to think it over. I also feel the start was kinda slow. But overall, I enjoy this story of Rose and her White Bear, specially about the birth-direction myth.  <br /> <br />A fairytale came to life :)	2004-11-30

The story was so unpredictable and enchanting without using so much magic hocus pocus in it (except for the future sightings). The 'real' magic is lied within yourself for as long as you live, you can do anything if you put all your strength and thought in your effort. A real fantasy one. <br /> <br />The story was started from the invasion of King Kareed of Archeld into Bellandra which was caused by Kareed's ambition to break the legend that Bellandra, being the owner of the magical sword, Sword of Bellandra, was invicible to its enemy. It turned out to be useless in the hand of its ignorant king, King Veldon of Bellandra. In the aftermath, Prince Landen of Bellandra, was captured, intended to be Princess Torina's slave. But she freed and befriended him. The relationship came to the test when the ambitious Vesputo worked his way to gain the crown by lies, trickeries and betrayals. <br /> <br />The narative was easy to follow (and imagine) and there are so many beautiful proverbs, lines that gave me thoughts such as 'the moment is vast' which I gathered that though in a moment (some say less than a second), there are so many things can happen so you must treasure every moment. My favorite line (not exactly the same) 'Emid would have no other best warrior student than a prince reared in peace' . Got the beautifully lined irony? <br /> <br />I just hope I can get my hands on The Healer's Keep soon! <br />Please read it and be enriched by its beauty.	2004-11-30

I think the main idea still maintained the romantic side and yet the main plot of wellknown Tam Lin was given a bit fresh twist. <br /> <br />In here, the man in trouble was called Thomas Lynn and the heroine was Polly. It was said the relationship between them took 4 years to grow and that certainly gives the intensity of it. After the 4th year, something bad happened and Polly found herself forgetting all about Thomas. Fortunately, a book brought her memory bits by bits though it was not intended to. From here the wild chase started. <br /> <br />The fairy world was represented in the family Thomas Lyn related to, which kept reminding me of the mafia (only-family meetings, big crowds). <br /> <br />There was a bit confusing twist happened in the end of the story which why I gave only 4 stars. The end was not a bad one, original one I should say, but you have to pay extra attention to the words.	2004-11-19

The original story turned out to be taken from an opera (stated in the Author's note) which made this story more like a new one to me rather than retelling. <br /> <br />I was intriqued by the view of the world used and sometimes got confused because of the description meant to describe the distinction between light and dark. It is understandable because the author wanted to build the young world. It was tricky when you want to describe something like light and dark (plus their dominion). <br /> <br />The story itself was fast-flowing but I was a bit disturbed by the witty comments. They sometimes didn't get through my surface understanding and I was forced to think about each sentences, which was kind of annoying (and certainly didn't go with witty comment which should get you laughing). <br /> <br />The second characters are well developed since all of the young ones got their own point of view of the events. <br /> <br />Overall, I say this book was a new source of story and, without the hard-understood witty comments, it was a fun read.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-29

It was amazing to know what's going on in a teenager's mind abroad. I found myself comparing it with my own and wishing if only our language teacher had asked us to do that kind of penpal project, I would have found myself in the crowd too. <br /> <br />There are some issues gave my some thoughts to ponder on, such as this: <br />The story brought up the children's privacy issue which was interesting since parents sometimes need to know what's in their children's head if something goes wrong. This point was actually broken by the girls themselves by breaking into the culprit's bedroom which I think is a private area, although they had just declared the their amazing declaration about how fragile and what it meant by someone (teacher) breaking into their private stuff (when they were accused). <br /> <br />I know that the breaking the culprit's private stuff was needed to release the girls and it was very wrong for teacher to just breaking the girls' private stuff when their aledgement was not strongly based (the evidence being that someone had told them was really lame to be used by the Form Mistress, I agree).  I guess this comes back to the statement: anyone must have prooved and strong enough reason for breaking other's privacy regardless a child's or a grown up's. So that leaves me to the 'insane' Form Mistress. Why could she ever have that attitude towards her own school's students? <br /> <br />It made the adults in this book (specially the teacher) looked bad, but that problem was balanced by the parents' effort to support their children and also without their parents, they might not be able to go free with their argument. Other than that issue, the progress of the penpal project and Cassie's problem were heart-warming. What a way to see yourself and the world.	2004-10-28

The description was vivid, even the tiniest details of reaction/thought which are usually not mentioned in this kind of story, can take you back to reality but somehow managed to keep your environment with the goblins which sound a bit odd to you maybe but it happened to me. <br /> <br />Maybe the way Ms. Bell building her character and situation that was easily accepted and consistent throughout the book. The politics reasons in conflict with the goblins' was so well developed that you can not just say right or wrong about each side. This book really show you how it was like to have something in the middle, when everything has its own right and wrong. Yet all was told in not-so-flourish language. <br /> <br />Although I think the way out for the ending was a bit too coincidental (because I feel it was too simple but again maybe I wouldn't like it better any other way) , the last chapter brought a lot more feeling to the whole story.  My eyes just soaked a bit with a big smile on my face after reading the last word. <br /> <br />What a gem. I simply love it :)	2004-10-22

Well, read Wicked and think again. <br /> <br />I admit that I haven't read Wizard of Oz before and only have watched the Judy Garland's once. So the first chapter really made me want to know more of it since it related to both stories, Wizard and Wicked. <br /> <br />After the opening chapter, the rest are divided in 5 parts. The first one starts to tell you the Wicked Witch of the West's parents and early childhood. The second part is about her life at college and her first action to mark her adulthood. In the third one, her brief love life. Fourth, the start of her life as a witch, and in the fifth, the last moments of her life before the encounter with Dorothy. <br /> <br />It is full of politics and social intrigues, religion debates and life that you never knew existed in Oz. Oz has become not just a fairytale land, but a real, living country with its problems. Along the way, you will get to know who were the real character behind Wizard of Oz. Was the Wicked Witch really wicked? Why did she called herself witch? Who was the Good Witch Glinda? What the term of the East and West Witch's sisterhood? And Who was the wizard? You'll find surprises till the very end. <br /> <br />The story itself kept me going although there were some unusual and scientific vocabularies (just keep a dictionary near you). There was a sense of irony in it and deep human feeling and thirst in a Witch life.  <br /> <br />So had the Witch always been a witch all her life? Find the answer yourself.	2004-09-29

This is the best book I've read this month or maybe this year! The story is dark, mysterious and full of action. Reading it was like watching a movie directed by Tim Burton, George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg, with dark foulsome enemies, ghoulish creatures and heart thumping actions.  <br /> <br />Composing the story to reach the final destination of a single question: What is the purpose of your existence?, it started from some parallel events happening in London, after the Vernichtung (destruction -&#62; a bit like WW). London, in the early Age of Reason, half of its area destroyed and marauded by wych-kins which have the ability and appearance like old lore beasts having been resurrected. Who ere they? Where were they from? What did they want? Why were they only known to exist after the Vernichtung? <br /> <br />In mist of the battle between humankind and the wych-kin, Thaniel Fox, a wych hunter and a son of legendary one, was fighting at the front line, companied by his ex-tutor, the eccentric Ms. Bennet. On one night of his hunting, he met a lost girl, Alaizabel Cray, who seemed mad and disoriented. Starting to feel something for her, Thaniel tried to find out whether she was just mad or there was something going on. <br /> <br />Alaizabel turned out to be the key to the biggest conspiracy that was conspiring to bring the the ultimate evil to earth. <br /> <br />Interweaving with the Thaniel's story is the infamous Jack the Ripper like story. A serial killer who murdered women by night with his surgeon knife. Who was he? Read on and you'll see that every character had a purpose in this story. <br /> <br />What would happen next? Could Thaniel and others intercepted the conspiracy? What was the forces outside their will whose only weapons are coincidences, unlikelihood and happenstances? <br /> <br />Read it, Be amazed by it and Read it over again!!   <br />This certainly won't be the last book I read from Mr. Wooding.	2004-09-08
US	30632463	R2T8ZR50U2YSXX	0689835906	127191876	Beast	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Beast with A Heart	Wow, the idea of the infamous Beast being a Persian prince, Orasmyn, is really well thought of. Based of some facts (explained in the end part of the book by Ms. Napoli), it makes sense to pull the story like it is plus it gives the romantic air in the book. <br /> <br />Reciting with style the story of the Beauty and the Beast from the Beast perspective with a fairy as antagonist (not male macho character in Disney version). You really get to know who the man behind the Beast as he grew up all along his journeys and torments. While Belle was a dutiful and smart girl with value which attracted the Beast. <br /> <br />A little too vivid with the lion story part but the feeling added to the drama. Very romantically clever retelling and certainly not boring. <br />I just wish there was one more chapter or epilog in the ending for explaining some detail undescribed when Orasmyn was still in lion shape (like Bell's color?).	2004-09-02

The frase: 'your worst enemy is your own self' is vividly portrayed. <br />Started by a mistake done by an old powerful mage, Atrix Wolf that ends a war between Kardeth and Pelucir. A mistake which caused the uproar and tragedy in human world and fairy world. <br />In the face of the destruction he had caused, Atrix buried himself for 20 years until the heir of Pelucir called him back through a book written by Atrix himself right after the war. <br /> <br />The book itself contained spells seemingly harmless enough for a beginner mage. But when Talis of Pelucir tried to study them, there were actually other meanings behind every words written which endangered both his and his brother, the King's life for the true meaning of the words led to a black terror that had only one intention, Death. <br /> <br />The black terror was made by Atrix's spell and by the destructive spell, he torn the world of fairy, separating the Queen of the Woods, from her consort and daughter. By her, Atrix was forced to finish what he had started years ago. <br /> <br />The language is so enchanting, it almost put a spell on your mind. You can also make up some delicious recipes from here. The description itself made me hungry everytime I read about tha chapters concerning the castle's kitchen.  <br /> <br />High recommended	2004-08-24

You got entertained and can't get enough. The girls' wits and inner charm really made this book very enjoyable. <br /> <br />Starting as a correspondence project, it built into a magical story that includes all the exciting twists you usually find in YA books. I just have one complaint though. The story between James and Cecy was too short!! <br /> <br />But all in all, this book worthed the money and the time :)	2004-08-06

The ending was triumphant and glorious but not in the sense for the main characters, Aeriel and Irrylath.  <br /> <br />I wish there could be a way to gather them, but the destruction of the world was a too big problem to be postponed. I was reminded of Spiderman's phrase : With great power comes great responsibility. While Spiderman get his chance to be able being close with MJ, while Aeriel  was not, given only a few hours with her prince, and the next, Ravenna's task made her to part with him, for good. Not the ending I was expecting. The way of the world is already unjust but should Aeriel got that too after all she had bore and done?	2004-07-28

I am fond of reading YA books and so far, this is totally different from other vampire's book. The setting, which at the beginning kind of confusing, started to make sense if we imagined ourselves living on the moon (another new idea, vampire - night - moon).      This vampire, the \\"Darkangel\\" who stole Eoduin, to be his bride and Aeriel, to be his brides' maid, was a halfmade vampire. He still had soul dan a trace of goodness that made Aeriel (and me still) loved him. Instead of taking revenge for having made Eoduin and the previous 12 brides into wraiths, she decided to save and free him from the White Witch that intended to make him a \\"darkangel\\" son.      With the guidance of the first of three stanzas of the Lady Ravenna, Aeriel started her journey to save the ones she loved and ultimately, the world.	2004-07-28

You can start guessing from the first but after you get the last chapter, you'll have your reward nicely. <br />  <br /> Aeriel's journey continued after saving the halfmade &quot;Darkangel&quot; and change him back into a mortal Prince Irrylath. Their return to Easterness (Isterness) was greeted by the prince's mother, Lady Syllva and his secondborn brothers. Engulfed by his past sins, Irrylath kept distance with his &quot;Darkangel&quot; fourteenth wife despite of Aeriel's effort.  <br />  <br /> Such a heartwrenching situation despaire her. But her task was not over yet. With the help of the other 13 angel brides, she got the second of the three of The Lady Ravenna's stanzas and set of to fulfill the prophecy. Her main quest was to find the lost lons before the Withe Witch found them. <br />  <br /> Will she succeed? Can she cross the distance between her and Irrylath?	2004-07-28

Begin with the idea based from the much-talked-about alien, Ms. Engdahl turned it into a concept that what if the ancient things, such as magic, dragon, wizards, witch, beyond our capability to understand, was things from another planet, another world, with civilization higher than ours? <br /> <br />This book really made me think and even helped me in someway to add to my understanding about human, life and alien. A deep thoughtful science fiction story about human civilization evolution.	2004-07-22

Plus the adjustment she has to make among new people and custom in a girl dorm school, where she found her circle of friends.<br />Set in the end of nineteenth century, Gemma was a girl with some very revolutionaire independence thoughts and some of them clicked something in me and reminded me of the power of female gender (so awesome). There are also a companion character, Miss Moore, her teacher, who gave more sights on choices in life and the balance between light and dark in lessons she had, accompanied with a famous poem by Lord Tennyson, The Lady of Shalott.<br />And there was also a romantic part in it (which I'm very grateful of) between Gemma and an Indian boy, who followed and watched her whereever she goes. I think this can be developed into an intense relationship.<br />I do hope there will be sequel to this because the journey of Gemma and her friends has just begun and there is no turning back, as once you make a choice, whether it would turn out to be a good or a bad one, you just have to accept the consequences and live with it.	2004-06-30

There was the heroine (which I like as atopic in a story), the handsome magician, the shapechanger, the giant, and the court. But all was mixed and composed into so and so story.<br />There is no depth in it that makes me thinking afterward. I'm just glad I made it till the last page without ruining the book.<br />I guess I should be more careful next time.	2004-06-22

I remember it as a very funny, romantic and adventourous one.<br />So, without a second thought, I bought this book and, from story side, my opinion still the same. Except...<br />I know, Mr. Goldman did a very good job in abridging the heavy book, which if I ever got the change to read the real Mogernstern's, if the description is right, I will throw it or put it somewhere I won't see.<br />But, there are something I still want to know in detail like Westley's youth story, since he is the main goodlooking hero character, it is reasonable to be wanting to know more of him, not just about Fezzik and Inigo.<br />So despite of the story, which I am gladly give a 5 star, I gave Mr. Goldman's a 4 (and a half, but there's no halves in comment tool).<br />And I also very much want to read the rest of Buttercup's Baby.

Loyalty, honor and last but the most important thing, Love, amid the clashing force in Scotland against English invasion.    The story was opened with a tragedy that befell Gwenyth, the smallest daughter of Sir John Comyn, the traitor whom had been killed by Robert the Bruce (was a to-be King of Scotland).    Gwenyth, being shocked by the death of her father, planned a revenge to strike at Bruce with the Balliols which was declaring that the throne of Scotland should be belong to them. She was to be married with Edward Balliol to strenghten the power against Bruce.    Unfortunately, on the way to meet Edward, she was kidnapped by the gang leader of Clan Chattan, Leod, who had a cruel intention to overtake the chieftain of Chattan position from Adam Mackintosh, the rightful heir.    With his black intention, Leod tried to set Adam on risky position by assaulting Gwenyth (who was in disguise as a servant) on one gathering day in his laird. Gwenyth, receiving the horrible shock, was told to appoint Adam as her rapist while she knew it wasn't him. Somehow, she had to survive and rid of herself from the cursed Leod and at the same time, safe Adam's life. Would God also leave her now like when she had been praying for deliverance when she was assaulted?    Was Adam the answer to her prayer?    The battle between hope - faith in God and despair flowed though the story, of how a broken faith can be restored by loyalty, honor and a profound love.	2003-09-03

Please don't get me wrong. I really like the story coz it's full of action and most of all, the main character, Alanna, was a heroine who could be the best fighter and also still a woman :). Well, no problem with that.<br />What I don't like about is the romance part. Alanna sounded like an (almost) easy woman. I almost feel petty with George, Poor guy, especially when Alanna get together with Dragon (what kind of relationship is that? Did she even consider George?). Anyway, that's my opinion. If you have no problem with that, Let yourself enjoy the series then.	2003-07-22

It's a fast pace one, maybe a bit of necessary information, but not dragging you in a noticeable way.<br />It is a kind of sad to find that a big-roled character died, but the consolation seemed to apply to me (I have lost my mother recently).
