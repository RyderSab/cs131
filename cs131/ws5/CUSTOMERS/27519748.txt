Being a huge fan of the Les Miserables musical, I borrowed this book at the library hoping to be able to play some of my favorite songs on the piano. I was not disapointed!<br /><br />Since I play piano by playing the guitar chords giving for each song, I was so happy to find that the book contained all the chords that I needed to play the songs.<br /><br />From the start I was able to play all the songs pretty well (with the exception of 'Stars', but that's because I barely know the tune to begin with, lol), and with practice I was able to play many of them VERY well.<br /><br />Its a fantastic book. I have had so much fun singing the songs and accompaning myself on the piano!	2005-08-26

It includes some fine photos, and for people who like to collect Carly memorbilia, this book is for you.	2005-04-14

Madeline Beck (or just plain Maddie for short) is a 13-year-old girl living in Long Island, New York.<br />Her dad is a naval airman stationed in the Pacific, and Maddie and her mother have just moved to Long Island.<br />Maddie isn't making any friends at her new school, and she hates the dopey boarding house she and her mother live in.<br />That all changes when she makes friends with a boy named Johnny Vecheeo. Together they organize a special club for kid who want to help the war effort. They collect scrap metal, rubber, and aluminum. They're even invited to be in big parade!<br />But when Maddie's father is badly hurt during a raid, Maddie loses all interest in the club. She gets depresses and insecure, and she thinks the only way to fight it is to do something very brave: walking alone on the beach at night, which is illegal by the coast guard<br />During one of her treks, she encounters what she thinks is the coast guards who warn her never to come back. But soon Maddie is convinced that something more sinister is behind the midnight encounter. Will she find out who really stopped her, and will she find out in time? Read this suspenseful book to find out!<br />I really enjoyed this book, but one annoying thing was all the `bad' words in the book; somehow the book wasn't quite as enjoyable because I had to stop every other page and use a black pen on it. Also, I thought the `romance' in this book was a little silly and unnecessary, can't a girl and boy be friends without all the mushy stuff?<br />Aside from all that, this was a pretty good book with an excellent story line, and I would recommend it to anyone.	2004-05-11

One night I planned on reading one chapter and ended up reading several. So if you do read this book, you will not be bored.<br />But aside from that, this book tells you about gymnast's trouble with anorexia and bulimia, and how some girls starved themselves to make themselves look thin.<br />I think if you're going to show the bad side to gymnastics, you have to show the good side as well. Yes, girls did starve themselves, and coaches did call them degrading names, but the author didn't tell about the girls who didn't starve themselves, about the coaches that treated their gymnasts firmly but with respect, and the rewards that came with that. This book was entirely one-sided, and it could leave you with a bad taste in the mouth if you're not careful.<br />I was in a webchat with Shannon Miller not too long ago, and I asked her what she thought about the book. She said that she hadn't read it because she 'preferred not to read fiction', and that she knew what was true and what wasn't. I believe her! One of the things I read in there said that Steve Nunno was only into coaching to get what he could get out of it. Joan Ryan, the person who wrote this book, has some serious catching up to do.<br />I also think that some of the comments about Bela Karolyi were exaggerated. Yes, he did call his gymnast's names, but I don't think he was as cruel as the book says. If he was, why did Kerri Strug go back to him when he came out of retirement? If he had really mistreated her, than she would have stayed as far away from him as possible. I found it hard to believe everything that this book said about him.<br />This was the book that gave gymnasts so much trouble when it was published, and I can see why. Some of the stories will shock to no end, but if you really must know how it was, then read this book. But be warned! IT IS NOT ALL TRUE!!!possible.

I was pleasantly surprised!<br />This book is full with stories about Shannon, and it gives you some insight into her life, career, and faith. It was nice to finally read some things written by Shannon, not about her.<br />If you want to read about Shannon's life in her own words, read this book. You won't be disappointed!<br />And no, Shannon does not tell you how to improve your life, she only gives suggestions and explains how different things worked for her, and could work for you.<br />NOTE: This book is not a biography. It's only a bunch of stories strung together, but any die-hard gymnastic fan should read this book.	2004-05-11

I looked her up on the Internet, and the rest they say is history.<br />Through the Internet I discovered the Magnificent Seven, and I found this book at our library. I couldn't have been more satisfied!<br />The Magnificent Seven was a team of US girls that consisted of Amanda Borden, Amy Chow, Jaycie Phelps, Shannon Miller, Dominique Dawes, Dominique Moceanu and Kerri Strug. These talented gymnasts won the very first Olympic Gold team medal in US. Gymnastic history.<br />This book has very informative biographies about each girl, complete with full color photos. It is very well written, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the Magnificent Seven, or just want to see some great pictures about them.	2004-05-11

This book is an autobiography that Dominique Moceanu wrote before heading to Atlanta in the 1996 Olympics.<br />Dominique Moceanu was perhaps America's favorite gymnast at the time, and she was so famous that she wrote her autobiography before going to the Olympics, instead of after. I would have preferred it after, because I would love to hear about her experience in Atlanta.<br />The book is very well written and had many good photos and it gave me an informative look into the life of Dominique.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to anyone.	2004-05-11

This book tells you how she coped with her injures, about her training, and her relationship with Steve Nunno.<br />Of course, since Shannon's mother wrote it you get a little one-sided view, because after all, in her mother's eyes Shannon can do nothing wrong. But Shannon's mother tried very hard to be accurate, and overall I was left with a very good impression.<br />Before I read this I didn't really like Shannon Miller as much as some of the other gymnasts, and I'm not sure why. But after I read this book, it gave me a new understanding of all the hard work Shannon had to put in to become America's favorite gymnast.	2004-05-11

How she came so close to making the All-Around competition in Barcelona, only to be edged out by .14 of a point.<br />This book will make you laugh, cry, and wonder how she could come back after injury upon injury and still continue gymnastics. This book will tell you about her joys and triumphs, and her defeats and despairs.<br />Since I have read this book, Kerri Strug has become my favorite gymnast, not just because of what she did at Atlanta, but what she did to get there. I promise you, if you read this book, you will be left with a profound respect of the girl who could continue on, despite the pain and setbacks.<br />My only recommendation is read it!	2004-05-11

I didn't want to waste my money, so I borrowed it instead. Now I wish I had bought it. This book is fantastic!<br />It's about a girl named Claudia who is fed up with her boring life, so she decided to run away with her bother Jamie to the Metropolitan Museum of Arts in New York City. There she falls in love with an angel statue that is rumored to have been made by Michelangelo, but no one knows for sure. Claudia takes it upon herself to find out who made it before she goes home. Her quest takes her to the home of the strange Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, where the statues true maker is revealed.<br />At first I had been hesitant to read this book because I thought it would have magic or some other stuff and nonsense in it, but I was pleasantly surprised. This story is about Claudia and Jamie's search for the statues maker, and it is also pretty realistic. It's interesting to see how they improvise to make life livable in the great Museum.<br />I think this book is tops, and it is definitely a must-read.	2004-03-20

She could of had a little bit more backbone, but the reason why she didn't tattle on people is because she considered it wrong, and she hated to get people in trouble.<br />No wonder she was so good! Without having a lick of work to do, she had plenty of time to devote to self-improvement.

Victoria is an English princess, but being a princess doesn't mean exactly as she pleases.

She also records the day when she discovers that she is next in line to the throne.<br />I was a mite disappointed with this book when I discovered that Victoria is only nine when she starts this book, but I guess it was because all the other Royal Diary books are about older girls.<br />But don't get me wrong, it's still a good book.

But Mandie solves the mystery in the most unexpected way.<br />I think the parts about George Washington and the 'threat' is very funny. But I don't understand why Mandie and Celia are afraid of elevators. But I guess in those days you couldn't be certain of anything.<br />Finally, Mandie and Celia have a spat.

That means that she will have to go and leave her best friend Louise behind, and travel with snooty Rosemund, and girl who thinks she's above everyone else.<br />From the very biginning there's trouble in the air, which only turns worse when Emilie's older brother Karl and his friend leave right before the ship is to sail.

This forces Emilie to shoulder the responsibility of being the woman of the house until her mother arrives. The task seems impossible, but she puts her faith in God and trusts Him to help her along the way.<br />This is such a marvelous book! My mom gave me the entire series for my birthday once, and this was the first one I read. It was so wonderful to finally read a book about a Christain who made the journey from Europe to America. It was a real encouragement to me, and I reccomend this book to everyone, at all ages. This book will never get old to me!	2003-11-28

The author evidently went through a lot of research to write this book, and his work really paid off. Unlike Jeff Sharra's books, this one had a lot more conversation, which I think is a lot better.<br />I just thought this book was just amazing. I mean, I could not believe the accuracy, all the information, everything.<br />It's about a confederate guerrilla raid on the town of Lawrence, by a bloodthirsty man named William Clark Quantrill who said that every man in the town must be killed, because of their 'Union' sympathys. Some did manage to escape, and the town's women bravely risked their lives to save complete strangers. The whole thing just came alive to me through the author's exciting and well-written narrative.<br />This is a must-read book for anyone who is interested in the Civil War, and anything that is connected to it.	2003-11-19

One of the hard things getting used to is writing in her diary, so her sister Elin offers to write down her entries for her.<br />But Elin isn't always there. Their parents decide to send Bess to Perkin's school for the blind, where Bess can learn to do things for herself. So Bess and Elin agree to write in her diary when she comes home on weekends.<br />This book is absolutely wonderful. Barry Denenburg is a really great writer.<br />One of the parts I liked is where all the students at Perkin's were going to do a play that came right from Barry Denenburg's other book, When Will this Dreadful War be Over. And Bess got the part of Rachel, the slightly cuckoo cousin! What a laugh:)	2003-10-23

Hattie Campbell is a 14 year-old girl whose family is about to leave for the Oregon Trail. Hattie hates leaving her best friend, but she looks forward to the trip with some excitement.<br />But after months on the trail, a near miss crossing a river, flapjacks filled with mosquitoes and accidentally putting hemlock in the stew one night, Hattie begins to wonder if they should have never come on this journey. Everything seems to be turning out so wrong! But Hattie eventually makes it to Oregon city after her long journey Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie.<br />I think this is the first Dear America book I have ever read, and I liked it right from the start. This book has its share of sad, joyous, interesting and even frightening tales to make it a most wonderful book. This is a must read. You'll especially like the part about Pepper getting married. What Hattie and Wane does at the end it particularly funny!	2003-10-23

Remember Patience Whipple is a 12 year-old girl who is sailing on the Mayflower with her family, headed for the New World. Even a young girl has her trials to deal with; one of the least is staying out of the way of snooty Mary Chilton, and coping with a younger sister. But as I said, those are the least of her troubles.<br />And they only escalate once they reach land. Winter is approaching, and they only have a crude cabin to serve as a house. Terrible sickness has set in, and Remember is afraid that one of her family (or even her!) will become ill also.<br />But Remember survives her first season at Plymouth Harbor, and learns a lot along the way.<br />This has got to be one of my favorite books. Everything was so realistic, for a long time I actually thought that it was a real diary, until I read the little thing at the end of the book-'Remember Patience Whipple is a fictional character and her diary is fictional.' What a disappointment! But as long as you're aware of this when you start reading, you shouldn't have any problem with it like I did.<br />This book is a must for any Dear America fans. READ IT!	2003-10-20

Catharine Carey Logan, or better known a Catey, is a Quaker girl living in the Delaware Valley, Pennsylvania. Catey and her family are frightened by reports of Indian raids, but they believe that the Indians will leave them alone if they show trust and love to them.<br />That all changes when Catey and her brother Tomas are captured while on their way to school.<br />Catey is determined not to keep the Indian ways, but she finds herself liking it after a while. And she falls in love with an Indian brave named Snow Hunter who was actually a captive white like her. But when given the chance to go back to her village, will Catey follow the leading of her heart?<br />I absolutely love this book. Even though it's sad enough to make you want to cry, it possesses a sort of charm that keeps you reading till the end.<br />I felt so sorry for Catey. And you will too, once you read this book. I won't spill the beans regarding the ending, so you'll just have to read it your self. I promise you, you won't be sorry!	2003-10-20

Mandie is finally home from school, and is eagerly waiting to investigate yet another mystery.<br />This one is quite different. The people at Mandie's house have been seeing strange lights in an old abandoned shack. Mr. Shaw has enlisted Mandie to find out.<br />Then when a fierce tornado sends Mandie and her friends scurrying to the secret tunnel for safety, Mandie uncovers one of her biggest surprises yet!<br />I was rather surprised with this book. The Mandie in all the other books did things on impulse, sneaking out to find things by herself. The Mandie in this book is rather quieted down, asking for permission to do stuff. Even though that's the way that she should be, the change was so sudden that I was taken back. Also, it isn't Mandie's character to be so compliant . I was glad that she isn't like that in all the books!	2003-08-28

Uncle Ned sends it to Mandie's Uncle Writ to translate it, and Mandie can't wait to see what it says.<br />But when Uncle Ned comes back with the message, he says it is a 'sad, bad message' and will not tell her. Mandie absolutely has to find it, so she finds a way to get down to her Uncle Writ's house to find out what it said by herself.<br />But the message turns out to be more than Mandie can handle. Find out what that message was in 'Mandie and the Quilt Mystery.'<br />I really enjoyed this book, but the one thing that annoyed me was Mandie's impatience. She could absolutely not wait a little while to find out what was written on the quilt. She could not except Uncle Ned's good advice and just leave the quilt alone. I understand her curiosity, but if I were her, I would have been patient and wait until Uncle Ned thought it fit to tell her.<br />But other than that it is really good and I recommend the entire series.	2003-08-28

And she seems to have found it when she thinks she hears a puppy in a dark alley. The problem is, that alley is off-limits. But Mandie will stop at nothing to find it, even if it means breaking the rules and sneaking off after curfew.<br />Things get worse when Mandie loses her locket and her grandmother's silver tea set is stolen. Now Mandie simply has to go back to the alley...even if it means getting in major trouble.<br />I was supremely disappointed with this book. Mandie was just too...disobedient. Normally I like it when the characters are a bit human, but this is way out of hand. This isn't being human, this is sheer stupidity! Just when I thought Mandie was learning something from all those lessons she gets in the other books, she goes and does this crazy thing. But she does get severely punished, if that's any consolation.<br />Maybe it's just me, but this has got to be one of the worst books in the entire series. Read it if you must, but don't put too much stock in it.	2003-08-28

Mandie can't wait to see what it is.<br />But when Mandie arrives, she discovers that Jonathan has left for Long Island! Mandie is itching to find out what the secret is, and she even goes so far as to search Jonathan's room for any clues as to what the secret is, but she finds nothing.<br />Finally, Jonathan comes home. And the secret that he has surprises everyone.<br />For those that are wondering what is between Ms. Taft and Mr. Guyer, this book reveals all.<br />A while ago I entered in a 'contest' to receive a free autographed Mandie book by Lois Gladys Leppard. Imagine my surprise when I was my name on the list of winners! That autographed book is the pride and joy of my Mandie books. Thank you, Ms. Leppard!<br />I liked this book, except there was one major flaw. In 'Mandie and the Quilt Mystery' Polly (Mandie's neighbor) was supposed to be accompanying Mandie and her friends to New York. But when I read this book, it did not mention Polly at all!<br />Also, I think that Mandie was very rude to snoop in the Guyer's house.<br />Other than that, it was good. Be sure to read this great book!	2003-08-28

In the previous book, Mandie and Celia got in trouble for investigating noises during curfew hours. As a punishment, Miss Patience has given them the task of cleaning out the dirty attic.<br />But Mandie and Celia don't mind. They want to find out what's in a blue trunk that Hilda was banging on. But to their great disappointment, they can't find the key!<br />But Mandie won't give up. She is determined to find out what's in there, even though it might get her and other people in trouble.<br />Somehow, this book didn't seem as good as the other ones. I still rate it 5 stars, but it wasn't as catching as the other ones.<br />One of Mandie's great faults is rushing into things without thinking of how her actions might affect others. And that fault is glaringly evident in this book. But hey, nobody is perfect.<br />But this book is still good. It's another great addition to the Mandie books, and I recommend reading them all.	2003-08-25

In the previous book Mandie got in trouble for sneaking away without permission and as punishment she is not allowed to go anywhere for the rest of the summer without an adult. But she's set on finding the treasure that's on a map that she found in her attic, but the map seems almost impossible to follow, and despite all that she still won't give up.<br />Along the way she discovers secrets that she never dreamed of, and helps someone in their work in a very unexpected way.<br />This is the first Mandie book that I ever read, and although it was rather confusing at times, (for instance, I had no idea who Joe or Dimar was,) it made me want to pursue the entire series.<br />This book has got to be one of the best books of the series. Very well written, it gives enough mystery, surprises, thrills, and even sadness to make it outstanding.<br />I love this book, and I hope everyone else does too.	2003-08-25

Mandie has returned to Asheville and school, but something very strange and puzzling is happening. The church bell rings not only 12 strikes at 12 o'clock, but 13. And then when a influenza outbreak stuns the city, the townspeople blame it on the bell. Can Mandie figure out the mystery of the bell and keep herself out of trouble at the same time? Apparently not. But she tries her best and is rewarded by solving the mystery. But then another problem arises. Can she save an innocent man from being jailed? Find out in 'Mandie and the Mysterious Bells'!<br />This book has never failed me. If I want something good to read this book never disappoints me.<br />One thing I like about Mandie is that she is very open and loving, even to people who cause trouble. She can see the good in people and she helps them. That's one of the things I admire in her.	2003-08-25

Someone has been there, and Mandie is determined to find out.<br />But when Mandie and Joe take off to look for clues by themselves, they get in very BIG trouble, which leaves Mandie and Joe in a boat racing down the river. Will they ever get home?<br />Another wonderful book by Lois Gladys Leppard! I liked it all, especially when Joe finds a ruby. Who do you think he's going to give it to when he grows up? :)<br />Some people think that the heroine of the story has to be perfect, but I think it makes them more human if they do something bad once in a while. Nothing really bad, but something'human. (See my review for 'Mandie and the Dark Alley.)<br />On the whole this is a very good book, and I do recommend it.	2003-08-25
